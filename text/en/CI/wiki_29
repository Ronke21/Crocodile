<text>Cork Harbour () is a natural harbour and river estuary at the mouth of the River Lee in County Cork, Ireland. It is one of several which lay claim to the title of &quot;second largest natural harbour in the world by navigational area&quot; (after Port Jackson, Sydney). Other contenders include Halifax Harbour in Canada, Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka and Poole Harbour in England.

The harbour has been a working port and a strategic defensive hub for centuries, and it has been one of Ireland&#x27;s major employment hubs since the early 1900s. Traditional heavy industries have waned since the late 20th century, with the likes of the closure of Irish Steel in Haulbowline and shipbuilding at Verolme. It still has strategic significance in energy generation, shipping, refining and pharmaceuticals development.

==Geography==
The main tributary to the harbour is the River Lee which, after flowing through Cork city, passes through the upper harbour (Lough Mahon) in the northwest before passing to the west of Great Island with the main channel emerging into the lower harbour past Haulbowline Island.

For conservation and navigation purposes, the harbour is often separated into &quot;Upper Cork Harbour&quot; (following the River Lee from Cork city to the towns of Passage West and Monkstown) and &quot;Lower Cork Harbour&quot; (separated from the upper harbour by Great Island).

The depth of the harbour has been measured at between and .

===Islands===
Cork Harbour contains a number of islands of various sizes, some of which are connected to the mainland by bridges. Islands which are or have been inhabited include:

* Great Island – The largest island in Cork Harbour, which includes the town of Cobh
* Fota Island – Containing Fota Wildlife Park, Fota House and the Fota Island Resort Hotel and golf course
* Little Island – A residential and industrial area
* Haulbowline Island – Headquarters of the Irish Naval Service, and former home of the Cork Water Club (1720).
* Spike Island – Former prison island
* Harper&#x27;s Island – Site of the Harper&#x27;s Island Wetland Centre
* Hop Island – Site of an equestrian centre
* Weir Island
* Brick Island
* Corkbeg Island – Site of Whitegate oil refinery
* Brown Island
* Rocky Island – Once housed a magazine building for the Royal Navy. Used by Irish Steel for storage until 2002, and now home to &#x27;The Island Crematorium&#x27;.

===Settlements===
Cork city is located slightly upstream on the River Lee on the northwest corner of Cork Harbour. Several of the city&#x27;s suburbs, including Blackrock, Mahon, Douglas, Passage West and Rochestown lie on Lough Mahon or the Douglas Estuary, both of which are parts of Upper Cork Harbour.

The Lower Harbour has a number of towns around its shores. Passage West, Monkstown, Ringaskiddy and the smaller village of Raffeen are found on the western shore. On the southwestern shore is Crosshaven. Great Island, which forms the northern shore of the lower harbour, houses the town of Cobh. As of 2011, Cobh had a population of about 12,500. The eastern shore is less densely populated, but has two villages Whitegate and Aghada, both home to power plants.

The village of Ballinacurra is on the northeastern spur of the harbour, known as the Ballynacorra River. Due to the recent expansion of the town of Midleton, Ballinacurra has effectively become a suburb of Midleton, so it could also be said that Midleton lies on Cork Harbour.

==Military==
Cork Harbour hosts the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service. Prior to the transfer of the treaty ports in 1938, Cork Harbour was an important base for the British Royal Navy.

Some of the first coastal defence fortifications built in Cork Harbour date to the 17th century, and were primarily intended to protect the approaches to Cork city. In the 18th century, fortifications were built on and opposite Haulbowline Island to protect the anchorage in Cobh - including Cove Fort (1743). Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle were built at opposite sides of the harbour entrance during the period of the American War of Independence.

The harbour&#x27;s military significance increased during the Napoleonic Wars, when the naval establishment in Kinsale was transferred to Cork Harbour. The harbour became an important anchorage, which could be used to guard the entrance to the English Channel and maintain the blockade of France. At this time, the naval dockyard on Haulbowline Island was constructed, as well as a fort on Spike Island (later to become Fort Westmoreland) and a number of Martello Towers and other fortifications were added or improved around the harbour.

The fortifications were developed throughout the 19th century and a further fort, Fort Templebreedy, was added to the south of Fort Camden at the beginning of the 20th century.
At the time of Irish independence, Cork Harbour was included, along with Berehaven and Lough Swilly, in a list of British naval establishments that would remain under the control of the Royal Navy, although the naval dockyard on Haulbowline Island was handed over to the Irish Free State in 1923.

Although the Royal Navy appreciated the location of Cork Harbour, particularly for submarines, which had a significantly shorter range in the 1920s, maintenance of the fortifications became an issue after Ireland became independent. The political uncertainty over the future of the treaty ports meant that the British government was not inclined to invest in their upgrade. Also, at the time of their construction, nobody had considered the possibility of air attack and as they were unable to expand, there was no possibility of adding adequate air cover. Finally, if the Irish Free State was hostile during any conflict, the treaty ports would have to be supplied by sea rather than land, wasting resources. In March 1938, the British government announced that the treaty ports would be handed over unconditionally, and on 11 July 1938, the defences at Cork Harbour were handed over to the Irish military authorities at a ceremony attended by Taoiseach Éamon de Valera.

Since being handed over to the Irish military, most of the military installations have ceased to be used for military purposes. Fort Carlisle was renamed Fort Davis and is used by the Defence Forces for training - but is in a somewhat neglected state. Fort Camden became officially known as Fort Meagher and while no longer in military use, has been subject to renovation by local volunteers and enthusiasts, and can be visited by the public on certain days. The fort was officially renamed as of 11 July 2013 as Camden Fort Meagher, to account for both its British military and Irish military history. Locally, the two forts are sometimes known as &quot;Camden&quot; and &quot;Carlisle&quot;, rather than their official titles. Fort Westmoreland became Fort Mitchell Spike Island prison, and has since ceased use for military or prison purposes. &quot;Spike&quot; was gifted to Cork County Council by the State and has been renovated as a tourist attraction by council workers and volunteers under the supervision of archaeologists. The fortifications on Haulbowline Island however have been maintained, and are now the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service.

==Industry==
Cork Harbour is one of the most important industrial areas in Ireland. While several traditional industries such as shipbuilding at Verolme Dockyards, steel-making on Haulbowline Island and fertiliser manufacturing at IFI (Irish Fertiliser Industries) have ceased in recent years, they have been replaced with newer industries and Cork Harbour is now significant within the pharmaceutical industry. Large international firms such as Pfizer, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen Pharmaceutica (a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson) are significant employers in the region. There has however been some concern since the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, as several of the pharmaceutical companies in Cork have shed jobs, notably Pfizer which announced the loss of 177 jobs in June 2012. There are in excess of 100 other pharmaceutical firms operating in the Cork Harbour area. The main centres of the pharmaceutical industry are Little Island and Ringaskiddy. Ireland&#x27;s only oil refinery, Whitegate refinery, is located on the southeastern shore together with the adjacent Whitegate power station.

==Marine activity==

===Commercial===
Historically, the navigation and port facilities of the harbour were managed by the &quot;Cork Harbour Commissioners&quot;. Founded in 1814, the Cork Harbour Commissioners were reorganised as the Port of Cork Company in 1997.
Vessels up to are capable of coming through the harbour entrance. As the shipping channels get shallower the farther inland one travels, access becomes constricted, and only vessels up to can sail above Cobh.

The Port of Cork provides pilotage and towage facilities for vessels entering Cork Harbour. All vessels accessing the quays in Cork city must be piloted and all vessels exceeding 130 metres in length must be piloted once they pass within of the harbour entrance at a point marked by the Spit Bank Lighthouse which is the landmark boundary for compulsory pilotage.

The Port of Cork has berthing facilities at Cork city, Tivoli, Cobh and Ringaskiddy. The facilities in Cork city are primarily used for grain and oil transport. Tivoli (downstream of the older city quays) provides container handling, facilities for oil, livestock and ore and a roll on-roll off (Ro-Ro) ramp. Prior to the opening of Ringaskiddy Ferry Port, car ferries sailed from here; now, the Ro-Ro ramp is used by companies importing cars into Ireland. In addition to the ferry terminal, which provides a service to Roscoff in France, Ringaskiddy has a deep water port.

The Port of Cork company is a commercial semi-state company responsible for the commercial running of the harbour as well as responsibility for navigation and berthage in the port. In 2011 the port had a turnover of €21.4 million and made pre-tax profits of €1.2 million. This was down from a turnover of €26.4 million and profits of €5.4 million in 2006. Container traffic increased by 6% in 2011 when 156,667teus were handled at the Tivoli container facility, however this was down from a peak of 185,000 TEUs in 2006. The 2006 figure saw the port at full capacity and the Port drew up plans for a new container facility capable of handling up to 400,000 teus per annum at Ringaskiddy. This was the subject of objections and after an oral planning hearing was held in 2008, the Irish planning board Bord Pleanala rejected the plan due to inadequate rail and road links at the location.

Permission was later granted and work started (2018) on the new port.

There has been an increase in cruise ship visits to Cork Harbour in the early 21st century, with 53 such ships visiting the port in 2011. The majority of these cruise ships berth at Cobh&#x27;s Deepwater Quay. Historically, Cobh (under its former name Queenstown) was one of the principal ports through which flowed the stream of emigrants stemming from the Great Famine in the 1840s.

There are also a number of private berths around the harbour, with several centred on Whitegate, Passage West, Rushbrooke, Ringaskiddy and Haulbowline.

===Recreational===
The Royal Cork Yacht Club, claimed as the world&#x27;s oldest, was founded as &#x27;The Water Club&#x27; on Haulbowline Island in the 1720s. When the British Navy took over Haulbowline in 1801, the club moved to Cobh, where their original clubhouse (built in the 1850s) still stands. In the 1960s, the club moved to Crosshaven. There are also boatyards at Crosshaven and two other marinas. There is another marina on Great Island opposite East Ferry, while Monkstown and Blackrock are used for boating, canoeing, windsurfing and jet-skiing. A number of rowing clubs have facilities on the part of the River Lee between Cork city and Blackrock.

<doc id="1053365" wikidata="Q148312" url="?curid=1053365" title="Zat Knight">
<text>Zatyiah Knight (born 2 May 1980) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre back.

Knight had extended spells at Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers and Fulham in the Premier League and the Championship. He finished his career at Reading in the Championship. Knight represented England at under-21 and senior international levels.

==Club career==
===Fulham===
Knight was born in Solihull, West Midlands. Fulham signed him from Rushall Olympic on 19 February 1999. As Knight was not a professionally contracted player to Olympic, Fulham were not obliged to pay a fee for him, but owner Mohamed Al-Fayed sent the club 30 tracksuits as a gesture of thanks. After five years at Fulham, Knight signed a contract extension that would keep him at Craven Cottage until 2008, having established himself under Chris Coleman&#x27;s management.

Knight scored four goals for Fulham, two in the 2004–05 season and two in 2006–07. The first was in a FA Cup match against Watford in a 1–1 draw, his second was a Premier League goal against Norwich City in a 6–0 win. His last goal for Fulham came against Bolton Wanderers in a 2–1 loss. He was arguably Fulham&#x27;s most consistent player in 2006–07, a reward for this was being given temporary captaincy of the club while regular skipper Luís Boa Morte was out injured.

Before a match against West Ham United, it was announced that he had broken his jaw in two places while messing around with his brother. Chris Coleman has been quoted as saying that it takes more than horseplay to break one&#x27;s jaw in two places, but Knight insists there was &quot;nothing sinister&quot; about the incident.

At the start of 2007–08, Knight signed a two-year contract extension with Fulham, contracting him until the summer of 2010. Prior to signing a new contract, Knight was linked with a move away from Fulham, but insisted he wanted to stay at the club and win trophies.

===Aston Villa===
On 29 August 2007, Knight signed a four-year contract with the club he supported as a boy, Aston Villa, for a £3.5 million fee. His last Fulham match was the 2–1 defeat against Villa, in which he played a part in Villa&#x27;s equaliser when an Ashley Young shot deflected off him into the net, although this was later given as Young&#x27;s goal. In the early hours of the day of his transfer (29 August), Knight and his brother Carlos were arrested in a drugs raid on their family home. Knight was released on police bail while Carlos was remanded in custody. Police said that a quantity of drugs were seized at the home. Knight feared that he might miss the press conference announcing his signing but his agent bailed him out and no mention of the incident was made at the press conference. Knight scored a headed goal on his Villa debut in a 2–0 win against Chelsea on 2 September 2007. Knight&#x27;s next goal for Villa did not come until the following season, on 26 December 2008, when Villa were trailing 2–1 against Arsenal at Villa Park. Knight scored the equaliser in the 91st minute of the match, in front of the Holte End, to make it 2–2.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 25 July 2009, Knight signed a three-year contract with Premier League club Bolton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £4 million. Knight made his Bolton debut in the 1–0 defeat to Sunderland on 15 August 2009. He scored his first goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium on 27 February 2010 and this led to a crucial 1–0 home win which lifted the team out of the relegation zone.

Knight&#x27;s contract expired at the end of 2011–12, making him a free agent. However, on 9 July 2012, Bolton announced that he had signed a further two-year contract. Knight often took the captain&#x27;s armband at Bolton when usual skipper Kevin Davies was off the pitch. When Davies left at the end of 2012–13, Knight was named as the new captain for 2013–14. Jay Spearing took the armband when Knight came out of the team and Spearing retained it when Knight returned. On 8 March 2014, Knight scored his first goal in three and a half years when scoring Bolton&#x27;s third in their 5–1 victory over Leeds United at Elland Road. At the end of that season, he was released by the club along with Chris Eagles, Tyrone Mears and Jay Lynch.

===Colorado Rapids and Reading===
On 1 October 2014, Knight signed for Major League Soccer team Colorado Rapids. He played all four of their remaining matches of the season as they finished outside the play-offs, and had his contract terminated by mutual consent on 2 February 2015.

Following his release from the Rapids, Knight went on trial with Watford, before signing with fellow Championship club Reading on 12 March 2015. He was released by Reading on 21 May 2015.

==International career==
Knight made his England debut on 28 May 2005 as a substitute against the United States in a friendly match. He gained his second cap in a friendly against Colombia on 31 May.

==Post-retirement life==
After Knight retired, he moved to Los Angeles. He runs a real estate investment company, and also owns a fragrance line.

<doc id="1053370" wikidata="Q860590" url="?curid=1053370" title="List of weapons and armour in Middle-earth">
<text>The weapons and armour of Middle-earth are all those mentioned J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth fantasy writings, such as &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

Tolkien modelled his fictional warfare on the Ancient and Early Medieval periods of history. His depiction of weapons and armour particularly reflect Northern European culture as seen in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the Norse sagas. Tolkien established this relationship in &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, the first story in &quot;his legendarium&quot; to be written. In this story, the Elves of Gondolin use the mail armour, swords, shields, spears, axes and bows of Northern European warfare. In Tolkien&#x27;s writings, such Medieval weapons and armour are used by his fictional races, including Elves, Dwarves, Men, Hobbits, and Orcs.

As in his sources, Tolkien&#x27;s characters often gave names to their weapons, sometimes with runic inscriptions to show they are magical and have their own history and power.

==Terminology==

Tolkien devised several constructed languages with terms for types of weapons.

* Sword: Noldorin Sindarin: &quot;magl, magol&quot;, North Sindarin &quot;magor&quot;, Quenya: &quot;makil&quot;, &quot;macil&quot;. Specific types of sword were named &quot;lango&quot; (broad sword), &quot;eket&quot;, &quot;ecet&quot; (short sword), and &quot;lhang&quot; (cutlass, sword).
* Dagger, knife: Noldorin Sindarin: &quot;sigil&quot;, Quenya: &quot;cirma, sicil&quot;
* Axe: North Sindarin: &quot;hathol&quot;, Quenya: &quot;pelekko&quot; (Hooker notes the similarity of the Greek pélekys: double-headed axe), Khuzdul: &quot;bark&quot;, pl. &quot;baruk&quot;
* Spear: Quenya: &quot;hatal&quot; also &quot;nehte&quot;
* Bow: Noldorin Sindarin: &quot;peng&quot; also poetically &quot;cû&quot; (&quot;arch&quot;), Quenya: &quot;quinga&quot;.
* Arrow: Quenya: &quot;pilin&quot;, pl. &quot;pilindi&quot;

==Types==

===Swords===

Swords symbolized physical prowess in battle for Tolkien, following Northern European culture. Tolkien writes that Elves and Dwarves produced the best swords (and other war gear) and that Elvish swords glowed blue in the presence of Orcs. Elves generally used straight swords while Orcs generally used curved swords. Both races have exceptions: Egalmoth of Gondolin used a curved sword and the Uruk-hai of Isengard used short, broad blades. Tolkien often mentions the use of shields together with one-handed swords.

===Knives===

Knives are mentioned in Tolkien&#x27;s works, sometimes as backup weapons—such as the unnamed long knife of Legolas the archer. However, some individual knives are given more significance through naming (e.g. Sting, see below). In &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot;, Saruman attempts to stab Frodo with a knife, but is foiled by the mithril shirt worn under his jacket. Shortly afterwards Saruman&#x27;s throat was fatally cut with a knife borne by Wormtongue.

For &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Legolas possessed twin fighting knives carried in sheaths near his quiver.

====Special types of knife====

There are some special types of knife in Tolkien&#x27;s fiction which do not have formal names, but nevertheless play important roles in the plot.

=====Morgul-blades=====

The Witch-king of Angmar, leader of the Nazgûl, used a magical dagger called a &quot;Morgul-blade&quot; to wound Frodo Baggins at Weathertop. The dark magic of the knife gravely affects Frodo&#x27;s well-being, threatening to turn him into a wraith, especially because its detachable point migrated in Frodo&#x27;s body for more than two weeks before it could be extracted, thus causing great damage. Recurring ill effects from the wound contribute to Frodo&#x27;s eventual departure to Valinor. According to the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, the weapon may owe something to the tradition of the &quot;elf-shot&quot; found in Old English medical texts and charms, where it denotes illnesses of presumed supernatural origin.

=====Barrow-blades=====

Tom Bombadil recovers four magical daggers, forged by the Men of Westernesse to fight the powers of Angmar, from a tomb guarded by the Barrow-wight. After opening the barrow and freeing the hobbits, Tom Bombadil gives them the weapons, saying &quot;Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people&quot;. One of these &quot;Barrow-blades&quot; – that given to Merry Brandybuck – proves instrumental in bringing about the death of the Witch-king.

The daggers had varying fates. The Witch-king broke Frodo&#x27;s blade at the Ford of Bruinen. Sam Gamgee left his beside Frodo in Cirith Ungol; it was returned to Gandalf, along with Frodo&#x27;s mithril mail-shirt, by the Mouth of Sauron. Pippin Took used his dagger in the Battle of the Black Gate to slay a Troll. Merry&#x27;s blade is destroyed during his attack on the Witch-king.

===Axes===

Battle axes are especially favoured by Dwarves in Tolkien&#x27;s writings; Gimli uses the battle cry: &quot;Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!&quot; (Khuzdul: &quot;Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!&quot;). For &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Gimli the Dwarf was assigned various axes of different makes during the course of the films.

The Sindarin Elves of Doriath favoured axes as weapons during the First Age. Other notable axe-bearers were Tuor (the wielder of the axe Dramborleg), the Men of the White Mountains who marched to the defence of Minas Tirith in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie (replacing the axe-wielding men of Lossarnach from the book), and a contingent of Easterlings among the besiegers of Minas Tirith.

===Bows and arrows===

Bows of different sizes and construction are featured in Tolkien&#x27;s works. Elves of Lothlórien, Men, and Uruk-hai used longbows, while Elves of Mirkwood and Orcs of Mordor used smaller ones. These bows are said to be made of wood, horn and even steel.

The most famous bowman in Tolkien&#x27;s stories of the First Age of Middle-earth is the Elf Beleg; his bow was named Belthronding, and his arrow Dailir. Infamously Curufin, a lord of the Noldor, attempts to shoot the Elf-princess Lúthien with the bow of his brother Celegorm. His first arrow is intercepted by Huan; Beren attempts to intercept the second shot, and is wounded.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, set in the late Third Age, a bow is the main weapon of Legolas, the Elf-member of the Fellowship of the Ring. When the Fellowship meet Galadriel, she gives Legolas a new bow. He later uses it to shoot all the way across the great river Anduin and bring down an airborne Nazgûl.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy assigns a bow to Aragorn and crossbows to the Uruk-hai. However, in Tolkien&#x27;s writings Aragorn is armed only with the sword Andúril, and crossbows are only mentioned in connection to hunting by Númenoreans in their lost homeland of Númenor.

Sometimes individual arrows are given special mention in Tolkien&#x27;s works. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the &quot;Black Arrow&quot; was a royal heirloom used by Bard the Bowman to kill the dragon Smaug. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the &quot;Red Arrow&quot; was a token used by Gondor to summon its allies in time of need. In the &quot; Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, the Red Arrow is omitted and its role is conflated with the Beacons of Gondor.

Hobbits &quot;shot well with the bow&quot;. The Shire sent archers to the battles of the Fall of Arnor.

===Armour===

Body armour in Tolkien&#x27;s fiction is mainly in the form of mail or scale shirts, in keeping with Ancient and Early Medieval periods of history. In contrast, the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy features later medieval plate armour suits. These kinds of plate armour are not found in Tolkien&#x27;s writings, but plate does appear in the form of individual pieces such as vambraces (forearm guards) or greaves (leg and shin guards). As with other items of war, Elves and Dwarves produced the best armour. The mail shirt forged by Dwarves from the fictional metal &quot;mithril&quot; appears in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, worn in turn by the protagonists Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.

In Letter 211 of &quot;The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;, the author compared the war-gear of the Rohirrim to the Bayeux Tapestry, made during the Norman Conquest of Anglo-Saxon England.

===Helmets===

Battle helmets are commonly used by virtually all races in Tolkien&#x27;s writings. The Rohirrim were partly modelled on the Anglo-Saxons, who wore elaborate helmets; Éomer&#x27;s helmet had a long white horse-tail panache that trailed in the wind. The Crown of Gondor was a jewelled battle-helmet; Aragorn received it at his coronation. Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee use Orc-helmets as part of their disguise in Mordor.

In the First Age, Dwarves made dragon-helms, which were said to protect against Dragons. The most famous of these was the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin.

The Second Age was dominated by Númenor. The Númenórean helmet, the karma, reached particularly elaborate forms. Those of the Uinendili, a guild of mariners, were &quot;made of overlapping plates of metal, the &#x27;fish-crest&#x27; of leather embossed and coloured&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s coloured drawing of the &quot;karma&quot; of a Uinendili captain features on the cover of &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;.

==Named items==

Tolkien emulated his Northern European mythological and literary sources in having his characters give names to their weapons, marking these out as important aspects of character and sometimes as ancient heirlooms. Named weapons in Medieval literature include Hrunting and Nægling in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Tyrfing in the &quot;Elder Edda&quot; and Gram in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. The items illustrate the passage of time and the transfer of power or fate to their future bearers.

===Named swords and knives===

====Anglachel====

Anglachel (Sindarin: &quot;Iron of the Flaming Star&quot;) was a sword forged of meteoritic iron by Eöl the Dark Elf, given to Thingol King of Doriath as a fee for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth. It could cleave all earth-delved iron. Later wielded by Beleg Strongbow and ultimately Túrin; Anglachel was reforged and renamed Gurthang (Sindarin: &quot;Iron of Death&quot;). Túrin used Gurthang to kill Glaurung, the Father of Dragons, and later used the sword to take his own life in recompense for the accidental slaying of Beleg and the unjust slaying of Brandir. The stories endow the sword with a personality; Melian the Maia perceived malice in it as it was given to Beleg Cúthalion, and the elf Gwindor observed that Anglachel (so named then) seemed to mourn the death of Beleg at the hand of his friend Túrin by Anglachel itself. Túrin asked the sword whether it would slay him swiftly if he cast himself on its point, and it responded at length (the only instance of Gurthang speaking with voice). The depiction of the sword was influenced by that of the sword of the Finnish character Kullervo in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

====Angrist====

Angrist (Sindarin: &quot;Iron-cleaver&quot;) was a knife made by the great weaponsmith Telchar of Nogrod, and borne by Curufin. Beren, who had taken it from Curufin, used it to cut a magical Silmaril jewel out of Morgoth&#x27;s Iron Crown; as Beren attempted to remove another, the knife snapped. In the earliest version of Beren&#x27;s story in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, he uses an ordinary household knife; the element of Curufin&#x27;s involvement in Beren&#x27;s affairs came later.

====Anguirel====

Anguirel (Sindarin: &quot;Iron of Eternity&quot;) is the sword forged by Eöl the Dark Elf, similar to Anglachel which was given to Thingol of Doriath in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. It was the mate of Anglachel, was made of the same meteoritic iron, and had the same physical properties and capabilities as Anglachel, but there is no evidence of sentience in Anguirel. Anguirel was kept by Eöl until it was stolen by his son, Maeglin.

====Aranrúth====

Aranrúth (Sindarin: &quot;King&#x27;s Ire&quot;) is the sword wielded by King Thingol of Doriath in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Later the sword of the Kings of Númenor.

====Glamdring====

Glamdring (Sindarin: Foe-hammer) is a sword in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; forged in the First Age by the High Elves of the hidden city of Gondolin. It belonged first to Turgon, the King of Gondolin. Thousands of years later, in , Gandalf discovered it among the hoard of the three trolls in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and he carried it throughout his journeys with Bilbo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring. It was the mate of Orcrist, and like Orcrist would glow blue whenever orcs were nearby. Glamdring was nicknamed &quot;Beater&quot; by the goblins of the Misty Mountains.

====Gurthang====
&quot;See Anglachel&quot;

====Gúthwinë====
Gúthwinë (Old English: &quot;gúð-wine&quot; &quot;Battle Friend&quot;) is the sword wielded by Éomer, third marshal of the Riddermark in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The name is found in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, where the hero uses the word as an epithet for the sword Hrunting, lent to him by Hrothgar&#x27;s thane Unferth for the fight with Grendel&#x27;s mother.

====Hadhafang====

Hadhafang is the sword invented for Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, where it was wielded by Arwen, although she is never actually seen using it in combat, as the blade&#x27;s design was for main use on horseback, and footage of Arwen at Helm&#x27;s Deep was ultimately cut. The name is derived from Tolkien&#x27;s etymological word list written in the 1930s; here Tolkien provides the word &quot;hadhathang&quot; (dissimilated: &quot;havathang, hadhafang&quot;), which he translates as &quot;throng-cleaver&quot;, though he never used this name in his writings. 

====Herugrim====

Herugrim (Old English: &quot;Fierce Sword&quot;) is the sword that belonged to Théoden.

====Narsil / Andúril====

Narsil (Quenya: roughly, &quot;Red and White Flame&quot;) is a sword in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, influenced by the legendary Arthurian sword Excalibur and by Sigurd&#x27;s sword Gram, as described in the Old Norse &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. The sword was forged during the First Age by the Dwarf Telchar of Nogrod, a famous weaponsmith and artificer who also made the knife Angrist (which cut a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth) and the Helm of Hador (later used by Túrin Turambar). By the end of the Second Age Narsil was borne by Elendil; during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men it was broken in two pieces in the war against Sauron. Isildur used the hilt-shard to cut the One Ring from Sauron&#x27;s hand. The two shards, acquiring the additional name the Sword that was Broken, remained an heirloom of Isildur&#x27;s heirs throughout the Third Age, and were thus inherited by Aragorn. Elvish smiths re-forged the sword for Aragorn before the Fellowship of the Ring began their quest; Aragorn renamed it Andúril (Quenya: &quot;Flame of the West&quot;). The reforged Andúril is described as very bright, shining red and white with the light of the sun and moon. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; further states that the original Narsil already shone in such a manner, but its light was extinguished when it was broken. The reforged blade had &quot;a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes&quot;.

====Orcrist====

Orcrist (Sindarin: Goblin-cleaver), a sword in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. was originally forged in Gondolin and was nicknamed &quot;Biter&quot; by the goblins of the Misty Mountains. After finding it in a troll-hoard, Thorin Oakenshield carries the sword through the Misty Mountains and Mirkwood before being taken prisoner by the Elves; it was laid on his tomb after his death in the Battle of Five Armies. It is the mate of Glamdring.

====Ringil====

Ringil (Sindarin: &quot;Cold-Star / Cold-Spark&quot;) is a sword wielded by Fingolfin in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;. It bit with chilling cold, and glittered like ice with a pale light. This was the sword with which Fingolfin wounded Morgoth seven times, causing the first dark lord to limp forever afterward.

In Tolkien&#x27;s early writings, Ringil was the name of one of the two pillars supporting the Two Lamps of primeval Middle-earth.

====Sting====

Sting is a large Elvish dagger in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It functioned well as a sword for the hobbits Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. Bilbo named the weapon after using it to fend off the giant spiders in Mirkwood forest, then later passed it on to Frodo to use in his quest to destroy the One Ring. Sting glows blue when orcs are nearby, as in Moria. In Europe, bilbo blades were exceptionally fine swords, named after the city of Bilbao which made them. It is possible that Tolkien connected Bilbo&#x27;s name with his acquisition of this weapon.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film adaptations, Sting is depicted as leaf-shaped, with gentle curving edges. Engraved on the blade and cross-guard are letters in Sindarin that read phonetically, &quot;Maegnas aen estar nin dagnir in yngyl im&quot;. Translated into English, they read, &quot;&quot;Maegnas&quot; is my name, I am the spider&#x27;s bane.&quot; According to the Appendix of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the element &quot;maeg&quot; in Sindarin means &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;piercing&quot;. The film version of Sting is long (24 while in scabbard) and wide at the hilt. Its scabbard is made of brown leather and reinforced with metal.

===Named bows and arrows===

====Belthronding====

Belthronding (Sindarin/Ilkorin: &quot;Intractable Bow&quot;) is the bow wielded by Beleg Cúthalion (Strongbow) in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;.

====Black arrow====

The black arrow was used in Esgaroth by Bard the Bowman; he mentions that it has been used many times, always successfully, and always recovered. An heirloom from many generations of Bard&#x27;s family, that he believed had been made in the forges of the King under the Mountain; Bard recites its history, urges it to &quot;go now and speed well&quot;, and shoots Smaug. It was lost with the Dragon&#x27;s corpse in the Long Lake.
====Dailir====

Dailir is the arrow favoured by Beleg, the great bowman of the First Age of Middle-earth. Beleg was always able to retrieve this arrow for reuse.

====Red Arrow====

The Red Arrow is a black-feathered arrow barbed with steel; its tip was painted red. It was a token used by Gondor to summon Rohan in time of dire need. In &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the Red Arrow was presented to Théoden by Hirgon with the message: &quot;...the Lord Denethor asks for all your strength and all your speed, lest Gondor should fall at last.&quot; Théoden pledged his assistance, but Hirgon was killed during the ride back to Minas Tirith, leading Denethor to believe that no help was forthcoming from Rohan. The Red Arrow has a historical antecedent in the Old English poem &quot;Elene&quot; in which Constantine the Great summoned an army of mounted Visigoths to his aid against the Huns by sending an arrow as a &quot;token of war&quot;.

===Other named weapons and armour===

====Aeglos====

Aeglos (Sindarin: &quot;Snow Point&quot;, i.e. icicle; also spelt Aiglos) is the spear wielded by the Elf-King Gil-galad. It was said that &quot;the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and Narsil, none could withstand.&quot;

====Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin====

The Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, also called the Helm of Hador, is the fabulous helmet of the lords of the House of Hador, including Húrin and Túrin. The helm was made of heavy steel, decorated with gold and runes; a gold likeness of Glaurung the Dragon was set upon its crest. It was made for the Dwarf-king by Telchar, the great Dwarf-craftsman of Nogrod. Azaghâl ruled the neighbouring city of Belegost; he gave it to Maedhros, who gave it to Fingon. Fingon then gave it to Hador, along with the lordship of Dor-lómin.

====Axe of Tuor====

The Axe of Tuor, called Dramborleg (Gnomish: &quot;Thudder-Sharp&quot;) in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, is the great axe belonging to Tuor, son of Huor in &quot;Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth&quot; that left wounds like &quot;both a heavy dint as of a club and cleft as a sword&quot;. It was later held by the Kings of Numenor, until lost in the downfall.

====Durin&#x27;s Axe====

Durin&#x27;s Axe was part of the regalia and weaponry of the Dwarf-kings of Khazad-dûm. Some years before the War of the Ring, Balin attempted to recolonize Khazad-dûm (by then called Moria), and the early records of the colony mention Durin&#x27;s Axe, indicating it was sought for or even found.

====Grond====

Grond (Sindarin: &quot;Club&quot;) is the mace of Morgoth used against Fingolfin in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as well as a battering ram in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, used to assault the Great Gate of Minas Tirith. Grond the battering ram was in-universe named after Morgoth&#x27;s mace: &quot;Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old.&quot; 

== Film prop construction ==

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, &quot;hero&quot; weapons, used for &quot;beauty&quot; shots such as close-ups, were made from high-quality materials: sword blades from heat-treated spring steel; sword hilts from cast bronze or forged and ground steel. &quot;Stunt&quot; swords, used in combat scenes, were made with soft aluminium blades and urethane grips. &quot;Extras&quot; swords were cast entirely from urethane, in one piece. Bows were made of urethane with an inner armature of spring steel. Legolas&#x27;s arrows were all-digital, so the actor simply mimed shooting each arrow.

<text>Bantry Bay () is a bay located in County Cork, Ireland. The bay runs approximately from northeast to southwest into the Atlantic Ocean. It is approximately 3-to-4 km (1.8-to-2.5 miles) wide at the head and wide at the entrance.

==Geographic features==
Bantry Bay is a ria, a bay formed from a drowned river valley as a result of a relative rise in sea level. The bay is a deep (approx 40 metres in the middle) and large natural bay, with one of the longest inlets in southwest Ireland, bordered on the north by Beara Peninsula, which separates Bantry Bay from Kenmare Bay. The southern boundary is Sheep&#x27;s Head Peninsula, separating Bantry Bay from Dunmanus Bay. The main islands in the bay are Bere Island and Whiddy Island. Bere Island is located near the entrance to the bay. On the north side of the island is Berehaven Harbour and Castletown Bearhaven port. The town of Rerrin is the largest settlement on the island. The village of Ballynakilla is also located there. 

Whiddy Island is at the head of the bay near the south shore. It is the main petroleum terminus for Ireland, the harbour ideally suited for large oceangoing tankers. A Single Point Mooring (SPM) at the Whiddy Island oil terminal is operated by Zenith Energy, Ltd. Bantry Bay was featured during a famous Gulf Oil commercial showing the supertanker &quot;Universe Kuwait&quot; that aired during the time of the Apollo Moon landing in 1969. 

Towns and villages around the bay include: Adrigole, Bantry, Ballylickey, Cahermore, Cappanolsha, Castletownbere (Castletown Bearhaven), Donemark, Foilakill, Gerahies, and Glengarriff. Main routes that follow parts of the bay include the R572 (part of the &quot;Ring of Beara&quot;) and the N71. The Bantry Bay Golf Club is at the head of the bay, across from Whiddy Island. The O&#x27;Sullivan Beara Dunboy Castle is just across from Bere Island in Berehaven Harbour. &quot;Copper John&quot; Puxley&#x27;s Manor is in Dunboy. Daphne du Maurier’s novel &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; is based on the Puxley family&#x27;s involvement in the area&#x27;s tin and copper mining industry.

==History==
===Battle of Bantry Bay===

The Battle of Bantry Bay occurred in 1689, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, between English and French fleets.

===Rebellion of 1798===
The town of Bantry, at the head of the bay, is associated with the Irish Rebellion of 1798 through an earlier attempt, led by Irish revolutionary Wolfe Tone, to launch a rebellion there in December 1796. A French fleet, consisting of 43 ships carrying 15,000 troops, had divided mid-Atlantic into smaller groups to avoid interception by the Royal Navy and planned to reform at Bantry Bay. The bulk of the fleet arrived successfully but several ships, including the flagship &quot;Fraternité&quot; carrying General Hoche, were delayed. While awaiting their arrival, bad weather intervened and the lack of leadership, together with uneasiness at the prospect of being trapped, forced the decision to return to France. Tone wrote of the expedition in his diary, saying that &quot;We were close enough to toss a biscuit ashore in Ahabeg in Berehaven Harbour.&quot; The square in Bantry is today named after Wolfe Tone.

===Bantry Longboat/Bere Island Longboat===
A longboat used in a French scouting expedition landed in Bere Island and lay in Berehaven harbour for 102 years. It was taken to Bantry House in 1898, moved from Bantry House to Dublin in 1944 and was presented to the National Museum of Ireland. In 1977, it was lent to the Maritime Institute of Ireland who exhibited it at the National Maritime Museum of Ireland, Dún Laoghaire, until 2003. A scale model is now displayed. The longboat was restored at the Liverpool Museum at a cost of €50,000 and is on display in the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks, as part of the &quot;Soldiers and Chiefs&quot; exhibition

===Betelgeuse disaster===
On 8 January 1979, 50 people were killed when a French oil tanker, the &quot;Betelgeuse&quot;, was offloading at Whiddy Island when it caught fire, exploded, and broke into three pieces. The bay has had numerous shipwrecks over the years. In 1981, while cleanup efforts using sonar sweeps for the &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; were under way, the wreck of the French frigate &quot;La Surveillante&quot;, which had been scuttled during a storm north of Whiddy Island on 2 January 1797, was found.

==Rescue services==
Bantry Inshore Search and Rescue Association (BISRA) provides an emergency lifeboat service to the Bantry Harbour community. Equipped with a high speed rescue RIB BISRA is a declared resource of the Irish Coastguard.

<doc id="1053381" wikidata="Q1048506" url="?curid=1053381" title="River Nore">
<text>The River Nore ( ) is one of the principal rivers (along with the River Suir and River Barrow) in the South-East Region of Ireland. The river drains approximately of Leinster and Munster, that encompasses parts of three counties (Tipperary, Laois, Kilkenny). Along with the River Suir and River Barrow, it is one of the constituent rivers of the group known as the Three Sisters.

Starting in the Devil&#x27;s Bit Mountain, County Tipperary, the river flows generally southeast, and then south, before its confluence with the River Barrow at Ringwood, and the Barrow railway bridge at Drumdowney, County Kilkenny, which empties into the Celtic Sea at Waterford Harbour, Waterford.

The long term average flow rate of the River Nore is 42.9 cubic metres per second (m3/s) The river is home to the only known extant population of the critically endangered Nore freshwater pearl mussel, and much of its length is listed as a Special Area of Conservation.

==Name==
Nore is an anglicisation of the river&#x27;s Old Irish name &quot;An Eoir&quot;; the modern Irish name is &quot;An Fheoir&quot;. As such, the name is believed to be derived, etymologically, from Old Irish : &quot;green bank or shoreland.&quot; Modern Irish means &quot;green bank, edge or shore of sea, lake or river&quot;. In regard to &quot;An Fheoir, the Nore (g. -e, al. An Eoir); al. Feor, cf. feora&quot;, &quot;Dinneen&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1927) states: &quot;Feoir g. -e, and Feorach, f. border, brim, edge; a stream or rivulet.”

The &quot;Martyrology of Oengus the Culdee&quot; (&quot;Félire Óengusso Céli Dé&quot;), published some time before the year 824, mentions the river: &quot;the cold-pure Eoire .&quot; A Middle Irish reference, from before 1420, refers to the &quot;Fiond-chlár fairsing na Feoire&quot; &quot;fair wide plain of the Feoir&quot;.

== Course ==

The Nore rises on the eastern slopes of the Devil&#x27;s Bit Mountain in the townland of Borrisnoe, County Tipperary. It then flows south-eastwards to County Laois and County Kilkenny before joining the River Barrow just north of New Ross near the Barrow Bridge. The river passes near Durrow, County Laois then through Ballyragget, the city of Kilkenny and then the villages of Bennettsbridge and Thomastown. Further south, it forms a picturesque V-shaped river valley, particularly notable near the village of Inistioge, the tidal limit. Major tributaries of the Nore include the Dinan, the Breagagh at Kilkenny City, the King&#x27;s River, the Little Arrigle and the Black Water.

== Geology and morphology ==
The Nore rises on a sandstone base but the catchment soon turns to limestone and remains so to the sea. The countryside is one of mixed farming, with some tillage, quite a bit of pasture and dairying and some bloodstock. The river has a fairly steep gradient but the flow is checked by innumerable weirs and it is probably true to say that shallow glides are the pre-dominant feature.

== History ==

In pre-Famine years, there were many water-powered industries in the Nore valley, particularly in the ten-mile (16 km) stretch between Kilkenny City and Thomastown, including breweries, woolen mills, sawmills, marble works, distillaries and grain mills. Flax and linen were produced just north of Kilkenny City.

== Recreation ==
Kilkenny fishing club has extensive fishing rights on the River Nore and its tributary, the River Dinan. Popular with anglers, it holds brown trout and salmon.

Some of these weirs along the river have good playboating qualities. The river is long and mostly flat and dotted with weirs at most of the villages it passes through.

Salmon runs on the river Nore were interrupted in 2005 and 2006 by a flood relief scheme in Kilkenny city carried out by the Office of Public Works. Initially budgeted at €13.1 million, the scheme was delivered at a cost in excess of €48 million and did not contain suitable fish passes. This oversight has since been rectified at additional expense and salmon can now ascend the river upstream of Kilkenny city.

<text>Mark Anthony Pembridge (born 29 November 1970) is a Welsh retired footballer who played as a midfielder, and a current coach at the academy for Fulham.

He played 333 matches in England&#x27;s top division for Luton Town, Sheffield Wednesday, Everton and Fulham, scoring 25 goals. He also played for Derby County, and spent the 1998–99 season at Benfica in Portugal.

Pembridge won 54 caps for Wales, and scored six goals, in a 13-year international career.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Pembridge began his career at Luton Town in the First Division. He joined as a trainee in 1989.

===Derby County===
Having established as a left midfielder, 21-year old Pembridge was signed for second-tier Derby County by manager Arthur Cox in the summer of 1992 for a fee of £1.25 million. He racked up 140 appearances and netted 37 goals over his time with Derby and played at Wembley twice – once in a 3–1 defeat to Cremonese in 1993 and then in a 2–1 defeat to Leicester City in the 1994 Football League First Division play-off final. Pembridge left to move up a division to Premier League Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of £900,000 in the summer of 1995.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Pembridge played for Wednesday in the Premier League until 1998, when he left for Portuguese side Benfica on a free transfer after Wednesday finished 16th in the season.

===Everton===
Pembridge struggled to settle in Portugal and returned to England after one season, signing a contract with top-flight side Everton for £800,000. Pembridge had a good first two seasons at Everton, with his tenacious approach and thrusting runs from deep establishing the Welshman as an integral part of Everton&#x27;s squad, thus securing him an excellent rapport with the Goodison Park faithful. However, testing times were around the corner for Pembridge, with a persistent calf injury meaning he only played 13 games in the 2001–02 season. The injury still bothered him during the 2002–03 season, but Pembridge still played a part in a dramatic season, which ended with Everton failing to qualify for a UEFA Cup place.

===Fulham===
Pembridge looked set to stay at Everton for the 2003–04 campaign, but on the transfer deadline day in August 2003, he was signed by Fulham for £750,000 after four years at Everton. He had an injury-free first season at Fulham, during which he scored his first goal for the club against rivals Chelsea, and this was followed by a successful second season in which he played 37 games overall, scoring once in the League Cup against Birmingham. Pembridge missed most of Fulham&#x27;s 2005–06 season through injury, and only played 5 games. Manager Chris Coleman deemed him surplus to requirements, and he did not play a single game during the 2006–07 season. He was released by new manager Lawrie Sanchez at the end of the season. After this, Pembridge announced he was retiring. Reflecting on his retirement, Pembridge quoted:

==International career==
Pembridge was called up to play for Wales while at Luton in 1991. He had several highlights while playing for Wales, including scoring arguably his best career goal against Ukraine in 2001 and reaching the qualifying playoffs for Euro 2004, despite narrowly losing to Russia. Pembridge quit the national team in 2004 shortly after John Toshack was named as the new Wales manager. He announced his international retirement in 2005, ending speculation that he might return to play for Wales. He played 54 times for Wales, scoring 6 goals.

==Coaching career==
On 4 September 2007, Fulham confirmed that Pembridge had stayed on at the club as a coach for the academy. He would later become Under-15s and U16s Coordinator for the club.

He left Fulham in October 2021. On 11 May he featured as a commentator for BBC Radio Merseyside for Everton&#x27;s match against Watford

<doc id="1053385" wikidata="Q1788926" url="?curid=1053385" title="Wexford Harbour">
<text>Wexford Harbour () in County Wexford, Ireland is the natural harbour at the mouth of the River Slaney. In earlier times, the area occupied by the harbour was considerably larger than it is today, up to ten miles (16 km) wide at its widest point, with large mud flats on both sides. These were known as the North Slob and the South Slob from the Irish word &quot;slab&quot;, meaning mud. It contained several islands, among which the large island of Beggerin was known to be a safe refuge for early Christian settlements.

==History==

===Early history===
Vikings arrived from Norway in 819 AD and founded the city of Wexford calling it &quot;Waes Fjord&quot;, meaning &#x27;inlet of the mudflats&#x27;, and the modern name has evolved from this. Over the course of about 300 years, the Norse settled in Wexford, intermarried with the local population and gradually converted to Christianity. They forged temporary alliances with Irish kings, sometimes fighting with other Norse towns; at other times, such as in 933 and 1161 they were attacked by the Irish. The Norse remained in control until 1169 AD when Wexford was attacked by a superior force of Norman and Irish soldiers. There was a short battle after which the Hiberno-Norse withdrew within the walls leaving their ships unprotected. These were set on fire by the attackers - this may have been the origin of the Wexford Town crest, the three burning ships.

===The 17th century===
Wexford became a major maritime port exporting fish, cloth, wool and hides. It was Ireland&#x27;s leading fishing port in the 15th and 16th century exporting mainly to ports along the west coast of England and Wales. In 1642, the Dublin government in a dispatch from London described Wexford as &quot;a place plentiful in ships and seamen, and where the rebels have set up Spanish colours on their walls in defiance of the kings and kingdom of England, and have gotten in from foreign parts great stores of arms and ammunition&quot;. This was only one year after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 when Flemish mariners were encouraged to use Wexford Harbour to attack British ships passing along the Irish Sea from ports Whitehaven to Bristol and even in the English Channel. Wexford Harbour was a marvellous base for operations; it was strategically located at the junction of the Irish Sea, the Western Approaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. The difficult navigation of the harbour gave security to the locals, as larger attacking ships could not enter. The sandbanks and narrow channels did not present much difficulty to the Dunkirk frigates or the local shallow draft cargo ships.

===Cromwell===
By the mid-1640s, the privateering community of Irish, Flemish and French based in Wexford had a fleet of 200 cargo ships and 21 frigates whose purpose was to attack English ships between Biscay and the Baltic. Within a few years this fleet had doubled. However, it could not last. In 1649, a parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell landed in Dublin and after some months set out to conquer Wexford. An army of 7,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 cavalry camped north of the town and sent a detachment to capture Rosslare fort at the mouth of the harbour. This enabled Cromwell&#x27;s fleet to enter the harbour unopposed. The army moved to south of the town and bombarded Wexford Castle. Initially, Cromwell issued a summons to surrender, offering lenient terms in the hope that he could secure Wexford intact and use it as winter quarters for his troops. The mayor, aldermen and many citizens of Wexford were prepared to surrender but the military commander played for time. Cromwell lost patience and talks broke down. The bombardment continued and after a week or so Cromwell&#x27;s troops breached the defences when the commander of the castle surrendered. The castle guns were turned on the town and Cromwell&#x27;s troops launched an immediate attack on the town&#x27;s defenders.

Irish troops made a stand in the market square, but they were quickly overwhelmed. Cromwell and his officers made no attempt to restrain their soldiers, who slaughtered the Wexford defenders and plundered the town. Hundreds of civilians were shot or drowned as they tried to escape the carnage by fleeing across the River Slaney. The Irish privateering fleet was finally broken up. Afterwards, Cromwell expressed no remorse for the massacre of civilians at Wexford in his subsequent report to Parliament. He regarded it as a further judgement upon the perpetrators of the Catholic uprising of 1641 and also upon the pirates who had operated out of Wexford harbour. His principal regret was that the town was so badly damaged during the sack that it was no longer suitable as winter quarters.

===Act of Union===
In 1764 the historian Amyas Griffith wrote that Wexford&#x27;s chief export was corn (2 million barrels per year), herrings, beer, beef, hides, tallow, butter etc. and they trade to all parts of the globe but in particular to Liverpool, Barbados, Dublin, Norway and Bordeaux. The town continued to experience expansion and economic growth and in 1772 two important bodies were set up - the Quay Corporation with full responsibility for shipping, quays and harbour and the Bridge Corporation to build two bridges across the Slaney at Wexford and Ferrycarrig. By 1788, Wexford, with 44 cargo ships and 200 herring boats was the sixth busiest port in Ireland. However the dangerous state of the harbour was a major impediment to trade. A new body - The Corporation for the Improvement of the Bar, Town &amp; Harbour of Wexford was set up to improve and enhance the channel and to build quays, wharves and docks.

The Irish Rebellion of 1798 resulted in the hurried passing of the Act of Union in 1800. This created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Ireland was ruled solely through the British Parliament at Westminster. From then until Ireland achieved independence, all major decisions regarding Wexford Harbour were taken by Westminster. Unfortunately, this did not work to the advantage of the harbour and the improvement of its navigation. The pity was that those interested in improving the harbour, linked their proposed improvements with land reclamation; a linkage that would ultimately help to destroy access to Wexford by all but shallow draft vessels.

In 1832, the Ballast Bank was constructed to facilitate the loading and unloading of ballast from ships visiting the harbour. It is now a protected structure.

A lifeboat was stationed on Rosslare Point from 1838. It was originally crewed by the Coastguard at the fort but a permanent crew was later provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. After severe storms between 27 December 1924 and 13 January 1925 damaged Rosslare Point, the lifeboat was moved to Wexford until Rosslare Harbour Lifeboat Station was reopened in 1927. An inshore lifeboat station was established in Wexford in 2002.

===Destruction of the harbour by drainage works===

In the 19th century, dykes were built and pumping systems installed to drain the slobs, producing fine agricultural land below sea level in polders similar to those in the Netherlands. The size of the harbour was reduced considerably. What was left was mostly shallow and up to today suffers from serious silt problems. The tides and currents of the river frequently shift mud and sand in the harbour. Islands of sand can appear and then disappear over the course of a few weeks, particularly at the mouth of the harbour. As a result, the harbour is not suitable for large ships and is used mainly by mussel dredgers and pleasure craft.

=== World War I ===

During World War I the US Navy operated a naval air station, known as U.S. Naval Air Station Wexford, at Ferrybank on the eastern side of the harbour.

==Sailing directions==
Entry for sailors unfamiliar with the harbour is not straightforward. It is best within two hours either side of high water and safest for boats drawing less than 1.5 metres (5 feet). In strong winds between SE and NE direction, the sea breaks on the bar. Entry is then hazardous and should not be attempted.

<text>Edward Carson Sargent (April 11, 1915 – January 28, 1998) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1963 to 1987 who represented the central Ontario riding of Grey North and Grey-Bruce.

==Background==
Sargent was born in Port Dover, and educated in Owen Sound. He was a publisher and sales executive, serving as president of Owen Sound Herald Press Ltd., Sargent Reality Co. Ltd. and Eddie Sargent Promotions Ltd. He married Roma McLean in 1940 and together they raised three daughters. His wife died of cancer in 1981.

==Politics==
He campaigned for the Ontario legislature in the 1948 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative Mac Phillips by 383 votes in Grey North. He became mayor of Owen Sound in the same year, and held this position until 1963. In 1951, he served as president of the Ontario Mayors and Reeves Association.

Sargent campaigned for the legislature a second time in the 1955 provincial election, and again lost to Phillips. He also campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal candidate in the 1957 federal election, and lost in Grey North to Progressive Conservative candidate Percy Verner Noble.

Mac Phillips did not contest the 1963 provincial election, and Sargent was elected over new Progressive Conservative candidate William Forsyth by 31 votes. He campaigned for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1964, and finished sixth out of seven candidates. The winner was Andrew Thompson, later a Canadian Senator. Sargent was re-elected in the elections of 1967, 1971, 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1985 in the riding of Grey-Bruce.

Following the 1985 election, the Liberal Party ended forty-two years of Progressive Conservative rule in Ontario by forming a minority government with outside support from the New Democratic Party. After serving on the opposition benches for twenty-two years, Sargent was able to end his career on the government side. He served as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Tourism and Recreation, and did not seek re-election in 1987.

==Later life==
In recognition of his public service, a 29 km. road in Owen Sound was renamed the Eddie Sargent Parkway. Sargent was married to Roma McLean (1918–1981) and he is buried in the Greenwood Cemetery, Owen Sound, Ontario. His daughter, Patti Belle Sargent wrote a book detailing the life and exploits of Eddie Sargent entitled &quot;Roses in December: A Biography of Eddie Sargent&quot;.

<text>100 King Street, formerly the Midland Bank, is a former bank premises on King Street in Manchester, England. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1928 and constructed in 1933–35. It is Lutyens&#x27; major work in Manchester and was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1974.

==Architecture==
A castle-like Art Deco building, surrounded by roads on all four sides, the architects for the former bank were Lutyens in collaboration with Whinney, Son &amp; Austen Hall and it was built between 1933 and 1935 by J. Gerrard &amp; Sons of Swinton and features carvings by the local sculptor John Ashton Floyd. It is constructed of Portland stone around a steel frame. Its neoclassical design is unusual for Manchester; the style perhaps more suited to the architecture of Liverpool, as most of Manchester&#x27;s buildings are Neogothic.

&quot;The proportions are ingeniously calculated, as Lutyens ... adored to do. The top stage is two-thirds of the stage from the obelisks to the next set-back, and that middle stage is two-thirds of the bottom stage.&quot; It is sometimes known as &quot;The King of King Street&quot; because of its distinct structure and height.

From 1912, Lutyens laid out New Delhi as the new capital of India. He devised his own Delhi Order of classical architecture there, with small bells hanging from the capitals of the columns, and subsequently made use of this order in his design for the bank.

==History==

The bank was renamed HSBC Bank after HSBC acquired the Midland Bank in the 1990s. It closed on 6 June 2008 when HSBC relocated to St Ann&#x27;s Square. The building was subsequently refurbished to provide office space and was placed on the office rental market in March 2010. Jamie Oliver opened an Italian restaurant in the former banking hall in 2011, which closed in 2019 after the company went into administration. A plan to convert the upper floors of the building into a boutique hotel was announced in 2013.

In April 2015, the Hotel Gotham opened on the upper floors of the building.

In August 2022, Gordon Ramsay announced that he planned to open a restaurant in the unit formerly occupied by Jamie&#x27;s Italian. &#x27;Lucky Cat Manchester&#x27;, Ramsey&#x27;s Tokyo-themed restaurant, opened at the site on 1 June 2023. The restaurant spans three floors and features a private dining room situated in the underground bank vault.

<doc id="1053397" wikidata="Q699247" url="?curid=1053397" title="Battle of Jasmund (1864)">
<text>The naval Battle of Jasmund (also known as the &quot;Battle of Rügen&quot;) took place between elements of the Danish and Prussian navies on 17 March 1864 during the Second Schleswig War. The action took place east of the Jasmund peninsula on the Prussian island of Rügen, during a Prussian attempt to weaken the Danish blockade in the Baltic Sea. The Prussian squadron, commanded by Eduard von Jachmann, sortied with a screw frigate, a screw corvette, a paddle steamer, and six gunboats to attack the Danish squadron blockading the eastern Prussian coast. The Danish force was commanded by Edvard van Dockum, and it consisted of one screw frigate, one ship of the line, and two steam corvettes. In an action lasting two hours, the superior Danish squadron forced the Prussians to withdraw, with both sides suffering damage and light casualties. The Danish victory was compounded by the arrival of further warships after the battle, which cemented the blockade. The outcome of the battle, and the naval war in the Baltic as a whole, was irrelevant to the outcome of the war, however, as the Prussian and Austrian armies decisively defeated the Danes on land, forcing them to surrender.

== Background ==
In late 1863, as Prussia began to prepare to launch the Second Schleswig War, vessels of the Prussian Navy were relocated. The screw frigate and the screw corvette were transferred from Danzig to Swinemünde, which would allow them to cooperate with the gunboats based in Stralsund. By the time Prussia and the Austrian Empire declared war on 1 February 1864, the ships&#x27; crews were still performing maintenance on their engines, and the winter ice had yet to recede far enough to allow offensive operations. The Danish fleet, on the other hand, immediately proclaimed a blockade of the Prussian coast. As most of the Prussian fleet was in the Baltic Sea, the Danes could easily enforce a blockade of the German North Sea ports, allowing most of their fleet to be concentrated in the Baltic.
The Danish fleet in the Baltic, commanded by Rear Admiral Edvard van Dockum, was far superior in size and power to the Prussian fleet and it had no trouble enforcing the blockade. The ship of the line and five smaller vessels were sent to blockade Swinemünde and Stettin, the ironclad warship and five unarmored ships blockaded Danzig. Several merchant vessels were seized in February and March, prompting Admiral Prince Adalbert of Prussia, the commander of the Prussian Navy, to begin plans for an operation against the blockade, to be led by Captain Eduard von Jachmann, who during the war became the squadron commander in charge of operations.

By mid-March, the Prussian ships were ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a reconnaissance of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum&#x27;s squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. &quot;Arcona&quot; and &quot;Nymphe&quot; patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but there was not enough time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.

== The battle ==
On the morning of 17 March, Prince Adalbert sent Jachmann&#x27;s squadron to attack the Danish blockade. The ships sortied from the mouth of the Oder at 07:30 and initially steamed east, but could not locate any Danish warships. They turned west and, as they approached the island of Greifswalder Oie, lookouts aboard the ships spotted smoke to the northwest at about 13:15. The Prussians continued on toward the island of Rügen; off the Jasmund peninsula, Jachmann&#x27;s ships encountered Dockum&#x27;s squadron. There, with &quot;Arcona&quot; and &quot;Nymphe&quot; in the lead, Jachmann turned to engage the Danes; &quot;Loreley&quot; increased speed to join the two corvettes while Jachmann sent the gunboats to the coast of Rügen, where they could be used to cover his withdrawal. From further north, Dockum was awaiting the arrival of the steam frigate .

At 14:30, &quot;Arcona&quot; opened fire, targeting the frigate ; a few minutes later, after &quot;Sjælland&quot; closed to , Dockum turned his flagship to starboard and began firing broadsides at &quot;Arcona&quot;. Jachmann turned &quot;Arcona&quot; to starboard as well, having realized the strength of the Danish squadron. He failed to inform the captains of &quot;Nymphe&quot; and &quot;Loreley&quot; of his decision to withdraw, and they continued to steam east for several minutes before they conformed to his maneuver. At this time, Dockum shifted fire to &quot;Nymphe&quot; and scored several hits, including damage to her funnel that reduced her speed temporarily. Dockum attempted to overtake and cut off &quot;Nymphe&quot; and &quot;Loreley&quot; from &quot;Arcona&quot;, but &quot;Nymphe&quot;″s crew was able to quickly repair the damage she had sustained, allowing her to increase speed, though she continued to take hits.

After 15:00, &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; arrived from the north and, as she steamed south to join Dockum&#x27;s squadron, she came under long-range fire from the Prussian gunboats at 15:40. As she continued south, she fired broadsides at the gunboats but otherwise ignored them, with neither side scoring any hits. The gunboats thereafter withdrew, although broke down and required a tow back to Stralsund. In the meantime, &quot;Loreley&quot; and &quot;Nymphe&quot; came under heavy fire from the pursuing Danish squadron; at 16:00 &quot;Loreley&quot; broke off to the west toward Stralsund and Dockum allowed her to leave, preferring to continue after Jachmann&#x27;s corvettes. Both sides continue to score hits on each other until they checked fire at around 16:45 as the range grew too far. By 18:00, Dockum ended the chase and steamed off to the east, allowing Jachmann to return to Swinemünde.

==Aftermath==

Danish losses were six killed and sixteen wounded, all on the frigate &quot;Sjælland&quot;. The Prussian ships suffered lighter casualties; three men were killed aboard &quot;Arcona&quot;, and three more were wounded. Two men were killed and four were injured aboard &quot;Nymphe&quot;, and just a single man was wounded aboard &quot;Loreley&quot;. &quot;Nymphe&quot; was the most damaged vessel of either side, having been hit nineteen times in her hull, four times on her superstructure, and fifty times on her masts and rigging. On the night of 17 March, the screw frigate joined the Danish blockade force, and she was fast enough to catch Jachmann&#x27;s corvettes. Danish naval supremacy in the Baltic was further cemented with the arrival on 30 March of &quot;Dannebrog&quot;, which was impervious to any weapon the Prussians then possessed. As a result, the Prussian fleet remained in port for the remainder of the war; the only events of note were a pair of sorties by the aviso in April, though the Prussian ship did not encounter any Danish vessels on either operation. Jasmund proved to be the only naval action of consequence in the Baltic.

Despite having been forced to flee, Jachmann was promoted to the rank of rear admiral for his actions during the battle. The Prussians made several further patrols in the Baltic, but refused to seek a pitched engagement with the far superior Danish fleet. Instead, the Second Schleswig War was decided on land. Additionally, the arrival of an Austrian squadron in the North Sea allowed the Austrians and Prussians to break the Danish blockade of the North Sea coastal ports at the Battle of Heligoland on 9 May. The Austrians, fearing that a more aggressive operation to defeat the Danish fleet in the Baltic would provoke the British, kept their squadron in the North Sea for the remainder of the war. On 9 May, the two sides signed an armistice in London that took effect three days later, temporarily ending the fighting. The armistice lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The Austrian and Prussian naval forces in the North Sea supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als in the Baltic Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second armistice on 29 June. Ultimately, Denmark sued for peace after it became clear that they had lost naval superiority and that Britain would not intervene in the conflict.

<doc id="1053404" wikidata="Q967934" url="?curid=1053404" title="Trebbiano">
<text>Trebbiano is an Italian wine grape, one of the most widely planted grape varieties in the world. It gives good yields, but tends to yield undistinguished wine. It can be fresh and fruity, but does not keep long. Also known as ugni blanc, it has many other names reflecting a family of local subtypes, particularly in Italy and France. Its high acidity makes it important in Cognac and Armagnac productions.

==History==
Trebbiano may have originated in the Eastern Mediterranean, and was known in Italy in Roman times. A subtype was recognized in Bologna in the thirteenth century, and as Ugni blanc made its way to France, possibly during the Papal retreat to Avignon in the fourteenth century.

An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Garganega on the one hand and Trebbiano and several other grape varieties on the other hand. It is therefore possible that Garganega is one of the parents of Trebbiano; however, since the parents of Garganega have not been identified, the exact nature of the relationship could not be conclusively established. Also, in the early 21st century, DNA analysis has suggested that there may be a close genetic relationship between Trebbiano and the Emilia-Romagna wine grape Alionza.

During a series of trials between 1924 and 1930, Trebbiano was crossed with Gewürztraminer to create the pink-skinned Italian wine grape variety Manzoni rosa. 

==Distribution and wines==

===Argentina===
Like many Italian grapes, Trebbiano came to Argentina with Italian immigrants.

===Australia===
&quot;White Hermitage&quot; came to Australia with James Busby in 1832. The major plantings are in New South Wales and South Australia, where it is mostly used for brandy and for blending with other grapes in table wine.

===Bulgaria===
It is known as &#x27;Thalia&#x27; in both Bulgaria and Portugal.

===France===
&#x27;Ugni blanc&#x27; is the most widely planted white grape of France, being found particularly along the Provençal coast, in the Gironde and Charente. It is also known as &#x27;Clairette Ronde&#x27;, &#x27;Clairette de Vence&#x27;, &#x27;Queue de Renard&#x27;, and in Corsica as &#x27;Rossola&#x27;.

Under the name &#x27;St. Émilion,&#x27; Trebbiano is important in brandy production, being the most common grape variety in Cognac and Armagnac. In the Armagnac / Côtes de Gascogne area it is also used in the white Floc de Gascogne.

===Italy===

The Trebbiano family account for around a third of all white wine in Italy. It is mentioned in more than 80 of Italy&#x27;s DOCs (&quot;Controlled origin denominations&quot;), although it has just seven of its own : Trebbiano d&#x27;Abruzzo DOC, Trebbiano di Aprilia, Trebbiano di Arborea, Trebbiano di Capriano del Colle, Trebbiano di Romagna and Trebbiano Val Trebbia dei Colli Piacentini and Trebbiano di Soave.

Perhaps the most successful Trebbiano-based blend are the Orvieto whites of Umbria, which use a local clone called Procanico.

Trebbiano is also used to produce balsamic vinegar.

Trebbiano is one of the most commonly cultivated vines in Atri, modern name of Hatria.

===Portugal===
As in Bulgaria, the variety is known as &#x27;Thalia&#x27; in Portugal.

===United States===
Italian immigrants brought Trebbiano to California, but is seldom seen as a single variety table wine.

==Vine and viticulture==
The vine is vigorous and high-yielding, with long cylindrical bunches of tough-skinned berries that yield acidic yellow juice.

==Synonyms==
Albano, Albana secco, Biancone, Blanc Auba, Blanc De Cadillac, Blancoun, Bobiano, Bonebeou, Branquinha, Brocanico, Bubbiano, Buriano, Buzzetto, Cadillac, Cadillate, Castelli, Castelli Romani, Castillone, Chator, Clairette D&#x27;Afrique, Clairette De Vence, Clairette Ronde, Engana Rapazes, Espadeiro branco, Falanchina, Greco, Gredelin, Hermitage White, Juni Blan, Lugana, Malvasia Fina, Muscadet Aigre, Padeiro branco, Perugino, Procanico, Procanico Dell Isola D Elba, Procanico Portoferraio, Queue De Renard, Romani, Rossan De Nice, Rossetto, Rossola, Rossula, Roussan, Roussea, Rusciola, Saint Emilion, Saint Emilion Des Charentes, Santoro, Shiraz White, Spoletino, Talia, Trebbianello, Trebbiano, Trebbiano Della Fiamma, Trebbiano Di Cesena, Trebbiano Di Empoli, Trebbiano Di Lucca, Trebbiano Di Tortona, Trebbiano Fiorentino, Trebbiano Toscano, Trebbianone, Tribbiano, Tribbiano Forte, Turbiano, Ugni blanc, Bouan, Beau, Thalia, Trebbiano Romagnolo, Trebbiano Gallo and Trebbiano d&#x27;Abruzzo.

Trebbiano shares at least three synonyms with the Spanish wine grape Viura including Queue de Renard, Rossan, Ugni blanc and the similarly spelled Gredelín/Gredelin.

<doc id="1053409" wikidata="Q1780216" url="?curid=1053409" title="Angolan War of Independence">
<text>The Angolan War of Independence (; 1961–1974), known as the Armed Struggle of National Liberation (Portuguese: &quot;Luta Armada de Libertação Nacional&quot;) in Angola, was a war of independence fought between the Angolan nationalist forces of the MPLA, UNITA and FNLA, and Portugal. It began as an uprising by Angolans against the Portuguese imposition of forced cultivation of only cotton as a commodity crop. As the resistance spread against colonial authorities, multiple factions developed that struggled for control of Portugal&#x27;s overseas province of Angola. There were three nationalist movements and also a separatist movement. 

The war ended when a peaceful coup in Lisbon in April 1974 overthrew Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Estado Novo&quot; dictatorship. The new regime immediately stopped all military action in the African colonies, declaring its intention to grant them independence without delay.

The conflict is usually approached as a branch or a theater of the wider Portuguese Colonial War. This included the independence wars of Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique.

The Angolans waged a guerrilla war, to which the Portuguese army and security forces conducted a counter-insurgency campaign against armed groups, who were mostly dispersed across sparsely populated areas of the vast Angolan countryside. Many atrocities were committed by all forces involved in the conflict.

After the Portuguese withdrew, an armed conflict broke out in Angola among the nationalist movements. The war formally came to an end in January 1975 when the Portuguese government, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) signed the Alvor Agreement. Informally, the civil war resumed by May 1975, including street fighting in Luanda and the surrounding countryside.

== Background of the territory ==
In 1482, the Kingdom of Portugal&#x27;s caravels, commanded by navigator Diogo Cão, arrived in the Kingdom of Kongo. Other expeditions followed, and close relations were soon established between the two kingdoms. The Portuguese brought many technological advances including firearms, and a new religion, Christianity. In return, the King of Kongo offered slaves, ivory and minerals.

Paulo Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as . Novais occupied a strip of land with a hundred families of colonists and four hundred soldiers, and established a fortified settlement. The Portuguese crown granted Luanda the status of city in 1605. The Portuguese founded and maintained several other settlements, forts and ports, such as Benguela, a Portuguese fort from 1587, and a town from 1617.

The early period of Portuguese incursion was punctuated by a series of wars, treaties and disputes with local African rulers, particularly Nzinga Mbandi, who resisted Portugal with great determination. The conquest of the territory of contemporary Angola started only in the 19th century and was not concluded before the 1920s.

In 1834, Angola and the rest of the Portuguese overseas dominions received the status of overseas provinces of Portugal. From then on, the official position of the Portuguese authorities was always that Angola was an integral part of Portugal in the same way as were the provinces of the Metropole (European Portugal). The status of province was briefly interrupted from 1926 to 1951, when Angola was governed as a &quot;colony&quot; (itself administratively divided in several provinces), but it was recovered on 11 June 1951. The Portuguese constitutional revision of 1971 increased the autonomy of the province, which became the State of Angola.

Angola has always had very low population density. Despite having a territory larger than France and Germany combined, Angola&#x27;s population was only 5 million in 1960, of which around 180,000 were whites, 55,000 were mixed race and the rest were blacks. In the 1970s, the population had increased to 5.65 million, of which 450,000 were whites, 65,000 were mixed race and the rest were blacks. Political scientist Gerald Bender wrote &quot;... by the end of 1974 the white population of Angola would be approximately 335,000, or slightly more than half the number which has commonly been reported.&quot;

The provincial government of Angola was headed by the Governor-General, who had both executive and legislative powers, reporting to the Portuguese Government, through the Minister of the Overseas. He was assisted by a cabinet made up of a Secretary-General (who also served as his deputy) and several provincial secretaries, each managing a given portfolio. There was a Legislative Council – including both appointed and elected members – with legislative responsibilities that were gradually increased in the 1960s and the 1970s. In 1972, it was transformed in the Legislative Assembly of Angola. There was also a Council of Government, responsible for advising the Governor-General in his legislative and executive responsibilities, which included the senior public officials of the province.

Despite being responsible for the police and other civil internal security forces, the Governor-General did not have military responsibilities, which were vested in the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Angola. The Commander-in-Chief reported directly to the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. On some occasions however, the same person was appointed to fulfil both the roles of Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief, thus assuming both civil and military responsibilities.

In 1961, the local administration of Angola included the following districts: Cabinda, Congo, Luanda, Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul, Malanje, Lunda, Benguela, Huambo, Bié-Cuando-Cubango, Moxico, Moçâmedes and Huíla. In 1962, the Congo District was divided in the Zaire and Uige districts and that of Bié-Cuando-Cubando in the Bié and Cuando-Cubango districts. In 1970, the Cunene District was also created from the southern part of the Huíla District. Each was headed by a district governor, assisted by a district board. Following the Portuguese model of local government, the districts were made of municipalities () and these were subdivided in civil parishes (), each administered by local council (respectively and ). In the regions where the necessary social and economic development had not yet been achieved the municipalities and civil parishes were transitorily replaced, respectively, by administrative circles () and posts (). Each of these governed by an official appointed by the government who had wide administrative powers, performing local government, police, sanitary, economical, tributary and even judicial roles. The circle administrators and the chiefs of administrative posts directed the local native auxiliary police officers known as . In these regions, the traditional authorities – including native kings, rulers and tribal chiefs – were kept and integrated in the administrative system, serving as intermediaries between the provincial authorities and the local native populations.

===Portuguese forces===

The Portuguese forces engaged in the conflict included mainly the Armed Forces, but also the security and paramilitary forces.

====Armed Forces====
The Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola included land, naval and air forces, which came under the joint command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Angola. Until 17 June 1961, there was no appointed Commander-in-Chief, with the joint command in the early stages of the conflict exercised by the commanders of the land forces, generals (until June 1961) and Silva Freire (from June to September 1961). From then on, the role of Commander-in-Chief was performed successively by the generals (1961–1962, also serving as Governor-General), Holbeche Fino (1962–1963), Andrade e Silva (1963–1965), Soares Pereira (1965–1970), Costa Gomes (1970–1972), Luz Cunha (1972–1974) and Franco Pinheiro (1974), all of them from the Army, except Libório from the Air Force. The Commander-in-Chief served as the theatre commander and coordinated the forces of the three branches stationed in the province, with the respective branch commanders serving as assistant commanders-in-chief. During the course of the conflict, the operational role of the Commander-in-Chief and of his staff was increasingly reinforced at the expense of branch commanders. In 1968, the Military Area 1 – responsible for the Dembos rebel area – was established under the direct control of the Commander-in-Chief and, from 1970, the military zones were also put under his direct control, with the Eastern Military Zone becoming a joint command. When the conflict erupted, the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola only included 6500 men, of whom 1500 were metropolitan Europeans and the remainder locals. By the end of the conflict, the number had increased to more than 65 000, of whom 57.6% were metropolitans and the remainder locals.

The land forces in Angola constituted the 3rd Military Region of the Portuguese Army (renamed &quot;Military Region of Angola, RMA&quot; in 1962). The Military Region was foreseen to include five subordinate regional territorial commands, but these had not yet been activated. The disposition of the army units in the province at the beginning of the conflict had been established in 1953, at that a time when no internal conflicts were expected in Angola, and the major Portuguese military concern was the expected conventional war in Europe against the Warsaw Pact. So, the previous organization of the former Colonial Military Forces based in company-sized units scattered across Angola, also performing internal security duties, shifted to one along conventional lines, based in three infantry regiments and several battalion-sized units of several arms concentrated in the major urban centers, aimed at being able to raise an expeditionary field division to be deployed from Angola to reinforce the Portuguese Army in Europe if a conventional war occurred. These regiments and other units were, however, mostly in cadre strength, serving as training centers for the conscripts drafted in the province. During the conflict, they were responsible for raising the locally recruited field units. Besides the locally raised units, Army forces in Angola included reinforcement units raised and sent from European Portugal. These were transitory units, mostly made of conscripts (including most of the junior officers and non-commissioned officers), which existed only during the usual two-year period of tour of duty of their members, and were disbanded afterwards. The great majority of these units were light infantry battalions and independent companies designated . These battalions and companies were designed to operate autonomously and independently, without much support from higher echelons, so having a strong service support component. They were deployed in a grid system () along the theatre of operations, with each one responsible for a given area of responsibility. Usually, a regiment-sized (battlegroup) commanded a sector, divided into several sub-sectors, each constituting the area of responsibility of a battalion. Each battalion, in turn, had field companies dispersed by the sub-sector, each with part of it as its area of responsibility. From 1962, four intervention zones (Northern, Central, Southern and Eastern) were established – renamed &quot;military zones&quot; in 1967 – each grouping several sectors. Due to the low scale guerrilla nature of the conflict, the company became the main tactical unit, with the standard organization in three rifle and one support platoons, being replaced by one based in four identical sub-units known as &quot;combat groups&quot;. The Army also fielded regular units of artillery, armored reconnaissance, engineering, communications, signal intelligence, military police and service support. Besides the regular units, the Army also fielded units of special forces. Initially, these consisted of companies of , trained in guerrilla and counter-insurgency warfare. The Army tried to extend the training of the special to all the light infantry units, disbanding those companies in 1962. This proved impracticable and soon other special forces were created in the form of the Commandos. The Commandos and a few specially selected units were not deployed in a grid, but served instead as mobile intervention units under the direct control of the higher echelons of command.

An unconventional force also fielded by Army was the Dragoons of Angola, a special counterinsurgency horse unit raised in the middle 1960s.

The Portuguese Navy forces were under the command of the Naval Command of Angola. These forces included the Zaire Flotilla (operating on the river Zaire), naval assets (including frigates and corvettes deployed to Angola in rotation), Marines companies and Special Marines detachments. While the Marines companies served as regular naval infantry with the role of protecting the Navy&#x27;s installations and vessels, the Special Marines were special forces, serving as mobile intervention units, specialized in amphibious assaults. The initial focus of the Navy was mainly the river Zaire, with the mission of interdicting the infiltration of guerrillas in Northern Angola from the bordering Republic of Zaire. Later, the Navy also operated in the rivers of Eastern Angola, despite it being a remote interior region at around 1000 km distance from the Ocean.


The Portuguese air assets in Angola were under the command of the 2nd Air Region of the Portuguese Air Force, with headquarters in Luanda. They included a central air base (the Air Base 9 at Luanda) and two sector air bases (the Base-Aerodrome 3 at Negage, Uíge and the Base-Aerodrome 4 at Henrique de Carvalho, Lunda). A fourth air base was being built (Base-Aerodrome 10 at Serpa Pinto, Cuando-Cubando), but it was not completed before the end of the conflict. These bases controlled a number of satellite air fields, including maneuver and alternate aerodromes. Besides these, the Air Force also could count with a number of additional airfields, including those of some of the Army garrisons, in some of which air detachments were permanently deployed. The Air Force also maintained in Angola, the Paratrooper Battalion 21, which served as a mobile intervention unit, with its forces initially being deployed by parachute, but later being mainly used in air assaults by helicopter. The Air Force was supported by the voluntary air formations, composed of civil pilots, mainly from local flying clubs, who operated light aircraft mainly in air logistics support missions. In the beginning of the conflict, the Air Force had only a few aircraft stationed in Angola, including 25 F-84G jet fighter-bombers, six PV-2 Harpoon bombers, six Nord Noratlas transport aircraft, six Alouette II helicopters, eight T-6 light attack aircraft and eight Auster light observation aircraft. By the early 1970s, it had available four F-84G, six PV-2 Harpoon, 13 Nord Noratlas, C-47 and C-57 transport aircraft, 30 Alouette III and Puma helicopters, 18 T-6 and 26 Dornier Do 27 observation aircraft. Despite the increase, the number of aircraft was always too few to cover the enormous Angolan territory, besides many being old aircraft difficult to maintain in flying conditions. From the late 1960s, the Portuguese forces in southern Angola were able to count on the support of helicopters and some other air assets of the South African Air Force, with two Portuguese-South African joint air support centers being established.

====Security forces====
The security forces in Angola were under the control of the civil authorities, headed by the Governor-General of the province. The forces engaged in the war were the Public Security Police (PSP) and the PIDE (renamed DGS in 1969). By the middle of the 1960s, these forces included 10,000 PSP constables and 1,100 PIDE agents.

The PSP was the uniformed preventive police of Angola. It was modeled after the European Portuguese PSP, but it covered the whole territory of the province, including its rural areas and not only the major urban areas as in European Portugal. The PSP of Angola included a general-command in Luanda and district commands in each of the several district capitals, with a network of police stations and posts scattered along the territory. The Angolan PSP was reinforced with mobile police companies deployed by the European Portuguese PSP. The PSP also included the Rural Guard, which was responsible for the protection of farms and other agricultural companies. Besides this, the PSP was responsible to frame the district militias, which were employed mainly in the self-defense of villages and other settlements.

The PIDE (International and State Defense Police) was the Portuguese secret and border police. The PIDE Delegation of Angola included a number of sub-delegations, border posts and surveillance posts. In the war it operated as an intelligence service. The PIDE created and controlled the &quot;Flechas&quot;, a paramilitary unit of special forces made up of natives. The &quot;Flechas&quot; were initially intended to serve mostly as trackers, but due to their effectiveness were increasingly employed in more offensive operations, including pseudo-terrorist operations.

====Para-military and irregular forces====
Besides the regular armed and security forces, there were a number of para-military and irregular forces, some of them under the control of the military and other controlled by the civil authorities.

The OPVDCA (Provincial Organization of Volunteers and Civil Defense of Angola) was a militia-type corps responsible for internal security and civil defense roles, with similar characteristics to those of the Portuguese Legion of European Portugal. It was under the direct control of the Governor-General of the province. Its origin was the Corps of Volunteers organized in the beginning of the conflict, which became the Provincial Organization of Volunteers in 1962, also assuming the role of civil defense in 1964, when it became the OPVDCA. It was made up of volunteers that served in part-time, most of these being initially whites, but latter becoming increasingly multi-racial. In the conflict, the OPVDCA was mainly employed in the defense of people, lines of communications and sensitive installations. It included a central provincial command and a district command in each of the Angolan districts. It is estimated that by the end of the conflict there were 20,000 OPVDCA volunteers.

The irregular paramilitary forces, included a number of different types of units, with different characteristics. Under military control, were the Special Groups (GE) and the Special Troops (TE). The GE were platoon-sized combat groups of special forces made up of native volunteers, which operated in Eastern Angola, usually attached to Army units. The TE had similar characteristics, but were made up of defectors from FNLA, operating in Cabinda and Northern Angola. Under the control of the civil authorities were the (Faithfuls) and the (Loyals). The was a force made up mostly of exiled Katangese gendarmes from the Front for Congolese National Liberation, which opposed Mobutu regime, being organized in three battalions. The was a force made up of political exiles from Zambia.

==== Race and ethnicity in the Portuguese Armed Forces ====
From 1900 to the early 1950s, the Portuguese maintained a separate colonial army in their African possessions, consisting mainly of a limited number of (native companies). Officers and senior NCOs were seconded from the metropolitan army, while junior NCOs were mainly drawn from Portuguese settlers of the overseas territories. The rank and file were a mixture of black African volunteers and white conscripts from the settler community doing their obligatory military service. Black were in theory also liable to conscription but in practice only a limited number were called on to serve. With the change in official status of the African territories from colonies to overseas provinces in 1951, the colonial army lost its separate status and was integrated into the regular forces of Portugal itself. The basis of recruitment for the overseas units remained essentially unchanged.

According to the Mozambican historian João Paulo Borges Coelho, the Portuguese colonial army was segregated along lines of race and ethnicity. Until 1960, there were three classes of soldiers: commissioned soldiers (European and African whites), overseas soldiers (black African or ), and native soldiers (Africans who were part of the regime). These categories were renamed to 1st, 2nd and 3rd class in 1960—which effectively corresponded to the same classification. Later, although skin colour ceased to be an official discriminator, in practice the system changed little—although from the late 1960s onward, blacks were admitted as ensigns (), the lowest rank in the hierarchy of commissioned officers.

Numerically, black soldiers never amounted to more than 41% of the Colonial army, an increase from just 18% at the outbreak of the war. Coelho noted that perceptions of African soldiers varied a good deal among senior Portuguese commanders during the conflict in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. General Costa Gomes, perhaps the most successful counterinsurgency commander, sought good relations with local civilians and employed African units within the framework of an organized counter-insurgency plan. General Spínola, by contrast, appealed for a more political and psycho-social use of African soldiers. General Kaúlza, the most conservative of the three, feared African forces outside his strict control and seems not to have progressed beyond his initial racist perception of the Africans as inferior beings.

Native African troops, although widely deployed, were initially employed only in subordinate roles as enlisted troops or noncommissioned officers. As the war went on, an increasing number of native Angolans rose to positions of command, although of junior rank. After 500 years of colonial rule, Portugal had failed to appoint any native black governors, headmasters, police inspectors, or professors, nor a single commander of senior commissioned rank in the overseas Army.

Here Portuguese colonial administrators fell victim to the legacy of their own discriminatory and limited policies in education, which largely barred indigenous Angolans from an equal and adequate education until well after the outbreak of the insurgency. By the early 1970s, the Portuguese authorities had fully perceived these flaws as wrong and contrary to their overseas ambitions in Portuguese Africa, and willingly accepted a true color blindness policy with more spending in education and training opportunities, which started to produce a larger number of black high-ranked professionals, including military personnel.

===Nationalist and separatist forces===
====UPA/FNLA====
UPA was created on 7 July 1954, as the Union of the Peoples of Northern Angola, by Holden Roberto, a descendant of the old Kongo Royal House, who was born in northern Angola but had lived since his early childhood in the Belgian Congo, where he came to work for the local colonial authorities. In 1958, the movement adopted a more embracing designation, becoming the Union of the Peoples of Angola (UPA). In 1960, Holden Roberto signed an agreement with the MPLA for the two movements to fight together against the Portuguese forces, but he ended up fighting alone. In 1962, UPA merged with the Democratic Party of Angola, becoming the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), assuming itself as a pro-American and anti-Soviet organization. In the same year, it created the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE). UPA and later the FNLA were mainly supported by the Bakongo ethnic group of the old Kingdom of Kongo, including the Northwestern and Northern Angola, as well as parts of the French and Belgian Congos. It had always had strong connections with the former Belgian Congo (named Zaire from 1971 on), among other reasons because Holden Roberto was the friend and brother-in-law of Mobutu Sese Seko.

The armed branch of the FNLA was the National Liberation Army of Angola (ELNA). It was mainly supported by Congo/Zaire—where its troops were based and trained—and by Algeria. They were financed by the US and—despite considering themselves anti-communists—received weapons from Eastern European countries.

====MPLA====
The People&#x27;s Movement of Liberation of Angola (MPLA) was founded in 1956, by the merging of the Party of the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (PLUAA) and the Angolan Communist Party (PCA). The MPLA was an organization of the left-wing politics, which included mixed race and white members of the Angolan &quot;intelligentsia&quot; and urban elites, supported by the Ambundu and other ethnic groups of the Luanda, Bengo, Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul and Mallange districts. It was headed by Agostinho Neto (president) and Viriato da Cruz (secretary-general), both Portuguese-educated urban intellectuals. It was mainly externally supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba, with its tentative to receive support from the United States failing, as these were already supporting UPA/FNLA.

The armed wing of the MPLA was the People&#x27;s Army of Liberation of Angola (EPLA). In its peak, the EPLA included around 4500 fighters, being organized in military regions. It was mainly equipped with Soviet weapons, mostly received through Zambia, which included Tokarev pistol, PPS submachine guns, Simonov automatic rifles, Kalashnikov assault rifles, machine-guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank mines and anti-personnel mines

====UNITA====
The Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was created in 1966 by Jonas Savimbi, a dissident of FNLA. Jonas Savimbi was the Foreign Minister of the GRAE but in the course of time clashed with Holden Roberto, accusing him of having complicity with the US and of following an imperialist policy. Savimbi was a member of the Ovimbundu tribe of Central and Southern Angola, son of an Evangelic pastor, who went to study medicine in European Portugal, although he never graduated. The group followed a Maoist ideology initially and received support from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, although they switched to a more broad anti-communist platform after 1975.

The Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FALA) constituted the armed branch of UNITA. They had few fighters and were not well equipped. Its difficulties led Savimbi to make agreements with the Portuguese authorities, focusing more on fighting MPLA.

When the war ended, UNITA was the only one of the nationalist movements that was able to maintain forces operating inside the Angolan territory, while the forces of the remaining movements were eliminated or expelled by Portuguese forces.

====FLEC====

The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) was founded in 1963, by the merging of the Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (MLEC), the Action Committee of the Cabinda National Union (CAUNC) and the Mayombe National Alliance (ALLIAMA). On the contrary of the remaining three movements, FLEC did not fight for the independence of the whole Angola, but only for the independence of Cabinda, which it considered a separate country. Although its activities started still before the withdrawal of Portugal from Angola, the military actions of FLEC occurred mainly after, being aimed against the Angolan armed and security forces. FLEC is the only of the nationalist and separatist movements that still maintains a guerrilla warfare until today.

====RDL====

The Eastern Revolt (RDL) was a dissident wing of the MPLA, created in 1973, under the leadership of Daniel Chipenda, in opposition to the line of Agostinho Neto. A second dissident wing was the Active Revolt, created at the same time.

==Pre-war events==
=== International politics ===
The international politics of the late 1940s and 1950s was marked by the Cold War and the wind of change in the European colonies in Asia and Africa.

In October 1954, the Algerian War was initiated by a series of explosions in Algiers. This conflict would lead to the presence of more than 400,000 French military in Algeria until its end in 1962. Foreseeing a similar conflict in its African territories, the Portuguese military paid acute attention to this war, sending observers and personnel to be trained in the counter-insurgence warfare tactics employed by the French.

In 1955, the Bandung Conference was held in Indonesia, with the participation of 29 Asian and African countries, most of which were newly independent. The conference promoted the Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and opposed colonialism or neocolonialism. It was an important step towards the Non-Aligned Movement.

Following the admission of Portugal to the United Nations in December 1955, the Secretary-General officially asked the Portuguese Government if the country had non-self-governing territories under its administration. Maintaining consistency with its official doctrine that all Portuguese overseas provinces were an integral part of Portugal as was the Portuguese European territory, the Portuguese Government responded that Portugal did not have any territories that could be qualified as non-self-governing and so it did not have any obligation of providing any information requested under the Article 73 of the United Nations Charter.

In 1957, Ghana (former British Gold Coast) becomes the first European colony in Africa to achieve independence, under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah. In 1958, he organized the Conference of African Independent States, which aimed to be the African Bandung.

The former Belgian Congo and northern neighbor of Angola became independent in 1960, as the Republic of the Congo (known as &quot;Congo-Léopoldville&quot; and later &quot;Congo-Kinshasa&quot;, being renamed &quot;Republic of Zaire&quot; in 1971), with Joseph Kasa-Vubu as president and Patrice Lumumba as prime-minister. Immediately after independence, a number of violent disturbances occurred leading to the Congo Crisis. The white population became a target, with more than 80,000 Belgian residents being forced to flee from the country. The Katanga seceded under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe. The crisis led to the intervention of United Nations and Belgian military forces. The Congolese internal conflicts would culminate with the ascension to power of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1965.

John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as President of the United States on 20 January 1961. His Administration started to support the African nationalist movements, with the objective of neutralizing the increasing Soviet influence in Africa. Regarding Angola, the United States started to give direct support to the UPA and assumed an hostile attitude against Portugal, forbidding it to use American weapons in Africa.

In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia, under the leadership of Kenneth Kaunda. From then on, Angola was almost entirely surrounded by countries with regimes hostile to Portugal, the exception being South West Africa.

=== Internal politics and rise of Angolan nationalism ===
The Portuguese Colonial Act – passed on 13 June 1933 – defined the relationship between the Portuguese overseas territories and the metropole, until being revised in 1951. The Colonial Act reflected an imperialistic view of the overseas territories typical among the European colonial powers of the late 1920s and 1930s. During the period in which it was in force, the Portuguese overseas territories lost the status of &quot;provinces&quot; that they have had since 1834, becoming designated &quot;colonies&quot;, with the whole Portuguese overseas territories becoming officially designated &quot;Portuguese Colonial Empire&quot;. The Colonial Act subtly recognized the supremacy of the Portuguese over native people, and even if the natives could pursue all studies including university, the &quot;de facto&quot; situation was of clear disadvantage due to deep cultural and social differences between most of the traditional indigenous communities and the ethnic Portuguese living in the Angola.

Due to its imperialist orientation, the Colonial Act started to be called into question. In 1944, José Ferreira Bossa, former Minister of the Colonies, proposed the revision of the Act, including the end up of the designation &quot;colonies&quot; and the resume of the traditional designation &quot;overseas provinces&quot;. On 11 June 1951, a new law passed in the Portuguese National Assembly reviewed the Constitution, finally repulsing the Colonial Act. As part of these, the provincial status was returned to all Portuguese overseas territories. By this law, the Portuguese territory of Angola ceased to be called (Colony of Angola) and started again to be officially called (Province of Angola).

In 1948, Viriato da Cruz and others formed the Movement of Young Intellectuals, an organization that promoted Angolan culture. Nationalists sent a letter to the United Nations calling for Angola to be given protectorate status under UN supervision.

In the 1950s, a new wave of Portuguese settlement in all of Portuguese Africa, including the overseas province of Angola, was encouraged by the ruling government of António de Oliveira Salazar.

In 1953, Angolan separatists founded the Party of the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (PLUAA), the first political party to advocate Angolan independence from Portugal. In 1954, ethnic Bakongo nationalists in the Belgian Congo and Angola formed the Union of Peoples of Northern Angola (UPA), which advocated the independence of the historical Kingdom of Kongo, which included other territories outside the Portuguese overseas province of Angola.

During 1955, Mário Pinto de Andrade and his brother Joaquim formed the Angolan Communist Party (PCA). In December 1956 PLUAA merged with the PCA to form the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The MPLA, led by da Cruz, Mário Andrade, Ilidio Machado, and Lúcio Lara, derived support from the Ambundu and in Luanda.

In March 1959, when inaugurating the new military shooting range of Luanda, the Governor-General of Angola, Sá Viana Rebelo, made the famous Shooting Range Speech, where he predicted a possible conflict in Angola.

General Monteiro Libório assumed the command of the land forces of Angola, with prerogatives of commander-in-chief, in September 1959. He would be the Portuguese military commander in office when the conflict erupts.

Álvaro Silva Tavares assumed the office of Governor-General of Angola in January 1960, being the holder of the office when the conflict erupted.

During January 1961, Henrique Galvão, heading a group of operatives of the DRIL oppositionist movement, hijacked the Portuguese liner &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. The intention of Galvão was to set sail to Angola, where he would disembark and establish a rebel Portuguese government in opposition to Salazar, but he was forced to head to Brazil, where he liberated the crew and passengers in exchange for political asylum.

Feeling the need of having forces trained in counter-insurgency operations, the Portuguese Army created the Special Operations Troops Centre in April 1960, where companies of special forces (baptized ) started preparations. The first three companies of special (CCE) were dispatched to Angola in June 1960, mainly due to the Congo Crisis. Their main mission was to protect the Angolan regions bordering the ex-Belgian Congo, each being stationed in Cabinda (1st CCE), in Toto, Uíge (2nd CCE) and Malanje (3rd CCE).

===The Baixa de Cassanje revolt===

Although usually considered as an event that predates the Angolan War of Independence, some authors consider the Baixa de Cassanje revolt, also known as &quot;Maria&#x27;s War&quot;, as the initial event of the conflict. It was a labour conflict, not related directly with the calls for independence. The Baixa do Cassanje was a rich agricultural region of the Malanje District, bordering the ex-Belgian Congo, with approximately the size of Mainland Portugal, which was the origin of most of the cotton production of Angola. The region&#x27;s cotton fields were in the hands of the Cotonang - General Company of the Cottons of Angola, a company mostly held by Belgian capital and which employed many natives. Despite its contribution for the development of the region, Cotonang had been accused several times of disrespecting the labour legislation regarding working conditions of its employees, causing it to become under the investigation of the Portuguese authorities, but with no relevant actions against it being yet taken.

Feeling discontent with Cotonang, in December 1960, many of its workers started to strike, demanding better working conditions and higher wages. The discontent was seized by infiltrated indoctrinators of the Congolese PSA (African Solidarity Party) to foment an uprising of the local peoples. At that time, the only Portuguese Army unit stationed in the region was the 3rd Special Company (3rd CCE), tasked with the patrolling and protection of the border with the ex-Belgian Congo. Despite receiving complains from local whites who felt their security threatened, the Governor of the Malanje District, Júlio Monteiro – a mixed race Cape Verdean – did not authorize the 3rd CCE to act against the rebels and also forbade the acquisition of self-defense weapons by the white population. From 9 to 11 January 1961, the situation worsened, with the murder of a mixed race Cotonang foreman and with the surrounding of a 3rd CCE patrol by hundreds of rebels. Finally, on 2 February, the clashes between the rebels and the security forces erupted, with the first shots being fired, causing 11 deaths. By that time, the uprising had spread to the whole Malanje District and threatened to spread to the neighboring districts. The rebel leaders took advantage of the superstitious beliefs of most of their followers to convince them that the bullets of the Portuguese military forces were made of water and so could do no harm. Presumably due to this belief, the rebels, armed with machetes and &quot;canhangulos&quot; (home-made shotguns), attacked the military en masse, in the open field, without concern for their own protection, falling under the fire of the troops.

Given the limitations of the 3rd CCE to deal with the uprising in such a large region, the Command of the 3rd Military Region in Luanda decided to organize an operation with a stronger military force to subjugate it. A provisional battalion under the command of Major Rebocho Vaz was organized by the Luanda Infantry Regiment, integrating the 3rd CCE, the 4th CCE (stationed in Luanda) and the 5th CCE (that was still en route from the Metropole to Angola). On 4 February, the 4th CCE was already embarked in the train ready to be dispatched to Malanje, when an uprising at Luanda erupted, with several prisons and Police facilities being stormed. Despite the indefinite situation at Luanda and despite having few combat units available there, General Libório, commander of the 3rd Military Region decided to go forward with the sending of the 4th CCE to Malanje, which arrived there on 5 February. The provisional battalion started gradually the operations to subdue the uprising.

The land forces were supported by the Portuguese Air Force, which employed Auster light observation and PV-2 ground attack aircraft. The military forces were able to assume the control of the region by 11 February. By the 16th, the provisional battalion was finally reinforced with the 5th CCE which had been held in Luanda as a reserve force after disembarking in Angola. Baixa do Cassanje was officially considered pacified on 27 February. The anti-Portuguese forces claimed that, during the subduing of the uprising, the Portuguese military bombed villages in the area, using napalm and killing between 400 and 7000 natives. However, the Portuguese military reported that no napalm was ever used in the operations and that the number of rebels dead was inferior to 300, plus 100 registered injured treated at the Malanje Hospital. The military forces suffered two dead and four injured.

After the subdue of the uprising, the Portuguese military pressed the Government-General of Angola to take actions to improve the working conditions of the Cotonang employees in order to solve definitely the situation. The Governor-General Silva Tavares took measures to calm down the situation and on 2 May 1961, the Government decreed the change of the labor legislation related with cotton culture. Apparently, these measures were successful in deeply reducing the discontent among the laborers of the Baixa de Cassanje, with the region remaining peaceful even after the UPA attacks of 15 March 1961.

===The 4 and 10 February events at Luanda===
The facts about the events of 4 and 10 February 1961 are still very much clouded by the propaganda and contradictory information issued by the various parties about what really happened.

At a time when Luanda was full of foreign journalists that were covering the possible arriving at Angola of the hijacked liner &quot;Santa Maria&quot; and with the Baixa de Casanje revolt on its peak, on the early morning of 4 February 1961, a number of black militants, mostly armed with machetes, ambushed a Public Security Police (PSP) patrol-car and stormed the Civil Jail of São Paulo, the Military Detection House and the PSP Mobile Company Barracks, with the apparent objective of freeing political prisoners that were being held in those facilities. They were not able to storm other planned targets like the Airport, the National Broadcast Station, post office and military barracks. Different sources indicate the number of militants involved in the attacks as being between 50 and several hundred. The militants were able to kill the crew of the patrol-car, taking their weapons, but their assaults against the several facilities was repulsed, not being able to release any prisoners. In the assaults, the security forces suffered seven dead, including five white and one black police constables and a white Army corporal, besides having several seriously injured elements. Different sources indicate between 25 and 40 attackers killed.

The MPLA always officially claimed to be the originator of the attacks. However, this is contested. Several sources indicate the Angolan nationalist mixed race priest Manuel das Neves as the perpetrator of the attacks. Apparently this was also the PIDE theory, which arrested and sent him to the Metropole, where he was interned in religious houses.

An emotional funeral for the deceased police constables was held on 5 February, which was attended by thousands of persons, the majority being white inhabitants of Luanda. During the funeral, riots broke out, which would cause additional dead. There are several contradictory versions of what happened. The anti-Portuguese line states that the riots were originated by the whites, who desired to revenge the dead police constables, committing random acts of violence against the ethnic black majority living in Luanda&#x27;s slums (&quot;musseques&quot;). Contrary versions state that the riots were caused when provocative shots were fired near the cemetery where the funeral was being held, causing panic among the attendants. The riots caused a number of dead, which number varies accordingly with the sources. The anti-Portuguese line describes a massacre carried away by the white inhabitants and the security forces, with hundreds of blacks being killed. Following this line of thought:

However, other sources refer that the theory of the massacre is mere anti-Portuguese false propaganda and that only 19 persons died in the riots. Following this line:
On 10 February, a similar attack was carried out against the Jail of São Paulo. However, the security forces were better prepared and were able to repulse the attacks without any of their men being killed, however, 22 of the attackers were killed. Apparently, other attacks were being planned, but were discovered and averted by the security forces.

==Course of the conflict==
=== Beginning of the conflict ===
On March 15, 1961, the Union of Peoples of Angola (UPA), under the leadership of Holden Roberto, launched an incursion into northern Angola from its base in the Congo-Léopoldville (the former Belgian Congo), leading 4,000 to 5,000 militants. His forces took farms, government outposts, and trading centers, killing and mutilating officials and civilians, most of them ovimbundu, &quot;contract workers&quot; from the Central Highlands. This began the Angolan War of Independence and of the wider Portuguese Overseas War. UPA militants stormed the Angolan districts of Zaire Province, Uíge, Cuanza Norte and Luanda, massacring the civilian population during their advance, killing 1,000 whites and 6,000 blacks (women and children included in both numbers). Besides the killings, the UPA militants destroyed the infrastructure along their way, including houses, farms, roads and bridges, and created general chaos and panic. The terrified population took refuge in the forests or fled to nearby regions and to Congo-Léopoldville.

However, contrary to the expectations of the UPA, the majority of the white inhabitants who survived the initial attacks did not flee, except some women and children who were evacuated to Luanda. Instead, they entrenched themselves in several towns and villages of the region – including Carmona, Negage, Sanza Pombo, Santa Cruz, Quimbele and Mucaba – resisting the assaults almost without the support of the few existent military forces.

On the same day and on the 16th, the 7th and the 9th Special companies and the 1st Paratrooper Company were dispatched from the metropole to Angola by air. Other similar small units of arrived in the following days. Small military columns left Luanda and Carmona to rescue some of the isolated populations of the areas under UPA attack. On 21 March, the Provisional Battalion of Major Rebocho Vaz – which acted in the Baixa de Cassanje revolt – moved to Cuanza Norte to face the UPA advance.

Without military reinforcements from the metropole, on 28 March the Corps of Volunteers of Angola was created, to officially frame the civil volunteers who were already fighting the UPA.

In early April, the village of Cólua, near Aldeia Viçosa, Uíge was attacked and its inhabitants massacred by the UPA A military column from the Provisional Battalion was sent to the village to try to collect the dead bodies. However, an isolated group of soldiers (including two officers) remained behind and was ambushed, their bodies later found horribly mutilated. Another military patrol sent to the area was also ambushed, and some of their members fell into UPA hands and were tortured, mutilated and killed. 30 civilians and 11 military were eventually killed at Cólua. Later testimony reported that UPA militants practiced cannibalism, eating parts of the dead bodies of soldiers. The Cólua events had an important psychological effect on the Portuguese forces, not only due to the horrifying acts practiced against its soldiers, but also because they realized that the insurgents now dared to attack military forces and not just defenseless civilians.

On 11 April, the Minister of National Defense Júlio Botelho Moniz – discontent with the attitude of Prime Minister Salazar regarding the Overseas policy and the conflict in Angola – lead a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; attempt, which failed. Following the aborted coup and now realizing that the conflict in Angola was more serious than what was initially thought, Prime Minister Salazar dismissed Botelho Moniz and assumed himself the Defense portfolio. On 13 April, Salazar spoke on television about the situation in Angola, using the famous phrase (To Angola, rapidly and in force). As part of the government remodeling, Adriano Moreira was appointed Overseas Minister, initiating a series of liberal reforms in the Portuguese Overseas territories.

A strong military mobilization was then initiated by the Portuguese Armed Forces. Finally, on 21 March, the first important military contingent from the Metropole (including the &quot;Caçadores&quot; battalions 88 and 92) embarked in the ocean liner &quot;Niassa&quot;, arriving at Luanda on 2 May. The cargo ship &quot;Benguela&quot; also departed to Angola, carrying war material. In a demonstration of force, the military units at Luanda paraded along the main avenue of the city.

On 13 May, the units from the Metropole start to move to Northern Angola, to occupy strategic positions. Until June, Army units were positioned in Damba, Sanza Pombo, São Salvador do Congo and Cuimba, while &quot;Fuzileiros&quot; (Marines) occupied Tomboco. Due to the blocked roads, destroyed bridges and ambushes, the movement of the units was slow, with the Portuguese forces suffering numerous casualties. After occupying these positions, the Portuguese units initiated the gradual re-occupation of the areas controlled by the UPA.

In June, Air Force General Augusto Venâncio Deslandes was appointed Governor-General of Angola, replacing Silva Tavares. General António Libório was replaced by General Carlos Silva Freire in the role of commander of the 3rd Military Region (commander of land forces of Angola). General Silva Freire would maintain prerogatives of joint Commander-in-Chief until September, when Venâncio Deslandes was also appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Angola, accumulating this role with that of Governor-General.

On 10 July, the Portuguese forces initiate its first major operation of the conflict, this being Operation Viriato (Viriathus), aimed at re-conquering the town of Nambuangongo, in the Dembos forest, which had been proclaimed by UPA as its capital. The operation was still planned as a conventional-type maneuver, with &quot;Caçadores&quot; battalions 96 and 114 and Cavalry Squadron 149 converging in Nambuangongo through three axes of attack, with the support of artillery, engineering and air forces. On 9 August, the vanguard of the Battalion 96 of Lieutenant-Colonel Armando Maçanita finally arrived and re-occupied Nambuagongo. In their advance, the three military units suffer 75 casualties, including 21 dead.

The Portuguese forces focused in the re-occupation of the village of Quipedro, in order to eliminate the rebellious forces in the area and to cut off their flight from Nambuangongo to the North, as a follow-up of Operation Viriato. For this, they began Operation Nema, which included the first airborne assault in combat of the Portuguese military history. The operation was carried through between 11 and 21 August, with the 1st Company of the recently created Paratroopers Battalion 21 of Angola jumping by parachute over the target, after preparation air strikes. The rebels were taken by surprise, with the paratroopers being able to occupy Quipedro almost without resistance. They then built an improvised runway and waited for the arriving of Cavalry Squadron 149 that was advancing by land from Nambuangongo.

In August, by order of General Silva Freire, the Northern Intervention Zone (ZIN) was created, encompassing the districts of Luanda, Cabinda, Uige, Zaire, Malange and Cuanza Norte, replacing the so-called &quot;Northern Uprising Zone&quot;. Despite not existing still a conflict in this area, an Eastern Intervention Zone (ZIL) – covering the districts of Lunda and Moxico – is also created in the following month.

As part of his reforms, Minister Adriano Moreira decreed the repulsion of the &quot;Statute of the Portuguese Indigenous of the Provinces of Guinea, Angola and Mozambique&quot; on 6 August. With the abolition of this statute, all Angolans, independently of their race, education, religion and costumes, achieve identical Portuguese citizenship rights and obligations.

On 10 April, the Operation Esmeralda (Emerald) – aimed at cleaning and retaking the control of Pedra Verde, UPA&#x27;s last base in northern Angola – was initiated by the Special &quot;Caçadores&quot; Battalion 261, supported by paratroopers, artillery, armored cars and aviation elements. The initial assault was repulsed by the UPA forces, with the Portuguese suffering important casualties. The Portuguese regrouped and, days later, launched a second assault, finally taking control of Pedra Verde on 16 September.

On 9 June, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 163, declaring Angola a non-self-governing territory and calling on Portugal to desist from repressive measures against the Angolan people. The resolution was approved with the votes of China, United States, Soviet Union and of all the non-permanent members, with the abstaining of France and the United Kingdom.

The major military operations finally terminated on 3 October, when a platoon of the Artillery Company 100 reoccupied Caiongo, in the circle of Alto Cauale, Uíge, the last abandoned administrative post that remained unrecovered. This reoccupation ended the almost six-month period during which the UPA fighters were able to control a geographic area with four times the size of European Portugal.

In a speech made on 7 October, the Governor-General and Commanding-in-Chief Venâncio Deslandes announces the termination of the military operations and that from then only police operations would be carried out, although partly in military scope.
 
During an air reconnaissance in southern Angola on 10 November, the aircraft that was carrying General Silva Freire and his staff crashed, killing him and almost all the officers of the headquarters of the land forces of Angola. Because of this crash, General Francisco Holbeche Fino was appointed commander of the 3rd Military Region.

In the first year of the war, 20,000 to 30,000 Angolans were killed, and between 300,000 and 500,000 refugees fled to Zaïre or Luanda. UPA militants joined pro-independence refugees and continued to launch attacks from across the border in Zaire, creating more refugees and terror among local communities. A UPA patrol took 21 MPLA militant prisoners and then executed them on 9 October 1961 in the Ferreira incident, sparking further violence between the two sides.

Holden Roberto merged UPA with the Democratic Party of Angola (PDA) to form the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in March 1962. A few weeks later he established the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE) on 27 March, appointing Jonas Savimbi to the position of Foreign Minister. Roberto established a political alliance with Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko by divorcing his wife and marrying a woman from Mobutu&#x27;s wife&#x27;s village. Roberto visited Israel and received aid from the Israeli government from 1963 to 1969.

Romania was the first state to sign agreements with the MPLA. In May 1974, Nicolae Ceaușescu reaffirmed Romania&#x27;s support for Angolan independence. As late as September 1975, Bucharest publicly supported all three Angolan liberation movements (FNLA, MPLA and UNITA).

The MPLA held a party congress in Leopoldville in 1962, during which, Viriato da Cruzfound to be slow, negligent, and adverse to planningwas replaced by Agostinho Neto. In addition to the change in leadership, the MPLA adopted and reaffirmed its policies for an independent Angola:
* Democracy
* Multiracialism
* Non-alignment
* Nationalization
* National liberation of the entire colony
* No foreign military bases in Angola

Savimbi left the FNLA in 1964 and founded UNITA in response to Roberto&#x27;s unwillingness to spread the war outside the traditional Kingdom of Kongo. Neto met Marxist leader Che Guevara in 1965 and soon received funding from the governments of Cuba, German Democratic Republic, and the Soviet Union.

===Opening of the Eastern Front===

In May 1966, Daniel Chipenda, then a member of MPLA, established the (Eastern Front), significantly expanding the MPLA&#x27;s reach in Angola. When the EF collapsed, Chipenda and Neto each blamed the other&#x27;s factions.

UNITA carried out its first attack on 25 December 1966, preventing trains from passing through the Benguela railway at Teixeira de Sousa on the border with Zambia. UNITA derailed the railway twice in 1967, angering the Zambian government, which exported copper through the railway. President Kenneth Kaunda responded by kicking UNITA&#x27;s 500 fighters out of Zambia. Savimbi moved to Cairo, Egypt, where he lived for a year. He secretly entered Angola through Zambia and worked with the Portuguese military against the MPLA.

UNITA had its main base in distant south-eastern Angolan provinces, where the Portuguese and FNLA influence were for all practical purposes very low, and where there was no guerrilla war at all. UNITA was from the beginning far better organized and disciplined than either the MPLA or the FNLA. Its fighters also showed a much better understanding of guerrilla operations. They were especially active along the Benguela railway, repeatedly causing damage to the Portuguese, and to the Republic of Congo and Zambia, both of which used the railway for transportation of their exports to Angolan ports.

On 19 May 1968, FNLA entered Eastern Angola and carried out its first violent actions in the region against the local populations.

During October 1968, the Portuguese forces initiated Operation (Victory) against the MPLA, assaulting and destroying its main bases at Eastern Angola. Among others, the Mandume III base (headquarters of the MPLA&#x27;s III Military Region) was assaulted by the Portuguese Commandos, leading to the capture of important documents.
During the late 1960s, the FNLA and MPLA fought each other as much as they did the Portuguese, with MPLA forces assisting the Portuguese in finding FNLA hideouts.

In the late 1969, the Portuguese forces organize the Battle Group &quot;Sirocco&quot; ( Siroco), a highly mobile composite task force aimed at hunting and destroying the guerrilla forces operating in Eastern Angola. The land component of the task force was centered in Commando companies, being supported by an air component with helicopters and light aircraft. On 1 September, Battle Group &quot;Sirocco&quot; initiated a long series of highly successful operations in the Eastern region. Battle Group &quot;Sirocco&quot; (remodeled as &quot;Sirocco 1970&quot; and &quot;Sirocco 1971&quot;, respectively in 1970 and 1971) would be active for three years, in 1972 being replaced by the similar Battle Group &quot;Ray&quot; ( Raio).

=== Portuguese re-focus to the east ===
The MPLA began forming squadrons of 100 to 145 militants in 1971. These squadrons, armed with 60 mm and 81 mm mortars, attacked Portuguese outposts. The Portuguese conducted counter-insurgency sweeps against MPLA forces in 1972, destroying some MPLA camps. Additionally, the South African Defence Force engaged the MPLA forces in Moxico in February 1972, destroying the Communist presence. The Portuguese Armed Forces organised a successful campaign to control and pacify the entire Eastern Front (the Frente Leste). Portuguese efforts after 1972 were aided by the defection of UNITA, which began providing intelligence on the MPLA to colonial forces. Neto, defeated, retreated with 800 militants to the Republic of the Congo. Differing factions in the MPLA then jockeyed for power until the Soviet Union allied with the Chipenda faction. On 17 March 1,000 FNLA fighters mutinied in Kinkuzu, but the Zairian army put down the rebellion on behalf of Roberto.
In 1973, Chipenda left the MPLA, founding the Eastern Revolt with 1,500 former MPLA followers. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere convinced the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which had begun funding the MPLA in 1970, to ally with the FNLA against the MPLA in 1973. Roberto visited the PRC in December and secured Chinese support. The Soviet Union cut off aid to the MPLA completely in 1974 when Revolta Activa split off from the mainstream MPLA. In November the Soviet Union resumed aid to the MPLA after Neto reasserted his leadership.

The combined forces of the MPLA, the UNITA, and the FNLA succeeded in their rebellion not because of their success in battle, but because of the Movimento das Forças Armadas&#x27; coup in Portugal. The MFA was an organisation of lower-ranked officers in the Portuguese Armed Forces which was responsible for the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, which ended the Portuguese Colonial War and led to the independence of the Portuguese overseas territories.

The MFA overthrew the Lisbon government in protest against the authoritarian political regime and the ongoing African colonial wars, specially the particularly demanding conflict in Portuguese Guinea. The revolutionary Portuguese government removed the remaining elements of its colonial forces and agreed to a quick handover of power to the nationalist African movements. This put an immediate end to the independence war against Portugal, but opened the door for a bitter armed conflict among the independentist forces and their respective allies. Holden Roberto, Agostinho Neto, and Jonas Savimbi met in Bukavu, Zaire in July and agreed to negotiate with the Portuguese as one political entity, but afterwards the fight broke out again.

=== End of the conflict ===
The three party leaders met again in Mombasa, Kenya on 5 January 1975 and agreed to stop fighting each other, further outlining constitutional negotiations with the Portuguese. They met for a third time, with Portuguese government officials, in Alvor, Portugal from 10 till 15 January. They signed on 15 January what became known as the Alvor Agreement, granting Angola independence on 11 November and establishing a transitional government.

The agreement ended the war for independence while marking the transition to civil war. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) and Eastern Revolt never signed the agreement as they were excluded from negotiations. The coalition government established by the Alvor Agreement soon fell as nationalist factions, doubting one another&#x27;s commitment to the peace process, tried to take control of the colony by force.

The parties agreed to hold the first assembly elections in October 1975. From 31 January until independence a transitional government consisting of the Portuguese High Commissioner Rosa Coutinho and a Prime Ministerial Council would rule. The PMC consisted of three representatives, one from each Angolan party, and a rotating premiership among the representatives. Every decision required two-thirds majority support. The twelve ministries were divided equally among the Angolan parties and the Portuguese government: three ministries for each party. Author Witney Wright Schneidman criticized this provision in &quot;Engaging Africa: Washington and the Fall of Portugal&#x27;s Colonial Empire&quot; for ensuring a &quot;virtual paralysis in executive authority&quot;. The Bureau of Intelligence and Research cautioned that an excessive desire to preserve the balance of power in the agreement hurt the transitional Angolan government&#x27;s ability to function.

The Portuguese government&#x27;s main goal in negotiations was preventing the mass emigration of white Angolans. Paradoxically, the agreement only allowed the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA to nominate candidates to the first assembly elections, deliberately disenfranchising Bakongo, Cabindans, and whites. The Portuguese reasoned that white Angolans would have to join the separatist movements and the separatists would have to moderate their platforms to expand their political bases.

The agreement called for the integration of the militant wings of the Angolan parties into a new military, the Angolan Defense Forces. The ADF would have 48,000 active personnel, made up of 24,000 Portuguese and 8,000 MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA fighters respectively. Each party maintained separate barracks and outposts. Every military decision required the unanimous consent of each party&#x27;s headquarters and the joint military command. The Portuguese forces lacked equipment and commitment to the cause, while Angolan nationalists were antagonistic of each other and lacked training. The treaty, to which the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) never agreed, described Cabinda as an &quot;integral and inalienable part of Angola&quot;. Separatists viewed the agreement as a violation of the Cabindan right to self-determination.

All three parties soon had forces greater in number than the Portuguese, endangering the colonial power&#x27;s ability to keep the peace. Factional fighting renewed, reaching new heights as foreign supplies of arms increased. In February the Cuban government warned the Eastern Bloc that the Alvor Agreement would not succeed. By spring the African National Congress and the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) were echoing Cuba&#x27;s warning. Leaders of the Organization of African Unity organized a peace conference moderated by Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta with the three leaders in Nakuru, Kenya in June. The Angolan leaders issued the Nakuru Declaration on 21 June, agreeing to abide by the provisions of the Alvor Agreement while acknowledging a mutual lack of trust which led to violence.

In July, fighting again broke out and the MPLA managed to force the FNLA out of Luanda; UNITA voluntarily withdrew from the capital to its stronghold in the south from where it also engaged in the struggle for the country. By August the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. On 12 August, Portugal began airlifting more than 200,000 white Portuguese Angolans from Luanda to Lisbon, via &quot;Operation Air Bridge&quot;. South African forces invaded Angola on 23 October 1975, covertly sending 1,500 to 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola. FNLA-UNITA-South African forces took five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela in three weeks. On 10 November the Portuguese left Angola. Cuban-MPLA forces defeated South African-FNLA forces, maintaining control over Luanda. On 11 November NATO declared the independence of the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola. The FNLA and UNITA responded by proclaiming their own government based in Huambo. The South African Army retreated and, with the help of Cuban forces, the MPLA retook most of the south in the beginning of 1976.

Many analysts have blamed the transitional government in Portugal for the violence that followed the Alvor Agreement, criticizing the lack of concern about internal Angolan security, and the favoritism towards the MPLA. High Commissioner Coutinho, one of the seven leaders of the National Salvation Junta, openly gave Portuguese military equipment to MPLA forces. Edward Mulcahy, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the United States State Department, told Tom Killoran, the U.S. Consul General in Angola, to congratulate the PMC rather than the FNLA and UNITA on their own and Coutinho for Portugal&#x27;s &quot;untiring and protracted efforts&quot; at a peace agreement. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger considered any government involving the pro-Soviet, communist MPLA, to be unacceptable and President Gerald Ford oversaw heightened aid to the FNLA.

== Foreign influence ==
=== United States ===
The situation of the Portuguese in their overseas province of Angola soon became a matter of concern for a number of foreign powers particularly her military allies in NATO. The United States, for example, was concerned with the possibility of a Marxist regime being established in Luanda. That is why it started supplying weapons and ammunition to the UPA, which meanwhile grew considerably and merged with the Democratic Party of Angola to form the FNLA.

The leaders of the FNLA were, however, not satisfied with the US support. Savimbi consequently established good connections with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, from where even larger shipments started arriving. The USA granted the company Aero Associates, from Tucson, Arizona, the permission to sell seven Douglas B-26 Invader bombers to Portugal in early 1965, despite Portugal&#x27;s concerns about their support for the Marxists from Cuba and the USSR.

The aircraft were flown to Africa by John Richard Hawke – reportedly, a former Royal Air Force pilot – who on the start of one of the flights to Angola flew so low over the White House, that the United States Air Force forced him to land and he was arrested. In May 1965, Hawke was indicted for illegally selling arms and supporting the Portuguese, but was imprisoned for less than a year. The B-26s were not to see deployment in Angola until several years later.

=== Rhodesia and South Africa ===
Aside from the US, two other nations became involved in this war. These were Rhodesia and South Africa, both of which were ruled by the white minority. Their white-elected governments were concerned about their own future in the case of a Portuguese defeat. Rhodesia and South Africa initially limited their participation to shipments of arms and supplies. However, by 1968 the South Africans began providing Alouette III helicopters with crews to the Portuguese Air Force (FAP), and finally several companies of South African Defence Forces (SADF) infantry who were deployed in southern and central Angola. However, contemporary reports about them guarding the iron mines of Cassinga were never confirmed.

Finally, there were reports that a number of Rhodesian pilots were recruited to fly FAP helicopters. However, when the first Portuguese unit was equipped with Aerospatiale Puma helicopters, in 1969, its crews were almost exclusively South Africans. Rhodesian pilots were considered too valuable by the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to be deployed in support of the Portuguese. The SADF had pilots and helicopters operating out of the (CCAA – Joint Air Support Centre), setting up in Cuito Cuanavale during 1968.

=== USSR ===
During the late 1960s the USSR also became involved in the war in Angola, albeit almost exclusively via the MPLA. While the FNLA received only very limited arms shipments from the US, and the UNITA was getting hardly any support from outside the country, the Marxist MPLA developed very close relations with Moscow and was soon to start receiving significant shipments of arms via Tanzania and Zambia.

In 1969 the MPLA agreed with the USSR that in exchange for arms and supplies delivered to it the Soviets would—upon independence—be granted rights for establishing military bases in the country. Consequently, by the early 1970s, the MPLA developed into the strongest Angolan anti-colonial movement and the most powerful political party.

== Aftermath ==

As soon as the agreement between the MPLA and Portugal for the transfer of power became known to the public, a mass exodus began. Over 300,000 people left Angola by November, most of them evacuated aboard TAP Boeing 707 aircraft. The British Royal Air Force also lent a hand, sending Vickers VC10 airliners to evacuate about 6,000 additional refugees. At this stage, the Angolan Civil War had started and spread out across the newly independent country. The devastating civil war lasted several decades and claimed a million lives and refugees in independent Angola.

In the wake of the conflict, Angola faced deterioration in central planning, economic development and growth, security, education and health system issues. Like the other newly independent African territories involved in the Portuguese Colonial War, Angola&#x27;s rank in the human development and GDP per capita world tables fell. After independence, economic and social recession, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial post-independence expectations. A level of economic development comparable to what had existed under Portuguese rule became a major goal for the governments of the independent territory. The sharp recession and the chaos in many areas of Angolan life eroded the initial impetus of nationalistic fervor. There were also eruptions of black racism in the former overseas province against white and mulatto Angolans.

<text>Lee Robert Clark (born 27 October 1972) is an English football manager and former professional player.

As a player, he was a midfielder and played in the Premier League for Newcastle United, Sunderland and Fulham. He won promotion to the top flight with all three clubs he played for, winning out right the Football League First Division title in 1993, 1999 and 2001. He was also part of the Magpies squad under Kevin Keegan that finished runners-up in the top flight in consecutive seasons. He was capped 11 times by the England under-21 team and was called up to the full England squad for the World Cup warm up tournament the 1997 Tournoi de France, but he was only named a substitute and never went on to earn a full international cap.

Following his retirement from playing in 2006, he later returned to Newcastle as reserve team manager, before becoming a first team coach at Norwich City. He later became first team manager at Huddersfield Town and had similar spells in charge of Birmingham City, Blackpool, Kilmarnock, Bury and Blyth Spartans. In 2020 he joined non-league side Newcastle Blue Star as director of football, before moving to Sudan to manage Al-Merrikh.

==Club career==
===Newcastle United===
Born in Wallsend, Northumberland, Clark started his career at the club he supported as a boy, Newcastle United coming up through the youth system at the club. In 1993, he was part of the Newcastle side promoted to the Premier League as champions and then helped them finish as runners-up in both 1995–96 and 1996–97. In 1995–96, Newcastle United were pipped to the title by Manchester United. After a game where Newcastle United drew 3–3 away at Manchester City, Newcastle United purchased defensive midfielder David Batty to shore up the team defensively and Clark, more of an attacking midfielder, lost his place in the side. Clark reasons that this was a mistake that hurt the team dynamic that was working, and that this decision may have cost Newcastle United the title. To back up his claim, Clark cited and compared the form of Newcastle United from January 1996 until he was dropped for defensive midfielder Batty; against the form of Newcastle United in the remaining 11 games when Clark was absent. Clark made nearly 200 appearances scoring 23 goals for Newcastle in his first spell at the club.

===Sunderland===
Clark moved to Newcastle&#x27;s local rivals, First Division club Sunderland, in 1997, and was part of the side promoted to the Premier League in 1999 as champions with a (then) professional league record of 105 points. A year earlier, he had been a key player in the side that reached the First Division play-off final, only to suffer a penalty shoot-out defeat to Charlton Athletic after a 4–4 draw at Wembley.

However, at the 1999 FA Cup final he was spotted with the Newcastle fans wearing a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;Sad Mackem Bastards&quot;. He was immediately dropped from the team, and never played for Sunderland again.

===Fulham===
Clark moved to Fulham in 1999. He collected another Division One title medal with in 2001, enabling him to experience Premier League football for the first time since the 1996–97 season. In 2004, he helped Fulham secure what was, at the time, their highest final position – ninth in the top flight. During that season he opened the scoring as Fulham beat Manchester United 3–1 at Old Trafford in October 2003. Clark left Fulham in 2005 to return to former club Newcastle United, after making 149 league appearances and scoring 20 goals for the West London club.

===Return to Newcastle===
Clark was allowed to leave Fulham after his contract expired in the summer of 2005 despite being club captain during the 2004–05 season. At the time of his departure, he was Fulham&#x27;s longest-serving player. He subsequently returned to Newcastle, coaching and playing on a month-by-month contract.

Clark scored one goal for Newcastle in the 2005–06 season, an equaliser in a 2–2 draw with Middlesbrough. He played his final professional game on 7 May 2006, coming on as a substitute at home to Chelsea. In total he played 265 times for Newcastle, scoring 28 goals.

==International career==
Clark scored a hat-trick for England schoolboys at Wembley Stadium in 1988 in a 4–1 win for England.
He represented England at international level playing for the England under-21s, making 11 appearances between 1992 and 1993 during his time playing for Newcastle.

In 1997, he was a member of England&#x27;s squad for Le Tournoi de France but did not play.

==Coaching career==
On 1 June 2006, the newly appointed Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder installed Clark as a first team coach and reserve team manager following Tommy Craig&#x27;s departure while Clark was still playing for Newcastle. He remained as first team coach and as reserve team manager after retiring in 2007 until Roeder parted company with the club and Clark followed shortly afterwards in November.

In November 2007, Clark left his post at Newcastle to become assistant manager to Roeder at Championship club Norwich City.

Clark joined Newcastle Blue Star in July 2020 as director of football to temporarily oversee the youth section of the football club.

==Managerial career==
===Huddersfield Town===
After League One club Huddersfield Town had dismissed manager Stan Ternent on 4 November 2008, The Terriers were reported to be interested in then Norwich assistant manager Clark. On 12 December 2008, Clark was officially unveiled as the new manager of Huddersfield, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. Clark replaced Gerry Murphy, who had been caretaker manager for the League One side following the departure of Ternent. The first move made by Clark was to appoint Terry McDermott as his assistant as well as bringing in Derek Fazackerley in as first team coach and Steve Black as performance coach, all of whom had previously worked with Newcastle United. Clark officially took over on 15 December; his first game in charge of the club was a 2–0 win over Hereford United on 20 December.

In his first season at the club he helped them to a ninth-placed finish in League One. They also only lost two home league games under Clark in the 2008–09 season.

In his second season in charge, Clark helped Huddersfield to secure a play-off spot and became the first manager to win three Manager of the Month awards in a single season since Roberto Martínez in 2007–08. Huddersfield were defeated by Millwall in the 2009–10 play-off semi-final.

In the 2010–11 season, Clark guided Huddersfield to a third-placed finish in the league, earning them a place in the play-offs after a club-record 25-game unbeaten run in the league. They reached the final after beating AFC Bournemouth 4–2 on penalties, but lost 3–0 to Peterborough United in the Old Trafford final. In July 2011, he agreed a new rolling contract with the club.

Clark continued breaking records at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, extending the unbeaten run in domestic regular-season league games to a Football League record 43 games.

Clark was dismissed as manager of Huddersfield on 15 February 2012 following a 1–0 home defeat to Sheffield United.

=== Birmingham City ===
On 26 June 2012, Clark was confirmed as manager of Birmingham City, with Terry McDermott as his Assistant Manager and Derek Fazackerley and Steve Watson as his First Team Coaches. John Vaughan was brought in as his Goalkeeping Coach and Malcolm Crosby was appointed Chief Scout. Clark signed Peter Løvenkrands, David Lucas, Hayden Mullins and Darren Ambrose in the summer of 2012, as well as Ravel Morrison, Ben Gordon, James Hurst, Leroy Lita, Paul Caddis, Paul Robinson, Rob Hall, Shane Ferguson and Wes Thomas later on throughout the 2012–13 season.

Clark endured a difficult start to his managerial reign, with a draw and two losses in his first three games in the Championship. His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5–0 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Žigić, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4–0 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1–0 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013–14 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee&#x27;s loan was made permanent. The 2013–14 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark&#x27;s right-hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013–14 season against Bolton, the 2–2 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference.

On 20 October 2014, with Birmingham 21st in the table and having won at home in the league only once in more than a year, Clark and assistant Steve Watson were dismissed. At the time of his dismissal, Clark had won 33 of his 116 games – the lowest win ratio for a quarter of a century from a Birmingham manager – and left the club one point above the relegation zone.

=== Blackpool ===
On 30 October 2014, Clark was appointed manager of Blackpool on a one-year rolling deal. Having been bottom of the Championship since October 2014 and having won only four games all season, Blackpool were relegated to League One on 6 April 2015 with six games left to play. On 9 May 2015, Clark resigned as manager of Blackpool following their relegation from the Championship. Blackpool won only three games from 33 played under Clark&#x27;s tenure.

===Kilmarnock===
Clark was appointed manager of Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock on 15 February 2016 while they were in the relegation zone. He went on to help Kilmarnock keep their 23-year long Scottish Premiership status by defeating Falkirk 4–1 in the play off final with the latter of the two legs being a 4–0 thrashing with goals from Greg Kiltie (2), Miles Addison and Kris Boyd. He left the club in February 2017, exactly a year after joining and with the club in the top six.

===Bury===
Clark was appointed manager of League One club Bury on 15 February 2017. With the club in the relegation zone, he was tasked with keeping them in the league and succeeded in doing so. After eight months in charge of Bury, Clark was sacked on 30 October 2017. Four consecutive losses before his dismissal saw Bury second from bottom in League One, at the conclusion of October 2017.

===Blyth Spartans===
On 1 June 2019, National League North club Blyth Spartans unveiled Clark as their new manager. He left by mutual consent on 4 March 2020.

===Al-Merrikh===
On 7 March 2021, Clark was appointed as the new manager of Sudanese club Al-Merrikh and described the opportunity as an &#x27;exciting&#x27; and &#x27;different&#x27; experience. He took charge of his first game - a 2–1 win over Hilal Al-Fasher in the Sudan Premier League on 9 March 2021.

Clark&#x27;s first experience of the CAF Champions League was a 3–0 away defeat to Simba of Tanzania on 16 March 2021 after which he blamed the loss on &#x27;sabotage&#x27;.

On 19 June 2021, Al-Merrikh announced Clark had resigned as manager.

===Al-Ittihad===
In November 2021, Clark was appointed manager of Al-Ittihad of the Oman Professional League and drew 0–0 with Al-Nahda during his first game in charge.

===Return to Al-Merrikh===
On 29 January 2022, Al-Merrikh announced the return of Clark as their manager.

However, Clark was sacked just 51 days later following a 3–1 defeat to Al Ahly in the CAF Champions League.

==Personal life==
Clark&#x27;s son, Bobby, plays as a midfielder for RB Salzburg and featured during Liverpool&#x27;s 1-0 victory in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea in February 2024, before scoring his first professional goal in a UEFA Europa League Round of 16 Second Leg tie against Sparta Praha on 14 March 2024.

<text>The Bog of Allen () is a large raised bog in the centre of Ireland between the rivers Liffey and Shannon.

The bog&#x27;s 958 square kilometres (370 square miles) stretch into counties Offaly, Meath, Kildare, Laois, and Westmeath. Peat is mechanically harvested on a large scale by Bórd na Móna, the government-owned peat production industry. The area has kilometres of narrow gauge industrial railways for transporting turf to processing plants and turf powered power plants. In addition, the cutover portions are used as area for grazing. The bog is crossed by the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal.

==Preservationists==
The Irish Peatland Conservation Council describes the bog as &quot;an important area of peatland, as much a part of Irish natural heritage as the Book of Kells.&quot; The bog is much reduced after centuries of industrial exploitation and recent encroachments by development. Efforts are underway to preserve sections of it.

==Archaeological significance==
The peatlands of the Bog of Allen contain a valuable part of the archaeological record. Due to the special preservation conditions within peat, many kinds of artefact which do not normally survive are preserved; these include wooden structures and objects. In many parts of the Bog of Allen industrial milling has uncovered archaeological remains such as trackways. These trackways are wooden walkways constructed through prehistory and into the medieval period which allowed people and animals to cross the extensive areas of peatland, which can give us an insight into the economy and way of life of the societies that existed around the bog. The preservation conditions in bogs also preserve a range of palaeoenvironmental evidence such as pollen and plant macrofossils which are often studied alongside the archaeological evidence to inform about the environment on and around the bog.
==Palaeoenvironmental studies==
Numerous studies have focused on reconstructing past environments through the study of palaeoenvironmental proxies preserved in the Bog of Allen. Bogs such as these are of particular interest as ombrotrophic bogs are very sensitive to changes in precipitation. A current study carried out on Daingean Bog is investigating the use of testate amoebae to reconstruct changes in precipitation and to link this to climate variability during the Holocene. Such studies are of value as they may be informative about the response of past societies to climate change.

<doc id="1053423" wikidata="Q904663" url="?curid=1053423" title="Football in the United Kingdom">
<text>Football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom. Football is organised on a separate basis in each of the four constituent countries, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, that make up the United Kingdom (UK), with each having a national football association responsible for the overall management of football within their respective country. There is no United Kingdom national football team. Football has been the most popular sport in the UK since the 1860s. Rugby union, rugby league and cricket are other popular sports.

This article provides some comparisons concerning football in the home nations. For details about football across the United Kingdom and its territories, refer to the table below:

==Football associations==

Each of the countries of the United Kingdom, sometimes referred to as the home nations, has a national football association responsible for the overall management of football within their respective nation: The Football Association, (FA) is responsible for England and the Crown Dependencies and was founded in 1863, The Scottish Football Association (SFA) was founded in 1873 followed by the Football Association of Wales (FAW) in 1876 and Irish Football Association (IFA) in 1880. They are the world&#x27;s four oldest national football associations and play an important part in football worldwide as they take up four of the eight seats on the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the Laws of the Game, the other four seats being occupied by FIFA.

==Men&#x27;s International football==


The United Kingdom plays its international football as separate Home Nations teams of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The only exception to this is during the Summer Olympics where the United Kingdom is represented by Great Britain Olympic football team, which despite the name includes Northern Ireland. Some people, such as politician Tony Banks, have argued for the UK having just one team to represent it for all competitions but all four football associations are very much against such an idea.

There are sometimes issues about which team players are eligible for (as all the players representing those teams have British passports), but a player is generally eligible for whichever nation he, his parents or grandparents were born in (in the case of these being different nations, then he can choose). This has been the case with some players such as Aiden McGeady and Jack Collison who have chosen to play for the country of their parental heritage rather than the country of their birth. Players from crown dependencies (i.e. the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), which are technically not in the UK, are eligible for all four teams (e.g. Matt Le Tissier and Graeme Le Saux, both of whom opted for England), as were British citizens born outside the UK or its possessions – Eric Young (born in Singapore) and Pat van den Hauwe (born in Belgium) had previously opted for Wales under the same rule and Maik Taylor (born in Germany to a British father) used it to represent Northern Ireland – but residency criteria now also apply.

===United Kingdom Olympic history===

In the early years, the Olympic football competition was contested between amateur sides, and the British Olympic Committee agreed to let the England amateur team represent the entire UK. More recently the Olympic competition has been played by under-23s teams and Great Britain has not normally been represented. This is because qualification is based on the UEFA Under-21 championship, which means it is impossible for Great Britain to qualify as the national teams participate separately in that competition. There have been instances where an individual nation would have qualified, but a lower ranked nation has taken its place instead.

An exception to this was the 2012 Summer Olympics, which were hosted to London. This meant that Great Britain qualified, by right of being host nation, for the football tournaments. While the English Football Association favoured the idea of a unified team for 2012, the other three federations opposed the concept. The Scottish Football Association was particularly strident in this view, fearing that a single UK team would jeopardise the independent status all four Home Nations enjoy. FIFA set a deadline of 1 June 2009 for the Home Nations to come to an agreement, which resulted in the four associations sending a letter to FIFA stating that while the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland associations still opposed the concept of a unified Great Britain team and would not participate in such a team, they would not prevent England from fielding a team under that banner. FIFA president Sepp Blatter officially approved the deal within days. However, even though the Welsh had said they would not participate in such a team, Welsh players such as Gareth Bale expressed an interest in playing for a unified team. The Football Association chose to disregard the agreement and selected five Welsh players for the men&#x27;s team. The future of Great Britain Olympic teams is uncertain as there is no mechanism for them to qualify for forthcoming tournaments. However, the presence of a unified women&#x27;s team at Tokyo 2020 gave hope for the future of the men&#x27;s team.

===International matches between the home nations===
The UK teams have played each other more times than any other footballing nations in the world. The world&#x27;s first international football match was played between Scotland and England in Glasgow in 1872 (a 0–0 draw). From then on, all four teams started playing regular friendlies against each other. In 1883 a formal competition between the UK&#x27;s teams, the British Home Championship, was introduced, guaranteeing that each team would play the other three at least once a season. The Championship was discontinued in 1984, partly due to problems of crowd trouble, and partly due to the desire of England (and to a lesser extent Scotland) to contest international fixtures against larger and more powerful nations.

While the British Home Championship was being played, the UK teams were also drawn together on a number of occasions during qualification competitions for the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championships. Early tournaments simply used the British Championship as a qualifying group, but during qualification for the 1974 World Cup, England and Wales were drawn in the same group. Subsequent to this, three more qualification tournaments saw UK teams drawn together while the British Championship was being played. Since the end of the British Home Championship, the teams have played each other mainly when drawn together in international competitions such as the European Championship or the World Cup, with occasional friendly fixtures.

In 2011, Vauxhall signed sponsorship deals with the FA, SFA, FAW and IFA, and stated their desire to see the four home nations play each other in a version of the British Home Championship again.

Since the end of the British Home Championship, there have been many calls for it to be restored to the schedule. One argument is that it would replace so-called &quot;meaningless friendlies&quot; with a proper tournament that would raise the interest of both the players and fans. However there has been a lack of enthusiasm for such a proposal, particularly from England; as time has passed, The Football Association has grown in commercial power beyond that of the other three home associations, so that it could be claimed that friendlies against major footballing nations from Europe and South America are worth more than playing the home nations.

In December 2006, Lawrie Sanchez suggested that a tournament featuring the three home Celtic nations plus the Republic of Ireland could be organised. He stated that the IFA hierarchy were supportive of a new Home Championship, while the SFA expressed guarded interest. This was further elaborated in February 2007 when Alex McLeish, the newly appointed manager of Scotland, expressed interest in playing against the home nations and the Republic of Ireland. Accepting that England would probably not be interested in a new Home Championship, he said, &quot;If the English FA are thinking about opposition for the new Wembley, I hope we&#x27;re in their thoughts.&quot; Both England and Wales were less enthusiastic, stating that with the number of friendlies played each year it would &quot;be difficult to see how the Home Nations would fit in&quot;.

On 18 September 2008, it was announced that a tournament featuring the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – the Nations Cup – would be played in 2011. The attendances for the matches, particularly those not involving the Republic or Scotland, were low and the tournament has not been repeated.

==Women&#x27;s International Football==

=== History ===
The history of women&#x27;s club football in the United Kingdom dates back to the early 20th century. Despite facing numerous obstacles and challenges, the sport has seen an increase in popularity and success over the years, becoming an integral part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s sports culture.

The first recorded women&#x27;s football match in the United Kingdom was played in 1895, between two teams of factory workers. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the early 1900s that the sport began to gain recognition and popularity. The Women&#x27;s Football Association (WFA) Cup Final, a major tournament in the country, was first held in 1971, marking a significant milestone in the growth of women&#x27;s football. By the 1980s, the sport had become increasingly popular, with thousands of players and fans participating and supporting the teams. Despite the progress made in the early days of women&#x27;s football in the United Kingdom, the sport faced numerous obstacles, including discrimination and a lack of funding. Early on, women&#x27;s teams were not permitted to play on the same fields as men&#x27;s teams and were often relegated to playing on makeshift pitches or public parks. Furthermore, women&#x27;s teams were not provided with the same resources and support as men&#x27;s teams, making it difficult for them to reach a competitive level. 

Despite facing discrimination and lack of funding in the past, women&#x27;s football in the United Kingdom has seen a significant growth in popularity and success over the years. Today, the sport boasts a large following with over 150,000 registered female players and has gained significant media coverage and sponsorship. The England women&#x27;s national team has also made a mark on the international stage, with notable achievements such as winning the Women&#x27;s Euros in 1984 and reaching the semi-final of the Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2019. This showcases the progress and dedication towards the development of women&#x27;s football in the United Kingdom.

Similar to in men&#x27;s football, international women&#x27;s football is played in separate Home Nations teams of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Again, the only exception to this is during the Summer Olympics where the United Kingdom is represented by Great Britain women&#x27;s Olympic football team, which again includes Northern Ireland.

===United Kingdom Olympic history===

Women&#x27;s football began in the Summer Olympics at Atlanta 1996. Unlike men&#x27;s football, women&#x27;s football at the Olympics is played at full senior level. The Great Britain Women have historically not competed at football in the Summer Olympics for the same reason as the men&#x27;s team.

Again, an exception to this was the 2012 Summer Olympics, which Great Britain were hosts. This meant that Great Britain qualified, by right of being host nation, for the football tournaments. The team was approved to play in the tournament via the same process as the men&#x27;s with England being granted permission to play under the name &quot;Great Britain&quot;. Despite this, two Scottish players for the women&#x27;s team, which saw Great Britain reach the quarter-finals. The success at London 2012 gave hope for a unified team to complete at Rio 2016 but no agreement between the four football associations could be reached. However it was agreed that a women&#x27;s team could compete in the Tokyo 2020 edition of the Olympics.

===League systems===


There are separate club football league systems for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland though some clubs play outside their country&#x27;s respective system for mainly logistical reasons. Wales did not get a national league until 1992 (though regional leagues existed prior to that), which explains why the top four Welsh clubs play in what is now regarded as the English system.

The English football league system includes hundreds of interlinked leagues, consisting of thousands of divisions. The Premier League is at the top, followed by the English Football League and then the National League, where the structure starts to become regional and includes the Northern Premier League, the Southern League, the Isthmian League and many more besides. The Welsh clubs of Cardiff City, Merthyr Town, Newport County, Swansea City and Wrexham play in the English system. Chester, a phoenix club who replaced the original Chester City, play at a stadium that straddles the English-Welsh border, with the club offices in England but the pitch located in Wales.

The Northern Ireland football league system includes the IFA Premiership. One Northern Irish club, Derry City, plays its football outside of the UK in the Republic of Ireland football league system.

The Scottish football league system similarly operates on a pyramid basis. Forty-two clubs compete in the Scottish Professional Football League, which is split into four divisions. Below that there are regional leagues, the Highland Football League, and the Lowland Football League above the East of Scotland Football League, South of Scotland Football League and the West of Scotland Football League. Two English clubs, Berwick Rangers and Tweedmouth Rangers, play in the Scottish system. Outside of the pyramid is one senior league, the North Caledonian Football League, Junior football and amateur football.

The Welsh football league system includes the Cymru Premier (historically the Welsh Premier League) at the top level, the Cymru North and Cymru South at tier two, and a number of more regional leagues below these. Premiership club The New Saints began playing their home matches on the English side of the border in Oswestry in 2007. Historically, the Saints represented the small Welsh village of Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, but merged with Oswestry Town, which had historically played in the Welsh football system, in 2003.

===Cup competitions===
There is a multitude of knockout club cup competitions. Again, these are organised on an English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish basis. Many carry qualification for the UEFA Europa League for the winners.

Each football association runs its own national cup, the FA Cup in England, the Scottish Cup in Scotland, the Welsh Cup in Wales and the Irish Cup in Northern Ireland. Traditionally, these cups have been the most liberal about whom they accept, with many teams from outside that nation (and/or league system) entering. More recently, rules have been tightened, with the competitions only open to teams who play in that nation&#x27;s football league system.

There are also a number of other cups that have more stringent requirements but carry less prestige, including the Football League Cup in England, the Scottish League Cup in Scotland, Welsh Premier League Cup in Wales and Irish League Cup in Northern Ireland. Some past cups have even crossed UK boundaries, such as the Anglo-Scottish Cup. Another cup competition that crosses the UK&#x27;s border is the current Champions Cup, which features the champions of the Northern Ireland league and the Republic&#x27;s.

===Clubs playing in other countries===
The nature of the governance of the game in the United Kingdom, with four separate associations, has led to the anomaly of clubs based in one of the four nations playing in competitions run by another. At present, this encompasses the following clubs playing senior football:
: →  - Berwick Rangers, Tweedmouth Rangers
: →  - The New Saints
: →  - Cardiff City, Merthyr Town, Newport County, Swansea City, Wrexham
: →  - Derry City

Berwick Rangers, The New Saints and Derry City are members of the association that runs the competitions in which they participate. As a consequence, Berwick is classed as a Scottish club, TNS as Welsh and Derry as Irish. This distinction is important especially where European competition is concerned, and both TNS and Derry City have represented Wales and Ireland several times in Europe. However, the Welsh clubs playing in England were more difficult to define, as, although they played almost exclusively in English competitions (with the exception of the Welsh Cup), they were members of the Football Association of Wales, leading to the question of their status. In 2008, Cardiff City reached the final of the FA Cup, which meant they would have been eligible for one of England&#x27;s places in Europe had they won. The question was only resolved in 2011, when it was decided that Welsh clubs playing in the Premier League and Football League would be subject to governance by The Football Association rather than the FAW. Clubs playing in English competitions below the Football League remain under the purview of the FAW. As of the 2023–24 season, Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County and Wrexham play in the Football League.

&quot;As of 2020&quot;
===Club meetings in Europe===

There have been several occasions when clubs from the four home nations have played each other in European competition.

===Club success in Europe===
====European Cup/UEFA Champions League====
British teams have won the European Cup sixteen times in total, behind only Spain. The UK is also the sovereign state with the most clubs to have won it: Liverpool (6), Manchester United (3), Nottingham Forest (2), Chelsea (2), Aston Villa (1) and Manchester City (1) from England (15), plus Celtic (1) from Scotland (1). British clubs have also been runners-up on eleven occasions (Liverpool (3), Manchester United (2), Celtic (1), Leeds United (1), Arsenal (1), Chelsea (1), Tottenham Hotspur (1) and Manchester City (1))

Celtic became the first British club to win the Cup in 1967, beating Italian side Inter, who had won two of the previous three finals, 2–1 in Lisbon. The first English team to win the competition was Manchester United, who defeated two-time winners Benfica of Portugal 4–1 at Wembley the following year, in 1968. English teams enjoyed the most successful period when they won the European Cup six years in a row from 1977 to 1982.

As a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, English clubs (though not those of other British associations) were banned from European competition. The ban was lifted in 1990 for all teams except Liverpool (which had taken part in the Heysel event). Liverpool returned to European competition the following year.

England is home to the Premier League, which has become one of the best and richest leagues in the world, attracting viewers from various countries around the globe. The Champions League final in 2010 was the first final in six years that did not feature an English team. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, three out of the four teams in the semi-finals were English. In May 2008 Manchester United and Chelsea played in the first ever all-English final, which Manchester United won on penalties.

====Inter-Cities Fairs Cup/UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League====
British clubs have also been successful in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with a total of ten wins in the two competitions (all English), together with twelve runners-up placings (including three Scottish).

====European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup====
The now defunct European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup has been won ten times by British clubs (including twice by Scottish clubs), with British clubs being runners-up seven times (again twice by Scottish clubs).

===Popularity===

Many Premier League clubs have a large international fanbase. Five of the top 10 most popular sports clubs on social media in the world, as of 7 February 2024, are from the United Kingdom:
==Women&#x27;s club football==
===League systems===

Women&#x27;s club football is also played in separate league systems for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The English women&#x27;s football league system also includes many interlinked leagues, consisting of thousands of divisions. The FA Women&#x27;s Super League is at the top, with the FA Women&#x27;s Championship second, and then the FA Women&#x27;s National League encompassing the third and fourth tier. Below this are various regional leagues which feed into the upper tiers.

The Northern Irish women&#x27;s football league system is headed by the IFA Women&#x27;s Premiership.

The Scottish women&#x27;s football league system similarly operates on a pyramid basis with the SWPL 1 and SWPL 2 heading the pyramid.

The Welsh women&#x27;s football league system includes the Welsh Premier Women&#x27;s Football League which was founded in 2009, in addition to various regional leagues.

===Cup competitions===

Similar to in men&#x27;s football, each FA runs their own women&#x27;s cup with the Women&#x27;s FA Cup, Scottish Women&#x27;s Cup, FAW Women&#x27;s Cup, and IFA Women&#x27;s Challenge Cup existing as national cups in the respective countries. The FA Women&#x27;s League Cup also exists in England, and the Scottish Women&#x27;s Premier League Cup, Scottish Women&#x27;s Football League First Division Cup, Scottish Women&#x27;s Football League Second Division Cup existing on Scotland.

=== The Women&#x27;s Super League (WSL) ===
The Women&#x27;s Super League (WSL) is the top professional league for women&#x27;s football in England. It was founded in 2011, and since then, it has been at the forefront of the growth and development of women&#x27;s football in the country. The Women&#x27;s Super League (WSL) in England is a professional league that has seen significant growth and success in recent years. The league has been able to attract increased media coverage, sponsorship and has adopted a summer calendar to align with men&#x27;s leagues, leading to an increase in attendance and viewership. This has resulted in the league gaining a dedicated fanbase.

The league provides a platform for the development of young talent with several teams having successful academies and youth systems, which ensures the continued success of the league. The WSL has also had a positive impact on the international stage, with several players from the league representing the England Women&#x27;s national team, which has become one of the top teams in the world. The WSL is an important part of the growth and development of women&#x27;s football in the United Kingdom, and its strong teams, dedicated fanbase, and commitment to young talent, makes it a leading force in the professionalisation of women&#x27;s football in the country.

===Coefficients of British leagues===
====UEFA====

==Stadiums==

Each of the home nations has a &quot;national stadium&quot; in which they play the majority of their home games:

* – Wembley Stadium, London (90,000)
* – Hampden Park, Glasgow ()
* – Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff (33,280)
* – Windsor Park, Belfast (15,000)

The Millennium Stadium, which has also been used for Wales home matches, is used primarily by the Welsh national rugby union team for its home internationals, while Windsor Park is a club ground owned by Linfield that the IFA leases for use by the Northern Ireland national team. In the event that the stadium is unavailable, the national team will usually play at a club ground.

These are the top twelve football stadiums in the UK by capacity (all with capacity above 50,000).
==Media==

<text>The African palm civet (Nandinia binotata), also known as the two-spotted palm civet, is a small feliform mammal widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Characteristics==

The African palm civet is grey to dark brown with dark spots on the back. It has short legs, small ears, a lean body, and a long, ringed tail. It has two sets of scent glands on the lower abdomen and between the third and fourth toes on each foot, which secrete a strong-smelling substance used to mark territory and in mating. Adult females reach a body length of with a long tail and weigh . Adult males reach in body length with a long tail and weigh .

The African palm civet&#x27;s ear canal is not divided and cartilaginous at the end.

==Distribution and habitat==
The African palm civet ranges throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa from Guinea to South Sudan, south to Angola, and into eastern Zimbabwe. It has been recorded in deciduous forests, lowland rainforests, gallery and riverine forests, savanna woodlands, and logged forests up to an elevation of .

In the 1950s, one individual was wild-caught on Bioko Island. However, it was not recorded on the island during subsequent surveys between 1986 and 2015.
In Guinea&#x27;s National Park of Upper Niger, it was recorded during surveys conducted in 1996 to 1997.
In Senegal, it was observed in 2000 in Niokolo-Koba National Park, which encompasses mainly open habitat dominated by grasses.
In Gabon&#x27;s Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, it was recorded in forested areas during a camera-trapping survey in 2012. In Batéké Plateau National Park, it was recorded only west of the Mpassa River during surveys carried out between June 2014 and May 2015. 
In Liberian Upper Guinean forests, it was sighted in Gbarpolu County and Bong County during surveys in 2013.

In Zanzibar, it was recorded in groundwater forest on Unguja Island in 2003.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The African palm civet is a nocturnal, largely arboreal mammal that spends most of the time on large branches, among lianas in the canopy of trees. It eats fruits such as those of the African corkwood tree (&quot;Musanga cecropioides&quot;), &quot;Uapaca&quot;, persimmon (&quot;Diospyros hoyleana&quot;), fig trees (&quot;Ficus&quot;), papayas (&quot;Carica papaya&quot;), and bananas (&quot;Musa&quot;).

Males have home ranges of and females of . The home range of a dominant male includes home ranges of several females.

===Reproduction===
In Gabon, females were recorded to give birth in the long wet season and at the onset of the dry season between September and January. The female usually gives birth after a gestation period of 2–3 months. A litter consists of up to four young that are suckled for around three months. While she has suckling young, the female&#x27;s mammary glands produce an orange-yellow liquid, which discolours her abdomen and the young civets&#x27; fur. This probably discourages males from mating with nursing females.
Its generation length is 7.8 years.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
In 1830, John Edward Gray first described an African palm civet using the name &quot;Viverra binotata&quot; based on a zoological specimen obtained from a museum in Leiden.

In 1843, Gray proposed the genus &quot;Nandinia&quot; and subordinated &quot;Viverra binotata&quot; to this genus.

In 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock proposed the family Nandiniidae, with the genus &quot;Nandinia&quot; as sole member. He argued that it differs from the Aeluroidea by the structure and shape of its ear canal and mastoid part of the temporal bone.

Results of morphological and molecular genetic analyses indicate that it differs from viverrids and diverged from the Feliformia about , It is the most genetically isolated Carnivoran, being the only species within its superfamily as a whole.

===Phylogenetic tree===
The phylogenetic relationships of African palm civet is shown in the following cladogram:
==Threats==
The African palm civet is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat.
In 2006, an estimated more than 4,300 African palm civets are hunted yearly in the Nigerian part and around 3,300 in the Cameroon part of the Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests.

In Guinea, dead African palm civets were recorded in spring 1997 on bushmeat market in villages located in the vicinity of the National Park of Upper Niger. Dried heads of African palm civets were found in 2007 at the Bohicon and Dantokpa Markets in southern Benin, suggesting that they are used as fetish in animal rituals.
The attitude of rural people in Ghana towards African palm civets is hostile; they consider them a menace to their food resources and safety of children. In Gabon, it is among the most frequently found small carnivores for sale in bushmeat markets. Upper Guinean forests in Liberia are considered a biodiversity hotspot. They have already been fragmented into two blocks. Large tracts are threatened by commercial logging and mining activities, and are converted for agricultural use including large-scale oil palm plantations in concessions obtained by a foreign company.

==Geography==
The town centre lies at the base of a gentle dip in the chalk hills of the Newmarket Ridge; running through the town is Stour Brook, which goes on to join the River Stour just outside the town. Rapid expansion of the town over the last two decades means that the western edge of Haverhill now includes the hamlet of Hanchet End. The surrounding countryside largely consists of arable land.

==History==
Haverhill dates back to at least Anglo-Saxon times, and the town&#x27;s market is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086). Whilst most of its historical buildings were lost to the great fire on 14 June 1667, one notable Tudor-era house remains (reportedly given to Anne of Cleves as part of her divorce from Henry VIII and thus titled &quot;Anne of Cleves House&quot;) as well as many interesting Victorian buildings. The Corn Exchange was designed by Frank Whitmore and completed in 1889.

Following a planning review in 1956, Haverhill was targeted for expansion. This was primarily to resettle communities from London which had been devastated during the Second World War. As part of this plan, new housing settlements and new factories were built. A later review in 1962 planned for a threefold increase in population from the then population of 5,446.

This influx of people changed many aspects of life in Haverhill. The expansion was not without friction. Residents who moved to the newly developed areas complained about the housing density and lack of amenities in a 1968 &quot;Man Alive&quot; documentary.

Nowadays, Haverhill is predominantly a modern and young town. The relatively small town centre is surrounded by many large housing developments, completed at various periods between the 1950s and the present.

In 1894 Haverhill became an urban district which became part of the administrative county of West Suffolk in 1889, the district contained the parish of Haverhill. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of St Edmundsbury district in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. No successor parish was formed so it became unparished. On 1 April 1989 Haverhill was parished. In 2019 Haverhill became part of West Suffolk district.

Haverhill Police Station was built in 1976 and the town also formerly had a Magistrates Court. Haverhill Police is part of the Western Area command unit of Suffolk Constabulary.

==Economy==
Haverhill&#x27;s economy is dominated by industry, and a large industrial area on the southern side of the town is home to a large number of manufacturing companies. Scientific firms including [EuroAPI] and Sigma-Aldrich have plants in the town, as do International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, and some waste processing, transport and construction firms. A Research Park has also been built, which includes The EpiCentre innovation and conference centre alongside the bypass.

A weekly market is held on Fridays on the Market Square and on Saturday the market is on the High Street.

==Sport and leisure==

Haverhill has two Non-League football clubs, Haverhill Rovers F.C. and Haverhill Borough F.C., who both play in the Eastern Counties Football League. The two clubs share the New Croft ground. The town also has a tennis club which is affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association. Other sporting clubs in the town include a cricket club, a rugby club, and an angling club. Since 2013 Haverhill has also been home to Suffolk&#x27;s only baseball team, Haverhill Blackjacks, who play in the British Baseball Federation Single-A South league, and who also play their home games at the New Croft.

There are various sporting activities available in Haverhill, including a leisure centre (with swimming pool, gym and a children&#x27;s soft play area, Kid City), an 18-hole golf course, a dance school, and a skate park.

Haverhill Arts Centre is housed within the grade II listed town hall, and features a cinema as well as hosting live music, drama, dance and comedy. A 5-screen multiplex cinema complex was opened in October 2008. From 2007 to 2013 the town was home to The Centre for Computing History, a computer museum established to tell the story of the Information Age.

==Transport==

===Buses===
Local bus services are provided by Stagecoach East: route 13 from Cambridge runs approximately every 30 minutes during the day, every 60 minutes evenings and Sundays, along with a supplementary peak-hour express route X13. The bus station in Haverhill also provides local services to some of the surrounding towns and villages.

=== Road ===
The A1307 road is the only major road that connects Haverhill to Cambridge; it also connects the town with the A11, A14 and the M11 motorway. This route experiences congestion with commuter traffic most mornings and evenings.
The A1307 is classified as a very high risk of casualty route. A proposal exists to develop the route whereby a new dual carriageway would be built from Haverhill to Cambridge, keeping the original road open as a feeder road and local bus stop route. 

=== Railway ===
The town no longer has a railway station; it is one of the largest towns in England, and the largest town in Suffolk, without one. It once had two railway stations and two interconnected railways. The Stour Valley Railway ran from to and beyond, via Haverhill North; the Colne Valley and Halstead Railway ran from to , via Castle Hedingham and . Both stations have since been demolished, but many bridges, cuttings and embankments are still visible in the Haverhill area. 

&quot;Rail Haverhill&quot;, formerly &quot;Cambridge to Sudbury Rail Renewal Association&quot;, is leading a campaign to re-open the railway between Haverhill and Cambridge; as of 2022, a feasibility study is underway.

=== Air ===
For national and international flights, Haverhill is close to London Stansted Airport, which lies approximately to the south.

==Culture==
In 2000–01 two thousand inhabitants of Haverhill were photographed and morphed into a single image by the artist Chris Dorley-Brown. The resulting image was displayed in the National Portrait Gallery. This was the biggest photographic morphing project of its kind.

In November 2004, Haverhill made a claim for a world first, becoming the only known town to feature a laser-lit sculpture on a roundabout. The high steel sculpture, called the Spirit of Enterprise (or by locals as &quot;the bog roll&quot;), is situated on the main gateway roundabout on the west side of town, and was mostly funded by local businesses.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either the Sudbury or Sandy Heath TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Suffolk, Heart East, Nation Radio Suffolk, and Star Radio which broadcast from its studio in Cambridge. 

The town is served by the local newspapers, Haverhill Echo and East Anglian Daily Times. 

==Schools==
In Haverhill, there were two academies, Samuel Ward Trust (Samuel Ward, Clements, Coupals, Westfield And Churchill Special Free School) and Castle Partnership (Burton End Primary Academy, Place Farm Primary Academy and Castle Manor Academy). There is also an independent school known as Broadlands Hall School. These have now merged into the Samuel Ward Academy Trust, and subsequently into the Unity Schools Partnership with 14 other schools. St Felix Roman Catholic Primary School is part of the Our Lady of Walsingham Multi Academy Trust.

==Notable residents==

Nathaniel Ward, the author of the first constitution in North America, was born in Haverhill in 1578. A local school is named after Nathaniel&#x27;s brother Samuel. Cambridge United footballer Michael Morrison attended Castle Manor Academy.

<text>Krishna Raja Sagara, also popularly known as KRS, is a lake and the dam that creates it. They are close to the settlement of Krishna Raja Sagara in the Indian State of Karnataka. The gravity dam made of &quot;surki&quot; mortar is below the confluence of river Kaveri with its tributaries Hemavati and Lakshmana Tirtha, in the district of Mandya.

Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV Maharaj of Mysore constructed the dam during the famine despite the critical financial condition of State. It was after him that the dam was named.
There is an ornamental garden, Brindavan Gardens, attached to the dam.

==Background==
The region of Mysore and especially Mandya had historically been dry and had witnessed mass migration to adjoining areas in the hot summers. A severe drought in 1875–76 partly due to the British Government in India had wiped out one-fifth of the population of the Kingdom of Mysore. Crop failures were common due to a lack of water for irrigation. The Kaveri river was seen as a potential source of irrigation water for the farmers in and around Mysore in the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore.

===Survey and plan===
The Chief Engineer of Mysore, Sir. M. Visvesvaraya, faced opposition from the finance ministry of the government of Mysore, who said the project would &quot;serve no purpose&quot; and that the electricity produced from it would not be of complete use due to lack of demand. He then approached T. Ananda Rao, the Diwan of Mysore and the Maharaja Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV for a reconsideration. Upon examining, the latter gave his consent issuing an order on 11 October 1911 to begin the project and a sum of 81 lakh was set aside for it. Madras Presidency then opposed the project and urged the imperial government not to approve it. Upon Visvesvaraya&#x27;s persuasion, the government consented. However, the initial plan to build a dam 194-feet high to hold an estimated of water had to be dropped.

===Construction===
Construction began in November 1911, and 10,000 workers were employed. A mortar known as &quot;surki&quot; was used in place of cement, as the latter was not manufactured in India at the time and importing would prove costly for the state. By the time construction was completed in 1931, around 5,000 to 10,000 persons had lost their homes to the project. However, they were rehabilitated and provided with agricultural land in the adjacent areas by the government.
The head priest Hindupur Panduranga Rao presided over the inauguration ceremony.

==Operation==
In place of spillways that prevent over-topping of dams, Visvesvaraya employed 48 automatic gates that open and close at the rise and fall of water in the reservoir, in six sets, with eight in each. Each gate consists of a sill, lintel, and side grooves and plates; balance weight; float; chains and pulleys; and inlet and outlet pipes. The gates are made of cast iron and were manufactured at the Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Plant in Bhadravati.

The eight sets of gates are connected by means of chains and pulleys to a dead weight, which in turn is connected to a float, making up the &#x27;balance weight&#x27; together, working inside a masonry well, both on the rear of the dam. The deadweight and float are placed one behind the other so as to have four gates on each side of it. When all eight gates close the sluice, the balance weight moves to the top of its swing and floats to the bottom of the well. The well has an inlet pipe in diameter from the reservoir that allows water in when the reservoir reaches the maximum permissible level causing the float to rise, and the balance weight to fall pulling the gates up and allowing discharge of water. In the same mechanism, the well gets emptied through an exit pipe when the water level in the reservoir falls.

==Dam==
Foundation Stone to dam was laid on 11 November 1911. The dam was built across the river Kaveri in 1924. It is the main source of water for the districts of Mysore. The water is used for irrigation in Mysore and Mandya, and it is the main source of drinking water for all of Mysore, Mandya and almost the whole of Bengaluru city, the capital of Karnataka. The water released from this dam flows into the state of Tamil Nadu and is stored in Mettur dam in the Salem district.

==Brindavan Gardens==

The Brindavan Gardens is a show garden that has a botanical park, with fountains, as well as boat rides beneath the dam. Brindavan gardens were built by Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.It was designed by German botanist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel.

Diwan Sir Mirza Ismail of Mysore planned and built the gardens in connection with the construction of the dam.(citation needed) KRS Dam was the first to install automated Crest gates during 1920, which was initiated by Sir. Erwin who was British chief engineer. Display items include a musical fountain. Various biological research departments are housed here.

==Flora and fauna==

The landscape of the area represents a complexity of agricultural land, rural habitation, sparingly spread trees and patches of original vegetation at the close by Ranganathittu Wildlife Sanctuary, which attracts wide varieties of local and migrant birds. Nearly 220 species of birds have been recorded here in large numbers.

<text>Northerly Island (also Northerly Island Park) is a human-made peninsula and park located on Chicago&#x27;s Lake Michigan lakefront. Originally constructed in 1925, Northerly Island was the former site of the Century of Progress world&#x27;s fair and later Meigs Field airport and, since Meigs Field&#x27;s closure, has been a recreational area part of Chicago&#x27;s Museum Campus. It is the site of the Adler Planetarium, the Huntington Bank Pavilion (a semi-temporary concert venue), the Northerly Island Natural Area, the 12th Street Beach and numerous art installations. Per its name, Northerly Island was constructed as an island, but is connected to the lakefront by a causeway at the northern end carrying Solidarity Drive to the planetarium.

Solidarity Drive is dominated by Neoclassical sculptures of Tadeusz Kościuszko, Karel Havlíček Borovský and Copernicus.

==History==
The initial plans that led to the construction of Northerly Island were inspired by the 1893 Columbian Exposition, which saw the significant expansion of Jackson Park. Following that success, in 1894 the South Park Commission proposed improvements to the lakefront from Jackson Park to Grant Park that led to an 1896 plan to connect the two parks with a new outer belt of parks enclosing a shoreline lagoon.

Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 &quot;Plan of Chicago&quot; renewed the call for the creation of a chain of lakefront parks between Jackson Park and 12th Street. Northerly Island was the only lakefront structure to be built based on that Plan. Northerly Island forms the southern end of Chicago Harbor, and the eastern boundary of Burnham Harbor. As indicated by the color green on the original plan, the island was to be populated by trees and grass for the public enjoyment. Daniel Burnham died in 1912. By 1916, Edward H. Bennett, co-author of the Plan of Chicago, wrote that a lakefront location would be most suitable for an airport serving the central business district. By 1922, Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson recommended locating the downtown airport at Northerly Island.
Work on the island began in 1920 when Chicago voters approved a $20 million bond issue to create Northerly Island, with construction completed by 1925.

A short time later in 1930, the Adler Planetarium was built; and in 1933–34 the island was at the center of festivities at the &quot;Century of Progress&quot; World&#x27;s Fair. Taking part in the Century of Progress Exposition, 24 Italian Savoia-Marchetti S55X flying boats, under the command of General Italo Balbo, make the first transatlantic formation flight between Italy and Chicago. Only flying boats could be used because Chicago did not yet have a suitable nearby airport, except for Grant Park, which was occasionally used as a landing strip.

Local publishing mogul Merrill C. Meigs supported earlier recommendations for converting Northerly Island into an airport, but construction did not begin for numerous reasons, such as lack of funds during the Great Depression and WWII. Construction did not begin until after a competing proposal to host the United Nations Headquarters on the island was lost in 1946. The Works Progress Administration connected the island to the mainland via a causeway at 12th Street in 1938. During this period Northerly Island was full of paths and walkways as well as a beach at 12th Street.

===Transformation from an airport into a park===
In 1994, Mayor Richard M. Daley announced plans to close the airport and build a park in its place. In 1996, the Chicago Park District, which owned Northerly Island, refused to renew the airport lease. The city briefly closed the airport from the expiration of the lease in October 1996 through February 1997 when pressure from the state legislature persuaded them to reopen the airport.

Ultimately on the night of March 30, 2003, Mayor Daley ordered city crews to make the runway unusable by bulldozing large X-shaped gouges into the runway surface in the middle of the night.

Daley defended his actions by claiming it would save the City of Chicago the effort of further court battles before the airport could close. He claimed that safety concerns required the closure, due to the post-September 11 risk of terrorist-controlled aircraft attacking the downtown waterfront near Meigs Field.

While aviation interests and commentators decried the move, supporters of the park believe it was in the city&#x27;s best interest for the land to be a park.

In 2005, an outdoor concert venue opened on the northern part of Northerly Island. Originally named Charter One Pavilion, it was expanded in 2013 and renamed to First Merit Bank Pavilion, and as of January 2017 it is named Huntington Bank Pavilion.

In December 2010, the Chicago Park District unveiled its framework plan for Northerly Island, to be completed over the next 20–30 years. The planned park would provide a variety of uses year-round with ecology and education central themes. A reef would be built, and the park would be designated into zones of &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; relating to the amount of human activity.

In 2015, a 40-acre park opened on the southern part of the island. The park features a concrete trail for walking and bicycle riding, a lagoon, and landscaped wildlife habitats.

==Today==

Northerly Island&#x27;s nature preserve is meant to revitalize the environment that was originally there. The new park is now home to migratory birds and natural wildlife. To protect its new inhabitants, dogs are not allowed on the park.

The mile of paved paths has no lighting to create as natural of an environment as possible. The park is open until 11:00 PM, and it is advised by park security to bring a flashlight.

The park is home to many of Illinois&#x27; natural wildlife, including monarch butterflies and herons. The park&#x27;s 5-acre lagoon welcomes many kinds of animals. To make the park as inviting to these animals as possible, over 11,000 shrubs and 400 trees were planted.

The creation of the lagoon led to considerable weakening of the eastern shore of Northerly Island. Stones were piled high enough to hamper the view of Lake Michigan. Erosion continued, destroying and closing most of the east side trail. The city has plans for repairs but no timetable. 

==Events and activities==

===The Great Chicago Fire Festival===
On September 26, 2015, the closing ceremonies of the second annual Great Chicago Fire Festival were held on Northerly Island after the festival was moved from its original location on the Chicago Riverfront in 2014. This event is put on by Redmoon Theater in conjunction with the City of Chicago and Chicago Park District and is meant to commemorate the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The closing ceremony includes a dramatic burning of the &quot;GRIT House,&quot; food concessions, performance stages, and a dramatic fireworks finale, among other things.

===Community events===
The Chicago Park District hosts many events on Northerly Island to allow individuals and families to take advantage of all the natural area the park has to offer.

====Polar Adventure Days====
During the winter months, the Chicago Park District hosts Polar Adventure Days, allowing parents to bring their children and experience nature in ways that would normally not be possible for those living in a city environment. On these Polar Adventure Days, the Park District offers free snowshoe rental (when there are 3 or more inches of snow) and cross country skiing, as well as a host of indoor activities in the Northerly Island Visitors Center.

<text>Luís Boa Morte Pereira (; born 4 August 1977) is a Portuguese football coach and a former professional football player who played as an attacking winger, forward and centre midfielder. He is currently head coach of Guinea-Bissau.

Having come through the youth ranks with Sporting CP, Boa Morte joined Premier League side Arsenal in 1997. He went on to play in England&#x27;s top flight for Southampton, Fulham and West Ham United. He was released in 2011 and joined Greek side Larissa before moving on to South African club Orlando Pirates. In October 2012, he returned to England and joined fourth-tier side Chesterfield.

Part of the Portugal national team from 2001 to 2009, Boa Morte earned 28 caps for Portugal. He was selected for the 2004 Olympics and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==

===Sporting CP===
Born in Lisbon to parents from São Tomé and Príncipe, Boa Morte started his professional career with Sporting CP.

===Arsenal===
Boa Morte made his debut in English football for Arsenal when he became one of Arsène Wenger&#x27;s first signings for the club, joining for a fee of £1.75 million.

He made his debut on 23 August 1997 as a substitute against Southampton. During Arsenal&#x27;s double winning 1997–98 season, he made 15 league appearances, mostly as substitute and four in the FA Cup, although he did not appear in the final itself. He scored two goals this season, with both coming in a League Cup tie against Birmingham City.

The following season, he was a fairly regular squad member, usually as substitute in the early part of the season, with a few European Cup appearances, including against Panathinaikos on 9 December 1998, when he scored Arsenal&#x27;s third goal. His fourth and final Arsenal goal came against Preston North End in the FA Cup. He came on as a substitute as Arsenal won the 1999 FA Charity Shield. His final appearance for Arsenal was as a second-half substitute away to Sunderland on 14 August 1999.

===Southampton===
In his season at The Dell, he made a total of 17 appearances, mostly as substitute, with one goal – a thundering left foot drive at Watford in a 2–3 defeat on 28 December 1999.

===Fulham===

In his first season at Fulham, he helped Jean Tigana&#x27;s side win the 2000–01 Division 1 title, making 39 league appearances and scoring 18 goals as Fulham ran away with the Championship with a total of 101 points. His contributions to the championship-winning season resulted in him being signed permanently in June 2001 (on a fee of £1.7 million paid to Arsenal), despite Southampton&#x27;s attempts to bring him back after the expiry of the loan arrangement.

In Fulham&#x27;s first two seasons in the Premiership, he was not able to replicate his form of the Championship-winning season, scoring only three goals, although his form returned to some extent in 2003–04, since when he averaged eight goals per season. He gave away all of his kit to the fans on the last game of the season, including his shorts. He was also voted Player of the Season for 2004–05 and got the nickname &quot;Dead Snake&quot; as joking mistranslation of his surname.

Boa Morte accused Everton forward Duncan Ferguson of racial abuse after an FA Cup fourth round match in January 2004. The accusation was dismissed by the Football Association, who found insufficient evidence.

In August 2005, Boa Morte was made team captain. On 19 March 2006, he scored the only goal in the 1–0 win over league leaders and reigning champions Chelsea in the West London derby at Craven Cottage; it was Fulham&#x27;s first win over their neighbours since 1979.

He became a favourite amongst Fulham&#x27;s supporters whilst he played for them, for his impassioned, never-say-die and sometimes aggressive style of play – although this led to problems with referees. Even though his form dipped towards the end of his Fulham career, he was considered something of a cult hero there due to his ability to take players on, his ability to &quot;cause panic like an unpinned grenade in the opposition ranks&quot;, and his &quot;emotional character, a trait that strengthened the bond between him and the fans&quot;.

===West Ham United===

Boa Morte signed for West Ham United in January 2007 on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee, which was believed to be around £5 million.

He played his first game for the Hammers in an FA Cup tie against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, setting up two goals and on 13 January 2007 in the Premier League against former team Fulham. On 28 April 2007, he scored his first goal for the club in an important 3–0 win against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium. On 29 July 2009, Boa Morte picked up a serious injury in the pre-season friendly against Tottenham Hotspur. West Ham were playing in the Premier League Asia Trophy in Beijing when Boa Morte got his studs stuck in the ground, twisted his knee and suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Boa Morte made his comeback from injury on 13 April 2010, playing 45 minutes in a reserve team 4–1 defeat by Wolves reserves. Making an appearance in the first team for the first time since the end of 2008–09 season he opened the scoring for West Ham against Manchester City in a 1–1 draw on 9 May 2010. It was his first goal for West Ham for over three years. In June 2010, West Ham Chairman David Sullivan announced that Boa Morte had been offered a new deal as his contract was due to finish at the end of the 2009–10 season. On 17 June 2010, Boa Morte signed a new two-year contract saying that he was looking forward to working with new West Ham manager, Avram Grant for the next two seasons. In August 2011 Boa Morte&#x27;s contract with West Ham was cancelled by mutual consent.

===AEL===
In August 2011 Boa Morte signed a two-year contract with AEL. He thus rejoined former coach Chris Coleman whom he worked with over four years at Fulham. Luis Boa Morte signaled his intent to help Larissa back to top flight football in Greece. He provided his first assist in an impressive 3–0 away win over Veria on 20 November 2011. However, he left in January 2012, just six months into his stay, due to financial problems at the club. He was immediately linked with moves to South African Premier League sides Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs.

===Orlando Pirates===
On 24 January 2012, it was confirmed by Orlando Pirates boss Irvin Khoza that Boa Morte had signed an 18-month deal. He made only two starts for Pirates and left the club on 14 May.

Boa Morte joined Football League One team Portsmouth on trial on 27 September 2012, along with Ákos Buzsáky.

===Chesterfield===
On 10 October 2012, Boa Morte signed for League Two side Chesterfield. He commented &quot;The most important thing for me now is to play football,&quot; and confirming the initial length of his contract added &quot;I&#x27;ll be here until the end of January but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t stay until the end of the season.&quot; The move followed a chance meeting with former Fulham teammate Mark Crossley who was a coach with the club. His contract was not renewed in January 2013 and he left the club.

In August 2013, Boa Morte joined Four Marks, ranked bottom in the Hampshire Premier League in the 11th tier of the English football league system. He knew their manager, who used to run security at Fulham.

==International career==
Boa Morte made his debut for the Portugal national football team on 25 April 2001 in a friendly 4–0 defeat away to World and European champions France, as an 87th-minute substitute for Rui Jorge. His only goal came in a 5–1 home win against Angola on 14 November that year, a game which had to be abandoned when the African team were reduced to six players on the pitch.

Boa Morte was not selected by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari for UEFA Euro 2004. His former Fulham teammate Louis Saha publicly called the omission &quot;revolting and scandalous&quot;, and advised Boa Morte never to play for Portugal again. Later that year, he was included in the under-23 team for the Olympic tournament in Greece in which they came bottom of their group. He was sent off early in the second half of a 4–2 loss to Iraq for a kick at Bassim Abbas, in a match that received widespread media coverage due to the ongoing war in the opponents&#x27; nation. 

Boa Morte was part of Scolari&#x27;s team that came fourth at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, playing ten minutes in place of captain Luís Figo at the end of a 2–1 win over Mexico in the final group game. After an absence of three years, he was recalled by Carlos Queiroz on 29 May 2009. He earned his first cap since 2006 on 6 June in a 2–1 win in Tirana against Albania in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. He made 27 appearances, scoring once, for Portugal from 2001 to 2009.

==Coaching career==

After retiring, Boa Morte immediately spent time assisting the coaches at the Fulham academy. In the summer 2014, Boa Morte was appointed assistant manager of Sporting CP B, the reserve team of Sporting CP. After three months, he was appointed manager of the club&#x27;s U19s. He was in charge until the end of the season, where he moved to Arsenal and worked as a scout. He left Arsenal in February 2017, to become manager of Sintrense.

In June 2018, he was appointed manager of Portimonense&#x27;s U23 squad. He left the position to become assistant manager of Maccabi Haifa on 15 January 2019.

In June 2019, Boa Morte was appointed as assistant manager to compatriot Marco Silva at Everton. He was sacked, along with Silva, in December.

Following Silva&#x27;s appointment as manager at Fulham in July 2021, Boa Morte joined him as first team coach. On 19 March 2024, it was announced that Boa Morte would be leaving Fulham at the end of the season to take up the role as manager of Guinea-Bissau.
His first game in charge, on 6 June 2024 resulted in a goalless draw against Ethiopia.

==Personal life==
Boa Morte made a guest appearance as himself in a February 1999 episode of the BBC children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, giving out prizes at a school sports day. He appeared on the MTV reality series &quot;Cribs&quot;, showing viewers a relatively modest detached house in Surrey and his Vauxhall Corsa; he said that he had never been in his own garden.

Boa Morte&#x27;s nephew Aylton (born 1993) is also a professional footballer, playing as a winger.

<doc id="1053447" wikidata="Q758234" url="?curid=1053447" title="Physical attractiveness">
<text>Physical attractiveness is the degree to which a person&#x27;s physical features are considered aesthetically pleasing or beautiful. The term often implies sexual attractiveness or desirability, but can also be distinct from either. There are many factors which influence one person&#x27;s attraction to another, with physical aspects being one of them. Physical attraction itself includes universal perceptions common to all human cultures such as facial symmetry, sociocultural dependent attributes, and personal preferences unique to a particular individual.

In many cases, humans subconsciously attribute positive characteristics, such as intelligence and honesty, to physically attractive people, a psychological phenomenon called the Halo effect. Research done in the United States and United Kingdom found that objective measures of physical attractiveness and intelligence are positively correlated, and that the association between the two attributes is stronger among men than among women. Evolutionary psychologists have tried to answer why individuals who are more physically attractive should also, on average, be more intelligent, and have put forward the notion that both general intelligence and physical attractiveness may be indicators of underlying genetic fitness. A person&#x27;s physical characteristics can signal cues to fertility and health, with statistical modeling studies showing that the facial shape variables that reflect aspects of physiological health, including body fat and blood pressure, also influence observers&#x27; perceptions of health. Attending to these factors increases reproductive success, furthering the representation of one&#x27;s genes in the population.

Heterosexual men tend to be attracted to women who have a youthful appearance and exhibit features such as a symmetrical face, full breasts, full lips, and a low waist–hip ratio. Heterosexual women tend to be attracted to men who are taller than them and who display a high degree of facial symmetry, masculine facial dimorphism, upper body strength, broad shoulders, a relatively narrow waist, and a V-shaped torso.

==General contributing factors ==

Generally, physical attractiveness can be viewed from a number of perspectives; with universal perceptions being common to all human cultures, cultural and social aspects, and individual subjective preferences. The perception of attractiveness can have a significant effect on how people are judged in terms of employment or social opportunities, friendship, sexual behaviour, and marriage.

Some physical features are attractive in both men and women, particularly bodily and facial symmetry, although one contrary report suggests that &quot;absolute flawlessness&quot; with perfect symmetry can be &quot;disturbing&quot;. Symmetry may be evolutionarily beneficial as a sign of health because asymmetry &quot;signals past illness or injury&quot;. One study suggested people were able to &quot;gauge beauty at a subliminal level&quot; by seeing only a glimpse of a picture for one-hundredth of a second. Other important factors include youthfulness, skin clarity and smoothness of skin; and &quot;vivid colour&quot; in the eyes and hair. However, there are numerous differences based on gender.

A 1921 study of the reports of college students regarding those traits argued that static traits, such as beauty or ugliness of features, hold a position subordinate to groups of physical elements like expressive behaviour, affectionate disposition, grace of manner, aristocratic bearing, social accomplishments and personal habits.

Grammer and colleagues have identified eight &quot;pillars&quot; of beauty: youthfulness, symmetry, averageness, sex-hormone markers, body odor, motion, skin complexion, and hair texture. Traditionally in Samoa, body fat was acceptable or attractive.

===Facial features===
An Italian study published in 2008 analyzed the positions of the 50 soft-tissue landmarks of the faces of 324 white Northern Italian adolescent boys and girls to compare the features of a group of 93 &quot;beautiful&quot; individuals selected by a commercial casting agency with those of a reference group with normal dentofacial dimensions and proportions. The research found that, in comparison with the reference group, the attractive adolescents tended to have the following characteristics:
* the ratio between the volume of the forehead and that of the total face was larger;
* the nasal volume was smaller;
* the distance between outer canthi was larger;
* total facial height and depth were reduced.
Some tendencies differed by age and sex:
* the facial volume was smaller in older attractive boys than in their peers, but bigger in attractive girls;
* the faces of older attractive adolescents were less rounded (bigger ratio between facial area and volume), but the reverse was true for girls of any age;
* attractive older boys had smaller angles of facial convexity with more acute profiles, while in girls the reverse pattern was found;
* the nasolabial angle was reduced in girls, but in older boys the effect was reversed;
* older attractive boys tended to have more prominent chins.
The study concluded that attractive adolescents had more neotenous and juvenile features, but older attractive boys also showed tendencies towards sexual dimorphism.

Contrary to common misconception, one study finds that non-severe facial scarring increases male attractiveness for short-term relationships.

===Symmetry===

Symmetrical faces and bodies may be signs of good inheritance to women of child-bearing age seeking to create healthy offspring. Studies suggest women are less attracted to men with asymmetrical faces, and symmetrical faces correlate with long-term mental performance and are an indication that a man has experienced &quot;fewer genetic and environmental disturbances such as diseases, toxins, malnutrition or genetic mutations&quot; while growing. Since achieving symmetry is a difficult task during human growth, requiring billions of cell reproductions while maintaining a parallel structure, achieving symmetry is a visible signal of genetic health.

Studies have also suggested that women at peak fertility were more likely to fantasize about men with greater facial symmetry, and other studies have found that male symmetry was the only factor that could significantly predict the likelihood of a woman experiencing orgasm during sex. Women with partners possessing greater symmetry reported significantly more copulatory female orgasms than were reported by women with partners possessing low symmetry, even with many potential confounding variables controlled. This finding has been found to hold across different cultures. It has been argued that masculine facial dimorphism (in men) and symmetry in faces are signals advertising genetic quality in potential mates. Low facial and body fluctuating asymmetry may indicate good health and intelligence, which are desirable features. Studies have found that women who perceive themselves as being more physically attractive are more likely to favour men with a higher degree of facial symmetry than are women who perceive themselves as being less physically attractive. It has been found that symmetrical females and males have a tendency to begin to have sexual intercourse at an earlier age, to have more sexual partners, and to have more one-night stands. They are also more likely to engage in infidelity. A study of quarterbacks in the American National Football League found a positive correlation between facial symmetry and salaries.

===Body scent===
Double-blind studies found that women prefer the scent of men who are rated as facially attractive. For example, both males and females were more attracted to the natural scent of individuals who had been rated by consensus as facially attractive. Additionally, it has also been shown that women have a preference for the scent of men with more symmetrical faces, and that women&#x27;s preference for the scent of more symmetrical men is strongest during the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle. Within the set of normally cycling women, individual women&#x27;s preference for the scent of men with high facial symmetry correlated with their probability of conception. Men&#x27;s body odor is also affected by their diet, with women expressing preferences for male body odor associated with increased dietary fruit, vegetable and protein content, and reduced carbohydrate content.

===Genetics===
Studies have explored the genetic basis behind such issues as facial symmetry and body scent and how they influence physical attraction. In one study in which women wore men&#x27;s T-shirts, researchers found that women were more attracted to the bodily scents in shirts of men who had a different type of gene section within the DNA called major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC is a large gene area within the DNA of vertebrates which encodes proteins dealing with the immune system and which influences individual bodily odors. One hypothesis is that humans are naturally attracted by the sense of smell and taste to others with &quot;dissimilar&quot; MHC sections, perhaps to avoid subsequent inbreeding while increasing the genetic diversity of offspring. Furthermore, there are studies showing that women&#x27;s natural attraction for men with dissimilar immune profiles can be distorted with use of birth control pills. Other research findings involving the genetic foundations of attraction suggest that MHC heterozygosity positively correlates with male facial attractiveness. Women judge the faces of men who are heterozygous at all three MHC loci to be more attractive than the faces of men who are homozygous at one or more of these loci. Additionally, a second experiment with genotyped women raters, found these preferences were independent of the degree of MHC similarity between the men and the female rater. With MHC heterozygosity independently seen as a genetic advantage, the results suggest that facial attractiveness in men may be a measure of genetic quality. General genetic heterozygosity has been demonstrated to be related to attractiveness in that people with mixed genetic backgrounds (i.e., mixed race people) as seen as more attractive than people with a more similar genetic parents. (i.e., single race people). However, some studies have not found that mixed race individuals are rated as more attractive, and one found that only certain mixes were rated as more attractive; this study argued that equating race with genetics was incorrect and argued for social influences as the cause.

===Youthfulness===

A 2010 study by American dating site OkCupid on 200,000 of its male and female users found that heterosexual women except those during their early to mid-twenties are open to relationships with both somewhat older and somewhat younger men; they have a larger potential dating pool than men until age 26. At age 20, women, in a &quot;dramatic change&quot;, begin sending private messages to significantly older men. At age 29, they become &quot;even more open to older men&quot;. Male desirability to women peaks in the late 20s and does not fall below the average for all men until 36. Other research indicates that women, irrespective of their own age, are attracted to men who are the same age or older.

For the Romans especially, &quot;beardlessness&quot; and &quot;smooth young bodies&quot; were considered beautiful to both men and women. For Greek and Roman men, the most desirable traits of boys were their &quot;youth&quot; and &quot;hairlessness&quot;. Pubescent boys were considered a socially appropriate object of male desire, while post-pubescent boys were considered to be &quot;ἔξωροι&quot; or &quot;past the prime&quot;. This was largely in the context of pederasty (adult male interest in adolescent boys). Today, men and women&#x27;s attitudes towards male beauty have changed. For example, body hair on men may even be preferred (see below).

A 1984 study said that gay men tend to prefer gay men of the same age as ideal partners, but there was a statistically significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) of masculinity-femininity. The study said that more feminine men tended to prefer relatively older men than themselves and more masculine men tended to prefer relatively younger men than themselves.

Cross-cultural data shows that the reproductive success of women is tied to their youth and physical attractiveness, such as the pre-industrial Sami where the most reproductively successful women were 15 years younger than their man. One study covering 37 cultures showed that, on average, a woman was 2.5 years younger than her male partner, with the age difference in Nigeria and Zambia being at the far extreme of 6.5 to 7.5 years. As men age, they tend to seek a mate who is younger.

25% of online dating website eHarmony&#x27;s male customers over the age of 50 request to only be matched with women younger than 40. The 2010 OkCupid study found that female desirability to its male users peaks at age 21, and falls below the average for all women at 31. After age 26, men have a larger potential dating pool than women on the site; and by age 48, their pool is almost twice as large. The median 31-year-old male user searches for women aged 22-to-35, while the median 42-year-old male searches for women 27-to-45. The age skew is even greater with messages to other users; the median 30-year-old male messages teenage girls as often as women his own age, while mostly ignoring women a few years older than him. Excluding the 10% most and 10% least beautiful women, women&#x27;s attractiveness does not change between 18 and 40. If extremes are included, however, &quot;there&#x27;s no doubt that younger [women] are more physically attractive – indeed in many ways beauty and youth are inextricable. That&#x27;s why most of the models you see in magazines are teenagers&quot;.

Pheromones (detected by female hormone markers) reflect female fertility and the reproductive value mean. As females age, the estrogen-to-androgen production ratio changes and results in female faces to appear more masculine (thus appearing less &quot;attractive&quot;). In a small (n=148) study performed in the United States, using male college students at one university, the mean age expressed as ideal for a wife was found to be 16.87 years old, while 17.76 was the mean ideal age for a brief sexual encounter. However, the study sets up a framework where &quot;taboos against sex with young girls&quot; are purposely diminished, and biased their sample by removing any participant over the age of 30, with a mean participant age of 19.83. In a study of penile tumescence, men were found most aroused by pictures of young adult females.

Signals of fertility in women are often also seen as signals of youth. The evolutionary perspective proposes the idea that when it comes to sexual reproduction, the minimal parental investment required by men gives them the ability and desire to simply reproduce &#x27;as much as possible.&#x27; It therefore makes sense that men are attracted to the features in women which signal youthfulness, and thus fertility. Their chances of reproductive success are much higher than they would be should they pair with someone older—and therefore less fertile.

This may explain why combating age declines in attractiveness occurs from a younger age in women than in men. For example, the removal of one&#x27;s body hair is considered a very feminine thing to do. This can be explained by the fact that aging results in raised levels of testosterone and thus, body hair growth. Shaving reverts one&#x27;s appearance to a more youthful stage and although this may not be an honest signal, men will interpret this as a reflection of increased fertile value. Research supports this, showing hairlessness is considered sexually attractive by men.

===Leg-to-body ratio===

&quot;Leg-to-body ratio&quot; is seen as an indicator of physical attractiveness but there appears to be no single accepted definition of leg-length: the &#x27;perineum-to-floor&#x27; measure is the most frequently used, but arguably the distance from the ankle bone to the outer hip bone is more rigorous. With the latter metric, the most attractive male leg-to-body ratio (judged by American women) is 1:1. A Japanese study using the former metric found the same result for male attractiveness, but women with longer legs than the rest of their body were judged to be more attractive. Excessive deviations from the mean were seen as indicative of disease. A study using Polish participants found that legs 5% longer than the average for both sexes was considered most attractive. The study concluded this preference might stem from the influence of long-legged runway models. Another study using British and American participants found &quot;mid-ranging&quot; leg-to-body ratios to be most ideal.

A study by Swami et al. of British male and female undergraduates showed a preference for men with legs as long as the rest of their body and women with 40% longer legs than the rest of their body. The researcher concluded that this preference might be influenced by American culture, in which long-legged women are portrayed as more attractive.

Marco Bertamini criticized the Swami et al. study for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which he felt would make the modified image appear unrealistic. Bertamini also criticized the Swami study for only changing the leg length while keeping the arm length constant. After accounting for these concerns in his own study, Bertamini, using stick figures, also found a preference for women with proportionately longer legs than men. When Bertamini investigated the issue of possible sexual dimorphism of leg length, he found two sources that indicated that men usually have slightly proportionately longer legs than women or that differences in leg length proportion may not exist between men and women. Following this review of existing literature on the subject, he conducted his own calculations using data from 1774 men and 2208 women. Using this data, he similarly found that men usually have slightly proportionately longer legs than women or that differences in leg length proportion may not exist between men and women. These findings made him rule out the possibility that a preference for women with proportionately longer legs than men is due proportionately longer legs being a secondary sex characteristic of women.

===Genitalia===
A 2006 study of 25,594 heterosexual men found that &quot;men who perceived themselves as having a large penis were more satisfied with their own appearance&quot;.

A 2014 study criticized previous studies based on the fact that they relied on images and used terms such as &quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;large&quot; when asking for female preference. The new study used 3D models of penises from sizes of long and in circumference to long and in circumference and let the women &quot;view and handle&quot; them. It was found that women overestimated the actual size of the penises they experimented with when asked in a follow-up survey. The study concluded that &quot;women on average preferred the penis in length both for long-term and for one-time partners. Penises with larger girth were preferred for one-time partners.&quot;

Evidence from various cultures suggests that heterosexual men tend to find the sight of women&#x27;s genitalia to be sexually arousing.

===Skin colour===
Manual labourers who spent extended periods of time outside developed a darker skin tone due to exposure to the sun. As a consequence, an association between dark skin and the lower classes developed. Light skin became an aesthetic ideal because it symbolized wealth. &quot;Over time society attached various meanings to these coloured differences. Including assumptions about a person&#x27;s race, socioeconomic class, intelligence, and physical attractiveness.&quot;

Some research has suggested that redder and yellower skin tones, reflecting higher levels of oxygenated blood, carotenoid and to a lesser extent melanin pigment, and net dietary intakes of fruit and vegetables, appear healthier, and therefore more attractive. However, there is little direct evidence that skin colour is actually related to health or immune system strength.

A historical preference for lighter-skinned women has been documented across many cultures. However, the accuracy of this research has been questioned by other authors. Experimental studies show that white Western men are more attracted to tanned women, rather than pale women, and that women themselves believe that they are more attractive with tan skin. A 2010 study found a preference for lighter-skinned (but not lightest) women in New Zealand and California. However, other research has found that African-American males and females consider medium complexion as more attractive than lighter or darker skin, while white and Hispanic women seek to tan their skin in order to increase their attractiveness to the opposite sex. There is a direct correlation between being tan and self-perceived attractiveness, especially among young women.

According to research from China, since the 2010s, tan skin has emerged as the new beauty ideal for women in China, and Chinese women themselves believe their tan skin is more attractive and healthier than pale skin. Similar findings from Japan have found that the ideal female skin colour is tan, with no spots or roughness. There is a widepread perception in Japan that White women&#x27;s skin is less beautiful than Japanese women&#x27;s, as White women are stereotyped as being too pale and roughly textured.

The relationship between attractiveness and skin colour may also intersect with ethnicity and prior experience. Skin colour preferences may shift over time, as in Western culture, where tanned skin used to be associated with the sun-exposed manual labour of the lower-class, but since the mid-20th century it has generally been considered more attractive and healthier than before, with sun tanning becoming fashionable. In the African state of Mali, skin bleaching is common as it is thought to improve one&#x27;s social standing and attractiveness to the opposite sex, although there has also been vocal opposition to this notion from pop culture icons.

Skin radiance or glowing skin may influence perception of beauty and physical attractiveness.

=== Hands ===
Hands have been found to be physically attractive. The type of hands that are physically attractive are those with longer index and ring fingers. Men have a smaller index-to-ring-finger ratio than women. The gender differences in the ratio between the index and ring fingers are said to be influenced by exposure to testosterone within the womb. In a study where participants were shown computer-based images of hands, male participants found feminine hands with a smaller index finger less attractive. Whereas females found masculine hands with a longer ring finger more attractive. The study suggests that finger length has an effect on physical attraction because it gives indication of the desirable sex-hormone dependent traits which one may possess. Another study found that averageness, healthiness of the skin, how fat the hands appear to be, and the grooming of the hands, all affect the attractiveness of hands. What is meant by averageness is the degree to which the hands look like an average of the hands in the population. Average-looking hands give an indication of an individual&#x27;s health (because there are no abnormalities). 

The healthier-looking the skin on the hands, the more attractive they appear. Reasons given for this say skin health may reflect an individual&#x27;s overall health. Healthy skin can show that someone is free from illness because some illnesses have a bad effect on the look of skin. These features are found attractive because they show that the person has good genes and is therefore a suitable mate to reproduce with. Skin health may also give an indication of socioeconomic status, as rough hands may indicate a low-paying, laborious job. Low socioeconomic status might show that someone does not have resources to provide for the offspring, and is therefore less attractive. The more fat the hands appear, the less attractive they are. This is because of the co-morbidity associated with obesity. If someone is overweight, they may have another disease, which means they may not be able to produce healthy offspring. The attractiveness of the hands also gives an indication of other features of the individual; people with more attractive hands have been found to be taller and slimmer. In most of these hand attractiveness studies, only white, European hands were used, and the participants were 18–26 years old. So, the attractiveness of non-white hands and of different age groups was not tested. Also, the people who rated the hand attractiveness were white Europeans, so their ratings may not represent how individuals of other skin colours and cultures would rate the hands.

===Height===
Females&#x27; sexual attraction towards males may be determined by the height of the man. For example, the dating site eHarmony only matches women with men taller than themselves, because of complaints from women matched with shorter men.

Other studies have shown that heterosexual women often prefer men taller than they are, rather than a man with above average height. While women usually desire men to be at least the same height as themselves or taller, several other factors also determine male attractiveness, and the &quot;taller male&quot; norm is not universal. For example, taller women are more likely to relax the &quot;taller male&quot; norm than shorter women. Furthermore, professor Adam Eyre-Walker, from the University of Sussex, has stated that there is, as yet, no evidence that these preferences are evolutionary preferences, as opposed to merely cultural preferences. Still, the cultural perceived attractiveness preferences for taller men are powerful and confirmed by multiple studies. One study of speed-daters by Stulp found that &quot;women were most likely to choose [men] 25 cm taller than themselves, whereas men were most likely to choose women only 7 cm shorter than themselves&quot;.

Additionally, women seem more receptive to an erect posture than men, though both prefer it as an element within beauty. According to one study (Yee N., 2002), gay men who identify as &quot;only tops&quot; tend to prefer shorter men, while gay men who identify as &quot;only bottoms&quot; tend to prefer taller men.

In romances in Middle English literature, all of the &quot;ideal&quot; male heroes are tall, and the vast majority of the &quot;valiant&quot; male heroes are tall too.

Most men tend to be taller than their female partners. In Western societies, it has been found that most men prefer women shorter than themselves. Nevertheless, height is a more important factor for a woman when choosing a man than it is for a man choosing a woman. Western men tend to view women taller than themselves as less attractive, and many people view heterosexual couples where the woman is taller to be less ideal. Women who are 0.7 to 1.7 standard deviations below the mean female height have been reported to be the most reproductively successful, since fewer tall women get married compared to shorter women. However, in other ethnic groups, such as the Hadza people from Tanzania, a study has found that height is irrelevant in choosing a mate. Another study found the same preference in rural Gambia.

In Middle English literature, &quot;tallness&quot; is a characteristic of ideally beautiful women. The British Fashion Model Agents Association (BFMA) says that female models should be at least tall.

===Body language===
====Standing postures====

Standing in a contrapposto posture (with bodyweight predominantly supported by one leg which is either straight, or very slightly bent, and with the other leg slightly bent) has been found to be more attractive looking than standing in a more plain, upright posture. This was found to be the case for both men and women. This posture may lower a person&#x27;s observable waist-hip ratio and make their hips look wider and their waists thinner. For women especially, this can accentuate the curvature of their figure on one side of their body and make them seem more attractive. Such poses have been used in historical sculpture to emphasize an ideal of physical beauty. It has also been demonstrated that the contrapposto posture in women elicits more neural activity in brain areas linked to perception and attractiveness assessments than a standing position.

====Movement patterns====
The way an individual moves can influence attractiveness and indicate health and age. A study reflecting the views of 700 individuals and that involved animated representations of people walking, found that the physical attractiveness of women increased by about 50 percent when they walked with a hip sway. Similarly, the perceived attractiveness of males doubled when they moved with a swagger in their shoulders.

==Male-specific factors==

Women, on average, tend to be more attracted to men who have a relatively narrow waist, a V-shaped torso, wide chest and broad shoulders. Women also tend to be more attracted to men who are taller and larger than they are, and display a high degree of facial symmetry, as well as relatively masculine facial dimorphism. Women, regardless of sexual orientation, tend to be more interested in a partner&#x27;s physical attractiveness than men.

===Sexual dimorphism===
The degree of differences between male and female anatomical traits is called sexual dimorphism. Female respondents in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle were significantly more likely to choose a masculine face than those in menses and luteal phases, (or in those taking hormonal contraception). This distinction supports the sexy son hypothesis, which posits that it is evolutionarily advantageous for women to select potential fathers who are more genetically attractive, rather than the best caregivers. However, women&#x27;s likeliness to exert effort to view male faces does not seem to depend on their masculinity, but to a general increase with women&#x27;s testosterone levels.

It is suggested that the masculinity of facial features is a reliable indication of good health, or, alternatively, that masculine-looking males are more likely to achieve high status. However, the correlation between attractive facial features and health has been questioned. Sociocultural factors, such as self-perceived attractiveness, status in a relationship and degree of gender-conformity, have been reported to play a role in female preferences for male faces. Studies have found that women who perceive themselves as physically attractive are more likely to choose men with masculine facial dimorphism, than are women who perceive themselves as physically unattractive. In men, facial masculinity significantly correlates with facial symmetry – it has been suggested that both are signals of developmental stability and genetic health. One study called into question the importance of facial masculinity in physical attractiveness in men, arguing that when perceived health, which is factored into facial masculinity, is discounted it makes little difference in physical attractiveness. In a cross-country study involving 4,794 women in their early twenties, a difference was found in women&#x27;s average &quot;masculinity preference&quot; between countries.

A study found that the same genetic factors cause facial masculinity in both males and females such that a male with a more masculine face would likely have a sister with a more masculine face due to the siblings having shared genes. The study also found that, although female faces that were more feminine were judged to be more attractive, there was no association between male facial masculinity and male facial attractiveness for female judges. With these findings, the study reasoned that if a woman were to reproduce with a man with a more masculine face, then her daughters would also inherit a more masculine face, making the daughters less attractive. The study concluded that there must be other factors that advantage the genetics for masculine male faces to offset their reproductive disadvantage in terms of &quot;health&quot;, &quot;fertility&quot; and &quot;facial attractiveness&quot; when the same genetics are present in females. The study reasoned that the &quot;selective advantage&quot; for masculine male faces must &quot;have (or had)&quot; been due to some factor that is not directly tied to female perceptions of male facial attractiveness.

In a study of 447 gay men in China, researchers said that tops preferred feminized male faces, bottoms preferred masculinized male faces and versatiles had no preference for either feminized or masculinized male faces.

In pre-modern Chinese literature, the ideal man in caizi jiaren romances was said to have &quot;rosy lips, sparkling white teeth&quot; and a &quot;jasper-like face&quot; ().

In Middle English literature, a beautiful man should have a long, broad and strong face.

===Waist-to-chest ratio===
The physique of a slim waist, broad shoulders and muscular chest are often found to be attractive to both females and males. Further research has shown that, when choosing a mate, the traits females look for indicate higher social status, such as dominance, resources, and protection. An indicator of health in males (a contributing factor to physical attractiveness) is the android fat distribution pattern which is categorized as more fat distributed on the upper body and abdomen, commonly referred to as the &quot;V shape.&quot; When asked to rate other men, both heterosexual and homosexual men found low waist-to-chest ratios (WCR) to be more attractive on other men, with the gay men showing a preference for lower WCR (more V-shaped) than the straight men.

Other researchers found waist-to-chest ratio the largest determinant of male attractiveness, with body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio not as significant.

Women focus primarily on the ratio waist to chest or more specifically waist to shoulder. This is analogous to the waist to hip ratio (WHR) that men prefer. Some studies have shown that attractive bodily traits in the eyes of a heterosexual woman would include a tall, athletic physique, with wide shoulders, and a slim waist area. Research has additionally shown that college males had a better satisfaction with their body than college females. The research also found that when a college female&#x27;s waist to hip ratio went up, their body image satisfaction decreased.

Some research has shown that body weight may have a stronger effect than WHR when it comes to perceiving attractiveness of the opposite sex. It was found that waist to hip ratio played a smaller role in body preference than body weight in regards to both sexes.

Psychologists Viren Swami and Martin J. Tovee compared female preference for male attractiveness cross culturally, between Britain and Malaysia. They found that females placed more importance on WCR (and therefore body shape) in urban areas of Britain and Malaysia, while females in rural areas placed more importance on BMI (therefore weight and body size). Both WCR and BMI are indicative of male status and ability to provide for offspring, as noted by evolutionary theory.

Females have been found to desire males that are normal weight and have the average WHR for a male. Females view these males as attractive and healthy. Males who had the average WHR but were overweight or underweight are not perceived as attractive to females. This suggests that WHR is not a major factor in male attractiveness, but a combination of body weight and a typical male WHR seem to be the most attractive. Research has shown that men who have a higher waist to hip ratio and a higher salary are perceived as more attractive to women.

===Flat abdomen===
A 1982 study found that an abdomen that protrudes was the &quot;least attractive&quot; trait for men.

In Middle English literature, a beautiful man should have a flat abdomen.

===Musculature===
Men&#x27;s bodies portrayed in magazines marketed to men are more muscular than the men&#x27;s bodies portrayed in magazines marketed to women. From this, some have concluded that men perceive a more muscular male body to be ideal, as distinct from a woman&#x27;s ideal male, which is less muscular than what men perceive to be ideal. This is due to the within-gender prestige granted by increased muscularity and within-gender competition for increased muscularity. Men perceive the attractiveness of their own musculature by how closely their bodies resemble the &quot;muscle man.&quot; This &quot;muscle man&quot; ideal is characterized by large muscular arms, especially biceps, a large muscular chest that tapers to their waist and broad shoulders. Among Australian university students, the male body composition found to be most attractive (12.16 kg fat, 63.27 kg muscle) was in line with the composition that was perceived as healthiest, and was well within the healthy range.

In a study of stated profile preferences on Match.com, a greater percentage of gay men than lesbians selected their ideal partner&#x27;s body type as &quot;Athletic and Toned&quot; as opposed to the other two options of &quot;Average&quot; or &quot;Overweight&quot;.

In pre-modern Chinese literature, such as in &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;, a type of masculinity called &quot;scholar masculinity&quot; is depicted wherein the &quot;ideal male lover&quot; is &quot;weak, vulnerable, feminine, and &quot;.

In Middle English literature, a beautiful man typically has thick, broad shoulders, a square and muscular chest, a muscular back, strong sides that taper to a small waist, large hands and arms and legs with huge muscles.

===Body hair===
Studies based in the United States, New Zealand, and China have shown that women rate men with no trunk (chest and abdominal) hair as most attractive, and that attractiveness ratings decline as hairiness increases. Another study, however, found that moderate amounts of trunk hair on men was most attractive, to the sample of British and Sri Lankan women. Further, a degree of hirsuteness (hairiness) and a waist-to-shoulder ratio of 0.6 is often preferred when combined with a muscular physique.

In a study using Finnish women, women with hairy fathers were more likely to prefer hairy men, suggesting that preference for hairy men is the result of either genetics or imprinting. Among gay men, another study reported gay males who identify as &quot;only tops&quot; prefer less hairy men, while gay males who identify as &quot;only bottoms&quot; prefer more hairy men.

=== Facial hair ===
One study shows that men with facial hair covering the cheeks, upper lip, and lower jaw were perceived as more physically attractive than men with patchy facial hair. In this study, men&#x27;s facial hair was split into four categories, each differing in the thickness and coverage: very light, light, medium, and heavy. Light facial hair was rated as the most attractive, followed by medium, heavy, and the least attractive was &#x27;very light&#x27;. This study suggests that some facial hair is better than none because it shows masculine development, as beard growth requires the conversion of testosterone. An earlier study found that women from Western and Oceanic cultures are more attracted to clean-shaven faces than beards. However, they also rated full-bearded men as having higher status than clean-shaven men.

=== Jawline ===
More angular male jawlines tend to be selected as ideal in Western countries, while the ideal female jawline is rounder and softer.

Most research shows that attractive bigonial width and Ramus measurements have similarities, but the jutting square chin is a prominently European-heritage trait which means it should not be held as a universal indicator of attractiveness. Men with low submental fat were viewed to have &quot;better jawlines&quot; and a more &quot;youthful look&quot;.

==Female-specific factors==

Research indicates that heterosexual men tend to be attracted to young and beautiful women with bodily symmetry. Rather than decreasing it, modernity has only increased the emphasis men place on women&#x27;s looks. Evolutionary psychologists attribute such attraction to an evaluation of the fertility potential in a prospective mate.

===Facial features===
====General====

Research has attempted to determine which facial features communicate attractiveness. Facial symmetry has been shown to be considered attractive in women, and men have been found to prefer full lips, high forehead, broad face, small chin, small nose, short and narrow jaw, high cheekbones, clear and smooth skin, and wide-set eyes. The shape of the face in terms of &quot;how everything hangs together&quot; is an important determinant of beauty. Women with thick, dark limbal rings in their eyes have also been found to be more attractive. The explanation given is that because the ring tends to fade with age and medical problems, a prominent limbal ring gives an honest indicator of youth.

In Persian literature, beautiful women are said to have noses like hazelnuts. In Arabian society in the Middle Ages, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have straight and fine noses.In Jewish Rabbinic literature, the rabbis considered a delicate nose to be the ideal type of nose for women. In Japan, during the Edo period, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have tall noses which were straight and not &quot;too tall&quot;.

In a cross-cultural study, more neotenized (i.e., youthful looking) female faces were found to be most attractive to men while less neotenized female faces were found to be less attractive to men, regardless of the females&#x27; actual age. In a study of Italian women who have won beauty competitions, it was found that their faces had more &quot;babyish&quot; (pedomorphic) traits than those of the &quot;normal&quot; women used as a reference.

In a cross-cultural study, Marcinkowska et al. said that 18-to-45-year-old heterosexual men in all 28 countries surveyed preferred photographs of 18-to-24-year-old white women whose faces were feminized using facial image editing software over faces of 18-to-24-year-old white women that were masculinized using that software, but there were differences in preferences for femininity across countries. The higher the National Health Index (based on eight national health statistics taken from the World Health Organization Statistical Information Service using data from 2002 to 2006) of a country, the more were the feminized faces preferred over the masculinized faces. Among the countries surveyed, Japan had the highest femininity preference and Nepal had the lowest femininity preference.

Michael R. Cunningham of the Department of Psychology at the University of Louisville found, using a panel of East Asian, Hispanic and White judges, that the female faces tended to be judged as more attractive if they had a mixture of youthful and sexually mature features. Using a panel of African Americans and Whites as judges, Cunningham found more neotenous faces were perceived as having both higher &quot;femininity&quot; and &quot;sociability&quot;. The authors found no evidence of ethnocentric bias in the Asian or White samples, as Asians and Whites did not differ significantly in preference for neonate cues, and positive ratings of White women did not increase with exposure to Western media.

Rather than finding evidence for purely &quot;neonate&quot; faces being most appealing, Cunningham found faces with &quot;sexually-mature&quot; features at the &quot;periphery&quot; of the face combined with &quot;neonate&quot; features in the &quot;centre of the face&quot; most appealing in women. Upon analyzing the results of his study, Cunningham concluded that preference for &quot;neonate features may display the least cross-cultural variability&quot; in terms of &quot;attractiveness ratings&quot; and, in another study, Cunningham concluded that there exists a large agreement on the characteristics of an attractive face.

In computer face averaging tests, women with averaged faces have been shown to be considered more attractive. This is possibly due to average features being more familiar and, therefore, more comfortable.

According to Chinese scholar Liu Jieyu (2008), there is more pressure on women than men to be physically attractive. Whereas there are various criteria that women might be expected to meet, a man might only need to be tall to be considered attractive.

On average, symmetrical features are one ideal, while unusual, stand-out features are another. A study performed by the University of Toronto found that the most attractive facial dimensions were those found in the average female face. However, that particular University of Toronto study looked only at white women.

A 2011 study, by Wilkins, Chan and Kaiser found correlations between perceived femininity and attractiveness; that is, women&#x27;s faces which were seen as more feminine were judged by both men and women to be more attractive. The study also found that East Asian women&#x27;s faces were more &quot;prototypically&quot; feminine than White women&#x27;s, a finding that was replicated by several follow-up studies which found that this explains the higher attractiveness ratings of East Asian women compared to White women.

A component of the female beauty ideal in Persian literature is for women to have faces like a full moon.

Similarly, in Arabian society in the Middle Ages, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have round faces which were like a &quot;full moon&quot;.

In Japan, during the Edo period, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have oval-shaped faces.

In Jewish Rabbinic literature, the rabbis considered full lips to be the ideal type of lips for women.

Historically, in Chinese and Japanese literature, the feminine ideal was said to include small lips. Women would paint their lips thinner and narrower to align with this ideal.

A study that used Chinese, Malay and Indian judges said that Chinese women and Chinese men with retrusive mandibles (where the mouth is flat and in-line with the rest of the face) were judged to be the most attractive and Chinese men and Chinese women with a protruding mandible (where the jaw projects outward) were judged to be the least attractive.

Classical Persian literature, paintings and miniatures portrayed traits such as long black curly hair, a small mouth, long arched eyebrows, large almond-shaped eyes, a small nose, and beauty spots as being beautiful for women.

====Eyes====

A study that investigated whether or not an eyelid crease makes Chinese-descent women more attractive using photo-manipulated photographs of young Chinese-descent women&#x27;s eyes found that the &quot;medium upper eyelid crease&quot; was considered most attractive by all three groups of both sexes: white people, Chinese and Taiwanese nationals together as a group, and Taiwanese and Chinese Americans together as a group. Similarly, all three groups of both genders found the absence of an eye crease to be least attractive on Chinese women.

In the late sixteenth century, Japanese people considered epicanthic folds to be beautiful.

A study that used Russian, American, Brazilian, Aché, and Hiwi raters, found that the only strong distinguisher between men and women&#x27;s faces was wider eyes relative to facial height for women, and this trait consistently predicted attractiveness ratings for women.

In Arabian society in the Middle Ages, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have dark black eyes which are large and long and in the shape of almonds. Furthermore, the eyes should be lustrous, and they should have long eyelashes.

A source written in 1823, said that a component of the Persian female beauty ideal was for women to have large eyes which are black in colour. In Persian literature, beautiful women are said to have eyes that are shaped like almonds.

In Chinese, the phrase &quot;lucent irises, lustrous teeth&quot; () is used to describe a beautiful woman with &quot;clear eyes&quot; and &quot;well-aligned, white teeth&quot;, and the phrase &quot;moth-feeler eyebrows&quot; () is used to denote a beautiful woman by describing her eyebrows as being thin and arched like moth antennae. In the Chinese text &quot;The Grotto of the Immortals&quot; () written during the Tang dynasty period, narrow eyes were the preferred type of eyes for women, and, in the Chinese text &quot;Jeweled Chamber Secrets&quot; () from the Six Dynasties period, the ideal woman was described as having small eyes.

The 1813 Japanese text &quot;Customs, Manners, and Fashions of the Capital&quot; () indicates that large eyes were not considered attractive in women.

===Breasts===

Research has shown that most heterosexual men enjoy the sight of female breasts, with a preference for firm breasts A study of British undergraduates found men preferred small breasts on women. Smaller breasts were widely associated with youthfulness. Cross-culturally, another study found &quot;high variability&quot; regarding the ideal breast size. 

The pigmentation of nipples and breasts appears to be the most important quality of breast attractiveness. Men rated women with dark nipples and dark areola as significantly more attractive than those with light-coloured nipples or areola. Breasts of medium cup size were found to be the most attractive, however it was noted that men focused primarily on the colouration of nipples and areola rather than breast size.

A study by Groyecka et al., in which they examined Poles and Yali of New Guinea, demonstrated that men&#x27;s judgements of breast appearance are affected by the occurrence of breast ptosis (i.e., sagginess, droopiness). Greater breast ptosis (more sagging breasts) is perceived as less attractive and attributed to a woman of older age. These findings are consistent with previous research that link breast attractiveness with female youthfulness. Unlike breast size, breast ptosis seems to be a universal marker of female breast attractiveness.

A study showed that men prefer symmetrical breasts. Breast symmetry may be particularly sensitive to developmental disturbances and the symmetry differences for breasts are large compared to other body parts. Women who have more symmetrical breasts tend to have more children.

Historical literature often includes specific features of individuals or a gender that are considered desirable. These have often become a matter of convention, and should be interpreted with caution. In Arabian society in the Middle Ages, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have small breasts. In Persian literature, beautiful women are said to have breasts like pomegranates or lemons. In the Chinese text &quot;Jeweled Chamber Secrets&quot; () from the Six Dynasties period, the ideal woman was described as having firm breasts. In Sanskrit literature, beautiful women are often said to have breasts so large that they cause the women to bend a little bit from their weight. In Middle English literature, beautiful women should have small breasts that are round like an apple or a pear.

===Buttocks===
Biological anthropologist Helen E. Fisher of the centre for Human Evolution Studies in the Department of Anthropology of Rutgers University said that, &quot;perhaps, the fleshy, rounded buttocks... attracted males during rear-entry intercourse.&quot; In a recent study, using 3D models and eye-tracking technology Fisher&#x27;s claim was tested and it was shown that the slight thrusting out of a woman&#x27;s back influences how attractive others perceive her to be and captures the gaze of both men and women. Bobbi S. Low et al. of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, said the female &quot;buttocks evolved in the context of females competing for the attention and parental commitment of powerful resource-controlling males&quot; as an &quot;honest display of fat reserves&quot; that could not be confused with another type of tissue, although T. M. Caro, professor in the centre for Population Biology and the Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology, at University of California, Davis, rejected that as being a necessary conclusion, stating that female fatty deposits on the hips improve &quot;individual fitness of the female&quot;, regardless of sexual selection. 

In a 1995 study, black men were more likely than white men to use the words &quot;big&quot; or &quot;large&quot; to describe their conception of an attractive woman&#x27;s posterior. In a 2009 experiment to research what South African, British white and British African men considered to be the most attractive size of posterior and breasts for white and black women. This image shown here only shows the two extreme variations of size on black female figures used in the experiment. The left-hand figure received the highest average attractiveness rating from South African men while a figure with an intermediate size received the highest ratings from both white and black British men. The right-hand figure did not receive the highest average attractiveness rating from any group.

===Body mass===
Body Mass Index (BMI) is an important determinant to the perception of beauty. Even though the Western ideal is for a thin woman, some cultures prefer plumper women, which has been argued to support that attraction for a particular BMI merely is a cultural artifact. The attraction for a proportionate body also influences an appeal for erect posture. One cross-cultural survey comparing body-mass preferences among 300 of the most thoroughly studied cultures in the world showed that 81% of cultures preferred a female body size that in English would be described as &quot;plump&quot;.

Availability of food influences which female body size is attractive which may have evolutionary reasons. Societies with food scarcities prefer larger female body size than societies that have plenty of food. In Western society, males who are hungry prefer a larger female body size than they do when not hungry.

BMI has been criticised for conflating fat and muscle, and more recent studies have concentrated on body composition. Among Australian university students, the most attractive body composition for women (10.31 kg fat, 42.45 kg muscle) was found to be lower in fat than both the most healthy appearing composition, and below the healthy range.

In the United States, women overestimate men&#x27;s preferences for thinness in a mate. In one study, American women were asked to choose what their ideal build was and what they thought the build most attractive to men was. Women chose slimmer than average figures for both choices. When American men were independently asked to choose the female build most attractive to them, the men chose figures of average build. This indicates that women may be misled as to how thin men prefer women to be. Some researchers believe women themselves may play a role in enforcing the thinness ideal, however they assert that this does not mean that the ideal does not ultimately trace its origins to patriarchical norms (the &quot;male gaze&quot;). Popenoe writes that societies with abundant food sources often value thin women, while those with food scarcity value women with fat bodies. In the West, women with thin bodies became the ideal in the 19th century, as the fat body became associated with criminality and backwardness. Some implicated the fashion industry for the promulgation of the notion of thinness as attractive.

East Asians have historically preferred women whose bodies had small features. For example, during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, women in Chinese harems wanted to have a thin body in order to be attractive for the Chinese emperor. Later, during the Tang dynasty, a less thin body type was seen as most attractive for Chinese women. In Arabian society in the Middle Ages, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to be slender like a &quot;cane&quot; or a &quot;twig&quot;. In the Chinese text &quot;Jeweled Chamber Secrets&quot; () from the Six Dynasties period, the ideal woman was described as not being &quot;large-boned&quot;.

In the Victorian era, women who adhered to Victorian ideals were expected to limit their food consumption to attain the ideal slim figure. In Middle English literature, &quot;slender&quot; women are considered beautiful.

According to research on females, women consider a full body with good distribution to be highly important to be considered attractive by men.

===Waist–hip ratio===

A WHR of 0.7 for women has been shown to correlate strongly with general health and fertility. Women within the 0.7 range have optimal levels of estrogen and are less susceptible to major diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and ovarian cancers. Women with high WHR (0.80 or higher) have significantly lower pregnancy rates than women with lower WHRs (0.70–0.79), independent of their BMIs. Female waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) has been proposed by evolutionary psychologists to be an important component of human male mate choice, because this trait is thought to provide a reliable cue to a woman&#x27;s reproductive value.

Both men and women judge women with smaller waist-to-hip ratios more attractive. Ethnic groups vary with regard to their ideal waist-to-hip ratio for women, ranging from 0.6 in China, to 0.8 or 0.9 in parts of South America and Africa, and divergent preferences based on ethnicity, rather than nationality, have also been noted. A study found the Machiguenga people, an isolated indigenous South American ethnic group, prefer women with high WHR (0.9). The preference for heavier women, has been interpreted to belong to societies where there is no risk of obesity.

In Chinese, the phrase &quot;willow waist&quot; () is used to denote a beautiful woman by describing her waist as being slender like a willow branch.

In the Victorian era, a small waist was considered the main trait of a beautiful woman. The term &quot;wasp waist&quot; describes an extreme fashion silhouette, produced by a style of corset and girdle.

===Feet size===
According to some studies, most men prefer women with small feet, such as in ancient China where foot binding was practiced.

In Jewish Rabbinic literature, the rabbis considered small feet to be the ideal type of feet for women.

===Hair===
Men have been found to prefer long-haired women. An evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins causes loss of hair or hair changes. Hair therefore indicates health and nutrition during the last 2–3 years. Lustrous hair is also often a cross-cultural preference.

A component of the female beauty ideal in Persian literature is for women to have black hair, which was also preferred in Arabian society in the Middle Ages. In Middle English literature, curly hair is a necessary component of a beautiful woman.

===Fertility-driven attractiveness===
There are some subtle changes in women&#x27;s perceived attractiveness across the menstrual cycle. During their most fertile phase, we can observe some changes in women&#x27;s behaviour and physiology. A study conducted by G. Miller (2007) examined the amount of tip earnings by lap dancers across the menstrual cycle. He found that dancers received nearly US$15 more when they were near ovulation than during the rest of the month. This suggests that women either are more attractive during ovulation phase, or they experience a significant change in their behaviour. Some other studies have found that there are subtle differences in women&#x27;s faces when in their fertile phase. Bobst and Lobmaier (2012) created 20 prototyped photographs, some of a female during ovulation and some during the luteal phase. Men were asked to choose the more attractive, the more caring and the more flirtatious faces. They found a significant preference for the follicular phase (ovulation). This suggests that subtle shape differences in faces occurring during the female&#x27;s ovulation phase are sufficient to attract men more. This idea is supported by another study, where a similar experiment was done. Men and women had to judge photographs of women&#x27;s faces taken during their fertile phase. They were all rated more attractive than during non-fertile phase. There are some subtle visible cues to ovulation in women&#x27;s faces, and they are perceived as more attractive, leading to the idea that it could be an adaptive mechanism to raise a female&#x27;s mate value at that specific time (when probability of conception is at its highest).

Women&#x27;s attractiveness, as perceived by men and women, slightly differs across her menstrual cycle, being at peak when she is in her ovulation phase. Jones et al. (2008), focused on women&#x27;s preferences for masculinity, apparent health and self-resemblance and found that it varies across the cycle. They explained that the function of the effects of menstrual cycle phase on preferences for apparent health and self-resemblance in faces is to increase the likelihood of pregnancy.

Similarly, females prefer the scent of symmetrically faced men and men with masculine faces during fertile phases as well as stereotypical male displays such as social presence, and direct intrasexual competitiveness.

During the follicular phase (fertile), females prefer more masculine traits (testosterone dependent traits such as face shape) than when in non-fertile phase. Those findings have been found in the voice, showing that females&#x27; preferences for more masculine voices over feminine voices increase the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.

But not only females&#x27; preferences vary across cycle, their behaviours as well. Effectively, men respond differently to females when they are on ovulatory cycle, because females act differently. Women in the ovulatory phase are flirtier with males showing genetic fitness markers than in low fertile phase. It has been shown in some studies that women high in estrogen are generally perceived to be more attractive than women with low levels of estrogen, based on women not wearing make-up. High estrogen level women may also be viewed as healthier or to have a more feminine face.

Similarly, a study investigated the capacity of women to select high quality males based on their facial attractiveness. They found that facial attractiveness correlated with semen quality (good, normal, or bad depending on sperm morphology and motility). The more attractive a man&#x27;s face is, linked to his sperm being of better quality.

===Sexual ornamentation===
Sexual ornaments are seen in many organisms; in humans, females have sexual ornamentation in the form of breasts and buttocks. The physical attraction to sexual ornaments is associated with gynoid fat, as opposed to android fat, which is considered unattractive. In human females, proximate causes of the development of sexual ornaments are associated with the predominance of estrogen in puberty. The activation of estrogen receptors around the female skeletal tissue causes gynoid fat to be deposited in the breasts, buttocks, hips and thighs, producing an overall typical female body shape. Specifically, female breasts are considered more attractive when symmetrical, rather than asymmetrical, as this is thought to reflect good developmental stability.

Sexual ornaments are considered attractive features as they are thought to indicate high mate value, fertility, and the ability to provide good care to offspring. They are sexually selected traits present for the purpose of honest signalling and capturing the visual attention of the opposite sex, most commonly associated with females capturing the visual attention of males. It has been proposed that these ornaments have evolved in order to advertise personal quality and reproductive value. Honest signalling with sexual ornaments is associated with ultimate causation of these evolved traits. The evolution of these ornaments is also associated with female-female competition in order to gain material benefits provided by resourceful and high status males. In humans, once these sexual ornaments develop, they are permanent. It is thought that this is associated with the long-term pair bonding humans engage in; human females engage in extended sexual activity outside of their fertile period. This relates to another ultimate cause of sexual ornaments with function in obtaining non-genetic material benefits from males. In other animal species, even other primate species, these advertisements of reproductive value are not permanent. Usually, it is the point at which the female is at her most fertile, she displays sexual swellings.

Adolescence is the period of time whereby humans experience puberty, and experience anatomical changes to their bodies through the increase of sex hormones released in the body. Adolescent exaggeration is the period of time at which sexual ornaments are maximised, and peak gynoid fat content is reached. In human females, the mean age for this is approximately 16 years. Female breasts develop at this stage not only to prepare for reproduction, but also due to competition with other females in displaying their reproductive value and quality to males.

== Interpersonal attraction ==

In the social psychology perspective, interpersonal attraction is when someone experiences a positive attitude or evaluation regarding a particular person having potential of being a significant other. This includes &quot;three components conventionally ascribed to attitudes: behavioural (tendency to approach the person), cognitive (positive beliefs about the person), and affective (positive feelings for the person).&quot; With these three components, psychology has created five elements of interpersonal attraction. These include proximity, similarity, physical attractiveness, reciprocity, and responsiveness.
==Neural correlates of perceiving attractiveness==
Most studies of the brain activations associated with the perception of attractiveness show photographs of faces to their participants and let them or a comparable group of people rate the attractiveness of these faces. Such studies consistently find that activity in certain parts of the orbitofrontal cortex increases with increasing attractiveness of faces. This neural response has been interpreted as a reaction on the rewarding nature of attractiveness, as similar increases in activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex can be seen in response to smiling faces and to statements of morally good actions. While most of these studies have not assessed participants of both genders or homosexual individuals, evidence from one study including male and female hetero- and homosexual individuals indicate that some of the aforementioned increases in brain activity are restricted to images of faces of the gender which participants feel sexually attracted to.

With regard to brain activation related to the perception of attractive bodies, one study with heterosexual participants suggests that activity in the nucleus accumbens and the anterior cingulate cortex increases with increasing attractiveness. The same study finds that for faces and bodies alike, the medial part of the orbitofrontal cortex responds with greater activity to both very attractive and very unattractive pictures. Recent research has found that the perception of women with lower Waist-to-Hip Ratios and larger breasts triggers distinct patterns of temporal and spatial brain activation, differing from those associated with larger WHRs and smaller breasts. Specifically, attractive WHRs and breast sizes influenced brain activity related to visual processing differently than less attractive WHRs and breast sizes, impacting both early and late stages of temporal processing in men and women. Moreover, research on upper body size shows that posterior brain regions are involved in perceiving body forms of differing attractiveness due to variations male upper body size, while frontal brain regions are engaged when these perceptions are explicitly rated. Such brain activities are unique to processing male, but not female, body sizes.

For both men and women, there appear to be universal criteria of attractiveness both within and across cultures and ethnic groups. When considering long-term relationships, some studies have found that men place a higher emphasis on physical attractiveness in a partner than women do. On the other hand, some studies have found few differences between men and women in terms of the weight they place on physical characteristics when they are choosing partners for short-term relationships, in particular with regard to their implicit, as opposed to explicitly articulated, preferences. Other recent studies continue to find sex differences for long-term relationships. While still valuing physical attractiveness, women tend to prioritize a man&#x27;s status over his physical attractiveness, while men prioritize physical attractiveness over status. There is also one study suggesting that only men, not women, place greater priority on bodily compared to facial attractiveness when looking for a short-term as compared to a long-term partner.

Some evolutionary psychologists, including David Buss, have argued that this long-term relationship difference may be a consequence of ancestral humans who selected partners based on secondary sexual characteristics, as well as general indicators of fitness which allowed for greater reproductive success as a result of higher fertility in those partners, although a male&#x27;s ability to provide resources for offspring was likely signaled less by physical features. It is argued that the most prominent indicator of fertility in women is youth, while the traits in a man which enhance reproductive success are proxies for his ability to accrue resources and protect.

Studies have shown that women pay greater attention to physical traits than they do directly to earning capability or potential to commit, including muscularity, fitness and masculinity of features; the latter preference was observed to vary during a woman&#x27;s period, with women preferring more masculine features during the late-follicular (fertile) phase of the menstrual cycle. Additionally, women process physical attractiveness differently, paying attention to both individual features and the aesthetic effect of the whole face.

According to Bonnie Adrian, Taiwanese brides place great importance on physical attractiveness for their wedding photographs. These brides go through hours of makeup to transform themselves into socially constructed beauty. Adrian notes that female beauty standards and practices in Taiwan are quite different from those found in the West. Women in Taiwan tend to avoid tanning, while Taiwanese women with tanned skin tones would be considered the ideal in the Western world.

According to strategic pluralism theory, men may have correspondingly evolved to pursue reproductive strategies that are contingent on their own physical attractiveness. More physically attractive men accrue reproductive benefits from spending more time seeking multiple mating partners and relatively less time investing in offspring. In contrast, the reproductive effort of physically less attractive men, who therefore will not have the same mating opportunities, is better allocated either to investing heavily in accruing resources, or investing in their mates and offspring and spending relatively less time seeking additional mates.

==Facial similarity and racial preferences==
Research has suggested that people give high attractiveness ratings to same-sex people who look like them, but only in a nonsexual context. On the other hand, people generally do not find similar-looking people of the opposite sex to be sexually attractive. It is theorized that people may prefer sexual partners who look different from them, which is consistent with a pattern of inbreeding avoidance. Although one study found that individuals show a preference for similar-looking mates, after a physiological stress test they preferred dis-similar looking mates.

One study found no strong evidence for a same-race preference in heterosexual people, and they note that evidence from two similar studies is conflicting. Some racial groups show a strong preference for partners of a different race or ethnicity, and this preference may be gendered. One study suggested that attraction to people with different ethnic features may be related to the effects of heterozygosity, which are thought to be a fitness advantage.

A 2012 study using British raters found that Asian women&#x27;s faces were rated as more feminine, and therefore more attractive, than White women&#x27;s, which could explain the high rate of interracial marriage with Asian women. A 2018 facial manipulation experiment conducted in Australia was consistent with these hypotheses, finding both Asian and White participants chose to reduce Asian women&#x27;s &quot;masculine&quot; facial traits less than White women&#x27;s, which the authors conclude suggests that Asian faces may be more feminine to begin with.

In contrast, a 2013 Australian study on facial attractiveness with Asian and White participants found that Asian and White women&#x27;s faces were not different in attractiveness overall, although a slight own-race bias was observed. However, when rating composite faces (the average of many faces, grouped by race, as opposed to real faces), all participants rated the composite faces more highly and rated White women&#x27;s composite faces the highest. In a follow-up experiment, the researchers found that there was no difference in Asian and White women&#x27;s perceived facial femininity.

A 2008 American study on female facial attractiveness with majority White participants (with a significant proportion of Asian, and few Black, Hispanic, or Middle-Eastern participants) found that White women&#x27;s faces were rated most attractive. The study showed gradations of computer-generated racial mixes to the participants in increments of one-quarter. The top three rated faces were 100% White, 75% White 25% Black, and 75% White 25% Asian. To the researchers&#x27; surprise, Asian women&#x27;s faces were rated significantly less attractive than White or Black faces in this study.

A 2012 study using Black and Caucasian subjects found that inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic differences in perceived male facial masculinity have no impact on attractiveness, and that skin colour plays a more important role in attractiveness assessments of male faces within groups, but not between groups as a health signal.

== Group attractiveness effect ==
The group attractiveness effect is where a group&#x27;s overall attractiveness rating is higher than the mean of each individuals&#x27; attractiveness rating. This occurs because people selectively attend to the most attractive group members and thus they get the most attention. Men selectively attend to attractive people more than women, it has been suggested that this could be because men are less invested in their offspring, so they are less choosy when it comes to sexual partners, and therefore they are more easily attracted. As a result of selective attention, people end up giving a group rating which is biased as the rating focuses mainly on the attractive members and ignores the less attractive members. So the overall attractiveness rating is skewed towards more attractive. The group attractiveness effect was investigated in a study which got participants to rate the physical attractiveness of a group of females as a whole, individually in a group, and individually on their own. Participants were asked to give a rating of 1–7, with 1 being very unattractive and 7 being very attractive. The group attractiveness effect has been replicated with males as the main group and also with a group of both males and females. This effect may not be demonstrated across all cultures because the sample only contained Dutch university students.

==Social effects==
Perceptions of physical attractiveness contribute to generalized assumptions based on those attractions. Individuals assume that when someone is beautiful, then they have many other positive attributes that make the attractive person more likeable. This is referred to as the halo effect, also known as the &#x27;beautiful-is-good&#x27; effect. Across cultures, what is beautiful is assumed to be good; attractive people are assumed to be more extroverted, popular, and happy. This could lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, as, from a young age, attractive people receive more attention that helps them develop these characteristics. In one study, beautiful people were found to be generally happier than less beautiful or plain people, perhaps because these outgoing personality traits are linked to happiness, or perhaps because beauty led to increased economic benefits which partially explained the increased happiness. In another study testing first impressions in 56 female and 17 male participants at University of British Columbia, personality traits of physically attractive people were identified more positively and more accurately than those who were less physically attractive. It was explained that people pay closer attention to those they find physically beautiful or attractive, and thus perceiving attractive individuals with greater distinctive accuracy. The study believes this accuracy to be subjective to the eye of the beholder. Recent results from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study confirmed the positive link between psychological well-being and attractiveness (higher facial attractiveness, lower BMI) and also found the complementary negative association with distress/depression. Even though connections and confounds with other variables could not be excluded, the effects of attractiveness in this study were the same size as the ones for other demographic variables.

In developed western societies, women tend to be judged for their physical appearance over their other qualities and the pressure to engage in beauty work is much higher for women than men. Beauty work is defined as various beauty &quot;practices individuals perform on themselves or others to elicit certain benefits from a specific social hierarchy.&quot; Being &quot;beautiful&quot; has individual, social and institutional rewards. Although marketers have started to target the &quot;metro-sexual&quot; male and produce hygiene and beauty products geared towards men, the expectations placed on them is less than women. The time and money required for a man to achieve the same well-groomed appearance is much lower. Even in areas that men also face pressure to perform beauty work, such as haircuts/styling, the prices discrepancy for products and services are skewed. This phenomenon is called the &quot;pink tax.&quot;

However, attractiveness varies by society; in ancient China foot binding was practiced by confining young girls&#x27; feet in tightly bound shoes to prevent the feet from growing to normal size causing the women to have an attractive &quot;lotus gait&quot;. In England, women used to wear corsets that severely constricted their breathing in order to achieve a visual effect of an exaggeratedly low waist-to-hip ratio.

People make judgments of physical attractiveness based on what they see, but also on what they know about the person. Specifically, perceptions of beauty are malleable such that information about the person&#x27;s personality traits can influence one&#x27;s assessment of another person&#x27;s physical beauty. A 2007 study had participants first rate pictures for attractiveness. After doing distracting math problems, participants saw the pictures again, but with information about the person&#x27;s personality. When participants learned that a person had positive personality characteristics (e.g., smart, funny, kind), that person was seen as more physically attractive. Conversely, a person with negative personality characteristics (e.g., materialistic, rude, untrustworthy) was seen as less physically attractive. This was true for both females and males.

Physical attractiveness can have various social effects. For instance, humans tend to self-organize into couples where both parties have loosely similar attractiveness levels as judged by third parties. A survey conducted by London Guildhall University of 11,000 people showed that those who subjectively describe themselves as physically attractive earn more income than others who would describe themselves as less attractive. People who described themselves as less attractive earned, on average, 13% less than those who described themselves as more attractive, while the penalty for being overweight was around 5%. According to further research done on the correlation between looks and earnings in men, the punishment for unattractiveness is greater than the benefits of being attractive. However, in women the punishment is found to be equal to the benefits. Another study suggests that more physically attractive people are significantly more likely on average to earn considerably higher wages. Differences in income due to attractiveness was much more pronounced for men rather than women, and held true for all ranges of income. In the US the earnings disparities along the attractiveness continuum (net of controls) are similar or greater than the black-white disparity. A study from 2020 found that social scientists who are judged as being more attractive receive higher public speaking fees than less attractive social scientists, whereas for natural scientists, relative unattractiveness is a comparative advantage in terms of public speaking fees.

It is important to note that other factors such as self-confidence may explain or influence these findings as they are based on self-reported attractiveness as opposed to any sort of objective criteria; however, as one&#x27;s self-confidence and self-esteem are largely learned from how one is regarded by their peers while maturing, even these considerations would suggest a significant role for physical appearance. One writer speculated that &quot;the distress created in women by the spread of unattainable ideals of female beauty&quot; might possibly be linked to increasing incidence of depression.

Many have asserted that certain advantages tend to come to those who are perceived as being more attractive, including the ability to get better jobs and promotions; receiving better treatment from authorities and the legal system; having more choices in romantic or platonic partners and, therefore, more power in relationships; and marrying into families with more money. Those who are attractive are treated and judged more positively than those who are considered unattractive, even by those who know them. Also, attractive individuals behave more positively than those who are unattractive. One study found that teachers tend to expect that children who are attractive are more intelligent, and are more likely to progress further in school. They also consider these students to be more popular. Voters choose political candidates who are more attractive over those who are less attractive. Men and women use physical attractiveness as a measure of how &quot;good&quot; another person is. In 1946, Soloman Asch coined the Implicit Personality Theory, meaning that the presence of one trait tends to imply the existence of other traits. This is also known as the halo effect. Research suggests that those who are physically attractive are thought to have more socially desirable personalities and lead better lives in general. This is also known as the &quot;what-is-beautiful-is-good effect&quot; or physical attractiveness stereotype. Discrimination against or prejudice towards others based on their appearance is sometimes referred to as lookism (prejudice or discrimination based on physical appearance and especially physical appearance believed to fall short of societal notions of beauty).

Some researchers conclude that little difference exists between men and women in terms of sexual behaviour. Other researchers disagree. Symmetrically faced men and women have a tendency to begin to have sexual intercourse at an earlier age, to have more sexual partners, to engage in a wider variety of sexual activities, and to have more one-night stands. They are also prone to infidelity and are more likely to have open relationships. Additionally, they have the most reproductive success. Therefore, their physical characteristics are most likely to be inherited by future generations.

Concern for improving physical attractiveness has led many persons to consider alternatives such as cosmetic surgery. It has led scientists working with related disciplines such as computer imaging and mathematics to conduct research to suggest ways to surgically alter the distances between facial features in order to make a face conform more closely to the &quot;agreed-upon standards of attractiveness&quot; of an ideal face by using algorithms to suggest an alternative which still resembles the current face. One research study found that cosmetic surgery as a way to &quot;boost earnings&quot; was &quot;not profitable in a monetary sense.&quot; Some research shows that physical attractiveness has a marginal effect on happiness.

== Misconceptions ==

=== The golden ratio ===
The golden ratio, also known as the golden proportion, was considered the perfect measurement of harmony, beauty and proportion in Ancient Greece. Researchers Mohammad Khursheed Alam, Nor Farid Mohd Noor, Rehana Basri, Tan Fo Yew and Tay Hui Wen conducted a study to test if the golden ratio was a contributor to perceptions of facial attractiveness in various ethnic groups. A total of 286 people aged 18 to 25 participated in the survey, including 100 Malay (50 male, 50 female), 100 Malaysian Chinese (50 male, 50 female), and 86 Malaysian Indian (36 male, 50 female). This study excluded subjects of mixed race, those with craniofacial deformities, and those who had previously received orthodontic treatment or had face surgery. The results showed that the golden ratio had no significant association with physical attractiveness.

=== Ideal body shape for women ===
Some argue that body type preference is a mark of culture and regional beauty standards, and that there is no definitive &quot;ideal body&quot; for women, because it constantly shifts. Some authors argue that body types have never been universal and that most evolutionary psychology studies on the &quot;ideal female body&quot; shape have been questioned or disproven due to external factors such as unreliable data and idealized western gender roles. On the internet, communities can create their own niche beauty standards that differ from the cultural norm. It has been argued that the &quot;perfect body&quot; is a matter of personal preference and exposure to regional media.

<text>Amatu&#x27;l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum (born Mary Sutherland Maxwell; 8 August 1910 – 19 January 2000) was an American-born Canadian Hand of the Cause of the Baháʼí Faith. She was the wife of the Ottoman-born Iranian religious figure Shoghi Effendi, who succeeded his grandfather ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá to become the Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith between 1921 and 1957. Appointed as a Hand of the Cause in 1952, her primary responsibility was to expand and protect the global Baháʼí community. In this capacity, she was among the leading Hands of the Cause who, following Effendi&#x27;s death in 1957, took on the role of ensuring the transfer of the religion&#x27;s supreme legal authority to the Universal House of Justice, which has governed out of Haifa, Israel, since 1963.

Khánum was born to Canadian architect William Sutherland Maxwell and American spiritualist Mary Ellis Bolles, both Christians who later became Baháʼís. As an adolescent, she embarked on two pilgrimages to Haifa&#x27;s Baháʼí World Centre, where she first met Effendi, whom she would marry in 1937. Owing to the fact that Effendi died without having any children, she was regarded by many Baháʼís as the last remaining link to his great-grandfather Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, who founded the Baháʼí Faith in Iran and the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century.

For much of the latter half of her life, Khánum actively ventured throughout many parts of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, where she worked to establish and develop local Baháʼí communities. During this time, she published a number of books and documentaries, and was also officially received by the United Nations and many countries&#x27; governments. In 2004, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation placed her at number 44 on the voters&#x27; list of &quot;greatest Canadians&quot; for the television series &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;.

At the age of 89, Khánum died in Haifa and was laid to rest at the Baháʼí World Centre in the city.

==Early life==

=== North America ===
Khánum was born Mary Sutherland Maxwell in New York City on 8 August 1910. Her father William Sutherland Maxwell was a Canadian of Scottish ancestry (Aberdeen and Jedburgh) from Quebec, and her mother Mary Ellis Bolles was an American of English ancestry from New Jersey. The family lived in Montreal, where her father worked as an architect. In 1912, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá visited Canada from Iran and stayed in the Maxwells&#x27; home, where he met the two-year-old Khánum, whom he described as the &quot;essence of sweetness.&quot;

Her mother sought to give her an education that was free of the rigidity of the traditional educational methods in the country, and thus established the first Montessori school at their residence. Khánum began reading and writing at a young age and her pastimes included writing poetry, novels, and plays. She was fluent in English, French, German, and Persian. In her youth, she twice visited the Baháʼí World Centre—initially with her mother and again with her mother&#x27;s friends—aged 15 and 16. It was on these Baháʼí pilgrimages that she first met Shoghi Effendi, who had recently succeeded his grandfather ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá as the spiritual head of the Baháʼí Faith.

In her youth, Khánum was engaged in many Baháʼí activities. At the age of 15, she joined the &quot;Executive Committee of the Fellowship of Canadian Youth for Peace&quot;. She was also involved in local racial equality conventions, including dances. A spectator, Sadie Oglesby, who became one of the first African American Baháʼís, described her as &quot;sixteen-year-old Mary Maxwell, a beautiful and most refreshing girl to know.&quot; By the age of 21, she was elected to the Montreal&#x27;s Bahá’í Spiritual Assembly.

Considered attractive and a gifted orator by her contemporaries, Khánum quickly established herself as a prominent member of the Baháʼí Faith in North America. She embarked on regular trips around the United States and Canada to propagate the religion. Beginning in 1932, she lectured on The Dawn-Breakers throughout the United States, and in May 1933, during a visit to Washington, D.C., she insisted that all meetings be open to both Blacks and Whites. Khánum also held talks at Howard University, making a concerted effort to connect with African Americans who were interested in the Bahá’í Faith. Additionally, while in her early 20s, she attended a number of official functions with her father in Montreal, meeting dignitaries like the Governor General of Canada at a variety of events, such as the Fifty-Fourth Exhibition of the Royal Canadian Academy.

=== Europe and World War II ===
As a young woman, Khánum had expressed a great desire to learn Spanish. However, her plans to travel to Spain were thwarted by the Spanish Civil War. Instead, in 1935, just two years after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, she chose to live with her cousin in Germany in a move that was endorsed by Effendi, who encouraged her to strengthen the fledgling German Baháʼí community. There, she assimilated into German society, wearing a dirndl and learning to speak the language fluently. Nevertheless, by 1937, the religion had been outlawed by the Nazi regime, which later began persecuting Baháʼís.

During this time, Khánum and her mother accepted an invitation from Effendi to go on another Baháʼí pilgrimage. The two initially planned to travel through the Balkans, but the outbreak of World War II forced them to travel directly to Haifa.

== Marriage ==

Mary had spent extended periods with Shoghi Effendi before their marriage, initially meeting him when she was 12 years old. After a pilgrimage three years later, she maintained constant communication with Shoghi Effendi. In January 1937, Mary and her mother arrived in Haifa, initiating a discreet courtship with Shoghi Effendi. By February, the couple was engaged, and Mary promptly cabled her father to join them in Haifa. On March 24, at the age of 26, Mary married Shoghi Effendi in a simple ceremony. It was during this time that Shoghi Effendi bestowed upon her the title &quot;Amatu&#x27;l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum&quot; (&quot;Amatu&#x27;l-Bahá&quot; means &quot;Handmaiden of Glory&quot;). The official announcement of their marriage was cabled to the Baháʼí world by Shoghi Effendi&#x27;s mother, Ḍíyáʼíyyih:Announce Assemblies celebration marriage beloved Guardian. Inestimable honour conferred upon handmaid of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh Ruhiyyih Khanum Miss Mary Maxwell. Union of East and West proclaimed by Baháʼí Faith cemented. Ziaiyyih mother of Guardian. As Rúhíyyih was getting used to life in the East, the newlyweds made a trip to Switzerland, and Shoghi Effendi introduced his young bride to his favourite sights in the country. It was initially difficult for her to adjust to her new home and she suffered periods of loneliness and homesickness. With the encouragement of Shoghi Effendi, she studied both the Bible and the Quran and started learning Persian. She later became fluent in the language and was able to deliver talks in Persian. In a letter to her mother a year after her marriage, she wrote that &quot;if anyone asked me what my theme was in life I should say, &#x27;Shoghi Effendi&#x27;&quot;.

== Later life ==
Almost immediately after their marriage, she served as the Guardian&#x27;s secretary, and then in 1941 until 1957 she served as Shoghi Effendi&#x27;s principal secretary in English. In 1951, she was appointed to the International Baháʼí Council, which was an administrative institution of the Baháʼí Faith created as a precursor to the Universal House of Justice to act as a liaison between the Council and Shoghi Effendi. Later on, on March 26, 1952, she was appointed to the office of Hand of the Cause of God – a distinguished rank in service to the religion – for which she attended to issues related to the propagation and protection of the religion.

After Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, she became for Baháʼís the last remaining link to the family of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, who headed the Faith from 1892 to 1921 and was the eldest son of the Faith&#x27;s Founder, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh.

=== Ministry of the Custodians ===
In 1957, her husband, Shoghi Effendi, died without having appointed a successor. Rúhíyyih Khánum was among the 27 Hands of the Cause who stewarded the religion for the six-year interim, before the Universal House of Justice was scheduled to be elected in 1963. The Hands voted among themselves for nine individuals to work at the Baháʼí World Centre to run the administration of the Faith, a position to which Rúhíyyih Khánum was elected; these nine were designated the Custodians. During this time, she worked on assuring the completion of the ten-year international teaching plan which was launched by Shoghi Effendi in 1953. Upon the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963, the ending point of Shoghi Effendi&#x27;s ten-year plan, the nine Hands acting as interim head of the Faith closed their office.

=== Work after Effendi ===
From 1957 until her death, Rúhíyyih Khánum traveled to over 185 countries and territories working with the world&#x27;s several million Baháʼís. She especially encouraged members of indigenous peoples to participate in the global Baháʼí community. Her travels took her to all the continents and to small islands. Some of her travels involved extended stays. For four years, she traveled for 58,000 kilometers in a Land Rover through sub-Saharan Africa, visiting 34 countries, in 19 of which she was received by the head of state. On another trip, she visited nearly 30 countries in Asia and the Pacific islands during a seven-month span. From January to March 1970, she crossed Africa from east to west, driving 2/3 of the distance herself, visiting many country&#x27;s communities, meeting with individuals and institutions, both Baháʼí and civic.

In 1975–6, she travelled by boat through the tributaries of the Amazon River of Brazil and visited the high mountain ranges of Peru and Bolivia. Thirty six tribal groups were visited over a period of six months; the trip was called &quot;The Green Light Expedition,&quot; which followed Khanum&#x27;s &quot;The Great African Safari.&quot; There have also been projects developed from the original expedition – &quot;In the Footsteps of the Green Light Expedition&quot; and &quot;Tear of the Clouds&quot;.
During her travels, she was received by the following heads of state and government:
* Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia,
* Malietoa Tanumafili II of Western Samoa
* Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India
* President Félix Houphouët-Boigny of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire
* President Carlos Menem of Argentina
* Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica, and
* Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Secretary-General of the United Nations.

<text>Armadillo (Antonio Rodriguez) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
Created by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Neary, the character made his first appearance in &quot;Captain America&quot; #308 (August 1985).

Gruenwald recounted that Armadillo &quot;is just a silly monster I wanted to throw in as kind of a joke on the old Marvel armadillo thing in the letters page&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Antonio Rodriguez was born in San Antonio, Texas. He was given superhuman strength and durability by Dr. Karl Malus. This process involved having his human genes combined with the genetic material of an armadillo which gave him the appearance of a humanoid armadillo. The Armadillo&#x27;s original motivation during his criminal career was to get enough money to be able to pay a doctor to discover a way to cure his girlfriend Maria of an unspecified terminal illness. When she was cured from her treatment, Maria abandoned him because of his appearance. Since that time, his motive has been to secure enough money to pay the Power Broker or some other scientist to reverse the process which transformed him. As part of the Armadillo&#x27;s first encounter with superheroes, he was dispatched by Dr. Karl Malus to break into the West Coast Avengers Compound and free Goliath. There, the Armadillo battled Captain America who released him after learning of the sacrifice he made for the comatose Maria.

The Armadillo later joined the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation. While on tour with the UCWF, he battled Captain America and Hawkeye atop the Empire State Building. He had apparently gone berserk after discovering his estranged wife Bonita with another man, and was intending to commit suicide. Captain America tried to talk him down, but the Armadillo jumped off the building. He survived the fall, but was arrested.

He was later seen incarcerated in the Vault. Having been talked out of a criminal career by Captain America and his allies, he surrendered to Vagabond to avoid further prosecution. Armadillo only wished to serve out the remainder of his sentence. To this end, he fought against various supervillains who wished to engineer large-scale breakouts, including Venom, and later various supervillains released by the Thunderbolts as they broke out Moonstone.

After being released from the Vault, Armadillo became the regional champion of the Ultimate Fighting League. After his defeat by Daniel Axum (formerly the villain Battler), Armadillo was reduced to begging in an alleyway. There, he talked Daniel Axum out of joining a Spider-Man Revenge Squad.

Having fallen on hard times, Armadillo proceeded to join the Constrictor and Jack O&#x27;Lantern in robbing an armored car. After his defeat by Hercules, Armadillo was incarcerated at The Raft, and chained to Tiger Shark. During the break-out initiated by Electro, Armadillo and Tiger Shark escaped and hid out in the town of Fairbury, Illinois. There, they were confronted by the New Warriors, resulting in a battle in which both fugitives were defeated. Afterwards, Armadillo joined Vil-Anon, a twelve-step group dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.

During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, the Hood hires Armadillo as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act, and he is later seen among his gang. Armadillo is then spotted at the funeral of Stilt-Man which was located at the Bar with No Name. After poisoning the guests, the Punisher blew up the bar. It was later mentioned that &quot;they all had to get their stomachs pumped and be treated for third-degree burns.&quot;

Around this time, he was seen entering the office of The Consultant, a criminal PR agent of sorts who improves the reputation and occasionally powers of super-villains. Upon Armadillo&#x27;s entering his office, the Consultant asked his secretary to cancel the rest of his appointments for the afternoon as he anticipated a lot of work improving Armadillo&#x27;s image.

The Armadillo later took place in the Fifty State Initiative, as a member of Texas&#x27;s superhero team, The Rangers. He assists in saving the President from an assassination attempt by HYDRA forces. Many other heroes are involved in this as well.

However, he was fired by the Rangers for unstated reasons. He was next seen doing lucha libre wrestling in Mexico for small cash, eventually being recruited by MODOK. After being one of the few villains that does not betray MODOK, Armadillo gains more money than initially promised. He happily departs with Puma and Nightshade (with whom he&#x27;d developed a friendship, and shows a desire for them to remain as a team).

Armadillo is mentioned as being incarcerated in The Raft next to Doctor Doom prior to the breakout in &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;. A group of former HYDRA agents kidnapped Armadillo to evaluate a neurotoxin Anathema on him. They made a presentation to Madame Hydra, to get back in Hydra. Armadillo is saved by the True Believers.

After the Siege of Asgard, he was seen as a bodyguard for the new Rose. Armadillo comes into conflict with Jackpot and Spider-Man when they try to infiltrate the Rose&#x27;s penthouse. Armadillo throws Jackpot through a window and prevents Spider-Man from saving her.

Armadillo later hides out in Puebla, but one of the locals reports him to a vigilante group, who attack him. The fight is quickly joined by the Hulk and She-Hulk. She-Hulk convinces Armadillo to stop fighting. She also suggests helping the people of Puebla before turning himself in promising to act as his lawyer in court.

He is next seen fighting the Scarlet Spider at a rodeo in Houston when he drunkenly tries to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend.

Following the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Armadillo is seen taking part in a prison riot. Mimic and Rogue were the only ones to respond. Copying the powers of Armadillo, Equinox, and Man-Bull, Mimic and Rogue were able to stop the riot. Boomerang and Owl then hire Armadillo onto the Sinister Sixteen, assembled to distract the Chameleon&#x27;s forces while Boomerang steals from him.

Working for She-Thing, Armadillo is next seen attacking the Thing while they are both imprisoned.

Armadillo later joins HYDRA after Baron Helmut Zemo promises to cure his condition in exchange for his allegiance. He takes part in HYDRA&#x27;s plot to sterilize the human race by using Inhuman blood, but betrays Zemo after Sam Wilson, the new Captain America, tells Armadillo that by serving HYDRA, he&#x27;d be trading his soul and humanity just to be cured.

Armadillo is later revealed to have been hired by Dr. Karl Malus in exchange for a cure to his condition. He aids the Sons of the Serpent in a trafficking plot to ship illegal immigrants for a genetic experiment conducted by Karl Malus and fights Sam Wilson, who had followed the leader of the smugglers to a diner. During the fight, Armadillo expresses his anger and frustration on Sam for not keeping his promise to cure him.

Armadillo is later seen on a crime spree when he is defeated by Ironheart.

During the &quot;Opening Salvo&quot; part of the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Armadillo is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.

During the &quot;Search for Tony Stark&quot; arc, Armadillo rejoined Hood&#x27;s gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom.

During the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Armadillo is among the animal-themed characters that were captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Great Hunt&quot; that is sponsored by Arcade&#x27;s company Arcade Industries. He was seen watching the fight between Spider-Man and Scorpion until the Hunter-Bots created by Arcade Industries arrived. Then he was seen fleeing from the Hunter-Bots when the &quot;Great Hunt&quot; begins. Armadillo was seen with the remaining animal-themed characters who were gathered by Vulture. Armadillo partook in the attack on the Hunter-Bots. Armadillo was freed when Kraven the Hunter had Arcade lower the forcefield around Central Park. Armadillo and the Serpent Society were seen charging towards the police only to be subdued by the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Spider-Woman fought Armadillo in the Bronx. Upon being defeated, Armadillo states to her that he has no idea what Hydra is up to while having referenced Baron Zemo&#x27;s cure offer to him. As members of the Menagerie, Armadillo and Man-Bull fought Spider-Man and She-Hulk until Mary Jane Watson arrived in her Jackpot outfit. She helped Spider-Man entangle Armadillo&#x27;s ball form.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to a genetic altering procedure performed on him by the villainous Dr. Karl Malus, Armadillo has superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. It was originally believed that his costume, a scaly nine-foot-tall orange armored hide with claws useful for digging through earth, was bonded to his skin by this process. It was later revealed that it was not a costume, but part of his body that had been mutagenically altered with the genetic material of an actual armadillo. His armor is bulletproof and his claws can tear through all but the densest of substances. Like an actual armadillo, he can roll up into a ball.

Armadillo is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as he was a skilled street fighter prior to his superhuman transformation.

==Love interests==
Armadillo had different love interests:

* Maria Bonita Rodriguez was Antonio Rodriguez&#x27;s wife. While Antonio was serving prison time, his wife fell to an unspecified illness. After his release, he tried to find a cure. He met Dr Karl Malus who turned Antonio into the Armadillo and promised to cure Bonita if Antonio obeyed his orders. After Armadillo&#x27;s encounter with Captain America, the Avengers forced Karl Malus to cure Antonio Rodriguez&#x27;s wife. When he discovered that during his wrestling career his wife cheated on him with a man named Ramon, Armadillo went berserk. At one point, he escaped the Vault to find and kill his unfaithful wife. Finally, he was talked out of it by Vagabond.
* Daisy Schilling became Antonio Rodriguez&#x27;s girlfriend. His dismissal from the Rangers impacted him and she left him because he was distant. Later, Daisy Schilling became a model in Texas and engaged to Wyatt Taft. When he learned of this, a drunk Armadillo charged in a Houston rodeo calling for her. Scarlet Spider intervened and the two fought. Armadillo&#x27;s ex-girlfriend jumped into the field and stopped them. She&#x27;d always had feelings for Antonio Rodriguez. The two lovers hugged and kissed under the applause of the crowd.

==Reception==
* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Armadillo 1st in their &quot;Spider-Man: 10 Weirdest Animal Villains From The Comics That We&#x27;d Like To See In The MCU&quot; list.

==In other media==
* Armadillo appears in &quot;M.O.D.O.K.&quot;, voiced by Dustin Ybarra. This version&#x27;s longs for his wife Irene even though they have been apart for eight years and he never formally proposed to her. In his most notable appearance in the episode &quot;If Saturday Be... For the Boys!&quot;, MODOK recruits Armadillo, among other D-List villains, to help him steal Captain America&#x27;s shield. During this time, Armadillo takes a detour to Irene&#x27;s house to try and win her back, but ends up in a fight with her new husband Mandrill until MODOK breaks it up and teaches Armadillo to move on with his life.
* Armadillo makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;.

The team is currently led by head coach Pablo Mastroeni.

In domestic soccer, Real Salt Lake won the 2009 MLS Cup, and they finished as runners-up in the Supporters Shield in 2010 and the 2013 editions of both the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup. The club additionally finished runners-up in the 2010-11 CONCACAF Champions League, becoming the first American club to do so during the tournament&#x27;s group stage format. Their fully owned USL affiliate, Real Monarchs, won the USL Championship, the second division in American soccer, in 2019.

== Name ==
The Spanish title &quot;Real&quot; (), meaning &quot;royal&quot; in English, has been used since the early 20th century by Spanish soccer clubs who have received royal patronage from a reigning monarch — most notably Madrid, Zaragoza, Betis and Sociedad. In choosing the name &quot;Real&quot; for the Salt Lake-based team, initial owner Dave Checketts intended to create a brand name that would become well-known for its simplicity, followed the European-style naming conventions of the league, and would potentially foster a partnership with Real Madrid — admired both because of their successful soccer history and close association with basketball (similar to Checketts&#x27; own history with Utah&#x27;s NBA team).

Local reaction to the new team&#x27;s name was initially met with mixed feelings, with the name being accused of contrivance. Other suggested team names, such as &quot;Highlanders&quot;, &quot;Latter Day Saint FC&quot;, &quot;Salt Lake SC&quot;, or &quot;Union SLC&quot;, were initially preferred for the club by locals. However, by at least 2014, reaction to the name had drastically improved, with the team establishing an identity representative of the Salt Lake community.

== History ==
=== Early years (2005–2006) ===

Real Salt Lake became the twelfth MLS franchise when Major League Soccer awarded an expansion franchise on July 14, 2004, to SCP Worldwide, headed by Dave Checketts. Jason Kreis became the first player in RSL history, coming in a trade from the Dallas Burn. Other notable players who played in RSL&#x27;s early years included veterans Clint Mathis, Eddie Pope and Jeff Cunningham.

RSL&#x27;s first season was 2005 under head coach John Ellinger. RSL began play on April 2, 2005, against New York MetroStars at Giants Stadium, which ended in a scoreless tie. The following week, Jason Kreis scored the first goal in franchise history in a 3–1 loss to LA Galaxy at the Home Depot Center. RSL played its first-ever home match on April 16, 2005, before 25,287 fans at Rice-Eccles Stadium; Brian Dunseth scored a header in the 81st minute to deliver a 1–0 victory over the Colorado Rapids. The season was mostly a disappointment, however, with the team setting a league record by posting a 557-minute scoreless streak (later broken by Toronto FC). They were also on a 10-game losing streak before managing a 2–2 draw on the road against San Jose Earthquakes. The first season finished with a record of 5–22–5.

In 2006, Real Salt Lake&#x27;s second season, the team recorded five losses and one tie in the first six matches of the season. RSL had gone 18 consecutive matches without a victory—the longest winless streak in MLS history. Jeff Cunningham, who came to Salt Lake from Colorado, provided most of Real&#x27;s highlights during an otherwise poor 2006 season. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a 10–13–9 record.

=== Turnaround and new stadium (2007–2008) ===
Real Salt Lake boasted a formidable attack with Cunningham and Kreis up front, joined by recently signed Panamanian international Luis Tejada. They were supported by veteran talent in the midfield and defense, such as Chris Klein, Carey Talley, and newly arrived goalkeeper Nick Rimando.
Their first game of the 2007 MLS season was a 2–2 draw for FC Dallas on Real&#x27;s home turf. RSL were outscored 6–0 in their next three games. In a stunning move, Ellinger was fired and replaced by Kreis, who immediately retired as a player. Also, general manager Steve Pastorino resigned and was later replaced by Garth Lagerwey. The franchise launched a massive re-construction project that continued throughout the year. The team finished with a disappointing 6–15–9 record, missing the playoffs yet again.

In the 2008 MLS season, working with new general manager Garth Lagerwey, RSL added several key players including Kyle Beckerman, Robbie Findley, Javier Morales, Nat Borchers and Jamison Olave. As Real established chemistry together, they emerged as a force when playing at home. The team&#x27;s home field advantage improved dramatically in with the opening in October 2008 of Rio Tinto Stadium (now known as America First Field), the new soccer-specific stadium in Sandy. Through the regular season, their home record ended at 8–1–6. Finishing 2008 with a 10–10–10 record, RSL advanced to the playoffs for the first time. RSL advanced past Chivas USA in the first round of the playoffs. The post-season ended, however, with a RSL loss to the Red Bulls in the Western Conference final.

=== MLS and CONCACAF success (2009–2012) ===
In the 2009 MLS season, RSL proved nearly invincible at home, having a 9–1–5 record in Rio Tinto Stadium (America First Field), with a record-setting +23 goal differential. Real Salt Lake did not lose a league game at home since May 2009. However, the team struggled to maintain form during road games. In the final weeks of the regular season, RSL found itself in a battle for the final two spots in the MLS playoffs. However, thanks to a victory over Colorado in the final game of the regular season, RSL clinched a position in the 2009 MLS playoffs. Despite finishing with a losing record overall (11–12–7), the team was granted the last spot through a tie-breaker.
Real Salt Lake went on to win the 2009 MLS Cup by defeating the Los Angeles Galaxy in the November 22 final. RSL played the L.A. Galaxy to a 1–1 tie through overtime and won the MLS Cup (5–4 on penalties). Robbie Russell won the game on a penalty kick. Goalkeeper Nick Rimando was named Man of the Match. The victory in the 2009 MLS Cup qualified RSL for the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League.

The 2010 season saw RSL continue its home unbeaten streak. On October 16, 2010, Real Salt Lake improved their home unbeaten streak to 25 games after beating the FC Dallas. This win gave Real Salt Lake the most consecutive home games without a loss in MLS history. RSL tied San Jose Earthquakes 2005 record for a single-season home unbeaten streak with zero losses in the 2010 regular season. Real Salt Lake finished second in the race for the Supporters Shield with a (15–4–11) record. Goalkeeper Nick Rimando led the league with 14 shutouts, and Jámison Olave was named MLS Defender of the Year. In the MLS playoffs, however, RSL lost to FC Dallas in the first round.

For the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League, Real Salt Lake were placed in Group A with Cruz Azul of Mexico, Toronto FC of Canada and Arabe Unido of Panama. Real Salt Lake finished first in Group A, with a perfect 3–0 home record and a 1–1–1 away record.
RSL continued its run in the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League knockout rounds in spring 2011. In the quarterfinals, Real Salt Lake advanced by beating the Columbus Crew 4–1 over two games. In the semi-finals, Real Salt Lake beat Saprissa 2–0 in the home leg, before losing the away leg 1–2. The 3–2 aggregate was enough for Real to advance and become the first MLS team to reach the CONCACAF Champions League finals.
Real Salt Lake played the first leg of the finals at Mexican side Monterrey. RSL&#x27;s Javier Morales scored in the 89th minute, ending the game in a 2–2 draw. The second leg of the final was held on April 27, 2011, at Rio Tinto Stadium (America First Field); Monterrey scored the only goal of the game, giving Monterrey a 3–2 aggregate victory.

In their 2011 MLS season, RSL&#x27;s home unbeaten streak ended at 29 games on May 28, 2011, with their loss to the Seattle Sounders FC. Real finished the regular season with a 15–11–8 record and finished third in the western conference. In the MLS playoffs, RSL defeated Seattle Sounders 3–2 on aggregate. In the conference finals, RSL lost 3–1 to the LA Galaxy and were eliminated. RSL qualified for the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League, since LA had won both the 2011 MLS Cup and Supporters&#x27; Shield, and RSL had the next best record.

In 2012, Real finished second in the Western conference during the regular season. In the playoffs, RSL lost to Seattle in the conference semi-finals, and were eliminated from the playoffs. In the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League, RSL were placed in Group 2 with Herediano of Costa Rica and Tauro of Panama, but were eliminated at the group stage.

=== Dell Loy Hansen ownership (2013–2021) ===
In 2013, Checketts sold his stake in Real Salt Lake to minority owner Dell Loy Hansen. Before the season, the club also traded key players Jámison Olave, Fabián Espíndola and Will Johnson. RSL finished the season in second place in the Western Conference with a 16–10–8 (W-L-T) record, and reached both the Open Cup and MLS Cup finals, losing both to D.C. United and Sporting Kansas City, respectively.

After the season, head coach Jason Kreis left Real Salt Lake to become the first head coach of expansion club New York City FC, with long-time assistant coach Jeff Cassar replacing him at the helm. Despite the departure, the club finished the 2014 season in third in the Western Conference, with a record of 15–8–11 totaling 56 points, and qualified for the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League. In the MLS Cup Playoffs, RSL was eliminated in the conference semi-finals by eventual champions LA Galaxy 5–0 on aggregate.

Despite a five-game unbeaten start to the 2015 season, the team eventually began to struggle in the standings, coupled with a loss to Sporting Kansas City in the semi-finals of the 2015 Open Cup. RSL also lost key player Nat Borchers, who they traded to the Portland Timbers before the season and all-time goalscorer Álvaro Saborío, traded away to D.C. United mid-season. Although late-season signings Luis Silva and Juan Manuel Martinez provided strong performances, the team did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2007.

The 2016 season started with the Quarterfinals on the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League where they were eliminated by eventual runner up Tigres UANL of Liga MX by an aggregate score of 3–1. The 2016 season saw Real Salt Lake return to the playoffs but they were once again eliminated by the LA Galaxy, this time by a 3–1 score line on the road in the Western Conference play in game. In the off season, longtime legends Javier Morales and Jamison Olave did not have their options exercised by the club.

On March 20, 2017, the club announced that head coach Jeff Cassar had been dismissed from his duties only three games into the season. Daryl Shore was named interim head coach for the two games against the New York Red Bulls and Minnesota United FC. On March 29 it was announced that Mike Petke would take over the head coaching position following the game against Minnesota United FC on April 1. Despite a dazzling late season run, the team finished one point shy of making the playoffs.

The 2018 season was heralded with the opening of the new $78 million Training Center and Zion&#x27;s Bank Real Academy in Herriman, Utah. The facility was praised for offering world-class training amenities year round for Real Salt Lake and the organization&#x27;s other teams the NWSL&#x27;s Utah Royals FC and the men&#x27;s second division side Real Monarchs. It also houses the team&#x27;s youth academy, which was moved from Casa Grande, Arizona, offering a single location and clear path for acquiring and developing young talent.

2019 saw the final seasons of both long-time goalkeeper Nick Rimando and defender Tony Beltran, both of whom retired following the end of the campaign. The club also saw the dismissal of head coach Mike Petke on August 11, following an incident between the coach and match officials during the 2019 Leagues Cup. Initially named interim manager for the remainder of the season, assistant coach Freddy Juarez was eventually named as head coach following the season.

The 2020 season, significantly shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, nonetheless saw major change affect the club. On August 30, MLS announced that Hansen would sell his stakes in Real Salt Lake, Utah Royals FC, and Real Monarchs following controversy over his past use of racist language. Additionally, long-time club captain – and final remaining member of the 2009 MLS Cup winning side – Kyle Beckerman retired following the season&#x27;s end, having played more regular season games than any outfield player in MLS history.

=== Ryan Smith and David Blitzer ownership (2022–present) ===
Unable to find a new owner, MLS took over the sales process on January 8, 2021, and RSL began the 2021 season with no defined ownership. Despite a relatively good start to the season, head coach Freddy Juarez unexpectedly left his role on August 27 to become an assistant coach with Seattle Sounders FC, leaving his own assistant coach Pablo Mastroeni to see out the season as interim. Under Mastroeni, the team made a late-season push to the playoffs, qualifying on the final day of the season through a stoppage-time goal by Damir Kreilach to give RSL a win over Sporting Kansas City. Despite barely making the playoffs, the team progressed to the conference finals for the first time since 2013, upsetting both Seattle and Kansas City (interestingly, through another stoppage-time goal) before being defeated by the Portland Timbers. This success led to Mastroeni being named permanent head coach following the season.

On January 5, 2022, the franchise was acquired by sports team investors Ryan Smith and David Blitzer.

== Stadium ==


In 2005 a soccer-specific stadium was approved for Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. However, a vote in 2006 struck down a funding proposal. Dave Checketts said that he would sell it if a proposal was not put forward. Parties from several cities, including Rochester, New York and St. Louis, Missouri, expressed interest in purchasing the franchise and moving it.

Finally, after months of discussions an agreement was put in place and Real Salt Lake announced that they would move forward with the construction of Real Salt Lake Stadium.
The Debt Review Committee of Salt Lake County, however, voted against the stadium. In response, Real Salt Lake&#x27;s owner announced the team would be sold and likely move out of the Salt Lake area after the 2007 season. However, a new stadium proposal was passed by the State Senate. The Utah House approved House bill 1SHB38, approving $35 million towards the development of Real Salt Lake&#x27;s new home. The governor signed the bill.

The $110 million stadium was built in Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. The stadium was named after its sponsor, Rio Tinto Group. The stadium opened on October 9, 2008. In September 2022, Rio Tinto Stadium was renamed America First Field, with RSL and America First Credit Union announcing a naming rights deal.

== Club culture ==
=== Rivalries ===
The main rival of Real Salt Lake is considered to be the Colorado Rapids, with the two teams being the closest to each other geographically, and also competing for the annual Rocky Mountain Cup. Competition first began upon Salt Lake&#x27;s entry into Major League Soccer in 2005, with the cup itself being awarded by a bi-partisan &quot;Committee of 10&quot;, made up of fans from each respective club. Initially dominated by the Rapids, Salt Lake has since taken a 12–5 series lead over their rivals, and are the current holders of the cup, having won it during the 2021 season.

Although no annual trophy is involved, the club&#x27;s more fierce rival has become Sporting Kansas City, initially born out of a 2011 preseason brawl and developed after the teams met in MLS Cup 2013. Since that time, the teams have regularly competed in the Western Conference. Many of the matches, have been heated among longtime players who played from the two teams. Real Salt Lake has a record of 19 wins, 12 draws and 17 losses in all competitions against Sporting.

The team also maintains smaller, fan-driven rivalries with the LA Galaxy, Los Angeles FC, and Seattle Sounders FC. The latter derived from a meeting in the 2012 MLS Cup Playoffs, later expanding through further playoff meetings and the losses of general manager Garth Lagerway, head coach Freddy Juarez, and club captain Albert Rusnák to the club.

=== Supporters groups ===

Real Salt Lake has six officially recognized supporters groups—Salt City United, Rogue Cavaliers Brigade, Section 26, Riot Brigade, Los Caballeros Reales (The Royal Knights), and La Barra Real — which as of 2019 all exist under a larger unified umbrella group known as The Riot.

Leo the Lion is the official mascot of Real Salt Lake.

=== Club anthem ===
In 2011, Branden Steineckert, drummer of punk band Rancid and a supporter of Real Salt Lake, composed the song &quot;Believe&quot; in honor of the club. Initially posted on YouTube, the song has since been adopted as the team&#x27;s official anthem, being sung at the beginning of every home game, at the end of every home game if the result is a win, as well as after all goals scored by RSL. The song used prior to the anthem was &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; by Gwen Stefani.

== Revenue and profitability ==
As Real Salt Lake is a small-market team, one of the team&#x27;s biggest challenges is bringing in enough revenue to remain competitive. Opening Rio Tinto Stadium in October 2008 provided a significant revenue boost to the team. Real Salt Lake went from 4,000 season-ticket holders before October 2008, to 8,750 in 2012, 10,000 in 2013, and 15,000+ in 2016.

=== Sponsorship ===
RSL has a long-term sponsorship deal with Intermountain Health. It previously had sponsorship deals with LifeVantage and Xango. Additional sponsors include JetBlue Airways, Maverik, Inc., Ford, WCF Insurance, and Zions Bank. Their corporate sponsors are America First Credit Union, Adidas, Atlas Disposal, City Creek Center, Coca-Cola, Collins Roofing Inc., Continental Tires, England Logistics, Utah Governor&#x27;s Office of Economic Development, Great Clips, Key Bank, Les Olson Company, MarketStar, Michelob ULTRA, Pikus Concrete, Planet Fitness, Presidio, RealMedia, Sew Sweet, Sherwin-Williams, Siegfried and Jensen, Summit Technology, Toro, Toyota, Utah Children&#x27;s Dental Network, Utah: Life Elevated, WGU, YESCO, and Zagg brands.

== Broadcasting ==
Radio broadcasts air on KSL AM 1160, FM 102.7 (English) and KTUB AM 1600 (Spanish).

From 2023, every Real Salt Lake match is available via MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app. Prior to the all-streaming deal, the club was aired across Utah on a number of television networks and stations.

Sinclair Broadcast Group held television rights to Real Salt Lake games that were not aired by Major League Soccer&#x27;s national television partners. The telecasts (which, until its discontinuation, were originally presented by Sinclair&#x27;s American Sports Network) featured pre- and post-game coverage. Sinclair&#x27;s Utah station KMYU served as the team&#x27;s flagship station, and telecasts were syndicated to other Sinclair-owned stations in the region, and non-Sinclair stations in Albuquerque, Phoenix and Tucson. In 2018, the team extended its television deal with Sinclair, and announced a streaming partnership with KSL-TV, under which it offered in-market streaming of RSL&#x27;s regional broadcasts, as well as their former sister club Utah Royals FC (NWSL) and reserve club Real Monarchs (then in the USL), on digital platforms. In 2020, the team extended its television deal with Sinclair until 2022.

<doc id="1053455" wikidata="Q948238" url="?curid=1053455" title="Mark Crossley">
<text>Mark Geoffrey Crossley (born 16 June 1969) is a football coach and former professional footballer.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper from 1988 until 2011 and he has previously played for numerous clubs in England&#x27;s top flight, notably for Nottingham Forest, where he became the only goalkeeper to save a Matt Le Tissier penalty kick. He has also played for Manchester United, Millwall, Middlesbrough, Stoke City, Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday, Oldham Athletic and Chesterfield. He earned three caps for the England U21 team, but opted to switch allegiance to Wales and received eight full international caps between 1997 and 2004.

Following retirement, he moved into coaching and has worked as a goalkeeping coach at Chesterfield, Sheffield Wednesday, Barnsley and Notts County. During these times he has spent two spells in caretaker charge of a club, having managed Chesterfield in 2012 and Notts County in 2018.

==Club career==

===Nottingham Forest===
Crossley was born in Barnsley and began his career with Nottingham Forest in 1987 as a trainee. He started the 1988–89 season as fourth choice but Hans Segers and Paul Crichton were transferred in quick succession to Wimbledon F.C. and Peterborough United respectively, and when Steve Sutton fell ill, Crossley found himself thrust into the first team, playing in league wins over Liverpool and Newcastle United and a League Cup win over Coventry City before Sutton&#x27;s return. He had a loan spell at Manchester United during the 1989–90 season but was never selected for the first team, although he played three times for the reserves. He had two spells in Forest&#x27;s team, firstly when Sutton was injured and later when Sutton suffered a loss of form.

He was a huge favourite with the fans and indeed with Brian Clough who affectionately nicknamed him &#x27;shithouse&#x27;, despite being prone to occasional mistakes, and made over 300 appearances in thirteen years with the club, becoming first-choice &#x27;keeper at the start of the 1990–91 season. This was strengthened by Steve Sutton&#x27;s move to Derby County in 1992. Crossley played in the 1991 FA Cup Final loss to Tottenham Hotspur, where he saved a penalty from Gary Lineker. He missed a run of games towards the end of the 1991–92 season, including the Full Members Cup and Football League Cup finals against Southampton and Manchester United respectively due to a breach of club rules. Andrew Marriott wore the gloves in his place, although Crossley regained his place for the next league game after the second final. He also has the dubious distinction of conceding the first Premier League own goal, in Forest&#x27;s 4–1 defeat at Blackburn Rovers on 5 September 1992.

He was granted a testimonial match during the 1999–2000 season by Nottingham Forest, which was played in front of 15,000 supporters. During that season, Crossley found himself on the bench numerous times, playing second choice &#x27;keeper to Dave Beasant. He was finally released from Forest, in 2000 as the club&#x27;s financial troubles required them to reduce the wage bill.

===Middlesbrough===
Crossley joined Middlesbrough on a free transfer to provide competition as well as cover for the number one spot at the club. He made seven appearances in the 2000–01 season, but was sent off against Arsenal in November 2000, and did not play again for the rest of the season. He played 18 more games in the 2001–02 season. He was loaned out to Stoke City on 29 November 2002 and played against Gillingham the next day. However, he was recalled by Boro until he re-joined Stoke towards the end of the 2002–03 season. He played in 11 matches helping the club avoid relegation from the First Division.

===Fulham===

Frustrated by not playing many games at Boro, Crossley joined Fulham for £500,000 in 2003 and made his debut against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium on 23 September 2003. He was mainly the second-choice goalkeeper during his time at the club, although he did have more opportunities to play in the first team during the 2005–06 season due to the sale of former number 1 goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. His finest match that season came when, deputising for the injured Finnish international Antti Niemi, he kept a clean sheet against champions Chelsea in a 1–0 victory, producing many saves as Chelsea piled pressure on late in the game. Before joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan, he was the number 3 &#x27;keeper to Niemi and Czech goalkeeper Jan Laštůvka at Fulham.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Former teammate and Sheffield Wednesday manager Brian Laws made Crossley his first signing in November 2006, bringing him in on loan. Crossley impressed, with a string of fine performances and the loan deal was extended to the end of the season. On 23 December 2006, Crossley scored a dramatic late equaliser for Sheffield Wednesday in a 3–3 draw with Southampton at Hillsborough, in his 481st career match, after coming up for a late corner. However Iain Turner was brought in on loan and Crossley returned to Fulham.

===Oldham Athletic===
After being released by Fulham at the end of the 2006–07 season, Crossley signed for League One side Oldham Athletic. He also took a coaching role at the club. He played most of the games available, despite being injured for 6 games in March.

Crossley signed a one-year extension to his current contract, he was contracted at Latics until the end of the 2008–09 season. After the final game of the season, the club reported that he and an assistant coach had parted with the club.

==Coaching career==
In the summer of 2009 he joined Chesterfield as part of John Sheridan&#x27;s new coaching team, as well as signing playing terms making him the club&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper. In February 2011 Crossley announced he would be retiring from football at the end of the 2010–11 season.

In July 2012 Crossley was approached by Birmingham City to become the club&#x27;s new goalkeeping coach for the 2012–13 season, however the move fell through when Chesterfield could not agree on a compensation fee. Following John Sheridan&#x27;s dismissal from Chesterfield, Crossley was appointed caretaker manager alongside Tommy Wright. In September 2012, despite having retired from playing in 2011, Crossley was named as an unused substitute in Chesterfield&#x27;s 2–2 draw at York City, taking the number 26 shirt. He left Chesterfield on 29 April 2013. On 13 August 2013, Crossley joined Sheffield Wednesday as the Owls&#x27; academy goalkeeper coach. Crossley joined Barnsley on 27 March 2014 as a replacement to Ian Wilcox as new goalkeeping coach.

Prior to the 2015–16 season, Crossley rejoined Chesterfield as a coach.

On 21 June 2019, Crossley left the Notts County first-team coaching set-up.

On 2 July 2019, Crossley rejoined Chesterfield as goalkeeper coach.

==International career==
Crossley qualified to play for Wales through his Welsh grandfather. He was a regular in the Welsh international squad, but served as understudy to Neville Southall, and then Paul Jones. He started only eight games. His full international début came against the Republic of Ireland. His most memorable moment with the national team was Wales&#x27; 4–0 win over Scotland. Prior to representing Wales, Crossley played for the England U21 team in a tournament in Toulon, France, in 1990.

<text>Ross Daniel Flitney (born 1 June 1984) is an English footballer who plays for Wimborne Town as a goalkeeper.

==Career==
Born in Hitchin, Flitney started as a youth player at Arsenal before moving to Fulham in 2003 where he was cover for senior keepers such as Edwin van der Sar and Mark Crossley, but never made a first-team appearance despite making the bench on several occasions in the 2004–05 season. He did however have two loan spells with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and a further loan spell with Doncaster Rovers. In March 2005 he joined Isthmian League side Yeading on loan. He was released by Fulham in May 2005, joining Barnet the following month.

On 26 October 2005, he became the recipient of the quickest red card in the history of Old Trafford. In a League Cup match for Barnet against Manchester United, he was sent off for handling the ball outside his penalty area, only 80 seconds into the game. It was his first touch in the match, and Barnet went on to lose 4–1. The red card was later rescinded on appeal. During the 2005–06 season, he lost his place to Lee Harrison who had rejoined Barnet as a player-coach in the summer. He was told he could leave Barnet in November 2006, but was finally released at the end of the season, joining Grays Athletic in June 2007.

Flitney signed for Croydon Athletic on loan in December 2008, and just one month later he was transfer listed by Grays, with financial pressures and manager Wayne Burnett&#x27;s plans being cited as the reason. A fortnight later, Flitney had his contract with the Essex side terminated by mutual consent, and signed a contract to stay with Croydon Athletic until the end of the season.

In January 2010, Flitney signed for Conference South club Dover Athletic. Dover manager Andy Hessenthaler said; &quot;He&#x27;s a keeper I&#x27;ve had my eye on. He brings something different to the table in that he is 6ft 3in and kicks the ball a mile!&quot;. Flitney made his debut for Dover in the 2–0 defeat to Woking on 23 January.

He was signed by Hessenthaler again, when he joined Gillingham in July 2011, and made his debut for Gillingham in the 1–0 win over Cheltenham Town on 6 August 2011.

In October 2012 he joined Eastleigh on an initial loan period of one month. After his loan at Eastleigh finished in January 2013, and his subsequent release by Gillingham, he rejoined Eastleigh on a permanent basis in February 2013. Flitney played the first nine games of the 2016–17 season for Eastleigh but then signed for Brighton-based National League South side Whitehawk, rejoining his former manager Richard Hill and making his debut in a 3–0 away win at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford on 8 October. Flitney was sent off after the final whistle in the FA Cup first round against Stourbridge on 14 November for protesting to referee Robert Whitton, who had just blown for full-time with the ball in play, seconds before Javier Favarel scored a 30-yard volley which would have been the winning goal. On 14 January against Dulwich Hamlet in the FA Trophy second round, with his side leading 1–0, Flitney came off the bench to replace Hawks&#x27; injured keeper Tom Stewart in the 65th minute and went on to concede four times as well as give away and then save a penalty in the time remaining.
Flitney left the Hawks at the end of January 2017, his last game being a 1–3 defeat at Hungerford Town on 23 January, a game in which he conceded a penalty after just four minutes.
On 16 February 2017, Flitney joined Bromley on a short-term deal for the remainder of the campaign. Following 14 league appearances, in which he helped the club to a 10th-place finish, Flitney departed Bromley at the end of the season to eventually rejoin Eastleigh.
On 20 June 2023, Flitney joined Wimborne Town.

<doc id="1053466" wikidata="Q409459" url="?curid=1053466" title="Airén">
<text>Airén is a variety of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, a white grape commonly used in winemaking. This grape is native to Spain where it represents almost a quarter of all grapes grown. As of 2017, Airén was estimated to be the world&#x27;s fourth most grown wine grape variety in terms of planted surface, at , an increase from in 2004, where it held 1st place, although it is almost exclusively found in Spain.
Since Airén tends to be planted at a low density, several other varieties (including Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) are more planted in terms of number of vines.

==Description==
The grapes have a cotton-like bud burst, which is bronze or yellowish in colour, with light reddish edge, and not very intense at the tip. The grapes have a trailing growing habit. The leaves of the Airén are average in size and have a pentagonal shape. The lower lateral sinuses are less marked than the upper ones and the upper face of the leaf is yellowish green in color while the lower face is velvety. The grape bunch is large in size and has an average compactness. It can grow in two different shapes: cylindrical or as a long cone. The grapes are large and spherical and have a yellowish color. The grapes are late to bud burst and also late to ripen. They yield about 4.5 to 6 kg per vine. Further, this grape is very resistant to drought and the base buds are fertile and thus resists very short pruning and still have acceptable yields.

==History==

The first recorded mention of Airén was in 1615. In the 15th century it was known as Lairén (as it is in the Córdoba region today) and is cited as such in Gabriel Alonso de Herrera’s “Agricultura General”. This author however preferred to call it “Datileña” because the grapes were bunched together like dates. He confesses to not having tasted the wine but states that “it is not very strong nor does it have much body” and also that “it would be better to make raisins from these grapes as they are very shapely and abundant”.

In 1807, Roxas Clemente describes two types of Layrén: the first is the one we know today as the modern Airén from La Mancha and second is a table grape as described by Herrera as the Datileña. The first reference by Roxas Clemente mentions that Airén is also known as Mantúo Laerén and Laerén de Rey. He describes this variety as follows:

He says that this variety is grown in Sanlúcar, Xerez, Trebujena, Arcos, Espera, Moguer, Tarifa and Paxarete. He also mentions that it is grown in Valdepeñas and Manzanares, where it gives excellent wines for the production of exquisite spirits. The second reference by Roxas Clemente to Layrén states that this variety is synonymous to the Datileña. He describes it as:
 This grape, according to Roxas Clemente, is used for the production of raisins and to mix its must with that of the Ximénez variety, and in 1807 was grown in Sanlúcar, Xerez, Trebujena, Algeciras, Arcos, Espera, Moguer, Málaga, Motril, Albuñol, Adra y Paxarete.

In 1885, Abela stated that Mantúo Laerén, apart from the areas mentioned by Roxas Clemente, was also grown in the region of Córdoba (known there as Mantúo Lairén) and in the areas around Cáceres, Ciudad Real, Málaga, Sevilla and Toledo, where it was known as Lairén.

In 1914, García de los Salmones mentioned the cultivation of Lairén in Madrid, Villacañas (Toledo), Tarancón (Cuenca), Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Frejenal de la Sierra (Badajoz), Montefrío (Granada), Baeza (Jaén), Coin (Málaga), Fiñana (Almería), Cazalla de la Sierra (Sevilla), Espera (Cádiz) and Córdoba. And as Airén in Albacete.

In 1954, Marcilla defined the Airén variety as a typical vine in the La Mancha region, grown almost exclusively in that area. He described it as a 
 Of the wine made from these grapes he states:

He also mentions Lairén as being grown in Montilla (Córdoba) and in Extremadura.

In 1965, Fernández de Bobadilla described Mantúo Laerén as:
 He says the following about its agronomic properties: 

In 1976, Hidalgo described Airén as follows:
In the &quot;Inventario Vitícola Nacional&quot; by Hidalago and Rodríguez Candela (1971) Airén is cited as growing in Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Madrid, Málaga y Toledo. As Lairén is cited as growing in Córdoba, Jaén y Sevilla. As Valdepeñera or Airén grown in Albacete.

In Jancis Robinson’s &quot;Guía de Uvas para Vinificación&quot; (1996) Airén is cited as the most grown variety of grape in the world: with 423.100 ha under cultivation, it exceeds Garnacha (Grenache) with 317.500 ha, Mazuelo with 244.330 ha, Ugni blanc with 203.400 ha, Merlot with 162.200 ha and Cabernet Sauvignon with 146.200 ha. She comments that it is the most common variety in Spain, comprising 30% of all vines. It is absolutely dominant in the Valdepeñas area and in La Mancha. She also comments that in the south of Spain it is known as Lairén.

In his book &quot;Cepas del Mundo&quot; (1997), José Peñín gives the origin of Airén as being in La Mancha, from where two thirds of all the grapes grown in Spain come from. It is absolutely the dominant variety in this region, especially so in Ciudad Real and Toledo, and slightly less so in Albacete and Cuenca. It can also be found further south in Montilla-Moriles. Peñín describes the wine made from Airén as follows:

Peñín goes on to comment on the agronomic characteristics: 

From this bibliography, it can be observed that two types of Airén (Lairén or Layrén) are described: one is the variety extensively grown in La Mancha and which is cited in the first reference by Clemente, by Abela, by García de los Salmones, by Marcilla, by Hidalgo, by Jancis Robinson, and by Peñín. The second type of Airén (Layrén or Datileña) is a table grape used to produce raisins and which is described by Alonso de Herrera, in the second reference by Clemente, and by Fernández de Bobadilla. The first mention of the name Airén (currently the most widely used denomination to define this variety) is in the citation by García de los Salmones (1914) in the province of Albacete.

==Regions==
Airén is by far the most abundant in the Valdepeñas and La Mancha DOs, very abundant in the provinces of Ciudad Real, Toledo, and only slightly less so in Albacete and Cuenca. The low vine density of Airén in La Mancha has led to it being the known as the largest area, planted to a single grape variety, in the world It can also be found significantly in Madrid and as far south as Montilla-Moriles.

==Viticulture and uses==
Airén is allowed in the following DOs: Alicante, Bullas, Jumilla, La Mancha, Valdepeñas and Vinos de Madrid. As &quot;Layrén&quot; it is allowed in Montilla-Moriles.

The Airén vine is commonly planted in unusually low vine density, around 1500 vines per hectare, which has a deleterious effect on wine quality as with any grape variety. Its vineyards cover vast areas but as trends in Spanish wine production move towards red wine, a huge number of Airéns vines are being uprooted, not least because the grape often produces an acidic and characterless wine, such as the wines produced from La Mancha&#x27;s Airén vines. Due to the anonymous nature of Airén wines, its principal use has generally been in the manufacture of Spanish brandy.

==Synonyms==
Airén is also known under the synonyms Aiden, Blancon, Forcallada, Forcallat, Forcallat blanca, Forcallat blanco, Forcayat, Forcellat bianca, Forcellat blanca, Laeren del Rey, Lairen, Layren, Manchega, Mantuo Laeren, Valdepenas, Valdepenera blanca, and Valdepenero.

<doc id="1053469" wikidata="Q313753" url="?curid=1053469" title="Papa Bouba Diop">
<text>Papa Bouba Diop (28 January 197829 November 2020) was a Senegalese professional footballer. His preferred position was as a defensive midfielder, but he could also play as a centre-back, where he played at Lens. Diop was considered a physically strong and aggressive player. His playing style, position, and ability drew comparisons to former France holding midfielder Patrick Vieira.

Diop spent much of his career in England, where fans nicknamed him &quot;The Wardrobe&quot; for his stature. He played Premier League football for Fulham and Portsmouth, and won the FA Cup with the latter club in 2008. He also played top-flight football in Switzerland for Neuchâtel Xamax and Grasshoppers, in France for Lens and in Greece for AEK Athens.

Diop&#x27;s second of a total of 11 international goals for Senegal came in a 1–0 victory over then-world champions France in the opening match of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, in Senegal&#x27;s first match at the FIFA World Cup. He also played at four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, finishing as runners-up in 2002.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Diop was born in Rufisque, Dakar. He began his football career with junior team Ndeffann Saltigue before joining ASC Diaraf of the Senegal Premier League in 1996. He left Senegal for Switzerland, where he spent a few months with third-tier club Vevey before signing as a professional for Ligue Nationale A club Neuchâtel Xamax in the 2000 close season. In December that same year, he joined fellow top-flight club Grasshoppers, whom he helped win the championship title in his first half-season and made his first appearance in UEFA competitions the next. He moved to France in January 2002 to join Lens of Division 1 on a five-and-a-half-year contract.

===Fulham===
After his impressive performances for Lens, Diop signed with Premier League team Fulham for £6 million, signing a four-year deal in July 2004. Diop made his debut against Manchester City on 14 August 2004, playing the full 90 minutes. Diop scored his first goal for Fulham against Chelsea, scoring Fulham&#x27;s only goal in a 4–1 home defeat. In his first season at Fulham, Diop made such an impressive display for the club that he was named Fulham&#x27;s Opta player of the season award for 2004–05.

Former Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez said that Diop had all the attributes to become one of the best midfielders in the Premiership. He said, &quot;There&#x27;s no reason why Bouba can&#x27;t get himself up to being one of the best centre midfield players in the Premiership and that&#x27;s where I see his long-term position. I&#x27;ve seen Diop play over the years and he has all the attributes to be a top-class midfielder&quot;.

For his performances during the 2005–06 season, Diop was nominated for the Fulham &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award. Diop would then sign a new deal keeping him until 2009. Diop then said that he made a right decision to sign a contract with Fulham. Diop became a fans&#x27; favourite.

An injury due to hamstring, foot, and back problems resulted in him missing part of the 2006–07 season and losing the captaincy to Danny Murphy. In January 2007 Wigan Athletic made a £5 million bid for the midfielder, but Diop decided against the move and stayed with Fulham, helping them to avoid relegation.

After Diop&#x27;s three years at Craven Cottage Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez allowed him to move on, and he transferred to Portsmouth on transfer deadline day. Diop finished his Fulham career having played 84 matches for the side, scoring nine goals.

===Portsmouth===
Diop signed a five-year deal with Portsmouth for a fee of £3.5 million. He made his debut against Liverpool on 15 September 2007 in a 0–0 draw. Diop was a key player in Portsmouth&#x27;s victorious 2008 FA Cup campaign, playing a solid, defensive game and making some crucial tackles against Cardiff City.

Following Portsmouth&#x27;s relegation, Diop was considered likely to be released. Portsmouth&#x27;s administrator, Andrew Andronikou, stated that Diop would only be leaving for a fee of £1 million, but Portsmouth eventually agreed to an undisclosed fee (reported as around £750,000) to transfer Diop to AEK Athens in July 2010. He played 72 games for Portsmouth without scoring.

===AEK Athens===
On 13 July 2010, Diop agreed terms with AEK Athens signing a two-year deal earning €900,000 per season, despite interest from Fulham, Celtic and Paris Saint-Germain.

Diop made his debut for AEK Athens against Dundee United on 19 August 2010 in a Europa League play-off first-leg game. Diop appeared as a substitute at the 81st minute of the 1–0 victory. Diop scored his first Super League goal against PAOK on 3 June 2011, the match finished 4–0 to AEK. Diop finished the season having played in only 19 league games. On 30 April 2011, Diop won the Greek Cup with AEK in a 3–0 win against Atromitos. Diop also scored two goals against PAOK in the Superleague Greece play-offs giving AEK the 3–0 lead.

===West Ham United===
On 30 August 2011, West Ham announced the signing of Diop on a one-year deal. He joined on a free transfer after leaving AEK Athens. The deal included an option to sign for a further year. He made his debut for West Ham on 1 October 2011 in a 2–2 away draw with Crystal Palace. He scored his first and only goal for West Ham, against Barnsley on 17 December 2011. His goal proved to be the winner in a 1–0 win. He made 16 appearances for West Ham in the league and was a popular member of the squad. Although not a team member on the day, Diop celebrated on the pitch with the team as they won promotion to the Premier League via the 2012 Football League Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 19 May 2012. On 30 June 2012, Diop was released by West Ham on expiry of his contract.

===Birmingham City===
In October 2012, he agreed terms to join former teammate Lee Clark&#x27;s Birmingham City on a short-term contract, subject to successful application for a working visa, and the deal was completed on 19 October. He then signed for a further month, and finally made his Birmingham debut as a second-half substitute in a 1–1 draw away to Blackpool on 27 November. He was booked within minutes of entering the game. With Hayden Mullins suspended and Jonathan Spector injured for the visit of Crystal Palace on 15 December, Diop made his first start for Birmingham, alongside League debutant Callum Reilly in central midfield. He scored the equalising goal, a powerful header from Rob Hall&#x27;s corner, as Birmingham came back from 2–0 down to draw, and was rewarded with another month&#x27;s contract. He injured a hamstring soon afterwards, and despite his imminent return to fitness, the club&#x27;s financial difficulties meant they could not offer him a further contract extension. He left the club in January 2013.

==International career==
Bouba Diop received his first call-up to the Senegal national squad in 1999, at the age of 21, while playing for Neuchâtel Xamax in the Swiss Super League. He was part of their squad that finished runners-up at the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations in Mali, and scored the opening goal of a 2–1 win over Nigeria in the semi-finals.

He is perhaps best known for scoring the first goal of 2002 FIFA World Cup against France, which resulted in the 1–0 defeat of the defending world champions and, ultimately, their early elimination from the tournament, in which Senegal reached the quarter-finals. He ended as his team&#x27;s best scorer of the tournament with three goals, having also scored twice against Uruguay. Diop celebrated his goal against France by running to the corner of the pitch, laying his shirt on the floor, and having his teammates dance around it.

Diop played at three more Africa Cup of Nations tournaments: in 2004 he scored in a 3–0 group win over Kenya in Tunisia, and in 2006 he netted in a 3–2 victory against Guinea in the quarter-finals. His last appearances were in a group-stage elimination in Ghana in 2008, in which Senegal manager Henryk Kasperczak resigned during the tournament due to the team&#x27;s ill discipline. Diop played 63 times for Senegal, scoring 11 goals.

During the 2022 World Cup, Senegal dedicated their win over Ecuador to Diop on the second anniversary of his death.

==Style of play==
His manager at Fulham, Chris Coleman, described him as a player with &quot;great feet, scores goals, defends well, tackles, has got good pace&quot;, and that his &quot;stature and ability&quot; were unique in the Premier League at the time, similar to that of Patrick Vieira. Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes described him as one of the most &quot;awkward&quot; players he had played against, and noted that &quot;you get involved physically with him and you&#x27;re wasting your time&quot;. During his playing career in England, Diop was nicknamed &quot;The Wardrobe&quot; for his stature (he was in height).

==Death==
Diop died in Paris on 29 November 2020 following a long illness. It was reported by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; that he had ALS.

Diop&#x27;s funeral was held in Dakar on 4 December before burial in his hometown. In attendance were his widow Marie-Aude, their son and daughter, President Macky Sall and teammates from the 2002 World Cup.

<text>A public toilet, restroom, bathroom or washroom is a room or small building with toilets (or urinals) and sinks for use by the general public. The facilities are available to customers, travelers, employees of a business, school pupils or prisoners. Public toilets are typically found in many different places: inner-city locations, offices, factories, schools, universities and other places of work and study. Similarly, museums, cinemas, bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues usually provide public toilets. Railway stations, filling stations, and long distance public transport vehicles such as trains, ferries, and planes usually provide toilets for general use. Portable toilets are often available at large outdoor events.

Public toilets are commonly separated by sex (or gender) into male and female toilets, although some are unisex (gender-neutral), especially for small or single-occupancy public toilets, public toilets are sometimes accessible to people with disabilities. Depending on the culture, there may be varying degrees of separation between males and females and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet, is lockable. Urinals, if present in a male toilet, are typically mounted on a wall with or without a divider between them.

Local authorities or commercial businesses may provide public toilet facilities. Some are unattended while others are staffed by an attendant. In many cultures, it is customary to tip the attendant, especially if they provide a specific service, such as might be the case at upscale nightclubs or restaurants. Public toilets may be municipally owned or managed and entered directly from the street. Alternatively, they may be within a building that, while privately owned, allows public access, such as a department store, or it may be limited to the business&#x27;s customers, such as a restaurant. Some public toilets are free of charge, while others charge a fee. In the latter case they are also called pay toilets and sometimes have a charging turnstile. In the most basic form, a public toilet may just be a street urinal known as a &quot;pissoir&quot;, after the French term.

Public toilets are known by many other names depending on the country; examples are: restroom, bathroom, men&#x27;s room, women&#x27;s room, powder room (US); washroom (Canada); and toilets, lavatories, water closet (W.C.), ladies and gents (Europe).

==Alternative names==

Public toilets are known by many names in different varieties of English.

In American English, &quot;restroom&quot; commonly denotes a facility featuring toilets and sinks designed for use by the public, but &quot;restroom&quot; and &quot;bathroom&quot; are often used interchangeably for any room with a toilet (both in public and in private homes). &quot;Restroom&quot; is considered by some to be slightly more formal or polite. &quot;Bathroom&quot; is quite common in schools. &quot;Comfort station&quot; sometimes refers to a visitor welcome center such as those in national parks. The term restroom derived from the fact that in the early 1900s through to the middle of the century up-scale restaurants, theatres and performing facilities would often have comfortable chairs or sofas located within or in a room directly adjacent to the actual toilet and sink facilities, something which can be seen in some movies of the time period. An example of this is the description of a &quot;movie palace&quot; which was opening in 1921 which was described as including &quot; ... a rest-room for the fair sex and a lounging room for the sterner sex ... off these rooms are the toilets.&quot;

In Canadian English, public facilities are frequently called and signed as &quot;washrooms&quot;, although usage varies regionally. The word &quot;toilet&quot; generally denotes the fixture itself rather than the room. The word &quot;washroom&quot; is rarely used to mean &quot;utility room&quot; or &quot;mud room&quot; as it is in some parts of the United States. &quot;Bathroom&quot; is generally used to refer to the room in a person&#x27;s home that includes a bathtub or shower while a room with only a toilet and sink in a person&#x27;s residence is typically called a &quot;washroom&quot; because one would wash one&#x27;s hands in it upon returning home or before a meal or a &quot;powder room&quot; because women would fix their make-up on their faces in that room. These terms are the terms typically used on floor plans for residences or other buildings. Real estate advertisements for residences often refer to &quot;three-piece washrooms&quot; (include a bathtub or shower) and &quot;two-piece washrooms&quot; (only toilet and sink). In public athletic or aquatic facilities, showers are available in locker rooms.

In Britain, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and New Zealand, the terms in use are &quot;public toilet&quot;, &quot;public lavatory&quot; (abbreviated &quot;lav&quot;), &quot;public convenience&quot;, and more informally, &quot;public loo&quot;. As public toilets were traditionally signed as &quot;gentlemen&quot; or &quot;ladies&quot;, the colloquial terms &quot;the gents&#x27; room&quot; and &quot;the ladies&#x27; room&quot;, or simply &quot;the gents&quot; and &quot;the ladies&quot; are used to indicate the facilities themselves. The British Toilet Association, sponsor of the Loo of the Year Awards, refers to public toilets collectively as &quot;away-from-home&quot; toilets.

In Philippine English, &quot;comfort room&quot;, or &quot;C.R.&quot;, is the most common term in use.

Some European languages use words cognate with &quot;toilet&quot; (e.g. &quot;les toilettes&quot; in French; &quot;туалет&quot; (tualet) in Russian), or the initialism &quot;W.C.&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;water closet&quot;, an older term for the flush toilet. In Slavic languages, such as Russian and Belarusian, the term &quot;sanuzel&quot; (санузел; short for &quot;sanitarny uzel&quot; — sanitary unit/hub) is sometimes used for public facilities which include a toilet, sink, and possibly a shower, bathtub, and / or bidet. Public urinals (&quot;pissoir&quot;) are known in several Romance languages by the name of a Roman Emperor: &quot;vespasienne&quot; in French and &quot;vespasiani&quot; in Italian.
Mosques, &quot;madrassas&quot; (schools), and other places Muslims gather, have public sex-separated &quot;ablution rooms&quot; since Islam requires specific procedures for cleansing parts of the body before prayer. These rooms normally adjoin the toilets, which are also subject to Muslim hygienical jurisprudence and Islamic toilet etiquette.

==Types==

Many public toilets are permanent small buildings visible to passers-by on the street. Others are underground, including older facilities in Britain and Canada. Contemporary street toilets include automatic, self-cleaning toilets in self-contained pods; an example is the Sanisette, which first became popular in France. As part of its campaign against open defecation, the Indian government introduced the remotely-monitored eToilet to some public spaces in 2014.

Public toilets may use seated toiletsas in most Western countriesor squat toilets. Squat toilets are common in many Asian and African countries, and, to a lesser extent, in Southern European countries. In many of those countries, anal cleansing with water is also the cultural norm and easier to perform while squatting than seated.

Another traditional type that has been modernized is the screened French street urinal known as a &quot;pissoir&quot; (&quot;vespasienne&quot;).

The telescopic toilet is designed to extend and retract vertically from a cylinder relative to street level depending on the time of day. It is typically installed in entertainment districts and operational only during weekends, evenings, and nights. The first such toilet was a telescopic urinal invented in the Netherlands, which now also offers pop-up toilets for women.

Private firms may maintain permanent public toilets. The companies are then permitted to use the external surfaces of the enclosures for advertising. The installations are part of a street furniture contract between the out-of-home advertising company and the city government and allow these public conveniences to be installed and maintained without requiring funds from the municipal budget.

Various portable toilet technologies are used as public toilets. Portables can be moved into place where and when needed and are popular at outdoor festivals and events. A portable toilet can either be connected to the local sewage system or store the waste in a holding tank until it is emptied by a vacuum truck. Portable composting toilets require removal of the container to a composting facility.

The standard wheelchair-accessible public toilet features wider doors, ample space for turning, lowered sinks, and grab-bars for safety. Features above and beyond this standard are advocated by the Changing Places campaign. Features include a hoist for an adult, a full-sized changing bench, and space for up to two caregivers.

Public toilets have frequently been inaccessible to people with certain disabilities.

==Purposes==

As an &quot;away-from-home&quot; toilet room, a public toilet can provide far more than access to the toilet for urination and defecation. People also wash their hands, use the mirrors for grooming, get drinking water (e.g. refilling water bottles), attend to menstrual hygiene needs, and use the waste bins. Public toilets may also become places for harassment of others or illegal activities, particularly if principles of Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) are not applied in the design of the facility.

==History==


=== Europe ===
Public toilets were part of the sanitation system of ancient Rome. These latrines housed long benches with holes accommodating multiple simultaneous users, with no division between individuals or groups. Using the facilities was considered a social activity.

By the Middle Ages public toilets became uncommon, with only few attested in Frankfurt in 1348, in London in 1383, and in Basel in 1455. A public toilet was built in Ottoman Sarajevo in 1530 just outside a mosque&#x27;s exterior courtyard wall which is still operating today.

Sociologist Dara Blumenthal notes changing bodily habits, attitudes, and practices regarding hygiene starting in the 16th century, which eventually led to a resurgence of public toilets. While it had been perfectly acceptable to relieve oneself anywhere, civility increasingly required the removal of waste product from contact with others.

New instruction manuals, schoolbooks, and court regulations dictated what was appropriate. For instance, in &quot;Galateo: or, A Treatise on Politeness and Delicacy of Manners&quot;, Giovanni della Casa states “It does not befit a modest, honourable man to prepare to relieve nature in the presence of other people, nor do up his clothes afterward in their presence. Similarly, he will not wash his hands on returning to decent society from private places, as the reason for his washing will arouse disagreeable thoughts in people.” Historian Lawrence Stone contends that the development of these new behaviours had nothing to do with problems of hygiene and bacterial infection, but rather with conforming to increasingly artificial standards of gentlemanly behaviour.

These standards were internalized at an early age. Over time, much that had to be explained earlier was no longer mentioned, due to successful social conditioning. This resulted in substantial reduction of explicit text on these topics in subsequent editions of etiquette literature; for example, the same passage in &quot;Les règles de la bienséance et de la civilité Chrétienne&quot; by Jean-Baptiste de la Salle is reduced from 208 words in the 1729 edition, to 74 words in the 1774 edition.

The first modern flush toilet had been invented in 1596, but it did not gain popularity until the Victorian era. When hygiene became a heightened concern, rapid advancements in toilet technology ensued. In the 19th century, large cities in Europe started installing modern flushing public toilets.

George Jennings, the sanitary engineer, introduced public toilets, which he called &quot;monkey closets&quot;, to the Crystal Palace for The Great Exhibition of 1851. Public toilets were also known as &quot;retiring rooms.&quot; They included separate amenities for men and women, and were the first flush toilet facilities to introduce sex-separation to the activity. The next year, London&#x27;s first public toilet facility was opened.

Underground public toilets were introduced in the United Kingdom in the Victorian era, in built-up urban areas where no space was available to provide them above ground. The facilities were accessible by stairs, and lit by glass brick on the pavement. Local health boards often built underground public toilets to a high standard, although provisions were higher for men than women. Most have been closed as they did not have disabled access, and were more prone to vandalism and sexual encounters, especially in the absence of an attendant. A few remain in London, but others have been converted into alternative uses such as cafes, bars and even dwellings.

=== Hong Kong ===
In the early days of the colony of Hong Kong, people would go to the toilet in sewers, barrels or in alleys. Once Hong Kong opened up for trade (1856–1880), the British Hong Kong government determined that the appalling hygiene situation in Hong Kong was becoming critical. Thus, the government set up public toilets (squat toilets) for people in 1867. But these toilets needed to be cleaned and emptied manually every day and were not popular. In 1894, plague broke out in Hong Kong and 2,500 people died, especially public toilet cleaners. The government decided to act, setting up underground toilet facilities to improve this situation, though these toilets also had to be cleaned and emptied manually.

Early in 1940, the colonial government built the first public flush toilet. In 1953, a fire broke out in Shek Kip Mei. After that, the government embarked on a major public housing project in Hong Kong including public toilets for residents. More than ten people shared each toilet and they used them for bathing, doing their laundry as well as going to the toilet. Finally, in the 1970s, the government decided that one toilet for four or five families was insufficient and renovated all public housing providing separate flush pedestal toilets for all residents.

=== United States ===
In the United States, concerns over public health and sanitation spurred the sanitarian movement during the late 1800s. Reforms to standardize plumbing codes and household plumbing were advocated for; the intersection of advancements in technology and desire for cleanliness and disease-free spaces spurred the development of public toilets.

Facilities for women sometimes had a wider emphasis, providing a safe and comfortable private space in the public sphere. The Ladies Rest Room is one example of the non-euphemistic use of the term: literally, a place to rest. Historically such rooms pre-dated the washroom and washrooms were added afterwards. Subsequent integrated designs resulted in the &quot;women&#x27;s restroom lounge&quot;.

A notable early example of a public toilet in the United States is the Old School Privy. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright claimed to have &quot;invented the hung wall for the w.c. (easier to clean under)&quot; when he designed the Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York in 1904.

According to a 2021 study by QS Supplies, the United States has just 8 public toilets for every 100,000 people, a rate that ties the country with Botswana in terms of access to toilet facilities. In the 1970s there were 50,000 coin-operated public restrooms in the U.S., but they were eliminated by 1980, and public facilities did not replace them.

===South Africa===
During the apartheid years in South Africa, public toilets were usually segregated by race.

==Legislation==

===Mandatory requirements===
In Brazil, there exists no federal law or regulation that makes public toilets provision compulsory. The lack of public toilets across Brazil results in frequent acts of public urination.

=== Sex separation ===

==== United States ====
Massachusetts passed the first law requiring sex separation of public toilets in 1887. By 1920, this was mandated in 43 states.

In jurisdictions using the Uniform Plumbing Code in the U.S., sex separation is a legal mandate via the building code.

=== Toilets for employees and customers ===
Various countries have legislation stipulating how many public toilets are required in a given area for employees or for customers.

==== United States ====
The Restroom Access Act is legislation several U.S. States passed that requires retail establishments with toilet facilities for employees to also allow customers to use the facilities if the customer suffers from an inflammatory bowel disease or other medical condition requiring immediate access to a toilet.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992&quot; requires businesses to provide toilets for their employees, along with washing facilities including soap or other suitable means of cleaning. The &quot;Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Approved Code of Practice and Guidance L24&quot;, available from Health and Safety Executive Books, outlines guidance on the number of toilets to provide and the type of washing facilities associated with them.

Local authorities are not legally required to provide public toilets, and while in 2008 the House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee called for a duty on local authorities to develop a public toilet strategy, the Government rejected the proposal.

In 2022 the UK Government Equality Minister Kemi Badenoch announced plans to make provision of single-sex toilets compulsory in new public buildings above a certain size. The technical review consultation on increasing accessibility and provision of toilets for men and women in municipal and private sector locations outlined the context in a call for evidence to be submitted:

== Equality of access ==
The presence or absence of public toilets has also long been a reflection of a society&#x27;s class inequalities and social hierarchies.

In the UK the number of public toilets fell by nearly 20% from 3,154 in 2015/16 to 2,556 in 2020/21 This loss leads to health and mobility inequality issues for a range of people, including the homeless, disabled, outdoor workers and those whose illnesses mean that they frequently need to access a toilet. The decline of the great British public toilet is described by the Royal Society for Public Health as creating a “urinary leash” which restricts how far people can travel out from their homes.

=== Access for females ===

The lack of public toilets for females reflects their exclusion from the public sphere in the Victorian era. During this period, after leaving their parents&#x27; home, women were expected to maintain careers as homemakers and wives. Thus, safe and private public toilets were rarely available for women. The result was that they were often restricted in how far they could travel away from home without returning. Alternatively, they had to make do in the public streets as best they could. They often experienced sexual harassment as men tried to &quot;sneak a peek&quot; or otherwise bothered them. Some females experienced even worse if they could not secure safety and privacy even at home or in their workplaces. These problems continue for women and girls in all parts of the world.

The practice of pay toilets emerged in the US in the late 19th century. In these spaces, public toilets could only be accessed by paying a fee. Sex-separated pay toilets were available at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair (US) in 1893. Females complained that these were practically unavailable to them; authorities allowed them to be free, but on Fridays only. In the twentieth century, activist groups in the U.S., including the Committee to End Pay Toilets in America, claimed that such practices disadvantaged women and girls because men and boys did not have to pay for urinals. As an act of protest against this phenomenon, in 1969 California Assemblywoman March Fong Eu destroyed a toilet on the steps of the California State Capitol. By the 1990s most US jurisdictions had migrated away from pay toilets. Until 1992, U.S. female senators had to use toilets located on different floor levels than the ones they were working on, a reflection of their intrusion in an all-male profession.

While some public facilities were available to females in London by 1890, there were many fewer than those available to males.

Toilets also were assigned strong moral overtones. While public water closets were considered necessary for sanitation reasons, they were viewed as offending public sensibilities. It has been said that because public facilities were associated with access to public spaces, extending these rights to women was viewed as &quot;immoral&quot; and an &quot;abomination&quot;. As a result of Victorian era codes, women were delegated to the private sphere, away from the public, fulfilling their roles as dutiful wives and mothers where any association with sexuality or private body parts was taboo. For women, the female lavatory in a public space was associated with danger and immoral sexual conduct.

According to World Bank data from 2017, over 500 million females lacked access to sanitation facilities to go to the bathroom or manage menstrual hygiene. Risk of sexual assault is high, in India as high as 50%. Amnesty International includes sex-separated toilets among its list of suggested measures to ensure the safety of women and girls in schools.

In many places the queues for the female toilets are longer than those for the males; efforts to deal with this are known as potty parity. It has been estimated that females can take up to 50% longer in the toilet. The reasons given include the requirement to use a cubicle rather than a urinal, pregnancy, managing menstruation, health conditions (such as cystitis), clothing design, and helping others. Women are more likely to be accompanied by very young children, disabled, or older people.

=== Access for African-American people (racial segregation) ===
After slavery ended in the United States, southern states attempted to replicate social economic oppression by passing laws requiring that blacks and whites be separated in all public and private venues. Racial segregation included public toilets, mandated by Jim Crow laws prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Justifications provided for segregated facilities included &quot;protection of a certain group, privacy, cleanliness, and morality.” This segregation imposed significant restrictions on the lives of African-Americans. Strategies to keep African-Americans out of sight included the &quot;basement solution,&quot; which involved locating public toilets for black people in the basement next to janitor supply rooms. Black workers often had to walk long distances to get to the toilets they were assigned.

Those who were able to afford cars could avoid the indignities of segregated trains and buses, but they faced the difficulty of finding a public toilet they were allowed to use. Courtland Milloy of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; recalled that on cross-country road trips in the 1950s his parents were reluctant to stop the car to allow the children to relieve themselves – it just was not safe. One solution to this was to carry a portable toilet (a sort of bucket-like arrangement) in the trunk of the car. This treatment led to the creation of &quot;The Negro Motorist Green Book&quot;, an annually updated guidebook. Once the traveler found the correct &quot;colored restroom&quot;, it could serve &quot;as a respite from the insults of the white world&quot;, akin to what is now called safe space.

Following the 1941 executive order which prohibited “discrimination in the employment of workers in defence industries or government,” white women refused to share bathrooms with black women throughout the South. Engaging in numerous labor strikes and walkouts against Fair Employment Practice Committee politics, they erroneously claimed that racial integration would cause them to catch syphilis from toilet seats. Similar arguments equating equal access to restrooms with contracting venereal diseases were made by white women after the 1954 court ruling against segregated public schools which led to the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School.

Samuel Younge Jr., then a student at Tuskegee Institute, was murdered in 1966 after trying to use a &quot;whites-only&quot; restroom. He was the first black college student to be killed for his actions supporting the Civil Rights Movement.

=== Access for people with disabilities ===
Public toilets have frequently been inaccessible to people with disabilities. In the United States, all public toilets in federal buildings were required to be accessible to people with disabilities by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. These requirements were extended to all public buildings by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

=== Access for transgender and gender non-conforming people ===
Access to public toilets for transgender and gender non-conforming people is often contested. In the United States, various bathroom bills have been put forward to define who can have public toilet access, and on what terms. Many of these bills seek to criminalize usage by people whose gender identity does not match the sex on their birth certificates.

A variety of reasons have been put forward for these measures, including protecting the privacy of females, avoidance of retraumatization in females affected by male violence, and to protect females from being assaulted by males donning disguises, although there is no evidence of the latter ever having occurred in the past. The UK&#x27;s Equality and Human Rights Commission published guidance in 2022 outlining scenarios where it considered exclusion of transgender people from single-sex spaces to be justifiable and proportionate. While transgender public toilet usage has been labelled as a moral panic, the ongoing discourse continues to have significant impacts on this group.

==Health aspects==

=== Health problems from lack of public toilets ===
Public toilets play a role in community health and individual well-being. Where toilets are available, people can enjoy outings and physical activities in their communities. By letting people get out of their cars and onto their feet, bicycles and mass transit, public toilets can contribute to improved environmental health. Mental well-being is enhanced when people are out with families and friends and know a place &quot;to go&quot; is available.

Public toilets also serve people who are &quot;toilet challenged&quot;. First, some people need to go very frequently, including young and old people, people who are pregnant or menstruating, and those with some medical conditions. Second, some people need toilet access urgently, suddenly and without warning: such as those with chronic conditions such as Crohn&#x27;s disease and colitis, and those temporarily afflicted with food-borne illnesses.

The inability to satisfy essential physiological needs because no toilet is available contributes to health issues such as urinary tract infections, kidney infections, and digestive problems, which can later develop into severe health problems. Inadequate access to a public toilets when required can lead to substantial problems for people with prostate problems, people who are menstruating or going through the menopause, and people with urinary and fecal incontinence.

A 2015 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 8% of transgender Americans reported having developed urinary tract infections, kidney infections, and other kidney-related problems as a result of avoiding, or not being granted access to, the facilities. In another survey, the group DC Trans Coalition found that 54% of its respondents (located in Washington, DC) reported physical problems from avoiding using public toilets, such as dehydration, kidney infections, and urinary tract infections.

According to the Government of Australia, more than 3.8 million Australians of all ages are estimated to suffer continence issues. This represents 18% of the Australian population. Therefore, the Department of Health and Ageing maintains the National Public Toilet Map to enable the public to find the closest facility.

Workers have legal rights to access a toilet during their work day. In the United States, the Department of Labor&#x27;s Occupational Health and Safety protects workers&#x27; rights to toilet breaks because of the documented health risks. This protected right to a toilet is a function of the workplace and is lost when workers leave the workplace.

If bus and truck drivers on timed schedules have difficulty in accessing toilets, this puts them at risk of bladder and digestive health problems. Furthermore, if the concentration of a driver in urgent need is compromised, it becomes a broader public safety concern.

==Design==
=== Entry ===

====Doorless entry====
Modern public toilets may be designed with a labyrinth entrance (doorless entry), which prevents the spread of disease that might otherwise occur when coming in contact with a door. Doorless entry provides visual privacy while simultaneously offering a measure of security by allowing the passage of sound. Doorless entry also helps deter vandalism; fewer audible clues to another person entering discourages some vandals. Doorless entry may also be achieved simply by keeping an existing door propped open, closed only when necessary.

==== Coin operated entry ====
Pay toilets usually have some form of coin operated turnstile, or they have an attendant who collects the fee.

=== Privacy ===

People often expect a high level of privacy when using public toilets. Privacy expectations may include toilet cubicles, cubicle doors, urinal partitions and similar.

The World Health Organization states that toilets should be &quot;suitable, private and safe to use for all intended users, taking into consideration their gender, age and physical mobility (e.g. disabled, sick etc.)&quot; and &quot;All shared or public toilets should have [...] doors that can be locked from the inside, and lights&quot;.

=== Service access ===
Modern public toilets often have a service entrance, utilities passage, and the like, that run behind all the fixtures. Sensors are installed in a separate room, behind the fixtures. Usually, the separate room is just a narrow corridor or passageway.

===Sensors===

Sensor-operated fixtures (faucets, soap dispensers, hand dryers, paper towel dispensers) prevent the spread of disease by allowing patrons to circumvent the need to touch common surfaces. Sensor-operated toilets also help conserve water by limiting the amount used per flush, and require less routine maintenance. Each sensor views through a small window into each fixture. Sometimes the metal plates that house the sensor windows are bolted on from behind, to prevent tampering. Additionally, all of the electrical equipment is safely behind the walls, so that there is no danger of electric shock. However, a residual-current device must be used for all such electrical equipment.

Some public toilets have an automatic sensor-controlled flushing system that flushes the toilet when the user steps away from the sensor. They might also have an additional button that the user can push to provide a second flush.

=== Urinals ===

Urinals for males are common in public toilets as they are more space efficient than toilets (for urination). Urinals in public toilets are common in Western countries but less so in Muslim countries, partly due to Islamic toilet etiquette rules. Urinals for women exist but are rare. Urinals can be with automatic or manual flushing, or without flush water as is the case for waterless urinals. They can be arranged as single sanitary fixtures (with or without privacy walls) or in a trough design without privacy walls. The body posture for users of urinals is specifically the standing position. Compared with urination in a general-purpose toilet, usage is faster and more sanitary because at the urinal there are no fecal germs, no additional doors or locks to touch, and no seat to turn up. A urinal takes less space, is simpler, and consumes less water per flush (or even no water at all) than a flush toilet. Urinal setups can have individual urinals (with or without privacy partitions) or a communal urinal (also called a trough urinal) which is used by multiple men.
===Lighting===
Service lighting consisting of windows that run all the way around the outside of the toilet using electric lights behind the windows, to create the illusion of extensive natural light, even when the toilets are underground or otherwise do not have access to natural light. The windows are sometimes made of glass brick, permanently cemented in place. Lighting installed in service tunnels that run around the outside of the toilets provides optimum safety from electrical shock (keeping the lights outside the toilet), hygiene (no cracks or openings), security (no way for vandals to access the light bulbs), and aesthetics (clean architectural lines that maintain a continuity of whatever aesthetic design is present, e.g., the raw industrial urban aesthetic that works well with glass brick).

===Cisterns (tanks)===
Older toilets infrequently have service ducts, and often in old toilets that have been modernized, the toilet cistern is hidden in a tiled over purpose-built &#x27;box&#x27;. Often old toilets still have high-level cisterns in the service ducts. On the outside, the toilet is flushed by a handle (just like an ordinary low-level cistern toilet) although behind the wall this handle activates a chain. Sometimes a long flushing trough is used to allow closets to be flushed repeatedly without waiting for the cistern to refill. This trend of hiding cisterns and fittings behind the walls started in the late 1930s in the United States and in the United Kingdom from the 1950s, and by the late 1960s it was unusual for toilet cisterns to be visible in public toilets. In some buildings such as schools, however, a cistern can still be visible, although high-level cisterns had become outdated by the 1970s. Many schools now have low-level cisterns.

=== Hand drying options ===

An option for hand drying is usually provided next to the sink. This can be either a paper towel dispenser (sometimes they have auto-sensors for touchless dispensing) or a mechanical hand dryer (used manually or with auto-sensors). Drying of washed hands is important for convenience but also because wet hands are more easily recontaminated. Paper towels are more hygienic than electric air dryers.

===Other fixtures===
Public toilets by their nature see heavy usage. Some high-vandalism settings, such as beaches or stadiums, will use metal toilets. Public toilets generally contain several of the following fixtures.

====In the lockable cubicle (stall)====
*Toilet cubicle door 
*Toilet with toilet seat; whereas a home toilet seat has a lid, a public toilet may or may not, and may not even have a seat
*Toilet paper, often within a lockable dispenser
*Coat hook
*&quot;Pull-down&quot; purse holder
* sanitary protection bin for menstrual products; this may be classified as clinical waste and be subject to special regulations concerning disposal
*Dispenser for flushable paper toilet seat covers
* Toilet cubicle door lock sign. The toilet cubicle door lock signs are indicated in either colour: Vacant is marked in green, while Engaged is marked in red

====At the point of handwashing====

*Faucets (taps); some are at a lower level for children and wheelchair users
*Antiseptic hand-wash dispenser or soap dispensers, pump bottles or auto dispensers (not commonly supplied)
*Mirror (usually over sinks)
*Waste container / rubbish bin

====Elsewhere====
*Urinals (almost exclusively in public toilets for males; although see female urinal)
*Vending machines dispensing condoms, diapers (nappies), painkillers, energy drinks, perfume, breath mints, facial tissue, confectionery, undergarments, swimwear, soap, sex toys, or sanitary napkins or tampons
*Air fresheners or odour control systems
*Infant changing table, often fold-down (usually in women&#x27;s rooms, but increasingly also in men&#x27;s rooms). They are sometimes placed within a, usually large, toilet cubicle.
*Sometimes showers are also present, often with soap, shampoo, or similar dispensers (often at truck stops)

== Cleaning, maintenance and management ==
Thorough cleaning and maintenance are important for public toilets. This task is usually performed by a &quot;public toilet attendant&quot; (who is there during an entire shift) or by professional cleaning staff. They maintain and clean the facilities, ensuring that toilet paper, soap, paper towels, and other necessary items are kept stocked.

Public toilets need both periodic maintenance and emergency cleaning. Volunteer-managed facilities may also be an option in some cases.

There are now durable options for restroom stall materials such as solid plastic that were designed to help fight vandalism. Solid plastic allows for scratches to be less noticeable due to the solid color throughout the product compared to powder coated steel. Powder coated steel chips easily lead to obvious damage compared with solid plastic. Solid plastic is also easier to clean and maintain in public restrooms with high traffic volumes.

==Costs and economics==

===User fees===

Toilets that require the user to pay may be street furniture or be inside a building, e.g. a shopping mall, department store, or railway station. The reason for charging money is usually for the maintenance of the equipment. Paying to use a toilet can be traced back almost 2,000 years — the Roman emperor Vespasian is believed to have begun charging his citizens to use toilet facilities 74 AD. The payment may be taken by a bathroom attendant, or by a coin-operated turnstile or cubicle door. (see John Nevil Maskelyne, who invented a door lock requiring the insertion of a penny coin, hence the euphemism to &quot;spend a penny&quot;) The first pay toilet in the United States was installed in 1910 in Terre Haute, Indiana.

===Privatization and closures===
In some places, the provision of public toilet facilities is under great pressure. One response by public authorities is to close the buildings, often citing criminal activity. The United Kingdom government austerity programme has led to major council cut-backs to public toilet provision, with knock-on effects on the public realm as a whole. Some of the buildings, particularly the underground ones, are sold and used for other purposes, e.g. as a bar.

Another response is to privatise the toilets, so that a public good is provided by a contractor, just as private prisons are. The toilets may fall under the category of privately owned public space - anyone can use them, but the land ultimately belongs to the corporation in question. When toilets that have been privatised are improperly run, or closed, there may be calls to take them back into the control of the public authority.

==Society and culture==

===Unisex (gender neutral)===

Public toilets are often separated by sex. In many cultures, this separation is so characteristic that pictograms of a man or a woman often suffice to indicate the facility, without explicit reference to the fixtures themselves. In restaurants and other private locations, the identifications can be designed to match the decoration of the premises. Toilet facilities for people with disabilities, especially those reliant on a wheelchair, may be either gender-specific or unisex. Gender-neutral toilets are usual in cases where sex-separated ones are not practical, such as in aircraft lavatories and passenger train toilets.

In the 21st century, with support from the transgender rights movement, some initiatives have called for gender-neutral public toilets, also called unisex public toilets (also called gender-inclusive, or all-gender). These may be instead of, or in addition to, gendered toilets, depending on the circumstances. Many groups are re-imagining what public toilets can look like; for instance, architect Joel Sanders, transgender historian Susan Stryker, and legal scholar Terry Kogan launched &quot;Stalled!,&quot; an open source website which offers lectures, workshops, and design guidelines for unisex public toilets.

In addition to accommodating transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, gender-neutral public toilets facilitate usage for people who may require assistance from a caretaker of another gender, such as people with disabilities, elderly people, and children.

An additional consideration with regard to gendered public restrooms is the availability of baby changing tables. Sometimes, these tables have only been installed in women&#x27;s restrooms, owing to stereotypical assumptions that only women were likely to be accompanied by babies needing to have their diapers changed. This can be an impediment for fathers with their children and other male caregivers. Advocates have worked for changing tables to be installed in men&#x27;s restrooms. Unisex washrooms would provide access to either regardless.

===Graffiti and street art===


Public toilets have long been associated with graffiti, often of a transgressive, gossipy, or low-brow humorous nature (cf. toilet humour). The word &quot;latrinalia&quot;—from &quot;latrine&quot; (toilet) and &quot;-alia&quot; (a collection)—was coined to describe this kind of graffiti. A famous example of such artwork was featured on the album cover of the satirical Tony Award Broadway musical &quot;Urinetown&quot;, using felt-tip pen scribblings.

As graffiti merged into street art, so some public street-level toilets began to make a feature of their visibility. The Hundertwasser toilet block is a colourful example in Kawakawa, New Zealand, designed by an Austrian artist and viewed as a tourist draw in a small town.

===Drugs, vandalism and violent crime===
Some public toilets are known for drug-taking and drug-selling, as well as vandalism. This type of criminal activity is associated with all &quot;neglected, unsupervised buildings&quot;, not just toilets, and good cleanliness and maintenance, and ideally an attendant on the premises, can act as a protection against these problems.

Violent crime inside public toilets can be a problem in areas where the rate of such crimes in general is very high. In South Africa, for instance, many people have reported being afraid to use public toilets. There have been several highly publicized murders in public toilets, such as the Seocho-dong public toilet murder case in South Korea in 2016. In the US, an infamous case was the murder of a 9-year-old boy in 1998 in a San Diego county public toilet.

Increasing public toilet provision can help to protect women from violent attacks. Research studies have found increased risk of women and girls being raped where there is limited or no access to safe toilets at night.

Several billion people lack access to improved water and sanitation and must travel long distances or wait until nighttime to defecate under cover of darkness. Women and girls managing menstruation increases their water and sanitation requirements for several days each month. Amongst the UN sustainable development goals, there is specific reference to achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls in vulnerable situations (indicator 6.2).

A study conducted by the UCLA School of Law&#x27;s Williams Institute found no significant change in the number of crimes since the passage of various laws that enable transgender public toilet usage. Transgender and gender non-conforming people are at risk of violence when using the public toilet (see: trans bashing). A 2015 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 59% of transgender Americans avoided using public facilities for fear of confrontation. This landmark study, which included 27,715 respondents, found that 24% of respondents had their presence in the restroom questioned, 12% had experienced verbal harassment, physical assault, or sexual assault when attempting to use the restroom, and 9% were denied access entirely. Several studies have found that preventing transgender people from using public toilets has negative mental health impacts, leading to a higher risk of suicide.

===Anonymous sex===

Before the gay liberation movement, public toilets were amongst the few places where men too young to enter gay bars legally could meet others who they knew with certainty to be gay. Many, if not most, gay and bisexual men at the time were closeted, and almost no public gay social groups were available for those under legal drinking age. The privacy and anonymity public toilets provided made them a convenient and attractive location to engage in sexual acts then.

Sexual acts in public toilets are outlawed in many jurisdictions (e.g. the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in the UK). It is likely that the element of risk involved in cottaging makes it an attractive activity to some.

===Symbols in unicode===
Unicode provides several symbols for public toilets.
== Toilets in particular locations ==

===Shopping centres===
Customers often expect retail stores and shopping centres to offer public toilets. Customers rank complimentary toilets highly, and their availability influences shopping behaviour. By offering appropriate customer toilets, retail stores and shopping centres may enhance their profits and image; however, many retailers pay insufficient attention to their customer toilet facilities. Due to the potential of customer toilets to increase profits and improve store image, retailers could benefit from regarding toilets as a marketing investment rather than a property expense. Some businesses, like Starbucks, have officially opted to let anyone use their toilets, without having to purchase anything. This decision was made after a highly publicized instance of racial profiling.

===Schools===

Lack of adequate school toilets is a very serious problem in many developing countries, and contributes to many problems from poor child health to school dropouts. Many pit latrines are not adequately built for young children, which has resulted in the tragic consequence of children dying by falling inside the hole. Globally, about 620 million children do not have adequate toilets at school, around 900 million cannot wash their hands properly, and almost half of schools do not provide soap.

The situation of inadequate school toilets violates children&#x27;s right to education and right to water and sanitation. Such situations are common in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and South Asia, but also in other regions. For example, in the Caucasus and Central Asia, 30% of schools do not provide adequate toilets and 37% of schools do not have access to adequate water supplies. The presence of soap and toilet paper is very important, but is largely non-existent in many regions. Missing or inadequate doors and partitioning are observed in both high- and low-income countries, which can affect children&#x27;s self-esteem, especially around puberty; in the case of girls, lack of menstrual hygiene management and privacy (such as the availability of functional toilet doors with locks, disposal facilities and menstrual hygiene products in schools, soap and toilet paper) can severely impact upon their well-being and is considered a form of violation of girls&#x27; rights.

In Japan, there is still squat toilets in most schools, which most Japanese children are not able to use or find it uncomfortable, which causes constipation.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has funded several research projects for provision of community, shared or school toilets in developing countries since 2011, when they launched their &quot;Reinvent the Toilet Challenge&quot;.

=== Prisons ===
It is today accepted in the countries of the Council of Europe that a lack of basic privacy is a violation of fundamental rights. For example, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in &quot;Szafrański v. Poland&quot; (2015) that the forcing of prisoners to use the toilet without adequate privacy amounts to a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

== In Vietnam ==
In Vietnam, many cities, especially large and densely populated cities, are experiencing a severe shortage of public toilets due to lack of land for toilet construction. The general situation of toilets in Vietnam is insufficient, poorly installed, and dirty. Many public places do not have toilets, leading to the situation of littering everywhere.

<text>Mordecai ben Avraham Yoffe (or Jaffe or Joffe) ( 1530 – 7 March 1612; Hebrew: מרדכי בן אברהם יפה) was a Rabbi, Rosh yeshiva and posek. He is best known as author of &quot;Levush Malkhus&quot;, a ten-volume codification of Jewish law that particularly stressed the customs of the Jews of Eastern Europe. He is known as &quot;the Levush&quot; or &quot;the Ba&#x27;al Halevushim&quot;, for this work.

==Biography==
Yoffe was born in Prague; he could count amongst his ancestors Rashi and before him Hillel, Elnathan (governor of Judea) and ultimately back to King David. His father, Abraham b. Joseph, was a pupil of Abraham ben Abigdor.

The &quot;Levush&quot; studied under Moses Isserles and Solomon Luria; Mattithiah b. Solomon Delacrut was his teacher in Kabbalah. Yoffe also studied philosophy, astronomy, and mathematics (apparently at the insistence of Isserles).

He was Rosh Yeshiva in Prague until 1561, when, by order of the emperor Ferdinand, the Jews were expelled from Bohemia. Yoffe then went to Venice and studied astronomy (1561–71). In 1572 he was elected rabbi of Grodno; in 1588, rabbi of Lublin, where he became one of the leaders of the Council of Four Lands. Later Yoffe accepted the rabbinate of Kremenetz. In 1592 he was called as rabbi to Prague; from 1599 until his death he occupied the position of chief rabbi of Posen.

In addition to his Torah study, writing and teaching he was involved with communal needs, and attended the fairs at Yaroslav and Lublin, where community leaders and rabbis from large communities met to discuss matters of general interest. These meetings were the forerunners of the Council of the Four Lands and the Council of Lithuania.

He is also a patriarch of the Jaffe family.

A different Rabbi Mordecai Yoffe - Mordecai ben Moses Yoffe - is known for the controversy over his 1549 appointment as rabbi of Grodno, which had to be settled by Queen Bona, and eventually led the Lithuanian government to formalize many of the procedures of the Jewish community.

==Works==
Levush Malkhus is a work of practical halacha, accompanied by the reasons behind the various halachic decisions according to logic and earlier sources, and includes sections on Torah commentary, philosophy, and mysticism. This work was divided into ten sections known as &quot;levushim&quot; (garments, or &quot;attires&quot;).

While still in his youth, Rabbi Yoffe had the idea to compile a book on Jewish law, which would be used for making halachic decisions. The appearance of R&#x27; Yosef Caro&#x27;s Shulchan Arukh, a digest of his Beit Yosef, led Rabbi Yoffe to consider whether he should continue writing his own work. On reflection, he concluded that there was room for it since it would contain &quot;those laws observed by the Ashkenazi Jews of Bohemia.&quot; When R&#x27; Moshe Isserles&#x27; gloss to the Shulḥan Arukh (called &quot;Mappah&quot;) appeared in Cracow in 1578, Rabbi Yoffe felt that Rabbi Isserles had been too brief as had Rav Yosef Caro in the Shulḥan Arukh, and decided to resume his original work, &quot;that will be midway between the two extremes: the lengthy Beit Yosef of Caro on the one hand, and on the other Rav Yosef Caro&#x27;s Shulḥan Arukh together with the Mappah of Rabbi Isserles, which is too brief.&quot; In all, Rabbi Yoffe worked on this book almost 50 years. However, after completing his book he was confronted by another Rabbi who had also written a similar work, although not as extensive as Rabbi Yoffe&#x27;s. They reached an agreement to publish Rabbi Yoffe&#x27;s book and to present the other Rabbi&#x27;s additional comments in glosses (hagahos) throughout the book.

The work is organised as follows. The first five &quot;attires&quot; are devoted to the laws expounded in Rav Yosef Caro&#x27;s Beit Yosef; the sixth, &quot;Ha-Orah&quot; is an elucidation of Rashi&#x27;s biblical commentary; the seventh, &quot;Simḥah ve-Sason&quot;, contains sermons for holidays and weddings. Rabbi Yoffe collectively termed the last three, &quot;rabbinic robes,&quot; considering that these should be learned by &quot;every student in that order – philosophy, astronomy, and Kabbalah.&quot; These are: the eighth, &quot;Pinnat Yikrat&quot;, is a commentary on Maimonides&#x27; Guide of the Perplexed; the ninth, &quot;Eder Yakar&quot;, is a commentary on the laws of the Jewish calendar according to Maimonides and an additional commentary on Abraham bar Hiyya&#x27;s geographical-astronomical &quot;Tzurat ha-Aretz&quot;; the tenth, &quot;Even Yikrat&quot;, is on Menahem Recanati&#x27;s commentary on the Torah.

The Levush is an exception among the codifiers in treating ritual-legal matters from a kabbalistic standpoint; his approach, to a certain extent, &quot;tended to draw together the Talmudists and kabbalists, otherwise in danger of an open breach&quot;.

<text>HotSauce (code-named Project X) was experimental software developed by Apple Computer as a sample application of its Meta Content Framework. HotSauce generated a 3D visualization of the contents of an MCF file, for example, a website sitemap. It could also be used to navigate the contents of the user&#x27;s hard drive.

The interface presented the different nodes as &quot;bubbles&quot; floating in space, to which users could &quot;fly&quot; to, in an effect similar to the one found later in Apple&#x27;s Time Machine backup software. 

Apple offered beta versions of HotSauce as a web browser plug-in for the classic Mac OS and Microsoft Windows and a stand-alone application.

HotSauce was never released in a final version and while MCF was adopted by thousands of websites, including Yahoo!, most users saw no point in navigating them in a 3D space. The project was discontinued along with MCF shortly after Steve Jobs&#x27; return to the company in 1997.

<text>Lough Allen () is a lake on the River Shannon in northeastern Connacht, Ireland. Most of the lake is in County Leitrim, with a smaller part in County Roscommon. The lake lies to the south of the River Shannon&#x27;s source, near the Iron Mountains, and is the uppermost of the three main lakes on the river. The other two, Lough Ree and Lough Derg are much further to the south.

==Geography==
Lough Allen, out of which the Shannon takes its source, is nine miles long, and three miles wide. The lake is shaped like an isosceles triangle. The Shannon enters the lake at the wider northern end and leaves the lake at the narrow southern end. Other rivers that feed the lake include the Diffagher (northwest), the Yellow (northeast), the Stoney (east) and the Arigna (southwest). The R280 regional road skirts the west side of the lake, while the R207 follows the east bank, from Ballinagleragh to Drumshanbo. The R200 road is on the north side of the lake, traveling west from Dowra to Drumkeeran. Slieve Anierin lie to the east of Lough Allen. There has been speculation that notable reserves of oil and gas lie beneath the Allen basin.

==Ecology==
Between , water quality was reported to be excellent with an oligotrophic rating. The pike population is the &quot;native Irish strain&quot; ( meaning &#x27;Irish Pike&#x27;) not the other European Pike strain ( meaning &#x27;strange or foreign fish&#x27;). The ecology of Lough Allen, and other Irish waterways, remain threatened by curly waterweed, zebra mussel, and freshwater clam invasive species.

==Prehistory==
Significant traces of Mesolithic inhabitation have been found around the lakeshore, with hundreds of stone tools collected. In total almost 1000 stone tools were collected during a set of surveys by Killian Driscoll, and 95% were formed on silicified dolomite, which outcrops locally. The remaining 5% were formed from flint, chert and quartz, along with the
shale/mudstone and basalt ground/polished axes. The majority of the stone tools are characteristic of the Later Mesolithic, with possible evidence for the Early Mesolithic and limited evidence for Neolithic activity. The assemblage includes a number of stone axes and axe roughouts, and the roughouts represent the first recorded, by the Irish Stone Axe Project, as found in a lakeside context in Ireland, with most previously provenanced examples coming from axe quarry sites.

==History==

===Ironworks===
Iron ore has been extracted at Slieve Anierin for millennia. From the early 17th century a number of mines and works were conveniently contiguous to Lough Allen, allowing for the transportation of iron ore over water to the ironworks in boats of up to forty tons. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 nearly all ironworks were destroyed, but many were revived by the English after the Irish Confederate Wars. Extensive forests around Lough Allen before the 17th century were denuded to make charcoal for ironworks, the industry later collapsing in the 19th century.

===Reservoir===
On the construction of the Shannon hydroelectric scheme in 1925–9, the lake became a storage reservoir for the power station nearly 100 miles away, with sluices to control the flow into the river. This helps to maintain the flow during dry periods and manage flooding at other times. It made the Lough Allen Canal, which was rarely used by this time, unusable until restored in 1996.

===Regattas===
In the mid-19th century, regattas were held by M. O&#x27;Conor at Lough Allen Island which is also known as O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Island at the southern end of the lake. The house is destroyed, and only a ruin now exists. Regatta parties were held at Birchill&#x27;s House, Blackrock. E.K. Tenison of Kilronan Castle, the photographer, Captain Tottenham, Captain Birchill and Francis la Touche attended the Regatta parties. Among the yachts competing in the regattas were &#x27;Corsair&#x27;, &#x27;Avenger&#x27;, &#x27;Querida&#x27;, &#x27;Meta&#x27; and &#x27;Shamrock&#x27;. The Water Wags from Dun Laoghaire, organised a regatta on Lough Allen, in September 2015, for their 14&#x27;-3&quot; long historic open clinker dinghies. competed in a regatta in 2014, including Penelope (1933), Scallywag, Swift, Moosmie (1910), Mollie, Chloe, Marie Louise (1927) and Good Hope. This was probably the first regatta on the lake since the mid-19th century.

<doc id="1053499" wikidata="Q733225" url="?curid=1053499" title="Albert Memmi">
<text>Albert Memmi (; 15 December 1920 – 22 May 2020) was a French-Tunisian writer and essayist of Tunisian Jewish origins. A prominent intellectual, his nonfiction books and novels explored his complex identity as an anti-imperialist, deeply related to his ardent Zionism. 

== Biography ==
Memmi was born in Tunis, French Tunisia in December 1920, one of 13 children of Tunisian Jewish Berber Maïra (or Marguerite) Sarfati and Tunisian-Italian Jewish Fradji (or Fraji, or François) Memmi, a saddle maker. He grew up speaking French and Tunisian-Judeo-Arabic. During the Nazi occupation of Tunisia, Memmi was imprisoned in a forced labor camp from which he later escaped.

Memmi started Hebrew school when he was 4. He was educated in French primary schools, and continued his secondary studies at the prestigious Lycée Carnot de Tunis in Tunis, where he graduated in 1939. During World War II, he was studying philosophy at the University of Algiers when France&#x27;s collaborationist Vichy regime implemented anti-Semitic laws. As a result, he was expelled from the university and subsequently sent to a labor camp in eastern Tunisia. After the war, Memmi resumed his studies at the Sorbonne in Paris and married Marie-Germaine Dubach, a French Catholic, with whom he had three children. The family returned to Tunis in 1951, where Memmi taught high school. 

Memmi became a professor at the Sorbonne and earned his doctorate there in 1970. In 1975, he was appointed as a director of the School of Higher Studies in Social Sciences. He also held positions at the École des hautes études commerciales and at the University of Nanterre.

Memmi grappled with a profound sense of alienation, particularly his own. While he actively supported Tunisia&#x27;s independence, once it was achieved, he chose to leave the newly formed Muslim state. He spent the following two-thirds of his life in France, effectively in self-imposed exile. Despite this, Memmi expressed that his true homeland was not the French nation, but the French language. In &quot;The Pillar of Salt&quot;, he wrote, &#x27;I am a Tunisian, but of French culture. I am Tunisian, but Jewish, which means that I am politically and socially an outcast. I speak the language of the country with a particular accent and emotionally I have nothing in common with Muslims. I am a Jew who has broken with the Jewish religion and the ghetto, is ignorant of Jewish culture and detests the middle class.&#x27;&quot;

He died in May 2020, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, at the age of 99.

==Writings==
Memmi found himself at the crossroads of three cultures, and based his work on the difficulty of finding a balance between the East and the West.

Memmi&#x27;s well-regarded first novel, &quot;La statue de sel&quot; (translated as &quot;The Pillar of Salt&quot;), was published in 1953 with a preface by Albert Camus and was awarded the Fénéon Prize in 1954. His other novels include &quot;Agar&quot; (translated as &quot;Strangers&quot;), &quot;Le Scorpion&quot; (&quot;The Scorpion&quot;), and &quot;Le Desert&quot; (&quot;The Desert&quot;).

His best-known non-fiction work is &quot;The Colonizer and the Colonized&quot;, about the interdependent relationship of the two groups. It was published in 1957, a time when many national liberation movements were active. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote the preface. The work is often read in conjunction with Frantz Fanon&#x27;s &quot;Les damnés de la Terre&quot; (&quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;) and &quot;Peau noire, masques blancs&quot; (&quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot;) and Aimé Césaire&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot;. In October 2006, Memmi&#x27;s follow-up to this work, entitled &quot;Decolonization and the Decolonized&quot;, was published. In this book, Memmi suggests that in the wake of global decolonization, the suffering of former colonies cannot be attributed to the former colonizers, but to the corrupt leaders and governments that control these states.

Memmi&#x27;s related sociological works include &quot;Dominated Man&quot;, &quot;Dependence&quot;, and &quot;Racism&quot;.

Sean P. Hier, in a review of Memmi&#x27;s &quot;Racism&quot;, calls it &quot;well-written and autobiographically informed.&quot; He writes that Memmi&#x27;s main claim is that racism is a &quot;&#x27;lived experience&#x27; arising within human situations which only secondarily become &#x27;social experiences.&#x27; According to Hier, Memmi writes that racism is &quot;endemic to collective human existence.&quot;

Memmi wrote extensively on Jewish identity and the place of the Jew in Muslim North African states after independence, including &quot;Portrait of a Jew&quot;, &quot;Liberation of the Jew&quot; and &quot;Jews and Arabs&quot;.

He was also known for the &quot;Anthology of Maghrebian literature&quot; (written in collaboration) published in 1965 (vol. 1) and 1969 (vol. 2).

Reviewing Memmi&#x27;s fiction, scholar Judith Roumani asserts that the Tunisian writer&#x27;s work &quot;reveals the same philosophical evolution over time from his original viewpoints to less radical but perhaps more realistic positions.&quot; She concludes that &quot;his latest fiction is certainly more innovative and different than his earlier work.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, essayist and critic Richard Locke Albert Memmi&#x27;s earlier novels as memoirs &quot;recorded with a cleareyed sensitivity, a modest candor, and remarkable strength.&quot; He likened Memmi to &quot;a Tunisian Balzac graced with Hemingway&#x27;s radical simplicity and sadness.&quot; Locke further wrote, &quot;But ultimately, it is Memmi&#x27;s heart, not his skill, that moves you: the sights and sounds of Tunis, the childhood memories, the brothers&#x27; sympathetic and contrasting voices, their all-too-human feelings, have a resonance that reawakens for a while the ghost of European humanism.&quot;

In a 2018 article for &quot;The Jewish Review of Books&quot;, Daniel Gordon wrote that Memmi “has combined, perhaps more than any other writer since World War II, the compassion needed to articulate the suffering of oppressed groups with the forthrightness needed to censure them for their own acts of oppression.”

In 1995, Memmi said of his own work: &quot;All of my work has been in sum an inventory of my attachments; all of my work has been, it should be understood, a constant revolt against my attachments; all of my work, for certain, has been an attempt at...reconciliation between the different parts of myself.&quot;

==Refuting scientific racism==

In &quot;Racisme&quot;, Memmi defined racism as a social construction assigning values to biological differences (both real and imagined) “to the advantage of the one defining and deploying them, and to the detriment of the one subjected to that act of definition”. In doing so, he countered three major arguments of scientific racism— a pseudoscientific belief in the existence of empirical evidence in support of racist beliefs. First, that pure and distinct races exist; second, that biologically ‘pure’ races were superior to others; and finally, that superior races had legitimate dominance over others. Memmi opposed this belief, asserting biological differences across human beings correlated with changes in geography, and that biological purity was a particular human fantasy. Memmi also pointed out that no evidence existed in support of the idea of racial purity, and merit, rather than biology, was the only basis of superiority. In this way, Memmi&#x27;s arguments for racism as a social construct were important in refuting the notion of science as a basis for racist thought.

<doc id="1053500" wikidata="Q3062596" url="?curid=1053500" title="DNA extraction">
<text>The first isolation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was done in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher. DNA extraction is the process of isolating DNA from the cells of an organism isolated from a sample, typically a biological sample such as blood, saliva, or tissue. It involves breaking open the cells, removing proteins and other contaminants, and purifying the DNA so that it is free of other cellular components. The purified DNA can then be used for downstream applications such as PCR, sequencing, or cloning. Currently, it is a routine procedure in molecular biology or forensic analyses.

This process can be done in several ways, depending on the type of the sample and the downstream application, the most common methods are: mechanical, chemical and enzymatic lysis, precipitation, purification, and concentration. The specific method used to extract the DNA, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, alcohol precipitation, or silica-based purification.

For the chemical method, many different kits are used for extraction, and selecting the correct one will save time on kit optimization and extraction procedures. PCR sensitivity detection is considered to show the variation between the commercial kits.

There are many different methods for extracting DNA, but some common steps include:

# Lysis: This step involves breaking open the cells to release the DNA. For example, in the case of bacterial cells, a solution of detergent and salt (such as SDS) can be used to disrupt the cell membrane and release the DNA. For plant and animal cells, mechanical or enzymatic methods are often used.
# Precipitation: Once the DNA is released, proteins and other contaminants must be removed. This is typically done by adding a precipitating agent, such as alcohol (such as ethanol or isopropanol), or a salt (such as ammonium acetate). The DNA will form a pellet at the bottom of the solution, while the contaminants will remain in the liquid.
# Purification: After the DNA is precipitated, it is usually further purified by using column-based methods. For example, silica-based spin columns can be used to bind the DNA, while contaminants are washed away. Alternatively, a centrifugation step can be used to purify the DNA by spinning it down to the bottom of a tube.
# Concentration: Finally, the amount of DNA present is usually increased by removing any remaining liquid. This is typically done by using a vacuum centrifugation or a lyophilization (freeze-drying) step.

Some variations on these steps may be used depending on the specific DNA extraction protocol. Additionally, some kits are commercially available that include reagents and protocols specifically tailored to a specific type of sample.

== What does it deliver? ==
DNA extraction is frequently a preliminary step in many diagnostic procedures used to identify environmental viruses and bacteria and diagnose illnesses and hereditary diseases. These methods consist of, but are not limited to:

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique was developed in the 1980s. The basic idea is to use a nucleic acid probe to hybridize nuclear DNA from either interphase cells or metaphase chromosomes attached to a microscopic slide. It is a molecular method used, among other things, to recognize and count particular bacterial groupings.

To recognize, define, and quantify the geographical and temporal patterns in marine bacterioplankton communities, researchers employ a technique called terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP).

Sequencing: Whole or partial genomes and other chromosomal components, ended for comparison with previously published sequences.

== Basic procedure ==
* Cells that are to be studied need to be collected.
* Breaking the cell membranes open exposes the DNA along with the cytoplasm within (cell lysis).
** Lipids from the cell membrane and the nucleus are broken down with detergents and surfactants.
** Breaking down proteins by adding a protease (optional).
** Breaking down RNA by adding an RNase (optional).
* The solution is treated with a concentrated salt solution (saline) to make debris such as broken proteins, lipids, and RNA clump together.
* Centrifugation of the solution, which separates the clumped cellular debris from the DNA.
* DNA purification from detergents, proteins, salts, and reagents is used during the cell lysis step. The most commonly used procedures are:
**Ethanol precipitation usually by ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol. Since DNA is insoluble in these alcohols, it will aggregate together, giving a &quot;pellet&quot; upon centrifugation. Precipitation of DNA is improved by increasing ionic strength, usually by adding sodium acetate.
** Phenol–chloroform extraction in which phenol denatures proteins in the sample. After centrifugation of the sample, denatured proteins stay in the organic phase while the aqueous phase containing nucleic acid is mixed with chloroform to remove phenol residues from the solution.
** Minicolumn purification relies on the fact that the nucleic acids may bind (adsorption) to the solid phase (silica or other) depending on the pH and the salt concentration of the buffer.

Cellular and histone proteins bound to the DNA can be removed either by adding a protease or having precipitated the proteins with sodium or ammonium acetate or extracted them with a phenol-chloroform mixture before the DNA precipitation.

After isolation, the DNA is dissolved in a slightly alkaline buffer, usually in a TE buffer, or in ultra-pure water.

== Common chemicals ==
The most common chemicals used for DNA extraction include:

# Detergents, such as SDS or Tween-20, which are used to break open cells and release the DNA.
# Protease enzymes, such as Proteinase K, which are used to digest proteins that may be binding to the DNA.
# Phenol and chloroform, which are used to separate the DNA from other cellular components.
# Ethanol or isopropanol, which are used to precipitate the DNA.
# Salt, such as NaCl, which is often used to help dissolve the DNA and maintain its stability.
# EDTA, which is used to chelate the metals ions that can damage the DNA.
# Tris-HCL, which is used to maintain the pH at the optimal condition for DNA extraction.

== Method selection ==
Some of the most common DNA extraction methods include organic extraction, Chelex extraction, and solid phase extraction. These methods consistently yield isolated DNA, but they differ in both the quality and the quantity of DNA yielded. When selecting a DNA extraction method, there are multiple factors to consider, including cost, time, safety, and risk of contamination.

Organic extraction involves the addition of incubation in multiple different chemical solutions; including a lysis step, a phenol-chloroform extraction, an ethanol precipitation, and washing steps. Organic extraction is often used in laboratories because it is cheap, and it yields large quantities of pure DNA. Though it is easy, there are many steps involved, and it takes longer than other methods. It also involves the unfavorable use of the toxic chemicals phenol and chloroform, and there is an increased risk of contamination due to transferring the DNA between multiple tubes. Several protocols based on organic extraction of DNA were effectively developed decades ago, though improved and more practical versions of these protocols have also been developed and published in the last years.

The chelex extraction method involves adding the Chelex resin to the sample, boiling the solution, then vortexing and centrifuging it. The cellular materials bind to the Chelex beads, while the DNA is available in the supernatant. The Chelex method is much faster and simpler than organic extraction, and it only requires one tube, which decreases the risk of DNA contamination. Unfortunately, Chelex extraction does not yield as much quantity and the DNA yielded is single-stranded, which means it can only be used for PCR-based analyses and not for RFLP.

Solid phase extraction such as using a spin-column-based extraction method takes advantage of the fact that DNA binds to silica. The sample containing DNA is added to a column containing a silica gel or silica beads and chaotropic salts. The chaotropic salts disrupt the hydrogen bonding between strands and facilitate the binding of the DNA to silica by causing the nucleic acids to become hydrophobic. This exposes the phosphate residues so they are available for adsorption. The DNA binds to the silica, while the rest of the solution is washed out using ethanol to remove chaotropic salts and other unnecessary constituents. The DNA can then be rehydrated with aqueous low-salt solutions allowing for elution of the DNA from the beads.

This method yields high-quality, largely double-stranded DNA which can be used for both PCR and RFLP analysis. This procedure can be automated and has a high throughput, although lower than the phenol-chloroform method. This is a one-step method i.e. the entire procedure is completed in one tube. This lowers the risk of contamination making it very useful for the forensic extraction of DNA. Multiple solid-phase extraction commercial kits are manufactured and marketed by different companies; the only problem is that they are more expensive than organic extraction or Chelex extraction.

==Special types ==
Specific techniques must be chosen for the isolation of DNA from some samples. Typical samples with complicated DNA isolation are:
* archaeological samples containing partially degraded DNA, see ancient DNA
* samples containing inhibitors of subsequent analysis procedures, most notably inhibitors of PCR, such as humic acid from the soil, indigo and other fabric dyes or haemoglobin in blood
* samples from microorganisms with thick cellular walls, for example, yeast
*samples containing mixed DNA from multiple sources

Extrachromosomal DNA is generally easy to isolate, especially plasmids may be easily isolated by cell lysis followed by precipitation of proteins, which traps chromosomal DNA in insoluble fraction and after centrifugation, plasmid DNA can be purified from soluble fraction.

A Hirt DNA Extraction is an isolation of all extrachromosomal DNA in a mammalian cell. The Hirt extraction process gets rid of the high molecular weight nuclear DNA, leaving only low molecular weight mitochondrial DNA and any viral episomes present in the cell.

==Detection of DNA==
A diphenylamine (DPA) indicator will confirm the presence of DNA. This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g. ≥95 °C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore is specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to w-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to produce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined by measuring the intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600 nm with a spectrophotometer and comparing to a standard curve of known DNA concentrations.

Measuring the intensity of absorbance of the DNA solution at wavelengths 260 nm and 280 nm is used as a measure of DNA purity. DNA can be quantified by cutting the DNA with a restriction enzyme, running it on an agarose gel, staining with ethidium bromide (EtBr) or a different stain and comparing the intensity of the DNA with a DNA marker of known concentration.

Using the Southern blot technique, this quantified DNA can be isolated and examined further using PCR and RFLP analysis. These procedures allow differentiation of the repeated sequences within the genome. It is these techniques which forensic scientists use for comparison, identification, and analysis.

== High-molecular-weight DNA extraction method ==
In this method, plant nuclei are isolated by physically grinding tissues and reconstituting the intact nuclei in a unique Nuclear Isolation Buffer (NIB). The plastid DNAs are released from organelles and eliminated with an osmotic buffer by washing and centrifugation. The purified nuclei are then lysed and further cleaned by organic extraction, and the genomic DNA is precipitated with a high concentration of CTAB. The highly pure, high molecular weight gDNA is extracted from the nuclei, dissolved in a high pH buffer, allowing for stable long-term storage.

== DNA storage ==
DNA storage is an important aspect of DNA extraction projects as it ensures the integrity and stability of the extracted DNA for downstream applications.

One common method of DNA storage is ethanol precipitation, which involves adding ethanol and a salt, such as sodium chloride or potassium acetate, to the extracted DNA to precipitate it out of solution. The DNA is then pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 70% ethanol to remove any remaining contaminants. The DNA pellet is then air-dried and resuspended in a buffer, such as Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, for storage.

Another method is freezing the DNA in a buffer such as TE buffer, or in a cryoprotectant such as glycerol or DMSO, at -20 or -80 degrees Celsius. This method preserves the integrity of the DNA and slows down the activity of any enzymes that may degrade it.

It&#x27;s important to note that the choice of storage buffer and conditions will depend on the downstream application for which the DNA is intended. For example, if the DNA is to be used for PCR, it may be stored in TE buffer at 4 degrees Celsius, while if it is to be used for long-term storage or shipping, it may be stored in ethanol at -20 degrees Celsius. The extracted DNA should be regularly checked for its quality and integrity, such as by running a gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometry. The storage conditions should be also noted and controlled, such as the temperature and humidity.

It&#x27;s also important to consider the long-term stability of the DNA and the potential for degradation over time. The extracted DNA should be stored for as short a time as possible, and the conditions for storage should be chosen to minimize the risk of degradation.

In general, the extracted DNA should be stored under the best possible conditions to ensure its stability and integrity for downstream applications.

== Quality control ==
There are several quality control techniques used to ensure the quality of extracted DNA, including:

* Spectrophotometry: This is a widely used method for measuring the concentration and purity of a DNA sample. Spectrophotometry measures the absorbance of a sample at different wavelengths, typically at 260 nm and 280 nm. The ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm is used to determine the purity of the DNA sample.
* Gel electrophoresis: This technique is used to visualize and compare the size and integrity of DNA samples. The DNA is loaded onto an agarose gel and then subjected to an electric field, which causes the DNA to migrate through the gel. The migration of the DNA can be visualized using ethidium bromide, which intercalates into the DNA and fluoresces under UV light.
* Fluorometry: Fluorometry is a method to determine the concentration of nucleic acids by measuring the fluorescence of the sample when excited by a specific wavelength of light. Fluorometry uses dyes that specifically bind to nucleic acids and have a high fluorescence intensity.
* PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a technique that amplifies a specific region of DNA, it is also used as a QC method by amplifying a small fragment of the DNA, if the amplification is successful, it means the extracted DNA is of good quality and it&#x27;s not degraded.
* Qubit Fluorometer: The Qubit Fluorometer is an instrument that uses fluorescent dyes to measure the concentration of DNA and RNA in a sample. It is a quick and sensitive method that can be used to determine the concentration of DNA samples.
* Bioanalyzer: The bioanalyzer is an instrument that uses electrophoresis to separate and analyze DNA, RNA, and protein samples. It can provide detailed information about the size, integrity, and purity of a DNA sample.

<text>Bradford College is a further and higher education college in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, with approximately 25,000 students. The college offers a range of full and part-time courses from introductory level through to postgraduate level and caters for a variety of students, including school leavers, adults wanting to return to education, degree-level students and those seeking professional qualifications.

==HE provision==
Bradford College is one of the FE Colleges with the largest HE provision in England, with approximately 170 full and part-time HE courses.

The College&#x27;s HE provision is currently validated by University of Bolton, having previously been validated by Teesside University.

The move to Teesside University was a result of Leeds Metropolitan University&#x27;s withdrawal from its partnerships with colleges except for foundation degrees.

==History==
In 1832, the Bradford Mechanics Institute was founded. In 1863, the institute had grown to accommodate full-time staff and had its own School of Industrial Design and Art. In 1872 the Bradford MP William Edward Forster opened new buildings in Bridge Street.

On 23 June 1882, the then Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) came to open the new School. They were given a very warm welcome: &quot;From Saltaire Station to the Technical School, a distance of four miles, was one continuous avenue of Venetian masts, streamers, and many coloured banners, while at appropriate points triumphal arches of great magnificence were erected.&quot;

In 1982, the institution was named Bradford and Ilkley Community College, after a merger with Ilkley College, giving the combined college a small satellite campus in the nearby town of Ilkley, north-east of Bradford. This was closed in 1999 and soon after the institution became Bradford College.

In 2002, a merger between the college and the University of Bradford was proposed; this was pursued until the summer of 2003, when the two institutions issued a joint statement calling off the merger. Beginning in 2006 the college underwent a re-brand and unveiled its current logo. A community learning centre, named The Three Valleys Centre, was opened in nearby Keighley in 2007 which hosts a hairdressing and beauty salon (also operating on a commercial basis), as well as I.T and a range of language courses.

As part of the college&#x27;s 175-year celebration, it published a list of 175 famous alumni of the college. This list includes ex-students such as Edward Appleton, Tasmin Archer, David Berglas, Alex Corina, Bob Hardy, David Hockney and Joyce Gould.
Trinity Green, which houses a new sports centre and teaching facilities for construction and engineering students, opened in September 2008, housed in a new purpose-built building on the site of MacMillan Halls of Residence which were demolished in 2007. A second phase of building replaced the Westbrook and Randall Well buildings with a more modern structure. Government funding was put on hold for this project in March 2009 and was not expected to be available again until 2011. The new building, named the David Hockney Building after one its most famous alumni, opened in September 2014 after two years of construction. A new Advanced Technology Centre was scheduled to open in September 2015 on a nearby former car park.

The College received the go-ahead by the Skills Funding Agency for a £50 million building. The project is the second phase of the College&#x27;s Accommodation Strategy started with the opening of the Trinity Green Campus:

Bradford College&#x27;s Appleton Building was named after the Bradford scientist Edward Victor Appleton, and the College&#x27;s Lister Building was named after Samuel Lister.

==Quality assurance==
As an institution in receipt of government funding Bradford College is regularly inspected by Ofsted and the QAA. The last reports from 2008 (Ofsted) and 2010 (QAA) confirmed the high quality of the provision and identified a number of good practices across the institution.

Ofsted inspection in 2017 gave the college a &#x27;Requires Improvement&#x27; grading in most areas. The Initial Teacher Education inspected by Ofsted in 2010 also resulted in good and outstanding grades.

The latest Ofsted inspection was done on 9 November 2021 and found that the College was Good.

==Campuses==
The main campus is situated on Great Horton Road close to Bradford city centre. However, some courses are delivered elsewhere. The Academy is located in the Three Valleys Centre in Keighley. There are several other campuses in Bradford, such as Bolton Royd on Manningham Lane or Appleton Academy in Wyke. Part-time leisure, community and some of the ESOL courses are offered in over 20 different locations across Bradford.

==Bradford College Education Trust==
Bradford College is the sponsor of three secondary schools as part of the Bradford College Education Trust. the three schools are Appleton Academy, Bradford Studio School and Samuel Lister Academy.

==Erasmus participation==
Bradford College participates in the Erasmus Programme. The College is in agreement with 26 institutions across 14 European countries:

==Trivia==
Bradford College&#x27;s Trinity Green Campus is also home to the &quot;Dragons Den&quot; where EBL division 2 basketball Team Bradford Dragons play their home matches on Saturday evenings.

Bradford College students broke the record for the biggest onion bhaji in 2011 and the biggest samosa in 2012.

The management of the College caused a stir when a journalist found out it had ordered a mace worth £22,000 to enhance the students&#x27; experience during the graduation ceremony in December 2011.

Bradford College Students&#x27; Union was awarded the Further Education Students&#x27; Union of the Year title at the NUS 2013 Awards Ceremony.

<text>Clean is a 2004 drama film directed by French director Olivier Assayas, starring Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte. It was jointly funded by Canada, France, and United Kingdom sources. It was released in the United States in 2006.

==Plot==
Emily Wang (Maggie Cheung), a former video jockey, who has been in a tempestuous relationship for several years with Lee Hauser (played by James Johnston of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), a rock musician. Lee&#x27;s friends feel that Emily is bad for him, describing her as a junkie. Their young son, Jay, is living in Vancouver with Lee&#x27;s parents.

As the film opens, the pair have arrived in Hamilton, Canada, to see Metric perform. Following an argument in their motel room, Emily walks out and, after taking heroin, falls asleep in her car. When she returns the following morning, she finds that Lee has died of a drug overdose, and the Ontario Provincial Police are investigating. As Emily attempts to force her way into the room, the police find heroin in her bag and she is arrested.

Emily spends six months in jail and, upon release, discovers that custody of her son has been awarded to Lee&#x27;s parents. She resolves to return to Paris, where she used to live. Before leaving, she briefly meets Albrecht, Lee&#x27;s father (played by Nick Nolte), who tells her that he would prefer that she not see Jay for a few years.

In Paris, Emily begins work in a Chinese restaurant owned by relatives but does not enjoy it. She has become addicted to methadone and relies on her friends for prescriptions. Meanwhile, Lee&#x27;s mother, Rosemary (played by Martha Henry) falls ill and she and Albrecht travel to London with Jay for medical treatment. While they are there, Albrecht decides to take Jay to meet Emily, but the boy has been told by his grandmother that Emily was responsible for his father&#x27;s death and does not want to see her.

Emily eventually decides that she must get clean in order to be able to spend time with her son. She stops taking methadone and prepares for Jay&#x27;s arrival. When the boy eventually meets her, she takes him to a zoo and explains her relationship with his father and why they took drugs. Emily also has become a singer; when she is given the opportunity arising from meeting a fellow musician in prison, she must make some serious decisions about her life.
