<text>Kazimierz Dolny () is a small historic town in eastern Poland, on the right (eastern) bank of the Vistula river, 50 km from Lublin, in Puławy County, Lublin Voivodeship. Historically it belongs to Lesser Poland, and in the past it was one of the most important cities of the province.

Now a tourist destination, the town enjoyed its greatest prosperity in the 16th and the first half of the 17th century, due to the trade in grain conducted along the Vistula. It became an economic backwater after that trade declined, and this freeze in economic development enabled the town to preserve its Renaissance urban plan and appearance. Since the 19th century it has become a holiday destination, attracting artists and summer residents.

Kazimierz Dolny is an art center in Poland. Many painters retreat to this small town to paint and sell their work. Galleries can be found in almost every street, offering for sale sculptures, stained-glass, folk art, and fine art.

The town is one of Poland&#x27;s official national Historic Monuments (&quot;Pomnik historii&quot;), as designated September 16, 1994 and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.

== Location ==
Kazimierz Dolny is located on the eastern bank of the Vistula (Wisła), at the edge of historical Lublin Upland extending further east from Małopolska Upland to the west. It owes its picturesque location to the Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula. The town is part of the so-called &quot;tourist triangle&quot;: Puławy – Kazimierz Dolny – Nałęczów. It does not have a rail connection, the nearest station is located in Puławy (Puławy - Miasto).

== History ==
The history of Kazimierz Dolny dates back to the 11th century, when on one of the local hills there was a Benedictine settlement called Wietrzna Gora. In 1181, Prince Casimir II the Just handed the settlement to Norbertine nuns from Kraków’s district of Zwierzyniec. The nuns changed its name to Kazimierz, in honor of the prince. For the first time, the name Kazimierz appears in chronicles in 1249. Later on, the adjective Dolny (Lower) was added, to distinguish the town from the Jewish town Kazimierz - now a district of Kraków. In the early 14th century, the village became a royal possession, and King Władysław I the Elbow-high founded there a parish church in 1325.

The foundation of the town is attributed to Władysław&#x27;s son, King Casimir III the Great, who granted the town rights in the first half of the 14th century. Later, King Władysław II Jagiełło modernized Kazimierz Dolny, creating a modern town, with a market square and streets. At that time, the decision was taken not to build any houses on the northern side of the market square, so as not to obstruct the view of the church and the castle.

In 1501, Kazimierz Dolny became the home of a starosta, and the town was passed over to the noble Firlej family, remaining in its hands until 1644. The Firlejs twice rebuilt the town and the castle, after the fires of 1561 and 1585. They cared about privileged status of Kazimierz Dolny, as a merchant town, located along the busy waterway of the Vistula. In 1628, Franciscan friars settled in Kazimierz, building a monastery and expanding the church.

The town&#x27;s golden age ended in February 1656 (see Deluge), when Swedish troops under King Charles X Gustav burned and ransacked it. The number of inhabitants declined, and King John III Sobieski tried to improve the situation, by allowing in 1677 Armenian, Greek and Jewish merchants to settle there. Meanwhile, the profitable Vistula river trade came to an end, as there was no demand for Polish grains in Western Europe. In the late 18th century, as a result of the Partitions of Poland, Kazimierz Dolny was cut from the port of Gdańsk and turned into a town of minor importance.

From the late 19th century, more affluent residents of Lublin and Warsaw started to build properties in the area. Spas and villas were constructed, and in 1927, already in the Second Polish Republic, Kazimierz Dolny once again became a town. Partly destroyed in World War II, it was rebuilt, and on September 8, 1994, its center was officially recognized as a historical monument.

In 2024, Kazimierz Dolny was placed by Travel + Leisure magazine on the list of Europe&#x27;s 22 most beautiful small towns and villages.

===Jewish history===

A small Jewish community was present in the city from the time of Casimir III the Great in the 14th century. The king granted the Jews a writ of rights which caused the town to become a focal point for Jewish immigration. When John III Sobieski became King in 1674, he granted the Jews of Poland a respite from taxes. Sobieski also reconfirmed for the Jews all the rights they had been granted by previous kings. During his reign, the housing restrictions were abolished and the Jewish community began to flourish again.

In the 19th century, Yehezkel Taub, a disciple of the &quot;Seer of Lublin&quot;, founded the Hasidic dynasty of Kuzmir in the town.

Between the First and Second World Wars, the Jewish population was about 1,400, half the total population of the town. The town&#x27;s picturesque surroundings were chosen to film scenes for the shtetl-based 1937 Yiddish film &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. It was also a location for the similar 1936 film &quot;Yiddle With His Fiddle.&quot;

The Germans invaded Kazimierz Dolny in September 1939. The population at that time included about 1800 Jews, slightly less than 40 percent of the population. During the occupation, a Judenrat (Jewish Council) was established in the town which was forced to oversee the German requirements of forced labor of the town&#x27;s Jews. This included road reconstruction, rock quarrying, and menial tasks serving the Nazis. They were forced to pave roads using tombstones from the local Jewish cemetery. In 1940, the Germans established a ghetto, bringing all the Jews from the surrounding Puławy County to live in the ghetto. In 1942, those Jews who had survived hunger, disease and slave labor were taken to Belzec where they were gassed on arrival. At the end of 1942, the town was officially declared &quot;free of Jews&quot;. Fewer than twenty of Kazimierz Dolny&#x27;s Jewish inhabitants are thought to have survived the war. After the Holocaust, a memorial wall was erected using tombstones from the Jewish cemetery that survived.

One of the most famous Jewish residents of the town was the painter and sculptor Chaim Goldberg. Another Jewish scion of the city was Polish-American journalist Samuel Leib Shneiderman.

In 2013, the Pardes Festival, which celebrates Jewish culture, was inaugurated in Kazimierz Dolny.

<doc id="1042960" wikidata="Q677401" url="?curid=1042960" title="Venice Preserv'd">
<text>Venice Preserv&#x27;d is an English Restoration play written by Thomas Otway, and the most significant tragedy of the English stage in the 1680s. It was first staged in 1682, with Thomas Betterton as Jaffeir and Elizabeth Barry as Belvidera. The play was soon printed and enjoyed many revivals through to the 1830s. In 2019, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a modern adaptation, &quot;Venice Preserved&quot;, at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

==Plot==

Jaffeir, a noble but impoverished Venetian, has secretly married Belvidera, the daughter of a proud senator named Priuli, who has cut off her inheritance. Jaffeir&#x27;s friend Pierre, a foreign soldier, stokes Jaffeir&#x27;s resentment and entices him into a plot against the Senate of Venice. Pierre&#x27;s own reasons for plotting against the Senate revolve around another senator (the corrupt, foolish Antonio) paying for relations with Pierre&#x27;s mistress, Aquilina. Despite Pierre&#x27;s complaints, the Senate does nothing about it, explaining that Antonio has senatorial privilege.

Pierre introduces Jaffeir to the conspirators, led by bloodthirsty Renault. To get their trust, Jaffeir must put Belvidera in Renault&#x27;s care as a hostage. That night, Renault attempts to rape Belvidera, but she escapes to Jaffeir. Jaffeir then tells Belvidera about the plot against the Senate. She devises a plan of her own: Jaffeir will reveal the conspiracy to the Senate and claim the lives of the conspirators as his reward. (Jaffeir would then choose to pardon some or all of the conspirators, notably his friend Pierre.)

Jaffeir follows Belvidera&#x27;s plan, but when the Senate gives the conspirators the choice between confession (and the possibility of pardon) and death, they choose to die rather than sacrifice their pride. In remorse for betraying Pierre and losing his honor, Jaffeir threatens to kill Belvidera, unless she can obtain a pardon for the conspirators. She does so, but the pardon arrives too late. Jaffeir visits Pierre before his execution. Pierre is crestfallen because he is sentenced to die a dishonourable death by hanging, not the death of a soldier. He forgives Jaffeir and whispers to him (unheard by the audience) to kill him honourably before he is executed. Just as Pierre is about to be hanged, Jaffeir rushes up to the gallows and stabs him; as a form of atonement, he then commits suicide. Belvidera then goes insane and dies.

==Main characters==
===Antonio===
Antonio is a corrupt senator who is sexually involved with the courtesan Aquilina: in the prologue of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;, Otway describes Antonio as “a Senator that keeps a whore/ In Venice none of a higher office bore. / To lewdness every night the lecher ran;/ Show me, all London, such another man, /”. Otway&#x27;s invitation to find a “such another man” has allowed several critics to connect Senator Antonio with Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who was a Whig politician.

Antonio&#x27;s key scene in &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; is the &quot;Nicky Nacky&quot; scene where Antonio attempts foreplay with Aquilina by pretending to be a bull, a toad, and a dog. According to Derek H. Hughes, Antonio&#x27;s relationship with Aquilina mirrors other relationships in the play by portraying prostitution, submission, and self-abasement, which can be subtly seen in the relationships between Renault and Belvidera, Jaffeir and Pierre, and Jaffeir and Belvidera.

===Aquilina===
Aquilina is a courtesan who is romantically involved with Pierre and sexually involved with the senator Antonio. Aquilina allows Pierre to meet with the conspirators in her home (II.i.48.) Aquilina appears in the play three times: Act II, Act III, and Act V (8). When the Lyric Theatre performed &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; in 1920, Edith Evans performed as a successful Aquilina. Aquilina was played by Stephanie Beacham at the Lyttelton Theatre in 1984.

===Belvidera===
Belvidera is a noblewoman who is the daughter of Priuli and the wife of Jaffeir. “Belvidera is affectionate, constant, and pure” character who remains faithful to Jaffeir and gains pardon for the conspirators who were plotting to murder her father (1). According to Derek Hughes, Belvidera is a complex character; sometimes Belvidera is an admirable character, particularly in comparison to those who surround her. When Jaffeir tells Belvidera of the plot to destroy the senate, she recognises the corruption of the senate, but does not condone the plan of the conspirators (4): she says to Jaffeir, “Can thy great heart descend so vilely low, / Mix with hired slaves, bravoes, and common/ stabbers,… and take a ruffian&#x27;s wages/ To cut the throats of wretches as they sleep?” (8). Her argument persuades Jaffeir to not partake in the conspirators’ plan, but to instead turn them in to the senate.

On the other hand, Derek Hughes also says, “Belvidera is not different in kind from the other characters. She is the highest product of the world of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;, but she is of that world to the very end” (4). Belvidera is also resourceful and cunning when it comes to getting what she wants. Belvidera persuades Jaffeir to discontinue his association with the conspirators by telling him of Renault&#x27;s assault towards her (III. ii. 181.) Belvidera calls upon the memories of her dead mother to convince her father to pardon the conspirators (Otway V. i. 44.)

&quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;’s first performance was at the Duke&#x27;s Theatre on 9 February 1682, with Elizabeth Barry as Belvidera. In 1782 at the Drury Lane Theatre, Sarah Siddons played the role of Belvidera; two years later, Siddons was Belvidera at the Covenant Garden (5). The Lyric Theatre in London filled the role of Belvidera with Cathleen Nesbitt in 1920. Barbara Leigh-Hunt played Belvidera in 1970 at Prospect Productions’ production of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;. Jane Lapotaire was Belvidera in Lyttelton Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; in 1984. In 2019, Jodie McNee played Belvidera at the RSC.

===Jaffeir===
Jaffeir is the husband of Belvidera, the son-in-law of Priuli, and the friend of Pierre.

Jaffeir is the tragic hero in &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;: he is expected to fulfill the roles of husband, friend, and activist. According to Michael DePorte, “Most readers seldom, if ever, admire Jaffeir for anything, they can sympathize with him only as a man torn on the horns of a terrible dilemma;” that dilemma being his divided loyalties between Belvidera and Pierre (1). Because of his friendship with Pierre, Jaffeir gives his loyalty to Pierre and the conspirators, but because of his love for Belvidera he betrays Pierre and the conspirators.

According to Bywaters, Jaffeir can be easily compared with the Popish betrayer Titus Oates due to the proximity of the Popish Plot with the production of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;, as well as the Catholic terminology that Pierre uses in reference to Jaffeir (2). The religious tones in &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; allows Bettie Proffitt, in her article concerning religious symbolism in &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;, to compare Jaffeir with Adam.

For the opening showing of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; on 9 February 1682 at the Duke&#x27;s Theatre, William Smith played the character of Jaffeir. In 1782 John Kemble was Jaffeir. In London in 1953, John Gielgud filled the role of Jaffeir. Alan Bates was Jaffeir in 1969 at The Bristol Old Vic&#x27;s production of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;. More recently, John Castle was Jaffeir in 1970 during the Prospects Productions’ of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot;. (6) in 1984 Michael Pennington was Jaffeir (6). In 2019, Michael Grady-Hall played Jaffeir at the RSC.

===Pierre===
Pierre is the friend of Jaffeir, the lover of Aquilina, and a conspirator against the senate, as well as a soldier for Venice.

Pierre discovers that while he has been away (presumably at war) Senator Antonio has been sexually involved with his mistress Aquilina. Pierre brings this matter before the senate hoping for justice, but the senate excuses Antonio&#x27;s behaviour as a privilege entitled to the senators (I. i. 206–217). This situation is what causes Pierre to become involved with the conspiracy against the State.

Pierre is the primary voice for the conspirators and delivers many eloquent speeches throughout the play. Pierre has little difficulty in recruiting Jaffeir to the plot against the senate because of his ability to transform Jaffeir&#x27;s need for revenge against Priuli into a need for revenge against the corrupt senate (3)

Even though Pierre manipulates Jaffeir, Pierre is a loyal and devoted friend to Jaffeir (1). When Pierre presents Jaffeir to the conspirators, he says, “I’ve brought my All into the publick Stock, / I had but one Friend, and him I’ll share amongst you!” (II. 310–11) Not only faithful to Jaffeir, Pierre is also faithful to his cause with the conspirators until the very end.

Because of Pierre&#x27;s political jargon, several of his speeches have been censored over the years. Bywaters believes that &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; is an attack on the Whig party and that Pierre&#x27;s speeches are the primary vehicle for those attacks: “and Pierre’s accusation of a ‘new Tyranny’... turns the Whigs’ rhetoric of tyranny and arbitrary power against them.&quot; Pierre’s charismatic speeches encourage such a passionate response from the audience that &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, “the audience seemed enraptured with every development of rebel villainy.&quot; After an assassination attempt on George III, the performance of &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; that evening nearly caused a riot which caused the further performances to be cancelled. &quot;Venice Preserv’d&quot; was not seen in London for seven years until it returned in 1802; however, Pierre&#x27;s part was censored and lacking its idealism.

At the Duke&#x27;s Theatre in 1682, Pierre was performed by Thomas Betterton. In 1802 George Frederick Cooke played the role of Pierre. In London in 1920 at the Lyric Theatre, Baliol Holloway was Pierre. In 1953, Pierre was played by Paul Scofield. In the Prospect Production in 1970, Julian Glover was Pierre. (6) in 1984, Ian McKellen played Pierre at the Lyttelton Theatre. In 2019, Stephen Fewell played Pierre at the RSC.

===Priuli===
Priuli is the father of Belvidera and a senator of Venice. According to DePort, Priuli is a complex character because of the mixed signals he gives concerning Belvidera (1). Priuli calls Belvidera his “age&#x27;s darling” who is “all that his heart holds dear,” but according to Jaffeir, Priuli protects himself before taking care of Belvidera: “Your unskilled pilot/ Dashed us upon a rock, when to your boat/ You made for safety, entered first yourself” (I. i. 36.). Priuli disowns his only child when she chooses and marries a man without her father&#x27;s permission (8). In 1984, Brewster Mason played Priuli at the Lyttelton Theatre.

==Context==
The play contains a fair number of political parallels. The character of Senator Antonio is a reference to Shaftesbury, and the grand plot resembles the Gunpowder Plot, among others, most notably the so-called &quot;Spanish Conspiracy&quot; against Venice of 1618. The oceanic city of Venice had been used as a stand-in for London before, but the subtext most noticeable to contemporaries was the parallel with the Exclusion Crisis (see, for example, Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;). Therefore, one reason for the play&#x27;s outstanding initial success was its political allusiveness.

&quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; also has several feminist issues. As the play was written in the Restoration period, when the legal protections for women were few, the emotional heart of the play is the vulnerability of women. Aquillina, the play&#x27;s courtesan, is shown very little regard by the men in the play. Her lover, Pierre, refuses to reveal the plot against the Senate to her, suggesting that women shouldn&#x27;t talk out of bed, and Antonio never calls her by her name, but refers to her only as his &quot;little Nacky&quot; (a slang term for a woman&#x27;s genitalia). Belvidera is reduced to collateral when she is left in the hands of men her husband barely knows. Jaffeir&#x27;s honour takes precedence over Belvidera, and the tension over love and honour is the male characters&#x27; crisis. At the end of the play, Jaffeir chooses his devotion to his friend over his devotion to his wife, and the two men die honourably, whereas Belvidera is left to die an inglorious death resulting from her madness. Contemporary theatre-goers were sensitive to the tragic tension between the public and private obligations of the characters.

&quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; was one of the first of the she-tragedy plays. Contemporary audiences responded to the pathos of the character of Belvidera, which was written for the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry and capitalised on Barry&#x27;s phenomenal success in the role of the similarly helpless Monimia in Otway&#x27;s &quot;The Orphan&quot; (1680). Of all of the characters, Belvidera is the most powerless in the face of overwhelming social and political turmoil. Each of the characters has a conflict between the social and personal laws of class and self. Belvidera has to struggle against duty to her father and to love. Jaffeir has to struggle against &quot;honour&quot; and love, as well as friendship and ideals. Priuli must decide between love of daughter and personal pride. Belvidera remained a starring role for actresses because her tragic situation was most affecting for audiences.

==Success of the play==
Otway was the toast of London after &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d,&quot; and yet the financial situation of the theatre meant that he did not grow wealthy from his work. In 1692, Robert Gould (&quot;To Julian, Secretary of the Muses&quot;) wrote, &quot;Otway, though very fat, starves.&quot; While&quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; has not survived to the twenty-first century as a byword for tragedy, it was one of the best-known and most important of English tragedies for over 100 years.

On 10 April 1865, John Wilkes Booth told Louis J. Weichmann that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;. Although Weichmann did not understand the reference at the time, it was later assumed to be a veiled allusion to the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.

<doc id="1042963" wikidata="Q465213" url="?curid=1042963" title="Jarosław Dąbrowski">
<text>Jarosław Żądło-Dąbrowski (; 13 November 1836 – 23 May 1871), also known as Jaroslav Dombrowski, was a Polish nobleman (szlachta member) and military officer in the Imperial Russian Army, a Polish nationalist and radical republican for Poland, and general and military commander of the Paris Commune in its later period. He was a participant in the Polish 1863 January Uprising and one of the leaders of the &quot;Red&quot; faction among the insurrectionists as a member of the Central National Committee and the Polish Provisional National Government.

== Early life ==
Dąbrowski was born in 1836, after the Partitions of Poland, in Żytomierz, in the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire, in what is now Zhytomyr in Ukraine. He was the offspring of the old szlachta family Żądło-Dąbrowski z Dąbrówki. He bore the Radwan coat of arms. His father was Wiktor Żądło-Dąbrowski, his mother was Zofia &quot;née&quot; Falkenhagen-Zaleska.

== Military career ==
In 1845 at age 9, Dąbrowski joined the Imperial Russian Army, enrolling in the officer training corps at the Brest-Litovsk Fortress, where he spent 8 years. He graduated from the St. Petersburg Cadet Corps in 1855. He fought as a Russian officer against uprisings of the local mountain populations in the Caucasian War. In 1859 he enrolled in the General Staff Academy in St. Petersburg. There he was one of the leaders of the secret &quot;Officers&#x27; Committee of the First Army&quot;. Members included several hundred Russian and Polish officers, cooperating with the revolutionary &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; (Land and Liberty) movement. He became involved in the preparation of the January Uprising, but was arrested on 14 August 1862, and exiled to Siberia for his participation in a plot against the Tsar, Alexander II. In 1865, he escaped and fled to France.

== In Paris ==


In early March 1871, following months of siege by the Prussians and the capture of Napoleon III by the Prussian Army, a socialist-anarchist coalition called the Paris Commune seized power in Paris and declared itself independent of the French government. Dąbrowski was elected to the Council of the Paris Commune, using the spelling Jaroslav Dombrowski. As one of the few Commune soldiers with military experience, he was soon named Commander-in-Chief of the Commune forces.

On 21 May 1871, shortly after he was named commander, the French Army attacked and entered Paris. The first reaction of many of the National Guard was to find someone to blame, and Dąbrowski was the first to be accused. Rumors circulated he accepted a million francs to give up the city. He was deeply offended by the rumors. They stopped when he died two days later from wounds received on the barricades. His last reported words were, &quot;Do they still say I was a traitor?&quot; The Commune fell on 28 May 1871.

=== Misidentification with pianist Henri Dombrowski ===
A photographic portrait, taken before 1870, of Paris pianist Henri Dombrowski was falsely portrayed as depicting General Jarosław Dąbrowski by photographer Pierre Petit. Petit sold 200,000 copies of the photo. Henri Dombrowski demanded damages. The misidentification with pianist Henri Dombrowski can be seen in many monuments and portrayals of Jarosław Dąbrowski as a result of Petit&#x27;s actions.

== Legacy ==
Several schools and roads are named after him in Poland; among them most notable is the Military University of Technology in Warsaw. In the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the Dabrowski Battalion and various brigade-strength units (known in Polish as the &quot;Dąbrowszczacy&quot;) – were named in his honour. During the communist era Polish banknotes featured Dąbrowski on the 200 zl bill.

<doc id="1042977" wikidata="Q78731" url="?curid=1042977" title="Otto F. Kernberg">
<text>Otto Friedmann Kernberg (born 10 September 1928) is an Austrian-born American psychoanalyst and professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine. He is most widely known for his psychoanalytic theories on borderline personality organization and narcissistic pathology. In addition, his work has been central in integrating postwar ego psychology (which was primarily developed in the United States and the United Kingdom) with Kleinian and other object relations perspectives (which was developed primarily in the United Kingdom and South America). His integrative writings were central to the development of modern object relations, a school within modern psychoanalysis.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna to Jewish parents, Leo Kernberg, and Sonia Paula Friedmann Kernberg, Kernberg was an only child. Kernberg and his family fled Nazi Germany in 1939, emigrating to Chile. He studied biology and medicine at the University of Chile, and afterwards psychiatry and psychoanalysis with the Chilean Psychoanalytic Society. He first came to the U.S. in 1959 on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study research in psychotherapy with Jerome Frank at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1961 he emigrated to the U.S. joining the C.F. Menninger Memorial Hospital, later became director of the hospital until 1965. He was the Supervising and Training Analyst of the Topeka Institute for Psychoanalysis, and Director of the Psychotherapy Research Project of Menninger Foundation. During this time, the insight of his colleague Herman van der Waals contributed in raising Kernberg&#x27;s awareness and interest in narcissistic personalities.

In 1973 he moved to New York where he was Director of the General Clinical Service of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and Training and Supervising Analyst at the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. In 1976 he was appointed as Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell University and Director of the Institute for Personality Disorders Institute of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was President of the International Psychoanalytical Association from 1997 to 2001. He was married to Paulina Kernberg, a child psychiatrist and also a Cornell professor, until her death in 2006.

His principal contributions have been in the fields of narcissism, object relations theory and personality disorders. He developed a novel and useful framework for coordinating personality disorders along dimensions of structural organization and severity.
He was awarded the 1972 Heinz Hartmann Award of the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, the 1975 Edward A. Strecker Award from the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, the 1981 George E. Daniels Merit Award of the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine.

== Transference-focused psychotherapy ==

Otto Kernberg designed an intensive form of psychoanalytic psychotherapy known as Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP), which is intended to be suitable for Borderline Personality Organization (BPO) patients. BPO patients are described as experiencing so-called &#x27;splits&#x27; in their affect and thinking, and the intended aim of the treatment is focused on the integration of split off parts of self and object representations.

TFP entails two to three 45 or 50-minute sessions per week. It views the individual as holding unreconciled and contradictory internalized representations of self and significant others that are affectively charged. The defense against these contradictory internalized object relations is called identity diffusion, and leads to disturbed relationships with others and with self. The distorted perceptions of self, others, and associated affects are the focus of treatment as they emerge in the relationship with the therapist (transference). The consistent interpretation of these distorted perceptions is considered the mechanism of change.

===Suitable patients===

Kernberg designed TFP especially for patients with BPO. In his model, these patients suffer from identity diffusion, primitive defense operations and unstable reality testing.

Identity diffusion results from pathological object relations and involves contradictory character traits, discontinuity of self and either very idealized or devalued object relations. Defense operations often applied by BPO patients are splitting, denial, projective identification, primitive devaluation / idealization and omnipotence. Reality testing is negatively influenced by the primitive defense mechanisms as they change a person&#x27;s perception of self and others.

===Goals of TFP===
The major goals of TFP are better behavioral control, increased affect regulation, more intimate and gratifying relationships and the ability to pursue life goals. This is believed to be accomplished through the development of integrated representations of self and others, the modification of primitive defensive operations and the resolution of identity diffusion that perpetuate the fragmentation of the patient&#x27;s internal representational world. To do this, the client&#x27;s affectively charged internal representations of previous relationships are consistently interpreted as the therapist becomes aware of them in the therapeutic relationship, that is, the transference. Techniques of clarification, confrontation, and interpretation are used within the evolving transference relationship between the patient and the therapist.

===Treatment procedure===

====Contract====

The treatment begins with the development of the treatment contract, which consists of general guidelines that apply for all clients and of specific items developed from problem areas of the individual client that could interfere with the therapy progress. The contract also contains therapist responsibilities. The client and the therapist must agree to the content of the treatment contract before the therapy can proceed.

====Therapeutic process====

TFP consists of the following three-steps: 
*(a) the diagnostic description of a particular internalized object relation in the transference
*(b) the diagnostic elaboration of the corresponding self and object representation in the transference, and of their enactment in the transference /countertransference and
*(c) the integration of the split-off self representations, leading to an integrated sense of self and others which resolves identity diffusion.

During the first year of treatment, TFP focuses on a hierarchy of issues: 
*the containment of suicidal and self-destructive behaviors
*the various ways of destroying the treatments
*the identification and recapitulation of dominant object relational patterns (from unintegrated and undifferentiated affects and representations of self and others to a more coherent whole).

===Mechanisms of change===

In TFP, hypothesized mechanisms of change derive from Kernberg&#x27;s developmentally based theory of Borderline Personality Organisation, conceptualized in terms of unintegrated and undifferentiated affects and representations of self and other. Partial representations of self and other are paired and linked by an affect in mental units called object relation dyads. These dyads are elements of psychological structure. In borderline pathology, the lack of integration of the internal object relations dyads corresponds to a &#x27;split&#x27; psychological structure in which totally negative representations are split off/segregated from idealized positive representations of self and other (seeing people as all good or all bad). The putative global mechanism of change in patients treated with TFP is the integration of these polarized affect states and representations of self and other into a more coherent whole.

== Theory on narcissism and the controversy with H. Kohut ==

Otto Kernberg states that there are three types of narcissism: normal adult narcissism, normal infantile narcissism, and pathological narcissism. Pathological narcissism, defined as the libidinal investment in a pathological structure of the self, is further divided into three types (regression to the regulation of the infantile self-esteem, narcissistic choice of object, narcissistic personality disorder) with narcissistic personality disorder being the most severe of all. Still, narcissism has been a great source of disagreement between Otto Kernberg and Heinz Kohut. Although both focused on narcissistic, borderline, and psychotic patients, the focus and content of their theory and treatment has been considerably differentiated. Their major diversities emerged in response to their conceptualizations regarding the relationship between Narcissistic and Borderline personalities, normal vs. pathological narcissism, their ideas about narcissistic idealization and the grandiose self, as well as the psychoanalytic technique and the narcissistic transference.

== Theory on narcissism ==

According to Kernberg, the self is an intrapsychic structure consisting of multiple self representations. It is a realistic self which integrates both good and bad self-images. That is, the self constitutes a structure that combines libidinally and aggressively invested components. Kernberg defines normal narcissism as the libidinal investment of the self. However, it needs to be emphasized that this libidinal investment of the self is not merely derived from an instinctual source of libidinal energy. On the contrary, it stems from the several relationships between the self and other intrapsychic structures, such as the ego the superego and the id.

===Types of narcissism===

====Normal adult narcissism====
This is a normal self-esteem based on normal structures of the self. The individual has introjected whole representations of objects, has stable objects relationships and a solid moral system. The superego is fully developed and individualized.

====Normal infantile narcissism====
Regulation of self-esteem occurs through gratifications related to the age, which include or imply a normal infantile system of values, demands or prohibitions.

====Pathological narcissism====
;Three subtypes

* Regression to the regulation of infantile self-esteem: the ideal ego is dominated by infantile pursuits, values and prohibitions. The regulation of self-esteem is overly dependent on expressions or defences against infantile pleasures, which are discarded in adult life. This is the mildest type of narcissistic pathology.
* Narcissistic choice of object: this type is more severe than the first one but more rare. The representation of the infantile self is projected on an object and then identified through that same object. Thus, a libidinal association is generated, where the functions of the self and the object have been exchanged.
* Narcissistic personality disorder: this type is different from both normal adult narcissism and from regression to normal infantile narcissism. It is the most severe type and is suitable for psychoanalysis.

In Kernberg&#x27;s view, narcissistic personalities are differentiated from both normal adult narcissism and from fixation at or regression to normal infantile narcissism. Fixation at a primitive stage of development or lack of development of specific intrapsychic structures is not adequate to explain the characteristics of narcissistic personalities. Those characteristics (through a process of pathological differentiation and integration of ego and superego structures) are the consequence of pathological object relationships. Pathological narcissism is not merely the libidinal investment in the self but in a pathological, underdeveloped structure of the self. This pathological structure presents defences against early self and object images, which are either libidinally or aggressively invested. The psychoanalytic process brings to the surface primitive object relations, conflicts and defences, which are typical of the developmental stages that precede the stability of the object.

== Kernberg vs. Kohut ==

Otto Kernberg and Heinz Kohut can be considered to be two theorists that have markedly influenced past and current psychoanalytic thinking. Both focused on the observation and treatment of patients who were otherwise thought to be unsuitable for analytic therapy. Their main work has been mostly related to individuals with narcissistic, borderline, and psychotic psychopathology. Still, their perspectives concerning the causes, psychic organization, and treatment of these disorders have been considerably different. Taken as a whole, Kohut is regarded as a self theorist who radically departed from Sigmund Freud&#x27;s conjectural conceptualizations, focusing mostly on people&#x27;s need for self-organization and self-expression. Kernberg in contrast, remained faithful to the Freudian metapsychology, concentrating more on people&#x27;s struggle between love and aggression. Their main differences are summarized below.

===Relationship between narcissistic personality and borderline personality===

One of the main disagreements between the two theorists revolves around their conceptualization among narcissistic and borderline disorders. According to Kernberg, the defensive structure of the narcissistic individual is quite similar to that of the borderline person since the former has a fairly underlying borderline personality organization which becomes obvious when one looks at the defenses of splitting and projective identification. He identifies constitutional along with environmental factors as the source of disturbance for these individuals by stressing the important role of the mother surrogate who treats the child on the surface (callously) with little regard for his/her feelings and needs. Kohut on the other hand, sees borderline personality as totally distinct from the narcissistic one and less able to benefit from the analytic treatment. Equally, a narcissistic personality is more apt for analysis since it is characterized by a more resilient self. According to Kohut, the environment alone is the major cause of troubles for these persons. Moreover, although both focus on the concept of the &quot;grandiose self&quot; in their narcissistic personality theorizing, they provide different explanations for it. For Kohut, &quot;grandiose self&quot; reflects the &quot;fixation of an archaic &#x27;normal&#x27; primitive self&quot; while for Kernberg it is a pathological development, different from normal narcissism. For Kohut treatment should be primarily centered on encouraging the patient&#x27;s narcissistic desires, wishes, and needs to open up during the process of transference. For Kernberg, the goal of treatment should be to use confrontation strategies so as to help the patient integrate his/her internal fragmented world.

===Normal vs. pathological narcissism===

One of the main arguments between Kohut and Kernberg is about normal and pathological narcissism. As mentioned earlier, Kohut assumes that a narcissistic personality suffers from developmental arrest. Specifically, he assumes that this type of personality mirrors adaptive narcissistic wishes, needs, and objectives that, nevertheless, have not been satisfied during childhood development by the parental environment. Here, the grandiose self is nothing more than an archaic form that prospectively ought to become the normal self. When this does not occur then pathological narcissism emerges. In his explanation of pathological narcissism, he pays attention on the libidinal forces or charges in order to provide an etiology of how this disorder develops. For him the aggression drive is of secondary importance in respect to the libidinal drive and that is why one should differentiate between ordinary aggression and narcissistic rage. The first, according to him, is adaptive for eradicating obstructions when heading toward a realistic goal whereas the second is the forceful response to narcissistic injury. Kernberg however, sees Kohut&#x27;s ideas as de-emphasizing the power of aggression. He allies more to the Freudian conceptualization, by proposing that narcissistic behavior results from pathological development in which aggressive drives play a central role. He argues that narcissism on the whole involves a strong aggressive drive that cannot possibly be analyzed separately from the libidinal one. As he says, &quot;one cannot study the vicissitudes of normal and pathological narcissism without relating the development of the respective internalized object relations to both libidinal and aggressive drive alternatives.&quot;

===Relationship between narcissistic idealization and grandiose self===

Kohut departed from the classical Freudian view, which suggested that some patients could not be analyzed given that they lacked the ability to develop transferences. He postulated that narcissistic patients are capable of presenting transferences but these are somewhat different from those of other patients, such as the neurotics. He distinguished three types, namely the idealizing, the mirror, or the twinship transference. His debate with Kernberg concerns mostly the idealizing transference, which, according to Kohut, relates to a fixation at an archaic level of normal development. Still Kernberg believed that the idealizing transference is nothing more than a pathological type of idealization that is produced as a response to the substantial instigation of the grandiose self in the transference.

=== Psychoanalytic technique and narcissistic transference ===

Otto F. Kernberg and Heinz Kohut regard the analytic process as well as the role of the analyst in quite different terms.

==== The analytical situation concerning pathological narcissism according to Otto F. Kernberg ====

Kernberg requests a methodological and persistent interpretation of the defensive function of grandiosity and idealization as they emerge in transference. The role of the analyst should be neutral rather than supportive, especially during the confrontation process, in order to modify the narcissist&#x27;s pathological structure. &quot;The analyst must be continuously focusing on the particular quality of the transference in these cases and consistently counteract the patient&#x27;s efforts toward omnipotent control and devaluation&quot;. This traditional emphasis on aggressive interpretation of narcissistic phenomena derives from and is wholly consistent with Freud&#x27;s early view of narcissistic neuroses as unanalysable and narcissistic defenses as generating the most recalcitrant resistances to the analytic process.

====The analytical situation concerning pathological narcissism according to Heinz Kohut====
In contrast to seeing primitive grandiosity or idealization as a representation of a defensive retreat from reality, Heinz Kohut regards narcissistic illusions within the analytic situation as representations of the patient&#x27;s attempt to establish crucial developmental opportunities. These narcissistic illusions thus give an opportunity for revitalization of the self. Therefore, Heinz Kohut advocates that the analyst&#x27;s position within treatment should be one where a full narcissistic transference should be encouraged instead of being challenged. To establish this, the analyst should be able to show empathic comprehension, which entails a receptivity to the narcissistic illusions and an avoidance at all costs of anything which would challenge them or suggest they are unrealistic. Heinz Kohut used the concepts of narcissistic transference and self-object needs. He also stressed the significance of infantilism and what appear to be excessive demands on the analyst and everyone else. Rather than instinctual wishes to be renounced, they are missed developmental needs to be warmly received and understood. The patient is groping toward self-cure, by trying to extract from others what was missing early in his development. Heinz Kohut feels the patient knows what he needs, regardless of what the analyst may think he knows. He stresses the importance of hopes in maturity and throughout development. There is an enduring need for ideals and idealization that vitalizes self experience. In his work with narcissistic patients, the defining feature of Heinz Kohut&#x27;s psychoanalytic methodology became therefore empathic immersion (or vicarious inspection), whereby he tried to put himself in his patient&#x27;s shoes. This view is certainly in contrast with Freud&#x27;s early view of the analyzability of narcissistic defenses as discussed above.

==== Approaches as regarded by Heinz Kohut and Otto F. Kernberg ====
Both Kohut and Kernberg regarded each other&#x27;s approaches as counterproductive.
From Kohut&#x27;s point of view, the methodical interpretive approach recommended by Kernberg is interpreted by the narcissistically vulnerable patient as an assault and generates intense narcissistic rage. As Kernberg instead recommends this methodology for treating these patients, self-psychology regards Kernberg as creating narcissism instead of treating it.
On the other hand, Kernberg (from the more traditional point of view) sees the approach of Kohut as leading to nothing. An unquestioning acceptance of the patient&#x27;s illusions with the assumption that they will eventually diminish of their own accord represents a collusion with the patient&#x27;s defenses. The analytic process is thereby subverted and the analyst never emerges as a figure who can meaningfully help the patient.

==== An integrative relational approach ====
However, Stephen A. Mitchell offers an integrative relational approach in which the perspectives of both Kernberg and Kohut are connected. In his opinion, &quot;the more traditional approach to narcissism highlights the important ways in which the narcissistic illusions are used defensively, but misses their role in health and creativity and in consolidating certain kinds of developmentally crucial relationships with others. The developmental-arrest approach (Kohut) had generated a perspective on narcissism which stresses the growth-enhancing function of narcissistic illusions, but overlooks the extent to which they often constrict and interfere in real engagements between the analysand and other people, including the analyst&quot;. Mitchell recommends a &quot;subtle dialectic between articulating and embracing the analysand&#x27;s illusions on the one hand, and the provision of larger context in which they can be experienced, on the other&quot;.

== Kernberg&#x27;s developmental model ==

One of Kernberg&#x27;s major contributions is his developmental model. This model is built on the developmental tasks one has to complete in order to develop healthy relationships. When one fails to accomplish a certain developmental task, this responds to the increased risk to develop certain psychopathologies. Whereby failing the first developmental task, which is psychic clarification of self and other, an increased risk of development of varieties of psychosis results. Not accomplishing the second task (overcoming splitting) results in an increased risk of developing a borderline personality disorder.

Furthermore, his developmental model includes Kernberg&#x27;s view about drives, in which he differs from Freud. Kernberg was obviously inspired by Melanie Klein, whose model draws mainly on the paranoid-schizoid position and on the depressive position. More elaborate information on Kernberg&#x27;s ideas can be found in a recent publication by Cohen M. (2000).

===First months===
Kernberg saw the infant in the first months of his life as struggling to sort out his experience on the basis of the affective valence of this experience. The infant moves back and forth between two different affective states. One state is characterized as pleasurable and gratified; the other state is unpleasurable, painful and frustrating. Regardless of what one is in, no distinction is made between self and other.

===Developmental tasks===

====First developmental task: psychic clarification of self and other====
The first developmental task embodies being able to make a distinction between what is self and what is other. When this task would not be accomplished, one cannot develop a dependable sense of the self as separate and distinct because one cannot make a distinction between one&#x27;s own experience and the experience of others. This failure is hypothesized to be the major precursor for all psychotic states. In schizophrenic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, psychic fragmentation) we can see a lack of being able to separate between internal and external world, own experience and experience of others, own mind and the mind of another.

====Second developmental task: overcome splitting====
The second developmental task is to overcome splitting. When the first developmental task is accomplished, one is able to differentiate between self-images and object images; however, these images remain segregated affectively. Loving self images and images of good objects are held together by positive affects, or libidinal affects. Hateful images of the self and bad, frustrating object images are held together by negative or aggressive affects. The good is separated from the bad. The developmental task is accomplished when the child is able to see objects as &quot;whole&quot;, meaning that the child can see objects as being both good and bad. Next to seeing &quot;whole&quot; objects, the child is required to see the self as being loving and hating, as being good and bad at the same time. When one fails to accomplish this second developmental task, this will result in a borderline pathology, meaning that objects or the self cannot be seen as both good and bad; something is good, or it is bad, but both affects cannot be in the same object together.

=== Developmental stages ===
Kernberg&#x27;s model of self and object development rests on five stages that delineate the growth of the internalized object relations units, some of which already start taking place during the precipitating stage. The stages are not static, but fluent.

*Stage 1 (0 to 1 month): Normal autism
This stage is marked by undifferentiated self-object representations. This stage is equated with Mahler, Pine and Bergman&#x27;s conception of autism.

*Stage 2 (2 months to 6–8 months): Normal symbiosis
In the beginning of this stage the child is unable to integrate opposing affective valences. Libidinally invested and aggressively invested representations are strictly separated into a &#x27;good&#x27; self-object representation and a &#x27;bad&#x27; self-object representation.

*Stage 3 (6–8 months to 18–36 months): Differentiation of self from object relations
In this stage the &#x27;good&#x27; self-object representation differentiates into a &#x27;good&#x27; self and a &#x27;good&#x27; object and shortly thereafter the &#x27;bad&#x27; self-object representation differentiates into a &#x27;bad&#x27; self and a &#x27;bad&#x27; object. A failure of the child to differentiate between self and other results in a psychotic personality organization; one has failed to accomplish the first developmental task and is stuck in stage II. Although in this stage differentiation between self and object has taken place the good and bad self and object representations are strictly separated through the mechanism of splitting in order to protect the ideal, good relationship with the mother from contamination by bad self representations and bad representations of her.

*Stage 4 (36+ months through the oedipal period): The integration of self representations and object representations
During this stage the &#x27;good&#x27; (libidinally invested) and &#x27;bad&#x27; (aggressively invested) self and object representations are integrated into a definite self-system and a total object representation. One is able to comprehend the possibility of the self or other containing both positive and negative characteristics. A failure of this results in a borderline personality organization; one has failed to accomplish the second developmental task and is stuck in stage III. Consequently, the good self and object must still be protected from the aggression by the splitting of good and bad.

*Stage 5: Consolidation of superego and ego integration
In this stage ego, superego and id are consolidated in definite intrapsychic structures.

By successfully completing all the developmental tasks, the child has developed a neurotic personality organization, which is the strongest personality structure.

==Kernberg&#x27;s view on drives==
In contrast with Freud&#x27;s perspective, drives are not inborn according to Kernberg. The libidinal and aggressive drives are shaped, developed over time by experiences of interactions with others. The child&#x27;s good and bad affects become consolidated and shaped into libidinal and aggressive drives. Good, pleasurable interactions with others consolidate, over time, into a pleasure-seeking (libidinal) drive. In the same way bad, unsatisfying and frustrating interactions with others, become consolidated into a destructive (aggressive) drive over time.

<text>Keijo Antero Liinamaa (6 April 1929 in Mänttä – 28 June 1980 in Helsinki) was a Finnish lawyer and politician who served as caretaker prime minister of Finland from June to November 1975.

Liinamaa, a lawyer specialising in labour law, began his career working for the Finnish Central Union of Trade Unions (SAK). In 1958, at only age 29, he became the town manager of Mänttä, an industrial municipality in Western Finland. Upon the creation of a nationwide labour dispute conciliation mechanism in the early 1960s, Liinamaa was appointed a regional labour dispute conciliator. In 1965 he became the National Labour Dispute Conciliator and held the post in 1965–1970 and 1979–1980.

In 1965–1967 due to turbulent economic winds, Liinamaa was faced with conciliating dozens of labour disputes. In his capacity as the National Conciliator of Finland, he was able to prevent several major strikes.

In 1967 Liinamaa was given a special task by Prime Minister Rafael Paasio: Liinamaa was to negotiate a comprehensive economical deal with employers&#x27; organisations and labour unions in order to prevent inflation due to rising wages. These negotiations resulted in the first Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement and brought fame to Liinamaa.

Radical changes in support of political parties in the parliamentary elections of 1970 led to severe political conflicts: No political coalition could be established to form a cabinet. President Urho Kekkonen appointed a caretaker cabinet headed by Teuvo Aura. Under Prime Minister Aura, Liinamaa served as the Minister of Justice for 63 days in May–July 1970, until a new coalition government was formed by Ahti Karjalainen.

Karjalainen&#x27;s coalition fell in the autumn of 1971, and early parliamentary elections were called. A second caretaker cabinet led by Teuvo Aura was appointed, where Liinamaa served as Minister of Labour from October 1971 to February 1972.

Following the election of 1975, the political parties couldn&#x27;t agree on terms for a coalition government. President Kekkonen appointed Keijo Liinamaa prime minister of a caretaker government that lasted from June to November 1975. Kekkonen&#x27;s intervention made possible the formation of a new coalition government under Martti Miettunen in the autumn of 1975.

<text>In common law jurisdictions, probate is the judicial process whereby a will is &quot;proved&quot; in a court of law and accepted as a valid public document that is the true last testament of the deceased; or whereby, in the absence of a legal will, the estate is settled according to the laws of intestacy that apply in the jurisdiction where the deceased resided at the time of their death.

The granting of probate is the first step in the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person&#x27;s property under a will. A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator&#x27;s (deceased person&#x27;s) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator&#x27;s assets in the manner specified in the testator&#x27;s will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.

==Terminology==

===Executor===

An executor is a person appointed by a will to act on behalf of the estate of the will-maker (the &quot;testator&quot;) upon his or her death. An executor is the legal personal representative of a deceased person&#x27;s estate. The appointment of an executor only becomes effective after the death of the testator. After the testator dies, the person named in the will as executor can decline or renounce the position, and if so should quickly notify the probate court accordingly.

Executors &quot;step into the shoes&quot; of the deceased and have similar rights and powers to wind up the personal affairs of the deceased. This may include continuing or filing lawsuits that the deceased was entitled to bring, making claims for wrongful death, paying off creditors, or selling or disposing of assets not particularly gifted in the will, among others. But the role of the executor is to resolve the testator&#x27;s estate and to distribute the estate to the beneficiaries or those otherwise entitled.

Sometimes, in England and Wales, a professional executor is named in the will – not a family member but (for example) a solicitor, bank or other financial institution. Professional executors will charge the estate for carrying out duties related to the administration of the estate; this can leave the family facing additional costs. It is possible to get a professional executor to renounce their role, meaning they will have no part in dealing with the estate; or to reserve their power, which means the remaining executors will carry out the related duties, but without the involvement of the professional executor.

===Administrator===
When a person dies without a will then the legal personal representative is known as the &quot;administrator&quot;.

This is commonly the closest relative, although that person can renounce their right to be administrator, in which case the right moves to the next closest relative. This often happens when parents or grandparents are first in line to become the administrator but renounce their rights on the grounds that they are elderly, do not possess knowledge of estate law, or feel that someone else is better suited to the task.

The appointment of an administrator follows a codified list establishing priority appointees. Classes of persons named higher on the list receive priority of appointment to those lower on the list. Although relatives of the deceased frequently receive priority over all others, creditors of the deceased and &#x27;any other citizen [of that jurisdiction]&#x27; may act as an administrator if there is some cognizable reason or relationship to the estate. Alternatively, if no other person qualifies or no other person accepts appointment, the court will appoint a representative from the local public administrator&#x27;s office.

===Etymology===
The English noun &quot;probate&quot; derives directly from the Latin verb &quot;probare&quot;, to try, test, prove, examine, more specifically from the verb&#x27;s past participle nominative neuter &quot;probatum&quot;, &quot;having been proved&quot;. Historically during many centuries a paragraph in Latin of standard format was written by scribes of the particular probate court below the transcription of the will, commencing with the words (for example): &quot;Probatum Londini fuit huiusmodi testamentum coram venerabili viro&quot; (name of approver) &quot;legum doctore curiae prerogativae Cantuariensis...&quot; (&quot;A testament of such a kind was proved at London in the presence of the venerable man ... doctor of law at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury...&quot;) The earliest usage of the English word was in 1463, defined as &quot;the official proving of a will&quot;. The term &quot;probative&quot;, used in the law of evidence, comes from the same Latin root but has a different English usage.

==Probate process==

Probate is a process of improvement that proves a will of a deceased person is valid, so their property can in due course be retitled (US terminology) or transferred to beneficiaries of the will. As with any legal proceeding, there are technical aspects to probate administration:
* Creditors must be notified and legal notices published.
* Executors of the will must be guided in how and when to distribute assets and how to take creditors&#x27; rights into account.
* A petition to appoint a personal representative may need to be filed and letters of administration (often referred to as &quot;letters testamentary&quot;) issued. A Grant of Letters of Administration can be used as proof that the &#x27;Administrator&#x27; is entitled to handle the assets.
* Homestead property, which follows its own set of unique rules in states like Florida, must be dealt with separately from other assets. In many common law jurisdictions such as Canada, parts of the US, the UK, Australia and India, any jointly-owned property passes automatically to the surviving joint owner separately from any will, unless the equitable title is held as tenants in common.
* There are time factors involved in filing and objecting to claims against the estate.
* There may be a lawsuit pending over the decedent&#x27;s death or there may have been pending suits that are now continuing. There may be separate procedures required in contentious probate cases.
* Real estate or other property may need to be sold to effect the correct distribution of assets pursuant to the will, or merely to pay debts.
* Estate taxes, gift taxes or inheritance taxes must be considered if the estate exceeds certain thresholds.
* Costs of the administration including ordinary taxation such as income tax on interest and property taxation are deducted from assets in the estate before distribution by the executors of the will.
* Other assets may simply need to be transferred from the deceased to his or her beneficiaries, such as life insurance. Other assets may have pay on death or transfer on death designations, which avoids probate.
* The rights of beneficiaries must be respected, in terms of providing proper and adequate notice, making timely distribution of estate assets, and otherwise administering the estate properly and efficiently.

Local laws governing the probate process often depend on the value and complexity of the estate. If the value of the estate is relatively small, the probate process may be avoided. In some jurisdictions and/or at a certain threshold, probate must be applied for by the executor/administrator or a probate lawyer filing on their behalf.

A probate lawyer offers services in probate court, and may be retained to open an estate or offer service during the course of probate proceedings on behalf of the administrator or executor of the estate. Probate lawyers may also represent heirs, creditors and other parties who have a legal interest in the outcome of the estate.

In common law jurisdictions, probate (&quot;official proving of a will&quot;) is obtained by executors of a will while letters of administration are granted where there are no executors.

== Australia ==
In Australia, probate can refer to the process of proving the will of a deceased person and also to a grant of probate, the legal document that is obtained.

There is a Supreme Court probate registry in each jurisdiction that deals with probate applications. However, each state and territory has slightly different laws and processes in relation to probate. The main probate legislation is as follows:
* New South Wales—Probate and Administration Act 1898.
* Victoria—Administration and Probate Act 1958.
* Queensland—Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 and Succession Act 1981.
* Western Australia—Non‑contentious Probate Rules 1967.
* South Australia—Administration and Probate Act 1919.
* Tasmania—Administration and Probate Act 1935.
* Australian Capital Territory—Administration and Probate Act 1929.
* Northern Territory—Administration and Probate Act 1993.

=== Application for grant of probate ===
Probate is required if the deceased person owned real property or if his or her other assets are above the threshold amount, which is usually $50,000 for major banks and lower thresholds for other financial institutions. Assets that had been “owned jointly” (but not assets held “in common”) pass automatically to the other joint owner and do not form part of the deceased estate. Also, benefits from life insurance on the deceased paid directly to a nominee are not part of the estate, nor are trust assets held by the deceased as trustee.

Applications for probate are made to the probate office in the jurisdiction with which the deceased has a close connection, not necessarily where the person died. Normally, only the executor of a will can apply for a grant of probate, and it is their duty to obtain probate in a timely manner. Executors can apply for probate themselves (which is often done to reduce legal fees) or be represented by a lawyer. With the application for probate, the applicant must also provide the original of the will, an official death certificate (not the one issued by a medical professional), a copy of the death notice and a statement of the known assets and liabilities of the deceased estate. The applicant may also be required to have published a notice in a major newspaper of an intention to make the application for probate.

=== Distribution of estate ===
After probate is granted, executors are empowered to deal with estate assets, including selling and transferring assets, for the benefit of the beneficiaries. For some transactions, an executor may be required to produce a copy of the probate as proof of authority to deal with property still in the name of the deceased person, as is invariably the case with the transfer or conveyance of land. Executors are also responsible for paying creditors and for distributing the residual assets in accordance with the will. Some Australian jurisdictions require a notice of intended distribution to be published before the estate is distributed.

==Canada==

Inheritance law in Canada is constitutionally a provincial matter. Therefore, the laws governing inheritance in Canada is legislated by each individual province.

===Ontario===
The probate process in Ontario is a legal process where a court approves the validity of a will and grants authority to the executor named in the will to distribute the deceased person&#x27;s assets according to the instructions in the will. The process generally involves the following steps:
* The executor applies for a certificate of appointment of estate trustee (probate) from the court, along with the original will and any required supporting documents.
* The court reviews the application and if satisfied that the will is valid and that the executor is suitable, it will issue a certificate of appointment of estate trustee.
* The executor uses the certificate to gather and manage the deceased person&#x27;s assets, pay any debts and taxes, and distribute the assets according to the instructions in the will.
* The executor must provide an inventory of the assets and liabilities of the estate and file it with the court and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries according to the Will.
* The executor must also file an estate information return with the Ministry of Finance within 90 days of being issued the certificate of appointment of estate trustee.
* Once the assets have been distributed and any debts have been paid, the executor will apply for a certificate of final distribution from the court, which will release the executor from their responsibilities.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
The main source of English law is the Wills Act 1837. Probate, as with the law of family settlements (trusts), was handled by the Court of Chancery. When that court was abolished in 1873, their jurisdiction passed to the Chancery Division of the High Court.

====Definition====
When someone dies, the term &quot;probate&quot; usually refers to the legal process whereby the deceased&#x27;s assets are collected together and, following various legal and fiscal steps and processes, eventually distributed to the beneficiaries of the estate. Technically the term has a particular legal meaning, but it is generally used within the English legal profession as a term to cover all procedures concerned with the administration of a deceased person&#x27;s estate. As a legal discipline the subject is vast and it is only possible in an article such as this to cover the most common situations, but even that only scratches the surface.

====Jurisdiction====
All legal procedures concerned with probate (as defined above) come within the jurisdiction of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice by virtue of Section 25 of the Senior Courts Act 1981. The High Court is, therefore, the only body able to issue documents that confer on someone the ability to deal with a deceased person&#x27;s estate—close bank accounts or sell property. It is the production and issuing of these documents, known collectively as &quot;grants of representation&quot;, that is the primary function of the Probate Registries, which are part of the High Court, which the general public and probate professionals alike apply to for grants of representation.

====Grants of representation====
There are many different types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a &quot;grant of probate&quot;. If there was no will, the grant required is likely to be a &quot;grant of administration&quot;. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.

=====Applying for a grant=====
A will includes the appointment of an executor or executors. One of their duties is to apply to the Probate Division of the High Court for a grant of probate. An executor can apply to a local probate registry for a grant themselves but most people use a probate practitioner such as a solicitor. If an estate is small, some banks and building societies allow the deceased&#x27;s immediate family to close accounts without a grant, but there usually must be less than about £15,000 in the account for this to be permitted.

====Asset distribution====
The persons who are actually given the job of dealing with the deceased&#x27;s assets are called &quot;personal representatives&quot; or &quot;PRs&quot;. If the deceased left a valid will, the PRs are the &quot;executors&quot; appointed by the will—&quot;I appoint X and Y to be my executors etc.&quot; If there is no will or if the will does not contain a valid appointment of executors (for example if they are all dead) then the PRs are called &quot;administrators&quot;. So, executors obtain a grant of probate that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a grant of administration that lets them do the same. Apart from that distinction, the function of executors and administrators is exactly the same.

====Probate requirements====
A requirement of the probate process is the valuation of the estate.

====Intestacy probate process====
For an explanation of the intestacy probate process in England and Wales, see Administration of an estate on death.

====Contesting the circumstances of a will&#x27;s creation====
An applicant may challenge the validity of a person&#x27;s will after they have died by lodging a caveat and requisite fee at the probate registry. This prevents anyone from obtaining a grant of probate for that person&#x27;s estate for six months, which the applicant can shortly before that point apply to extend. A caveat is not to be used to extend the time for bringing a claim for financial provision from a person&#x27;s estate, such as under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975. The court can order costs against an applicant using a caveat for that purpose.

To challenge the caveat, the intended executor sends a completed &quot;warning&quot; form to the probate registry. This document will be sent to the person who entered the caveat, and for the caveat to remain, they will have to enter an appearance at the probate registry. This is not a physical appearance; it is a further document to send to the probate registry within eight days of receiving the warning.

===Scotland===
The equivalent to probate in Scotland is confirmation, although there are considerable differences between the two systems because of the separate Scottish legal system. Appointment as an executor does not in itself grant authority to ingather and distribute the estate of the deceased; the executor(s) must make an application to the sheriff court for a grant of confirmation. This is a court order authorising them to &quot;uplift, receive, administer and dispose of the estate and to act in the office of executor&quot;. A grant or certificate of confirmation gives the executor(s) authority to uplift money or other property belonging to a deceased person (e.g. from a bank), and to administer and distribute it according to either the deceased&#x27;s will or the law on intestacy.

==United States==

Most estates in the United States include property that is subject to probate proceedings. If the property of an estate is not automatically devised to a surviving spouse or heir through principles of joint ownership or survivorship, or otherwise by operation of law, and was not transferred to a trust during the decedent&#x27;s lifetime, it is generally necessary to &quot;probate the estate&quot;, whether or not the decedent had a valid will. For example, life insurance and retirement accounts with properly completed beneficiary designations should avoid probate, as will most bank accounts titled jointly or made payable on death.

Some states have procedures that allow for the transfer of assets from small estates through affidavit or through a simplified probate process. For example, California has a &quot;Small Estate Summary Procedure&quot; to allow the summary transfer of a decedent&#x27;s asset without a formal probate proceeding. The dollar limit by which the small estate procedure can be effectuated was $150,000 before a statutory increase was implemented on a three-year schedule, arriving at $184,500 by April 2022.

For estates that do not qualify for simplified proceedings, a court having jurisdiction of the decedent&#x27;s estate (a probate court) supervises the probate process to ensure administration and disposition of the decedent&#x27;s property is conducted in accord with the law of that jurisdiction, and in a manner consistent with decedent&#x27;s intent as manifested in his will. Distribution of certain estate assets may require selling assets, including real estate.

===Avoiding probate===
Some of the decedent&#x27;s property may never enter probate because it passes to another person contractually, such as the death proceeds of an insurance policy insuring the decedent or bank or retirement account that names a beneficiary or is owned as &quot;payable on death&quot;, and property (sometimes a bank or brokerage account) legally held as &quot;jointly owned with right of survivorship&quot;.

Property held in a revocable or irrevocable trust created during the grantor&#x27;s lifetime also avoids probate. In these cases in the U.S. no court action is involved and the property is distributed privately, subject to estate taxes.

The best way to determine which assets are probate assets (requiring administration) is to determine whether each asset passes outside of probate.

In jurisdictions in the U.S. that recognize a married couple&#x27;s property as tenancy by the entireties, if a spouse (or partner in Hawaii) dies intestate (owning property without a will), the portion of his/her estate so titled passes to a surviving spouse without a probate.

===Steps of probate===

If the decedent dies without a will, known as intestacy, with the exception of real properly located in another jurisdiction, the estate is distributed according to the laws of the jurisdiction where the decedent resided.

If the decedent died with a will, the will usually names an executor (personal representative), who carries out the instructions laid out in the will. The executor marshals the decedent&#x27;s assets. If there is no will, or if the will does not name an executor, the probate court can appoint one. Traditionally, the representative of an estate is called an &quot;administrator&quot;. If the decedent died with a will, but only a copy of the will can be located, many states allow the copy to be probated, subject to the rebuttable presumption that the testator destroyed the will before death.

In some cases, where the person named as executor cannot administer the probate, or wishes to have someone else do so, another person is named administrator. An executor or an administrator may receive compensation for his service. Additionally, beneficiaries of an estate may be able to remove the appointed executor if he or she is not capable of properly fulfilling his or her duties.

The representative of a testate estate who is someone other than the executor named in the will is an &quot;administrator with the will annexed&quot;, or administrator c.t.a. (from the Latin &quot;cum testamento annexo&quot;.) The generic term for executors or administrators is personal representative.

The probate court may require that the executor provide a fidelity bond, an insurance policy in favor of the estate to protect against possible abuse by the executor.

After opening the probate case with the court, the personal representative inventories and collects the decedent&#x27;s property. Next, he pays any debts and taxes, including estate tax in the United States, if the estate is taxable at the federal or state level. Finally, he distributes the remaining property to the beneficiaries, either as instructed in the will, or under the intestacy laws of the state.

A party may challenge any aspect of the probate administration, such as a direct challenge to the validity of the will, known as a will contest, a challenge to the status of the person serving as personal representative, a challenge as to the identity of the heirs, and a challenge to whether the personal representative is properly administering the estate. Issues of paternity can be disputed among the potential heirs in intestate estates, especially with the advent of inexpensive DNA profiling techniques. In some situations, however, even biological heirs can be denied their inheritance rights, while non-biological heirs can be granted inheritance rights.

The personal representative must understand and abide by the fiduciary duties, such as a duty to keep money in interest bearing account and to treat all beneficiaries equally. Not complying with the fiduciary duties may allow interested persons to petition for the removal of the personal representative and hold the personal representative liable for any harm to the estate.

<doc id="1043004" wikidata="Q1344265" url="?curid=1043004" title="Filip Dewinter">
<text>Philip Michel Frans &quot;Filip&quot; Dewinter (born 11 September 1962) is a Belgian politician, journalist and commentator. He is one of the leading members of Vlaams Belang, a right-wing Flemish nationalist and secessionist political party.

==Family background and education==
His father was studying medicine at the Leuven University during World War II, when he had to hide, as the threat of being deported by the Germans increased. He was nevertheless arrested and already after a few months of imprisonment in Bruges, had been deported to Germany to work in a munitions factory. He returned, after the war, sick and emaciated and unable to take up his studies again.

Dewinter&#x27;s grandfather on his mother&#x27;s side was a resistance fighter who had been very active in the resistance group, the &quot;Witte Brigade&quot; (White Brigade), in Blankenberge.

Dewinter was already politically active during his high school years at the &quot;Sint-Franciscus-Xaverius instituut&quot; in Bruges. In 1978, as a 16-year-old, he founded the Flemish Student Action Group (&quot;Vlaamse Studenten Actie Groep&quot;), that later was transformed into the Nationalist Young Students League (&quot;Nationalistisch Jong Studenten Verbond&quot;). In September 1982, he moved to Antwerp where he began studying political and social sciences at the University of Antwerp but dropped out at the end of his first year. At university he became a member of the Nationalist Student Society (Nationalistische Studentenvereniging), one of the ideological seminaries of the Vlaams Belang. He completed a journalist degree at the Erasmus College (&quot;Erasmus Handelsschool&quot;) in 1985. After his studies he worked as a reporter for the newspaper &quot;De Nieuwe Gids&quot;, the Antwerp edition of &quot;Het Volk.&quot;

==Political career==
As a teenager, Dewinter was briefly a member of the national-liberal Flemish People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Vlaamse Volkspartij&quot;) founded by Lode Claes, one of the precursor parties of the Flemish Block (&quot;Vlaams Blok&quot;) which had split from the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party. In 1983, he became a member of Vlaams Blok. In November 1987, he was elected member of the Belgian parliament, in which he formed a political faction with Gerolf Annemans (who, earlier that year, had succeeded to founder-Flemish Block president Karel Dillen). Under Dewinter&#x27;s leadership, the parliamentary group continued to grow, notably in 1991, when the Flemish Block, from a small party, grew to about 12% of the voters. This growth has continued ever since.

In 1988, he also became a City councilman in Antwerp. When the Flemish Parliament and the Belgian Parliament got elected separately in 1995, he chose to be a member of the Flemish Parliament (which deals with a lot of regional matters). His hard statements on especially foreign migration provided for victories in the elections of 1999 and 2003 for the Flemish Parliament. Dewinter was, together with Gerolf Annemans, the author of the notorious &#x27;70-puntenplan&#x27; published in the beginning of the 1990s, a policy paper consisting of 70 articles.

In 2006, he was quoted in Bye-bye Belgium, which some Belgian politicians saw as a break of the cordon sanitaire.

Together with Hugo Coveliers of the VLOTT party, Dewinter formed a list cartel for the city elections of Antwerp on 8 October 2006.

In 2010, he participated in a conference in Israel organised by Likud on the fight against terrorism.

An extreme right-wing activist is sentenced to five years in prison in 2014 for planning the murder of Filip Dewinter, hoping to drag Belgium into civil war.

In October 2022, Dewinter was physically assaulted by a left-wing activist while giving a talk at a community centre in Kessel-Lo. The incident was condemned by CD&amp;V chairman Sammy Mahdi, MR chairman Georges-Louis Bouchez, and Flemish minister Zuhal Demir of the N-VA.

On March 25, 2024, an investigation by Humo magazine and the &quot;Apache&quot; website revealed that Filip Dewinter had worked for several years as a &quot;senior political advisor&quot; for China.

One month later it was revealed that Filip Dewinter was also involved in the then uncovered Russian Influential Network &quot;Voice of Europe&quot;.

==Views==

===Flemish nationalism and Nazi collaboration===
On 6 November 1988, Filip Dewinter visited the Lommel German war cemetery where 40,000 bodies of Nazi Germany Wehrmacht soldiers of WWII were buried. He and other members of his party, notably neo-Nazi Bert Eriksson, wanted to render respect and flower the graves of the 38 Flemish SS collaborators who fought for Nazi Germany and embraced fascist Nazi ideology. The Belgian police forces stopped the small rally and pushed them back; only holders of German citizenship were allowed to enter the cemetery. During a debate in 1992 at the University of Antwerp, Filip Dewinter mentioned some persons as his friends. Most of these persons were in the ranks of Nazis, anti Semites and other fascists like Bert Eriksson, Staf De Clercq or other men convicted for treason like Cyriel Verschaeve or August Borms.

Filip Dewinter was the guest speaker for a gathering of the former SS-collaborators of Sint-Maartensfonds which took place on 1 December 2001. That evening, Filip Dewinter opened his speech with the words &quot;My Honour is loyalty&quot; which was the official motto of the German SS-soldiers during WWII.

Dewinter has also been interviewed by the Israeli paper &quot;Haaretz&quot;. About the collaboration of Flemish nationalists during WWII he had to say:
Many Flemish nationalists collaborated during the war because they thought—and now it is clear that they were wrong—that this would help them achieve independence for Flanders. This is the whole story. The overwhelming majority were not Nazis. They collaborated in order to attain independence and because the Church called upon them to go out and fight the Communists—something that Western Europe continued to do for 50 years. Now, in 2005, it is easy to say: &#x27;The collaboration was a mistake.&#x27; The collaboration did not help our country at all; we just became a vassal state of Germany. At the time, it was logical, because of the Church, because of communism. But this has no connection with Nazism.

In addition, as noted by the Stephen Roth Institute, Dewinter has been interviewed by the American radio talk show The Political Cesspool.

About the attendance of party members to ceremonies marking the death of Staf De Clercq he responded:
He is one of the historic leaders of the party. This is part of the history of the Flemish nationalist movement and it is impossible to deny this. We are the descendants of this movement. Some of the members of the party attend these events because they want to honor the heritage of the Flemish movement. This does not mean that they agree with Nazism. Not at all. I understand that this is hard to understand as a Jew. I respect very much that Jews have a problem with this. But Jews must also understand that this is not as simple as it seems. Not all of the [Nazi] collaborators wanted to kill the Jews in Europe. Most of the collaborators had other motives. I think that if they were living today, most of them would be ashamed of what happened to the Jews. The only thing I can do today is to say that I respect very much the suffering of the Jewish people, to express my sympathy and condolences about what happened and to try to move far away from this. But the Jewish people must understand that not every collaborator was necessarily anti-Semitic.

=== Judaism and Islam===
A December 2005 interview by Dewinter with the American Jewish newsweekly &quot;The Jewish Week&quot; included a question if &quot;Jews should vote for a party that espouses xenophobia&quot;. Dewinter responded by saying: &quot;Xenophobia is not the word I would use. If it absolutely must be a &#x27;phobia,&#x27; let it be &#x27;Islamophobia.&#x27;&quot; This statement, as well as the Blok&#x27;s condemnation for racism, have weighted heavily on the French-speaking Belgian Socialist Party as well as other francophone and Flemish parties for them to become part of an appeal against the Vlaams Belang at the Council of State, an appeal that tries to take away the government subsidy of the Vlaams Belang.

In 2007 Dewinter took part in hosting the international counter-jihad conference in Brussels in the European and Flemish Parliaments.

==Quotes==

*&quot;Vlaams Blok says: Our own people first!! And yes, Vlaams Blok chooses a Flemish Flanders. And yes, Vlaams Blok chooses a white Europe!&quot; (Vlaams Blok-meeting, 1991).
*&quot;She who wears a hijab signs her &#x27;return to sender&#x27; contract.&quot;
*&quot;He who sows the Koran reaps the jihad&quot;.
*&quot;[Immigrants] turn themselves into self pity. They become hostile, they cause nuisance and show criminal behaviour. In Flanders the multicultural society led to a multicriminal society.&quot;
*&quot;Staf de Clercq is one of the historical leaders of the Flemish national movement. Our party, the Vlaams Belang, is the continuator of this movement. We may not deny this past. Although I realise that it might be difficult for Jewish readers to understand, most collaborators thought that they could realise an independent Flanders by cooperating with the Germans. Most of them are ashamed of the horror they caused. The only thing I can do today is to show understanding for the suffering of the Jewish people.&quot;

<doc id="1043012" wikidata="Q280027" url="?curid=1043012" title="Uveitis">
<text>Uveitis () is inflammation of the uvea, the pigmented layer of the eye between the inner retina and the outer fibrous layer composed of the sclera and cornea. The uvea consists of the middle layer of pigmented vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis is described anatomically, by the part of the eye affected, as anterior, intermediate or posterior, or panuveitic if all parts are involved. Anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis) is the most common, with the incidence of uveitis overall affecting approximately 1:4500, most commonly those between the ages of 20–60. Symptoms include eye pain, eye redness, floaters and blurred vision, and ophthalmic examination may show dilated ciliary blood vessels and the presence of cells in the anterior chamber. Uveitis may arise spontaneously, have a genetic component, or be associated with an autoimmune disease or infection. While the eye is a relatively protected environment, its immune mechanisms may be activated resulting in inflammation and tissue destruction associated with T-cell activation.

Uveitis is an ophthalmic emergency that requires urgent control of the inflammation to prevent vision loss. Treatment typically involves the use of topical eye drop steroids, intravitreal injection, newer biologics, and treating any underlying disease. While initial treatment is usually successful, complications include other ocular disorders, such as uveitic glaucoma, retinal detachment, optic nerve damage, cataracts, and in some cases, a permanent loss of vision. In the United States uveitis accounts for about 10–20% of cases of blindness.
== Classification ==
Uveitis is classified anatomically into anterior, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis forms—based on the part of the eye primarily affected. Before the twentieth century, uveitis was typically referred to in English as &quot;ophthalmia.&quot;

* &quot;Anterior uveitis&quot; includes iridocyclitis and iritis. Iritis is the inflammation of the anterior chamber and iris. Iridocyclitis is inflammation of the iris and ciliary body with inflammation predominantly confined to the ciliary body. Between 66% and 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location (iritis). This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature.
* &quot;Intermediate uveitis&quot;, also known as pars planitis, consists of vitritis—which is inflammation of cells in the vitreous cavity, sometimes with &quot;snowbanking&quot;, or deposition of inflammatory material on the pars plana. There are also &quot;snowballs,&quot; which are inflammatory cells in the vitreous.
* &quot;Posterior uveitis&quot; or chorioretinitis is the inflammation of the retina and choroid.
* &quot;Panuveitis&quot; is the inflammation of all layers of the uvea.

== Causes ==
Uveitis is usually an isolated illness, but can be associated with many other medical conditions. In anterior uveitis, no associated condition or syndrome is found in approximately one-half of cases. However, anterior uveitis is often one of the syndromes associated with HLA-B27. Presence of this type of HLA allele has a relative risk of evolving this disease by approximately 15%.

The most common form of uveitis is acute anterior uveitis (AAU). It is most commonly associated with HLA-B27, which has important features: HLA-B27 AAU can be associated with ocular inflammation alone or in association with systemic disease. HLA-B27 AAU has characteristic clinical features including male preponderance, unilateral alternating acute onset, a non-granulomatous appearance, and frequent recurrences, whereas HLA-B27 negative AAU has an equivalent male to female onset, bilateral chronic course, and more frequent granulomatous appearance. Rheumatoid arthritis is not uncommon in Asian countries as a significant association of uveitis.

===Noninfectious or autoimmune causes===

* Sympathetic ophthalmia
* Behçet disease
* Crohn&#x27;s disease
* Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* HLA-B27 related uveitis
* Spondyloarthritis (especially seen in ankylosing spondylitis)
* Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
* Sarcoidosis
* Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome

===Associated with systemic diseases===
Systemic disorders that can be associated with uveitis include:
*Enthesitis
*Ankylosing spondylitis
*Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
*psoriatic arthritis
*reactive arthritis
*Behçet&#x27;s disease
*inflammatory bowel disease
*Whipple&#x27;s disease
*systemic lupus erythematosus
*polyarteritis nodosa
*Kawasaki&#x27;s disease
*chronic granulomatous disease
*sarcoidosis
*multiple sclerosis
*Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease

=== Infectious causes ===
Uveitis may be an immune response to fight an infection caused by an organism in the eye. They are less common than non-infectious causes and require antimicrobial/ viral/ parasitic treatment in addition to inflammatory control. Infectious causes in order of global burden include:

* bartonellosis
* tuberculosis
* brucellosis
* herpesviruses (herpes zoster ophthalmicus - shingles of the eye)
* leptospirosis
* presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome
* syphilis
* toxocariasis
* toxoplasmic chorioretinitis
* Lyme disease
* Zika fever

===Drug-related side effects===
*Rifabutin, a derivative of Rifampin, has been shown to cause uveitis.
*Several reports suggest the use of quinolones, especially Moxifloxacin, may lead to uveitis.

===White dot syndromes===
Occasionally, uveitis is not associated with a systemic condition: the inflammation is confined to the eye and has unknown cause. In some of these cases, the presentation in the eye is characteristic of a described syndrome, which are called white dot syndromes, and include the following diagnoses:

*acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy
*birdshot chorioretinopathy
*multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis
*multiple evanescent white dot syndrome
*punctate inner choroiditis
*serpiginous choroiditis
*acute zonal occult outer retinopathy

===Masquerade syndromes===
Masquerade syndromes are those conditions that include the presence of intraocular cells but are not due to immune-mediated uveitis entities. These may be divided into neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.
*Non-neoplastic:
:*retinitis pigmentosa
:*intraocular foreign body
:*juvenile xanthogranuloma
:*retinal detachment
*Neoplastic:
:*retinoblastoma
:*lymphoma
:*malignant melanoma
:*leukemia
:*reticulum cell sarcoma

==Signs and symptoms==

The disease course, anatomy, and laterality can vary widely and are important to consider in diagnosis and treatment. Cases may be acute (sudden onset with &lt; 3 month duration) and monophonic, acute and recurrent, or chronic. The signs and symptoms of uveitis may include the following:

===Anterior uveitis (iritis)===
* Pain in the eye(s)
* Redness of the eye(s)
* Blurred vision
* Photophobia
* Irregular pupil
* Signs of anterior uveitis include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates (&quot;KP&quot;) on the posterior surface of the cornea. In severe inflammation there may be evidence of a hypopyon. Old episodes of uveitis are identified by pigment deposits on lens, KPs, and festooned pupil on dilation of pupil.
*&quot;Busacca nodules&quot;, inflammatory nodules located on the surface of the iris in granulomatous forms of anterior uveitis such as Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI).
* Synechia, adhesion of the iris to the cornea (anterior synechiae) or more commonly the lens (posterior synechiae) 

===Intermediate uveitis===
Most common:
*Floaters, which are dark spots that float in the visual field
* Blurred vision
Intermediate uveitis usually affects one eye. Less common is the presence of pain and photophobia.

===Posterior uveitis===
Inflammation in the back of the eye is commonly characterized by:
* Floaters
* Blurred vision

==Pathophysiology==

===Immunological factors===
Onset of uveitis can broadly be described as a failure of the ocular immune system and the disease results from inflammation and tissue destruction. Uveitis is driven by the Th17 T cell sub-population that bear T-cell receptors specific for proteins found in the eye. These are often not deleted centrally whether due to ocular antigen not being presented in the thymus (therefore not negatively selected) or a state of anergy is induced to prevent self targeting.

Autoreactive T cells must normally be held in check by the suppressive environment produced by microglia and dendritic cells in the eye. These cells produce large amounts of TGF beta and other suppressive cytokines, including IL-10, to prevent damage to the eye by reducing inflammation and causing T cells to differentiate to inducible T reg cells. Innate immune stimulation by bacteria and cellular stress is normally suppressed by myeloid suppression while inducible Treg cells prevent activation and clonal expansion of the autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells that possess potential to cause damage to the eye.

Whether through infection or other causes, this balance can be upset and autoreactive T cells allowed to proliferate and migrate to the eye. Upon entry to the eye, these cells may be returned to an inducible Treg state by the presence of IL-10 and TGF-beta from microglia. Failure of this mechanism leads to neutrophil and other leukocyte recruitment from the peripheral blood through IL-17 secretion. Tissue destruction is mediated by non-specific macrophage activation and the resulting cytokine cascades. Serum TNF-α is significantly elevated in cases while IL-6 and IL-8 are present in significantly higher quantities in the aqueous humour in patients with both quiescent and active uveitis. These are inflammatory markers that non-specifically activate local macrophages causing tissue damage.

===Genetic factors===
The cause of non-infectious uveitis is unknown but there are some strong genetic factors that predispose disease onset including HLA-B27 and the PTPN22 genotype.

===Infectious agents===
Recent evidence has pointed to reactivation of herpes simplex, varicella zoster and other viruses as important causes of developing what was previously described as idiopathic anterior uveitis. Bacterial infection is another significant contributing factor in developing uveitis.

==Diagnosis==
Uveitis is assessed as part of a dilated eye exam. Diagnosis includes dilated fundus examination to rule out posterior uveitis, which presents with white spots across the retina along with retinitis and vasculitis.

Laboratory testing is usually used to diagnose specific underlying diseases, including rheumatologic tests (e.g. antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor) and serology for infectious diseases (Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, Tuberculosis).

Major histocompatibility antigen testing may be performed to investigate genetic susceptibility to uveitis. The most common antigens include HLA-B27, HLA-A29 (in birdshot chorioretinopathy) and HLA-B51 (in Behçet disease).

Radiology X-ray may be used to show coexisting arthritis and chest X-ray may be helpful in sarcoidosis.

==Treatment==
Uveitis is typically treated with glucocorticoid steroids, either as topical eye drops (prednisolone acetate) or as oral therapy. Prior to the administration of corticosteroids, corneal ulcers must be ruled out. This is typically done using a fluorescence dye test. In addition to corticosteroids, topical cycloplegics, such as atropine or homatropine, may be used. Successful treatment of active uveitis increases T-regulatory cells in the eye, which likely contributes to disease regression.
In severe cases an injection of posterior subtenon triamcinolone acetate may also be given to reduce the swelling of the eye.
Intravitrial injection of steroid has proven to be a newer useful way to control inflammation for longer without the need for daily eyedrops. Dexamethasone and fluocinolone acetonide are two more commonly used options for noninfectious uveitis.

Non-biologic, steroid sparing therapies for noninfectious uveitis in adults are now more available. These include the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and tacrolimus. In comparing various studies, methotrexate is more efficacious than mycophenolate in inflammatory control for most forms of panuveitis. Methotrexate also had little to no differences in safety outcomes compared to mycophenolate.

Antimetabolite medications, such as methotrexate are often used for recalcitrant or more aggressive cases of uveitis. Experimental treatments with Infliximab or other anti-TNF infusions may prove helpful.

The anti-diabetic drug metformin is reported to inhibit the process that causes the inflammation in uveitis.

In the case of herpetic uveitis, anti-viral medications, such as valaciclovir or aciclovir, may be administered to treat the causative viral infection.

==Epidemiology==

Uveitis affects approximately 1 in 4500 people and is most common between the ages 20 to 60 with men and women affected equally. In western countries, anterior uveitis accounts for between 50% and 90% of uveitis cases. In Asian countries the proportion is between 28% and 50%. Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10%-20% of the blindness in the United States.

For non-infectious uveitis, women are more likely (57%) to be affected than men, possibly due to their higher prevalence of related autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D deficiency and smoking are risk factors for non-infectious uveitis.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis is generally good for those who receive prompt diagnosis and treatment, but serious complication including cataracts, uveitic glaucoma, band keratopathy, macular edema and permanent vision loss may result if left untreated. The type of uveitis, as well as its severity, duration, and responsiveness to treatment or any associated illnesses, all factor into the outlook.

<text>In biochemistry, phosphorylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a phosphate group from an inorganic phosphate (phosphate+hydrogen) to an acceptor.

:A-B + P A + P-B

They include allosteric enzymes that catalyze the production of glucose-1-phosphate from a glucan such as glycogen, starch or maltodextrin.

Phosphorylase is also a common name used for glycogen phosphorylase in honor of Earl W. Sutherland Jr., who in the late 1930s discovered it as the first phosphorylase.

== Function ==
Phosphorylases should not be confused with phosphatases, which remove phosphate groups.
In more general terms, phosphorylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a phosphate group from an inorganic phosphate (phosphate + hydrogen) to an acceptor, not to be confused with a phosphatase (a hydrolase) or a kinase (a phosphotransferase). A phosphatase removes a phosphate group from a donor using water, whereas a kinase transfers a phosphate group from a donor (usually ATP) to an acceptor.

== Types ==
The phosphorylases fall into the following categories:
*Glycosyltransferases (EC 2.4)
**Enzymes that break down glucans by removing a glucose residue (break &quot;O&quot;-glycosidic bond)
***glycogen phosphorylase
***starch phosphorylase
***maltodextrin phosphorylase
**Enzymes that break down nucleosides into their constituent bases and sugars (break &quot;N&quot;-glycosidic bond)
***Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase)
*Nucleotidyltransferases (EC 2.7.7)
**Enzymes that have phosphorolytic 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; exoribonuclease activity (break phosphodiester bond)
***RNase PH
***Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (PNPase)

All known phosphorylases share catalytic and structural properties.

== Activation ==
Phosphorylase a is the more active R form of glycogen phosphorylase that is derived from the phosphorylation of the less active R form, phosphorylase b with associated AMP. The inactive T form is either phosphorylated by phosphoylase kinase and inhibited by glucose, or dephosphorylated by phosphoprotein phosphatase with inhibition by ATP and/or glucose 6-phosphate. Phosphorylation requires ATP but dephosphorylation releases free inorganic phosphate ions.

== Pathology ==
Some disorders are related to phosphorylases:

* Glycogen storage disease type V - muscle glycogen
* Glycogen storage disease type VI - liver glycogen

*Hydrolase

<text>Jan Henryk Dąbrowski (; also known as Johann Heinrich Dąbrowski (Dombrowski) in German and Jean Henri Dombrowski in French; 2 August 1755 – 6 June 1818) was a Polish general and statesman, widely respected after his death for his patriotic attitude, and described as a national hero who spent his whole life fighting to restore the legacy and self-determination of Poland.

Dąbrowski initially served in the Saxon Army and joined the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Army in 1792, shortly before the Second Partition of Poland. He was promoted to the rank of general in the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794. After the final Third Partition of Poland, which ended the existence of Poland as an independent country, he became actively involved in promoting the cause of Polish independence abroad. He was the founder of the Polish Legions in Italy serving under Napoleon Bonaparte from 1795, and as a general in Italian and French service he contributed to the brief restoration of the Polish state during the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806. He participated in the Napoleonic Wars, taking part in the Polish-Austrian war and the French invasion of Russia until 1813. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, he accepted a senatorial position in the Russian-backed Congress Poland, and was one of the organizers of the Army of Congress Poland.

The Polish national anthem, &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;, written and first sung by the Polish legionnaires, mentions Dąbrowski by name, and is also known as &quot;Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Dąbrowski was born to Jan Michał Dąbrowski and Zofia Maria Dąbrowska ( Sophie von Lettow), in Pierzchów, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, on 29 August 1755. He grew up in Hoyerswerda, Electorate of Saxony, where his father served as a colonel in the Saxon Army. He joined the Royal Saxon Horse Guards in 1770 or 1771. His family was of Polish origin. Nonetheless, in his childhood and youth he grew up surrounded by German culture in Saxony, and signed his name as Johann Heinrich Dąbrowski. He fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779), during which time his father died. Shortly afterwards in 1780 he married Gustawa Rackel. He lived in Dresden, and steadily progressed through the ranks, becoming a Rittmeister in 1789. He served as Adjutant general of King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, from 1788 to 1791.

==Early career==
Following the appeal of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and not seeing much opportunity to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792, Dąbrowski joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in the final weeks of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, he did not see combat in it. Unfamiliar with the intricacies of Polish politics, like many of Poniatowski&#x27;s supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.

Dąbrowski was seen as a cavalry expert, and King Stanisław August Poniatowski was personally interested in obtaining Dąbrowski&#x27;s services. As a cavalryman educated in a Dresden military school under Count Maurice Bellegarde, a reformer of the Saxon army&#x27;s cavalry, Dąbrowski was asked to help modernize the Polish cavalry, serving in the ranks of the 1st Greater Poland Cavalry Brigade (&quot;1 Wielkpolska Brygada Kawalerii Narodowej&quot;). In January 1793, stationed around Gniezno with two units of cavalry, about 200 strong, he briefly engaged the Prussian forces entering Poland in the aftermath of the Second Partition of Poland, and afterwards became a known activist, advocating the continuation of military struggle against the occupiers.

The Grodno Sejm, held in the fall of 1793, nominated him for a membership in a military commission; this caused him to be viewed with suspicion by the majority of the dissatisfied military, and he was not included in the preparations for the upcoming uprising. Thus he was taken by surprise when the Kościuszko Insurrection erupted, and his own brigade mutinied. He declared his support for the insurgents after the liberation of Warsaw, and from then on took an active part in the uprising, defending Warsaw and leading an army corps in support of an uprising in Greater Poland. His courage was commended by Tadeusz Kościuszko himself, the Supreme Commander of the National Armed Forces, who promoted him to the rank of general.

==In Napoleonic service==
After the failure of the uprising he remained in partitioned Poland for a while, attempting to convince the Prussian authorities that they needed Poland as an ally against Austria and Russia. He was unsuccessful, and with the Third Partition of Poland between Russia, Prussia and Austria, Poland disappeared from the map of Europe. Dąbrowski&#x27;s next solution was to convince the French Republic that it should support a Polish cause, and create a Polish military formation. This proved to be more successful, and indeed Dąbrowski is remembered in the history of Poland as the organiser of Polish Legions in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. (These Legions are also often known as the &quot;Dąbrowski&#x27;s Legions&quot;.) This event gave hope to contemporary Poles, and is still remembered in the Polish national anthem, named after Dąbrowski.

Dąbrowski began his work in 1796, when he came to Paris and soon afterwards met Napoleon Bonaparte in Milan. On 7 January 1797 he was authorized by the Cisalpine Republic to create Polish legions, which would be part of the army of the newly created Republic of Lombardy. In April, Dąbrowski lobbied for a plan to push through to the Polish territories in Galicia, but that was blocked by Napoleon who instead decided to use those troops on the Italian front. Dąbrowski&#x27;s Polish soldiers fought at Napoleon&#x27;s side from May 1797 until the beginning of 1803. As a commander of his legion he played an important part in the war in Italy, entered Rome in May 1798, and distinguished himself greatly at the Battle of Trebia on 19 June 1799, where he was wounded, as well as in other battles and combats of 1799–1801.

From the time the Legions garrisoned Rome, Dąbrowski obtained a number of trophies from a Roman representative, namely the ones that the Polish king, Jan III Sobieski, had sent there after his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the siege of Vienna in 1683; amongst these was an Ottoman standard which subsequently became part of the Legions&#x27; colors, accompanying them from then on. However, the legions were never able to reach Poland and did not liberate the country, as Dąbrowski had dreamed. Napoleon did, however, notice the growing dissatisfaction of his soldiers and their commanders. They were particularly disappointed by a peace treaty between France and Russia signed in Lunéville on 9 February 1801, which dashed Polish hopes of Bonaparte freeing Poland. Shortly afterwards, in March, Dąbrowski reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6,000-strong units. Disillusioned with Napoleon after the Lunéville treaty, many legionnaires resigned afterwards; of the others, thousands perished when the Legions were sent in the Saint-Domingue expedition in 1803; by that time Dąbrowski was no longer in command of the Legions.

Dąbrowski, meanwhile, spent the first few years of the new century as a general in the service of the Italian Republic and its successor, the Kingdom of Italy. In 1804 he received the Officer cross of Legion of Honour, and the next year, the Italian Order of the Iron Crown. In December 1805, during the War of the Third Coalition, Dąbrowski participated in the Italian blockade of Venice, and was briefly commander of the province of Pescara in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples the following year. Together with Józef Wybicki he was summoned again by Napoleon in the fall of 1806 and tasked with recreating the Polish formation, which Napoleon wanted to use to recapture Greater Poland from Prussia, which had joined the Fourth Coalition against France. The ensuing conflict was known as the Greater Poland Uprising, and Dabrowski was the chief leader of Polish insurgent forces. In February 1807, the remaining infantry and cavalry regiments who had continued in French service in Italy were reorganized in Silesia, in the cities of Wrocław, Prudnik, Nysa, Korfantów and Brzeg, into a Polish-Italian Legion (&quot;PolaccoItalienne&quot;). Dąbrowski distinguished himself at the Siege of Tczew, the Siege of Gdańsk and at the Battle of Friedland.
In 1807, the Duchy of Warsaw was established in the recaptured territories, essentially as a satellite of Bonaparte&#x27;s France. Dąbrowski became disappointed with Napoleon, who offered him monetary rewards, but no serious military or government position. He was also awarded the Virtuti Militari medal that year. In 1809, he set out to defend Poland against an Austrian invasion under the command of Prince Józef Poniatowski. Joining the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw shortly after the Battle of Raszyn, he took part in the first stages of the offensive on Galicia, and then organized the defense of Greater Poland. In June 1812, Dąbrowski commanded the 17th (Polish) Infantry Division in the V Corps of the Grande Armée, during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. He was ordered to besiege Babruysk fortress and to cover the right flank of the French army near Mogilev and Minsk. However, by October the Franco-Russian war was over and the French forces, decimated by a severe winter, had to retreat. At the disastrous Battle of the Berezina in late November that year, Dąbrowski was wounded, and his leadership and tactics in it were criticized.

After the March 1813 reorganization of the Grande Armée, Dąbrowski commanded the 27th (Polish) Infantry Division in the VIII Corps under Poniatowski. During the German campaign of 1813, he led his division at the Battle of Leipzig, where he took command of the VIII Corps on 19 October following Poniatowski&#x27;s death. On 28 October he became the commander-in-chief of the all remaining Polish troops in French service, succeeding Antoni Paweł Sułkowski. He defended Compiègne in February 1814 during the invasion of France, then led his soldiers back to Poland in May after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication.

==Final years==
Dąbrowski always associated independent Poland with a Polish Army, and offered his services to the new power, which promised to organize such a formation: Russia. He was one of the generals entrusted by the Tsar Alexander of Russia with the reorganization of the Duchy&#x27;s army into the Army of Congress Poland. In 1815 he received the titles of general of cavalry and senator-voivode of the new Congress Kingdom. He was also awarded the Order of the White Eagle on 9 December that year. Soon afterward he withdrew from active politics. He retired in the following year to his estates in Winna Góra in the Grand Duchy of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia, where he died on 6 June 1818, from a combination of pneumonia and gangrene. He was buried in the church in Winna Góra.

Over the years, Dąbrowski wrote several military treatises, primarily about the Legions, in German, French and Polish.

==Remembrance==
Dąbrowski was often criticized by his contemporaries, and by the early Polish historiography, but his image improved with time. He has been often compared to the two other military heroes of the time of Partitions and the Legions, Tadeusz Kościuszko and Józef Poniatowski, and to the father of the Second Polish Republic, Józef Piłsudski. In particular, his mention in the Polish national anthem, also known as &quot;Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurek&quot;, contributed to his fame in Poland. It is not uncommon for modern works of Polish history to describe him as a &quot;(national) hero&quot;.

Dąbrowski is also remembered outside of Poland for his historical contributions. His name, in the French version &quot;Dombrowsky&quot;, is inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

<doc id="1043020" wikidata="Q3052515" url="?curid=1043020" title="Pier Head">
<text>The Pier Head (properly, George&#x27;s Pier Head) is a riverside location in the city centre of Liverpool, England. It was part of the former Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was inscribed in 2004, but revoked in 2021.
As well as a collection of landmark buildings, recreational open space, and a number of memorials, the Pier Head was (and for some traffic still is) the landing site for passenger ships travelling to and from the city.

==History==

By the 1890s, the George&#x27;s Dock, where the Pier Head now is, was essentially redundant. Built in 1771, it was the third dock built in Liverpool, and was too small and too shallow in depth for the commercial ships of the late 19th century. Most of the site was owned by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, set up by Parliament in 1857; a small part of the site still was still held by the Corporation of the City of Liverpool. The board and the corporation had differing priorities, and the former were not inclined to forgo any commercial advantage for the benefit of the latter.

In January 1896, the two bodies began discussions, with the corporation&#x27;s team headed by Frederick, Lord Derby (who was then the city&#x27;s Lord Mayor), and the Board&#x27;s representatives led by Robert Gladstone, a member of the Liverpool family of which W.E. Gladstone was the best-known. The Corporation sought to persuade the Board to accept its offer to buy the site, reserving a portion of it for new Board offices. After two years of negotiation this was agreed, and Parliamentary authority was obtained for the deal. The Corporation paid £277,399 for the site, from which the Board reserved about 13,500 square yards for its own building.

The board pressed ahead with its new headquarters, and announced a competition, restricted to local architects, to be adjudicated by Alfred Waterhouse. Despite some protests in national architectural journals about the exclusion of architects from beyond Liverpool, the local firm of Briggs, Wolstenholme, Hobbs and Thornley was appointed. A neo-baroque design was approved, with a central dome added at the last minute before the final plans were adopted in time for the start of building work in March 1903. The building was opened in the summer of 1907.

When it acquired the site, the corporation had been confident of finding tenants for the two remaining plots suitable for large-scale buildings, but no such prospective tenants came forward, and it was decided to offer the freehold of the sites for sale. However, at an auction of the sites in 1905 there were no bidders. The following year, the Royal Liver Friendly Society made an approach through Walter Aubrey Thomas, a local architect, successfully offering considerably less for a site than the corporation had hoped for: £70,000 instead of £95,000. Gladstone and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board expressed consternation at the height of the Royal Liver Society&#x27;s proposed new headquarters, sometimes described as &quot;England&#x27;s first skyscraper&quot;, but after much debate the corporation approved the plans.

The last of the three Pier Head sites between the Liver Building and the Docks and Harbour Board offices was for some time intended to be developed on behalf of the corporation, partly to replace a nearby public baths and partly as offices for the city&#x27;s new tram network. This scheme fell through, and in the early years of the 20th century a combined public baths and customs house was proposed. After several years that scheme, too, came to nothing, and in 1913 the Cunard shipping line announced its intention to build a new headquarters in Liverpool. The Cunard Building was built of reinforced concrete, clad in Portland Stone, in a style intended to recall grand Italian palaces, described by the architectural historian Peter De Figueiredo as &quot;a match for its more ostentatious neighbours in expressive power but greatly superior in refinement of detail and proportion.&quot;

In 2002, the Pier Head, and the adjacent Mann Island, were subjected to an ill-fated development scheme known as the &quot;Fourth Grace&quot; project. This, with the winning entry, designed by Will Alsop and known as &quot;the Cloud&quot;, was abandoned in 2004 after &quot;fundamental changes&quot; to the original waterfront plan left it unworkable.

In 2007, work began on a new scheme, to re-house the Museum of Liverpool Life. The new museum, known as the Museum of Liverpool opened in 2011. Work also started in 2007 to build a canal link between the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the South Docks. The £22 million pound, 1.6-mile extension to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was officially opened on 25 March 2009 and opened to boaters at the end of April 2009. It links the of the existing canal to the city&#x27;s South Docks, passing the Pier Head and its landmark buildings.

==Landmark buildings==
The site encompasses a trio of landmarks, built on the site of the former George&#x27;s Dock and referred to since at least 1998 as &quot;The Three Graces&quot;:
*Royal Liver Building, built between 1908 and 1911 and designed by Walter Aubrey Thomas. It is a grade I listed building consisting of two clock towers, both crowned by mythical Liver Birds. The building is the headquarters of the Royal Liver Friendly Society.
*Cunard Building, constructed between 1914 and 1916 and a grade II* listed building. It is the former headquarters of the Cunard Line shipping company.
*Port of Liverpool Building, built from 1903 to 1907 and also grade II* listed. It is the former home of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.
Also on the site is the Grade II listed George&#x27;s Dock Building, to the east of the Port of Liverpool building. It was built in the 1930s and contains offices and ventilator equipment for the Queensway Tunnel.

==Landing stages==
===Trans-Atlantic shipping===
Originally, the Prince&#x27;s Landing Stage was situated at the Pier Head to serve the trans-Atlantic liner service. There were a number of these stages built during Liverpool&#x27;s history, the most recent opened in the 1890s and was joined to the neighbouring George&#x27;s Landing Stage, situated to the south. After further lengthening took place in the early twentieth century, the combined structure originally measured 2,478 feet, almost half a mile. Both were scrapped in 1973, following the termination of trans-Atlantic services from Liverpool.

===Mersey Ferries===
The Mersey Ferries operate from George&#x27;s Landing Stage, owned by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. Ferries travel to Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey.

Only a few months after a new stage (to replace the previous combined structure) was opened on 13 July 1975, it had to be refloated, after sinking in freak weather. Similar conditions, and an extremely low tide on 2 March 2006, caused it to sink again, probably because one of its girder&#x27;s air pockets ruptured, and it could not be refloated. A temporary landing stage was installed until early 2010, when work began on a new Mersey Ferries landing stage. Mersey Ferries services switched to the Cruise Terminal. Services to Liverpool had to be suspended on 14 occasions during the year when large cruise ships were visiting.

A brand new dedicated landing stage for the ferry was towed into place in November 2011, with the linkspan bridge being craned into place shortly after. The new landing stage was officially opened in January 2012, with services resuming on 9 January.

===Isle of Man Ferry===
The Isle of Man Steam Packet ferry service also operates from Princes Landing Stage, at a berth adjacent to those used by the Mersey Ferries.

==Land transport==
In addition to the Mersey Ferries, the Pier Head previously served as a major tram and later bus interchange.

Merseyrail&#x27;s James Street station is a short walk away. The station was formerly part of the Mersey Railway. The Pier Head was also originally served by Liverpool Riverside station, connecting to main line services via the Victoria tunnel, and Pier Head station, on the Liverpool Overhead Railway. Both have since been demolished.

==Open space==
The open space at the Pier Head has also seen several developments. In the 1960s the area was given over to a bus terminal; in 1963 the terminal building for the Mersey Ferry was refurbished to include an adjoining restaurant. In 1991 the ferry terminal itself was reconfigured to its present style.

Running the length of the plaza is the Canada Boulevard, a walkway containing memorial plaques in memory of Canadians who gave their life in the Battle of the Atlantic.

In the centre of the space is an equestrian statue of Edward VII, dating from 1921.

==Memorials==
The space also contains a number of memorials;
Clockwise from the north are:-
*The Titanic Memorial, to the engineers who remained at their posts during the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;,
*the Cunard War Memorial.
*the Memorial of Sir Alfred Lewis Jones
*the Merchant Navy war memorial.

There are several recent additions to the memorials at the Pier Head. In 2013, memorials were unveiled to the Second World War convoy escort group commander Captain Johnnie Walker and to the RMS Lancastria. The Chinese Merchant Seamen&#x27;s Memorial, remembering the Chinese merchant seamen who served and died for Britain in both World Wars, was unveiled on 23 January 2006.

<text>Bernard Francis McGann (22 June 1937 – 17 September 2013) was an Australian jazz alto saxophone player. He began his career in the late 1950s and remained active as a performer, composer and recording artist until near the end of his life. McGann won four ARIA Music Awards between 1993 and 2001.

McGann led the Bernie McGann Trio and Bernie McGann Quartet through his career. The most well-known lineup of the Trio was McGann (alto sax), John Pochee (drums), Lloyd Swanton (bass), with the addition of Warwick Alder (trumpet) in the quartet.

==Career==
Born in Granville, in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs, McGann first came to prominence as part of a loose alliance of modern jazz musicians who performed at the &quot;El Rocco Jazz Cellar&quot; in Kings Cross, Sydney in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He had an enduring collaboration with drummer John Pochee.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, McGann also performed with rock and pop groups and as a session musician, and in the 1970s he was a member of the Sydney rock-soul band &quot;Southern Comfort&quot;. In 1974, McGann was a founding member of jazz group, &quot;The Last Straw&quot;.

Between 1980 and 1982, McGann played support to US jazz artists, including Freddie Hubbard, Lester Bowie, and Dave Liebman.

In 1983, McGann studied in New York on a grant from The Australia Council.

In 1988, McGann Toured Australia and USA with the &quot;Australian Jazz Orchestra&quot;, a special Bicentennial project. He was a featured artist in award-winning documentary film &quot;Beyond El Rocco&quot;.

In 1992, McGann won the Spiral Scratch MO Award for Bernie McGann Trio in Jazz Group of the Year.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993, McGann won the ARIA Award for Best Jazz Album.

In 1994, McGann won Australian Mo Awards for Jazz Instrumentalist of the Year.

In 1998, McGann won the Don Banks Music Award, the first time it has been awarded to a non-classical musician/composer. Launch of biography &quot;Bernie McGann: A Life in Jazz&quot; by Geoff Page (Kardooraire Press).

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, McGann won his fourth ARIA Award.

<doc id="1043027" wikidata="Q4400753" url="?curid=1043027" title="A Russian Journal">
<text>A Russian Journal, published by John Steinbeck in April 1948, is an eyewitness account of his travels through the Soviet Union during the early years of the Cold War era. Accompanied by the distinguished war photographer Robert Capa, Steinbeck set out with the intent to record the real attitudes and modes of existence of people living under Soviet rule. As Steinbeck explained it, the book&#x27;s goal was &quot;honest reporting, to set down what we saw and heard without editorial comment, without drawing conclusions about things we didn&#x27;t know sufficiently.&quot;

This literary and photographic record of life under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule is a historical document. Steinbeck and Capa portray Soviet people as living in extremely different conditions from those in the reports among the West of the day: life in the cities and the country appears peaceful and very similar to that of other peoples in Europe at the time. Without diminishing the authoritarian nature of the Soviet Union, Steinbeck claimed that the main fear held by average Russians was not of Stalin but another World War.

During their short trip to the Soviet Union, Steinbeck and Capa visited Moscow, Kiev, Stalingrad and Soviet Georgia.

During his visit to Kiev, Steinbeck was shocked by the war&#x27;s devastation in Ukraine, and to convey it to Americans, wrote:

If the United States were completely destroyed from New York to Kansas, we would have about the area of destruction the Ukraine has. If six million people were killed, not counting soldiers, fifteen per cent of the population, you would have an idea of the casualties of the Ukraine. Counting soldiers, there would be many more, but six million out of forty-five million civilians have been killed. There are mines which never opened because the Germans threw thousands of bodies down into the shafts.

<doc id="1043035" wikidata="Q7608981" url="?curid=1043035" title="Stephen Cummings">
<text>Stephen Donald Cummings (born 13 September 1954) is an Australian rock singer and songwriter. He was the lead singer of Melbourne-based rock band the Sports from 1976 to 1981, followed by a solo career which has met with critical acclaim but has had limited commercial success. He has written two novels, &quot;Wonderboy&quot; (1996) and &quot;Stay Away from Lightning Girl&quot; (1999), and a memoir, &quot;Will It Be Funny Tomorrow, Billy&quot; (2009). In 2014 a documentary film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot;, based on his memoir premiered as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival.

==Early years==
Stephen Cummings was born in 1954 in Melbourne and grew up in the suburb of Camberwell. He was the vocalist for Ewe and the Merinos.

== Career ==

=== The Pelaco Brothers ===

The Pelaco Brothers formed in 1974, with Cummings on vocals, Joe Camilleri on saxophone and vocals, Peter Lillie on guitar and vocals, Johnny Topper on bass guitar, Karl Wolfe on drums and Chris Worrall on guitar. They played &quot;rock-a-billy, country swing and R&amp;B which recalled American outfits like Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen and Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks. Yet, the band&#x27;s delivery presented a fiercely Australian outlook&quot;. Only existing for 18 months, they later included Ed Bates on guitar and Peter Martin on slide guitar, their posthumous releases were &quot;The Notorious Pelaco Brothers Show&quot; a live six-track Extended Play on the Ralph imprint (a completely different entity from the San Francisco label) in June 1977 and three studio tracks for a various artists release, &quot;The Autodrifters and The Relaxed Mechanics Meet The Fabulous Nudes and The Pelaco Bros&quot;, in June 1978 on Missing Link Records. The Pelaco Brothers disbanded in late 1975. Camilleri went on to form Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons, Lillie formed Relaxed Mechanics and Topper formed the Fabulous Nudes. Lillie, Topper and Wolfe were all in the Autodrifters. Meanwhile, Steve Cummings and Bates formed the Sports in 1976

=== The Sports ===

The Sports were a new wave band formed in 1976 by Cummings and former Pelaco Brothers bandmate Ed Bates, with Robert Glover (former Myriad) on bass guitar, Jim Niven on piano (former the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band) with Paul Hitchins on drums. Their early sets contained covers of Chuck Berry, Billy Emerson, Don Covay, Company Caine and Graham Parker. Original songs, mostly written by Cummings and Bates, completed their sets. The Sports&#x27; debut recording was the EP &quot;Fair Game&quot; in early 1977. A friend in London posted the record to &quot;New Musical Express&quot; which declared it &quot;Record Of The Week&quot;. Andrew Pendlebury (ex-Myriad) joined on guitar in August 1977 and assisted Cummings with songwriting. Cummings brought in Martin Armiger on guitar, vocals and songwriting to replace Bates in August 1978. The Sports had top 30 hits on the Australian Kent Music Report singles charts with &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot; (1979), &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1980) and &quot;How Come&quot; (1981); and top 20 albums with &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot; (#9, 1979), &quot;Suddenly&quot; (No. 13, 1980) and &quot;Sondra&quot; (1981). &quot;Who Listens to the Radio?&quot;, co-written by Cummings and Pendlebury, peaked at No. 35 on the Australian singles charts in 1978, and was their only hit on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart, peaking at No. 45 in November 1979.

=== Solo career ===
After the Sports had disbanded in late 1981, Cummings formed a &quot;part-time&quot; band, A Ring of Truth, with Robert Glover (also the Sports), Peter Luscombe (Tinsley Waterhouse), Wilbur Wilde (Ol &#x27;55, Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons) and Les Stackpool (In-Focus). Stackpool was soon replaced by Peter Laffy (Mondo Rock). According to &quot;Tharunka&quot;″s Diane Livesey, &quot;[they were Cummings] way of relieving boredom for a while and inflicting &#x27;the modern face of cabaret&#x27; upon an unsuspecting public ... The only way to describe them is &#x27;truly wonderful&#x27;.&quot; By late March 1982, Cummings had left that group. He spent the rest of 1982 co-writing tracks with Ian Stephen and waiting out his contract. He released his debut solo single, &quot;We all Make Mistakes&quot; on Phantom Records, in December 1982 and followed with &quot;Stuck on Love&quot; in May 1983. Cummings&#x27; debut album, &quot;Senso&quot;, released by Regular Records in August 1984, was produced by former bandmate Martin Armiger, and recorded with session musicians including Armiger, Joe Camilleri and Pendlebury from his earlier bands. &quot;Senso&quot; spawned two dance-pop singles, &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in July 1984 and &quot;Another Kick in the Head&quot; in October.

His second studio album, &quot;This Wonderful Life&quot;, was released in August 1986. It was a more personal and less busy recording which was produced by Cummings and provided two singles, &quot;Speak with Frankness&quot; and &quot;Love is Crucial&quot;. In September 1987, Cummings dueted with Pendlebury on &quot;She Set Fire to the House&quot;. before releasing his third album, &quot;Lovetown&quot; in January 1988. Cummings formed Stephen Cummings&#x27; Lovetown (aka Stephen Cummings and Lovetown) with Rebecca Barnard on backing vocals, Mick Girasole (also in the Black Sorrows alongside Camilleri) on bass guitar, Peter Luscombe (also the Black Sorrows) on drums, Shane O&#x27;Mara on guitar and Pendlebury on guitar. It &quot;was a very subtle, alluring, personal and mostly acoustic album ... full of conversational, narrative vignettes&quot;. The album, produced by Mark Woods and Cummings, provided two further singles, &quot;Some Prayers Are Answered&quot; in February and &quot;My Willingness&quot; in May.

Cummings changed labels to True Tone Records for his next album, &quot;A New Kind of Blue&quot;, which was released in March 1989 and produced by Cummings and O&#x27;Mara. It spawned three singles, &quot;A Life is a Life&quot; in October 1988, &quot;Your House is Falling&quot; in February 1989 and &quot;When the Day is Done&quot; in July. The album provided Cummings with his only Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Award, winning &quot;Best Adult Contemporary Album&quot; in 1990.

For his fifth solo album, &quot;Good Humour&quot;, Cummings returned to his earlier dance and funk sound from his &quot;Senso&quot; album, using a backing band of Barnard, O&#x27;Mara and Nick Smith (ex-Kevins) on backing vocals, with additional session musicians from Sydney jazz outfit The Necks, and Robert Goodge (I&#x27;m Talking) on guitar, drum programming and co-production (for two tracks). The album, produced by Cummings and O&#x27;Mara, peaked at No. 40 on the ARIA Album Charts in March 1991. &quot;Hell (You&#x27;ve Put Me Through)&quot;, which peaked at No. 33 after its November 1990 release, was followed by a cover of Sly Stone&#x27;s &quot;Family Affair&quot; and then &quot;Stand Up (Love is the Greatest)&quot;. Cummings has supplemented his income by writing advertising jingles: he co-wrote Medibank Private&#x27;s theme &quot;I Feel Better Now&quot;, with Goodge.

Cummings&#x27; sixth studio album, &quot;Unguided Tour&quot;, produced by Cummings and O&#x27;Mara for Polygram Records, was issued in August 1992 and provided three singles. The album peaked at number 76 on the ARIA Charts. In 1993, Cummings&#x27; first compilation album &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; was released.

In August 1994, Cummings&#x27; seventh solo album &quot;Falling Swinger&quot; was released. The single, &quot;September 13&quot; appeared in July and is titled for Cummings&#x27; birthday, which he shares with Steve Kilbey. Later in 1994, the Toni Childs and Cummings duet, &quot;Fell from a Great Height&quot;, was released as a single. It later appeared on Childs&#x27; compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Toni Childs&quot; in 1996.

Steve Kilbey also produced Cummings&#x27; eighth studio album &quot;Escapist&quot;, released in September 1996, which contained &quot;countrified ballad &quot;Everything Breaks Your Heart&quot; to the psychedelic-tinged mantra &quot;Sometimes&quot;. Also in 1996, Cummings published his first novel, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, which deals with relationships especially those between a father and son.

On 14 November 1998, Cummings and, a briefly reformed, The Sports performed at the Mushroom Records 25th anniversary concert. His next solo album, &quot;Spiritual Bum&quot;, had Cummings as record producer and was issued in June 1999. He returned to an acoustic, melancholic sound. Cummings also had his second novel, &quot;Stay Away from Lightning Girl&quot;, published in 1999, which described an ageing musician and his band. In 2001, he released &quot;Skeleton Key&quot; followed by &quot;Firecracker&quot; in 2003, &quot;Close Ups&quot; in 2004, &quot;Love-O-Meter&quot; in 2005, &quot;Space Travel&quot; in 2007, and &quot;Happiest Man Alive&quot; in 2008. On 1 May 2009, his memoir, &quot;Will It Be Funny Tomorrow, Billy&quot; was printed, which his publishers described as a series of anecdotes from his childhood through thirty years of the music business and his family relationships. In October 2010, his 1988 album &quot;Lovetown&quot; was listed in the top 40 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

In 2019, Cummings released his 20th studio album, &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;. A four disc anthology album, titled &quot;A Life is a Life&quot;, was also released in 2019.

In February 2023, Cummings announced the forthcoming release of &quot;100 Years from Now&quot; for 5 May 2023.

== Personal life ==
In March 2020, Cummings had a stroke, but partially recovered and began releasing work in 2023.

<doc id="1043036" wikidata="Q2253746" url="?curid=1043036" title="Bertrand's ballot theorem">
<text>In combinatorics, Bertrand&#x27;s ballot problem is the question: &quot;In an election where candidate A receives &quot;p&quot; votes and candidate B receives &quot;q&quot; votes with &quot;p&quot; &gt; &quot;q&quot;, what is the probability that A will be strictly ahead of B throughout the count under the assumption that votes are counted in a randomly picked order?&quot; The answer is

:formula_1

The result was first published by W. A. Whitworth in 1878, but is named after Joseph Louis François Bertrand who rediscovered it in 1887.

In Bertrand&#x27;s original paper, he sketches a proof based on a general formula for the number of favourable sequences using a recursion relation. He remarks that it seems probable that such a simple result could be proved by a more direct method. Such a proof was given by Désiré André, based on the observation that the unfavourable sequences can be divided into two equally probable cases, one of which (the case where B receives the first vote) is easily computed; he proves the equality by an explicit bijection. A variation of his method is popularly known as André&#x27;s reflection method, although André did not use any reflections.

Bertrand&#x27;s ballot theorem is related to the cycle lemma. They give similar formulas, but the cycle lemma considers circular shifts of a given ballot counting order rather than all permutations.

==Example==
Suppose there are 5 voters, of whom 3 vote for candidate &quot;A&quot; and 2 vote for candidate &quot;B&quot; (so &quot;p&quot; = 3 and &quot;q&quot; = 2). There are ten equally likely orders in which the votes could be counted:
*&quot;AAABB&quot;
*&quot;AABAB&quot;
*&quot;ABAAB&quot;
*&quot;BAAAB&quot;
*&quot;AABBA&quot;
*&quot;ABABA&quot;
*&quot;BAABA&quot;
*&quot;ABBAA&quot;
*&quot;BABAA&quot;
*&quot;BBAAA&quot;
For the order &quot;AABAB&quot;, the tally of the votes as the election progresses is:

For each column the tally for &quot;A&quot; is always larger than the tally for &quot;B&quot;, so &quot;A&quot; is always strictly ahead of &quot;B&quot;. For the order &quot;AABBA&quot; the tally of the votes as the election progresses is:

For this order, &quot;B&quot; is tied with &quot;A&quot; after the fourth vote, so &quot;A&quot; is not always strictly ahead of &quot;B&quot;.
Of the 10 possible orders, &quot;A&quot; is always ahead of &quot;B&quot; only for &quot;AAABB&quot; and &quot;AABAB&quot;. So the probability that &quot;A&quot; will always be strictly ahead is
:formula_2
and this is indeed equal to formula_3 as the theorem predicts.

==Equivalent problems==

===Favourable orders===
Rather than computing the probability that a random vote counting order has the desired property, one can instead compute the number of favourable counting orders, then divide by the total number of ways in which the votes could have been counted. (This is the method that was used by Bertrand.) The total number of ways is the binomial coefficient formula_4; Bertrand&#x27;s proof shows that the number of favourable orders in which to count the votes is formula_5 (though he does not give this number explicitly). And indeed after division this gives formula_6.

===Random walks===
Another related problem is to calculate the number of random walks on the integers that consist of &quot;n&quot; steps of unit length, beginning at the origin and ending at the point &quot;m&quot;, that never become negative. As &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; have the same parity and formula_7, this number is
:formula_8
When formula_9 and formula_10 is even, this gives the Catalan number formula_11. Thus the probability that a random walk is never negative and returns to origin at time formula_10 is formula_13. By Stirling&#x27;s formula, when formula_14, this probability is formula_15.

[Note that formula_16 have the same parity as follows: let formula_17 be the number of &quot;positive&quot; moves, i.e., to the right, and let formula_18 be the number of &quot;negative&quot; moves, i.e., to the left. Since formula_19 and formula_20, we have formula_21 and formula_22. Since formula_17 and formula_18 are integers,formula_16 have the same parity]

==Proof by reflection==
For A to be strictly ahead of B throughout the counting of the votes, there can be no ties. Separate the counting sequences according to the first vote. Any sequence that begins with a vote for B must reach a tie at some point, because A eventually wins. For any sequence that begins with A and reaches a tie, reflect the votes up to the point of the first tie (so any A becomes a B, and vice versa) to obtain a sequence that begins with B. Hence every sequence that begins with A and reaches a tie is in one-to-one correspondence with a sequence that begins with B, and the probability that a sequence begins with B is formula_26, so the probability that A always leads the vote is
:formula_27 the probability of sequences that tie at some point
:formula_27 the probability of sequences that tie at some point and begin with A or B
:formula_29 the probability of sequences that tie at some point and begin with B formula_30
:formula_29 the probability that a sequence begins with B formula_30
:formula_33

==Proof by induction==
Another method of proof is by mathematical induction:
*We loosen the condition formula_34 to formula_35. Clearly, the theorem is correct when formula_36, since in this case the first candidate will not be &quot;strictly&quot; ahead after all the votes have been counted (so the probability is 0).
*Clearly the theorem is true if &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;q&quot; = 0 when the probability is 1, given that the first candidate receives all the votes; it is also true when &quot;p&quot; = &quot;q&quot; &gt; 0 as we have just seen.
*Assume it is true both when &quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot; − 1 and &quot;q&quot; = &quot;b&quot;, and when &quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;q&quot; = &quot;b&quot; − 1, with &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0. (We don&#x27;t need to consider the case formula_37 here, since we have already disposed of it before.) Then considering the case with &quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;q&quot; = &quot;b&quot;, the last vote counted is either for the first candidate with probability &quot;a&quot;/(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;), or for the second with probability &quot;b&quot;/(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;). So the probability of the first being ahead throughout the count to the penultimate vote counted (and also after the final vote) is:
::formula_38
*And so it is true for all &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; with &quot;p&quot; &gt; &quot;q&quot; &gt; 0.

== Proof by the cycle lemma ==

A simple proof is based on the cycle lemma of Dvoretzky and Motzkin.
Call a ballot sequence &quot;dominating&quot; if A is strictly ahead of B throughout the counting of the votes. The cycle lemma asserts that any sequence of formula_39 A&#x27;s and formula_40 B&#x27;s, where formula_41, has precisely formula_42 dominating cyclic permutations. To see this, just arrange the given sequence of formula_43 A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s in a circle and repeatedly remove adjacent pairs AB until only formula_42 A&#x27;s remain. Each of these A&#x27;s was the start of a dominating cyclic permutation before anything was removed. So formula_42 out of the formula_43 cyclic permutations of any arrangement of formula_39 A votes and formula_40 B votes are dominating.

== Proof by martingales ==

Let formula_49. Define the &quot;backwards counting&quot; stochastic process

formula_50
where formula_51 is the lead of candidate A over B, after formula_52 votes have come in.

Claim: formula_53 is a martingale process. Given formula_53, we know that formula_55, so of the first formula_52 votes, formula_57 were for candidate A, and formula_58 were for candidate B. So, with probability formula_59, we have formula_60, and formula_61. Similarly for the other one. Then compute to find formula_62. Define the stopping time formula_63 as either the minimum formula_64 such that formula_65, or formula_66 if there&#x27;s no such formula_64. Then the probability that candidate A leads all the time is just formula_68, which by the optional stopping theorem is formula_69

==Bertrand&#x27;s and André&#x27;s proofs==
Bertrand expressed the solution as
:formula_70
where formula_71 is the total number of voters and formula_72 is the number of voters for the first candidate. He states that the result follows from the formula
:formula_73
where formula_74 is the number of favourable sequences, but &quot;it seems probable that such a simple result could be shown in a more direct way&quot;. Indeed, a more direct proof was soon produced by Désiré André. His approach is often mistakenly labelled &quot;the reflection principle&quot; by modern authors but in fact uses a permutation. He shows that the &quot;unfavourable&quot; sequences (those that reach an intermediate tie) consist of an equal number of sequences that begin with A as those that begin with B. Every sequence that begins with B is unfavourable, and there are formula_75 such sequences with a B followed by an arbitrary sequence of (&quot;q&quot;-1) B&#x27;s and &quot;p&quot; A&#x27;s. Each unfavourable sequence that begins with A can be transformed to an arbitrary sequence of (&quot;q&quot;-1) B&#x27;s and &quot;p&quot; A&#x27;s by finding the first B that violates the rule (by causing the vote counts to tie) and deleting it, and interchanging the order of the remaining parts. To reverse the process, take any sequence of (&quot;q&quot;-1) B&#x27;s and &quot;p&quot; A&#x27;s and search from the end to find where the number of A&#x27;s first exceeds the number of B&#x27;s, and then interchange the order of the parts and place a B in between. For example, the unfavourable sequence AABBABAA corresponds uniquely to the arbitrary sequence ABAAAAB. From this, it follows that the number of favourable sequences of &quot;p&quot; A&#x27;s and &quot;q&quot; B&#x27;s is
:formula_76
and thus the required probability is
:formula_77
as expected.

==Variant: ties allowed==

The original problem is to find the probability that the first candidate is always strictly ahead in the vote count. One may instead consider the problem of finding the probability that the second candidate is never ahead (that is, with ties are allowed). In this case, the answer is
:formula_78
The variant problem can be solved by the reflection method in a similar way to the original problem. The number of possible vote sequences is formula_79. Call a sequence &quot;bad&quot; if the second candidate is ever ahead, and if the number of bad sequences can be enumerated then the number of &quot;good&quot; sequences can be found by subtraction and the probability can be computed.

Represent a voting sequence as a lattice path on the Cartesian plane as follows:
* Start the path at (0, 0)
* Each time a vote for the first candidate is received move right 1 unit.
* Each time a vote for the second candidate is received move up 1 unit.
Each such path corresponds to a unique sequence of votes and will end at (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;). A sequence is &#x27;good&#x27; exactly when the corresponding path never goes above the diagonal line &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;; equivalently, a sequence is &#x27;bad&#x27; exactly when the corresponding path touches the line &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + 1.

For each &#x27;bad&#x27; path &quot;P&quot;, define a new path &quot;P&quot;′ by reflecting the part of &quot;P&quot; up to the first point it touches the line across it. &quot;P&quot;′ is a path from (−1, 1) to (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;). The same operation applied again restores the original &quot;P&quot;. This produces a one-to-one correspondence between the &#x27;bad&#x27; paths and the paths from (−1, 1) to (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;). The number of these paths is formula_80 and so that is the number of &#x27;bad&#x27; sequences. This leaves the number of &#x27;good&#x27; sequences as
:formula_81
Since there are formula_79 altogether, the probability of a sequence being good is formula_83.

In fact, the solutions to the original problem and the variant problem are easily related. For candidate A to be strictly ahead throughout the vote count, they must receive the first vote and for the remaining votes (ignoring the first) they must be either strictly ahead or tied throughout the count. Hence the solution to the original problem is
:formula_84
as required.

Conversely, the tie case can be derived from the non-tie case. Note that the &quot;number&quot; of non-tie sequences with p+1 votes for A is equal to the number of tie sequences with p votes for A. The number of non-tie votes with p + 1 votes for A votes is formula_85, which by algebraic manipulation is formula_86, so the &quot;fraction&quot; of sequences with p votes for A votes is formula_87.

<text>Seacliff State Beach is a state beach park on Monterey Bay, in the town of Aptos, Santa Cruz County, California. It is located off Highway 1 on State Park Drive, about 5 miles (8 km) south of Santa Cruz. The beach is most known for the concrete ship SS &quot;Palo Alto&quot; lying in the water. North of Seacliff State Beach is New Brighton State Beach.

==History==
The beach was originally home to the Ohlone people. Spanish missionaries established the Mission Santa Cruz about eight miles west of here.

In 1821, when Mexico gained independence from Spain, the area was divided up into land grants. The area of the beach was a part of the Rancho Aptos grant to Rafael Castro in 1833. Castro worked with Claus Spreckels to establish the Castro-Spreckels wharf. The beach soon became a successful shipping port. The logging industry also thrived here with the local coast redwood trees.

The port facilitated major trade with the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1838, King Kamehameha III requested that Mexican vaqueros from California travel to Hawaii to teach Hawaiians how to manage herds of wild cattle. Seacliff became a popular place to recruit vaqueros, who were known as paniolos by the Hawaiians.

In the 1850s, Thomas Fallon acquired part of the beach and turned it into a resort, which he named &quot;New Brighton&quot;, in honor of his favorite seaside resort in England.

In the 1920s, after Claus Spreckels&#x27; death, sections of the beach were developed into the Seacliff Park and the Rio Del Mar Country Club.

In 1930, the first California state grant for preserving land was granted for the beach and, in 1931, it became a state beach.

===SS &quot;Palo Alto&quot;===
The beach&#x27;s most notable feature is the World War I concrete ship SS &quot;Palo Alto&quot; formerly lying at the end of a wooden pier. The unfinished ship was hauled to Seacliff Beach in 1930 by the Cal-Nevada Company, beached, and turned into an amusement center, complete with a ballroom, a cafe, a 4-foot heated pool, and carnival booths. The company went bankrupt after two seasons and the ship was stripped. It is now permanently closed to the public. In the 2016–2017 storm season, a section of the ship overturned, and the pier was damaged. During the 2022–2023 storms, the ship was further broken down and the pier was extensively damaged, with the part closest to the ship being destroyed. Demolition of the pier began on March 20, 2023 and has since been completed.

==Animal and plant life==
The beach is home to many types of birds and marine life, including mussels, ocean worms, sea stars, sea anemones, barnacles, rock crabs, harbor seals, anglers, flounder, mackerel, halibut, lingcod, perch, cabezon, jacksmelt, steelhead, anchovy, bocaccio (tomcod), kingfish, dark seabirds, sea lions, dolphins, sea otters, whales, and great white sharks. The Palo Alto serves as a main place for marine life.

==Recreation==
Seacliff includes RV facilities, picnic tables, and fire pits.
It is also a popular place for surfing and fishing.

<doc id="1043047" wikidata="Q329967" url="?curid=1043047" title="Paestum">
<text>Paestum ( , , ) was a major ancient Greek city on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea, in Magna Graecia. The ruins of Paestum are famous for their three ancient Greek temples in the Doric order dating from about 550 to 450 BCE that are in an excellent state of preservation. The city walls and amphitheatre are largely intact, and the bottom of the walls of many other structures remain, as well as paved roads. The site is open to the public, and there is a modern national museum within it, which also contains the finds from the associated Greek site of Foce del Sele.

Paestum was established around 600 BCE by settlers from Sybaris, a Greek colony in southern Italy, under the name of Poseidonia (). The city thrived as a Greek settlement for about two centuries, witnessing the development of democracy. In 400 BCE, the Lucanians seized the city. Romans took over in 273 BCE, renaming it Paestum and establishing a Latin colony. Later, its decline ensued from shifts in trade routes and the onset of flooding and marsh formation. As Pesto or Paestum, the town became a bishopric (now only titular), but it was abandoned in the Early Middle Ages, and left undisturbed and largely forgotten until the eighteenth century.

Today the remains of the city are found in the modern &quot;frazione&quot; of Paestum, which is part of the &quot;comune&quot; of Capaccio Paestum in the Province of Salerno in the region of Campania, Italy. The modern settlement, directly to the south of the archaeological site, is a popular seaside resort with long sandy beaches. The Paestum railway station on the Naples-Salerno-Reggio Calabria railway line is directly to the east of the ancient city walls. 

== Name ==
The Greek settlers who founded the city originally named it Poseidonia (). It was eventually conquered by the local Lucanians and later the Romans. The Lucanians renamed it to Paistos and the Romans gave the city its current name. 

== Ancient ruins and features==
Much of the most celebrated features of the site today are the three large temples in the Archaic version of the Greek Doric order, dating from about 550 to 450 BCE. All are typical of the period, with massive colonnades having a very pronounced entasis (widening as they go down), and very wide capitals resembling upturned mushrooms. Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place.

These were dedicated to Hera and Athena (Juno and Minerva to the Romans), although previously they often have been identified otherwise, following eighteenth-century arguments. The two temples of Hera are right next to each other, while the Temple of Athena is on the other side of the town center. There were other temples, both Greek and Roman, which are far less well preserved. 

Paestum is far from any sources of good marble. Unsurprisingly, the three main temples had few stone reliefs, perhaps using painting instead. Painted terracotta was used for some detailed parts of the structure. The large pieces of terracotta that have survived are in the museum.
The whole ancient city of Paestum covered an area of approximately 120 hectares. Only the 25 hectares that contain the three main temples and the other main buildings have been excavated. The other 95 hectares remain on private land and have not been studied.

The ancient city was surrounded by defensive walls, which are largely intact. The walls are approximately long in its polygonal perimeter, typically high, and thick. Corresponding with the cardinal points, there were four main openings in the wall: Porta Sirena (east to the hills); Porta Giustizia (south, now to the modern village Paestum); Porta Marina (west to the sea); and Porta Aurea (north), which was later destroyed. Positioned along the wall were 24 square or round towers. There may have been as many as 28, but some of them (and Porta Aurea) were destroyed during the construction of a highway during the 18th century that effectively cut the ancient site in two. 

The central area is completely clear of modern buildings and always has been largely so, since the Middle Ages. Although much stone has been stripped from the site, large numbers of buildings remain detectable by their footings or the lower parts of their walls, and the main roads remain paved. A low-built heroon or shrine memorial to an unknown local hero survived intact; the contents are in the museum. Numerous tombs have been excavated outside the walls.

=== The three Greek Temples ===


The first Temple of Hera, built around 550 BCE by the Greek colonists, is the oldest surviving temple in Paestum and the one farthest south. 18th-century archaeologists named it &quot;the Basilica&quot; because some mistakenly believed it to be a Roman building. (The original Roman basilica was essentially a civic form of building, before the basilica plan was adopted by the Early Christians for churches.) 

Inscriptions and terracotta statuettes revealed that the goddess worshiped here was Hera. Later, an altar was unearthed in front of the temple, in the open-air site usual for a Greek altar. The faithful could attend rites and sacrifices without entering the &quot;cella&quot; or inner sanctuary.

The columns have a very strong entasis or curvature down their length, an indication of an early date of construction. Some of the capitals still retain visible traces of their original paint. The temple is wider than most Greek temples, probably because there are two doors and a row of seven columns running centrally inside the cella, an unusual feature. This may reflect a dual dedication of the temple. Having an odd number of columns, here nine, across the shorter sides also is very unusual; there are eighteen columns along the longer sides. This was possible, or necessary, because of the two doors, so that neither has a view blocked by a column. 
On the highest point of the town, some way from the Hera Temples and north of the center of the ancient settlement, is the Temple of Athena. It was built around 500 BCE, and was for some time incorrectly thought to have been dedicated to Ceres. The architecture is transitional, being mainly built in early Doric style and partially Ionic. Three medieval Christian tombs in the floor show that the temple was at one time used as a Christian church.

The second Temple of Hera was built around 460–450 BCE, just north of the first Hera Temple, the two both part of a &quot;Heraion&quot;, or sanctuary to the goddess. It was once thought to be dedicated to Poseidon, who may have been a secondary focus of worship there. Instead of the typical 20 flutes on each column, they have 24 flutes. The Temple of Hera II also has a wider column size and smaller intervals between columns. The temple was also used to worship Zeus and another deity, whose identity is unknown. There are visible on the east side the remains of two altars, one large and one smaller. The smaller one is a Roman addition, built when a road leading to a Roman forum was cut through the larger one. It also is possible that the temple originally was dedicated to both Hera and Poseidon; some offertory statues found around the larger altar are thought to demonstrate this identification.

===Other archaeological features===
In the central part of the complex is the Roman Forum, thought to have been built on the site of the preceding Greek agora. On the north side of the forum is a small Roman temple, dated to 200 BCE. It was dedicated to the Capitoline Triad, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva.

Between the forum and the temples of Hera and Poseidon, six small temple buildings from the Hellenistic period have been identified.

To the north-east of the forum is the amphitheater. This is of normal Roman pattern, although much smaller than later examples. Only the western half is visible; in 1930 CE, a road was built across the site, burying the eastern half. It is said by local inhabitants that the civil engineer responsible was tried, convicted and received a prison sentence for what was described as wanton destruction of a historic site. There is also a small circular council hall (&quot;bouleuterion&quot;) or assembly space (&quot;ekklesiasterion&quot;), with seats in tiers. It was probably never roofed, but had a wall around it, perhaps with a small arcade round the inside. This ceased to have a role in Roman times and was filled over.

The heroön, close to the forum and the Temple of Athena, probably celebrated the founder of the city, though constructed around a century after the death of this unnamed figure. It was a low tumulus with a walled rectangular enclosure faced with large stones around it. When it was excavated in 1954 a low stone chamber with a pitched roof was discovered at the centre, half below the surrounding ground level and half above. This contained several large, rare, and splendid bronze vessels, perhaps not locally-made, and a large Athenian pottery black-figure amphora of about 520–500 BCE. The bronze vessels had traces of honey inside. These are all now in the museum.

Just south of the city walls, at a site still called Santa Venera, a series of small terracotta offertory molded statuettes of a standing nude woman wearing the &quot;polos&quot; headdress of Anatolian and Syrian goddesses, which were dated to the first half of the sixth century BCE, were found in the sanctuary. Other similar ones have been excavated at other Paestum sanctuaries during excavations in the 1980s. The figure is highly unusual in the Western Mediterranean. The open-air &quot;temenos&quot; was established at the start of Greek occupation: a temple on the site was not built until the early fifth century BCE. A nude goddess is a figure alien to Greek culture before the famous Cnidian Aphrodite by Praxiteles in the fourth century: iconographic analogies must be sought in Phoenician Astarte and the Cypriote Aphrodite. &quot;In places where the Greeks and Phoenicians came in contact with one another, there is often an overlapping in the persona of the two deities.&quot;

Inscriptions make clear that during Roman times the cult was reserved to Venus.

=== Painted tombs ===



Paestum also is renowned for its painted tombs, mainly belonging to the Lucanian period, while only one of them dates to the Greek period. However, this is the Tomb of the Diver (Italian: &quot;Tomba del tuffatore&quot;), which is the most famous. It is named after the enigmatic scene, depicted on the underside of the covering slab, of a young man diving into a stream of water. It dates to the first half of the fifth century BCE (about 470 BCE), the Golden Age of the Greek town. It was found, on 3 June 1968, in a small necropolis some 1.5 km south of the ancient walls. The paintings have now been transferred to the museum. The tomb is painted with the &quot;true fresco&quot; technique and its importance lies in being &quot;the only example of Greek painting with figured scenes dating from the Orientalizing, Archaic, or Classical periods to survive in its entirety. Among the thousands of Greek tombs known from this time (roughly 700–400 BCE), this is the only one found to have been decorated with frescoes of human subjects.&quot;

The remaining four walls of the tomb are occupied by symposium-related scenes, an iconography far more familiar from Greek pottery than the diving scene. All the five frescoes are displayed in the museum, together with other cycles from Lucanian painted tombs. In contrast to earlier Greek tomb paintings, these later scenes have many figures and a high proportion of scenes including horses and equestrian sports.


===Sele complex=== 
A few kilometres from Paestum there was a temple complex at the mouth of the Sele river (&quot;Foce del Sele&quot; in Italian) dedicated to Hera. The temple is now all but destroyed, and little remains of several other buildings. About 70 of the sixth-century BCE Archaic metope relief panels on the temple and another building at the site were recovered, however. These fall into two groups, the earlier of which shows the story of the life of Heracles in 38 surviving reliefs; the later group, of about 510 BCE, shows pairs of running women. The earlier cycle forms the centrepiece of the Paestum museum, set in place around walls of the original height. At the site there is a &quot;museo narrante&quot; with video displays, but no original artefacts.

===Art from Paestum===

The National Archaeological Museum of Paestum holds the largest collection, but many significant pieces were removed from the site before modern controls and are in a number of collections around the world. The National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid has especially rich holdings, with two important Imperial Roman statues and many, very fine vases (see below). Other pieces, mostly painted pottery, are in the Louvre, the Antikensammlung Berlin, and other museums in Europe and America.

In the case of painted pottery, a number of individual artists, especially from the fourth century BCE, have been identified and given notnames whose work has been found in tombs around the city and the region, and sometimes farther afield. It has been presumed that these artists were based in the city.

===National Archaeological Museum ===
The highlights of the National Archaeological Museum of Paestum are mentioned above: the Sele metopes, the Tomb of the Diver, and the contents of the Heroon. The displays also show a number of large painted terracotta architectural fragments from the temples and other buildings, many Greek terracotta figurines, and incomplete larger terracotta statues, and pottery including painted vases.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
According to Strabo, the city was founded as Poseidonia (named after the Greek deity of the sea) by Greek Achaeans from Sybaris. The colonists had built fortifications close to the sea, but then decided to found the city farther inland at a higher elevation. Solinus wrote that it was established by Dorians. The fortifications might have been built to the south of Poseidonia on the promontory where Agropoli is now. According to the historical tradition the sanctuary to Poseidon was located there, after which the city would have been named. The date of Poseidonia&#x27;s founding is not given by ancient sources, but the archaeological evidence gives a date of approximately 600 BCE.

Alternatively in fact, the Sybarites may have been Troezenians. Aristotle wrote that a group of Troezenians was expelled from Sybaris by the Achaeans after their joint founding of that city. Gaius Julius Solinus calls Paestum a Dorian colony and Strabo mentions that Troezen once was called Poseidonia. As a consequence it has been argued that Paestum was founded by the Troezenians referred to by Aristotle. Another hypothesis is that the Sybarites were aided by Dorians in their founding of Poseidonia.

=== Greek period ===
Archaeological evidence from Paestum&#x27;s first centuries indicates the building of roads, temples, and other features of a growing city. Coinage, architecture, and molded votive figurines all attest to close relations maintained with Metaponto in the sixth and fifth centuries.

It is presumed that Poseidonia harbored refugees from its mother city, Sybaris, when that city was conquered by Croton in 510 BCE. In the early fifth century, Poseidonia&#x27;s coins adopted the Achaean weight standard and the bull seen on Sybarite coins. A. J. Graham thinks it was plausible that the number of refugees was large enough for some kind of synoecism to have occurred between the Poseidonians and the Sybarites, possibly in the form of a sympolity.

Poseidonia might have had a major share in a new foundation of Sybaris, which lasted from 452/1 BCE until 446/5 BCE. This is suggested by the great resemblance of the coins of Sybaris to those of Poseidonia during this period. Possibly a treaty of friendship between Sybaris, its allies, and the Serdaioi (an unknown people) dates to this new foundation, because Poseidonia was the guarantor of this treaty.

=== Lucanian period === 
It is not until the end of the fifth century BCE that the city is mentioned, when according to Strabo, the city was conquered by the Lucanians. From the archaeological evidence it appears that the two cultures, Greek and Oscan, were able to thrive alongside one another.

Many tomb paintings show horses and horse-racing, a passion of the Lucanian elites.

=== Roman period and abandonment ===
It became the Roman city of Paestum in 273 BCE in the aftermath of the Pyrrhic War, in which the Graeco-Italian Poseidonians sided with king Pyrrhus of Epirus against the Roman Republic.

During the Carthaginian invasion of Italy by Hannibal, the city remained faithful to Rome and afterward, was granted special favours such as the minting of its own coinage. The city continued to prosper during the Roman imperial period and became a bishopric as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pesto around 400 CE.

By the time of Virgil the city was &quot;known for roses that bloomed twice a year&quot;, as he mentions in Book IV of his &quot;Georgics&quot; (c. 29 BCE). Then highly unusual, this is now a common feature of modern cultivars of garden roses. 
It started to go into decline between the fourth and seventh centuries CE, and was abandoned during the Middle Ages. The bishopric was suppressed in 1100. Like Naples and most of the surrounding region, the inhabitants presumably spoke a Greek dialect throughout its history. The decline and desertion were probably due to changes in local land drainage patterns, leading to swampy malarial conditions. Raids by &quot;Saracen&quot; pirates and slavers also may have been a deciding factor. The remaining population seems to have moved to the more easily defended cliff-top settlement at Agropoli (i.e. &quot;acropolis&quot; or &quot;citadel&quot; in Greek), a few kilometres away, although this settlement became a base for Muslim raiders for a period. The Paestum site became overgrown and largely forgotten, although some stone &quot;spolia&quot; were collected and used in Salerno Cathedral by Robert Guiscard (d. 1085).

==Rediscovery==


Despite stray mentions such as that in the history of Pietro Summonte in 1524, who correctly identified the three Doric temples as such, its ruins only came to wide notice again in the eighteenth century, following the rediscovery of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and during the construction of a new coastal road south from Naples. The modern settlement had begun to revive by at least the sixteenth century, to the side of the ancient ruins. After a complicated start, the rediscovery of the three relatively easily accessible, and early, Greek temples created huge interest throughout Europe. 

Giovanni Battista Piranesi visited to make a book of highly atmospheric but also accurate etchings, published in 1778; these and other prints were widely circulated. The complete and relatively simple form of the temples became influential in early Greek Revival architecture.

In 1740 a proposal was made, but not executed, to remove columns for the new Palace of Capodimonte in Naples. Initially, eighteenth-century savants doubted that the structures had been temples, and it was suggested variously, that they included a gymnasium, a public basilica or hall, or a &quot;portico&quot;. There also was controversy and misunderstanding of their cultural background. Alessio Simmaco Mazzocchi, a clergyman and antiquarian, &quot;the founder of the modern study of Magna Graecia&quot; (the ancient Greeks in Italy), thought they were Etruscan, in line with his theories that Greek colonists merely had joined existing cultures in Italy, founded by peoples from farther east. He derived the etymology of &quot;Poseidonia&quot; from an invented Phoenician sea deity.

The first modern published account of the ruins was &quot;Les Ruines de Paestum&quot; in 1764, by G. P. M. Dumont, who had been taken to the site in 1750, along with the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot, by Count Gazzola, an engineer for the government in Naples. Gazzola had drawn or commissioned measured drawings, to which Dumont added his own, as well as, more artistic plates. There was an expanded edition in 1769, the same year when a still more extensive account was published by the Englishman Thomas Major. By 1774 there were nine different illustrated publications on the site.

=== Second World War ===
On September 9, 1943, Paestum was the location of the landing beaches of the U.S. 36th Infantry Division during the Allied invasion of Italy. German forces resisted the landings from the outset, causing heavy fighting within and around the town. Combat persisted around the town for nine days before the Germans withdrew to the north. The Allied forces set up their Red Cross first aid tents in and around the temples, as they were regarded as &quot;off limits&quot; to bombing by both sides.

=== Recent developments ===
In 2024, the Italian Ministry of Culture announced that two Doric style temples were uncovered at Paestum.

==Coins==
The coins of Paestum date from about 550 BCE. These early issues may all be festival coins; they usually depict Poseidon with an upraised trident. Issues continue until the reign of Tiberius. For unknown reasons Paestum alone—of all the smaller Italian mints—was allowed to continue minting bronze coins by a Senatorial decree of about 89 BCE, after minting had been centralized. Later coins carry &quot;P. S. S. C.&quot;, standing for &quot;Paesti Signatum Senatus Consulto&quot; to reflect this.
== In fiction ==
* In his partially fictionalized travelogue, The Innocents Abroad (1869), Mark Twain includes Paestum in the itinerary in Chapter 1 of the &quot;great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land.&quot; The itinerary includes: &quot;Rome [by rail], Herculaneum, Pompeii, Vesuvius, Vergil’s tomb, and possibly the ruins of Paestum can be visited...&quot;
* In the novel &quot;My Ántonia&quot; (1918) by Willa Cather, the professor Gaston Cleric contracts a fever after spending the night outdoors admiring &quot;the sea temples at Paestum&quot;.
* In the film &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (1926) by Rex Ingram, they visit Paestum.
* &quot;Gate to the Sea&quot;, a historical novel by Bryher published in 1958, portrays the flight of Harmonia, a Greek high priestess, from Poseidonia (Paestum), where the Greek inhabitants have been enslaved and culturally dominated by the Lucani since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE.
* Scenes in the 1963 film &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963) were filmed here – notably when the Argonauts assist King Phineus (Patrick Troughton), who has been blinded and is tormented by harpies for his transgressions against the gods. In return for his advice on how to reach Colchis, the Argonauts render the harpies harmless by caging them.
* Scenes in the 1969 film &quot;Goodbye Mr Chips&quot; with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Petula Clark. The musical song’s last line is accompanied by that soaring ‘copter shot of the Temple of Neptune.
* Scenes in the 1981 film &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (where Perseus fights and kills Medusa&#x27;s guardian, a two-headed dog) take place in Paestum.
* In the 2007 video game &quot;Medal of Honor: Airborne&quot;, the second mission set during Operation Avalanche takes place in Paestum.

<text>Drunk Enough to Dance is the fourth studio album and second major label album by American rock band Bowling for Soup. It was recorded from 2001 to 2002 at Tree Sound Studios and Sonica Recording in Atlanta and Big Time Audio in Dallas.

==Production and recording==
After a UK, Canada and midwest U.S. tour to promote their album &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It for Johnny!&quot;, the band ventured out to film the new Britney Spears film &quot;Crossroads&quot;. After filming, they would head to Atlanta in October 2001 to record their next new album. 
The album was produced by Butch Walker, formerly of Marvelous 3.
In a newsletter from the band on January 9, 2002, Reddick said they &quot;recorded 14 songs and that the album would contain a bonus track &quot;Greatest Day&quot;... and hopefully a song or two that Butch and I write next month... the import will have three more song that we did here in Dallas last month.&quot;

==Release==
It was released August 6, 2002 through Jive Records. The single, &quot;Girl All the Bad Guys Want,&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2003 in the &quot;Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal&quot; category. 
A re-release in 2003 added: &quot;Punk Rock 101&quot;; a cover of 1980s new wave band A Flock of Seagulls&#x27; &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot;; and &quot;Star Song&quot;. There is an acoustic version of the song &quot;Belgium&quot; at the very end of the album.

&quot;Punk Rock 101&quot; was released as a radio single on May 20, 2003. Between late June and early August, the group appeared on the Warped Tour. The album is certified Silver in the U.K., having sold over 60,000 copies.

==Reception==

The album was included in &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 101 Modern Classics list at number 63. The album was included at number 32 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list. BuzzFeed included the album at number 28 on their &quot;36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die&quot; list. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;Girl All the Bad Guys Want&quot; at number 61 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs.

==Track listing==
Each version of the album has a number tracks that are five-to-six seconds of complete silence, titled &quot;[Blank],&quot; between the last song and &quot;Belgium.&quot; The number of blank tracks varies upon the version, but &quot;Belgium&quot; is track 28 on all versions except for the Japanese Edition, where it is on track 20 after &quot;Other Girls&quot;. There is about 1 minute of silence in between both songs.

<text>The Port of Liverpool Building (formerly Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Offices, more commonly known as the Dock Office) is a Grade II* listed building in Liverpool, England. It is located at the Pier Head and, along with the neighbouring Royal Liver Building and Cunard Building, is one of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Three Graces,&quot; which line the city&#x27;s waterfront. It is also part of Liverpool&#x27;s formerly UNESCO-designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City.

The building was designed by Sir Arnold Thornely and F.B. Hobbs and was developed in collaboration with Briggs and Wolstenholme. It was constructed between 1904 and 1907, with a reinforced concrete frame that is clad in Portland stone. The building was the headquarters of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) for 87 years, from 1907 to 1994, when the company relocated to new premises at Seaforth Dock. In 2001 it was sold to Downing, a Liverpool-based property developer, and between 2006 and 2009 underwent a major £10m restoration that restored many original features of the building.

The Port of Liverpool Building is in the Edwardian Baroque style and is noted for the large dome that sits atop it, acting as the focal point of the building. It is approximately rectangular in shape with canted corners that are topped with stone cupolas. At the building was the tallest building in Liverpool when built, and as of 2022 is the fourteenth tallest. Like the neighbouring Cunard Building, it is noted for the ornamental detail both on the inside and out, and in particular for the many maritime references and expensive decorative furnishings.

==History==
In 1898 the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) decided to close down and infill George&#x27;s Dock, which was located on the site of what is the Pier Head today. The land was sold to the Liverpool Corporation in 1900, although the MDHB opted to keep the southern section so that they could build a new central headquarters for the company, having been previously located at various sites around the city, including the Old Customs House.

In 1900 a committee was formed by the MDHB to plan and develop a new building for the company. Under the leadership of Robert Gladstone, a competition was launched for local architects to submit designs for the new building. Alfred Waterhouse, a renowned local architect, was brought in to help judge the competition and prizes of £300, £200 and £100 were offered for the three best designs. In total, seven entries were submitted, with the winning design being that of the architects Sir Arnold Thornely and F.B. Hobbs, which had been developed in collaboration with Briggs and Wolstenholme. Due to boundary changes of the land on which the building was to be built, amendments were made to the design, most notably with the central dome, which was only added at the last minute.

In 1903, with the design now confirmed, the MDHB requested that a number of builders submit a tender document for the construction of the building to the revised design. Over 30 builders were contacted, with William Brown &amp; Son of Manchester winning the contract to construct the new building. Work began in 1904, with the first nine months of construction focusing on laying the building&#x27;s foundations, which were dug to a depth of below ground level. The building&#x27;s frame was built from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland stone, a design that meant the building was more fire resistant than with other structural forms. It was completed in 1907 at a cost of approximately £250,000, although when the cost of furniture, fittings and professional fees was taken into account, the total cost was nearer £350,000. Staff from the MDHB headquarters officially moved into the building on 15 July 1907, with staff from departments located in other areas of the city moving in throughout the rest of the year.

During World War II, Liverpool&#x27;s importance as a major port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, on the eastern side of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless, the building&#x27;s structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.

The building acted as the head offices of the MDHB (renamed the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company in 1972) for some 87 years. In 1994 the company moved to new headquarters at the Maritime Centre near Seaforth Dock in the north of the city, in order to be closer to what was now the centre of Liverpool&#x27;s docking system. However, the company remained the owners of the building until 2001 when it was acquired by Downing, a Liverpool-based property developer.

Plans submitted in 2005 for the restoration of the building were approved by Liverpool City Council. The scheme involved major internal and external work that would fully restore the Grade II* listed building. The plans included opening the building to the public, by creating a new viewing floor inside the dome and a publicly accessible sunken piazza on the riverside frontage that would provide a small parade of restaurants, cafes and shops. A sixth level of the building, which had been &quot;dismantled&quot; in the aftermath of the Second World War, was also to be restored, providing a series of luxury apartments. The first stage of the renovation was completed in early 2008, when the restoration of the Portland stone on the river facing side of the building was completed. The £10m restoration project was fully completed in early 2009, when the last scaffolding was removed from the outside of the building and of refurbished office space was completed.

==Architectural design==

The Port of Liverpool Building is the oldest of the three large Pier Head buildings and the architectural features were designed to be reflective of Liverpool&#x27;s importance to the maintenance of the British Empire. However, the building that exists today is actually a modified version of the originally chosen design. Initially, the plan had called for the main entrance of the building to be located on the south-west corner, but boundary changes to land on which it was to be built meant that the design was significantly revised to give it the symmetrical look it has today. Notably, the initial design did not include the large dome that sits so prominently above the building today. Inspired by an unused design for Liverpool&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral, which had been developed several years earlier, the architects added the dome to the design in order to give the building a more imposing look. This decision, however, was not without controversy, as many board members believed that it was not part of the Port Authority&#x27;s duty to &quot;beautify the town&quot;. Nonetheless, it was added to the design, becoming the focal point of the building itself.

Designed in Edwardian Baroque style, the Port of Liverpool Building&#x27;s structural form has been likened to those of Renaissance palaces. Approximately in size, the building rises to in height, making it the fourteenth tallest building in the city. Covering five floors, the main body of the building is 80 ft tall to the cornice. The main entrance is located in the centre of the river-facing side of the building and is flanked by two three-metre-high stone statues of women representing &quot;Commerce&quot; and &quot;Industry&quot;, which were designed by Charles John Allen. Each corner of the building is canted and has a tall hexagonal turret that is topped by a stone cupola, which would have originally been crowned by a lantern. Because the building has a large central dome, it has been compared architecturally to many other buildings throughout the world, including Belfast City Hall, the Capitol Building, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.
The Port of Liverpool Building was constructed using a reinforced concrete frame, which not only made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As a result of being built on the site of the former George&#x27;s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of concrete were used. Due to the building&#x27;s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.

Internally, the building&#x27;s form centres on a full-height, octagonal hall that sits below the central dome. The hall has round, arched openings from the first floor upwards, providing large gallery spaces, whilst its floor is decorated with a mosaic depicting the points of a compass. Office spaces are located off long central corridors, which are decorated with white Calacatta Marble. A large portion of the building costs (approximately 25%) were spent on decorations and fittings; the inside of the building is lavishly decorated using expensive materials including mahogany from Spain and oak from Gdańsk ( Danzig ) for the woodwork, bronze for the floor furniture and fittings, and white marble for the floors and walls. One noted interior feature is the grey granite grand staircase, which is lined with stained glass windows adorned with images of Poseidon, anchors, ships bells and shells and dedications to countries of the British Empire including Singapore, South Africa, Canada and Australia. The grand nature of the inside of the building&#x27;s interior has meant that it has been used as a film set in several productions, including &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. episode &quot;The Blue Carbuncle&quot;

Throughout the building, there are numerous references to the sea and the maritime operations of both Liverpool and the British Empire. The main entrance gates are decorated with a globe supported by dolphins, while the cast iron gates and gate piers are decorated with mermaids, shells and anchors, and have shields with the initials &quot;M.D. &amp; H.B.&quot; (Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Board).

The outside light fittings are designed such that the lights themselves appear to be held in the hands of the Roman God Neptune. Similarly, the lifts are also decorated with maritime references, in the form of gilded emblems representing the globe, seahorses and anchors. In the central hall, the frieze between the ground and first floor is adorned with the words of psalm 107: &quot;They that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep. Anno Domini MCMVII&quot; (1907).

<text>The Sports were an Australian rock group which performed and recorded between 1976 and 1981. Mainstay members were Stephen Cummings on lead vocals and Robert Glover on bass guitar, with long-term members such as Paul Hitchins on drums, Andrew Pendlebury on lead guitar and vocals, and Martin Armiger on guitar. Their style was similar to both 1970s British pub rock bands (such as Brinsley Schwarz) and British new wave (such as Elvis Costello). The Sports&#x27; top forty singles are &quot;Who Listens to the Radio&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot;, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and &quot;How Come&quot; . Their top 20 releases on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart are &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot; (February 1979), &quot;Suddenly&quot; (March 1980) and &quot;Sondra&quot; (May 1981).

In October 2010 &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot; was listed in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

== History ==
The Sports were formed in 1976 by Stephen Cummings who had been the lead singer of Melbourne rockabilly group, The Pelaco Brothers, (which also comprised Joe Camilleri, Peter Lillie and Johnny Topper). The original line-up was Cummings and ex-The Pelaco Brothers bandmate, Ed Bates, on guitar, Robert Glover (ex-Myriad) on bass guitar, Jim Niven (ex-The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band) on piano and Paul Hitchins on drums. Their early sets contained covers of Chuck Berry, Billy Emerson, Don Covay, Company Caine and Graham Parker material. Original songs, mostly written by Cummings and Bates, completed their sets. The Sports&#x27; debut recording was a four-track extended play, &quot;Fair Game&quot;, which was released in early 1977 on the independent label, Zac Records. A friend in London posted the record to the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (aka &quot;NME&quot;) which declared it &#x27;Record of the Week&#x27;.

The Sports were in tune with music trends dominating London rock and had provided song-based rock as an antidote to punk, which was dubbed new wave. Cummings was compared favourably with Mick Jagger and Bates was praised for his slide guitar style: being similar to Little Feat. &quot;We were totally surprised&quot;, Cummings said in 1997 of the &quot;NME&quot; review; he continued, &quot;It was the last thing you&#x27;d expect. It was my making and my undoing in some ways. When you have everything go right so quickly you expect that everything after that is going to be good and that easy. It meant that I probably didn&#x27;t put myself out as much as I should have.&quot;

Andrew Pendlebury (ex-Myriad) joined on guitar in August 1977 and assisted Cummings with song writing. Cummings recalled, &quot;I just vaguely met people and dragged them into it. I always wanted Andrew in the group as a guitarist and I had an idea for a rockabilly country sound. But I always wanted to change it because I really liked the MC5 and wanted to make it more like that as well.&quot; In May 1978 The Sports issued their debut studio album, &quot;Reckless&quot;, on Mushroom Records with ex-The Pelaco Brothers bandmate, Camilieri, as their producer. John Magowan of &quot;Woroni&quot; enthused about the &quot;passionate, alive, and in its own way, unique&quot; album, which showed &quot;a perfect synthesis of archetypal 50&#x27;s romance and the cutting neurotic edge of life in the 70&#x27;s.&quot; Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it &quot;displayed plenty of charm, but failed to capture the atmosphere of the band&#x27;s sweaty live shows.&quot;

The lead track, &quot;Boys! (What Did the Detective Say?)&quot;, was released in March 1978 and peaked at 55 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. In England it provided some confusion with the similarly titled, &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;, by Elvis Costello, which had been released in the previous October.

In August 1978 Cummings brought in Martin Armiger (ex-Toads, Bleeding Hearts, High Rise Bombers) on guitar, vocals and for song writing, to replace Bates. According to McFarlane, Bates had been &quot;ousted&quot; as Armiger &quot;had a more commercial outlook&quot;. On the strength of &quot;Reckless&quot;, The Sports were chosen to support Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour&#x27;s Australian tour later that year. Luis Feliu of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; described The Sports in September that year, &quot;[their] roots lie in the fifties or early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, rhythm and blues ... [Cummings and Bates] pen short and sharp songs ... [while Armiger] brings with him a more electric sound.&quot; Parker arranged for The Sports to support their United Kingdom tour in February of the following year. Fellow Australian musician Keith Shadwick accompanied the band on the tour and wrote an extensive account for the Australian music magazine &quot;Roadrunner&quot;.

They supported Thin Lizzy at the iconic concert in front of an estimated 100,000 people at Sydney Opera House in October 1978.

In November, they started work on their second album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot;, with Pete Solley and Dave Robinson producing. It was released in February 1979 ahead of their joining Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour&#x27;s UK tour. Feliu felt &quot;plenty of admiration for their punchy and melodic rockabilly sound, [he] found the change to the more diverse, bigger-breath songs of new a wee strange but acceptable.&quot; While in the UK they recorded another four-track EP, &quot;O.K, U.K!&quot;, which appeared in August that year.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot; reached No. 9 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, which provided two top 40 singles, &quot;Who Listens to the Radio&quot; (November 1978) and the title track (March 1979). &quot;Who Listens to the Radio?&quot;, was their only hit on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart, peaking at No. 45 in November 1979. Stiff issued material from the first two Australian albums under the name, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot;, in October 1979; while Arista Records released it in the US and continental Europe.

The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Suddenly&quot;, was released in March 1980 and was also produced by Solley. Feliu opined that it showed &quot;trimmed up reggae-favoured tunes and souped-up straight, melodic rockers... [and] has its fair share of goodies&quot; while he &quot;had reservations about the overall slickness, and excesses in production for the sake of commercial acceptance&quot; by Solley. McFarlane noticed that it &quot;featured an even slicker, more commercial pop sound.&quot; In Australia, the album reached No. 13 and its lead single, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, peaked at No. 22. Before the album had appeared Hitchins was replaced by Iain McLennan (ex-Ariel, Mondo Rock) on drums and Niven was replaced by Red Symons (ex-Skyhooks) on keyboards. To promote the album, in March and April 1980, The Sports undertook a national tour with Mushroom label mates, Split Enz. Symons left after the tour and McLennan, who had hepatitis in May, was then replaced by Freddie Strauks (Symons&#x27; bandmate from Skyhooks) on drums.

In 1981, the Sports had another top 30 hit on the Australian singles chart with &quot;How Come&quot;; and a top 20 album with &quot;Sondra&quot;. The Sports broke up late in 1981 with Cummings going on a solo singing career; Armiger became a composer for film and TV after moving to Sydney; Pendlebury joined The Dugites; Strauks joined Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons; and Glover was in Wilbur Wilde&#x27;s backing band. In October 2010, their 1979 album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Stones&quot;, was listed in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

On 14 November 1998, the band reformed for a one-off performance at the Mushroom 25 concert, held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Mushroom Records.

Jim Niven died of cancer on 9 April 2012.

<text>Angel Mounds State Historic Site (12 VG 1), an expression of the Mississippian culture, is an archaeological site managed by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites that includes more than of land about southeast of present-day Evansville, in Vanderburgh and Warrick counties in Indiana. The large residential and agricultural community was constructed and inhabited from AD 1100 to AD 1450, and served as the political, cultural, and economic center of the Angel chiefdom. It extended within of the Ohio River valley to the Green River in present-day Kentucky. The town had as many as 1,000 inhabitants inside the walls at its peak, and included a complex of thirteen earthen mounds, hundreds of home sites, a palisade (stockade), and other structures.

Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, the property also includes an interpretive center, recreations of Mississippian structures, a replica of a 1939 Works Projects Administration archaeology laboratory, and a area away from the archaeological site that is a nature preserve. The historic site continues to preserve and relate the story of pre-contact Middle Mississippian indigenous culture on the Ohio River.

The site is named after the Angel family, who in 1852 began purchasing the farmland on which the archaeological site is located. In 1938, the Indiana Historical Society, with funding from Eli Lilly, purchased of property to preserve it and to use it for long-term archaeological research. From 1939 to 1942, the Works Progress Administration employed more than 250 workers to excavate of the site, which resulted in the recording and processing of 2.3 million archaeological items. After excavation was temporarily halted during World War II, work resumed in 1945 as part of the Indiana University Archaeology Field School during the summer months. In 1946, the Indiana Historical Society transferred ownership of the site to the State of Indiana. It manages the site through the Indiana State Museum. Archaeological research on Angel Mounds, once conducted through the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology, is now overseen by the IU Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Indiana University Bloomington.

==History==
===Origins===
For thousands of years, the area that was later organized as the eastern United States was home to a succession of native groups who settled near the rivers and used them for travel and trade. The widespread Mississippian culture, which is named in reference to its geographical origins along the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries, developed around AD 900. This culture eventually extended as far west as Oklahoma, as far north as the present-day suburbs of Saint Louis, Missouri, in southwestern Illinois, and ranging east into the Southeastern Woodlands, to present-day North Carolina and as far south as present-day Mississippi.

===Site development and decline===
The people of the Middle Mississippian culture built and lived in a community (in what became southwestern Indiana around AD 1100 and remained there until AD 1450, a period that Marjory Honerkamp defined in the 1970s as the Angel phase. The Angel phase and the Mississippian culture town are named after the Angel family, who in 1852 began purchasing farmland that included the archaeological site.

Archeologist Sherri Hilgeman and others have used the distinctive pottery produced at the Angel site and in other satellite communities in this section of the Ohio River valley to define the Angel phase as the middle period between the Emergent Mississippian Yankeetown phase (AD 750 to AD 1000) and the Terminal Mississippian Caborn-Wellborn phase (AD 1400 to AD 1700).

The Angel chiefdom (a simple hierarchy led by a chief) was the regional trading center in a group of communities within of the Ohio River valley; it extended as far as the Green River in present-day Kentucky. The large residential and agricultural community was also the political, cultural, and economic center of the chiefdom, whose residents traded with other chiefdoms and peoples along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The Angel community primarily inhabited an area bounded by the Ohio River to the south, the White River and its East Fork to the north, the Wabash River to the west, and the Anderson River to the east. Archaeologists have inferred that the smaller communities (villages, hamlets, farmsteads and camp sites) were politically subordinate to the main Angel site. Continuing excavations at the site have revealed new elements of the complex society.

Laborers built the main Angel site sometime after AD 1000. They also established the surrounding villages and farming areas along the Ohio River and engaged in hunting and farming on the rich bottom lands. In addition, the Mississippian culture is known for its 
earthen mounds, designed in shapes including platform, conical, and ridgetop (as also seen at the largest center, Cahokia in present-day southern Illinois). Working with a variety of soils to create a stable mass, the Mississippian people built major earthworks at the Angel site. The community eventually covered about and included thirteen mounds near the Ohio River. Some of these mounds were built for ceremonial and cosmological purposes. In addition to the mounds, the Mississippians constructed structures and a defensive palisade (stockade) made of wattle and daub with walls and punctuated with bastions. This settlement was the largest-known town of its time in what became present-day Indiana. Scholars believe the town may have had as many as 1,000 inhabitants at its peak, which Indiana archeologist Glenn Albert Black estimated to be about 200 households.

Archaeologists believe that the Angel community existed from around AD 1100 to around AD 1450, although estimates for the site vary from AD 1000 to AD 1600. Carbon dating of the community indicate it was developed as early as AD 1200 and as late as AD 1500.

The Mississippian people abandoned the Angel site long before European contact; however, it is not known for certain why the Angel civilization declined. Scholars have speculated that it was potentially due to environmental factors, such as an extended regional drought that reduced the maize (corn) surpluses, and resulted in increasingly scarce natural resources that had once enabled the concentration of population. In addition, the people may have been overhunting, and reducing forests through the consumption of wood for constructing buildings and making fires. Archaeologists also theorize that with the collapse of the Angel chiefdom by AD 1450, many of the site&#x27;s inhabitants relocated downriver to the confluence of the Ohio and Wabash rivers. A separate Late Mississippian cultural group subsequently emerged that archeologists named the Terminal Mississippian Caborn-Welborn phase (AD 1400 to AD 1700).

===Subsequent settlement===
Angel Mounds scholars believe that the Mississippians abandoned the site by AD 1400, and the Ohio River valley by AD 1650. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, groups of other native peoples, such as the Shawnee, the Miami, and other historical tribes moved into the Ohio River valley from the east over the next 150 years. European explorers and traders subsequently arrived in the area. Anglo-American settlers who migrated to the area from the east and south remained to farm the land. Both the Native Americans and other settlers were attracted by the rich soil and temperate growing season.

Mathias Angel (1819–1899) was among these settlers. In 1852 he began purchasing farmland that also included the archaeological site. The Angel Mounds Historic Site is named after the Angel family and their descendants.

===Site acquisition===
In May 1931, Warren K. Moorehead, a nationally known archaeologist from Ohio State University and the Peabody Foundation; Eli Lilly, who became president of Eli Lilly and Company in 1932 and served as the president of the Indiana Historical Society from 1932 to 1947; and Glenn A. Black and E. Y. Guernsey, Society employees and archaeologists, visited the Angel site as part of a tour to assess Indiana&#x27;s archaeological sites. Black, who served as the Society&#x27;s director of archaeology and from 1939 to 1964 supervised excavation and field schools at the Angel site, thought that the mounds would provide an opportunity to conduct a long-term study of a single archaeological site. Although individuals had been surveying the area and digging at the Angel site prior to the beginning of its official excavation in 1939, the archaeological findings were not properly documented. Some individuals also came to the site simply to collect relics.

In 1938, the Indiana Historical Society purchased of property from the Angel family descendants and others to protect the archaeological site from destruction. The mounds were in danger of being destroyed due to construction of a planned levee and real estate development. Eli Lilly in his role as a philanthropist interested in Indiana&#x27;s prehistory, provided the funds for the purchase.

===Early excavation===
Initial efforts in 1938–39 focused on surveying and clearing the main archaeological site and an outlying camp. From 1939 to 1942, as a project financed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, the Works Projects Administration employed more than 250 workers under the direction of Indiana archeologist Glenn A. Black to excavate of the site. These efforts resulted in the recording and processing of 2.3 million archaeological items. Excavation was temporarily halted during World War II, but resumed in 1945 as part of the Indiana University Archaeology Field School during the summer months.

In 1946, the Indiana Historical Society transferred ownership of the property to the State of Indiana, but retained the rights to excavate the site. Black remained on the property as its caretaker. Between 1958 and 1962, two National Science Foundation grants provided financial support to assess geophysical applications at the site, including use of a proton magnetometer to trace segments of the site&#x27;s palisade (stockade) walls that were not visible from the surface. This project, which extended the work begun by the University of Oxford&#x27;s Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, was one of the &quot;first comprehensive tests in the Americas&quot; to assess the instrument&#x27;s potential on a New World site.

===State historic site===
Angel Mounds was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, the same year that the Indiana Historical Society transferred its archeological excavation rights to Indiana University. The site&#x27;s original purchase was later augmented by Elda Clayton Herts&#x27;s donation of containing an early Woodland period mound.

The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites is the present-day manager of the site. Research on Angel Mounds is conducted through the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology, founded in 1965 at Indiana University Bloomington and named in honor of Glenn Albert Black, the archaeologist who conducted excavations at Angel Mounds from 1939 to 1964, and brought the site to national attention. Since 1945, Indiana University has continued to conduct an archaeology field school at the site during the summer months.

The Angel Mounds State Historic Site, a National Historic Landmark, is recognized as one of the best-preserved prehistoric sites in the United States for understanding Middle Mississippian culture along the Ohio River, and Native American culture before contact with Europeans. The site occupies more than of land and includes an interpretive center (opened to the public in 1972), recreations of Mississippian structures, and a replica of a 1939 WPA archaeology laboratory. A area of the property, which does not include the archaeological site, has a nature preserve and recreational trails. Archaeological excavations at Angel Mounds State Historic Site continue through Indiana University&#x27;s field school.

==Setting==
The Angel site was the regional trading center in a group of associated settlements and hamlets within a radius. The town overlooks the Ohio River, which borders the town&#x27;s south side, and includes terraced land and earthen mounds built above the river&#x27;s flood plain. The main site is close to agricultural fields and is shielded from the river by what is known in the present-day as Three Mile Island. The community faces south across a narrow channel toward the island and what is present-day Kentucky. The channel and slough, which existed during the time that the archaeological site was inhabited, created a quiet backwater that surrounded the town on the north, east, and west sides. The slough and channel to the Ohio River provided easy transit for canoes, as well as a source for freshwater fishing, potable water, and bathing.

(Until nearly the end of the nineteenth century, the Ohio River was clear and potable. In the mid-twentieth century, the channel was known as an excellent fishing area.) When the site was first settled, the slough was deeper and the Mississippian people kept it cleared of brush and trees; however, by 1939, when official excavation of the Angel site began, the stream had dried-up and the channel had eroded, providing a land surface that was often stable enough to walk across.

The Mississippians found the site along the Ohio River ideal for agricultural purposes. Annual spring floods regularly replenished the nutrients in the soil and allowed cultivation of crops that included maize (corn), beans, and squash. The fertile soil enabled production of surplus crops, which the Mississippian people used for trade and to support a higher density population that developed artisan and craft specialties such as pottery.

==Mounds==

The site includes six large platform mounds (Mounds A through F), five smaller mounds (Mounds H through L), and at least one large plaza. Mound G, which is older than the others, may not have been part of the Angel phase group. A defensive palisade with bastions nearly surrounded the approximately town. Mounds A (Central Mound), E, and F (Temple Mound), the largest mounds at the site, are truncate pyramidal earthen structures with either a square or rectangular base. Mound A and Mound F, constructed about AD 1050 to 1100, were used until the Mississippians abandoned the site about AD 1400, and then burned. Mounds I and K may have been constructed over older mound structures.

===Mound A (Central Mound)===
Mound A, also called the Central Mound, is the largest and highest () in the complex. It also among the largest prehistoric structures in the eastern United States. Central Mound contains three levels with a smaller conical mound in the southeast corner of the upper level. The base mound is long and wide.

Laborers carried of dirt in baskets from the chute (a waterway along the south side of the town) to create the mound. The lower terrace, measuring by , is on the south side of the mound. The upper terrace is above the surrounding area. Based on reports from early European explorers in the southeastern United States who encountered active Mississippian culture villages, this mound was likely the residence of the hereditary chief of the town and the surrounding communities. (It is generally believed that upper-class members of society would live on the highest mounds, while lower-class members inhabited smaller living spaces.) The State of Indiana constructed a modern stairway ascending the mound to protect it from erosion of pedestrian traffic. Archeological evidence suggests there may have been a log stairway in prehistoric times.

===Mound F (Temple Mound)===
Mound F, the only mound that is completed excavated, was a platform mound measuring by and in height. Excavations showed that the mound was built in several construction phases with different occupation episodes on the different levels. The episodes of occupation include a structure at the original ground layer, followed by another structure on what is known as &quot;occupational layer 2&quot;. This was then covered by the &quot;inner mound surface&quot;, a layer of mound fill and more structures. The structures on this level seemed to have been domestic in nature. The next layer of mound fill is known as the &quot;primary mound surface&quot; and was surmounted by a large rectangular structure with at least two rooms and anterooms, or porticoes, appended to it. The final layer of mound fill is the &quot;secondary mound surface&quot;. Due to the amount of historic period soil disturbance on the summit it is unclear if any structures sat atop this phase. Mound F was destroyed during the process of its excavation and subsequently re-constructed to show its original appearance. The reconstruction features a temple structure surrounded by a palisade and stairs leading to the summit.

===Mound E===
Mound E, the third largest mound, measures by . Its upper platform is by . Because this earthen mound was never cultivated, it is considered to be the site&#x27;s best example of a truncate mound.

==Palisade==
Archaeological excavation revealed a set of two palisade (stockade) walls. The outer palisade surrounded the perimeter of the town with the Ohio River acting as a barrier on the south side. An inner palisade bisected the interior of the site. An entrance to the town was believed to have been on southwest corner of the palisade, based on archaeological findings at that location. Parallel to the stockade walls, another barrier (similar to a picket fence) was set outside the stockade. It was designed to slow attackers as they came into range.

A reconstruction of part of the stockade, based on archeological evidence, was made in 1972. The reconstructed walls are high and have wooden posts set deep into a narrow trench. The walls and posts are covered with wattle and daub (a loose weaving of sticks covered with a mud-and-grass plaster). Defensive bastions along the stockade walls were also reconstructed. The original inhabitants set the bastions about apart and projecting to from the wall. The distance between each bastion allowed defenders using arrows or lances to protect the walls from direct attack.

==Other structural features==
When residences were no longer &quot;serviceable,&quot; the Mississippians burned the structures and constructed a new one over the ashes. Indiana archaeologist Glenn A. Black posited that walls were covered in cane and plastered with mud and straw. Roof composition is uncertain, but Black thought they were grass thatch. Two construction methods were used, one for summer and another for winter. Two circular structures uncovered at the site are likely to have been sweat lodges (similar in use to present-day saunas). Or, they may have been used for meetings. The Mississippians also constructed what is believed to have been a public plaza between Mound A and Mound F.

==Artifacts==

About 2.4 million artifacts were collected during excavations conducted by WPA workers from 1939 to 1942. One of the most significant artifacts uncovered at the Angel site was a carved Mississippian culture stone statue of a seated man, which was found at Mound F in November 1940. The fluorite artifact is tall and weighs . Similar rare fluorite statues have been found at the Obion Mounds site in Henry County, Tennessee and the Ware Mounds site in Union County, Illinois.

Mississippian tools and weapons found at the site were made of igneous rock, sedimentary rock (sandstone), slate, shale, diorite, or cannel coal. Metalwork objects were very rare. Based on research and artifacts discovered at the Angel site, it is believed that the Mississippians used bone fishhooks and nets made of cord to catch mollusks and freshwater fish (catfish and drumfish). Spears with projectile points were used to hunt small game. Antler, animal and bird bone, shells, and animal teeth were also found.

Of the nearly 2 million sherds of pottery found at the site, 4,569 of them were of the negative-painted type. Textile patterns made inside of the pottery are a trait unique to the Angel site. In May 2006, researchers discovered a probable pottery-making workshop at the site. This discovery further revealed the artistic skills of the Mississippian culture people. Pottery tools and masses of prepared, slightly fired clay pieces were also found during the season&#x27;s excavation. It appeared to be a type of production-line process, with the works awaiting finishing and firing as bowls, jars or figures.

The archaeological objects and associated records from Angel Mounds are curated and cared for at the IU Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Bloomington, Indiana. The most recent preservation effort came through a three-year Save America&#x27;s Treasures grant administered by the National Park Service and the Institute of Museum and Library Services to rehouse the Angel Mounds collections.

==Kincaid Focus==
In the lower Ohio River valley in Illinois, Kentucky, and Indiana, the Mississippian-culture towns of Kincaid, Wickliffe, Tolu, and Angel Mounds have been grouped together into a &quot;Kincaid Focus&quot; set, due to similarities in pottery assemblages and site plans. Most striking are the comparisons between the Kincaid and Angel sites, which include analogous site plans, stylistic similarities in artifacts, and geographic proximity. These connections have led some scholars to hypothesize that the builders and residents were of the same society.

The 300- to 400-year span in which these types of artifacts and sites are found is called the &quot;Angel phase&quot;. It is divided into three subphases: 
Rare painted and incised sherds of Mississippian culture pottery have been found at all four sites, ranging from less than one percent near Kincaid to about three or four percent of the assemblage at Wickliffe. Some common pottery styles found in these sites include: Angel Negative Painted, Kincaid Negative Painted, and Matthews Incised. This pottery is shell-tempered and ranges from the smoothed surface and coarser temper of Mississippi Ware to the more polished surface and finer temper of Bell Ware.

==Burials==
During the WPA excavation of the site (1939 to 1942), more than 300 burials were uncovered, most of them in the site&#x27;s east village. Other burials were found on the sides of Mound F, at Mound I, or near the palisade walls. Although there are grave sites found throughout the Angel site, the remains of infant children were &quot;occasionally found beneath the floors of homes.&quot;

<doc id="1043068" wikidata="Q681424" url="?curid=1043068" title="Live 2003 (Coldplay album)">
<text>Live 2003 is the first live album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom. However, Capitol Records made it available on 4 November 2003 in the United States, with screenings at select theaters being held a day before as well. Featuring the shows filmed at Sydney&#x27;s Hordern Pavilion on 21 and 22 July 2003, the album marks the group&#x27;s second live project after &quot;Trouble – Norwegian Live EP&quot; (2001).

It was nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, and named one of the greatest releases of the year by &quot;Blender&quot;. The song &quot;Moses&quot;, exclusive to the album, was written about Chris Martin&#x27;s then-wife Gwyneth Paltrow and inspired the name of their second child, born in 2006. It was sent to alternative radio stations in the United States as a promotional single on 6 October, while the recording of &quot;Clocks&quot; had a promotional push in countries such as Mexico and Spain.

<doc id="1043075" wikidata="Q11898549" url="?curid=1043075" title="National income policy agreement (Finland)">
<text>Finnish national income policy agreements or comprehensive income policy agreements (, often called &quot;tupo&quot;; ) are tripartite agreements between Finnish trade unions, employers&#x27; organizations, and the Finnish government. They are policy documents covering a wide range of economic and political issues, such as salaries, taxation, pensions, unemployment benefits, and housing costs. They represent collective bargaining taken to its logical maximum, reaching virtually all wage-earners. Their enforcement is made easier by the universal validity of collective labour agreements. However, they are voluntary agreements and are not considered government legislation, i.e. they do not represent central planning of the economy.

In national income policy agreements, the government and the employees&#x27; and employers&#x27; organizations attempt to reach a common understanding of the best choices for the national economy in terms of economic growth and real wages. The basic conundrum is simple: employees want higher salaries, employers want no wage hikes. The government wants to maintain international competitiveness and a high employment rate, while simultaneously ensuring sufficient tax revenues and keeping inflation in check.

National income policy agreements are usually valid for a two-year period. These agreements are not compulsory. If the employers&#x27; and employees&#x27; national organisations cannot agree on terms, no agreement is signed. In that case, negotiations on salaries are carried out by individual trade federations with no government participation. Sometimes talks are not even initiated due to differences of opinion between employers&#x27; and employees&#x27; organizations.

==History==
The first national income policy agreement was negotiated by National Labour Dispute Conciliator Keijo Liinamaa. In 1967, Liinamaa was given a special task by Prime Minister Rafael Paasio: Liinamaa was to negotiate a comprehensive economic deal with employers&#x27; organisations and labour unions in order to prevent inflation due to rising wages. These negotiations resulted in the first national income policy agreement, the so-called &quot;Liinamaa I&quot; and brought fame to Liinamaa, a later caretaker prime minister. The tradition of comprehensive agreements has been particularly persistent since then, even if there are always doomsayers predicting their end. Currently, there is no such agreement. This follows from the political pressures to increase public sector competitivity that led to comparatively higher increases in public sector wages, particularly nurses&#x27; wages.

In 2008, the main employer&#x27;s union Confederation of Finnish Industries, representing 70% of Finland&#x27;s GDP, announced that new national income policy agreements will not be made, and that they will radically reduce the influence of the central union, and close down the special office that has prepared previous agreements. The reasons cited were the inflexibility of comprehensive agreements, their incompatibility with global markets and the differences between different industries. This was met by accusations of irresponsibility from some trade union leaders.

The agreements have ultimately been an effective way to curb inflation, particularly in recent times where globalization has placed pressure on both the employers and employees. The consensus policy unravelled several &quot;perpetual inflation machine&quot; problems: wages tied to price indices, constant competition over nominal wages between different employee unions resulting in constant nominal wage hikes, the government effectively subsidising these wage hikes by subsidising exports based on costs (including wages), and perpetual strikes to increase minor benefits (particularly Niilo Wälläri&#x27;s seamen&#x27;s union). On the other hand, a comprehensive agreement maintains distortions that have arisen between different industries, i.e. when wages are too low in one industry relative to other industries.

<text>Raymond C. &quot;Ray&quot; Bonin (born November 20, 1942) is a former Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Nickel Belt, from 1993 to 2008. Prior to entering politics, he was a teacher at Sudbury&#x27;s Cambrian College. He was also chairman of the French Catholic school board from 1976 to 1985, and was a city councillor from 1988 to 1991.

On November 16, 2006, Bonin announced that he would not run for reelection in the 2008 federal election. Former Greater Sudbury city councillor Louise Portelance won the nomination to stand as the new Liberal candidate for Nickel Belt, but was defeated by Claude Gravelle of the New Democratic Party on election day.

<doc id="1043095" wikidata="Q6181938" url="?curid=1043095" title="Joseph Smith Sr.">
<text>Joseph Smith Sr. (July 12, 1771 – September 14, 1840) was the father of Joseph Smith Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Joseph Sr. was also one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, which Mormons believe was translated by Smith Jr. from golden plates. In 1833, Smith Sr. was named the first patriarch of the Church of Christ (which was renamed to the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1834 and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838). Joseph Sr. was also a member of the First Presidency of the church.

He was one of the first recipients of the controversial Second Anointing ritual in 1833. During the ceremony, he gave his son Joseph Smith Jr. a blessing indicating Smith Jr. would, &quot;continue in his Priests office until Christ come.&quot;

==Early life==
Smith was born on July 12, 1771, in Topsfield, Massachusetts, to Asael Smith and Mary Duty. He married Lucy Mack in Tunbridge, Vermont, on January 26, 1796, and had 11 children with her. Details of Smith’s paternal line go back to his 3rd great-grandfather Robert Smith from Lincolnshire, England who settled in Massachusetts colony during the Puritan migration. Some previous DNA testing on Smith’s descendants had revealed some Irish roots.

Smith tried his hands at several occupations, including farmer, teacher, and shop-keeper, none of which proved very successful. He moved his family to Palmyra, New York, in 1816 and began to make payments on a farm located on the edge of neighboring Manchester Township. In the Palmyra–Manchester area, Smith and his sons were involved in a number of treasure digging excavations in the 1820s.

Work on a frame house at the farm was halted by the unexpected death of Smith&#x27;s eldest son, Alvin, in 1823. Smith subsequently failed to make payments on the farm. Lemuel Durfee purchased it as a favor to the family and allowed the Smiths to continue there as renters until 1830.

Though a spiritual man, Smith showed little interest in organized religion prior to his son Joseph reporting his visions to the family. He was content to allow his wife control over the religious upbringing of their children. This indifference bothered Lucy very much. After much prayer, she said she had received a divine witness that her husband would some day accept &quot;the pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God.&quot;

Smith professed that he had visionary dreams with highly symbolic content, perhaps related to his ambivalence about religious faith and sometimes presaging events to come. These dreams continued after the family&#x27;s move to Palmyra until he had had seven in all; Lucy remembered five well enough to quote in detail.

==Book of Mormon==

In the late 1820s, Smith&#x27;s son, Joseph Jr., began to tell the family about golden plates, which he said contained a record of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. In September 1827, Joseph Jr. said he obtained the plates. In the following years, Joseph Jr. said he translated the plates into English through the use of a seer stone, which he found previously during a treasure digging expedition, as well as the Urim and Thummim, a device given to him by the angel Moroni. When the work was near completion, at the end of June 1829, Joseph Sr. and seven other men signed a joint statement, testifying that they had both lifted the plates and seen the engravings on the plates. Known as the &quot;Testimony of the Eight Witnesses&quot;, this statement was published with the first edition of the Book of Mormon and has been a part of nearly all subsequent editions.

Smith was baptized when the Church of Christ was formally organized on April 6, 1830. When Joseph Jr. saw Joseph Sr. come up out of the water, he is reported to have cried, &quot;Oh! My God I have lived to see my own father baptized into the true church of Jesus Christ!&quot;

==Presiding Patriarch==
In January 1831, Smith and his family moved to the church&#x27;s new headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. He was ordained to be the church&#x27;s first Presiding Patriarch on December 18, 1833.

In reference to his father&#x27;s role as patriarch of the church, Joseph Jr. likened his father to Adam, the first biblical patriarch: &quot;So shall it be with my father; he shall be called a prince over his posterity, holding the keys of the patriarchal priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth, even the Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot;.

As part of his new role, Smith presided in council meetings and administered patriarchal blessings.

On September 3, 1837, Smith was also made an Assistant Counselor to his son in the First Presidency of the church.

==Participation in the Second Anointing==
Smith was present at the first performance of the Second Anointing ritual, the highest ordinance in the Latter-day Saint movement, which guarantees salvation and confers godhood.

Joseph Smith Jr. hosted the first recorded version of this ritual in January 1833. During the meeting, Smith Jr. washed the feet of all 12 men present, pausing to ask his father for a priesthood blessing before washing Smith Sr.&#x27;s feet. Joseph Smith Sr. &quot;pronouncing upon his head that he should continue in his Priests office until Christ come.&quot;

Joseph Smith Jr. taught the participants of the ritual that they were &quot;sealed up unto salvation.&quot;

==Deathbed blessings==

Smith moved with his family to Far West, Missouri, in 1838 and from there to the church&#x27;s new headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1839. Old age and illnesses had taken their toll and by the end of summer 1840, Smith realized he was dying. He called his family around him to administer patriarchal blessings.

He blessed his wife: &quot;Mother, do you not know that you are the mother of as great a family as ever lived upon the earth. ... They are raised up to do the Lord&#x27;s work&quot;. He blessed and ordained his eldest surviving son, Hyrum to succeed to the office of Presiding Patriarch by right of lineage.

Smith died in Nauvoo on September 14, 1840.

<doc id="1043102" wikidata="Q2034767" url="?curid=1043102" title="Salomon Brothers">
<text>Salomon Brothers, Inc., was an American multinational bulge bracket investment bank headquartered in New York City. It was one of the five largest investment banking enterprises in the United States and a very profitable firm on Wall Street during the 1980s and 1990s. Its CEO and chairman at that time, John Gutfreund, was nicknamed &quot;the King of Wall Street&quot;.

Salomon Brothers served many of the largest corporations in America. It was a leading underwriter of corporate bonds and one of the top firms in futures and options (known as &quot;derivatives&quot;) and in securitization in a range of asset classes including commercial real estate securities.

The bank was famed for its &quot;cutthroat corporate culture that rewarded risk-taking with massive bonuses, punishing poor results with a swift boot.&quot; In Michael Lewis&#x27; 1989 book &quot;Liar&#x27;s Poker&quot;, the insider descriptions of life at Salomon gave way to the popular view of banking in the 1980s and 1990s as a money-focused and work-intensive environment. It was acquired by Travelers Group in 1997, which in turn became part of Citigroup the next year.

In February 2022, it was announced that the Salomon Brothers brand will be revived by a group of former employees and execs and operate as full-service investment bank again.

==History==
===Founding===
Founded in 1910 by Arthur, Herbert, and Percy Salomon and a clerk, Ben Levy. The founding Salomon Brothers are descendants of Haym Salomon, primary financier of the American Revolutionary War, Consul to France, and childhood friend to Robert Morris, Founding Father and Superintendent of Finance of the United States. The company remained a partnership until the early 1980s. William Salomon, the son of Percy Salomon, became a managing partner and the head of the company in 1963.

In 1967, Salomon Brothers sponsored Muriel Siebert, the first woman to obtain a trading license on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

=== Top ranking and public financing: 1970-1979 ===
In 1975, Salomon Brothers was formally recognized by other top investment banks as a &quot;bulge bracket&quot; firm, meaning it was one of the leaders in investment banking. In 1979, Salomon Brothers scored a major coup when IBM insisted that Morgan Stanley accept Salomon Brothers as co-manager on a $1-billion debt issue for a new generation of IBM computers. Morgan Stanley demanded sole management, but IBM affirmed Salomon Brothers’ role as co-manager. In response, Morgan Stanley refused to act as co-manager, and Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were awarded top billing as a result.

In 1975, Salomon Brothers also aided the state’s efforts to save New York City from bankruptcy. When the Municipal Action Committee (MAC) was established and bonds were created in its name, Salomon Brothers and Morgan Guaranty Trust organized syndicates for the $1 billion bond sale. Both of the organizations were able to place the bonds successfully.

In 1978, John Gutfreund became a managing partner, and succeeded William Salomon as head of the company.

===Salomon Brothers during the 1980s===
In 1981, it was acquired by the commodity trading firm Phibro Corporation and became &quot;Salomon Inc&quot;. It was the reverse merger that enabled Gutfreund to take the company public. Gutfreund became the CEO of the company following the reverse merger.

During the 1980s, Salomon was noted for its innovation in the bond market, selling the first mortgage-backed security, a hitherto obscure species of financial instrument created by Ginnie Mae. Shortly thereafter, Salomon purchased home mortgages from thrifts throughout the United States and packaged them into mortgage-backed securities, which it sold to local and international investors. Later, it moved away from traditional investment banking (helping companies raise funds in the capital market and negotiating mergers and acquisitions) to almost exclusively proprietary trading (the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, options, etc. for the profit of the company itself). Salomon had expertise in fixed income securities and trading based on daily swings in the bond market.

The firm competed for the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco and the leveraged buyout of Revco stores (which ended in failure).

In 1987, a New York Times report identified Salomon Brothers as in the top tier of firms along with Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

Salomon Brothers&#x27; success in the 1980s is documented in Michael Lewis&#x27; 1989 book, &quot;Liar&#x27;s Poker&quot;. Lewis went through Salomon&#x27;s training program and then became a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers in London. Lewis presented an insider description of life at Salomon Brothers, and his book became a seminal work in terms of understanding the corporate culture at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s.

Lewis describing the trading floor at Salomon:

===1990s treasury bonds crisis===
In 1991, U.S. Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Mike Basham learned that Salomon trader Paul Mozer had been submitting false bids in an attempt to purchase more treasury bonds than permitted by one buyer during the period between December 1990 and May 1991. Salomon was fined $190million for this infraction, and required to set aside $100million in a restitution fund for any injured parties. In December 1993, Mozer was sentenced to four months in a minimum-security prison and fined $30,000. CEO Gutfreund left the company in August 1991 and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settlement resulted in a fine of $100,000 and Gutfreund being barred from serving as a chief executive of a brokerage firm. Warren Buffett briefly stepped into the CEO and chairman position. Buffett later promoted Deryck Maughan to take over as chairman and CEO. The scandal was then documented in the 1993 book &quot;Nightmare on Wall Street&quot;. The firm was acquired by Travelers Group in 1997.

The firm&#x27;s top bond traders called themselves &quot;Big Swinging Dicks,&quot; and were the inspiration for the novel &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, written by Tom Wolfe. The expression &quot;Big Swinging Dick(s)&quot; itself was used to refer to the Salomon bankers who dominated the game of extraordinary profit-making.

Some members of the Salomon Brothers&#x27; bond arbitrage, such as John Meriwether, Myron Scholes and Eric Rosenfeld later became involved with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund that collapsed in 1998. The last years of Salomon Brothers, culminating in its involvement with LTCM, is chronicled in the 2007 book &quot;A Demon of Our Own Design&quot;.

===Acquisition by Citigroup===
Salomon (NYSE:SB) was acquired by Travelers Group in 1997; and, following the latter&#x27;s merger with Citicorp in 1998, Salomon became part of Citigroup. The combined investment banking operations became known as Salomon Smith Barney. 7 World Trade Center, which had served as the headquarters for Salomon Brothers, continued to be used as the company&#x27;s main office after the company was merged into Salomon Smith Barney.
Although the Salomon name carried on as Salomon Smith Barney, the investment banking operations of Citigroup, the division was renamed on 7 April 2003 to &quot;Citigroup Global Markets Inc.&quot; As of 2020, Citigroup no longer owns the Salomon Brothers trademark, according to the records provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

<doc id="1043108" wikidata="Q695389" url="?curid=1043108" title="I Heart Huckabees">
<text>I Heart Huckabees (stylized as i ♥ huckabees; also I Love Huckabees) is a 2004 independent black comedy film directed and produced by David O. Russell, who cowrote the screenplay with Jeff Baena.

A self-described &quot;existential comedy&quot;, &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; follows a pair of detectives (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) hired to investigate the meaning of the life of their clients (Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman, Mark Wahlberg and Naomi Watts). As the different investigations cross paths, their rival and nemesis (Isabelle Huppert) tries to drag their clients into her own views on the meaning of their lives.

==Plot==

Young Albert Markovski heads the local chapter of the &quot;Open Spaces Coalition&quot; environmental group. One of their current projects is stopping the building of a new &quot;big-box&quot; department store, Huckabees.

Albert is a rival of Brad Stand, a shallow executive at Huckabees. Brad infiltrates Open Spaces and charismatically displaces Albert as the leader. Dawn Campbell is Brad&#x27;s live-in girlfriend and the face and voice of Huckabees, appearing in all the store&#x27;s ads.

After seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times, Albert contacts a couple of existential detectives, Bernard and Vivian Jaffe. They offer him their optimistic brand of existentialism — they call it &quot;universal interconnectivity&quot; (combining romantic and transcendentalist philosophies) — and spy on him, ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence. Fireman Tommy Corn is another client of the Jaffes&#x27;, with an idealistic, obsessively anti-petroleum-industry philosophy. They introduce Albert to Tommy as his &quot;other&quot;, and they become friends.

Tommy grows dissatisfied with the Jaffes, feeling they are not helping. Seeking other possibilities, he ends up abandoning (and undermining) the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban, a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic/pessimist philosophy.

Caterine teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and problems; to synthesize a non-thinking state of &quot;pure being&quot;. Lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever. However, she says it is inevitable to be drawn back into human drama, and the core truth of it is misery and meaninglessness. To prove her point, Caterine takes Albert into the woods to have sex, leaving Tommy behind. He finds out about it and feels hurt. She tells him that they found each other through all the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them, furious and lost.

Meanwhile, in Brad&#x27;s further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the subsequent days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives; she rejects the modeling world, looking for deeper meaning, while he realizes his whole ascent up the corporate ladder is meaningless, for he has focused his whole life on trying to please others and not himself.

All the storylines collide when Brad&#x27;s house catches fire. While the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam, Tommy arrives on his bicycle to put out the fire, which also trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, they fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his home, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Caterine, to realize the cosmic truth of everything.

Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to him that the fire started when he burned Brad&#x27;s jet skis, and it spread to the rest of the house. He says they are no different; that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, believing she can help him as she did Albert and Tommy.

Albert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened. Caterine and the Jaffes watch them from afar, concluding they can close both of their cases.

==Production==
Before directing his first feature, &quot;Spanking the Monkey&quot;, Russell intended to make a film &quot;about a guy who sits in the back of a Chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody&#x27;s conversations, then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people&quot;. 

Hitting a writer&#x27;s block, Russell could not figure out how to make the film work. In the meantime, Russell was called for jury duty, after which he stopped writing the film. Ideas in the script stayed with him, though, and they would eventually form the basis for the Huckabee script. The final idea came to Russell in a dream in which &quot;this female detective, she was not following me for criminal reasons, but she was following me for spiritual and metaphysical reasons&quot;. Russell, with a habit of writing down his dreams, knew instantly on reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue.

===Incident between David O. Russell and Lily Tomlin===
In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto YouTube portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin. When the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, &quot;I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie — even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he&#x27;s a very free-form kind of guy anyway.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
Jon Brion provided the score and seven original songs for the film. His methods for writing his previous film scores (&quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; and &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;) involved very close collaboration with the director. Through this process, David O. Russell was able to sit in the same room with Brion and watch an early cut of the film. Russell described what he wanted to portray, and Brion would compose music to Russell&#x27;s descriptions. The process can be seen in a featurette on the film&#x27;s special edition DVD.

David O. Russell, while working with Brion, came across Brion&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Meaningless&quot;. Russell has mentioned that Brion&#x27;s album asks similar questions to the ones Russell was trying to ask with &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;. In particular, Russell notes that the questions on &quot;Meaningless&quot; are closer to the questions directed from Caterine Vauban&#x27;s negative and dark point of view.

Many cues used in the film feature a Chamberlin, a keyboard instrument from the 1950s that replicates instrumental sounds using recorded tape.

==Release==
===Marketing===
In an advertising campaign for the film, four fictional websites were created. They were portrayed as if they were actual websites involving the characters and organizations featured in the film. Each website had a link called &quot;Disclaimer&quot; at the bottom that lead to FOX Searchlight&#x27;s official website for the film. Websites were rendered inactive a few months after release, each one redirecting to FOX Searchlight&#x27;s website.
* Huckabees Corporation: The &quot;official&quot; website for the chain of Huckabees stores. Featured the store history, announcements, three television ads featuring Dawn Campbell, and a banner promoting the Huckabees collaboration with the Open Spaces Coalition.
* Open Spaces Coalition: This website described the importance of the marshlands that Albert Markovski is trying to protect, as well as ways of aiding the cause. The site also contained poetry written by Markovski, and downloadable flyers.
* Existential Detectives: The website promoting the Jaffes&#x27; detective agency. It explained the methodology of the detectives. It had two case studies and an online questionnaire.
* Caterine Vauban: The website of Caterine Vauban, author of &quot;If Not Now&quot;. The site contained reviews and excerpts from the book.

===Box office===
&quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; opened in a limited release October 1, 2004, earning $292,177, and ranking number 24 in the weekend&#x27;s box office. The film was granted a wide release three weeks later on October 22, earning $2,902,468, and ranking tenth at the box office. At the end of its run, the film grossed $12,785,432 domestically, and $7,286,740 overseas, for a worldwide total of $20,072,172.

==Reception==
The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Some critics were displeased with the existential subject matter, and said the script was unfocused, while others celebrated its performances (especially Wahlberg&#x27;s) and originality. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 64% rating, based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; certainly isn&#x27;t for everyone, but audiences attuned to its quirky wavelength will find a singularly brainy screwball comedy that refuses to pander.&quot; Metacritic reports a 55 rating out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In an article for &quot;New Review of Film and Television Studies&quot;, film scholar Kim Wilkins labeled the dialogue in &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; &quot;hyper-dialogue&quot;, which is described as &quot;intensified, unevenly fluctuating, and often ironically inflected use of dialogue in the place of action&quot;.

<text>Leslie Alvin White (January 19, 1900, Salida, Colorado – March 31, 1975, Lone Pine, California) was an American anthropologist known for his advocacy of the theories on cultural evolution, sociocultural evolution, and especially neoevolutionism, and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. White was president of the American Anthropological Association (1964).

==Early years==

White lived first in Kansas and then Louisiana. He volunteered to fight in World War I, serving in the US Navy before enrolling at Louisiana State University in 1919. In 1921, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied psychology, receiving a B.A. in 1923 and a M.A. in 1924. His PhD in Anthropology and Sociology came from the University of Chicago(1925).

White studied at Columbia, where Franz Boas had lectured, however he supported cultural evolution as defined by writers such as Lewis. H Morgan and Edward Tylor. White&#x27;s interests were diverse, and he took classes in several other disciplines, including philosophy at UCLA, and clinical psychiatry, before discovering anthropology via Alexander Goldenweiser courses at the New School for Social Research. White also spent a few weeks with the Menominee and Winnebago in Wisconsin during his PhD His thesis proposal was a library thesis, which foreshadowed his later theoretical work. He conducted fieldwork at Acoma Pueblo, New Mexico.

In 1927 White began teaching at the University at Buffalo.

==Buffalo transition==
Teaching at University of Buffalo marked a turning point in White&#x27;s thinking. White developed an interest in Marxism in 1929, he visited the Soviet Union and on his return joined the Socialist Labor Party, writing articles under the pseudonym &quot;John Steel&quot; for their newspaper.

White went to Michigan when he was hired to replace Julian Steward, who departed Ann Arbor in 1930. Although the university was home to a museum with a long history of involvement in matters anthropological, White was the only professor in the anthropology department itself. He remained here for the rest of his active career. In 1932, he headed a field school in the southwest which was attended by Fred Eggan, Mischa Titiev, and others.

White brought Titiev, his student and a Russian immigrant, to Michigan as a second professor in 1936. However, during the Second World War, Titiev took part in the war effort by studying Japan. Perhaps this upset the socialist White. In any case by war&#x27;s end White had broken with Titiev, who would go on to found the East Asian Studies Program, and the two were hardly even on speaking terms. No other faculty members were hired until after the war, when scholars like Richard K. Beardsley joined the department. Most would fall on one side or the other of the split between White and Titiev.

As a professor in Ann Arbor, White trained students such as Robert Carneiro, Beth Dillingham, and Gertrude Dole who carried on White&#x27;s program in its orthodox form, while other scholars such as Eric Wolf, Arthur Jelinek, Elman Service, and Marshall Sahlins and Napoleon Chagnon drew on their time with White to elaborate their own forms of anthropology.

==White&#x27;s anthropology==
Over time, White&#x27;s views became framed in opposition to that of Boasians, with whom he was institutionally at odds. This could take on personal overtones: White referred to Boas&#x27;s prose style as &quot;corny&quot; in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;. Robert Lowie, a proponent of Boas&#x27;s work, referred to White&#x27;s work as &quot;a farrago of immature metaphysical notions&quot;, shaped by &quot;the obsessive power of fanaticism [which] unconsciously warps one&#x27;s vision.&quot;

One of White&#x27;s strongest deviations from Boas&#x27;s philosophy was a view of the nature of anthropology and its relation to other sciences. White understood the world to be divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomena. Such a division is a reflection of the composition of the universe and was not a heuristic device. Thus, contrary to Alfred L. Kroeber, Kluckhohn, and Edward Sapir, White saw the delineation of the object of study not as a cognitive accomplishment of the anthropologist, but as a recognition of the actually existing and delineated phenomena which comprise the world. The distinction between &#x27;natural&#x27; and &#x27;social&#x27; sciences was thus based not on method, but on the nature of the object of study: physicists study physical phenomena, biologists biological phenomena, and culturologists (White&#x27;s term) cultural phenomena.

The object of study was not delineated by the researcher&#x27;s viewpoint or interest, but the method by which he approached them could be. White believed that phenomena could be explored from three different points of view: the historical, the formal-functional, and the evolutionist (or formal-temporal). The historical view was dedicated to examining the particular cultural processes, &quot;lovingly trying to penetrate into its secrets until every feature is plain and clear.&quot; The formal-functional is essentially the approach advocated by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown and Bronisław Malinowski, attempting to discern the formal structure of a society and the functional interrelations of its components. The evolutionist approach is, like the formal approach, generalizing; but it is also diachronic, seeing particular events as general instances of larger trends.

Boas claimed his science promised complex and interdependent visions of culture, but White thought that it would delegitimize anthropology if it became the dominant position, removing it from broader discourses on science. White viewed his own approach as a synthesis of historical and functional approach because it combined the diachronic scope of one with the generalizing eye for formal interrelations provided by the other. As such, it could point out &quot;the course of cultural development in the past and its probable course in the future&quot; a task that was anthropology&#x27;s &quot;most valuable function&quot;.

This stance can be seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While it can be argued that White&#x27;s exposition of Morgan and Spencer&#x27;s was tendentious, it can be safely said that White&#x27;s concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.

For White, culture was a superorganic entity that was sui generis and could be explained only in terms of itself. It was composed of three levels: the technological, the social organizational, and the ideological. Each level rested on the previous one, and although they all interacted, ultimately the technological level was the determining one, what White calls &quot;The hero of our piece&quot; and &quot;the leading character of our play&quot;. The most important factor in his theory is technology: &quot;Social systems are determined by technological systems&quot;, wrote White in his book, echoing the earlier theory of Lewis Henry Morgan.

White spoke of culture as a general human phenomenon and claimed not to speak of &#x27;cultures&#x27; in the plural. His theory, published in 1959 in &quot;The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome&quot;, rekindled the interest in social evolutionism and is counted prominently among the neoevolutionists. He believed that culture–meaning the total of all human cultural activity on the planet–was evolving. White differentiated three components of culture: technological, sociological, and ideological. He argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution. His materialist approach is evident in the following quote: &quot;man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment.&quot; This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical, and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques. White&#x27;s argument on the importance of technology goes as follows:
# Technology is an attempt to solve the problems of survival.
# This attempt ultimately means capturing enough energy and diverting it for human needs.
# Societies that capture more energy and use it more efficiently have an advantage over other societies.
# Therefore, these different societies are more advanced in an evolutionary sense.
For White &quot;the primary function of culture&quot; and the one that determines its level of advancement is its ability to &quot;harness and control energy.&quot; White&#x27;s law states that the measure by which to judge the relative degree of evolvedness of culture was the amount of energy it could capture (energy consumption).

White differentiates between five stages of human development. At first, people use the energy of their own muscles. Second, they use the energy of domesticated animals. Third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here). Fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. Fifth, they harness nuclear energy. White introduced a formula,

:&quot;P&quot; = &quot;ET&quot;,

where &quot;E&quot; is a measure of energy consumed per capita per year, &quot;T&quot; is the measure of efficiency in using energy harnessed, and &quot;P&quot; represents the degree of cultural development in terms of product produced. In his own words: &quot;&quot;the basic law of cultural evolution&quot; was &quot;culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased&quot;&quot;. Therefore, &quot;we find that progress and development are effected by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed&quot;. Although White stops short of promising that technology is the panacea for all the problems that affect mankind, like technological utopians do, his theory treats the technological factor as the most important factor in the evolution of society and is similar to ideas in the later works of Gerhard Lenski, the theory of the Kardashev scale, and some notions of technological singularity.

<doc id="1043143" wikidata="Q1021512" url="?curid=1043143" title="Single-payer healthcare">
<text>Single-payer healthcare is a type of universal healthcare, in which the costs of essential healthcare for all residents are covered by a single public system (hence &quot;single-payer&quot;). Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations (as is the case in Canada) or may own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as is the case in the United Kingdom). &quot;Single-payer&quot; describes the mechanism by which healthcare is paid for by a single public authority, not a private authority, nor a mix of both.

==Description==
Within single-payer healthcare systems, a single government or government-related source pays for all covered healthcare services. Governments use this strategy to achieve several goals, including universal healthcare, decreased economic burden of health care, and improved health outcomes for the population. In 2010, the World Health Organization&#x27;s member countries adopted universal healthcare as a goal; this goal was also adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

A single-payer health system establishes a single risk pool, consisting of the entire population of a geographic or political region. It also establishes a single set of rules for services offered, reimbursement rates, drug prices, and minimum standards for required services.

In wealthy nations, single-payer healthcare is typically available to all citizens and legal residents. Examples include the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service, Australia&#x27;s Medicare, Canada&#x27;s Medicare, Spain&#x27;s National Health System, Taiwan&#x27;s National Health Insurance and Italy&#x27;s National Medical System (SSN Servizio Sanitario Nazionale).

===History of the term===
The term was coined in the 1990s to characterize the differences between the Canadian healthcare system with those such as the United Kingdom&#x27;s NHS. In the Canadian healthcare system, the government pays private agencies to provide healthcare for qualifying individuals. In other systems, the government both funds and delivers care.

Typically, &quot;single-payer healthcare&quot; refers to health insurance provided as a public service and offered to citizens and legal residents; it does not usually refer to delivery of healthcare services. The fund can be managed by the government directly or as a publicly owned and regulated agency. Single-payer contrasts with other funding mechanisms like &quot;multi-payer&quot; (multiple public and/or private sources), &quot;two-tiered&quot; (defined either as a public source with the option to use qualifying private coverage as a substitute, or as a public source for catastrophic care backed by private insurance for common medical care), and &quot;insurance mandate&quot; (citizens are required to buy private insurance which meets a national standard and which is generally subsidized). Some systems combine elements of these four funding mechanisms.

In contrast to the standard usage of the term, some writers describe all publicly administered systems as &quot;single-payer plans&quot;, and others have described any system of healthcare which intends to cover the entire population, such as voucher plans, as &quot;single-payer plans&quot;, although these usages generally do not meet strict definitions of the term.

==Regions with single-payer systems==

Several nations worldwide have single-payer health insurance programs. These programs generally provide some form of universal health care, which is implemented in a variety of ways. In some cases doctors are employed and hospitals are run by the government, such as in the UK or Spain. Alternatively, the government may purchase healthcare services from outside organizations, such as the approach taken in Canada.

===Canada===

Healthcare in Canada is delivered through a publicly funded health care system, which is mostly free at the point of use and has most services provided by private entities. The system was established by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984. The government assures the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect any information about an individual&#x27;s health, which remains confidential between a person and their physician.

Canada&#x27;s provincially based Medicare systems are cost-effective partly because of their administrative simplicity. In each province, every doctor handles the insurance claim against the provincial insurer. There is no need for the person who accesses healthcare to be involved in billing and reclaim.

In general, costs are paid through funding from income taxes. A health card is issued by the Provincial Ministry of Health to each individual who enrolls for the program and everyone receives the same level of care.

There is no need for a variety of plans because virtually all essential basic care is covered, including maternity and infertility problems. Depending on the province, dental and vision care may not be covered but are often insured by employers through private companies. In some provinces, private supplemental plans are available for those who desire private rooms if they are hospitalized.

Cosmetic surgery and some forms of elective surgery are not considered essential care and are generally not covered. These can be paid out-of-pocket or through private insurers. Health coverage is not affected by loss or change of jobs, and there are no lifetime limits or exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

Pharmaceutical medications are covered by public funds, privately out-of-pocket or through employment-based private insurance. Drug prices are negotiated with suppliers by the federal government to control costs.

Family physicians (often known as general practitioners or GPs in Canada) are chosen by individuals. If a patient wishes to see a specialist or is counseled to see a specialist, a referral can be made by a GP.

Canadians do wait for some treatments and diagnostic services. The median wait time for diagnostic services such as MRI and CAT scans is two weeks, with 86.4% waiting less than three months. The median wait time for surgery is four weeks, with 82.2% waiting less than three months.

While physician income initially boomed after the implementation of a single-payer program, a reduction in physician salaries followed, which many feared would be a long-term result of government-run healthcare. However, by the beginning of the 21st century, medical professionals were again among Canada&#x27;s top earners.

===Taiwan===
Healthcare in Taiwan is administered by the Department of Health of the Executive Yuan. As with other developed economies, Taiwanese people are well-nourished but face such health problems as chronic obesity and heart disease.

In 2002, Taiwan had nearly 1.6 physicians and 5.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population, and there were a total of 36 hospitals and 2,601 clinics in the island. Health expenditures constituted 5.8% of the GDP in 2001, 64.9% of which coming from public funds.

Despite the initial shock on Taiwan&#x27;s economy from increased costs of expanded healthcare coverage, the single-payer system has provided protection from greater financial risks and has made healthcare more financially accessible for the population, resulting in a steady 70% public satisfaction rating.

The current healthcare system in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care funds. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.

NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many healthcare providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government.

In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002. Taiwan&#x27;s success with a single-payer health insurance program is owed, in part, to the country&#x27;s human resources and the government&#x27;s organizational skills, allowing for the effective and efficient management of the government-run health insurance program.

===South Korea===
South Korea used to have a multipayer social health insurance universal healthcare system, similar to systems used in countries like Japan and Germany, with healthcare societies providing coverage for the whole populace. Prior to 1977, the country had voluntary private health insurance, but reforms initiated in 1977 resulted in universal coverage by 1989. A major healthcare financing reform in 2000 merged all medical societies into the National Health Insurance Service. This new service became a single-payer healthcare system in 2004.

==Regions with &quot;Beveridge Model&quot; systems==
===Nordic countries===

The Nordic countries are sometimes considered to have single-payer health care services, as opposed to single-payer national health care insurance like Taiwan or Canada. This is a form of the &quot;Beveridge Model&quot; of health care systems that features public health providers in addition to public health insurance.

The term &quot;Scandinavian model&quot; or &quot;Nordic model&quot; of health care systems has a few common features: largely public providers, limited private health coverage, and regionally-run, devolved systems with limited involvement from the central government. Due to this third characteristic, they can also be argued to be single-payer only on a regional level, or to be multi-payer systems, as opposed to the nationally run health coverage found in Taiwan and South Korea.

===United Kingdom===

Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, meaning that England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all have their own system of private and publicly funded healthcare, generally referred to as the National Health Service (NHS). With largely public or government-owned providers, this also fits into the &quot;Beveridge Model&quot; of health care systems, sometimes considered to be single-payer, with relatively little private involvement compared to other universal systems. Each country&#x27;s having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems. That said, each country provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of use, being paid for from general taxation.

In addition, each also has a private sector which is considerably smaller than its public equivalent, with provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as HIV/AIDS.

The individual systems are:
* England: National Health Service (NHS)
* Scotland: NHS Scotland
* Wales: NHS Wales
* Northern Ireland: Health and Social Care (HSC)
In England, funding from general taxation is channeled through NHS England, which is responsible for commissioning mainly specialist services and primary care, and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which manage 60% of the budget and are responsible for commissioning health services for their local populations.

These commissioning bodies do not provide services themselves directly, but procure these from NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts, as well as private, voluntary, and social enterprise sector providers.

==Regions with hybrid single-payer/private insurance systems==

===Australia===

Healthcare in Australia is provided by both private and government institutions. Medicare is the publicly funded universal health care venture in Australia. It was instituted in 1984 and coexists with a private health system. For example, Medicare covers all of the cost for an Australian citizen in a public hospital, while it only covers 75% of the cost in a private hospital. Medicare is funded partly by a 2% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance.

As well as Medicare, there is a separate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that considerably subsidises a range of prescription medications. The Minister for Health administers national health policy, elements of which (such as the operation of hospitals) are overseen by individual states.

===India===

India has a universal multi-payer health care model that is paid for by a combination of public and private health insurances along with the element of almost entirely tax-funded public hospitals. The public hospital system is essentially free for all Indian residents except for small, often symbolic co-payments in some services. At the federal level, a national health insurance program was launched in 2018 by the Government of India, called Ayushman Bharat. This aimed to cover the bottom 50% (500 million people) of the country&#x27;s population working in the unorganized sector (enterprises having less than 10 employees) and offers them free treatment even at private hospitals. For people working in the organized sector (enterprises with more than 10 employees) and earning a monthly salary of up to Rs 21000 are covered by the social insurance scheme of Employees&#x27; State Insurance which entirely funds their healthcare (along with pension and unemployment benefits), both in public and private hospitals. People earning more than that amount are provided health insurance coverage by their employers through the many public or private insurance companies. As of 2020, 300 million Indians are covered by insurance bought from one of the public or private insurance companies by their employers as group or individual plans. Unemployed people without coverage are covered by the various state insurance schemes if they do not have the means to pay for it.

In 2019, the total net government spending on healthcare was $36 billion or 1.23% of its GDP. Since the country&#x27;s independence, the public hospital system has been entirely funded through general taxation.

===Israel===

Healthcare in Israel is universal and participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory. All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right. The Israeli healthcare system is based on the National Health Insurance Law of 1995, which mandates all citizens who are residents of the country to join one of four official health insurance organizations, known as Kupat Holim (קופת חולים - &quot;Sick Funds&quot;) which are run as not-for-profit organizations and are prohibited by law from denying any Israeli resident membership. Israelis can increase their medical coverage and improve their options by purchasing private health insurance. In a survey of 48 countries in 2013, Israel&#x27;s health system was ranked fourth in the world in terms of efficiency, and in 2014 it ranked seventh out of 51. In 2020, Israel&#x27;s health system was ranked third most efficient in the world. In 2015, Israel was ranked sixth-healthiest country in the world by Bloomberg rankings and ranked eighth in terms of life expectancy.

===Spain===

Building upon less structured foundations, in 1963 the existence of a single-payer healthcare system in Spain was established by the Spanish government. The system was sustained by contributions from workers, and covered them and their dependants.

The universality of the system was established later in 1986. At the same time, management of public healthcare was delegated to the different autonomous communities in the country. While previously this was not the case, in 1997 it was established that public authorities can delegate management of publicly funded healthcare to private companies.

Additionally, in parallel to the single-payer healthcare system there are private insurers, which provide coverage for some private doctors and hospitals. Employers will sometimes offer private health insurance as a benefit, with 14.8% of the Spanish population being covered under private health insurance in 2013.

In 2000, the Spanish healthcare system was rated by the World Health Organization as the 7th best in the world.

Spain&#x27;s healthcare system ranks 19th in Europe according to the 2018 Euro health consumer index.

===United States===

Medicare in the United States is a public healthcare system, but is restricted to persons age 65 and older, people under 65 who have specific disabilities, and anyone with end-stage renal disease. A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States, among them the Medicare for All Act originally introduced in the House in February 2003 and repeatedly since. On July 18, 2018, it was announced that over 60 U.S. House Democrats would be forming a Medicare for All Caucus. On March 17, 2021, exactly a year after COVID-19 had appeared in every U.S. state, House Democrats introduced the Medicare for All Act of 2021 with 112 supporters.

Advocates argue that preventive healthcare expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year because publicly funded universal healthcare would benefit employers and consumers, that employers would benefit from a bigger pool of potential customers and that employers would likely pay less, would be spared administrative costs, and inequities between employers would be reduced. Prohibitively high cost is the primary reason Americans give for problems accessing health care. At over 27 million, the number of people without health insurance coverage in the United States is one of the primary concerns raised by advocates of health care reform. Lack of health insurance is associated with increased mortality – about sixty thousand preventable deaths per year, depending on the study. A study done at Harvard Medical School with Cambridge Health Alliance showed that nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with a lack of patient health insurance. The study also found that uninsured, working Americans have a risk of death about 40% higher compared to privately insured working Americans.

Backers of single-payer or Medicare for All note that minorities and the poor, as well as rural residents in general, are less able to afford private health insurance, and that those who can must pay high deductibles and co-payments that threaten families with financial ruin. Advocates have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to the extended preventive health care, although estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; have found that preventive care is more expensive due to increased utilization.

Any national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but advocates also believe savings would be realized through preventive care and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs. A 2008 analysis of a single-payer bill by Physicians for a National Health Program estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year. The Commonwealth Fund believes that, if the United States adopted a universal health care system, the mortality rate would improve and the country would save approximately $570 billion a year.

====National policies and proposals====
Government is increasingly involved in U.S. health care spending, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on individuals&#x27; medical care in 2004. However, studies have shown that the publicly administered share of health spending in the U.S. may be closer to 60% as of 2002.

According to Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt, U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) represent &quot;forms of &#x27;social insurance&#x27; coupled with a largely private health-care delivery system&quot; rather than forms of &quot;socialized medicine&quot;. In contrast, he describes the Veterans Administration healthcare system as a pure form of socialized medicine because it is &quot;owned, operated and financed by government.&quot;

In a peer-reviewed paper published in the &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot;, researchers of the RAND Corporation reported that the quality of care received by Veterans Administration patients scored significantly higher overall than did comparable metrics for patients currently using United States Medicare.

The Medicare for All Act is a perennial piece of legislation introduced many times in the United States House of Representatives by then Representative John Conyers (D-MI). The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada&#x27;s Medicare, the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service, and Taiwan&#x27;s Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. The bill was first introduced in 2003 and has been reintroduced in each Congress since. During the 2009 health care debates over the bill that became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 676 was expected to be debated and voted upon by the House in September 2009, but was never debated. In the wake of Bernie Sanders&#x27; 2016 presidential campaign, in which a push for universal healthcare featured prominently, single-payer proposals gained traction. Conyers reintroduced his bill in the House of Representatives in January 2017. Four months later, the bill was supported by 112 co-sponsors, surpassing for the first time the 25% mark of co-sponsorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;hr676/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year, Sanders himself, together with 16 co-sponsors, introduced a Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate (S. 1804).

An analysis of a Mercatus Center study of the 2017 proposal by economist Jeffrey Sachs found that &quot;it rightfully and straightforwardly concludes that M4A would provide more health care coverage at lower cost than the status quo, projecting a net reduction in national health expenditures of roughly $2 trillion over a 10-year period (2022-2031), while also enabling increased health care coverage.&quot; However, Mercatus scholar Robert Graboyes pointed out that the study had deliberately taken for granted the assumptions of the bill’s advocates for the sake of argument: “If M4A yielded every benefit and saving Sanders foresees, how would federal government finances change?” He went on: “Sanders assumes we can slam doctors, nurses, hospitals, drug companies, and others with enormous pay cuts, and yet expect them to happily provide even more services and products than they do now. He also assumes federal bureaucrats … will be paragons of efficient management.“

The Congressional Budget Office and related government agencies scored the cost of a single-payer health care system several times since 1991. The Government Accountability Office published a report in 1991 noting that &quot;[I]f the US were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer, as in Canada, the savings in administrative costs [10 percent of health spending] would be more than enough to offset the expense of universal coverage.&quot;

The CBO scored the cost in 1991, noting that &quot;the population that is currently uninsured could be covered without dramatically increasing national spending on health&quot; and that &quot;all US residents might be covered by health insurance for roughly the current level of spending or even somewhat less, because of savings in administrative costs and lower payment rates for services used by the privately insured.&quot;

A CBO report in 1993 stated that &quot;[t]he net cost of achieving universal insurance coverage under this single payer system would be negative&quot; in part because &quot;consumer payments for health would fall by $1,118 per capita, but taxes would have to increase by $1,261 per capita&quot; in order to pay for the plan. A July 1993 scoring also resulted in positive outcomes, with the CBO stating that, &quot;[a]s the program was phased in, the administrative savings from switching to a single-payer system would offset much of the increased demand for health care services.

Later, the cap on the growth of the national health budget would hold the rate of growth of spending below the baseline.&quot; The CBO also scored Sen. Paul Wellstone&#x27;s American Health and Security Act of 1993 in December 1993, finding that &quot;by year five (and in subsequent years) the new system would cost less than baseline.&quot;

A 2014 study published in the journal BMC Medical Services Research by James Kahn, et al., found that the actual administrative burden of health care in the United States was 27% of all national health expenditures. The study examined both direct costs charged by insurers for profit, administration and marketing but also the indirect burden placed on health care providers like hospitals, nursing homes and doctors for costs they incurred in working with private health insurers including contract negotiations, financial and clinical record-keeping (variable and idiosyncratic for each payer).

Kahn, et al. estimate that the added cost for the private insurer health system in the US was about $471 billion in 2012 compared to a single-payer system like Canada&#x27;s. This represents just over 20% of the total national healthcare expenditure in 2012. Kahn asserts that this excess administrative cost will increase under the Affordable Care Act with its reliance on the provision of health coverage through a multi-payer system.

A February 2020 study published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; found that the proposed Medicare for All Act would save 68,000 lives and $450 billion in national healthcare expenditure annually. According to a 2022 study published in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot;, a single payer universal healthcare system would have saved 212,000 lives and averted over $100 billion in medical costs during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020 alone. Roughly 16% of all COVID-19 deaths occurred in the US, despite having only 4% of the world&#x27;s population.

====State proposals====
Several single-payer state referendums and bills from state legislatures have been proposed, but with the exception of Vermont, all have failed. In December 2014, Vermont canceled its plan for single-payer health care.

=====California=====
California attempted passage of a single-payer health system by initiative in 1994, as Proposition 186, which got 27% of the vote.

Multiple legislative proposals have been proposed in the state legislature, one of the earliest by Senator Nicholas Petris. The first successful passage of legislation through the California State Legislature, SB 840 or &quot;The California Universal Healthcare Act&quot; (authored by Sheila Kuehl), occurred in 2006 and again in 2008. Both times, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill. State Senator Mark Leno has reintroduced the bill in the legislative session afterwards.

On February 17, 2017, SB 562, which is also known as &quot;The Healthy California Act&quot; was introduced to the California State Senate. This bill is a $400 billion plan that was sponsored by the California Nurses Association to implement single-payer healthcare in California. Under this bill, which was co-authored by State Senators Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), Californians would have health coverage without having to pay any premiums, co-pays, or deductibles. Under this proposed bill, all California residents will be covered in the Healthy California Act SB 562 regardless of their immigration status. This bill will also include transient students that attend California institutions who purchased their healthcare program through the school. Services that will be covered by this bill will need to be determined as medically necessary by the patient&#x27;s chosen health care provider. These services will range from preventive services to emergency services, in addition to prescription drugs services. SB 562 passed in the State Senate on June 1, 2017, with a vote of 23–14. When the bill was sent to the State Assembly, it was put on hold by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, who expressed concern over financing.

According to SB 562, a Healthy California Trust Fund would be established to provide funding for the bill. Currently, states receive funding from the federal government for certain healthcare services such as Medicaid and Medicare. In addition to taxes, these funds would be pooled into the new trust fund and provide the sources of funding needed to implement The Healthy California Act. However, California must first obtain a waiver from the federal government which would allow California to pool all the money received from these federal programs into one central fund. A new bill, AB 1400, proposed by Assemblymember Ash Kalra in 2021, would have established single-payer healthcare in California under the name of CalCare. The bill was ultimately withdrawn by Kalra before a floor vote could be held on it in January 2022 because AB 1400 did not have the votes to pass if one was to be held.

In 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed a &quot;Healthy California for All&quot; (HCFA) commission to study the feasibility of adopting a universal health care system with unified financing, such as a single-payer system, in California.

=====Colorado=====
The Colorado State Health Care System Initiative, Amendment 69, was a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment proposal in November 2016 to vote on a single-payer healthcare system called &quot;ColoradoCare&quot;. The system would have been funded by a 10% payroll tax split 2:1 between employers and employees. This would have replaced the private health insurance premiums currently paid by employees and companies. It would have begun operating in 2019 and was estimated to require revenue of $38 billion annually (from the Federal government and payroll taxes) and provide coverage for all residents, with no deductibles.

The ballot measure was rejected by 79% of voters.

=====Hawaii=====
In 2009, the Hawaii state legislature passed a single-payer healthcare bill that was vetoed by Republican Governor Linda Lingle. While the veto was overridden by the legislature, the bill was not implemented.

=====Illinois=====
In 2007, the Health Care for All Illinois Act was introduced and the Illinois House of Representatives&#x27; Health Availability Access Committee passed the single-payer bill favorably out of committee by an 8–4 vote. The legislation was eventually referred back to the House rules committee and not taken up again during that session.

=====Massachusetts=====
Massachusetts had passed a universal healthcare program in 1986, but budget constraints and partisan control of the legislature resulted in its repeal before the legislation could be enacted.

Question 4, a nonbinding referendum, was on the ballot in 14 state districts in November 2010, asking voters, &quot;[S]hall the representative from this district be instructed to support legislation that would establish healthcare as a human right regardless of age, state of health or employment status, by creating a single payer health insurance system like Medicare that is comprehensive, cost effective, and publicly provided to all residents of Massachusetts?&quot; The ballot question passed in all 14 districts that offered the question.

=====Maine=====
In June 2021 LD 1045 became law without the signature of Governor Janet Mills. The law would establish a board called the Maine Healthcare Board which would be tasked to design, implement, and maintain a state health insurance plan called the Maine Healthcare Plan which would cover all residents of the state of Maine. However, neither the board of the Maine Healthcare Plan have been created because they are contingent on the passage of the federal legislation H.R.3775, the State-Based Universal Health Care Act.

In 2020 Maine AllCare, a statewide chapter of Physicians for a National Health Program organized as a 501(c)(3), launched a 501(c)(4) called Maine Healthcare Action to run a statewide ballot initiative directing the legislature to establish a universal, publicly funded health care system that covers everyone in the state by 2024. The campaign needed 63,000 valid signatures from registered Maine voters to get on the 2022 ballot. The campaign was suspended in April 2022 after collecting more than 41,150 signatures from voters across all 16 counties in Maine. In a blogpost Maine Healthcare Action said the reason was that they were not on track to collect the needed signatures by the June deadline.

=====Minnesota=====
The Minnesota Health Act, which would establish a statewide single-payer health plan, has been presented to the Minnesota legislature regularly since 2009. The bill was passed out of both the Senate Health Housing and Family Security Committee and the Senate Commerce and Consumer Protection Committee in 2009, but the House version was ultimately tabled.

In 2010, the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a voice vote as well as the House Health Care &amp; Human Services Policy and Oversight Committee. In 2011, the bill was introduced as a two-year bill in both the Senate and House, but did not progress. It has been introduced again in the 2013 session in both chambers.

=====Montana=====
In September 2011, Governor Brian Schweitzer announced his intention to seek a waiver from the federal government allowing Montana to set up a single-payer healthcare system. Governor Schweitzer was unable to implement single-payer health care in Montana, but did make moves to open government-run clinics, and in his final budget as governor, increased coverage for lower-income Montana residents.

=====New York=====
New York State has been attempting passage of the New York Health Act, which would establish a statewide single-payer health plan, since 1992. The New York Health Act passed the Assembly four times: once in 1992 and again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, but has not yet advanced through the Senate after referrals to the Health Committee. On all occasions, the legislation passed the Assembly by an almost two-to-one ratio of support.

=====Oregon=====
The state of Oregon attempted to pass single-payer healthcare via Oregon Ballot Measure 23 in 2002, and the measure was rejected by a significant majority.

=====Pennsylvania=====
The Family Business and Healthcare Security Act has been introduced in the Pennsylvania legislature numerous times, but has never been able to pass.

=====Vermont=====

Vermont passed legislation in 2011 creating Green Mountain Care. When Governor Peter Shumlin signed the bill into law, Vermont became the first state to functionally have a single-payer health care system. While the bill is considered a single-payer bill, private insurers can continue to operate in the state indefinitely, meaning it does not fit the strict definition of single-payer.

Representative Mark Larson, the initial sponsor of the bill, has described Green Mountain Care&#x27;s provisions &quot;as close as we can get [to single-payer] at the state level.&quot; Vermont abandoned the plan in 2014, citing costs and tax increases as too high to implement.

=====Washington=====
There have been multiple campaigns for statewide single payer in Washington state. In 2018 a 501(c)(4) called Whole Washington ran an initiative to the people (I-1600) for a statewide single payer plan called the Whole Washington Health Trust - they did not collect enough signatures to make it onto the ballot. Washington has also passed legislation to create a universal healthcare work group that is tasked with creating a statewide universal healthcare plan by 2026. In 2021, Senate Bill 5204, a legislative version of Whole Washington&#x27;s ballot initiative, was introduced into the state legislature by Senator Bob Hasegawa. It has seven cosponsors, though it has never been introduced into the Washington House of Representatives.

====Public opinion====
Advocates for single-payer healthcare point out support in polls, although the polling is mixed depending on how the question is asked. Polls from Harvard University in 1988, the Los Angeles Times in 1990, and the Wall Street Journal in 1991 all showed strong support for a health care system comparable to the system in Canada.

A 2001 article in the public health journal &quot;Health Affairs&quot; studied fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a &quot;national health care plan&quot;, poll respondents &quot;remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right, and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan.&quot;

Between 2001 and 2013, however, polling support declined. A 2007 Yahoo/AP poll showed 54% of respondents considered themselves supporters of &quot;single-payer health care&quot;, and 49% of respondents in a 2009 poll for &quot;Time&quot; magazine showed support for &quot;a national single-payer plan similar to Medicare for all.&quot; Polls by Rasmussen Reports in 2011 and 2012 showed 49% opposed to single-payer healthcare. In April 2019, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll showed 56% of Americans favor &quot;a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all&quot;, with support remaining steady over the previous two years.

A majority of Democratic Party voters support Medicare for all. From 2010 to 2020, all House members who supported Medicare for All won reelection including those in Republican-leaning districts.

====Advocacy groups====
Physicians for a National Health Program, National Nurses United, the American Medical Student Association, Healthcare-NOW!, Public Citizen, and the California Nurses Association are among advocacy groups that have called for the introduction of a single-payer healthcare program in the United States.

A 2007 study published in the &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; found that 59% of physicians &quot;supported legislation to establish national health insurance&quot; while 9% were neutral on the topic, and 32% opposed it. In January 2020, The American College of Physicians endorsed the concept of single-payer system for the US and published a series of articles supporting this in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

<text>The [[General Motors]] Ultralite was a 1992 low emission vehicle concept car intended to demonstrate the benefits of advanced materials and low fuel consumption.

It was rated at by the EPA, but could achieve at a steady state cruising speed of 50 mph.

The carbon fiber shell was fabricated by Scaled Composites and it weighed only 420 pounds (191 kg). The total weight of the car was 1,400 pounds (635 kg).

The car had gull-wing doors and no B-pillar. The drag coefficient, Cd, was 0.19, significantly lower than that of production cars of the decade.

Its three-cylinder 1.5 L two-stroke engine could produce 111 hp (83 kW), which made a speed of 135 mph (217 km/h) possible. The car could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in less than eight seconds.

The shape was reminiscent of the Ford Probe concept, and the Ultralite presaged the production General Motors EV1 electric vehicle and other production models.

==In popular culture==
Due to the unusual design, the Ultralite has been featured in several science fiction productions, most prominently among them was in the 1993 film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; as the squad cars used by the fictional SAPD (San Angeles Police Department). They also appeared in the second episode of the second season of &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, and in the 1999 movie &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;.

<doc id="1043159" wikidata="Q1470118" url="?curid=1043159" title="Professor's Cube">
<text>The Professor&#x27;s Cube (also known as the 5×5×5 Rubik&#x27;s Cube and many other names, depending on manufacturer) is a 5×5×5 version of the original Rubik&#x27;s Cube. It has qualities in common with both the 3×3×3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube and the 4×4×4 Rubik&#x27;s Revenge, and solution strategies for both can be applied.

==History==
The Professor&#x27;s Cube was invented by Udo Krell in 1981. Out of the many designs that were proposed, Udo Krell&#x27;s design was the first 5×5×5 design that was manufactured and sold. Uwe Mèffert manufactured the cube and sold it in Hong Kong in 1983.

Ideal Toys, who first popularized the original 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s cube, marketed the puzzle in Germany as the &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Wahn&quot; (German: &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Craze&quot;). When the cube was marketed in Japan, it was marketed under the name &quot;Professor&#x27;s Cube&quot;. Mèffert reissued the cube under the name &quot;Professor&#x27;s Cube&quot; in the 1990s.

The early versions of the 5×5×5 cube sold at Barnes &amp; Noble were marketed under the name &quot;Professor&#x27;s Cube&quot; but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called &quot;5×5 Cube.&quot; Mefferts.com used to sell a limited edition version of the 5×5×5 cube called the Professor&#x27;s Cube. This version had colored tiles rather than stickers. Verdes Innovations sells a version called the V-Cube 5.

==Workings==
The original Professor&#x27;s Cube design by Udo Krell works by using an expanded 3×3×3 cube as a mantle with the center edge pieces and corners sticking out from the spherical center of identical mechanism to the 3×3×3 cube. All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3×3×3, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.

The Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.

The V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and created what was arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle available at that time. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow speedcubing. Most current production 5×5×5 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes&#x27; patent.
==Stability and durability==

The original Professor&#x27;s Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3×3×3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts and pieces. Because of its fragile design, the Rubik&#x27;s brand Professor&#x27;s Cube is not suitable for Speedcubing. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces. Both the Eastsheen 5×5×5 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.

==Permutations==
There are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).

Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving 8! possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth corner depends on the other seven, giving 37 (or 2,187) combinations.

There are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(246) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 4! (or 24) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the product of the permutations of the two sets, 24!2/(2412).

The 24 outer edges cannot be flipped due to the interior shape of those pieces. Corresponding outer edges are distinguishable, since the pieces are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 × 211 or 12! × 210 possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! × 12! × 210 possibilities for the inner and outer edges together.

This gives a total number of permutations of
:formula_1

The full number is precisely 282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000 possible permutations (about 283 duodecillion on the long scale or 283 trevigintillion on the short scale).

Some variations of the cube have one of the center pieces marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13×1075, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated at 1080. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all center pieces visible. An example of this is shown below.

==Solutions==
Speedcubers usually favor the Reduction method which groups the centers into one-colored blocks and grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips. This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3×3×3 cube, just a stretched out version. As illustrated to the right, the fixed centers, middle edges and corners can be treated as equivalent to a 3×3×3 cube. As a result, once reduction is complete the parity errors sometimes seen on the 4×4×4 cannot occur on the 5×5×5, or any cube with an odd number of layers.

The Yau5 method is named after its proposer, Robert Yau. The method starts by solving the opposite centers (preferably white and yellow), then solving three cross edges (preferably white). Next, the remaining centers and last cross edge are solved. The last cross edge and the remaining unsolved edges are solved, and then it can be solved like a 3x3x3.

Another frequently used strategy is to solve the edges and corners of the cube first, and the centers last. This method is referred to as the Cage method, so called because the centers appear to be in a cage after the solving of edges and corners. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4×4×4 cube.

A less frequently used strategy is to solve one side and one layer first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th layer, and finally the last side and layer. This method is referred to as Layer-by-Layer. This resembles CFOP, a well known technique used for the 3x3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube, with 2 added layers and a couple of centers.

ABCube Method is a direct solve method originated by Sunshine Workman in 2020. It is geared to complete beginners and non-cubers. It is similar in order of operation to the Cage Method, but differs functionally in that it is mostly visual and eliminates the standardized notation. It works on all complexity of cubes, from 2x2x2 through big cubes (nxnxn) and only utilizes two easy to remember algorithms; one four twists, the other eight twists, and it eliminates long parity algorithms.

==World records==
The world record for fastest 5×5×5 solve is 30.45 seconds, set by Tymon Kolasinski of Poland on November 4, 2024, at Rubik&#x27;s WCA Asian Championship 2024, in Putrajaya, Malaysia. 
The world record for fastest average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest solves) is 34.76 seconds, set by Max Park of the United States on July 18, 2024, at NAC 2024, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the times of (39.71) 35.10 (33.55) 35.44, and 33.75 

The record fastest time for solving a 5×5×5 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 4.41 seconds (including inspection), set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on November 10, 2023, at Virginia Championship 2023 in Richmond, Virginia.

The record for mean of three solves solving a 5x5x5 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 27.63 seconds (including inspection), set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on December 15, 2019, with the times of 2:32.48, 2:28.80, and 2:21.62.

<text>Mbege is a kind of banana drink traditional to the Chagga ethnic group of Tanzania located in &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot; region. It is an alcoholic drink made from fermented bananas. The process of making of mbege is labor-intensive and time-consuming as the majority of the process is done by hand without the aid of modern technology. The initial taste of mbege is said to be sweet and is followed by a slightly sour aftertaste.

==Process==
The bananas are mashed and then cooked in a cooking pot over a fire for 6 hours. The product is then covered and left outside to ferment for up to 7 days. The fermented mixture is strained through shredded grass and banana leaves and a thick porridge made from the flour of finger millet and water is added to the strained liquid. A small amount of quinine-bark flour is then added to the mixture in order to tone down some of the sweetness of the bananas. It is then left to sit out for another day before it is ready to be consumed.

==In popular culture==
*The process of making mbege was featured on Travel Channel&#x27;s show Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern.

<doc id="1043187" wikidata="Q22970788" url="?curid=1043187" title="Bukit Timah">
<text>Bukit Timah ( ), often abbreviated as Bt Timah, is a planning area and residential estate located in the westernmost part of the Central Region of Singapore. Bukit Timah lies roughly from the Central Business District, bordering the Central Water Catchment to the north, Bukit Panjang to the northwest, Queenstown to the south, Tanglin to the southeast, Clementi to the southwest, Novena to the east and Bukit Batok to the west. It is further split into eight subzones, namely Anak Bukit, Coronation Road, Farrer Court, Hillcrest, Holland Road, Leedon Park, Swiss Club and Ulu Pandan.

Owing to its prime location, Bukit Timah has some of the densest clusters of luxury condominiums and landed property in the city, with very few public housing.

==Etymology==
The last identification of the area was on the 1828 map by Frankin and Jackson and was noted as Bukit Timah. As the interior of Singapore was not fully explored, it is likely the name came from the Malays.

In Malay, Bukit Timah meant &quot;Tin bearing hill&quot;. The original Malay name was &quot;Bukit Temak&quot;, meaning &quot;hill of the temak trees&quot; as the temak trees were abundant in the area. It was possible that the British in Singapore had mispronounced or misheard and became Bukit Timah.

==History==
Bukit Timah Road, was completed in 1843 to provide a link to the highest point of Singapore, the Bukit Timah Hill. The road was then extended northwards to Kranji in 1845, making it one of the earliest roads connecting the north to the south.

The Bukit Timah railway station (BRTS) was one of the five Singapore-Kranji railway stations opened in 1905, the first railway of Singapore. BRTS was decommissioned in July 2011 together with Tanjong Pagar railway station. Sections of the former railway station have been repurposed as a community space, and is now part of the Rail Corridor.

Bukit Timah was a major battleground during the final stages of the Japanese Invasion in 1942, where the Battle of Bukit Timah was fought. The battle resulted in the fall of Bukit Timah to the Japanese as British had failed to repel the invaders from the area.

Beauty World was formerly named &quot;Tai Tong Ah Sai Ka&quot;i which was founded as an amusement park during the Japanese Occupation. Following the end of occupation, Tai Tong Ah Sai Kai was renamed &quot;Beauty World&quot; in 1947 and reopened as a market. After being badly damaged by series of fires in the 1970s, Beauty World was acquired by the government and was redeveloped as a shopping centre, which opened in 1984.

==Infrastructure==
The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with high land value.

The Bukit Timah Race Course, a thoroughbred horse racing facility, was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999. The land has since been renovated, and is currently home to The Grandstand, which hosts several food outlets, childcare services and a Giant supermarket.

The nearby area hosts many bungalows, typically expensive in land-scarce Singapore, as well as high rise condominiums. Many expatriates and well-heeled Singaporeans live in this region. Its main attractions include popular eateries at Sixth Avenue, as well as Turf City.

This region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah (District 21) was formed.

=== Mass Rapid Transit ===
There are 7 MRT stations within the planning area, spanning 2 lines, the Downtown Line and Circle Line. Stage 2 of the Downtown MRT line train service started on 27 December 2015 and parallels the Bukit Timah Road. It connects Bukit Panjang in the North-Western edge of Bukit Timah to the city centre in the South. Both lines have an interchange station at Botanic Gardens MRT station. The 6 other stations are:

* Beauty World
* King Albert Park
* Sixth Avenue
* Tan Kah Kee
* Farrer Road
* Holland Village

<doc id="1043188" wikidata="Q2994749" url="?curid=1043188" title="Viceregal consort of Canada">
<text>The viceregal consort of Canada is the spouse of the serving governor general of Canada, assisting the viceroy with ceremonial and charitable work, accompanying him or her to official state occasions, and occasionally undertaking philanthropic work of their own. As the host/hostess of the royal and viceroyal residence in Ottawa, the consort, if female, is also known as the &quot;chatelaine of Rideau Hall&quot;. This individual, who ranks third in the Canadian order of precedence, after the Canadian monarch and the governor general, is addressed as &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Excellency&quot; while their spouse is in office, and is made &quot;ex officio&quot; an Extraordinary Companion () of the Order of Canada and a Knight or Dame of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem.

The present viceregal consort is Whit Fraser, the husband of Governor General Mary Simon, who took office on July 26, 2021.

==Role==

The position of the viceregal consort carries no official duties and receives no salary. However, consorts have held and do hold a prominent and visible position in the Canadian affairs of state, taking part in official occasions, such as the speech from the throne and Order of Canada investitures, and national celebrations, such as Canada Day events on Parliament Hill, as well as both welcoming foreign dignitaries to Canada and accompanying the governor general on state visits abroad. These practices evolved from the original role as the hostess of the royal and viceroyal residences in Ottawa (Rideau Hall) and Quebec City (La Citadelle), a tradition maintained only by female viceregal consorts, who oversee the planning of ceremonies and functions of state that take place at either of the official residences.

Over the course of the 20th century, it became increasingly common for viceregal consorts to select and pursue on their own initiative various charitable projects. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, whose husband served as governor general during the Second World War, volunteered her time to the war effort in Canada, especially women&#x27;s organisations such as the Royal Canadian Air Force Women&#x27;s Division. The activities chosen are typically apolitical and non-divisive. However, some consorts have stirred controversy through their work; Jean-Daniel Lafond, who promoted Canadian art—film in particular—and involved himself in the Francophone community, made a documentary while viceregal consort that attracted criticism from the &quot;National Post&quot; that Lafond had shown strong anti-Americanism and had been sympathetic to an admitted assassin.

Only once has the title of Chatelaine of Rideau Hall been held by someone who was not the spouse of the governor general—as Vincent Massey was a widower, his daughter-in-law, Lilias Massey, held the title and performed the official duties of the chatelaine. Unlike a viceregal consort, however, Lilias Massey was not addressed as &quot;Her Excellency&quot;.

<text>Getz/Gilberto is an album by American saxophonist Stan Getz and Brazilian guitarist João Gilberto, featuring pianist and composer Antônio Carlos Jobim (Tom Jobim), who also composed many of the tracks. It was released in March 1964 by Verve Records. The album features the vocals of Astrud Gilberto on two tracks, &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; (&quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;) and &quot;Corcovado&quot;. The artwork was done by artist Olga Albizu. &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; is a jazz and bossa nova album and includes tracks such as &quot;Desafinado&quot;, &quot;Corcovado&quot;, and &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot;. The last received a Grammy Award for Record of the Year and started Astrud Gilberto&#x27;s career. &quot;Doralice&quot; and &quot;Para Machucar Meu Coração&quot; strengthened Gilberto&#x27;s and Jobim&#x27;s respect for the tradition of pre-bossa nova samba.

&quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; is considered the record that popularized bossa nova worldwide and is one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time, selling over one million copies. It was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s and &quot;Vibe&quot;″s lists of best albums of all time. &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; was widely acclaimed by music critics, who praised Gilberto&#x27;s vocals and the album&#x27;s bossa nova groove and minimalism. &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; received Grammy Awards for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group and Best Engineered Recording - Non-Classical; it also became the first non-American album to win Album of the Year, in 1965.

==Background==

Bossa nova was introduced in 1958, with the song &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; (&quot;No More Blues&quot;), sung by Elizeth Cardoso on her album &quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot;. Arranged by Jobim and Gilberto, with lyrics by Vinícius de Moraes, the song received both praise and criticism for rhythmic and harmonic elements that were uncommon for samba. Gilberto played acoustic guitar on another track, &quot;Outra Vez&quot;, composed by Jobim. A few months later, Gilberto recorded his first single, &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;/&quot;Bim-Bom&quot;, the latter his composition. The single helped define &quot;música popular brasileira&quot;. This would lead to his debut album, &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; (1959).

Jazz was suffering a commercial and artistic crisis due to the popularity of rock and roll. In 1961, Tony Bennett made a trip to Brazil with bassist Don Payne, and both became familiar with modern Brazilian popular music. Payne took home numerous Brazilian records when he returned to United States; he then showed them to his friend and neighbor Stan Getz. Getz was excited about the sound of bossa nova and released two albums: &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; and &quot;Big Band Bossa Nova&quot;, both in 1962. Bossa nova became so popular that the title &quot;Big Band Bossa Nova&quot; was used for three other 1962 albums: by Quincy Jones, Oscar Castro-Neves, and Enoch Light.

&quot;Jazz Samba&quot; with Charlie Byrd sold a million copies and received positive reviews in United States. However, the record labels&#x27; rush to exploit the new Brazilian sound led to musicians introducing errors in melody and harmony in the music. For example, the sheet music of &quot;Desafinado&quot; as published in &quot;The New Real Book&quot; (1995)—a compilation of jazz and bossa nova songs—is the Charlie Byrd version from &quot;Jazz Samba&quot;, which contains many errors. There was a third Getz release, &quot;Jazz Samba Encore!&quot;, featuring Brazilian singer and guitarist Luiz Bonfá. The album sold well, but the &quot;trilogy&quot; did not satisfy the producers commercially to compete with Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin, Pat Boone, and Henry Mancini.

On November 21, 1962, the first North American concert of Bossa Nova – the New Brazilian Jazz – was presented at Carnegie Hall by João Gilberto, Tom Jobim, Bonfá, Roberto Menescal and Sérgio Mendes among others. According to critic Liliana Harb Bollos, the goal of this concert was to &quot;spread &quot;música popular brasileira&quot; in the capital of jazz&quot;. By this time bossa nova had declined in Brazil, but continued to enjoy popularity in other countries. After the Carnegie Hall concert, record producer Creed Taylor wanted Jobim and Gilberto to meet Getz for an &quot;historical documentation&quot; of the genre&#x27;s style. This happened in 1963 with &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, released five years after the birth of bossa nova in Brazil.

==Recording and composition==
The recording sessions commenced on March 18, 1963, at A &amp; R Recording Studios in New York City and were completed on the following day. Phil Ramone, who owned A &amp; R Recording Studios, was the album&#x27;s sound engineer. Produced by Creed Taylor, the album was released by Verve Records. The rhythm section backing Getz was Jobim on piano, Sebastião Neto on bass and Milton Banana on drums. (Neto was not credited after being hired by another record label, Audio Fidelity. As a result, the double bassist credited on &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; is Tommy Williams, Getz&#x27;s regular bassist. Williams, however, did not perform at the recording sessions.) 

Astrud Gilberto, who had never sung professionally before, was featured on two tracks, &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; and &quot;Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)&quot;. Like João Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto has a quiet, almost whispered vocal style which would become an important influence on female vocalists in bossa nova. On João Gilberto&#x27;s first three albums—&quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;, &quot;O Amor, o Sorriso e a Flor&quot; (1960) and &quot;João Gilberto&quot; (1961)—the vibrato in his voice is not entirely absent as it is on &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;.

Stylistic features of bossa nova such as restraint and lyrical objectivity are further developed in &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; building on Gilberto&#x27;s previous albums. Jobim&#x27;s piano performance is minimalist, contributing only what is needed. Besides playing piano, Jobim was also responsible for some of the arrangements and co-wrote nearly all of the songs except &quot;Doralice&quot; and &quot;Pra Machucar Meu Coração&quot;, both old sambas, which are more polished and serious in Gilberto&#x27;s version. All the other songs are compositions by Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes (&quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;, &quot;Só Danço Samba&quot; and &quot;O Grande Amor&quot;) and Jobim and Newton Mendonça (in &quot;Desafinado&quot;). &quot;Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)&quot; and &quot;Vivo Sonhando&quot; were composed solely by Jobim.

According to Ruy Castro, Gilberto and Getz often disagreed on which was the best take, leaving the choice to producer Creed Taylor. During one session, Gilberto, who did not speak English, and impatient with Getz&#x27;s rhythmic style, told Antônio Carlos Jobim: &quot;Tell this gringo he is an idiot&quot;. Jobim then translated: &quot;Stan, João is saying that his dream always was to record with you&quot;. Getz&#x27;s harder approach to the music did not please Gilberto who preferred a more delicate style. Due to these artistic differences, &quot;Getz/Gilberto #2&quot; features Getz and his quartet on side A, and Gilberto, by himself, on side B. In spite of the tension in the studio Gilberto would continue to collaborate with Getz. Twelve years after the release of &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; the pair reunited at the Keystone Korner club in San Francisco for a six-day engagement promoting their new album, &quot;The Best of Two Worlds&quot;.

Gene Lees wrote the English lyrics for &quot;Corcovado&quot;. Norman Gimbel, who wrote the English lyrics for &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot;, felt that the reference to &quot;Ipanema&quot; wouldn&#x27;t mean anything to Americans but Jobim insisted on keeping the reference to the beach. Producer Taylor shelved the project for nearly a year because he was afraid the record might be a commercial failure. As a consequence, &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; was finally released in March 1964.

==Artwork==
The artwork featured on the cover of the album is the work of Puerto Rican artist Olga Albizu. An abstract expressionist plastic artist, she also designed the covers of several other bossa nova albums by Getz.

Susan Noye Platt, art critic and historian, wrote about Albizu&#x27;s relationship with bossa nova:

==Reception==

The album won the 1965 Grammy Awards for Best Album of the Year, Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group and Best Engineered Recording - Non-Classical. &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; also won the award for Record of the Year in 1965. This was the first time a jazz album received Album of the Year.

&quot;JazzTimes&quot; declared it, &quot;essential for all serious jazz collections...served as proof that it is possible for music to be both artistically and commercially successful...this relatively sparse setting with the great Getz perfectly fit the music, resulting in a true gem.&quot; &quot;Vibe&quot; listed it as one of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 447 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was listed by &quot;Rolling Stone Brazil&quot; as one of the 100 best Brazilian albums in history. The album was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001.

The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Charles Frederick Hughes (14 October 1866 – 28 May 1934) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as Chief of Naval Operations from 1927 to 1930.

==Early life==
Born in Bath, Maine, Hughes was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1884. Upon graduation on 8 June 1888, he went to the Fleet for the customary two years at sea preceding a commission as an ensign. He received that commission on 1 July 1890, and was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on 27 April 1898.

==Naval career==

During the Spanish–American War, Hughes fought in Commodore George Dewey&#x27;s Asiatic Squadron. He was promoted to lieutenant on 3 March 1899. While serving ashore at the Bureau of Equipment from 1904 to 1906, he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 July 1905. During a tour of duty as recorder for the Board of Inspection and Survey between 1909 and 1911, he was promoted to commander.

Hughes assumed command of (Scout Cruiser No. 2) in 1911 and plied the troubled waters along the Mexican gulf coast in that ship and, later, in command of (Cruiser No. 15). In 1913, Hughes became chief of staff to the Commander, Atlantic Fleet, and served in that capacity during the occupation of Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico, in the spring of 1914. Promoted to captain on 10 July 1914, he returned to shore duty later that year to serve with the General Board. Hughes took command of (Battleship No. 34) in October 1916. His ship served in the American battleship squadron that operated with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands through World War I.

Hughes left &quot;New York&quot; just before the Armistice. On 10 October 1918, he was promoted to rear admiral. His first assignment as a flag officer was as commandant at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from late 1918 to 1920. Between 1920 and 1921, Hughes was Commander, 2d Battleship Squadron, Atlantic Fleet. From the latter part of 1921 to 25 June 1923 he commanded Divisions 7 and 4 of the Battle Fleet. Coming ashore again in 1923, he became President of the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, on 1 July. A year later, Hughes moved to the job of Director of Fleet Training.

That assignment lasted until 10 October 1925. Soon thereafter, Hughes was appointed Commander in Chief, Battle Fleet. On 14 November 1927 Admiral Hughes became the fourth person to occupy the office of Chief of Naval Operations. He completed his tour of duty in that post on 11 September 1930 and, on 14 October 1930, retired to his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He died in 1934 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

 and were named in his honor.

<text>Benjamin Bernard Selvin (March 5, 1898 – July 15, 1980) was an American musician, bandleader, and record producer. He was known as the Dean of Recorded Music.

According to &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records,&quot; Selvin recorded more musical sides (on 78-rpm discs) than any other person. One reason for this prolific output is that he recorded for dozens of different record labels during this productive time in the industry, using a different name for each label. His output has been estimated at 13,000 to 20,000 song titles.

== Biography and career ==
Selvin was born in New York City, United States, the son of Jewish Russian immigrants. He started his professional life at age 15 as a fiddle player in New York City night clubs. Six years later, as leader of his own dance band, the Novelty Orchestra, he released what was later alleged to be the biggest-selling popular song in the first quarter-century of recorded music. &quot;Dardanella&quot; allegedly sold more than six million copies and an additional million pieces of sheet music—although in a joint interview with Gustave Haenschen, founding director of popular-music releases at Brunswick Records, Selvin described the alleged record-sales total as “nonsensical” and said the actual sales of “Dardanella” and other purported “million-sellers” in the 1920s was 150,000 discs. He was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) that was presented to Selvin on his retirement on March 14, 1963.

=== Early career (1919–1927) ===
Selvin started recording for Victor in 1919. He proceeded to record for almost all record companies at the time including Paramount, OKeh, Emerson, Lyric, Arto, Cardinal, Vocalion, Pathe, Federal, Brunswick, Grey Gull, Banner (and the related dime store labels), and Columbia. From 1922 to 1925, over half of his records were on Vocalion, but he apparently did not have an exclusive contract with any of these labels until he signed with Columbia in 1927.

=== Columbia ===
From 1927 to 1934 Selvin was artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) director for Columbia Records, where his many productions included musicians Mannie Klein, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, and Bunny Berigan. Many of these recordings are collectable and prized (especially those recorded in 1931–1934).

There were incorrect reports that Ben Selvin&#x27;s Band played under the name &quot;Perley Stevens and his Orchestra&quot;. Perley Stevens occasionally played with Ben Selvin&#x27;s Band and many others, including Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey Orchestras and Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Band. During the Columbia era, Selvin recorded under many different names (for Columbia, OKeh, Odeon, Parlophone, Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, and Clarion) including:

* The Broadway Nitelites
* The Knickerbockers
* The Columbians
* The Cavaliers
* The Radiolites
* Barney Trimble and his Oklahomans
* Jerry Mason and his Californians
* The Harmonians
* Rudy Marlow and his Orchestra

* Cloverdale Country Club Orchestra
* Ed Parker and his Orchestra
* Jerry Fenwyck and his Orchestra
=== After Columbia ===
Under his own name, Selvin had accepted an exclusive contract to Brunswick Records when the company&#x27;s management decided to venture into radio with “The Brunswick Hour”, under the direction of Gus Haenschen. When it became clear to Brunswick&#x27;s management that an urgent need existed for pre-recorded music programming for smaller radio stations unable to afford their own orchestras, Brunswick&#x27;s general manager William A. Brophy agreed with the recommendations of his assistant secretary Percy L. Deutsch, popular-music director Haenschen, and arranger-conductor Frank Black to develop a library of high-quality recorded music for leasing to smaller radio stations. The new venture was called the World Broadcasting System, with newly-constructed recording facilities in Manhattan called Sound Studios, Inc. Haenschen persuaded Selvin to leave Brunswick to accept an offer from Columbia Records to become the company&#x27;s Artists and Repertoire director while also serving as a silent partner in the World Broadcasting venture.

Selvin, who was known for his ability to write orchestral arrangements rapidly and to oversee multiple recording sessions, became a central figure in the success of World Broadcasting. His experience there led him to play a founding role in Muzak in the 1930s. In 1934 he was named Vice President of programming at Muzak in New York City. He was musical director of Majestic Records beginning in 1947. At Columbia Records as A&amp;R director and then vice-president, Selvin was in charge of the recordings of Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
In 1953, Selvin left his post as general manager in the Southern Music Publishing Co. and emerged as an A&amp;R director at RCA Victor in charge of the company&#x27;s popular Camden Records label as well as its RCA Thesaurus electrical transcriptions library. 
Subsequently, he served as the musical director for a recording in 1954 with John Serry Sr. for RCA Thesaurus. In 1954 Selvin also recruited another artist from the realm of easy listening music for the RCA Thesaurus library - George Melachrino. In 1956 he served once again as musical director with Serry for another swing jazz album at Dot Records (&quot;See Squeeze Play&quot;). As the decade came to a close, Selvin continued to expand the content of the RCA Thesaurus musical library by recruiting several orchestra leaders from the Big Band era including: Sammy Kaye, Freddie Martin and Lawrence Welk. An agreement with the JATP impresario Norman Granz was also signed at this time which enabled Selvin to showcase performances by leading soloists from the realm of Jazz including: Count Basie, Roy Eldridge, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Gene Krupa, Oscar Peterson and Art Tatum.

After retirement, he became a consultant to 3M, helping them make the transition from vinyl records to audio cassettes. He also served as a musical consultant to Top of the Fair venue at the New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1964.

== Death ==
Selvin died at his home at 112 Reni Road in Flower Hill, New York, on July 15, 1980. He was 82-years-old at the time of his death, which had been caused by a heart attack.

==Honours==

The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; states that Ben Selvin made a record 9,000 recordings as either a bandleader, violinist or recording manager from 1919 to 1966. The cumulative output of recorded songs credited to him over the decades has been estimated to total between 13,000-20,000 different titles. In recognition of his achievements, Selvin was awarded a gold disk by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1963.

<doc id="1043218" wikidata="Q703286" url="?curid=1043218" title="Champon">
<text>, also known as Chanpon, is a noodle dish that is a regional cuisine of Nagasaki, Japan. There are different versions in Japan, Korea and China. The dish was inspired by Chinese cuisine. 

&quot;Champon&quot; is made by frying pork, seafood and vegetables with lard; a soup made with chicken and pig bones is then added. Ramen noodles made especially for &quot;champon&quot; are added and then boiled. Unlike other ramen dishes, only one pan is needed as the noodles are boiled in the soup. Depending on the season and the situation, the ingredients differ. Hence the taste and style may depend on the location and time of year.

Although Nagasaki Champon is the best-known rendition, there are other variations found in Japan. &quot;Ankake no Champon&quot; is a soy-sauce based variant found in Tottori, Shimane Prefectures, as well as the city of Amagasaki in Hyōgo Prefecture. In the city of Akita, a version with miso broth is served, with the soup filling the bowl almost to the point of overflowing.

In Okinawa, Champon is a rice dish where assorted vegetables, thinly-sliced meat (pork, luncheon meat or corned beef hash) and scrambled egg are fried and served on top of rice. The Korean Jjamppong is a similar noodle dish with a spicy seafood broth, with similar origins as part of Korean Chinese cuisine.

==History==

&quot;Champon&quot; was first served by , a Chinese restaurant founded in Nagasaki in 1899. According to the restaurant&#x27;s website, this was based on a dish in Fujian cuisine, (pronounced as &quot;tó̤ng nṳ̀ sí mīng&quot; in Min Bei), which translates to &quot;shredded meat noodles in soup&quot;. The majority of the Chinese population in Nagasaki Chinatown is from Fujian. In the middle of the Meiji era (late 19th century – early 20th century), the owner saw a need for a cheap, filling meal that suited the palates of hundreds of Chinese students who came to Japan for school. Nowadays, &quot;champon&quot; is a popular specialty food (or &quot;meibutsu&quot;) of Nagasaki.

==Etymology==
There are several theories as to the origin of the word &quot;champon&quot;. One theory is that it was derived from the Hokkien word &quot;chia̍h-pn̄g&quot; (食飯), which means &quot;to eat a meal&quot;, which might fit the sense of &quot;a hearty noodle dish made of mixed ingredients&quot;. Another theory is that the word was derived from the word campur from Indonesian, meaning &quot;mixed&quot; (see &quot;Nasi campur&quot;, a Javanese dish), which would fit the term&#x27;s older sense of &quot;mixed together&quot;. 

The original sense of &quot;mixed together&quot; appears in texts from the mid-1700s. Some Japanese dictionaries trace this to Chinese term (&quot;to mix&quot;), pronounced as &quot;chham-hô&quot; in modern Min-Nan and as &quot;chānhuò&quot; in modern Mandarin.

Usage to refer to the food item appears from the late 19th century to early 20th century, apparently originating from the &quot;Shikairō&quot; Chinese restaurant in Nagasaki.

<doc id="1043220" wikidata="Q6629785" url="?curid=1043220" title="Picacho Peak State Park">
<text>Picacho Peak State Park is a state park surrounding Picacho Peak in Picacho, Arizona. The park is located between Casa Grande and Tucson near Interstate 10 in Pinal County. Its centerpiece spire is visible from downtown Tucson, a distance of . The summit rises to above mean sea level. Though appearing to be the remnant of a volcanic neck, it is now believed to be a tilted and eroded piece of rock overlain by a lava flow.

==Name==
The place name &quot;Picacho Peak&quot; is etymologically redundant: &quot;picacho&quot; means &#x27;peak&#x27; in Spanish. In 1775 the peak was referred to as &quot;Cerro de Taca&quot; &#x27;Taca Hill&#x27; by Father Francisco Garcés, using the Oʼodham name &quot;Tcacca&quot; or &quot;Taceo&quot;. It was also called &quot;Picacho del Tucson&quot; &#x27;Tucson Peak&#x27; in the past.

==Description==
The park is celebrated for wildflowers that appear mid-February to early April following good winter rain. Though set next to an interstate highway, the park&#x27;s west face possesses an unspoiled Sonoran Desert setting. A small flat space on top of the spire can be reached via two trail heads. Portions of the trails are precarious, and hikers are aided by cables and catwalks. These additions make the routes some of the few via ferrata in the United States. From the top, there is a view south to the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson, east across Interstate 10 to Newman Peak, northwest to Tabletop Mountain near Casa Grande, north to the many mountain ranges surrounding Phoenix, and west to where the north-running Santa Cruz River runs underground supporting farms in a quaint desert valley.

Park rangers recommend that hikers wear sturdy boots and carry two liters of water per person. Gloves are commonly used to help grip the cables.

==History==
The Butterfield Overland Mail route had a stop near Picacho Peak. The park is near the site of the Battle of Picacho Pass, one of several American Civil War era engagements to occur in Arizona Territory. A Union cavalry patrol from California skirmished with Confederate scouts from Texas, and three men were killed. This marks the second westernmost battle of the American Civil War. Every year during early March, there are reenactments of the battle and other demonstrations of Civil War military history.

==Appearances in fiction==
Picacho Peak features prominently in the novel &quot;The Host&quot; by Stephenie Meyer, serving as a guide to the main character in the first act of the story. Much of the action of the novel takes place in or near the state park.

==Plane crash==
On June 8, 2024, a plane crashed near the summit of Picacho Peak, killing its pilot, 68-year-old James Galvin of Oro Valley.

<doc id="1043223" wikidata="Q5623430" url="?curid=1043223" title="Gwen Ifill">
<text>Gwendolyn L. Ifill ( ; September 29, 1955 – November 14, 2016) was an American journalist, television newscaster, and author. In 1999, she became the first African-American woman to host a nationally televised U.S. public affairs program with &quot;Washington Week in Review&quot;. She was the moderator and managing editor of &quot;Washington Week&quot; and co-anchor and co-managing editor, with Judy Woodruff, of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, both of which air on PBS. Ifill was a political analyst and moderated the 2004 and 2008 vice-presidential debates. She authored the best-selling book &quot;The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama&quot;.

Gwen Ifill was posthumously awarded the Dunnigan-Payne Prize for lifetime career achievement on Saturday, April 29, 2023, at the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner.

==Early life and education==
Gwendolyn L. Ifill was born in Jamaica, Queens in New York City. She was the fifth of six children of African Methodist Episcopal (AME) minister (Oliver) Urcille Ifill Sr., a Panamanian of Barbadian descent who emigrated from Panama, and Eleanor Ifill, who was from Barbados. Her father&#x27;s ministry required the family to live in several cities in New England and on the Eastern Seaboard during her youth, where he pastored AME churches. As a child, she lived in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts church parsonages and in federally subsidized housing in Buffalo and New York City. Ifill graduated from Springfield Central High School (then Classical High School) in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1973. She graduated in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts in communications from Simmons College, a women&#x27;s college in Boston.

==Career==
While at Simmons College, Ifill interned for the &quot;Boston Herald-American.&quot; One day at work, she discovered a note on her desk that read, &quot;Nigger go home.&quot; After showing the note to editors at the newspaper, who &quot;were horrified,&quot; they offered her a job when she graduated from college in 1977. Ifill&#x27;s close friend Michele Norris stated that Ifill said, &quot;&#x27;That was really unfortunate, but I have work to do.&#x27; And that&#x27;s how she got the job. She didn&#x27;t get the job out of sympathy. She got the job because she didn&#x27;t let that slow her down.&quot;

Ifill went on to work for the &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; from 1981 to 1984 and for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 1984 to 1991. She left the &quot;Post&quot; after being told she was not ready to cover Capitol Hill, but was hired by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where she covered the White House from 1991 to 1994. Her first job in television was with NBC, where she was the network&#x27;s Capitol Hill reporter in 1994.

In October 1999, she became the moderator of the PBS program &quot;Washington Week in Review&quot;, the first black woman to host a national political talk show on television. She was a senior correspondent for &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;. Ifill appeared on various news shows, including &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, &quot;Inside Washington&quot;, and &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot;. In November 2006, she co-hosted &quot;Jamestown Live!&quot;, an educational webcast commemorating the 400th anniversary of Jamestown, Virginia.

Ifill served on the boards of the Harvard Institute of Politics, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Museum of Television and Radio, and the University of Maryland&#x27;s Philip Merrill College of Journalism. In 2017, the committee to Protect Journalists renamed the Burton Benjamin Memorial Award, which started in 1991, to Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. The award has since been given to Judy Woodruff in 2017, Maria Ressa in 2018, Zaffar Abbas in 2019, Amal Clooney in 2020 and Jimmy Lai in 2021.

===2004 and 2008 vice-presidential debates===

On October 5, 2004, Ifill moderated the vice-presidential debate between the Republican Vice President Dick Cheney and the Democratic candidate and U.S. Senator from North Carolina, John Edwards. Howard Kurtz described the consensus that Ifill &quot;acquitted herself well&quot; as moderator. She was the first African-American woman to moderate a vice-presidential debate.

Ifill also moderated the vice-presidential debate on October 2, 2008, between the Democratic U.S. Senator from Delaware Joe Biden and the Republican governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, at Washington University in St. Louis. The debate&#x27;s format offered Ifill freedom to cover domestic and international issues.

Before the 2008 debate, Ifill&#x27;s objectivity was questioned by conservative talk radio, blogs, cable news programs and some independent media analysts because of her book &quot;The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama&quot;, which was scheduled to be released on Inauguration Day 2009, but whose contents had not been disclosed to the debate commission or the campaigns. The book was mentioned in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and appeared in trade catalogues as early as July 2008, well before Ifill was selected by the debate committee.
Several analysts viewed Ifill&#x27;s book as creating a conflict of interest, including Kelly McBride of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, who said, &quot;Obviously the book will be much more valuable to her if Obama is elected.&quot; John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, said in an interview on Fox News Channel, &quot;I think she will do a totally objective job because she is a highly respected professional.&quot; Asked about the forthcoming book, McCain responded, &quot;Does this help...if she has written a book that&#x27;s favorable to Senator Obama? Probably not. But I have confidence that Gwen Ifill will do a professional job.&quot;

To critics Ifill responded,

After the debate Ifill received praise for her performance. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that she received &quot;high marks for equal treatment of the candidates&quot;.

Ifill&#x27;s moderation of the debates won her pop-culture recognition when the debates were parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with Queen Latifah portraying Ifill. PBS ombudsman Michael Getler twice wrote about letters he received complaining of bias in Ifill&#x27;s news coverage. He dismissed complaints that Ifill appeared insufficiently enthusiastic about Sarah Palin&#x27;s speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention, and concluded that Ifill had played a &quot;solid, in my view, and central role in PBS coverage of both conventions.&quot;

=== 2009–2016 ===

On August 18 and 19, 2009, Ifill appeared as the guest expert lifeline on the 10th Anniversary Primetime Celebration of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; which was hosted by Regis Philbin. In order of appearance other experts during the run were Sam Donaldson, George Stephanopoulos, Wolf Blitzer, Cokie Roberts, Candy Crowley, Connie Chung, Jodi Picoult, Ken Jennings, Mo Rocca, and Bill Nye. She was used as a lifeline just once, by Nik Bonaddio, who was accurately told by Ifill that the quote &quot;The first thing we do, let&#x27;s kill all the lawyers&quot; was a line from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, Part II&quot;.
In September 2011, Ifill was a presenter at the 32nd News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards.

On August 6, 2013, &quot;NewsHour&quot; named Ifill and Judy Woodruff as co-anchors and co-managing editors. They shared anchor duties Monday through Thursday; Woodruff was the sole anchor on Friday. In November 2015, Ifill was the master of ceremonies at the 2015 LBJ Liberty &amp; Justice For All Award ceremony.

In February 2016, she and Woodruff, moderating the debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, became the first team of women to moderate a Democratic presidential debate.

==Published works==
Ifill&#x27;s book &quot;The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama&quot; was published on January 20, 2009, the Inauguration Day of President Obama. The book focused on several African-American politicians, including Obama and other up-and-comers such as then-member of Congress Artur Davis, then-Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, and then mayor of Newark, New Jersey Cory Booker. The publisher, Random House, described the book as showing &quot;why this is a pivotal moment in American history&quot; through interviews with black power brokers and through Ifill&#x27;s observations and analysis of issues. The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller.

== Honors and awards ==
Ifill was awarded the Women in Film and Video Women of Vision Award in 2000. In 2004, she received the Gracie Allen Tribute Award from the Foundation for American Women in Radio and Television.

In 2012, Ifill was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame. In 2014, she was awarded the Al Neuharth Award for Excellence in Journalism. Her work on the PBS town hall special &quot;America After Ferguson&quot; earned her a nomination for Outstanding Host in a Talk, Reality, News/ Information or Variety (Series or Special) at the 46th NAACP Image Awards. In November 2015, she accepted the Lifetime Achievement award from the Women&#x27;s Media Center at the annual Women&#x27;s Media Awards ceremony. She received the Fourth Estate Award from the National Press Club in 2015. Columbia University awarded Ifill the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism in 2016, but she died two days before the scheduled ceremony.

Ifill received more than 20 honorary doctorates from universities around the world, including Georgetown University, Smith College, Bates College and Skidmore College. In May 2011, she served as a commencement speaker at Morehouse College.

On the first anniversary of her death, November 14, 2017, Ifill&#x27;s alma mater Simmons College announced that they would be launching a school in 2018, named in her honor as the &quot;Gwen Ifill College of Media, Arts and Humanities&quot;.

On January 30, 2020, Ifill was honored on a U.S. postage stamp.

On June 17, 2021, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation renamed Railroad Park in Queens for her.

She was close to her large extended family, socialized with Washington luminaries as well as colleagues, and supported and mentored young journalists. Sherrilyn Ifill, a cousin and president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, stated at the funeral service that her cousin &quot;represented the most American of success stories.&quot;

In her spare time, Ifill was an avid reader. She never married and had no children.

==Death==
 Ifill died of breast and endometrial cancer on November 14, 2016, at age 61. According to CNN, she spent her final days at a Washington, D.C. hospice, surrounded by family and friends.

On November 14, &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; devoted their full show in tribute to her. Over the course of the following week, this developed into a series of tributes on various &quot;NewsHours&quot; as &quot;Remembering Gwen.&quot; Sara Just of PBS and WETA-TV called Ifill &quot;a journalist&#x27;s journalist&quot;.

President Obama extended his condolences to Ifill&#x27;s family, saying that he &quot;always appreciated [her] reporting even when [he] was at the receiving end of one of her tough interviews.&quot; Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, in expressing his condolences, described Ifill as &quot;an incredibly talented and respected journalist.&quot; First Lady Michelle Obama was among the thousands of mourners who attended Ifill&#x27;s funeral at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="1043230" wikidata="Q3495355" url="?curid=1043230" title="Little Feat (album)">
<text>Little Feat is the debut studio album by American rock band Little Feat, released in 1971 by Warner Bros. Records.

The album was recorded mostly in sessions between August and September 1970. Its sound is in a similar vein as the band&#x27;s more widely known later recordings, such as 1973&#x27;s &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot;. The record features Little Feat&#x27;s initial line-up, with Roy Estrada on bass. It was the first of eight albums by the band before its first break up in 1979. The cover shows the mural &quot;Venice in the Snow&quot;, painted by the L. A. Fine Arts Squad in 1970, in Venice, Los Angeles.

The album was a commercial flop, selling very poorly. However, critical reception was very positive. In 2007, the album was released as a gold CD through the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.

<doc id="1043236" wikidata="Q22260" url="?curid=1043236" title="Claire McCaskill">
<text>Claire Conner McCaskill (; born July 24, 1953) is an American former politician who served as a United States senator from Missouri from 2007 to 2019 and as State Auditor of Missouri from 1999 to 2007.

McCaskill is a native of Rolla, Missouri. She graduated from the University of Missouri and the University of Missouri School of Law. A member of the Democratic Party, McCaskill served as a member of the Missouri House of Representatives from 1983 to 1989, as Jackson County Prosecutor from 1993 to 1998, and as the 34th State Auditor of Missouri from 1999 to 2007. She ran for governor of Missouri in the 2004 election, defeating Democratic incumbent Bob Holden in the Democratic primary and losing to Republican Matt Blunt in a close general election.

McCaskill was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, the first woman to be elected to the chamber from Missouri (Jean Carnahan was appointed upon the death of her husband). Re-elected in 2012, McCaskill was defeated in 2018 by Republican challenger Josh Hawley. Since February 2019, McCaskill has served as a political analyst for MSNBC and NBC.

==Early life, education, and early law career==
McCaskill was born in Rolla, Missouri. Her father, William Young McCaskill (1925–1993), served as a state Insurance Commissioner during the administration of Governor Warren E. Hearnes. Her mother, Betty Anne (née Ward; 1928–2012), was the first woman elected to the city council of Columbia, Missouri. Betty Anne McCaskill lost a race for a seat in the state House of Representatives to Leroy Blunt, the father of U.S. Senator Roy Blunt and grandfather of former Missouri Governor Matt Blunt.

McCaskill spent her early childhood in the small Missouri town of Houston, later moving to Lebanon, and eventually Columbia. She attended David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, where she was a cheerleader, Pep Club president, a member of the debate club, a musical cast member, and homecoming queen. While attending the University of Missouri, McCaskill joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, graduating in 1975 with a B.A. in political science. She received her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Missouri School of Law in 1978. In the summer of 1974, before graduating from the University of Missouri, McCaskill studied at the Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems at Georgetown University.

From the time she graduated from law school in 1978 until her exit from the U.S. Senate in January 2019, McCaskill spent all but three years of her professional career in the public sector. The exception is the three years she spent in private practice as an attorney in a Kansas City law firm (1989 to 1991). Following her graduation from law school, she spent one year as a law clerk on the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District, which sits in Kansas City. Thereafter, McCaskill joined the Jackson County prosecutor&#x27;s office, where she specialized in arson cases.

==Early political career==

===State legislature===
In 1982, McCaskill was elected to represent the Brookside neighborhood of Kansas City in the Missouri House of Representatives. She left the State House and contemplated running for Jackson County Prosecutor in 1988, but did not pursue the position when her mentor, fellow Democrat and incumbent Prosecutor Albert Riederer decided to seek another term.

===County politics===
In 1990, McCaskill was elected to the Jackson County Legislature (the equivalent of a county commission or county council).

In February 1991, she testified in favor of a Missouri Senate bill that would prohibit a man accused of raping his wife from using marriage as a defense. &quot;This is simply an issue of fundamental justice. It&#x27;s embarrassing that we live in a state where it&#x27;s okay to rape your wife&quot;, McCaskill said.

In December 1991, McCaskill announced her intention to run for county prosecutor. At the time of the announcement, Riederer had not announced whether he was going to seek reelection. McCaskill said that crime had &quot;run amok&quot; during Riederer&#x27;s eleven years as county prosecutor. McCaskill won the Democratic primary, and she went on to win the 1992 general election with 53 percent of the vote. McCaskill was the first woman to serve as prosecutor for Jackson County. She was reelected in 1996 with 71 percent of the vote.

===State auditor===

In 1998, McCaskill was elected as state auditor with 50.3 percent of the vote in the general election. She was the second female to hold the post, the first having been her immediate predecessor, Margaret B. Kelly.

When McCaskill ran for reelection in 2002, the winner of the Republican Party primary was Al Hanson, who had previously been incarcerated for fraud. Hanson said he was qualified to detect fraud because he had committed fraud himself. Because of Hanson&#x27;s history, the leader of the Missouri Republican Party urged voters not to vote for Hanson in the general election. McCaskill was reelected with 60 percent of the vote.

===2004 gubernatorial campaign===

McCaskill announced her intent to challenge incumbent governor Bob Holden in the Democratic primary on October 20, 2003.

On August 3, 2004, McCaskill defeated Holden, becoming the first candidate to defeat an incumbent governor in a primary election in state history. McCaskill carried much of the rural outstate, while also carrying areas whose voters had taken issues with Holden&#x27;s actions, such as in Boone County home to the University of Missouri, which faced cuts under Holden.

On November 2, 2004, McCaskill lost to her Republican opponent, then-Secretary of State Matt Blunt in the general election by a margin of 51% to 48%. McCaskill&#x27;s loss to Blunt was the first defeat in her twenty-year political career.

====2006====

Both incumbent Jim Talent and McCaskill easily defeated their opponents in their respective primaries on August 8, 2006. McCaskill and Talent debated each other on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on October 8, 2006. On November 8, 2006, McCaskill defeated Talent by a margin of 50% to 47% with two minor-party candidates taking the remainder.

====2012====

McCaskill ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced Republican nominee Todd Akin in the general election. Until mid-August, polling showed them running neck and neck. Then, in a television interview on August 12, Akin claimed that women who were the victims of what he described as &quot;legitimate rape&quot; rarely ended up pregnant. His comments caused controversy and he was criticized by members of both parties. He faced calls to withdraw from the race but did not do so, and McCaskill opened up an increasing lead in opinion polls. Akin&#x27;s comments caused a backlash among voters, particularly women, and McCaskill was re-elected with 55% of the vote to his 39%. Libertarian candidate Jonathan Dine received 6%.

In August 2015, McCaskill penned a &quot;Politico&quot; article describing how she indirectly helped Akin—who she believed would make a weak general election candidate—win the Republican primary. Specifically, her campaign ran ads during primary season criticizing Akin as being too conservative; McCaskill did this to encourage conservatives (via reverse psychology) to vote for Akin. &quot;Washington Post&quot; contributor Jonathan Adler and others questioned whether McCaskill&#x27;s indirect coordination with the Akin campaign constituted an unreported and in-kind contribution to Akin&#x27;s campaign in violation of federal election law.

====2018====
McCaskill announced she was running for her third term. Six declared Democratic opponents and five Republicans, including Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, were declared candidates for the GOP primary. On July 27, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that Microsoft had discovered that in September 2017, GRU &quot;Fancy Bear&quot; hackers had attempted spoofing hacks of her staff aides&#x27; email in an attempt to target her candidacy efforts, on behalf of the Russian state. Less than three weeks before the November general election, conservative group Project Veritas released secretly recorded video footage of statements by McCaskill and her campaign staff that appeared to differ from their public stances on several issues. In response, McCaskill said she had been &quot;very upfront about all my positions&quot;, and called on Republican opponent and State Attorney General Hawley to launch an investigation into whether state laws were violated in the capturing and publishing of this footage. On election day, Hawley received 51% of the vote, to McCaskill&#x27;s 46%. She has said that one of the reasons she lost was her party&#x27;s lack of reach to rural Americans. McCaskill later said that the &quot;spectacle&quot; her fellow Democrats created during the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court also played a factor in her defeat.

===Tenure===

McCaskill was the first elected woman to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate. Jean Carnahan was appointed to the Senate following her husband&#x27;s death and posthumous election, but was defeated in a close election by Jim Talent.
In 2006, McCaskill defeated Talent for a full term.
In 2011, she became Missouri&#x27;s senior Senator when Roy Blunt took office as the junior Senator.

====Political positions====
Through 2012, McCaskill was named by the &quot;National Journal&quot; as one of the ten most &quot;moderate&quot; senators. In 2011, she was ranked 50th on its scale of the 100 senators, from most liberal to most conservative. In 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot; rated McCaskill&#x27;s voting record as 53% liberal and 47% conservative. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2012 that she was the second-most-likely Democratic senator to vote against her party. The conservative Americans for Prosperity gave her a 30% score for being in line with their positions in 2016. The progressive Americans for Democratic Action gave her a 65% liberal quotient in 2015. As of 2018, &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, which tracks Congressional votes, found that McCaskill voted with President Donald Trump&#x27;s position 45% of the time.

====2008 presidential election====

In January 2008, McCaskill endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, making her one of the first Senators to do so. She was one of the most visible faces for his campaign, and her support was crucial to Obama&#x27;s narrow victory in the Missouri primary in February 2008. She has credited her daughter Maddie as having persuaded her to publicly endorse Obama. She was frequently mentioned as a possible vice-presidential nominee for Obama, but was never seriously considered. She spoke on the opening day of the Democratic National Convention in August 2008.

====2016 presidential election====
In 2013, McCaskill announced that she would be supporting Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. During the primaries, McCaskill was among Clinton&#x27;s top surrogates. She described Bernie Sanders as &quot;too liberal&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot; and saying that the enthusiasm of his supporters was no more impressive than that of Ron Paul&#x27;s supporters in 2012. On March 21, after Clinton&#x27;s sweep of Southern primaries, McCaskill called for Sanders to throw his support to Clinton.

====Economic issues====

In 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave her a 46% score on &quot;Liberal on Economic Policy&quot; and a 53% score on &quot;Conservative on Economic Policy&quot;. In 2016, FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth, both of which support lower taxes, gave her ratings of 10% and 15%, respectively.

In November 2017, President Trump visited Missouri to promote his tax bill and said that if McCaskill didn&#x27;t support his tax plan, she should be voted out of office. She said that she could support a tax bill put together &quot;in a bipartisan way&quot; and that she would support &quot;doubling the standard deduction&quot;, &quot;enhancing the child tax credit&quot;, and even &quot;some corporate tax relief as long as we were cleaning up some of the loopholes that allow so many corporations to avoid paying their fair share.&quot; But she did not support Trump&#x27;s tax bill, which in Missouri, she said, would mainly help rich St. Louis suburbanites.

Ahead of an August 7, 2018, Missouri vote on Proposition A on adopting a right-to-work law in Missouri, McCaskill endorsed a &quot;no&quot; vote on the proposition.

====Immigration====
In 2010, McCaskill voted for the DREAM Act, which would have given undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children a pathway to citizenship provided that they fulfilled certain conditions.

In January 2018, McCaskill and three other Democratic senators were cosponsors of the Border and Port Security Act, legislation that would mandate that US Customs and Border Protection &quot;hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled&quot; in addition to requiring the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements that could be used for ports of entry.

McCaskill has said that &quot;protecting the DREAMers has to be a very top priority.&quot; McCaskill opposed the Trump administration&#x27;s policy of separating immigrant families who illegally crossed the border, and supported legislation to end the family separation policy.

====Government spending====
McCaskill co-sponsored the Saving Federal Dollars Through Better Use of Government Purchase and Travel Cards Act, which sought to improve the processes related to the use of credit cards by government employees.

====Armed services====

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCaskill has called for nuclear weapons modernization. In June 2017, she voted to support Trump&#x27;s $350 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia.

On January 14, 2014, she introduced the Victims Protection Act of 2014 (S. 1917; 113th Congress), which seeks to help victims of sexual assault in the military. This bill was a watered down version of a similar sexual assault bill previously introduced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. The latter proposal would have streamlined the prosecution process by removing it from the military chain of command. McCaskills&#x27; bill allows victims to give a preference as to whether they would prefer their cases to be tried in the military or in the civilian justice system. The bill passed the Senate on March 10, 2014, by a vote of 97–0.

====Disaster recovery====
As a member of the Senate ad hoc subcommittee on disaster recovery, McCaskill criticized the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x27;s handling of Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.

====Health care====
In 2017, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund gave McCaskill a 100% lifetime rating for her positions on health care. In 2016, the American Public Health Association also gave her a 100% rating for the positions she had taken on health-care issues during the previous year.

McCaskill voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, popularly known as ObamaCare, in December 2009.

In April 2017, McCaskill expressed her opposition to a single-payer healthcare system, saying it is too expensive and not realistic.

In August 2017, McCaskill introduced the Health Care Options for All Act, whereby people living in counties with no health-care exchanges &quot;would be able to buy coverage through the D.C. small business exchange, called SHOP&quot;, with the U.S. government &quot;contribut[ing] toward the cost of premiums if they meet a certain income threshold.&quot; Criticizing Trump&#x27;s health-care bill in September 2017, she called it &quot;a bait-and-switch, in which they&#x27;re trying to buy off certain states with promises of more money now, but with no guarantee that healthcare dollars in our state won&#x27;t ultimately go down.&quot; She added that the bill would not help &quot;folks in Missouri who&#x27;ve been sick before and have a pre-existing condition, and older Missourians.&quot;

At each event during her 2018 re-election bid campaign, McCaskill asked attendees with preexisting conditions to stand up, and vowed to keep in place health insurance protections for such individuals.

====Gun law====
McCaskill received an &quot;F&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) for not supporting their view of Second Amendment rights and opposing all right-to-carry legislation.

She voted for expanded background checks and co-sponsored the &quot;Feinstein Amendment,&quot; a proposal that would have made it illegal for individuals on the terror watchlist to purchase guns. In January 2016, McCaskill was one of eighteen senators to sign a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and &quot;the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it&quot; with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps &quot;to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public-health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.&quot; In June 2016, McCaskill participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster and in a sit-in on the House floor urging votes for gun control.

In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, McCaskill co-sponsored a bill to ban bump stocks.

====Terrorism====

During a 2013 congressional hearing, McCaskill asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano: &quot;Based on the evidence at this point, is there any difference between Sandy Hook and Boston other than the choice of weapon?&quot; McCaskill then urged Napolitano &quot;to reevaluate when and how the federal government defines a criminal act as terrorism&quot;.

====#MeToo====
In October 2017, in the midst of a flurry of news reports about sexual assaults by politicians and other celebrities, McCaskill said on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that while serving in the state legislature, she had asked the House Speaker, Bob F. Griffin, to discuss a bill she was sponsoring. &quot;And I explained to him the bill I had, and did he have any advice for me on how I could get it out of committee?&quot; McCaskill said. &quot;And he looked at me, and he paused, and he said, &#x27;Well, did you bring your knee pads?&#x27;&quot;

====Comments on men====
In November 2015, in a video for &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, McCaskill encouraged men to &quot;sometimes just shut the hell up.&quot; McCaskill added, &quot;It&#x27;s not that women don&#x27;t value your thoughts, it&#x27;s just that we don&#x27;t value all of them.&quot; She then set forth a variety of topics about which &quot;women no longer need to hear men&#x27;s opinions.&quot; Regarding the topic of &quot;what women do with their bodies&quot;, McCaskill advised men to &quot;hush&quot;. McCaskill described the video as a joke.

==== LGBT rights ====
On March 24, 2013, McCaskill posted to Tumblr in support of same-sex marriage: &quot;While churches should never be required to conduct marriages outside of their religious beliefs, neither should the government tell people who they have a right to marry.&quot;

On a November 4, 2020, MSNBC broadcast, McCaskill said that by supporting issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and the rights of transgender people, whom McCaskill referred to as &quot;transsexuals&quot;, Democrats &quot;left voters behind and Republicans dove in.&quot; McCaskill apologized for using the word transsexuals, which she called a &quot;hurtful term&quot;, the next day in a tweet, saying she was &quot;tired&quot; but admitting that is &quot;never a good excuse&quot;. She further said that &quot;our party should never leave behind our fight for equality for trans people or anyone else who has been marginalized by hate&quot;, adding that &quot;my record reflects that.&quot;

====Net neutrality====

In January 2018, McCaskill announced her support for a Senate bill intended to reverse the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s repeal of net neutrality; as she was the 30th Senator to support the bill, it was ensured that the bill would reach the floor of the Senate. In October 2017, McCaskill was one of four Democrats who voted to confirm FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who announced the plan to reverse net neutrality rules earlier that year. In explaining her vote, McCaskill said that she disagreed with Pai on net neutrality but voted for Pai because &quot;the president has a right to the chairman because he won the election&quot;. According to Ars Technica, &quot;it&#x27;s common for [FCC] commissioners to get broad bi-partisan support in the Senate even if their policies are opposed by one of the two major parties.&quot;

====Trade====
McCaskill opposed Trump&#x27;s trade tariffs, saying they were &quot;hurting Missouri farmers and manufacturing.&quot;

====Israel Anti-Boycott Act====
In June 2017, McCaskill co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in internationally sponsored boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

====Voting rights====
In July 2018, McCaskill introduced legislation that would make it illegal to knowingly and intentionally spread false information about an election, such as false information about the time and place of voting, voter qualifications and registration status. She said, &quot;Misinformation campaigns intended only to suppress the vote and disenfranchise Missourians are crimes that run counter to our democratic values.&quot;

==Controversies==
===Private airplane===
On March 16, 2011, McCaskill told reporters that she was &quot;embarrassed&quot; about revelations that her office had used taxpayer money for the senator&#x27;s use of a private airplane she co-owned with her husband and friends. According to a government audit, the plane was used for 90 flights taken between Washington, D.C., and her home in suburban St. Louis, as well as to numerous sites around the state of Missouri. According to McCaskill&#x27;s Senate office, all but 1 of the 90 flights in question were within Senate rules. As soon as the story broke, McCaskill sent a check for $88,000 to the U.S. Treasury as reimbursement for the flights.

The Missouri Republican Party filed a formal complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee on March 16. In response McCaskill said, &quot;The Missouri Republican Party is going to try to ride this horse as long as they can. They&#x27;re going to try to make this as big a deal as they can. Them filing the ethics complaint is about as surprising as the sun coming up.&quot; On March 21, 2011, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that McCaskill and her husband had failed to pay more than $280,000 in property taxes on the plane and were planning to sell it. &quot;I have convinced my husband to sell the damn plane&quot;, McCaskill said on a conference call with reporters. &quot;I will never set foot on the plane again&quot;. The Ethics Committee dismissed the Missouri GOP&#x27;s complaint.

The plane, a 2001 Pilatus PC-12, was sold in October 2011. It was stored at Spirit of St. Louis Airport, McCaskill confirmed, and owned by Timesaver LLC, a Delaware-based limited liability company. McCaskill noted that she had paid $38,800 in sales taxes on the plane, and she had only recently (as of March 2011) become aware that Missouri also imposed a property tax on private aircraft. She said she was &quot;disappointed&quot; in herself for not ensuring that Timesaver LLC paid the property taxes. &quot;Frankly, having the plane owned in Delaware would not negate the necessity of paying the personal property tax in Missouri&quot;, she said. &quot;This is a mistake. It should have been reported in Missouri. It was owed in Missouri. It will be paid in Missouri today&quot;.

===Meetings with Russian government officials===
On March 2, 2017, McCaskill tweeted that she had had &quot;No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever&quot;. After her own tweets of January 20, 2013 (&quot;Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador.&quot;) and August 6, 2015 (&quot;Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors&quot;) were exposed, McCaskill recanted her tweet of March 2, blaming Twitter&#x27;s character limit. McCaskill had been a leading critic of Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#x27;s meetings with Russian government officials in his capacity as United States senator and had called for Sessions&#x27;s resignation on this account. McCaskill also said that the nature of her meetings with the Russian ambassador were different to his. PolitiFact rated McCaskill&#x27;s assertion false, and also noted &quot;though the context for McCaskill&#x27;s and Sessions&#x27; interactions with Kislyak may be very different, she goes too far in saying she didn&#x27;t &#x27;ever&#x27; have that meeting or phone call.&quot;

===Pressuring Army officials to punish soldiers cleared of crimes===
In a February 4, 2014, contracting oversight hearing with Army officials, McCaskill was on record pressuring officials to bring punishment on up to 1,900 servicemembers by inappropriately adding them to Defense Department and FBI databases. As part of the botched investigation into the Guard Recruiter Assistance Program (G-RAP), false arrest records were added into federal databases after individuals were cleared of charges. This resulted in wide-ranging consequences for affected soldiers. Guardsmen who worked as police officers outside the Guard lost their jobs, concealed weapons permits were revoked, and promotions were inappropriately denied.

McCaskill was married to David Exposito, with whom she had three children. The couple divorced in 1995, after 11 years of marriage, while McCaskill was Jackson County Prosecutor. David Exposito was found murdered in Kansas City, Kansas on December 12, 2005. Exposito&#x27;s murder has never been solved.

McCaskill married Joseph Shepard in 2002.

On the October 3, 2009, episode of &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on National Public Radio, McCaskill spoke about a vacation early in her career as a lawyer, where she was a contestant on &quot;High Rollers&quot;. McCaskill reigned as champion for four days, and later sold several of her prizes to pay off her student loan debt.

McCaskill&#x27;s mother, Betty Anne McCaskill, died on October 29, 2012, from natural causes at the age of 84. A convert to Roman Catholicism, McCaskill was denied communion for her pro-choice stance on abortion by then-Bishop Raymond Burke, later Cardinal Raymond Burke.

<doc id="1043247" wikidata="Q1889901" url="?curid=1043247" title="Rhyolite, Nevada">
<text>Rhyolite is a ghost town in Nye County, in the U.S. state of Nevada. It is in the Bullfrog Hills, about northwest of Las Vegas, near the eastern boundary of Death Valley National Park. 

The town began in early 1905 as one of several mining camps that sprang up after a prospecting discovery in the surrounding hills. During an ensuing gold rush, thousands of gold-seekers, developers, miners and service providers flocked to the Bullfrog Mining District. Many settled in Rhyolite, which lay in a sheltered desert basin near the region&#x27;s biggest producer, the Montgomery Shoshone Mine.

Industrialist Charles M. Schwab bought the Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and invested heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town as well as the mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town&#x27;s peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.

Rhyolite declined almost as rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 made it more difficult to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study&#x27;s findings proved unfavorable, the company&#x27;s stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite&#x27;s population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.

After 1920, Rhyolite and its ruins became a tourist attraction and a setting for motion pictures. Most of its buildings crumbled, were salvaged for building materials, or were moved to nearby Beatty or other towns, although the railway depot and a house made chiefly of empty bottles were repaired and preserved. From 1988 to 1998, three companies operated a profitable open-pit mine at the base of Ladd Mountain, about south of Rhyolite. The Goldwell Open Air Museum lies on private property just south of the ghost town, which is on property overseen by the Bureau of Land Management.

==Names==
The town is named for rhyolite, an igneous rock composed of light-colored silicates, usually buff to pink and occasionally light gray. It belongs to the same rock class, felsic, as granite but is much less common. The Amargosa River, which flows through nearby Beatty, gets its name from the Spanish word for &quot;bitter&quot;, &quot;amargo&quot;. In its course, the river takes up large amounts of salts, which give it a bitter taste.

&quot;Bullfrog&quot; was the name Frank &quot;Shorty&quot; Harris and Ernest &quot;Ed&quot; Cross, the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush, gave to their mine. As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in &quot;A History of Beatty, Nevada&quot;, Harris said during a 1930 interview for &quot;Westways&quot; magazine, &quot;The rock was green, almost like turquoise, spotted with big chunks of yellow metal, and looked a lot like the back of a frog.&quot; The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine.
&quot;Bullfrog&quot; became so popular that Giant Bullfrog, Bullfrog Merger, Bullfrog Apex, Bullfrog Annex, Bullfrog Gold Dollar, Bullfrog Mogul, and most of the district&#x27;s other 200 or so mining companies included &quot;Bullfrog&quot; in their names. The name persisted and, decades later, was given to the short-lived Bullfrog County.

Beatty is named after &quot;Old Man&quot; Montillus (Montillion) Murray Beatty, a Civil War veteran and miner who bought a ranch along the Amargosa River just north of what became the town of Beatty. In 1906, he sold the ranch to the Bullfrog Water, Power, and Light Company. &quot;Shoshone&quot; in &quot;Montgomery Shoshone Mine&quot; refers to the Western Shoshone people indigenous to the region. In about 1875, the Shoshone had six camps along the Amargosa River near Beatty. The total population of these camps was 29, and because game was scarce, they subsisted largely on seeds, bulbs and plants gathered throughout the region, including the Bullfrog Hills.

==Geology==
The Bullfrog Hills are at the western edge of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field. Extensionally faulted volcanic rocks, ranging in age from about 13.3 million years to about 7.6 million years, overlie the region&#x27;s Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The prevailing rocks, which contain the ore deposits, are a series of rhyolitic lava flows that built to a combined thickness of about above the more ancient rock. 

After the flows ceased, tectonic stresses fractured the area into many separate fault blocks. Most of these blocks tilt to the east, and the horizontal banding of individual flows shows clearly on their western scarps. Within the blocks, the ore deposits tend to occur in nearly vertical mineralized faults or fault zones in the rhyolite. Most of the lodes in the Bullfrog Hills are not simple veins but rather fissure zones with many stringers of vein material.

==Geography and climate==
 Rhyolite is at the northern end of the Amargosa Desert in Nye County in the U.S. state of Nevada. Nestled in the Bullfrog Hills, about northwest of Las Vegas, it is about south of Goldfield, and south of Tonopah. Roughly to the east lie Beatty and the Amargosa River. To the west, roughly from Rhyolite, the Funeral and Grapevine Mountains of the Amargosa Range rise between the Amargosa Desert in Nevada and Death Valley in California. State Route 374, passing about south of Rhyolite, links Beatty to Death Valley via Daylight Pass. Rhyolite is about west of Yucca Mountain and the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which is adjacent to the Nevada Test Site.

Bordered on three sides by ridges but open to the south, the ghost town is at above sea level. The high points of the ridges are Ladd Mountain to the east, Sutherland Mountain to the west, and Busch Peak to the north. Sawtooth Mountain, the highest point in the Bullfrog Hills, rises to above sea level about northwest of Rhyolite. The hills form a barrier between the Amargosa Desert and Sarcobatus Flat to the north. Most of the primary mining communities in the Beatty–Rhyolite area during the gold-rush boom of 1904–08 were either in or on the edge of the Bullfrog Hills. Of these and many smaller towns and camps in the Bullfrog district, only Beatty survived as a populated place. Prior to its demise, the rival town of Bullfrog lay about southwest of Rhyolite, and the Montgomery Shoshone Mine was on the north side of Montgomery Mountain, about northeast of Rhyolite.

Nevada&#x27;s main climatic features are bright sunshine, low annual precipitation, heavy snowfall in the higher mountains, clean, dry air, and large daily temperature ranges. Strong surface heating occurs by day and rapid cooling by night, and usually even the hottest days have cool nights. The average percentage of possible sunshine in southern Nevada is more than 80 percent. Sunshine and low humidity in this region account for an average evaporation, as measured in evaporation pans, of more than of water a year.

Beatty, about lower in elevation than Rhyolite, receives only about of precipitation a year. July is the hottest month in Beatty, when the average high temperature is and the average low is . December and January are the coolest months with an average high of and an average low of in December and in January. Rhyolite is high enough in the hills to have relatively cool summers, and it has relatively mild winters. However, it is far from sources of water.

==History==
===Boom===
On August 9, 1904, Cross and Harris found gold on the south side of a southwestern Nevada hill later called Bullfrog Mountain. Assays of ore samples from the site suggested values up to $3,000 a ton, or about $ a ton in dollars when adjusted for inflation. Word of the discovery spread to Tonopah and beyond, and soon thousands of hopeful prospectors and speculators rushed to what became known as the Bullfrog Mining District.

Within the district, gold rush settlements quickly arose near the mines, and Rhyolite became the largest. It sprang up near the most promising discovery, the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, which in February 1905 produced ores assayed as high as $16,000 a ton, equivalent to $ a ton in . Starting as a two-man camp in January 1905, Rhyolite became a town of 1,200 people in two weeks and reached a population of 2,500 by June 1905. By then it had 50 saloons, 35 gambling tables, for prostitution, 19 lodging houses, 16 restaurants, half a dozen barbers, a public bath house, and a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Rhyolite Herald&quot;. Four daily stage coaches connected Goldfield, to the north, and Rhyolite. Rival auto lines ferried people between Rhyolite and Goldfield and the rail station in Las Vegas in Pope-Toledos, White Steamers, and other touring cars.

 Ernest Alexander &quot;Bob&quot; Montgomery, the original owner, and his partners sold the mine to industrialist Charles M. Schwab in February 1906. Schwab expanded the operation on a grand scale, hiring workers, opening new tunnels and drifts, and building a huge mill to process the ore. He had water piped in, paid to have an electric line run from a hydroelectric plant at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountain range to Rhyolite, and contracted with the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad to run a spur line to the mine. Three railroads eventually served Rhyolite. The first was the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad (LVTR), which began running regular trains to the city on December 14, 1906. Its depot, built in California-mission style, cost about $130,000, equivalent to about $ in . About a half-year later, the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad (BGR) began regular service from the north. By December 1907, the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad (TTR) began service to Rhyolite on tracks leased from the BGR. The TTR was built to reach the borax-bearing colemanite beds in Death Valley as well as the gold fields.

By 1907, about 4,000 people lived in Rhyolite, according to Richard E. Lingenfelter in &quot;Death Valley &amp; the Amargosa: A Land of Illusion&quot;. Russell R. Elliott cites an estimated population of 5,000 in 1907–08 in &quot;Nevada&#x27;s Twentieth-Century Mining Boom&quot;, noting that &quot;accurate population figures during the boom are impossible to obtain&quot;. Alan H. Patera in &quot;Rhyolite: The Boom Years&quot; states published estimates of the peak population have been &quot;as high as 6,000 or 8,000, but the town itself never claimed more than 3,500 through its newspapers&quot;. The newspapers estimated that 6,000 people lived in the Bullfrog mining district, which included the towns of Rhyolite, Bullfrog, Gold Center, and Beatty as well as camps at the major mines.

Rhyolite in 1907 had concrete sidewalks, electric lights, water mains, telephone and telegraph lines, daily and weekly newspapers, a monthly magazine, police and fire departments, a hospital, school, train station and railway depot, at least three banks, a stock exchange, an opera house, a public swimming pool and two formal church buildings. Most prominent was the three-story John S. Cook and Co. Bank on Golden Street. Finished in 1908, it cost more than $90,000, equivalent to $ in . Much of the cost went for Italian marble stairs, imported stained-glass windows, and other luxuries. The building housed brokerage offices, and a post office, as well as the bank. Other large buildings included the train depot, the three-story Overbury Bank building, and the two-story eight-room school. A miner named Tom T. Kelly built the Bottle House in February 1906 from 50,000 discarded beer and liquor bottles. Another building housed the Rhyolite Mining Stock Exchange, which opened on March 25, 1907, with 125 members, including brokers from New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other large cities. The small, modestly equipped storefront listed shares of 74 Bullfrog companies and a similar number of companies in nearby mining districts. Sixty thousand shares changed hands on the first day, and by the end of the second week the number had topped 750,000.
===Bust===
Although the mine produced more than $1 million (equivalent to about $24 million in 2009) in bullion in its first three years, its shares declined from $23 a share (in historical dollars) to less than $3. In February 1908, a committee of minority stockholders, suspecting that the mine was overvalued, hired a British mining engineer to conduct an inspection. The engineer&#x27;s report was unfavorable, and news of this caused a sudden further decline in share value from $3 to 75 cents. Schwab expressed disappointment when he learned that &quot;the wonderful high-grade [ore] that had brought [the mine] fame was confined to only a few stringers and that what he had actually bought was a large low-grade mine.&quot; 

Although the mine was still profitable, by 1909 no new ore was being discovered, and the value of the remaining ore steadily decreased. In 1910, the mine operated at a loss for most of the year, and on March 14, 1911, it was closed. By then, the stock, which had fallen to 10 cents a share, slid to 4 cents and was dropped from the exchanges.

Rhyolite began to decline before the final closing of the mine. At roughly the same time that the Bullfrog mines were running out of high-grade ore, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service, and the financial panic of 1907 restricted funding for mine development. As mines in the district reduced production or closed, unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere, businesses failed, and by 1910, the census reported only 675 residents. 

All three banks in the town closed by March 1910. The newspapers, including the &quot;Rhyolite Herald&quot;, the last to go, all shut down by June 1912. The post office closed in November 1913; the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914, and the Nevada-California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916. Within a year the town was &quot;all but abandoned&quot;, and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14. A 1922 motor tour by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found only one remaining resident, a 92-year-old man who died in 1924.

Much of Rhyolite&#x27;s remaining infrastructure became a source of building materials for other towns and mining camps. Whole buildings were moved to Beatty. The Miners&#x27; Union Hall in Rhyolite became the Old Town Hall in Beatty, and two-room cabins were moved and reassembled as multi-room homes. Parts of many buildings were used to build a Beatty school.

===Ghost town===
The Rhyolite historic townsite, maintained by the Bureau of Land Management, is &quot;one of the most photographed ghost towns in the West&quot;. Ruins include the railroad depot and other buildings, and the Bottle House, which the Famous Players Lasky Corporation, the parent of Paramount Pictures, restored in 1925 for the filming of a silent movie, &quot;The Air Mail&quot;. The ruins of the Cook Bank building were used in the 1964 film &quot;The Reward&quot; and again in 2004 for the filming of &quot;The Island&quot;. Orion Pictures used Rhyolite for its 1988 science-fiction movie &quot;Cherry 2000&quot; depicting the collapse of American society. &quot;Six-String Samurai&quot; (1998) was another movie using Rhyolite as a setting. The Rhyolite-Bullfrog cemetery, with many wooden headboards, is slightly south of Rhyolite.

 Tourism flourished in and near Death Valley in the 1920s, and souvenir sellers set up tables in Rhyolite to sell rocks and bottles on weekends. In the 1930s, Revert Mercantile of Beatty acquired a Union Oil distributorship, built a gas station in Beatty, and supplied pumps in other locations, including Rhyolite. The Rhyolite service station consisted of an old caboose, a storage tank, and a pump, managed by a local owner. In 1937, the train depot became a casino and bar called the Rhyolite Ghost Casino, which was later turned into a small museum and curio shop that remained open into the 1970s. In 1984, Belgian artist Albert Szukalski created his sculpture &quot;The Last Supper&quot; on Golden Street near the Rhyolite railway depot. The art became part of the Goldwell Open Air Museum, an outdoor sculpture park near the southern entrance to the ghost town.

===Barrick Bullfrog Mine===
Mining in and around Rhyolite after 1920 consisted mainly of working old tailings until a new mine opened in 1988 on the south side of Ladd Mountain. A company known as Bond Gold built an open-pit mine and mill at the site, about south of Rhyolite along State Route 374. LAC Minerals acquired the mine from Bond in 1989 and established an underground mine there in 1991 after a new body of ore called the North Extension was discovered. Barrick Gold acquired LAC Minerals in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine until the end of 1998. The mine used a chemical extraction process known as vat leaching involving the use of a weak cyanide solution. The process, like heap leaching, makes it possible to process ore profitably that otherwise would not qualify as mill-grade. Over its entire life, the mine processed about of ore and produced about of gold.

<text>The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) is a laboratory in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR). The current director is Venkatachalam Ramaswamy. It is one of seven Research Laboratories within NOAA&#x27;s OAR.

GFDL is engaged in comprehensive long-lead-time research to expand our scientific understanding of the physical and chemical processes that govern the behavior of the atmosphere and the oceans as complex fluid systems. These systems can be modeled mathematically and their phenomenology can be studied by computer simulation methods.

GFDL&#x27;s accomplishments include the development of the first climate models to study global warming, the first comprehensive ocean prediction codes, and the first dynamical models with significant skill in hurricane track and intensity predictions. Much current research within the laboratory is focused around the development of Earth System Models for assessment of natural and human-induced climate change.

==Accomplishments==
*The first global numerical simulations of the atmosphere — defining the basic structure of the numerical weather prediction and climate models that are still in use today throughout the world.
*The first numerical simulation of the world ocean.
*The initial definition and further elaborations of many of the central issues in global warming research, including water vapor feedback, polar amplification of temperature change, summer mid-continental dryness and cloud feedback.
*The first coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models and the first simulations of global warming using these models (including the above feedback processes and the potential weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation).
*The development of a state-of-art hurricane model and its transfer to operations in the NOAA National Weather Service and the Navy.

== Scientific divisions ==
The GFDL has a diverse community of about 300 researchers, collaborators and staff, with many from Britain, India, China, Japan, France, and other countries around the world. The laboratory is currently organized into several scientific divisions (listed alphabetically below). There is also a large group of scientific programmers known as the Modeling Systems Division, as well as a large computer support group.

===Atmospheric Physics===
Current head: Venkatachalam Ramaswamy

This divisions goal is to employ numerical models and observations of the Earth System to characterize and quantify atmospheric physical processes, particularly those involving greenhouse gases, aerosols, water vapor, and clouds, and their roles in atmospheric general circulation, weather and climate.

===Biogeochemistry, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Ecosystems===
Current head: John P. Dunne

This divisions goal is to develop and use the GFDL’s earth system models to create a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between physical, chemical, and ecological drivers and feedbacks on the earth system.

===Ocean and Cryosphere===
Current head: Rong Zhang

This divisions goal is to conduct leading research to understand ocean and cryosphere changes and variability; their interactions with weather, climate, sea level, and ecosystems; and advance prediction and projection of future changes. To support this goal, we are developing state-of-the-science numerical models for the ocean, sea ice, land ice, and fully coupled models.

===Seasonal-to-Decadal Variability and Predictability===
Current head: Thomas L. Delworth

This divisions goal is to improve our understanding of climate variability, predictability and change on time scales ranging from seasonal to multidecadal. This includes internal variability of the coupled climate system, and the response to changing radiative forcing. We are actively working to develop a next-generation experimental seasonal-to-decadal prediction system.

===Weather and Climate Dynamics===
Current head: Thomas Knutson

This divisions goal is to develop innovative physical and dynamical components for the next generation of earth system models, with special emphasis on high resolution (1–25 km) atmospheric model development. We aim to explore the frontiers of weather and climate modeling and analysis, and to improve the predictions of high-impact events such as hurricanes, floods, severe storms, and droughts, from weather to seasonal and interannual (2 year) time-scales.

== Facilities ==
The GFDL is located at Princeton University&#x27;s Forrestal Campus in Princeton, NJ.

Since March 2011, the GFDL no longer possesses an on-site supercomputer. They instead utilize a massively parallel Cray supercomputer with over 140,000 processor cores which is currently located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This contrasts from their previous systems architecture, which consisted of eight Silicon Graphics Altix computers, each housing 1024 processor cores.
Hardware updates occur on average, every 18 months.

The GFDL has been using high-performance computing systems to perform numerical modeling since the 1950s.

<doc id="1043263" wikidata="Q901117" url="?curid=1043263" title="Excitotoxicity">
<text>In excitotoxicity, nerve cells suffer damage or death when the levels of otherwise necessary and safe neurotransmitters such as glutamate become pathologically high, resulting in excessive stimulation of receptors. For example, when glutamate receptors such as the NMDA receptor or AMPA receptor encounter excessive levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, significant neuronal damage might ensue. Excess glutamate allows high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA. In evolved, complex adaptive systems such as biological life it must be understood that mechanisms are rarely, if ever, simplistically direct. For example, NMDA, in subtoxic amounts, can block glutamate toxicity and thereby induce neuronal survival.

Excitotoxicity may be involved in cancers, spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing loss (through noise overexposure or ototoxicity), and in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson&#x27;s disease, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal or hyperammonemia and especially over-rapid benzodiazepine withdrawal, and also Huntington&#x27;s disease. Other common conditions that cause excessive glutamate concentrations around neurons are hypoglycemia. Blood sugars are the primary glutamate removal method from inter-synaptic spaces at the NMDA and AMPA receptor site. Persons in excitotoxic shock must never fall into hypoglycemia. Patients should be given 5% glucose (dextrose) IV drip during excitotoxic shock to avoid a dangerous build up of glutamate around NMDA and AMPA neurons. When 5% glucose (dextrose) IV drip is not available high levels of fructose are given orally. Treatment is administered during the acute stages of excitotoxic shock along with glutamate antagonists. Dehydration should be avoided as this also contributes to the concentrations of glutamate in the inter-synaptic cleft and &quot;status epilepticus can also be triggered by a build up of glutamate around inter-synaptic neurons.&quot;

==History==
The harmful effects of glutamate on the central nervous system were first observed in 1954 by T. Hayashi, a Japanese scientist who stated that direct application of glutamate caused seizure activity, though this report went unnoticed for several years. D. R. Lucas and J. P. Newhouse, after noting that &quot;single doses of [20–30 grams of sodium glutamate in humans] have ... been administered intravenously without permanent ill-effects&quot;, observed in 1957 that a subcutaneous dose described as &quot;a little less than lethal&quot;, destroyed the neurons in the inner layers of the retina in newborn mice. In 1969, John Olney discovered that the phenomenon was not restricted to the retina, but occurred throughout the brain, and coined the term excitotoxicity. He also assessed that cell death was restricted to postsynaptic neurons, that glutamate agonists were as neurotoxic as their efficiency to activate glutamate receptors, and that glutamate antagonists could stop the neurotoxicity.

In 2002, Hilmar Bading and co-workers found that excitotoxicity is caused by the activation of NMDA receptors located outside synaptic contacts. The molecular basis for toxic extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling was uncovered in 2020 when Hilmar Bading and co-workers described a death signaling complex that consists of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor and TRPM4. Disruption of this complex using NMDAR/TRPM4 interface inhibitors (also known as ‚interface inhibitors‘) renders extrasynaptic NMDA receptor non-toxic.

==Pathophysiology==
Excitotoxicity can occur from substances produced within the body (endogenous excitotoxins). Glutamate is a prime example of an excitotoxin in the brain, and it is also the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals. During normal conditions, glutamate concentration can be increased up to 1mM in the synaptic cleft, which is rapidly decreased in the lapse of milliseconds. When the glutamate concentration around the synaptic cleft cannot be decreased or reaches higher levels, the neuron kills itself by a process called apoptosis.

This pathologic phenomenon can also occur after brain injury and spinal cord injury. Within minutes after spinal cord injury, damaged neural cells within the lesion site spill glutamate into the extracellular space where glutamate can stimulate presynaptic glutamate receptors to enhance the release of additional glutamate. Brain trauma or stroke can cause ischemia, in which blood flow is reduced to inadequate levels. Ischemia is followed by accumulation of glutamate and aspartate in the extracellular fluid, causing cell death, which is aggravated by lack of oxygen and glucose. The biochemical cascade resulting from ischemia and involving excitotoxicity is called the ischemic cascade. Because of the events resulting from ischemia and glutamate receptor activation, a deep chemical coma may be induced in patients with brain injury to reduce the metabolic rate of the brain (its need for oxygen and glucose) and save energy to be used to remove glutamate actively. (The main aim in induced comas is to reduce the intracranial pressure, not brain metabolism).

Increased extracellular glutamate levels leads to the activation of Ca2+ permeable NMDA receptors on myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, leaving oligodendrocytes susceptible to Ca2+ influxes and subsequent excitotoxicity. One of the damaging results of excess calcium in the cytosol is initiating apoptosis through cleaved caspase processing. Another damaging result of excess calcium in the cytosol is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a pore in the membranes of mitochondria that opens when the organelles absorb too much calcium. Opening of the pore may cause mitochondria to swell and release reactive oxygen species and other proteins that can lead to apoptosis. The pore can also cause mitochondria to release more calcium. In addition, production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) may be stopped, and ATP synthase may in fact begin hydrolysing ATP instead of producing it, which is suggested to be involved in depression.

Inadequate ATP production resulting from brain trauma can eliminate electrochemical gradients of certain ions. Glutamate transporters require the maintenance of these ion gradients to remove glutamate from the extracellular space. The loss of ion gradients results in not only the halting of glutamate uptake, but also in the reversal of the transporters. The Na+-glutamate transporters on neurons and astrocytes can reverse their glutamate transport and start secreting glutamate at a concentration capable of inducing excitotoxicity. This results in a buildup of glutamate and further damaging activation of glutamate receptors.

On the molecular level, calcium influx is not the only factor responsible for apoptosis induced by excitoxicity. Recently, it has been noted that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, triggered by both glutamate exposure or hypoxic/ischemic conditions, activate a CREB (cAMP response element binding) protein shut-off, which in turn caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. On the other hand, activation of synaptic NMDA receptors activated only the CREB pathway, which activates BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), not activating apoptosis.

===Exogenous excitotoxins===
Exogenous excitotoxins refer to neurotoxins that also act at postsynaptic cells but are not normally found in the body. These toxins may enter the body of an organism from the environment through wounds, food intake, aerial dispersion etc. Common excitotoxins include glutamate analogs that mimic the action of glutamate at glutamate receptors, including AMPA and NMDA receptors.

===BMAA===
The L-alanine derivative β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has long been identified as a neurotoxin which was first associated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism–dementia complex (Lytico-bodig disease) in the Chamorro people of Guam. The widespread occurrence of BMAA can be attributed to cyanobacteria which produce BMAA as a result of complex reactions under nitrogen stress. Following research, excitotoxicity appears to be the likely mode of action for BMAA which acts as a glutamate agonist, activating AMPA and NMDA receptors and causing damage to cells even at relatively low concentrations of 10 μM. The subsequent uncontrolled influx of Ca2+ then leads to the pathophysiology described above. Further evidence of the role of BMAA as an excitotoxin is rooted in the ability of NMDA antagonists like MK801 to block the action of BMAA. More recently, evidence has been found that BMAA is misincorporated in place of L-serine in human proteins. A considerable portion of the research relating to the toxicity of BMAA has been conducted on rodents. A study published in 2016 with vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in St. Kitts, which are homozygous for the apoE4 (APOE-ε4) allele (a condition which in humans is a risk factor for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease), found that vervets orally administered BMAA developed hallmark histopathology features of Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation. Vervets in the trial fed smaller doses of BMAA were found to have correlative decreases in these pathology features. This study demonstrates that BMAA, an environmental toxin, can trigger neurodegenerative disease as a result of a gene/environment interaction. While BMAA has been detected in brain tissue of deceased ALS/PDC patients, further insight is required to trace neurodegenerative pathology in humans to BMAA.

<doc id="1043265" wikidata="Q3944952" url="?curid=1043265" title="Sailin' Shoes">
<text>Sailin&#x27; Shoes is the second studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1972. Produced by Ted Templeman, it marked a shift away from the sound of the band&#x27;s eponymous debut, to that of their subsequent album, &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;. It also introduced the cover artwork of Neon Park to the group, and was the last album appearance of original bassist Roy Estrada.

==Music and recording==
The music of &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot; is a mixture of pop, rock, blues and country. Highlighted by a reworked group version of &quot;Willin&#x27;&quot;, the album also featured such enduring tracks as &quot;A Apolitical Blues,&quot; &quot;Easy to Slip&quot; and the title track, all by guitarist and lead vocalist Lowell George, the second co-written with Martin Kibbee, credited as &quot;Fred Martin&quot;, a former band-mate from The Factory, and the first appearance of the &quot;George/Martin&quot; credit on a Little Feat record. The track &quot;Texas Rose Cafe&quot; is a tribute to a post-Houston concert visit by Lowell George and others to the hippie restaurant/club/beer garden. During refreshments upstairs George had said that he liked the place so much that he was going to write a song about it and it would be on their next album. It turned out to be true and not just so much &quot;beer talk&quot;.

It was the last full Little Feat record to be produced by an outsider, until 1977&#x27;s &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot;, with each of the three interim albums being produced almost entirely by Lowell George. Noted Los Angeles-based session percussionist Milt Holland played percussion on &quot;Easy to Slip&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; and he also played tabla on the follow-up album &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;. Ron Elliott of the Beau Brummels played rhythm guitar on &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot; and Debbie Lindsey provided the female vocals on &quot;Cold, Cold, Cold&quot; and the title track.

==Artwork==
With his design for a &quot;sailing shoe&quot; of a cake swinging on a tree swing, the album&#x27;s front cover by Neon Park seems to be an allusion to &quot;The Swing&quot; by painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Park himself said of the cover: &quot;The &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot; cover was inspired by Louis XIV. I&#x27;d just seen Rossellini&#x27;s film about Louis XIV. And it seemed to relate a lot to Hollywood. A situation ruled by someone who kept everybody under his thumb by keeping them in hock from buying fancy clothes seemed to relate to Hollywood somehow. Actually, the only thing that was missing was the Hollywood sign, which I was going to put in the background. I thought that would be gauche. But I had a chance to pick up on that later with &quot;The Last Record Album&quot;.” The cover design also includes a giant snail and Mick Jagger dressed as Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Boy&quot; as Park had been inspired by the film &quot;Performance&quot;.

==Reception==
It was voted number 469 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2008 the album was released as Gold CD by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.

&quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Easy to Slip&quot; &quot;features passionate vocal harmonies and one of the finest rhythm sections that ever rocked.&quot;

<text>Feats Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1974, on the Warner Bros. label. The cover was designed by Neon Park.

According to Richie Hayward, &quot;Wait Till the Shit Hits the Fan&quot; dates back to their debut but the band had had trouble recording it on the previous two albums, due to its irregular meter. It was scrapped until the sessions for this album when it was recorded live in the studio as &quot;The Fan&quot;; the original version appeared on the 2000 boxed set &quot;Hotcakes &amp; Outtakes: 30 Years Of Little Feat&quot;.

In 2000 the album was voted number 718 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Voluntary collective licensing is an alternative approach to solve the problem of software piracy using file sharing technologies. The idea is to make file sharing networks subscribe-only for a small fee and then distribute the collected money among the artists based on the popularity of their work. It has been endorsed since 2003 by the EFF.

Arguably Spotify is an implementation of this idea, although it is not marketed as a file-sharing network and also allows ad-supported free use in addition to paid use.

<text>Riverside Park Speedway was a 1/4-mile oval paved race track, located at the present site of Six Flags New England in Agawam, Massachusetts, one mile north of the Massachusetts–Connecticut state line.

To capitalize on the nation&#x27;s new attraction to auto racing following World War II, park owner Edward J. Carroll demolished the dance hall that had burned down in 1948. In its place laid out a flat 1/5-mile oval track, pit area and grandstand alongside the Connecticut River. The first full season of &quot;modified&quot; stock car racing was 1949.

The track closed at the end of the 1999 season. Five-time track champion Bob Polverari won the final race, after which participants started digging up pieces of the track asphalt for souvenirs. In 2000 when the park re-opened as Six Flags New England, the race track was demolished and the DC Universe themed area (including the roller coaster Superman The Ride) was built in its place.

<text>Neuromeres are distinct groups of neural crest cells, forming segments in the neural tube of the early embryonic development of the brain. There are three classes of neuromeres in the central nervous system – prosomeres (for the prosencephalon), mesomeres (for the mesencephalon) and rhombomeres (for the rhombencephalon) that will develop the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain respectively.

Neuromeres can then be divided up so that each segment is carrying different and unique genetic traits, expressing different features in development.

Neuromeres were first discovered in the beginning of the 20th century. Although researchers have long since recognized the different signs of differentiation during embryonic development, it was widely thought that neuromeres held no relation to the structure of the nervous system. Swedish neuroembyrologists Bergquist and Kallen clarified the role of neuromeres by conducting several studies showing that neuromeres are important in the development of the nervous system. These experiments consisted of studying the brains of different vertebrates during their development period.

During embryonic development, neural crest cells from each neuromere prompt the development of the nerves and arteries, helping to support the development of craniofacial tissues. If gene expression goes wrong, it can have severe effects on the developing embryo, causing abnormalities like craniofacial clefts, also known as cleft palates. The anatomical boundaries of neuromeres are determined by the expression of unique genes known as Hox genes in a particular zone. The Hox genes contain the 183-bp homeobox, which encodes a particular portion of the Hox proteins called the homeodomain. The homeodomain can then bind to other portions of DNA to regulate gene expression. These genes determine the basic structure and orientation of an organism after the embryonic segments have formed. The neural crest cells that are found outside of a given neuromere will express the same proteins as the cells that are found inside the neural tube. The genes that are being expressed fall into two categories, extracellular signaling proteins and intracellular transcription factors. The genes are able to perform different tasks at different times depending on the environment that may or not be changing as well as when they are being activated and expressed.

The neural crest was first discovered by Wilhelm His in 1868 when he was studying the embryo of a chick. He first named it Zwischenstrang, which literally translated to mean “intermediate cord.” The name neural crest develops from the neural folds during embryonic development. This is where the neural plate folds in on itself, forming the neural crest. Neural crest cells will eventually become portions of the peripheral nervous system. During development, the neural tube is considered as the precursor to the spinal cord and the rest of the central nervous system.

The forebrain forms the six prosomeres, p1 to p6, which are then divided into two more categories, dorsal and ventral. The telencephalon forms from the dorsal parts of p6 and p5, where p6 becomes the olfactory system and p5 will coincide with the visual system. Mesomeres, m1 and m2, become the midbrain, which contains the superior and inferior colliculi. The 12 rhombomeres, which are numbered from r0 to r11, construct the hindbrain. The myelencephalon is made from rhombomeres r2 to r11, which also form the medulla. These rhombomeres are also associated with the neural crest that supplies the pharyngeal arches, a set of visible tissues that are in line with the developing brain and give rise to the head and neck.

== Spinal cord anatomy ==

Spinal segments are the part of the spinal cord, from which ventral and dorsal roots exit to form a specific pair of spinal nerves. The spinal cord is not segmented itself, it is only made into segments by the spinal nerves as they leave. 31 deferent segments exists in a human spinal cord:

=== 8 cervical segments ===

Cervical nerves exit above C1 segment and below C1-C7.
Note that this creates 8 nerves and segments corresponding to only 7 cervical vertebra.

=== 12 thoracic segments ===

Nerves exit below T1-T12.

=== 5 lumbar segments ===

Nerves exit below L1-L5.

=== 5 sacral segments ===

Nerves exit below S1-S5.

=== 1 coccygeal segment ===

Originally, during development there are two segments S1 and S2 which fuse. 
The nerves in this case exit at the coccyx.

=== In more detail ===

The spinal cord is the main pathway for information connecting the brain and peripheral nervous system. The length of the spinal cord is much shorter than the length of the bony spinal column. The human spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum and continues through to the conus medullaris near the second lumbar vertebra, terminating in a fibrous extension known as the filum terminale.

It is about 45 cm (18 in) long in men and around 43 cm (17 in) in women, ovoid-shaped, and is enlarged in the cervical and lumbar regions. The cervical enlargement, located from C3 to T2 spinal segments, is where sensory input comes from and motor output goes to the arms. The lumbar enlargement, located between L1 and S3 spinal segments, handles sensory input and motor output coming from and going to the legs.

The spinal cord is protected by three layers of tissue, called spinal meninges, that surround the canal. The dura mater is the outermost layer, and it forms a tough protective coating. Between the dura mater and the surrounding bone of the vertebrae is a space called the epidural space. The epidural space is filled with adipose tissue, and it contains a network of blood vessels. The arachnoid mater is the middle protective layer. Its name comes from the fact that the tissue has a spiderweb-like appearance. The space between the arachnoid and the underlying pia mater is called the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The medical procedure known as a lumbar puncture (or &quot;spinal tap&quot;) involves use of a needle to withdraw cerebrospinal fluid from the subarachnoid space, usually from the lumbar region of the spine. The pia mater is the innermost protective layer. It is very delicate and it is tightly associated with the surface of the spinal cord. The cord is stabilized within the dura mater by the connecting denticulate ligaments, which extend from the enveloping pia mater laterally between the dorsal and ventral roots. The dural sac ends at the vertebral level of the second sacral vertebra.

In cross-section, the peripheral region of the cord contains neuronal white matter tracts containing sensory and motor neurons. Internal to this peripheral region is the gray, butterfly-shaped central region made up of nerve cell bodies. This central region surrounds the central canal, which is an anatomic extension of the spaces in the brain known as the ventricles and, like the ventricles, contains cerebrospinal fluid.

The spinal cord has a shape that is compressed dorso-ventrally, giving it an elliptical shape. The cord has grooves in the dorsal and ventral sides. The posterior median sulcus is the groove in the dorsal side, and the anterior median fissure is the groove in the ventral side.

In the upper part of the vertebral column, spinal nerves exit directly from the spinal cord, whereas in the lower part of the vertebral column nerves pass further down the column before exiting. The terminal portion of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The pia mater continues as an extension called the filum terminale, which anchors the spinal cord to the coccyx. The cauda equina (“horse’s tail”) is the name for the collection of nerves in the vertebral column that continue to travel through the vertebral column below the conus medullaris. The cauda equina forms as a result of the fact that the spinal cord stops growing in length at about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in the fact that sacral spinal nerves actually originate in the upper lumbar region. The spinal cord can be anatomically divided into 31 spinal segments based on the origins of the spinal nerves.

Each segment of the spinal cord is associated with a pair of ganglia, called dorsal root ganglia, which are situated just outside the spinal cord. These ganglia contain cell bodies of sensory neurons. Axons of these sensory neurons travel into the spinal cord via the dorsal roots.

Ventral roots consist of axons from motor neurons, which bring information to the periphery from cell bodies within the CNS. Dorsal roots and ventral roots come together and exit the intervertebral foramina as they become spinal nerves.

The gray matter, in the center of the cord, is shaped like a butterfly and consists of cell bodies of interneurons and motor neurons. It also consists of neuroglia cells and unmyelinated axons. Projections of the gray matter (the “wings”) are called horns. Together, the gray horns and the gray commissure form the “gray H.”

The white matter is located outside of the gray matter and consists almost totally of myelinated motor and sensory axons. “Columns” of white matter carry information either up or down the spinal cord.

Within the CNS, nerve cell bodies are generally organized into functional clusters, called nuclei. Axons within the CNS are grouped into tracts.

There are 33 spinal cord nerve segments in a human spinal cord:

8 cervical segments forming 8 pairs of cervical nerves (C1 spinal nerves exit spinal column between occiput and C1 vertebra; C2 nerves exit between posterior arch of C1 vertebra and lamina of C2 vertebra; C3-C8 spinal nerves through IVF above corresponding cervica vertebra, with the exception of C8 pair which exit via IVF between C7 and T1 vertebra)

12 thoracic segments forming 12 pairs of thoracic nerves (exit spinal column through IVF below corresponding vertebra T1-T12)

5 lumbar segments forming 5 pairs of lumbar nerves (exit spinal column through IVF, below corresponding vertebra L1-L5)

5 sacral segments forming 5 pairs of sacral nerves (exit spinal column through IVF, below corresponding vertebra S1-S5)

3 coccygeal segments joined up becoming a single segment forming 1 pair of coccygeal nerves (exit spinal column through the sacral hiatus).

In the fetus, vertebral segments correspond with spinal cord segments. However, because the vertebral column grows longer than the spinal cord, spinal cord segments do not correspond to vertebral segments in the adult, particularly in the lower spinal cord. For example, lumbar and sacral spinal cord segments are found between vertebral levels T9 and L2, and the spinal cord ends around the L1/L2 vertebral level, forming a structure known as the conus medullaris.

Although the spinal cord cell bodies end around the L1/L2 vertebral level, the spinal nerves for each segment exit at the level of the corresponding vertebra. For the nerves of the lower spinal cord, this means that they exit the vertebral column much lower (more caudally) than their roots. As these nerves travel from their respective roots to their point of exit from the vertebral column, the nerves of the lower spinal segments form a bundle called the cauda equina.

There are two regions where the spinal cord enlarges:
Cervical enlargement - corresponds roughly to the brachial plexus nerves, which innervate the upper limb. It includes spinal cord segments from about C4 to T1. The vertebral levels of the enlargement are roughly the same (C4 to T1).
Lumbosacral enlargement - corresponds to the lumbosacral plexus nerves, which innervate the lower limb. It comprises the spinal cord segments from L2 to S3 and is found about the vertebral levels of T9 to T12.

==Embryology==
The spinal cord develops from part of the neural tube during development. As the neural tube begins to develop, the notochord begins to secrete a factor known as Sonic hedgehog or SHH. As a result, the floor plate then also begins to secrete SHH, and this will induce the basal plate to develop motor neurons.

Meanwhile, the overlying ectoderm secretes bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). This induces the roof plate to begin to secrete BMP, which will induce the alar plate to develop sensory neurons. The alar plate and the basal plate are separated by the sulcus limitans.

Additionally, the floor plate also secretes netrins. The netrins act as chemoattractants to decussation of pain and temperature sensory neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure, where they then ascend towards the thalamus.

The elimination of neuronal cells by programmed cell death (PCD) is necessary for the correct assembly of the nervous system.

<text>Prefab Sprout are an English pop/rock band from Witton Gilbert, County Durham who rose to fame during the 1980s. Formed in 1978 by brothers Paddy and Martin McAloon and joined by vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player Wendy Smith in 1982, they released their debut album &quot;Swoon&quot; to critical acclaim in 1984. Their subsequent albums, including 1985&#x27;s &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and 1990&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, have been described by Paul Lester of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;some of the most beautiful and intelligent records of their era&quot;. Frontman Paddy McAloon is regarded as one of the great songwriters of his time and the band have been credited with producing some of the &quot;most beloved&quot; pop music of the 1980s and 1990s.

Nine of their albums reached the top 40 on the UK Albums Chart and one of their singles, &quot;The King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The band&#x27;s other popular songs include &quot;When Love Breaks Down&quot; and &quot;Cars and Girls&quot;. The band has not played live since 2000. Starting from 2003, Paddy McAloon has retained the Prefab Sprout name as a solo project.

==Career==
===Early days (1977–1983)===
In 1977, brothers Paddy and Martin McAloon formed the Dick Diver Band. By 1978, the name had changed to Prefab Sprout, a name McAloon had created years earlier when, as he has said, &quot;all the groups had names like that&quot;. The band first played live in 1979, having been joined by drummer Michael Salmon.

The band recorded their first single &quot;Lions in My Own Garden (Exit Someone)&quot; b/w &quot;Radio Love&quot; on 25 February 1982, and self-released it on their own Candle Records (slogan: &quot;The wax that won&#x27;t get on your wick&quot;). Songwriter Paddy McAloon wanted a song title where the first letters of the words spelled out Limoges, the French city where his former girlfriend was studying at the time. Music journalist Stuart Maconie described the track as &quot;enigmatic, melancholy, tuneful and therefore perfect for a jobless literature graduate with girlfriend problems&quot;. Their lineup expanded shortly after to incorporate vocalist Wendy Smith, and they recorded a second single &quot;The Devil Has All the Best Tunes / Walk On&quot; that September.

===Peak commercial success (1983–1992)===
Prefab Sprout were signed by Keith Armstrong&#x27;s Kitchenware Records in March 1983, after Armstrong heard their music played in the Newcastle branch of HMV he managed. Their two singles were reissued by Kitchenware and attracted notice including praise from Elvis Costello.

Following the departure of Michael Salmon as drummer, the band recorded their debut album with session drummer Graham Lant in a 24-track studio in Edinburgh on a budget of £5,000. Entitled &quot;Swoon&quot; (an acronym for Songs Written Out Of Necessity), it was released on the Kitchenware label in March 1984. It was critically acclaimed, with several reviewers highlighting its unorthodox musical style and unconventional lyrics. and it reached No. 22 on the UK Albums Chart. The album attracted the attention of musician Thomas Dolby, who began producing a new batch of what McAloon would describe as simpler songs with the band. Graham Lant&#x27;s relationship with Prefab Sprout ended soon after recording of &quot;Swoon&quot;, so Neil Conti joined the band as drummer. The resulting album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; (released in America as &quot;Two Wheels Good&quot; in anticipation of displeasure from McQueen&#x27;s estate), was highly praised by critics and gave the band its first hit single on the UK Singles Chart, &quot;When Love Breaks Down&quot;.

The band&#x27;s next project was &quot;Protest Songs&quot;, a sparsely-produced and quickly recorded album intended for a limited release in late 1985. The album was put on hold by CBS so as not to stunt sales of &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, finally seeing release in 1989. In 1988, the band released their follow-up to &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, &quot;From Langley Park to Memphis&quot;. The album gave the band their biggest commercial success in the UK with the single &quot;The King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. The song is written from the perspective of a washed-up singer who had a one-hit wonder in the 1950s with a novelty song featuring the chorus &quot;Hot dog, jumping frog, Albuquerque&quot;. It reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, their only single to reach the Top 10. &quot;From Langley Park to Memphis&quot; included guest appearances from Stevie Wonder and Pete Townshend, and used multiple producers including Thomas Dolby, who could not commit to working on the entire album.

In 1990, &quot;&quot;, fully produced by Thomas Dolby, was nominated for a BRIT Award. Though the music was more accessible than their earlier material, the lyrics and subject matter remained characteristically oblique and suggestive. McAloon has alluded in interviews to several albums&#x27; worth of songs that he has written but are unreleased/unrecorded including amongst others, concept albums based on the life of Michael Jackson, the history of the world (&quot;Earth: The Story So Far&quot;) and a fictional superhero (&quot;Zorro the Fox&quot;).

Their greatest hits, &quot;A Life of Surprises: The Best of Prefab Sprout&quot;, gave them their biggest US hit, &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot;, which spent several weeks in the Top 10 on the dance chart. McAloon joked in the album liner notes about the band&#x27;s lack of touring over the past decade.

===Line-up changes (1997–2001)===

After a five-year hiatus, Prefab Sprout released their first new studio album since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Jordan&quot;, &quot;Andromeda Heights&quot;, in 1997. After its release, Wendy Smith left the band to pursue a new career as a voice instructor.

A double album anthology, the &quot;38 Carat Collection&quot; was released by CBS in 1999 as the group was leaving the record label. The group&#x27;s US label, Epic, belatedly reissued this set as &quot;The Collection&quot; in early 2001. To promote the compilation, in 2000 the band embarked on their first UK tour in ten years.

In 2001 the band, now reduced to Paddy and Martin McAloon, released &quot;The Gunman and Other Stories&quot;, a concept album themed on the American Wild West, produced by Tony Visconti. The opening track &quot;Cowboy Dreams&quot; was a hit for the British actor-singer Jimmy Nail. Though critically acclaimed, neither enjoyed major commercial success.

===Paddy McAloon solo project (2003–)===
After being diagnosed with a medical disorder that seriously impaired his vision, Paddy McAloon released the album &quot;I Trawl the Megahertz&quot; under his own name in 2003 on the EMI Liberty label. Fifteen years later, in autumn 2018, the album was reissued on Sony Music as a Prefab Sprout record, as originally intended.

In early 2007 a remastered edition of &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; was released in a two-CD package, containing new versions of eight of the songs from the original album, in different arrangements performed by McAloon on acoustic guitar.

Prefab Sprout&#x27;s first album of new material since 2001, &quot;Let&#x27;s Change the World with Music&quot;, was released on 7 September 2009. The album is actually a collection of McAloon solo demos originally recorded in the early 1990s, intended for an unmade full band Prefab Sprout album. Reviews in the UK press were favourable (e.g. 5/5 in &quot;The Times&quot;, 4/5 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 4/5 in &quot;Record Collector&quot;).

&quot;Crimson/Red&quot;, consisting of developed versions of tracks from the vaults, was released on 7 October 2013 on vinyl and CD on the Icebreaker records label. A limited edition box set with an interview CD was also released. The lead single was &quot;The Best Jewel Thief in the World&quot;. &quot;Crimson/Red&quot; was a solo project, with Paddy McAloon singing, playing and programming all of the music on the album on his own.

In a 2013 interview, McAloon explained that his health issues (in particular, the deterioration of his hearing and eyesight) now dictated the way in which Prefab Sprout music was recorded, making it impractical and even impossible for any other musicians to be involved, but that he remained fond of and grateful to his former bandmates.

On 3 March 2017, McAloon&#x27;s manager Keith Armstrong, one-time head of Kitchenware Records, posted a short clip on Instagram of McAloon performing a new song &quot;America&quot; to a camcorder; operated by McAloon himself. A longer version appears on Armstrong&#x27;s YouTube page.

On 8 November 2018, Rough Trade announced the availability of vinyl LP and CD versions of &quot;I Trawl the Megahertz&quot;, including a white vinyl special edition of 1000 copies. On the same day, Sony Music announced the release under their &quot;Legacy&quot; brand. The Sony press release notes that although this was originally a solo album, it is now fitting to classify it as a Prefab Sprout record.

Since 2023 bass player Martin McAloon has toured and performed Prefab Sprout material as a solo artist.

=== Unreleased material ===
Several interviews have described a significant vault of unreleased material, credited either to Prefab Sprout or to McAloon himself. &quot;Crimson/Red&quot; was based on tracks from the vault, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Change the World with Music&quot; was released in a form that was substantially similar to its 1993 demo form.

On 10 December 2018, Paddy McAloon featured in an interview on the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4. McAloon said that Sony would be making further releases, and that since 2013 he had been working on an album of unreleased material, &#x27;Femmes Mythologiques&#x27;, to be issued in September 2019. During the radio appearance, he played a segment of a song called &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.

==Band name==
Several inaccurate stories have circulated about the origins of the band&#x27;s unusual name. According to the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, the band&#x27;s name was a mondegreen from the song &quot;Jackson&quot; (&quot;We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout&quot;), misheard by frontman Paddy McAloon. McAloon has maintained that the name was entirely made-up, stating in a 1984 interview; &quot;I was asked about the name so many times I used to invent stories about it. The truth of the matter is that I made it up. Around that time all the groups were supposed to mean something ... and when you are 13 you think it&#x27;s profound, that there must be some secrecy. I liked the idea and so thought of two odd words, put them together and have kept it, basically because it reminds me of how I used to look at things&quot;.

<doc id="1043309" wikidata="Q7745964" url="?curid=1043309" title="The Last Record Album">
<text>The Last Record Album is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1975 on the Warner Bros. label.

== Background ==
The album title and cover illustration by Neon Park both allude to the 1971 film &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; as well as the title typography on the film&#x27;s poster, with Hollywood Boulevard turned into a desert leading to the apparent visual pun of the Hollywood Sign Jell-O mold &quot;dessert&quot;. At left, Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood has long since closed, but the famous Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre at right is still a landmark.

The album&#x27;s back cover includes the record&#x27;s lyrics. One song, &quot;Hi Roller,&quot; was marked out in black ink with the annotation &quot;Maybe Next Time&quot;. The song was indeed included on their next album &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot; (1977).

== Reception ==
Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;For a very short album – only eight songs – too many of the cuts fall flat. Those that succeed, however, are quite good, particularly Paul Barrère and Bill Payne&#x27;s gently propulsive &#x27;All That You Dream,&#x27; Lowell George&#x27;s beautiful &#x27;Long Distance Love,&#x27; and the sublime &#x27;Mercenary Territory&#x27; ... There are enough signs of Little Feat&#x27;s true character on &quot;The Last Record Album&quot; – the three previously mentioned songs are essential for any Feat fan – to make it fairly enjoyable, but it&#x27;s clear that the band is beginning to run out of steam.&quot;

The track &quot;Long Distance Love&quot; was placed at number 26 in John Peel&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Festive Fifty&quot;. The album was voted number 555 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010, after the death of Richie Hayward, Adam Sweeting commented:

==Cover versions==
*Carly Simon recorded a version of &quot;One Love Stand&quot; for her 1976 album &quot;Another Passenger&quot;.

*Elvis Costello recorded a version of &quot;Long Distance Love&quot; for the 2024 album &quot;Long Distance Love: A Sweet Relief Tribute to Lowell George&quot; by various artists.

<text>Sandy Bay is a prestigious suburb of the city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, located immediately south of the central business district and adjoining Battery Point. Sandy Bay is bordered by the Derwent River to the east and is known for its beaches, including Nutgrove Beach, Long Beach, and Lords Beach.

Sandy Bay is one of Hobart&#x27;s most affluent suburbs, home to some of Tasmania&#x27;s most expensive real estate. It also contains student accommodations near the University of Tasmania&#x27;s Sandy Bay campus and private schools, including Fahan School, The Hutchins School, and Mount Carmel College.

Sandy Bay is a key entry point to southern Hobart, connected by Sandy Bay Road, which runs from Davey Street to Taroona, where it becomes the Channel Highway. One of its most famous landmarks is the Wrest Point Hotel Casino, Australia’s first legal casino, opened in 1973.

==History==
The area now known as Sandy Bay was originally home to the Muwinina people. Early European settlers were granted land in the area in the early 19th century, with much of the land given to displaced Norfolk Islanders in 1808. Sandy Bay was known for its long beach, where horse races were held in the early 1800s. By the early 20th century, it had become an integral part of Hobart&#x27;s urban growth, officially becoming part of the City of Hobart in 1914.

===Sandy Bay Baths===
Situated on Marieville Esplanade, the Sandy Bay Baths, built in 1906, were a key open-sea recreational facility for locals. They provided an important public space for swimming and relaxation and were a fixture of Sandy Bay until their demolition in 1965 to make way for modern developments, including rowing sheds for private schools.
===Sandy Bay tram line===
The Sandy Bay tram line, inaugurated in 1893, connected the suburb to Hobart’s city centre via Macquarie Street and Sandy Bay Road, terminating at Long Beach. The tramline was an essential part of public transport until 1952, when trams were phased out and the route was taken over entirely by electric trolleybuses. These trolleybuses operated until the mid-1960s, after which motorbuses took over.

==Institutions and schools==
Sandy Bay is home to several prestigious institutions and schools including:

* The Fahan School: An all-girls private school offering education from Kindergarten to Year 12, founded in 1935.
* The Hutchins School: A leading boys&#x27; private school, also offering Kindergarten to Year 12 education.
* Mount Carmel College: A Catholic girls&#x27; school catering for students from Kindergarten to Year 10.
* Sandy Bay Infant School: A public school with a focus on early childhood education.
* Waimea Heights Primary School: A public primary school with a strong reputation for academic achievement and community involvement.
===University of Tasmania===
The University of Tasmania (UTAS) has a significant presence in Sandy Bay. Although many of its faculties are being relocated to Hobart&#x27;s central business district, the law school and STEM centre are staying at the Sandy Bay campus. The future of the broader campus remains a topic of debate, with various proposals for development, including housing.

==Wrest Point Hotel Casino==
Wrest Point Hotel Casino is a prominent landmark in Sandy Bay and is notable for being Australia&#x27;s first legal casino. Originally opened as a waterfront hotel in the 1930s, Wrest Point underwent significant changes in the early 1970s. Following the 1968 Tasmanian casino referendum, where voters narrowly approved the introduction of casino gambling, plans were set in motion to develop Wrest Point into a casino complex.

The development was led by Federal Hotels, and in 1973, Wrest Point Casino officially opened. The building’s design, featuring an octagonal tower, was created by architect Roy Grounds and has since become a defining feature of Sandy Bay’s skyline. The casino complex also includes a hotel, multiple dining venues, and entertainment facilities, making it a key destination for visitors to Hobart.

The introduction of the casino was seen as a means to boost Tasmania’s tourism industry, attracting visitors from across Australia and internationally. Wrest Point continues to operate as a major entertainment hub, hosting events, conferences, and leisure activities.

==Beaches==
Sandy Bay is home to several popular beaches along the Derwent River foreshore, making it a key destination for recreational water activities in Hobart.

* Nutgrove Beach: One of the most family-friendly beaches in the area, Nutgrove Beach is a popular spot for swimming, picnicking, and kayaking. It has a calm shoreline, ideal for families and children. Nearby, there are barbecue facilities, playgrounds, and the popular Long Beach Reserve.
* Long Beach: Located adjacent to Nutgrove Beach, Long Beach is another major recreational hub for locals and visitors. The beach is often used for stand-up paddleboarding, walking, and swimming. It also serves as the venue for various local events throughout the year.
* Lords Beach: A small steep beach located towards the northern end of Sandy Bay, Lords Beach is known for its imposing concrete sea wall, built to stop coastal erosion and raised jetties.
* Red Chapel Beach: Situated near Wrest Point, this beach provides views of the iconic Wrest Point Casino. Red Chapel Beach offers a more secluded experience compared to Nutgrove and Long Beach.

These beaches are a key feature of Sandy Bay&#x27;s lifestyle, attracting both locals and tourists alike for relaxation, exercise, and water sports.

<doc id="1043328" wikidata="Q7765788" url="?curid=1043328" title="The Speech of Polly Baker">
<text>&quot;The Speech of Polly Baker&quot; (1747) is the fictional story of a woman put on trial in 1747 for having an illegitimate child. She had been convicted five times in the past for this same crime. Each time, she said, the full blame was placed on her shoulders but not the father&#x27;s. In later versions, the story ends as she is set free and marries one of the magistrates in charge of her trial.

This story was actually written by Benjamin Franklin as a protest to the unfairness of the early judicial system charging women for having illegitimate children while not charging the fathers, although he did not disclose this until decades later; therefore Polly Baker is one of Franklin&#x27;s many aliases. Franklin himself had an illegitimate son named William Franklin. See Illegitimacy in fiction.

==The Speech of Polly Baker==

===Preface===

The speech of Polly Baker, before a Court of Judicature, at Connecticut near Boston in New England; where she was prosecuted the Fifth Time, for having a Bastard Child: Which influenced the Court to dispense with her Punishment, and induced one of her Judges to marry her the next day.

===Polly Baker&#x27;s speech===

May it please the Honourable Bench to indulge me a few Words: I am a poor unhappy Woman; who have no Money to Fee Lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it to get a tolerable Living. I shall not trouble your Honours with long Speeches; for I have not the presumption to expect, that you may, by any Means, be prevailed on to deviate in your Sentence from the Law, in my Favour. All I humbly hope is, that your Honours would charitably move the Governor’s Goodness on my Behalf, that my Fine may be remitted. This is the Fifth Time, Gentlemen, that I have been dragg’d before your Courts on the same Account; twice I have paid heavy Fines, and twice have been brought to public Punishment, for want of Money to pay those Fines. This may have been agreeable to the Laws; I do not dispute it: But since Laws are sometimes unreasonable in themselves, and therefore repealed; and others bear too hard on the Subject in particular Circumstances; and therefore there is left a Power somewhere to dispense with the Execution of them; I take the Liberty to say, that I think this Law, by which I am punished, is both unreasonable in itself, and particularly severe with regard to me, who have always lived an inoffensive Life in the Neighbourhood where I was born, and defy my Enemies (if I have any) to say I ever wrong’d Man, Woman, or Child. Abstracted from the Law, I cannot conceive (may it please your Honours) what the Nature of my Offence is. I have brought Five fine Children into the World, at the Risque of my Life: I have maintained them well by my own Industry, without burthening the Township, and could have done it better, if it had not been for the heavy Charges and Fines I have paid. Can it be a Crime (in the Nature of Things I mean) to add to the Number of the King’s Subjects, in a new Country that really wants People? I own I should think it rather a Praise worthy, than a Punishable Action. I have debauch’d no other Woman’s Husband, nor inticed any innocent Youth: These Things I never was charged with; nor has any one the least cause of Complaint against me, unless, perhaps the Minister, or the Justice, because I have had Children without being Married, by which they have miss’d a Wedding Fee. But, can even this be a Fault of mine? I appeal to your Honours. You are pleased to allow I don’t want Sense; but I must be stupid to the last Degree, not to prefer the honourable State of Wedlock, to the Condition I have lived in. I always was, and still am, willing to enter into it; I doubt not my Behaving well in it, having all the Industry, Frugality, Fertility, and Skill in Oeconomy, appertaining to a good Wife’s Character. I defy any Person to say I ever Refused an Offer of that Sort: On the contrary, I readily Consented to the only Proposal of Marriage that ever was made me, which was when I was a Virgin; but too easily confiding in the Person’s Sincerity that made it, I unhappily lost my own Honour, by trusting to his; for he got me with Child, and then forsook me: That very Person you all know; he is now become a Magistrate of this County; and I had hopes he would have appeared this Day on the Bench, and have endeavoured to moderate the Court in my Favour; then I should have scorn’d to have mention’d it; but I must Complain of it as unjust and unequal, that my Betrayer and Undoer, the first Cause of all my Faults and Miscarriages (if they must be deemed such) should be advanced to Honour and Power, in the same Government that punishes my Misfortunes with Stripes and Infamy. I shall be told, ’tis like, that were there no Act of Assembly in the Case, the Precepts of Religion are violated by my Transgressions. If mine, then, is a religious Offence, leave it, Gentlemen, to religious Punishments. You have already excluded me from all the Comforts of your Church Communion: Is not that sufficient? You believe I have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal Fire: Will not that be sufficient? What need is there, then, of your additional Fines and Whippings? I own, I do not think as you do; for, if I thought, what you call a Sin, was really such, I would not presumptuously commit it. But how can it be believed, that Heaven is angry at my having Children, when, to the little done by me towards it, God has been pleased to add his divine Skill and admirable Workmanship in the Formation of their Bodies, and crown’d it by furnishing them with rational and immortal Souls? Forgive me Gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly on these Matters; I am no Divine: But if you, great Men, (*) must be making Laws, do not turn natural and useful Actions into Crimes, by your Prohibitions. Reflect a little on the horrid Consequences of this Law in particular: What Numbers of procur’d Abortions! and how many distress’d Mothers have been driven, by the Terror of Punishment and public Shame, to imbrue, contrary to Nature, their own trembling Hands in the Blood of their helpless Offspring! Nature would have induc’d them to nurse it up with a Parent’s Fondness. ’Tis the Law therefore, ’tis the Law itself that is guilty of all these Barbarities and Murders. Repeal it then, Gentlemen; let it be expung’d for ever from your Books: And on the other hand, take into your wise Consideration, the great and growing Number of Batchelors in the Country, many of whom, from the mean Fear of the Expence of a Family, have never sincerely and honourably Courted a Woman in their Lives; and by their Manner of Living, leave unproduced (which I think is little better than Murder) Hundreds of their Posterity to the Thousandth Generation. Is not theirs a greater Offence against the Public Good, than mine? Compel them then, by a Law, either to Marry, or pay double the Fine of Fornication every Year. What must poor young Women do, whom Custom has forbid to sollicit the Men, and who cannot force themselves upon Husbands, when the Laws take no Care to provide them any, and yet severely punish if they do their Duty without them? Yes, Gentlemen, I venture to call it a Duty; ’tis the Duty of the first and great Command of Nature, and of Nature’s God, Increase and multiply: A Duty, from the steady Performance of which nothing has ever been able to deter me; but for its Sake, I have hazarded the Loss of the public Esteem, and frequently incurr’d public Disgrace and Punishment; and therefore ought, in my humble Opinion, instead of a Whipping, to have a Statue erected to my Memory.
== Themes and genre ==
On the surface &quot;The Speech of Polly Baker&quot; appears to be a light-hearted and &quot;amusing story&quot;. However, Franklin presents a protest against legislation that punished women for out-of-wedlock sexual relations by imposing fines and whippings while the father of the child went without punishment. Through her use of rhetorical questions to the magistrates, Franklin shows the inequity of the prevailing justice system.

Franklin creates a sympathetic fictional character in Polly Baker. According to literary critic Etta Madden, Baker&#x27;s assertion that she&#x27;s worthy of a statue in the town square reflects and mocks &quot;Mather&#x27;s memorializing of saints in his &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot;&quot; as well as the execution sermons Puritans espoused to make &quot;lessons of wayward females.&quot; Furthermore, Madden explains that Baker&#x27;s rational speech shows echoes of Anne Hutchinson, although some might not find her speech rational at all. Therefore, Madden argues, the piece shows more complexity than is initially apparent. Another critic (Aldridge) argues that if taken out of the context of American literature, &quot;The Speech of Polly Baker&quot; can be considered as a &quot;universal myth along the lines of Don Juan and Faust.&quot;

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Speech of Polly Baker&quot; was first published in the April issue of The London Magazine or May 1747 in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It was also published in 17 April 1747 edition of the &quot;Derby Mercury&quot; and 18 April 1747 edition of the &quot;Newcastle Courant&quot;. In both of these it was presented without comment, leaving the reader to assume it was a genuine court report. The Derby Mercury stated they had the report &quot;from the General and St James&#x27;s Evening Posts &amp;c, April 16th 1747&quot;.

Initially the piece was published anonymously, but in 1905 it was included in &quot;The Writings of Benjamin Franklin&quot;, although the editor had yet to prove Franklin&#x27;s authorship. Max Hall, in &quot;Benjamin Franklin and Polly Baker: The History of a Literary Deception&quot; (1960) proved conclusively that Franklin wrote the piece, a conclusion accepted by scholars.

<doc id="1043340" wikidata="Q2540785" url="?curid=1043340" title="Waiting for Columbus">
<text>Waiting for Columbus is the first live album by the band Little Feat, recorded during seven performances in 1977. The first four shows were held at the Rainbow Theatre in London on August 1–4, 1977. The final three shows were recorded the following week at George Washington University&#x27;s Lisner Auditorium in Washington, D.C., on August 8–10. Local Washington radio personality Don &quot;Cerphe&quot; Colwell can be heard leading the audience in a &quot;F-E-A-T&quot; spellout in between the first (&quot;Join the Band&quot;) and second (&quot;Fat Man in the Bathtub&quot;) tracks.

The band were backed by the Tower of Power horn section with whom they had recorded for their 1974 album &quot;Feats Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot;. The result was one of their biggest selling albums.

Many of their more well-known songs were either re-worked or extended. For instance, one of their signature songs, &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;, was heavily extended to include a lengthy piano solo by keyboardist Bill Payne, a Dixieland horn arrangement and finally a dual guitar jam between the band&#x27;s two guitarists, Lowell George and Paul Barrère. In some cases, songs such as &quot;Rocket in My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Mercenary Territory&quot; were re-worked to include the horn section, and Little Feat additionally covered such tunes as Fraternity of Man&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Bogart That Joint&quot; and Allen Toussaint&#x27;s &quot;On Your Way Down&quot; (which had also appeared on 1973&#x27;s &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; album). Former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor makes a guest appearance playing slide guitar on &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot;.

The band recorded and mixed enough material from these performances for a triple LP, but for marketing reasons kept it to a double album. Three of the unused tracks were included on their 1981 album &quot;Hoy-Hoy!&quot;. All were eventually released on the 2002 &quot;Deluxe edition&quot; CD.

It was voted number 804 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

The cover art, by Neon Park, depicts items from the Americas unknown to Europeans before Columbus: an anthropomorphic tomato on a hammock in front of a backdrop of American native foliage and cactus.

==Track listing==
===1978 double LP===

===Vinyl reissue LPs===
There have been two different half-speed mastered vinyl reissues on LP, both on the Mobile Fidelity label and containing the original full track list. The first reissue was released not long after the original Warner Brothers LP, was mastered by Stan Ricker, MFSL 2-013, and pressed by JVC in Japan and features a GOLD banner on the cover. The other is a 2011 release on Warner Brothers Records. This version is MFSL 2-322. It was mastered by Shawn R. Britton and pressed on 180g vinyl by Record Technology Incorporated in Camarillo, CA. This version features a GREEN banner the cover.

In order to fit the double LP onto one CD, the tracks &quot;Don&#x27;t Bogart That Joint&quot; and &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot; were omitted from this release, but included as additional tracks on the CD issue of &quot;The Last Record Album&quot;.
===2002 &quot;deluxe edition&quot; double CD===
This release now contains all the songs that were performed at the series of shows recorded for this album.
From the Rhino reissue liner notes (p. 23):
*Disc 1 (all) &amp; Disc 2, Tracks 1–5: From the original release of &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot;. [Note: For aesthetic reasons, the playing order of Sides 2 (tks 9–12) &amp; 3 (tks 6–8) has been switched so that the band&#x27;s main set (contained on Disc 1) now concludes with the long ovation that leads into the encore.]
*Disc 2 Tracks 6–10: Performances that were refurbished &amp; mixed for the original album, but not used.
*Disc 2 Tracks 11–12: Selections that were apparently never considered for inclusion on either the original album or &quot;Hoy-Hoy!&quot;. They are newly mixed from the original multitrack tapes and do not contain any overdubs.
*Disc 2 Tracks 13–15: First issued on the album &quot;Hoy-Hoy!&quot;.

=== 2022 &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; eight CD box set ===
On 29 July 2022, Rhino released an eight disc &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; of &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot;. It contained the two shows used for the original 1977 album in their entirety, plus a previously unreleased live show recorded at Manchester City Hall.

<text>Oak Bay is a municipality incorporated in 1906 that is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is one of thirteen member municipalities of the Capital Regional District, and is bordered to the west by the city of Victoria and to the north by the district of Saanich. It is an eastern residential suburb of Victoria. 

==History==

Oak Bay is part of the traditional territories of the Coast Salish people of the Songhees First Nation. The people that came and went in the millennia before are unknown. Evidence of their ancient settlements has been found along local shores, including Willows Beach, where an ancient Lkwungen seaport known as Sitchanalth was centred around the mouth of the river commonly known as Bowker Creek. Sitchanalth is hypothesized to have been destroyed by the great Tsunami of 930 AD. Much of this neighbourhood is built upon an Indigenous burial ground.

Oak Bay takes its name from the Garry oak tree, which is found throughout the region, and also the name of the large bay on the eastern shore of the municipality, fronting onto Willows Beach.

John Tod, in 1850, built on a farm that is today the oldest continuously-occupied home in Western Canada. Tod was the Chief Fur Trader for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company for Kamloops, one of the original appointed members of BC&#x27;s Legislative Council.
Originally developed as a middle class streetcar suburb of Victoria, Oak Bay was incorporated as a municipality in 1906. Its first Council included Francis Rattenbury, the architect who designed the Legislative Buildings and Empress Hotel located on the inner harbour in Victoria. Rattenbury&#x27;s own home on Beach Drive is now used as the junior campus for Glenlyon Norfolk School. In 1912, the former farm lands of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were subdivided to create the Uplands area, but development was hampered by the outbreak of World War I. After the war, development of expensive homes in the Uplands was accompanied by the construction of many more single-family dwellings in the Estevan, Willows and South Oak Bay neighbourhoods.

The Victoria Golf Club is located in South Oak Bay. It was founded in 1893, and is the second oldest golf course west of the Great Lakes. It is a 6,120 yard links course on the ocean side, and claims to be the oldest golf course in Canada still on its original site. The course is reported to be haunted.

The Royal Victoria Yacht Club was formed on June 8, 1892, and moved in 1912 to its current location, at the location of the old Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company cattle wharf.

In 1925, the Victoria Cougars won the Stanley Cup at the Patrick Arena in Oak Bay, defeating the Montreal Canadiens in four games. The arena was soon after destroyed by fire in 1929. Nowadays, the Victoria Cougars are the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League.

The Oak Bay Marina, built in 1962, was officially opened in April 1964. It replaced the Oak Bay Boat House built in 1893. The breakwater was built in 1959 and funded by the federal government.

There have reportedly been sightings of a sea monster known as the Cadborosaurus off Oak Bay, with both reports dating back to before European settlement in the area.

<doc id="1043351" wikidata="Q510138" url="?curid=1043351" title="Coverture">
<text>Coverture was a legal doctrine in English common law originating from the French word &quot;couverture&quot;, meaning &quot;covering&quot;, in which a married woman&#x27;s legal existence was considered to be merged with that of her husband. Upon marriage, she had no independent legal existence of her own, in keeping with society&#x27;s expectation that her husband was to provide for and protect her. Under coverture a woman became a , whose legal rights and obligations were mostly subsumed by those of her husband. An unmarried woman, or , retained the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. 

Coverture was well established in the common law for several centuries and was inherited by many other common law jurisdictions, including the United States. According to historian Arianne Chernock, coverture did not apply in Scotland, but whether it applied in Wales is unclear.

After the rise of the women&#x27;s rights movement in the mid-19th century, coverture was increasingly criticised as oppressive, hindering women from exercising ordinary property rights and entering professions. Coverture was first substantially modified by late-19th-century Married Women&#x27;s Property Acts passed in various common-law jurisdictions, and was weakened and eventually eliminated by later reforms. Certain aspects of coverture (mainly concerned with preventing a wife from unilaterally incurring major financial obligations for which her husband would be liable) survived as late as the 1960s in some states of the United States.

== Principle ==
Under traditional English common law, an adult unmarried woman was considered to have the legal status of &quot;feme sole&quot;, while a married woman had the status of &quot;feme covert&quot;. These terms are English spellings of medieval Anglo-Norman phrases (the modern standard French spellings would be &quot;femme seule&quot; &quot;single woman&quot; and &quot;femme couverte&quot;, literally &quot;covered woman&quot;).

The principle of coverture was described in William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; in the late 18th century:

A &quot;feme sole&quot; had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name, while a &quot;feme covert&quot; was not recognized as having legal rights and obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects. Instead, through marriage a woman&#x27;s existence was incorporated into that of her husband, so that she had very few recognized individual rights of her own. As expressed in Hugo Black&#x27;s dissent in &quot;United States v. Yazell&quot;, &quot;This rule [coverture] has worked out in reality to mean that though the husband and wife are one, the one is the husband.&quot; A married woman could not own property, sign legal documents or enter into a contract, obtain an education against her husband&#x27;s wishes, or keep a salary for herself. If a wife was permitted to work, under the laws of coverture, she was required to relinquish her wages to her husband. On the other hand, a &quot;feme couvert&quot; could not be sued or sue in her own name. In certain cases, a wife did not have individual legal liability for her misdeeds since it was legally assumed that she was acting under the orders of her husband, and generally a husband and a wife were not allowed to testify either for or against each other.

A queen of England, whether she was a queen consort or a queen regnant, was generally exempted from the legal requirements of coverture, as understood by Blackstone.

== History ==

The system of &quot;feme sole&quot; and &quot;feme covert&quot; developed in England in the High and Late Middle Ages as part of the common law system, which had its origins in the legal reforms of Henry II and other medieval English kings. Medieval legal treatises, such as that famously known as Bracton, described the nature of coverture and its impact on married women&#x27;s legal actions. Bracton states that husband and wife were a single person, being one flesh and one blood, a principle known as &#x27;unity of person&#x27;. Husbands also wielded power over their wives, being their rulers and custodians of their property.

While it was once assumed that married women had little or no access to legal recourse, as a result of coverture, historians have more recently complicated our knowledge of coverture in the Middle Ages through various studies of married women&#x27;s legal status across different courts and jurisdictions. Collectively, many of these studies have argued that &#x27;there has been a tendency to overplay the extent to which coverture applied&#x27;, as legal records reveal that married women could possess rights over property, could take part in business transactions, and interact with the courts. In medieval post-conquest Wales, it has been suggested that coverture only applied in certain situations. Married women were responsible for their own actions in criminal presentments and defamation, but their husbands represented them in litigation for abduction and in interpersonal pleas.

The extent of coverture in medieval England has also been qualified by the existence of &quot;femme sole&quot; customs that existed in some medieval English towns. This granted them independent commercial and legal rights as if they were single. This practice is outlined in the custumal of Henry Darcy, Lord Mayor of London in the 1330s, allowing married women working independently of their husband to act as a single woman in all matters concerning her craft, such as renting a shop and suing and being sued for debt. The custom is known to have been adopted in a number of other towns, including Bristol, Lincoln, York, Sandwich, Rye, Carlisle, Chester and Exeter. Some North American British colonies also adopted this custom in the eighteenth century. However, it is unclear how many women took up this status, the extent to which it was legally enforced, or whether the legal and commercial independence it offered were advantageous.

According to Chernock, &quot;coverture, ... [a 1777] author ... concluded, was the product of foreign Norman invasion in the eleventh century—not, as Blackstone would have it, a time-tested &#x27;English&#x27; legal practice. This was a reading of British history, then, that put a decidedly feminist twist on the idea of the &#x27;Norman yoke. Also according to Chernock, &quot;the Saxons, ... [Calidore] boasted, had encouraged women to &#x27;retain separate property&#x27;— ... a clear blow to coverture.&quot; Chernock claims that &quot;as the historical accounts of the laws regarding women had indicated, coverture was a policy not just foreign in its origins but also suited to particular and now remote historical conditions.&quot; Coverture may not have existed in &quot;the Anglo-Saxon constitution&quot;.

Coverture also held sway in English-speaking colonies because of the influence of the English common law there. The way in which coverture operated across the common law world has been the subject of recent studies examining the subordinating effects of marriage for women across medieval and early modern England and North America, in a variety of legal contexts. It has been argued that in practice, most of the rules of coverture &quot;served not to guide every transaction but rather to provide clarity and direction in times of crisis or death.&quot; Despite this flexibility, coverture remained a powerful tool of marital inequality for many centuries.

===Criticism===
Early feminist historian Mary Ritter Beard held the view that much of the severity of the doctrine of coverture was actually due to Blackstone and other late systematizers rather than due to a genuine old common-law tradition.

In March 1776, Abigail Adams saw an opportunity in the language of natural rights, and wrote to her husband, John Adams:

She was not writing generally about women&#x27;s rights, nor specifically about the right to vote. She was asking for relief from coverture. John responded, &quot;I cannot but laugh.&quot;

According to Chernock, &quot;late Enlightenment radicals ... argued ... [that &#x27;coverture&#x27; and other &#x27;principles&#x27;] did not reflect the &#x27;advancements&#x27; of a modern, civilized society. Rather, they were markers of past human errors and inconsistencies, and thus in need of further revision.&quot; Chernock claimed that &quot;as the editor of Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, [Edward] Christian used his popular thirteenth edition, published in 1800, to highlight the ways in which the practice of coverture might be modified.&quot; Chernock wrote that &quot;Christian ... proceeded to recommend that a husband cease to be &#x27;absolutely master of the profits of the wife&#x27;s lands during the coverture. Chernock reported that other men sought for coverture to be modified or eliminated.
According to Ellen Carol DuBois, &quot;the initial target of women&#x27;s rights protest was the legal doctrine of &#x27;coverture. The earliest American women&#x27;s rights lecturer, John Neal attacked coverture in speeches and public debates as early as 1823, but most prominently in the 1840s, asking &quot;how long [women] shall be rendered by law incapable of acquiring, holding, or transmitting property, except under special conditions, like the slave?&quot; In the 1850s, according to DuBois, Lucy Stone criticized &quot;the common law of marriage because it &#x27;gives the &quot;custody&quot; of the wife&#x27;s person to her husband, so that he has a right to her even against herself. Stone kept her premarital family name after marriage as a protest &quot;against all manifestations of coverture&quot;. DuBois continued, &quot;in the 1850s, ... primarily legal goal [of &#x27;the American women&#x27;s rights movement&#x27;] was the establishment of basic property rights for women once they were married, which went to the core of the deprivations of coverture.&quot; Chernock continued, &quot;for those who determined that legal reforms were the key to achieving a more enlightened relationship between the sexes, coverture was a primary object of attention.&quot;

DuBois wrote that coverture, because of property restrictions with the vote, &quot;played a major role in&quot; influencing the effort to secure women&#x27;s right to vote in the U.S., because one view was that the right should be limited to women who owned property when coverture excluded most women (relatively few were unmarried or widowed), while another view was for the right to be available for all women.

In the mid-19th century, according to Melissa J. Homestead, coverture was criticized as depriving married women authors of the financial benefits of their copyrights, including analogizing to slavery; one woman poet &quot;explicitly analogized her legal status as a married woman author to that of an American slave.&quot; According to Homestead, feminists also criticized the effect of coverture on rights under patents held by married women.

Hendrik Hartog counter-criticized that coverture was only a legal fiction and not descriptive of social reality and that courts applying equity jurisdiction had developed many exceptions to coverture, but, according to Norma Basch, the exceptions themselves still required that the woman be dependent on someone and not all agreements between spouses to let wives control their property were enforceable in court.

In 1869, coverture was criticized when Myra Bradwell was refused permission to practice as a lawyer in Illinois specifically because of coverture. In 1871, Bradwell argued to the Supreme Court that coverture violated the Constitution&#x27;s 14th Amendment. According to Margot Canaday, &quot;coverture&#x27;s main purpose ... was the legal subordination of women.&quot; Canaday continued, &quot;women&#x27;s legal subordination through marriage ... was maintained in fact across [coverture]&quot;.

According to Canaday, &quot;coverture was diminished ... in the 1970s, as part of a broader feminist revolution in law that further weakened the principle that a husband owned a wife&#x27;s labor (including her person). ... The regime of coverture ... was coming undone [in the mid-20th century]&quot;. In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court said &quot;the institution of coverture is ... obsolete&quot; even while acknowledging coverture&#x27;s existence in 1–11 states. In a separate opinion in the same case, Hugo Black and two others of the nine justices said the &quot;fiction that the husband and wife are one... in reality ... that though the husband and wife are one, the one is the husband...[,] rested on ... a ... notion that a married woman, being a female, is without capacity to make her own contracts and do her own business&quot;, a notion that Black &quot;had supposed is ... completely discredited&quot;. Black described modern (as of 1966) coverture as an &quot;archaic remnant of a primitive caste system&quot;. Canaday wrote, &quot;the application of equal protection law to marital relations finally eviscerated the law of coverture&quot; and &quot;coverture unraveled with accelerating speed [in the late 20th century]&quot;. &quot;Coverture&#x27;s demise blunted (even if it did not eliminate) male privilege within marriage&quot;, according to Canaday.

=== Abolition ===
This situation continued until the mid-to-late 19th century, when married women&#x27;s property acts started to be passed in many English-speaking jurisdictions, setting the stage for further reforms.

In the United States, many states passed Married Women&#x27;s Property Acts to eliminate or reduce the effects of coverture. Nineteenth-century courts in the United States also enforced state privy examination laws. A privy examination was an American legal practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document. This practice was seen as a means to protect married women&#x27;s property from overbearing husbands. Other states abolished the concept through court cases, for example: California in &quot;Follansbee v. Benzenberg&quot; (1954). The abolition of coverture has been seen as &quot;one of the greatest extensions of property rights in human history&quot;, and one that led to a number of positive financial and economic impacts. Specifically, it led to shifts in household portfolios, a positive shock to the supply of credit, and a reallocation of labor towards non-agriculture and capital intensive industries.

As recently as 1972, two US states allowed a wife accused in criminal court to offer as a legal defense that she was obeying her husband&#x27;s orders.

== Analogous concepts outside the common law system ==
In the Roman-Dutch law, the marital power was a doctrine very similar to the doctrine of coverture in the English common law. Under the marital power doctrine, a wife was legally a minor under the guardianship of her husband.

Under the Napoleonic Code – which was very influential both inside and outside of Europe – married women and children were subordinated to the husband&#x27;s/father&#x27;s authority. Married French women obtained the right to work without their husband&#x27;s consent in 1965. In France, the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children&#x27;s property. Neighboring Switzerland was one of the last European countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women&#x27;s rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, came into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 in a referendum, with 54.7% votes in favor).

In 1979, Louisiana became the last of the states of the U.S. to have its Head and Master law struck down. An appeal made it to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1980, and in the following year the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Kirchberg v. Feenstra&quot; effectively declared the practice of male rule in marriage unconstitutional, generally favoring instead a co-administration model.

== Outside the legal realm ==
The doctrine of coverture carried over into English heraldry, in which there were established traditional methods of displaying the coat of arms of an unmarried woman, displaying the coat of arms of a widow, or displaying the combined coat of arms of a couple jointly, but no accepted method of displaying the coat of arms of a married woman separately as an individual.

The traditional practice by which a woman relinquished her name and adopted her husband&#x27;s name (e.g., &quot;Mrs. John Smith&quot;) is similarly a representation of coverture, although usually symbolic rather than legal in form.

In some cultures, particularly in the Anglophone West, wives often change their surnames to that of their husbands upon getting married. Although this procedure is today optional, for some it remains a controversial practice due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture or to other similar doctrines in civil law systems, and to the historically subordinated roles of wives; while others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice. Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women&#x27;s rights, and have restricted or banned it; for example, since 1983, when Greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses, people in Greece are &quot;required&quot; to keep their birth names for their whole life, although they may add their spouse&#x27;s name to their own, and they may petition for a name change for &quot;serious&quot; reasons.

== Cultural references ==
The phrase &quot;the law is an ass&quot; was popularized by Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, when the character Mr. Bumble is informed that &quot;the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction&quot;. Mr. Bumble replies, &quot;if the law supposes that ... the law is a ass – a idiot. If that&#x27;s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experience – by experience.&quot;

The television show &quot;Frontier House&quot; follows three families who are trying to survive six months in the Montana countryside, including growing their own crops and surviving the winter. It takes place during presidency of Abraham Lincoln, who was president when the Homestead Act of 1862 became law. During the show it is noted that coverture was still in effect, so only single women could claim land under the Homestead Act, because married women lost most of their rights.

<text>The Fournier RF-9 is a two-seat motorglider of conventional sailplane configuration. Originally produced in France, manufacturing was later taken over by ABS Aircraft in Switzerland, and then by Gomolzig in Germany. The pilot and passenger are accommodated side-by-side, and the aircraft&#x27;s wings are foldable for ease of storage. It first flew in 1977. The licence-built example was known as the Fournier RF-9 ABS but only one, registration D-KHGO (w/nr.9021) was ever constructed. In 1994, ABS Aircraft GmbH left the development of ABS RF-9 though two further kits had been built, and were later constructed by the Polish Aircraft company Polavia.

<text>Zoomusicology () is the study of the musical aspects of sound and communication as produced and perceived by animals. It is a field of musicology and zoology, and is a type of zoosemiotics. Zoomusicology as a field dates to François-Bernard Mâche&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Music, Myth, and Nature, or the Dolphins of Arion&quot; (published in English in 1992), and has been developed more recently by scholars such as Dario Martinelli, David Rothenberg, Hollis Taylor, David Teie, and Emily Doolittle.

Zoomusicology is a separate field from ethnomusicology, the study of human music.

Zoomusicologists in a wide range of fields including music, semiotics, philosophy and biology conduct zoomusicology research. This is because the field of zoomusicology is so broad and reaches many disciplines. Musician and zoomusicologist Hollis Taylor has conducted an extensive study of the Pied Butcherbird (&quot;Cracticus nigrogularis&quot;) over the past 15 years, including interdisciplinary research with philosophers and scientists. Clarinetist, and philosopher David Rothenberg plays music with animals, and has written books on the relationship between bird, insect, and whale song and human music. Composer Emily Doolittle has written numerous pieces based on animal songs, and has published interdisciplinary music-science research on the hermit thrush and the musician wren. Heavy metal bands such as Hatebeak, Caninus, Naegleria Fowleri, and Boar Glue have released music fronted by a grey parrot, a pit bull, an Amazon parrot, and a guinea pig, respectively. Susan Belanger has also contributed to the field of zoomusicology, with her work on soft song in the Asian corn borer moth (&quot;Ostrinia furnacalis&quot;) and its relationship to the initiation of mating behaviour. Researcher Patricia Gray has examined the music that can be seen in whales and songbirds. This list is by no means all encompassing, but simply lists some notable members of the zoomusicology research community.

==Human-animal interactions==
There have been several musicians over the years who have performed with or for animals, hoping to elicit responses. Examples include: the song &quot;Seamus&quot; from Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot; featuring Steve Marriott&#x27;s Border Collie Seamus howling along to an acoustic blues song. The performance was repeated in &quot;Mademoiselle Nobs&quot; for the film &quot;Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii&quot; (1972) with a different dog, Nobs. Paul Horn played flute to Haida, an orca living at Sealand of the Pacific in Victoria, British Columbia on his album &quot;Inside II&quot; (1972), though the response was merely spyhopping. Paul Winter played his saxophone for both wolves (who howled) and gray whales (who did not) on his album &quot;Common Ground&quot; (1978). Composer Jim Nollman plays guitar and wooden flute to such species as whales, wolves and turkeys. David Rothenberg, a clarinetist, has played to humpback whales, cicadas and birds (2005-2013) with no apparent response.

Composer David Sulzer, under the name David Soldier and the Thai Elephant Orchestra, built giant percussion instruments for the elephants at the National Elephant Institute at Lampang to play, with minimal human direction.

Composers have long evoked or imitated animal sounds in compositions, including Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)&quot; (1720), Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;The Hen&quot; (1728), Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; (1886), Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; (1895), Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring&quot; (1912), Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Lark Ascending (Vaughan Williams)&quot; (1914), Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (1928), Ferde Grofé&#x27;s &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; (1931), Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of the Birds&quot; (1956–58), George Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Vox Balaenae&quot; (Voice of the Whale) (1971), and Pauline Oliveros&#x27;s &quot;El Relicario de los Animales&quot; (1977).

Some modern composers have included recordings of animals in their scores, including Alan Hovhaness&#x27;s &quot;And God Created Great Whales&quot; (1970), Einojuhani Rautavaara&#x27;s &quot;Cantus Arcticus&quot; (1972), Gabriel Pareyon&#x27;s &quot;Invention over the song of the Vireo atriccapillus&quot; (1999) and &quot;Kha Pijpichtli Kuikatl&quot; (2003).

In 1960 American engineer Jim Fassett put together an album of slowed-down and re-arranged bird songs called &quot;Symphony of the Birds&quot;. Novelty songs pieced together from the sounds of dogs (The Singing Dogs) or cats (Jingle Cats) enjoyed brief popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. Field recording expert Bernie Krause in 1988 released a single (&quot;Jungle Shoes&quot;/&quot;Fish Wrap&quot;) and an album (&quot;Gorillas in the Mix&quot;) of songs composed of animal and nature sounds. The Indian zoomusicologist, A. J. Mithra composed music using bird, animal and frog sounds from 2008 until his death in 2014. In that same year, New York beatboxing artist Ben Mirin began incorporating animal sounds into his beats.

== Music produced by animals ==
=== Birds ===

The most well-known form of music found in non-human animals is birdsong. Birdsong is different from normal calls. For example, a call will usually simply function to communicate a direct message. For instance, a bird call could be used to direct attention that a predator is near. Meanwhile, a song contains more repetition and usually will have distinct structure to it, with a specific beginning, middle, and end. In many species of songbirds, songs seem to be used both as a way to attract potential mates, as well as to mark and defend one&#x27;s territory. It has been observed that young songbirds acquire their ability to produce song from imitation of adult birds. There seems to be a critical period for song learning. In one experiment, they compared birds raised in isolation, (this involved isolation from other birds as well as the vocalizations of other birds), with those raised in a colony, without these forms of isolation. Using an fMRI scan and the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) as a measurement of brain activity, it was found that birds raised in the isolation condition did not appear to show a preference between their own songs and a repetitive song. Meanwhile, colony-raised birds showed a stronger reaction to their own song being played back.

===Mimicry===
Several species of birds can mimic the songs of other birds, or even mechanical sounds. These include, with varying degrees of success, starlings, mockingbirds, thrashers, crows and ravens, parrots, myna birds, blue jays, lyrebirds, Lawrence&#x27;s thrushes, &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;, marsh warblers, and others. Mozart kept a starling that could mimic some of his music.

== Functions and effects of music on animals ==
=== Mammals ===

Snowden and Teie performed an experiment on Cotton-top tamarins (&quot;Saguinus oedipus&quot;) to determine if music would lead to behavioural changes, and whether music made by other species would elicit similar behavioural responses as the music of one&#x27;s own species. This experiment involved two separate categories of music - one was affiliation-based, the other was fear/threat-based music. Within the two categories, the experimenter varied whether the music was produced by humans or tamarins. During the experiment, a baseline behaviour measurement was established, proceeded by the experimental condition, which was a piece of music that was played for 30 seconds. Following this, behaviour was analyzed for a total of five minutes. This analysis was made by an observer who was unaware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, and simply noted different behaviours which they had witnessed. The experimenters found that the tamarins altered their behaviour specifically when listening to tamarin music. For example, when music from the affiliation condition was played, the behavioural response of the tamarins involved a decrease in overall movement and an increase in both social and foraging behaviour. This contrasted the behaviour observed when the fear/threat based music was played. During this condition, the tamarins were more likely to move around and show anxiety-based behaviour, as well as, an increase in social behaviour similar to that seen in the affiliation condition. Although the tamarins did not show behavioural changes to human music as clearly as they did to their species-specific music, there was some behavioural change. The tamarins showed decreased movement when listening to human fear/threat based music and a decrease in anxious behaviour when listening to human affiliation music.
Humpback whales (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) are capable of the production of complex songs. These songs are amongst some of the longest measured in animals. Only male humpback whales perform these vocalizations; it was initially hypothesized that these songs may be a part of the sexual selection process. This point however, is unclear. It has been found that males only began their song after joining a group where pairs of mother and calf were present. Although the reason behind this behaviour is uncertain, some have hypothesized that the songs produced by male humpback whales may be a part of escorting, or accompanying females. Singing can be a costly behaviour, because it can lead to more attention being drawn. In the humpback whales&#x27; situation, their singing can attract other competing males. Yet, the singing behaviour continues and therefore, it is assumed that the songs are critical to the courtship behaviour of the humpback whales.

=== Insects ===

One potential barrier in the study of zoomusicology is that there are some forms of music produced by various animals that humans are incapable of hearing. This music is very low in amplitude and is known as quiet song, whisper communication, or soft song. This low amplitude music has been shown in birds, as well as insects and is linked to behaviour. Moth species have been shown to have developed the ability to communicate using ultrasonic sounds, and this ability has transferred over to their production of soft songs. In the Asian corn borer moth (&quot;Ostrinia furnacalis&quot;) males produce an ultrasonic soft song to initiate courtship behaviour. The song that the male produces is so quiet that the female must be within a range of three centimeters in order to hear the song. In hearing the song, the female stays in one place and is completely still; this allows the male to initiate mating behaviour. The reason that the female remains still is because the song sounds very similar to sounds that a bat would produce. The female therefore remains still in order to avoid potential predation. There is another added benefit to this soft song produced by the male Asian corn borer moth, and that is that the song is so quiet that it decreases the males&#x27; predation risk. Although these soft songs are far less well known to the general public, they are an important aspect of zoomusicology and the further understanding of animal behaviour.

== Auditory enrichment and therapeutic effects of music on animals ==
=== Cats ===
David Teie has created two albums of music for cats. Researchers Snowdon and Savage found that domestic cats that showed little interest in human music are more interested in and responsive to Teie&#x27;s music that was composed with species-appropriate features relevant to cats. The authors of a clinical study of Teie&#x27;s music for cats in veterinary physical examinations concluded that cat-specific music may benefit cats by decreasing the stress levels and increasing the quality of care in veterinary clinical settings. They found that tranquil behaviors can be achieved in a veterinary clinical setting with the introduction of cat-specific music.

=== Cows ===
In an unpublished study at the University of Leicester, Liam MacKenzie and Adrian North found that playing music for dairy cows had an effect on the amount of milk that they produced. Over a nine-week period, dairy cows were exposed to fast (&gt; 120 BPM), slow (&lt; 100 BPM), and no music. Music was played for the cows 12 hours a day from 5 AM to 5 PM. The study found that cows exposed to slow music, like R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; or Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot;, produced 3% more milk than cows that were exposed to fast music, like &quot;Pumping on your Stereo&quot; by Supergrass and &quot;Size of a Cow&quot; by Wonderstuff. Bovine milk production has long been thought to be affected by exposure to music. Some farmers expose their cows to music to aid in milk production.

=== Dogs ===
Decreased stress levels have been observed in kennelled dogs that were exposed to classical music, but rapid habituation was also observed. In a 2017 follow up study, kennelled dogs were exposed to five different genres of music including soft rock, Motown, pop, reggae, and classical in order to determine whether or not increased variety of music could reduce habituation. The study found the heart rate variability, which indicates a decreased stress level, was significantly higher when the dogs were played reggae and soft rock, but the other three genres had a similar but less pronounced effect. In addition, the dogs were much more likely to lie down rather than stand while the music was being played. The study suggested that the increased variety of music decreased habituation that was present when playing exclusively classical music, though the dogs responded best when exposed to reggae and soft rock.

<text>Down on the Farm is the seventh studio album by the American rock band Little Feat. The album was completed and released shortly after the death of the band&#x27;s founder and frontman, Lowell George, in 1979. It was their last original work for nine years. The band had announced their break-up in June 1979 during the making of the album. Little Feat would reform in 1987.

The cover shows one of Neon Park&#x27;s several &quot;duck-girls&quot;—an allusion to &quot;The Finishing Touch&quot; by painter Gil Elvgren.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s very much an album of songs, with none of the longish solos and other experiments that often seemed out of place on Little Feat albums in the past.&quot;
