<text>Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development, or his genetic epistemology, is a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human intelligence. It was originated by the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980). The theory deals with the nature of knowledge itself and how humans gradually come to acquire, construct, and use it. Piaget&#x27;s theory is mainly known as a developmental stage theory.

In 1919, while working at the Alfred Binet Laboratory School in Paris, Piaget &quot;was intrigued by the fact that children of different ages made different kinds of mistakes while solving problems&quot;. His experience and observations at the Alfred Binet Laboratory were the beginnings of his theory of cognitive development.

He believed that children of different ages made different mistakes because of the &quot;quality rather than quantity&quot; of their intelligence. Piaget proposed four stages to describe the development process of children: sensorimotor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage, and formal operational stage. Each stage describes a specific age group. In each stage, he described how children develop their cognitive skills. For example, he believed that children experience the world through actions, representing things with words, thinking logically, and using reasoning.

To Piaget, cognitive development was a progressive reorganisation of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. He believed that children construct an understanding of the world around them, experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment, then adjust their ideas accordingly. Moreover, Piaget claimed that cognitive development is at the centre of the human organism, and language is contingent on knowledge and understanding acquired through cognitive development. Piaget&#x27;s earlier work received the greatest attention.

Child-centred classrooms and &quot;open education&quot; are direct applications of Piaget&#x27;s views. Despite its huge success, Piaget&#x27;s theory has some limitations that Piaget recognised himself: for example, the theory supports sharp stages rather than continuous development (horizontal and vertical décalage).

==Nature of intelligence: operative and figurative==
Piaget argued that reality is a construction. Reality is defined in reference to the two conditions that define dynamic systems. Specifically, he argued that reality involves transformations and states. &quot;Transformations&quot; refer to all manners of changes that a thing or person can undergo. &quot;States&quot; refer to the conditions or the appearances in which things or persons can be found between transformations. For example, there might be changes in shape or form (for instance, liquids are reshaped as they are transferred from one vessel to another, and similarly humans change in their characteristics as they grow older), in size (a toddler does not walk and run without falling, but after 7 yrs of age, the child&#x27;s sensorimotor anatomy is well developed and now acquires skill faster), or in placement or location in space and time (e.g., various objects or persons might be found at one place at one time and at a different place at another time). Thus, Piaget argued, if human intelligence is to be adaptive, it must have functions to represent both the transformational and the static aspects of reality. He proposed that operative intelligence is responsible for the representation and manipulation of the dynamic or transformational aspects of reality, and that figurative intelligence is responsible for the representation of the static aspects of reality.

&quot;Operative intelligence&quot; is the active aspect of intelligence. It involves all actions, overt or covert, undertaken in order to follow, recover, or anticipate the transformations of the objects or persons of interest. &quot;Figurative intelligence&quot; is the more or less static aspect of intelligence, involving all means of representation used to retain in mind the states (i.e., successive forms, shapes, or locations) that intervene between transformations. That is, it involves perception, imitation, mental imagery, drawing, and language. Therefore, the figurative aspects of intelligence derive their meaning from the operative aspects of intelligence, because states cannot exist independently of the transformations that interconnect them. Piaget stated that the figurative or the representational aspects of intelligence are subservient to its operative and dynamic aspects, and therefore, that understanding essentially derives from the operative aspect of intelligence.

At any time, operative intelligence frames how the world is understood and it changes if understanding is not successful. Piaget stated that this process of understanding and change involves two basic functions: &quot;assimilation&quot; and &quot;accommodation&quot;.

===Assimilation and accommodation===
Through his study of the field of education, Piaget focused on two processes, which he named assimilation and accommodation. To Piaget, assimilation meant integrating external elements into structures of lives or environments, or those we could have through experience. &quot;Assimilation&quot; is how humans perceive and adapt to new information. It is the process of fitting new information into pre-existing cognitive schemas. Assimilation in which new experiences are reinterpreted to fit into, or assimilate with, old ideas and analyzing new facts accordingly. It occurs when humans are faced with new or unfamiliar information and refer to previously learned information in order to make sense of it. In contrast, &quot;accommodation&quot; is the process of taking new information in one&#x27;s environment and altering pre-existing schemas in order to fit in the new information. This happens when the existing schema (knowledge) does not work, and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation. Accommodation is imperative because it is how people will continue to interpret new concepts, schemas, frameworks, and more. 

Various teaching methods have been developed based on Piaget&#x27;s insights that call for the use of questioning and inquiry-based education to help learners more blatantly face the sorts of contradictions to their pre-existing schemas that are conducive to learning.

Piaget believed that the human brain has been programmed through evolution to bring equilibrium, which is what he believed ultimately influences structures by the internal and external processes through assimilation and accommodation.

Piaget&#x27;s understanding was that assimilation and accommodation cannot exist without the other. They are two sides of a coin. To assimilate an object into an existing mental schema, one first needs to take into account or accommodate to the particularities of this object to a certain extent. For instance, to recognize (assimilate) an apple as an apple, one must first focus (accommodate) on the contour of this object. To do this, one needs to roughly recognize the size of the object. Development increases the balance, or equilibration, between these two functions. When in balance with each other, assimilation and accommodation generate mental schemas of the operative intelligence. When one function dominates over the other, they generate representations which belong to figurative intelligence.

===Cognitive equilibration===
Piaget agreed with most other developmental psychologists in that there are three very important factors that are attributed to development: maturation, experience, and the social environment. But where his theory differs involves his addition of a fourth factor, equilibration, which &quot;refers to the organism&#x27;s attempt to keep its cognitive schemes in balance&quot;.

. Also see Piaget, and Boom&#x27;s detailed account.

Equilibration is the motivational element that guides cognitive development. As humans, we have a biological need to make sense of the things we encounter in every aspect of our world in order to muster a greater understanding of it, and therefore, to flourish in it. This is where the concept of equilibration comes into play. If a child is confronted with information that does not fit into his or her previously held schemes, disequilibrium is said to occur. This, as one would imagine, is unsatisfactory to the child, so he or she will try to fix it. The incongruence will be fixed in one of three ways. The child will either ignore the newly discovered information, assimilate the information into a preexisting scheme, or accommodate the information by modifying a different scheme. Using any of these methods will return the child to a state of equilibrium, however, depending on the information being presented to the child, that state of equilibrium is not likely to be permanent.

For example, let&#x27;s say Dave, a three-year-old boy who has grown up on a farm and is accustomed to seeing Horses regularly, has been brought to the zoo by his parents and sees an Elephant for the first time. Immediately he shouts &quot;look mommy, Horsey!&quot; Because Dave does not have a scheme for Elephants, he interprets the Elephant as being a Horse due to its large size, color, tail, and long face. He believes the Elephant is a Horse until his mother corrects. The new information Dave has received has put him in a state of disequilibrium. He now has to do one of three things. He can either: (1) turn his head, move towards another section of animals, and ignore this newly presented information; (2) distort the defining characteristics of an Elephant so that he can assimilate it into his &quot;Horsey&quot; scheme; or (3) he can modify his preexisting &quot;Animal&quot; schema to accommodate this new information regarding Elephants by slightly altering his knowledge of animals as he knows them.

With age comes entry into a higher stage of development. With that being said, previously held schemes (and the children that hold them) are more than likely to be confronted with discrepant information the older they get. Silverman and Geiringer propose that one would be more successful in attempting to change a child&#x27;s mode of thought by exposing that child to concepts that reflect a higher rather than a lower stage of development. Furthermore, children are better influenced by modeled performances that are one stage above their developmental level, as opposed to modeled performances that are either lower or two or more stages above their level.


==Four stages of development==
In his theory of cognitive development, Jean Piaget proposed that humans progress through four developmental stages: the &quot;sensorimotor&quot; stage, &quot;preoperational&quot; stage, &quot;concrete operational&quot; stage, and &quot;formal operational&quot; stage.

===Sensorimotor stage===

The first of these, the sensorimotor stage &quot;extends from birth to the acquisition of language&quot;. In this stage, infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences (such as vision and hearing) from physical interactions with objects (such as grasping, sucking, and stepping). Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it. They progress from reflexive, instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought toward the end of the stage.

Children learn that they are separate from the environment. They can think about aspects of the environment, even though these may be outside the reach of the child&#x27;s senses. In this stage, according to Piaget, the development of &quot;object permanence&quot; is one of the most important accomplishments. Object permanence is a child&#x27;s understanding that an object continues to exist even though they cannot see or hear it. Peek-a-boo is a game in which children who have yet to fully develop object permanence respond to sudden hiding and revealing of a face. By the end of the sensorimotor period, children develop a permanent sense of self and object and will quickly lose interest in Peek-a-boo.

Piaget divided the sensorimotor stage into six sub-stages.

===Preoperational stage===
By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate the second stage of his theory, the pre-operational stage. He said that this stage starts towards the end of the second year. It starts when the child begins to learn to speak and lasts up until the age of seven. During the pre-operational stage of cognitive development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information. Children&#x27;s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children&#x27;s play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved.

The pre-operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs (magical thinking). The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into &quot;two&quot; substages: the symbolic function substage, and the intuitive thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;how come?&quot; This stage is when children want to understand everything.

====Symbolic function substage====
At about two to four years of age, children cannot yet manipulate and transform information in a logical way. However, they now can think in images and symbols. Other examples of mental abilities are language and pretend play. Symbolic play is when children develop imaginary friends or role-play with friends. Children&#x27;s play becomes more social and they assign roles to each other. Some examples of symbolic play include playing house, or having a tea party. The type of symbolic play in which children engage is connected with their level of creativity and ability to connect with others. Additionally, the quality of their symbolic play can have consequences on their later development. For example, young children whose symbolic play is of a violent nature tend to exhibit less prosocial behavior and are more likely to display antisocial tendencies in later years.

In this stage, there are still limitations, such as egocentrism and precausal thinking.

Egocentrism occurs when a child is unable to distinguish between their own perspective and that of another person. Children tend to stick to their own viewpoint, rather than consider the view of others. Indeed, they are not even aware that such a concept as &quot;different viewpoints&quot; exists. Egocentrism can be seen in an experiment performed by Piaget and Swiss developmental psychologist Bärbel Inhelder, known as the three mountain problem. In this experiment, three views of a mountain are shown to the child, who is asked what a traveling doll would see at the various angles. The child will consistently describe what they can see from the position from which they are seated, regardless of the angle from which they are asked to take the doll&#x27;s perspective. Egocentrism would also cause a child to believe, &quot;I like &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;, so the high school student next door must like &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;, too.&quot;

Similar to preoperational children&#x27;s egocentric thinking is their structuring of a cause and effect relationships. Piaget coined the term &quot;precausal thinking&quot; to describe the way in which preoperational children use their own existing ideas or views, like in egocentrism, to explain cause-and-effect relationships. Three main concepts of causality as displayed by children in the preoperational stage include: animism, artificialism and transductive reasoning.

Animism is the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities. An example could be a child believing that the sidewalk was mad and made them fall down, or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy. Artificialism refers to the belief that environmental characteristics can be attributed to human actions or interventions. For example, a child might say that it is windy outside because someone is blowing very hard, or the clouds are white because someone painted them that color. Finally, precausal thinking is categorized by transductive reasoning. Transductive reasoning is when a child fails to understand the true relationships between cause and effect. Unlike deductive or inductive reasoning (general to specific, or specific to general), transductive reasoning refers to when a child reasons from specific to specific, drawing a relationship between two separate events that are otherwise unrelated. For example, if a child hears the dog bark and then a balloon popped, the child would conclude that because the dog barked, the balloon popped.

====Intuitive thought substage====
A main feature of the pre-operational stage of development is primitive reasoning. Between the ages of four and seven, reasoning changes from symbolic thought to intuitive thought. This stage is &quot;marked by greater dependence on intuitive thinking rather than just perception.&quot; Children begin to have more automatic thoughts that don&#x27;t require evidence. During this stage there is a heightened sense of curiosity and need to understand how and why things work. Piaget named this substage &quot;intuitive thought&quot; because they are starting to develop more logical thought but cannot explain their reasoning. Thought during this stage is still immature and cognitive errors occur. Children in this stage depend on their own subjective perception of the object or event. This stage is characterized by centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference.

Centration is the act of focusing all attention on one characteristic or dimension of a situation, whilst disregarding all others. Conservation is the awareness that altering a substance&#x27;s appearance does not change its basic properties. Children at this stage are unaware of conservation and exhibit centration. Both centration and conservation can be more easily understood once familiarized with Piaget&#x27;s most famous experimental task.

In this task, a child is presented with two identical beakers containing the same amount of liquid. The child usually notes that the beakers do contain the same amount of liquid. When one of the beakers is poured into a taller and thinner container, children who are younger than seven or eight years old typically say that the two beakers no longer contain the same amount of liquid, and that the taller container holds the larger quantity (centration), without taking into consideration the fact that both beakers were previously noted to contain the same amount of liquid. Due to superficial changes, the child was unable to comprehend that the properties of the substances continued to remain the same (conservation).

Irreversibility is a concept developed in this stage which is closely related to the ideas of centration and conservation. Irreversibility refers to when children are unable to mentally reverse a sequence of events. In the same beaker situation, the child does not realize that, if the sequence of events was reversed and the water from the tall beaker was poured back into its original beaker, then the same amount of water would exist. Another example of children&#x27;s reliance on visual representations is their misunderstanding of &quot;less than&quot; or &quot;more than&quot;. When two rows containing equal numbers of blocks are placed in front of a child, one row spread farther apart than the other, the child will think that the row spread farther contains more blocks.

Class inclusion refers to a kind of conceptual thinking that children in the preoperational stage cannot yet grasp. Children&#x27;s inability to focus on two aspects of a situation at once inhibits them from understanding the principle that one category or class can contain several different subcategories or classes. For example, a four-year-old girl may be shown a picture of eight dogs and three cats. The girl knows what cats and dogs are, and she is aware that they are both animals. However, when asked, &quot;Are there more dogs or animals?&quot; she is likely to answer &quot;more dogs&quot;. This is due to her difficulty focusing on the two subclasses and the larger class all at the same time. She may have been able to view the dogs as dogs &quot;or&quot; animals, but struggled when trying to classify them as both, simultaneously. Similar to this is concept relating to intuitive thought, known as &quot;transitive inference&quot;.

Transitive inference is using previous knowledge to determine the missing piece, using basic logic. Children in the preoperational stage lack this logic. An example of transitive inference would be when a child is presented with the information &quot;A&quot; is greater than &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is greater than &quot;C&quot;. This child may have difficulty here understanding that &quot;A&quot; is also greater than &quot;C&quot;.

===Concrete operational stage===
The concrete operational stage is the third stage of Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development. This stage, which follows the preoperational stage, occurs between the ages of 7 and 11 (middle childhood and preadolescence) years, and is characterized by the appropriate use of logic. During this stage, a child&#x27;s thought processes become more mature and &quot;adult like&quot;. They start solving problems in a more logical fashion. Abstract, hypothetical thinking is not yet developed in the child, and children can only solve problems that apply to concrete events or objects. At this stage, the children undergo a transition where the child learns rules such as conservation. Piaget determined that children are able to incorporate inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences from observations in order to make a generalization. In contrast, children struggle with deductive reasoning, which involves using a generalized principle in order to try to predict the outcome of an event. Children in this stage commonly experience difficulties with figuring out logic in their heads. For example, a child will understand that &quot;A is more than B&quot; and &quot;B is more than C&quot;. However, when asked &quot;is A more than C?&quot;, the child might not be able to logically figure the question out mentally.

Two other important processes in the concrete operational stage are logic and the elimination of egocentrism.

Egocentrism is the inability to consider or understand a perspective other than one&#x27;s own. It is the phase where the thought and morality of the child is completely self focused. During this stage, the child acquires the ability to view things from another individual&#x27;s perspective, even if they think that perspective is incorrect. For instance, show a child a comic in which Jane puts a doll under a box, leaves the room, and then Melissa moves the doll to a drawer, and Jane comes back. A child in the concrete operations stage will say that Jane will still think it&#x27;s under the box even though the child knows it is in the drawer. (See also False-belief task.)

Children in this stage can, however, only solve problems that apply to actual (concrete) objects or events, and not abstract concepts or hypothetical tasks. Understanding and knowing how to use full common sense has not yet been completely adapted.

Piaget determined that children in the concrete operational stage were able to incorporate inductive logic. On the other hand, children at this age have difficulty using deductive logic, which involves using a general principle to predict the outcome of a specific event. This includes mental reversibility. An example of this is being able to reverse the order of relationships between mental categories. For example, a child might be able to recognize that his or her dog is a Labrador, that a Labrador is a dog, and that a dog is an animal, and draw conclusions from the information available, as well as apply all these processes to hypothetical situations.

The abstract quality of the adolescent&#x27;s thought at the formal operational level is evident in the adolescent&#x27;s verbal problem solving ability. The logical quality of the adolescent&#x27;s thought is when children are more likely to solve problems in a trial-and-error fashion. Adolescents begin to think more as a scientist thinks, devising plans to solve problems and systematically test opinions. They use hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which means that they develop hypotheses or best guesses, and systematically deduce, or conclude, which is the best path to follow in solving the problem. During this stage the adolescent is able to understand love, logical proofs and values. During this stage the young person begins to entertain possibilities for the future and is fascinated with what they can be.

Adolescents also are changing cognitively by the way that they think about social matters. One thing that brings about a change is egocentrism. This happens by heightening self-consciousness and giving adolescents an idea of who they are through their personal uniqueness and invincibility. Adolescent egocentrism can be dissected into two types of social thinking: imaginary audience and personal fable. Imaginary audience consists of an adolescent believing that others are watching them and the things they do. Personal fable is not the same thing as imaginary audience but is often confused with imaginary audience. Personal fable consists of believing that you are exceptional in some way. These types of social thinking begin in the concrete stage but carry on to the formal operational stage of development.

====Testing for concrete operations====
Piagetian tests are well known and practiced to test for concrete operations. The most prevalent tests are those for conservation. There are some important aspects that the experimenter must take into account when performing experiments with these children.

One example of an experiment for testing conservation is the water level task. An experimenter will have two glasses that are the same size, fill them to the same level with liquid, and make sure the child understands that both of the glasses have the same amount of water in them. Then, the experimenter will pour the liquid from one of the small glasses into a tall, thin glass. The experimenter will then ask the child if the taller glass has more liquid, less liquid, or the same amount of liquid. The child will then give his answer. There are three keys for the experimenter to keep in mind with this experiment. These are justification, number of times asking, and word choice.
* &quot;Justification&quot;: After the child has answered the question being posed, the experimenter must ask why the child gave that answer. This is important because the answers they give can help the experimenter to assess the child&#x27;s developmental age.
* &quot;Number of times asking&quot;: Some argue that a child&#x27;s answers can be influenced by the number of times an experimenter asks them about the amount of water in the glasses. For example, a child is asked about the amount of liquid in the first set of glasses and then asked once again after the water is moved into a different sized glass. Some children will doubt their original answer and say something they would not have said if they did not doubt their first answer.
* &quot;Word choice&quot;: The phrasing that the experimenter uses may affect how the child answers. If, in the liquid and glass example, the experimenter asks, &quot;Which of these glasses has more liquid?&quot;, the child may think that his thoughts of them being the same is wrong because the adult is saying that one must have more. Alternatively, if the experimenter asks, &quot;Are these equal?&quot;, then the child is more likely to say that they are, because the experimenter is implying that they are.
* &quot;Classification&quot;: As children&#x27;s experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schemata and are able to organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses. 
* &quot;Identity&quot;: One feature of concrete operational thought is the understanding that objects have qualities that do not change even if the object is altered in some way. For instance, mass of an object does not change by rearranging it. A piece of chalk is still chalk even when the piece is broken in two. 
* &quot;Reversibility&quot;: The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to their original state. Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again; however, eggs cannot be unscrambled. Children use reversibility a lot in mathematical problems such as: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 – 3 = 2.
* &quot;Conservation&quot;: The ability to understand that the quantity (mass, weight volume) of something doesn&#x27;t change due to the change of appearance.
* &quot;Decentration&quot;: The ability to focus on more than one feature of scenario or problem at a time. This also describes the ability to attend to more than one task at a time. Decentration is what allows for conservation to occur.
* &quot;Seriation&quot;: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can logically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length. Younger children not yet in the concrete stage approach a similar task in a haphazard way.

These new cognitive skills increase the child&#x27;s understanding of the physical world. However, according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in systematic scientific ways. For example, most children under age twelve would not be able to come up with the variables that influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc. Even if they were given weights they could attach to strings in order to do this experiment, they would not be able to draw a clear conclusion.

===Formal operational stage===

The final stage is known as the formal operational stage (early to middle adolescence, beginning at age 11 and finalizing around 14–15): Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts. This form of thought includes &quot;assumptions that have no necessary relation to reality.&quot; At this point, the person is capable of hypothetical and deductive reasoning. During this time, people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts.

Piaget stated that &quot;hypothetico-deductive reasoning&quot; becomes important during the formal operational stage. This type of thinking involves hypothetical &quot;what-if&quot; situations that are not always rooted in reality, i.e. counterfactual thinking. It is often required in science and mathematics.

* Abstract thought emerges during the formal operational stage. Children tend to think very concretely and specifically in earlier stages, and begin to consider possible outcomes and consequences of actions.
* Metacognition, the capacity for &quot;thinking about thinking&quot; that allows adolescents and adults to reason about their thought processes and monitor them.
* Problem-solving is demonstrated when children use trial-and-error to solve problems. The ability to systematically solve a problem in a logical and methodical way emerges.
Children in primary school years mostly use inductive reasoning, but adolescents start to use deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is when children draw general conclusions from personal experiences and specific facts. Adolescents learn how to use deductive reasoning by applying logic to create specific conclusions from abstract concepts. This capability results from their capacity to think hypothetically.

&quot;However, research has shown that not all persons in all cultures reach formal operations, and most people do not use formal operations in all aspects of their lives&quot;.

====Experiments====
Piaget and his colleagues conducted several experiments to assess formal operational thought.

In one of the experiments, Piaget evaluated the cognitive capabilities of children of different ages through the use of a scale and varying weights. The task was to balance the scale by hooking weights on the ends of the scale. To successfully complete the task, the children must use formal operational thought to realize that the distance of the weights from the center and the heaviness of the weights both affected the balance. A heavier weight has to be placed closer to the center of the scale, and a lighter weight has to be placed farther from the center, so that the two weights balance each other. While 3- to 5- year olds could not at all comprehend the concept of balancing, children by the age of 7 could balance the scale by placing the same weights on both ends, but they failed to realize the importance of the location. By age 10, children could think about location but failed to use logic and instead used trial-and-error. Finally, by age 13 and 14, in early to middle adolescence, some children more clearly understood the relationship between weight and distance and could successfully implement their hypothesis.

===The stages and causation===
Piaget sees children&#x27;s conception of causation as a march from &quot;primitive&quot; conceptions of cause to those of a more scientific, rigorous, and mechanical nature. These primitive concepts are characterized as supernatural, with a decidedly non-natural or non-mechanical tone. Piaget has as his most basic assumption that babies are phenomenists. That is, their knowledge &quot;consists of assimilating things to schemas&quot; from their own action such that they appear, from the child&#x27;s point of view, &quot;to have qualities which, in fact, stem from the organism&quot;. Consequently, these &quot;subjective conceptions,&quot; so prevalent during Piaget&#x27;s first stage of development, are dashed upon discovering deeper empirical truths.

Piaget gives the example of a child believing that the moon and stars follow him on a night walk. Upon learning that such is the case for his friends, he must separate his self from the object, resulting in a theory that the moon is immobile, or moves independently of other agents.

The second stage, from around three to eight years of age, is characterized by a mix of this type of magical, animistic, or &quot;non-natural&quot; conceptions of causation and mechanical or &quot;naturalistic&quot; causation. This conjunction of natural and non-natural causal explanations supposedly stems from experience itself, though Piaget does not make much of an attempt to describe the nature of the differences in conception. In his interviews with children, he asked questions specifically about natural phenomena, such as: &quot;What makes clouds move?&quot;, &quot;What makes the stars move?&quot;, &quot;Why do rivers flow?&quot; The nature of all the answers given, Piaget says, are such that these objects must perform their actions to &quot;fulfill their obligations towards men&quot;. He calls this &quot;moral explanation&quot;.

==Postulated physical mechanisms underlying schemes, schemas, and stages==
First note the distinction between &#x27;schemes&#x27; (analogous to 1D lists of action-instructions, e.g. leading to separate pen-strokes), and figurative &#x27;schemas&#x27; (aka &#x27;schemata&#x27;, akin to 2D drawings/sketches or virtual 3D models); see schema. This distinction (often overlooked by translators) is emphasized by Piaget &amp; Inhelder, and others + (Appendix p. 21-22).

In 1967, Piaget considered the possibility of RNA molecules as likely embodiments of his still-abstract schemes (which he promoted as units of action) — though he did not come to any firm conclusion. At that time, due to work such as that of Swedish biochemist Holger Hydén, RNA concentrations had, indeed, been shown to correlate with learning.

To date, with one exception, it has been impossible to investigate such RNA hypotheses by traditional direct observation and logical deduction. The one exception is that such ultra-micro sites would almost certainly have to use optical communication, and recently studies have demonstrated that nerve-fibres can indeed transmit light/infra-red (in addition to their acknowledged role). However it accords with the philosophy of science, especially scientific realism, to do &quot;indirect&quot; investigations of such phenomena which are intrinsically unobservable for practical reasons. The art then is to build up a plausible interdisciplinary case from the indirect evidence (as indeed the child does during concept development) — and then retain that model until it is disproved by observable-or-other new evidence which then calls for new accommodation.

In that spirit, it now might be said that the RNA/infra-red model &quot;is&quot; valid (for explaining Piagetian higher intelligence). Anyhow the current situation opens the way for more testing, and further development in several directions, including the finer points of Piaget&#x27;s agenda.

==Practical applications==
Parents can use Piaget&#x27;s theory in many ways to support their child&#x27;s growth. Teachers can also use Piaget&#x27;s theory to help their students. For example, recent studies have shown that children in the same grade and of the same age perform differently on tasks measuring basic addition and subtraction accuracy. Children in the preoperational and concrete operational levels of cognitive development perform arithmetic operations (such as addition and subtraction) with similar accuracy; however, children in the concrete operational level have been able to perform both addition problems and subtraction problems with overall greater precision. Teachers can use Piaget&#x27;s theory to see where each child in their class stands with each subject by discussing the syllabus with their students and the students&#x27; parents.

The stage of cognitive growth of a person differ from another. Cognitive development or thinking is an active process from the beginning to the end of life. Intellectual advancement happens because people at every age and developmental period look for cognitive equilibrium. To achieve this balance, the easiest way is to understand the new experiences through the lens of the preexisting ideas. Infants learn that new objects can be grabbed in the same way of familiar objects, and adults explain the day&#x27;s headlines as evidence for their existing worldview.

However, the application of standardized Piagetian theory and procedures in different societies established widely varying results that lead some to speculate not only that some cultures produce more cognitive development than others but that without specific kinds of cultural experience, but also formal schooling, development might cease at certain level, such as concrete operational level. A procedure was done following methods developed in Geneva (i.e. water level task). Participants were presented with two beakers of equal circumference and height, filled with equal amounts of water. The water from one beaker was transferred into another with taller and smaller circumference. The children and young adults from non-literate societies of a given age were more likely to think that the taller, thinner beaker had more water in it. On the other hand, an experiment on the effects of modifying testing procedures to match local cultural produced a different pattern of results. In the revised procedures, the participants explained in their own language and indicated that while the water was now &quot;more&quot;, the quantity was the same. Piaget&#x27;s water level task has also been applied to the elderly by Formann and results showed an age-associated non-linear decline of performance.

==Relation to psychometric theories of intelligence==

Researchers have linked Piaget&#x27;s theory to Cattell and Horn&#x27;s theory of fluid and crystallized abilities. Piaget&#x27;s operative intelligence corresponds to the Cattell-Horn formulation of fluid ability in that both concern logical thinking and the &quot;eduction of relations&quot; (an expression Cattell used to refer to the inferring of relationships). Piaget&#x27;s treatment of everyday learning corresponds to the Cattell-Horn formulation of crystallized ability in that both reflect the impress of experience. Piaget&#x27;s operativity is considered to be prior to, and ultimately provides the foundation for, everyday learning, much like fluid ability&#x27;s relation to crystallized intelligence.

Piaget&#x27;s theory also aligns with another psychometric theory, namely the psychometric theory of &quot;g&quot;, general intelligence. Piaget designed a number of tasks to assess hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests. Notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. &quot;g&quot; is thought to underlie performance on the two types of tasks. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of &quot;g&quot; as standard IQ tests.

==Challenges to Piagetian stage theory==
Piagetian accounts of development have been challenged on several grounds. First, as Piaget himself noted, development does not always progress in the smooth manner his theory seems to predict. &quot;Décalage&quot;, or progressive forms of cognitive developmental progression in a specific domain, suggest that the stage model is, at best, a useful approximation. Furthermore, studies have found that children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease (Lourenço &amp; Machado, 1996, p. 145). More broadly, Piaget&#x27;s theory is &quot;domain general,&quot; predicting that cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains of knowledge (such as mathematics, logic, and understanding of physics or language). Piaget did not take into account variability in a child&#x27;s performance notably how a child can differ in sophistication across several domains.

During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive developmentalists were influenced by &quot;neo-nativist&quot; and evolutionary psychology ideas. These ideas de-emphasized domain general theories and emphasized domain specificity or modularity of mind. Modularity implies that different cognitive faculties may be largely independent of one another, and thus develop according to quite different timetables, which are &quot;influenced by real world experiences&quot;. In this vein, some cognitive developmentalists argued that, rather than being domain general learners, children come equipped with domain specific theories, sometimes referred to as &quot;core knowledge,&quot; which allows them to break into learning within that domain. For example, even young infants appear to be sensitive to some predictable regularities in the movement and interactions of objects (for example, an object cannot pass through another object), or in human behavior (for example, a hand repeatedly reaching for an object has that object, not just a particular path of motion), as it becomes the building block of which more elaborate knowledge is constructed.

Piaget&#x27;s theory has been said to undervalue the influence that culture has on cognitive development. Piaget demonstrates that a child goes through several stages of cognitive development and come to conclusions on their own, however, a child&#x27;s sociocultural environment plays an important part in their cognitive development. Social interaction teaches the child about the world and helps them develop through the cognitive stages, which Piaget neglected to consider.

More recent work from a newer dynamic systems approach has strongly challenged some of the basic presumptions of the &quot;core knowledge&quot; school that Piaget suggested. Dynamic systems approaches harken to modern neuroscientific research that was not available to Piaget when he was constructing his theory. This brought new light into research in psychology in which new techniques such as brain imaging provided new understanding to cognitive development. One important finding is that domain-specific knowledge is constructed as children develop and integrate knowledge. This enables the domain to improve the accuracy of the knowledge as well as organization of memories. However, this suggests more of a &quot;smooth integration&quot; of learning and development than either Piaget, or his neo-nativist critics, had envisioned. Additionally, some psychologists, such as Lev Vygotsky and Jerome Bruner, thought differently from Piaget, suggesting that language was more important for cognition development than Piaget implied.

==Post-Piagetian and neo-Piagetian stages==

In recent years, several theorists attempted to address concerns with Piaget&#x27;s theory by developing new theories and models that can accommodate evidence which violates Piagetian predictions and postulates.

* The neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, advanced by Robbie Case, Andreas Demetriou, Graeme S. Halford, Kurt W. Fischer, Michael Lamport Commons, and Juan Pascual-Leone, attempted to integrate Piaget&#x27;s theory with cognitive and differential theories of cognitive organization and development. Their aim was to better account for the cognitive factors of development and for intra-individual and inter-individual differences in cognitive development. They suggested that development along Piaget&#x27;s stages is due to increasing working memory capacity and processing efficiency by &quot;biological maturation&quot;. Moreover, Demetriou&#x27;s theory ascribes an important role to hypercognitive processes of &quot;self-monitoring, self-recording, self-evaluation, and self-regulation&quot;, and it recognizes the operation of several relatively autonomous domains of thought (Demetriou, 1998; Demetriou, Mouyi, Spanoudis, 2010; Demetriou, 2003, p. 153).
* Piaget&#x27;s theory stops at the formal operational stage, but other researchers have observed the thinking of adults is more nuanced than formal operational thought. This fifth stage has been named post formal thought or operation. Post formal stages have been proposed. Michael Commons presented evidence for four post formal stages in the model of hierarchical complexity: systematic, meta-systematic, paradigmatic, and cross-paradigmatic (Commons &amp; Richards, 2003, p. 206–208; Oliver, 2004, p. 31). There are many theorists, however, who have criticized &quot;post formal thinking,&quot; because the concept lacks both theoretical and empirical verification. The term &quot;integrative thinking&quot; has been suggested for use instead.

* A &quot;sentential&quot; stage, said to occur before the early preoperational stage, has been proposed by Fischer, Biggs and Biggs, Commons, and Richards.
* Jerome Bruner has expressed views on cognitive development in a &quot;pragmatic orientation&quot; in which humans actively use knowledge for practical applications, such as problem solving and understanding reality.
* Michael Lamport Commons proposed the model of hierarchical complexity (MHC) in two dimensions: horizontal complexity and vertical complexity (Commons &amp; Richards, 2003, p. 205).
* Kieran Egan has proposed five stages of understanding. These are &quot;somatic&quot;, &quot;mythic&quot;, &quot;romantic&quot;, &quot;philosophic&quot;, and &quot;ironic&quot;. These stages are developed through cognitive tools such as &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;binary oppositions&quot;, &quot;fantasy&quot; and &quot;rhyme, rhythm, and meter&quot; to enhance memorization to develop a long-lasting learning capacity.
* Lawrence Kohlberg developed three stages of moral development: &quot;Preconventional&quot;, &quot;Conventional&quot; and &quot;Postconventional&quot;. Each level is composed of two orientation stages, with a total of six orientation stages: (1) &quot;Punishment-Obedience&quot;, (2) &quot;Instrumental Relativist&quot;, (3) &quot;Good Boy-Nice Girl&quot;, (4) &quot;Law and Order&quot;, (5) &quot;Social Contract&quot;, and (6) &quot;Universal Ethical Principle&quot;.
* Andreas Demetriou has expressed neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.
* Jane Loevinger&#x27;s stages of ego development occur through &quot;an evolution of stages&quot;. &quot;First is the Presocial Stage followed by the Symbiotic Stage, Impulsive Stage, Self-Protective Stage, Conformist Stage, Self-Aware Level: Transition from Conformist to Conscientious Stage, Individualistic Level: Transition from Conscientious to the Autonomous Stage, Conformist Stage, and Integrated Stage&quot;.
* Ken Wilber has incorporated Piaget&#x27;s theory in his multidisciplinary field of integral theory. The human consciousness is structured in hierarchical order and organized in &quot;holon&quot; chains or &quot;great chain of being&quot;, which are based on the level of spiritual and psychological development.
* Oliver Kress published a model that connected Piaget&#x27;s theory of development and Abraham Maslow&#x27;s concept of self-actualization. 
* Cheryl Armon has proposed five stages of &quot; the Good Life&quot;. These are &quot;Egoistic Hedonism&quot;, &quot;Instrumental Hedonism&quot;, &quot;Affective/Altruistic Mutuality&quot;, &quot;Individuality&quot;, and &quot;Autonomy/Community&quot; (Andreoletti &amp; Demick, 2003, p. 284) (Armon, 1984, p. 40–43).
* Christopher R. Hallpike proposed that human evolution of cognitive moral understanding had evolved from the beginning of time from its primitive state to the present time.
* Robert Kegan extended Piaget&#x27;s developmental model to adults in describing what he called constructive-developmental psychology.

<text>The signalling system used on the rail transport in Norway is regulated by the &quot;Regulations of December 4, 2001 no. 1336 about signals and signs on the state&#x27;s railway network and connected private tracks&quot;.

The first signalling system on the Norwegian railway system was a mechanically operated semaphore system introduced at Drammen station in 1893. The first electrically operated light signal system was delivered by AEG in 1924. Today, only electrically operated light signals are used.

==Train radio==
Between 1993 and 1996, NSB rolled out the analog train radio system Scanet. Developed by Ascom Radiocom, it was only installed on the primary railway lines. The system allows radio communication between a train dispatcher, and train drivers and other users involved in railway operations. Scanet was also connected to the automatic train control system. However, several lines lack the system, including the Arendal Line, the Flåm Line, the Meråker Line, the Nordland Line, the Rauma Line, the Røros Line, the Inner Østfold Line, the northern part of the Gjøvik Line, and several tunnels along the Bergen Line and the Sørland Line. The Åsta accident in 2000 spurred the need to give all parts of the railway coverage with train radio. On these lines, the dispatcher and drivers had to communicate using the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT 450) standard, a system which the operator Telenor discontinued in 2002.

Scanet was replaced by Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) between 2004 2007, with the systems first being installed on the lines without Scanet. The system, delivered by Nokia Siemens Networks, was on time and on budget, and made Norway one of the first countries to fully implement the system throughout Europe. After GSM-R was fully implemented on 1 November, Scanet was gradually closed. The new system has been characterized as simpler to use and giving better audio quality than Scanet. The implementation cost 1.8 billion Norwegian krone and covers the entire network.

== Means of signalling ==
The following means of signalling are used:

* Signal flags
* Hand-held signal lamps
* Signal whistle
* Arm signals
* Fixed light signals
* Fixed sound signals
* Signal signs
* Orientation posts
* Locomotive whistle
* Locomotive and train signal lamps

== The fundamental meaning of the signal colors ==
* Red always indicates &quot;stop&quot;.
* Violet indicates that the associated level crossing signal is showing &quot;Stop short of the level crossing&quot;.
* Yellow indicates &quot;caution&quot;.
* Green indicates &quot;permission to run&quot;.
* White indicates &quot;clear line&quot;.

== Light signals ==
Light signals show one of the following aspects:

=== Main signals ===
==== Fail safe ====
If one of the green lights in signal 22 fails, the indication becomes the lower speed signal 21 – this is fail-safe. Other nearby countries reverse the role of the single green aspect and double green aspect.

=== Distant signals ===
==== Wrong-side failure ====
If the yellow light in signal 24 fails, the signal displays a higher speed indication, which would be a wrong-side failure. To prevent this, a current transformer in the lamp circuit monitors the current through the yellow lamp. If the yellow lamp fails, a relay will also switch off the green light and the signal becomes totally dark, which is then treated as &quot;expect stop.&quot; A capacitor in the relay circuit ensures that the relay operation is a couple of seconds delayed, to prevent the relay operating for every blink. Hence, if the yellow lamp does suddenly fail, the green light will blink alone 1-2 times before it is switched off by the relay. Note: The animated picture of signal 24 is wrongly giving the impression that the yellow light is shown before the green one. This is not correct: The yellow and green lights are always switched on and off simultaneously, for every blink/flash.

== Warning systems ==
Norway uses the Ericsson ATP warning system, also used on Perth&#x27;s suburban railway network.

<text>The Folklands (Folklanden) is the name for the original Swedish provinces of Tiundaland, Attundaland, Fjärdhundraland, and Roden (Roslagen) which in the 1296 united to form the province of Uppland. They were originally united by electing a common king who administered the sacrifices at Uppsala and who was the commander of the leidang during wars. It is not known when they united for the first time, but already in 98 AD, Tacitus described the Suiones as a powerful tribe.

== Modern usage ==
The term &quot;Folkland&quot;, in the transferred sense of originally independent subprovinces, has by modern historians also been used to refer to the similar traditional provinces of the areas which later became the unified provinces of Hälsingland and Småland.

<doc id="1058606" wikidata="Q7557125" url="?curid=1058606" title="Solax Studios">
<text>Solax Studios was an American motion-picture studio founded in 1910 by executives from the Gaumont Film Company of France. Alice Guy-Blaché, her husband Herbert, and a third partner, George A. Magie, established the Solax Company.

Guy-Blaché was artistic director and the director for many of the studio&#x27;s films, while her husband Herbert managed production for the new company. They took over the studio Gaumont had built in Flushing, New York in 1908 for the production of Chronophone sound films, a venture which proved unsuccessful for Gaumont. Solax produced silent films in Flushing from October 1910 to the summer of 1912. Prospering, Solax invested more than $100,000 in a modern production plant in 1912 in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which had become the center of America&#x27;s first motion picture industry.

This was a time when the American film industry was rapidly changing from little more than a scientific curiosity to an important sector of the economic engine driving the economy. In this environment, Solax was conceived as an all-in-one operation with its own film processing laboratory and state of the art stages built under a glass roof. In addition to administrative offices, production facilities included dressing rooms, a set-fabrication workshop, and a costume-design department with a sewing room.

In 1912, the studio made a short film titled &quot;A Fool and His Money&quot;, directed by Guy-Blaché. It is believed to be the first film ever made with an all-African-American cast. The film is now at the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute.

Metro Pictures (now MGM) began its business life in 1916 primarily as a distributor of successful Solax films. Several emerging stars appeared in Solax films including Lionel and Ethel Barrymore, Claire Whitney, Olga Petrova, and Billy Quirk.

In between their own productions, the Blachés leased the studios to other production companies such as the Goldwyn Picture Corporation and Selznick International Pictures. However, Solax and the rest of the East Coast film industry rapidly declined throughout the 1920s as a result of the phenomenal growth of motion-picture facilities in Hollywood, California that offered lower costs and a climate that accommodated year-round filming.

Inadequate firefighting methods resulted in the destruction of Solax Film Laboratories in Fort Lee, New Jersey in 1919.

<text>Alan Dennis Kulwicki (December 14, 1954 – April 1, 1993), nicknamed &quot;Special K&quot; and &quot;the Polish Prince&quot;, was an American auto racing driver and team owner. He started racing at local short tracks in Wisconsin before moving up to regional stock car touring series. Kulwicki arrived at NASCAR, the highest and most expensive level of stock car racing in the United States, with no sponsor, a limited budget and only a racecar and a borrowed pickup truck. Despite starting with meager equipment and finances, he earned the 1986 NASCAR Rookie of the Year award over drivers racing for well-funded teams.

After Kulwicki won his first race at Phoenix International Raceway, he debuted what would become his trademark &quot;Polish victory lap&quot;. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by what was then the closest margin in NASCAR history. He died early in 1993 in a light aircraft accident and therefore never defended his championship. He has been inducted into numerous racing halls of fame and was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 greatest drivers.

Kulwicki was known for being a perfectionist and doing things his own way. An engineer by trade, his scientific approach to NASCAR racing inspired the way teams are now run. Despite lucrative offers from top car owners, he insisted on driving for his own race team, AK Racing, during most of his NASCAR career. Described by his publicist as &quot;a real hard type of person to get to know&quot;, he remained a bachelor throughout his life.

==Early life==
Kulwicki grew up in Greenfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee known for its Polish-American neighborhoods, near the Milwaukee Mile racetrack. After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee and received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1977. His knowledge of engineering has been cited as a contributing factor to his success as a driver, as it helped him better understand the physics of a racecar. He first raced on local tracks as an amateur while in college before becoming a full-time professional racer in 1980. A devout Roman Catholic, Kulwicki always competed with a Saint Christopher (the patron saint of travelers) devotional medal in his car.

==Early racing career==
Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey&#x27;s United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki&#x27;s father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki&#x27;s resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. &quot;I showed him how&quot;, Gerry Kulwicki said. &quot;And he said: &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you do it? You can do it better.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.&#x27;&quot;

Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973 he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners and the next year started racing late models – the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level – at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo&#x27;s Speedway in Oshkosh.

Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships.

In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki&#x27;s highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions.

== NASCAR ==

=== Early 1980s ===
Kulwicki raced in four NASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) races in 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was considered NASCAR&#x27;s feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers who wished to step up to the organization&#x27;s premiere circuit, the Winston Cup (now NASCAR Cup Series). Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which took place at the Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year&#x27;s event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki&#x27;s Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry&#x27;s eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.

In 1985, Kulwicki sold most of his belongings, including his short track racing equipment, to move approximately to the Charlotte area in North Carolina. He kept only a few things; his pickup truck was loaded to tow a trailer full of furniture and tools. An electrical fire two days before he left destroyed his truck, so Kulwicki had to borrow one to pull the trailer. After arriving in the Charlotte area, he showed up unannounced at Terry&#x27;s shop ready to race. Veteran NASCAR drivers were initially amused by Kulwicki&#x27;s arrival on the national tour: He was a driver from the northern United States when the series was primarily a southern regional series, he had a mechanical engineering degree when few other drivers had completed college and, with only six starts, had limited driving experience in the junior Busch Series. Kulwicki was described as very studious, hard working, no-nonsense and something of a loner. He frequently walked the garage area in his racing uniform carrying a briefcase. Kulwicki made his first career Winston Cup start at Richmond on September 8, 1985, for Bill Terry&#x27;s No. 32 Hardee&#x27;s Ford team. That season he competed in five races for Terry, with his highest finish being 13th.

=== 1987–1989 ===
Kulwicki started his rookie season in 1986 with Terry, who switched his car number from 32 to 35 and had received sponsorship from the restaurant chain Quincy&#x27;s Steak House. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, he sold the team to his driver. Kulwicki as an owner started out as essentially a one-man team, as he had to serve as driver, team administrator, crew chief and chief mechanic. Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded and because he was hands-on in the maintenance of racecars to the point of being a &quot;control freak&quot;. He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted six weeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, &quot;The man was a genius. There&#x27;s no question. It&#x27;s not a matter of people just feeling like he was a genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone.&quot; With one car, two engines, and two full-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29 events, with four top 10 finishes, three races not completed (Did Not Finish – DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.

For the 1987 season Kulwicki secured primary sponsorship from Zerex Antifreeze and changed his car number to seven. He picked up his first career pole position in the season&#x27;s third race, at Richmond. Later that season, he again qualified fastest at Richmond and Dover. Kulwicki came close to winning his first Winston Cup race at Pocono, finishing second after winner Dale Earnhardt passed him on the last lap. With nine top 10 finishes, eleven DNFs and an average finish of 18.2 in 29 events; Kulwicki finished 15th in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.
In 1988 Kulwicki hired Paul Andrews as his crew chief after Andrews was recommended by Rusty Wallace at the 1987 NASCAR Awards banquet. That year Kulwicki won his first NASCAR Winston Cup race in the season&#x27;s second-to-last race at Phoenix International Raceway after race leader Ricky Rudd&#x27;s car had motor problems late in the race. Kulwicki led 41 laps and won by 18.5 seconds. After the race finished, he turned his car around and made, what he called, a &quot;Polish victory lap&quot; by driving the opposite way (clockwise) on the track, with the driver&#x27;s side of the car facing the fans. &quot;This gave me the opportunity to wave to the crowd from the driver&#x27;s side&quot;, Kulwicki explained. Andrews recalled, &quot;He had wanted to do something special and something different for his first win and only his first.&quot; He finished the 1988 season with four pole positions in 29 events, nine top 10 finishes including two second-place finishes, twelve DNFs, and an average finish of 19.2. Kulwicki finished 14th in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.

Kulwicki started his own engine-building program for the 1989 season. He had four second place finishes that season and held the points lead after the fifth race of the season. The team dropped from fourth to fifteenth in points by suffering nine engine failures during a sixteen-race stretch in the middle of the season. In 29 races, he had six pole positions, nine top 10 finishes, and finished 14th in season points. The team had a new workshop built during the season.

=== 1990–1991 ===
Junior Johnson, owner of one of the top NASCAR teams, approached Kulwicki at the beginning of the 1990 season to try to get him to replace Terry Labonte in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Kulwicki declined, stating that he was more interested in running his own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top 10 points in a season. In 29 races, he had thirteen top 10 finishes and one pole position.

After the 1990 season, Kulwicki lost his primary sponsor after Ashland, Inc., the makers of Zerex, chose instead to use its Valvoline motor oil brand to replace Folgers Coffee and sponsor Mark Martin at Roush Racing. He once again received an offer from Junior Johnson, this time for $1 million, but as he had before he rejected the overture. Part of the reason for Kulwicki&#x27;s decision was tied to a sponsorship deal with Kraft General Foods to carry the company&#x27;s Maxwell House Coffee brand, which had yet to be finalized. Johnson, angry at being spurned again by Kulwicki, then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team&#x27;s expenses out of his own pocket.

At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, five cars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War in what was the first ever instance of special liveries being used in NASCAR; Kulwicki was one of the five drivers, striking an agreement with the Army to sponsor his car for the race. He went on to finish in eighth place, climbing from 27th. Kulwicki then finished fifth at Richmond and seventeenth at Rockingham, running a plain white car carrying only his team&#x27;s insignia on it.

The next race, the Motorcraft Quality Parts 500, was at Atlanta, and Kulwicki caught a break that would result in a long-term partnership. Kulwicki placed his unsponsored #7 on the pole for the race, for which 47 cars attempted to qualify. Among these was the #82 Hooters Ford, which was being driven by Mark Stahl (like Kulwicki, an owner-driver) and had failed to qualify for the first three events of the season. Atlanta Motor Speedway was considered to be Hooters&#x27; home track, as the restaurant chain is based in Atlanta, and having a car make the event would help give them some visibility both at the track and for the home television audience. They would not get it from Stahl, as he once again failed to qualify.

Since Hooters executives desired a spot in the race, and Kulwicki needed a sponsor, both sides met to discuss terms for the polesitter. The principals agreed to at least a one-race deal, which became a much longer-term deal when Kulwicki recorded an eighth-place finish in the race. Later in the season, Kulwicki won the Bristol night race for his third career win. In addition to the win, Kulwicki finished the season with 11 top 10 finishes, four poles, and a 13th-place points finish.

=== 1992: Championship Season ===
Kulwicki started out the year by having to take one of two provisional starting positions at the Daytona 500; he ended up finishing fourth. He passed Dale Jarrett with 27 laps left at the Food City 500 race on April 5 at Bristol to take a narrow victory. It was his fourth Winston Cup victory. After that race, he never left the top five in season points. Andrews attributed Kulwicki&#x27;s consistently strong finishes to the steady performance of newly adopted radial tires throughout their lifespan. He said, &quot;It was hard to control them, and the driver&#x27;s ability to work with that car during practice in order to get the car set up meant so much more than it ever did.&quot; Kulwicki&#x27;s second victory in the season was at the first race at Pocono, which was the first time he had won on a superspeedway. Discounted as a contender for the season championship during the year, Kulwicki was expected to fade from contention as Bill Elliott and Davey Allison, both of whom had won more races than Kulwicki and who had traded the points lead between them, were both having strong seasons and looked to be the favorites for the Winston Cup. He did not, however, and remained in the top 5 in the series standings.

He qualified on the pole position for the Peak AntiFreeze 500 race on September 20 at Dover, but crashed early in the race and finished 34th. At the conclusion of the race, Kulwicki trailed points leader Elliott by 278 points and second place Allison by 124. He seemed to resign himself to another season without a championship, saying to reporters, &quot;This probably finishes us off in the championship deal.&quot;

However, Kulwicki was able to benefit from bad fortune that would befall Elliott in the weeks ahead. The next week at Martinsville, Elliott fell out of the race with a blown engine while Kulwicki finished fifth. Kulwicki followed that up with a twelfth-place run at North Wilkesboro, a second place at Charlotte, and another twelfth-place finish at Rockingham. While Elliott managed a fourth-place finish at Rockingham, he ran twenty-sixth at North Wilkesboro with handling problems and thirtieth at Charlotte after his car&#x27;s sway bar broke. Allison too had not run well over the same four races; brake failure late in the race at Martinsville left him 16th, ill-handling cars relegated him to 11th and 19th at North Wilkesboro and Charlotte, and he could only manage 10th place at Rockingham. This left Kulwicki just 70 points behind Elliott and a mere 15 points behind Allison with two races left.

Then, at Phoenix, Kulwicki ran fourth while Elliott suffered overheating problems and a cracked cylinder head. He once again finished outside of the top 30. Allison won the race, retaking the points lead, but Kulwicki&#x27;s performance left him within striking distance of the points lead. When the points standings were tabulated after the race, Kulwicki had surpassed Elliott in the standings and stood thirty points behind Allison.


Thus, the stage was set for the final race of the season, the Hooters 500 at Atlanta. Before the race, Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; lettering on his bumper for the race to &quot;underbird&quot; because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship.

Kulwicki qualified for the race in fourteenth position, three spots behind Elliott and three spots ahead of Allison. Allison simply needed to finish fifth or better to clinch the Cup, regardless of what his cohorts did. Atlanta, however, was not one of his better tracks, as he had a string of inconsistent finishes there. He had, however, finished fourth in the spring race won by Elliott. Kulwicki needed to outpace both Elliott and Allison and put as much distance as he could between the two drivers because he not only had to make up the thirty points on points leader Allison, but also needed to put distance between himself and Elliott, who trailed him by only ten points.

Kulwicki narrowly avoided an incident on the second lap of the race as front row starters Rick Mast and Brett Bodine spun out. However, trouble would eventually find him on the first round of pit stops. As Kulwicki was getting ready to leave his pit box after service, he shifted into first gear and his car stalled. He got a push start from his crew and upshifted into fourth gear, which enabled him to refire the car and head back out. Andrews later said, &quot;We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn&#x27;t get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or four pit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long.&quot; While Kulwicki had no choice but to keep his car in top gear, which caused his pit stop times to be much slower than usual, he was one of the faster drivers on track that day and he quickly gained positions once back up to speed. He eventually caught up to Elliott, who was also running well, and the two began jockeying back and forth for positions; eventually,
Kulwicki found his way to the front of the field and held onto the lead despite the best efforts of the #11 team. Then, on lap 255, Kulwicki got a break he desperately needed. Allison was running in sixth place at the time, and since he had led a lap during the course of the event was still leading the championship. As he was coming off of turn four, Ernie Irvan spun out in front of the field on the frontstretch. Irvan, who had been running three laps down at the time, came down in front of Allison, who was unable to avoid him and the two made contact and crashed into the inside wall near the start/finish line. Allison&#x27;s car was badly damaged in the incident, and although the damage would be able to be repaired in the garage his chances of winning the Winston Cup were over.

Under the ensuing caution, Kulwicki and Andrews went to work on discussing strategy for the remainder of the race. With Allison now out of the championship picture, maximizing track position and points became Kulwicki&#x27;s focus. He and Elliott had each gained five bonus points for leading a lap, and five additional bonus points were available for the driver who led the most laps during the race. However, despite the possibility for more caution periods, Kulwicki would have to pit at some point to get enough fuel in the car to make it to the advertised distance. Therefore, Kulwicki and Andrews decided to stay out as long as they could and lead as many laps as possible. Once the race resumed, Kulwicki was able to maintain his lead on Elliott despite the best efforts of the latter.

On lap 310, after leading 101 consecutive laps and 103 overall, Kulwicki came down pit road for a fuel-only stop. Since the team did not need a full twenty-two gallon load of fuel to make it to the end and they needed to save as much time as they could, Andrews made the determination to put approximately half a can of gasoline into Kulwicki&#x27;s tank; this could be done in a little over three seconds and with only two crew members. Fuel man Tony Gibson and catch can man Peter Jellen waited as Kulwicki pulled in. There was a problem with the fuel relay, however, and Gibson was not certain of the amount of gasoline that made it into the tank. Kulwicki came back onto the track in third place, behind front runner Elliott and second place Terry Labonte. He had not fully secured the five bonus points for leading the most laps, since Elliott had an opportunity to tie Kulwicki&#x27;s total. In that case, both drivers would receive the points. Elliott also had to come down to top off his fuel tank.

But as he had done with the adjustment following the broken gearbox and the accident that took Allison out of the race, Kulwicki once again caught a break that affected his chances in a significant way. Tim Brewer, Elliott&#x27;s crew chief, had lost track of Labonte, as had the ESPN television broadcast. Brewer called Elliott in on lap 314, unaware that Labonte was still on the race track. Labonte was able to pass Elliott while he pitted, then pitted himself one lap later. Elliott reassumed the point with twelve laps remaining, which when added to the ninety he had already led would only add up to 102. However, even if Elliott had waited an additional lap to pit, he still would&#x27;ve only led 103 laps, the same as Kulwicki. Under the rules in place at the time, if two drivers tied for the most laps led during a race, both would be awarded the 5 bonus points. This would still have left Elliott behind Kulwicki on points if they stayed running as they were, but also would have taken away some margin for error from Kulwicki as he needed to stay in a position where he would finish ahead of Elliott in the points; a tie, which was possible, would be broken by whoever won more races and Kulwicki&#x27;s two wins would not be enough.

Kulwicki was told that he had clinched the five extra points several laps later. Andrews warned him of the fuel relay issue, however, and told Kulwicki to conserve whatever fuel he could as no one knew for certain whether or not Gibson had done the job. Kulwicki was running in second, far enough ahead of third place Geoff Bodine that he was not a factor, and thus all he had to do was hold position in order to win the championship. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.

Kulwicki had overcome the 278-point deficit in the final six races of the season by ending with a fifth, a fourth, and two second-place finishes. Kulwicki won the championship because of his consistent high finishes. It was the closest title win in NASCAR Cup Series history until the implementation of the Chase for the Cup format in 2004. Kulwicki was the last owner-driver to win the title for nearly two decades, the first Cup champion with a college degree, and the first Cup champion born in a northern state. He started from the pole position six times during the season, which was the most for any driver. The song that played during a short salute to Kulwicki at the year-end awards banquet was Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;.

==== Championship honors ====
Kulwicki returned to his hometown, Greenfield, for Alan Kulwicki Day in January 1993. The gymnasium at Greenfield High School was filled and surrounded by four to five thousand people. Local television crews filmed the event. Kulwicki signed autographs for six hours.

In celebration of his championship, sponsor Hooters made a special &quot;Alan Tribute Card&quot; that was used at all of the autograph sessions during the 1993 season.

=== 1993 ===
Kulwicki did not significantly change his spending habits after winning the 1992 championship. &quot;The only thing I really wanted to buy was a plane&quot;, he said, &quot;but it turns out Hooters has a couple I can use.&quot; Kulwicki negotiated a lease agreement with Hooters Chairman Robert Brooks for the use of one of his aircraft. The Swearingen Merlin III twin turboprop Kulwicki leased was painted with Hooters livery, and its FAA registry changed from N300EF (for Eastern Foods, another of Brooks&#x27;s companies) to N300AK.

After the first five races of the 1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series had been completed, Kulwicki was 9th in overall points. Kulwicki had concerns about how often he was being allowed to use the airplane he had leased, and other financial concerns he wanted to bring up with his sponsor, Hooters. The PR representative for both Hooters and Kulwicki, Tom Roberts, suggested that Kulwicki bring up his concerns to Hooters leadership while in flight from Knoxville to Bristol on the evening of April 1, 1993, en route to the 1993 Food City 500. Roberts himself, in an attempt to avoid a conflict of interest between the two sides, did not board the chartered flight, and took a commercial flight to Bristol instead.

==Death==

Kulwicki died in an airplane crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters on the Kingston Pike, in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport in a field off of Interstate 81 near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot&#x27;s failure to use the airplane&#x27;s anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.

Kulwicki was buried at St. Adalbert&#x27;s Cemetery in Milwaukee; the funeral was attended by NASCAR President Bill France Jr. and numerous drivers. Kulwicki&#x27;s racecar transporter was driven from the rainy track later that Friday morning while other teams and the media watched it travel slowly around the track with a black wreath on its grille. As the transporter passed the start / finish line, the flagman waved a checkered flag. In 2008, Kyle Petty described the slow laps as &quot;the saddest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen at a racetrack... We just sat and cried.&quot; Kulwicki had competed in five NASCAR races that season with two Top 5 finishes, and was ranked ninth in points at his death. In his career, he had won five NASCAR Winston Cup races, 24 pole positions, 75 Top 10 finishes, and one championship in 207 races.

His car was driven by road course specialist Tommy Kendall on road courses and by Jimmy Hensley at the other tracks. It was raced for most of the 1993 season until the team was sold to Geoff Bodine, who operated it as Geoff Bodine Racing.

Kulwicki had been selected to compete in the 1993 International Race of Champions (IROC) series as the reigning Winston Cup champion. He competed in two IROC races before his death, finishing ninth at Daytona and eleventh at Darlington. Dale Earnhardt raced for Kulwicki in the final two IROC races, and the prize money for those races and their fifth place combined points finish was given to the Winston Cup Racing Wives Auxiliary, Brenner Children&#x27;s Hospital and St. Thomas Aquinas Church charities.

==Legacy==
Three days after Kulwicki&#x27;s death, Bristol race winner Rusty Wallace honored his former short track rival by performing Kulwicki&#x27;s trademark Polish victory lap. Davey Allison died on July 13, 1993; competitors who had been carrying a No. 7 sticker in memory of Kulwicki added a No. 28 sticker for Allison. After the final race of the season, series champion Dale Earnhardt and race winner Wallace drove a side-by-side Polish victory lap carrying flags for Kulwicki and Allison. Kulwicki finished 41st in the final points standings despite competing in only five races. Racing Champions issued a die-cast version of Alan Kulwicki&#x27;s No. 7 car that was a tribute to Kulwicki&#x27;s 1992 title.

The USAR Hooters Pro Cup championship (now CARS Tour) held the &quot;Four Champions Challenge&quot; in memory of the four victims of the plane crash. Established in 1997, the challenge was a four-race series, with each race named after one of the four who died in the crash: Kulwicki, Mark Brooks (son of Hooters owner Bob Brooks), Dan Duncan, and pilot Charles Campbell.

Milwaukee County honored Kulwicki in 1996 by creating Alan Kulwicki Memorial Park, located near the corner of Highway 100 and Cold Spring Road in Greenfield (Area Map). Hooters chairman Robert Brooks donated $250,000 to build the park, which features a Kulwicki museum inside the Brooks Pavilion.

Since 1994, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has awarded the Alan Kulwicki Memorial Scholarship to one incoming student each year. Scholarship winners are outstanding high school seniors who plan to major in mechanical engineering. By 1998, UNC Charlotte created an automotive and motorsports engineering program.

In October 2009, the Kulwicki family donated nearly $1.9 million to benefit motorsports engineering education at UNC Charlotte. In honor of the gift, the university&#x27;s board of trustees renamed the existing motorsports research facility the Alan D. Kulwicki Motorsports Laboratory. The donation funded the construction of a second motorsports engineering building, which opened in January 2012.
Bristol Motor Speedway named its grandstand in turns one and two in honor of Kulwicki, as well as a terrace above the grandstand. The 2004 Busch Series race at the Milwaukee Mile was named the &quot;Alan Kulwicki 250&quot; in honor of Kulwicki. Wisconsinite Paul Menard turned his car around after winning the 2006 Busch Series event and performed a Polish victory lap to honor Kulwicki. Slinger Super Speedway has held an annual Alan Kulwicki Memorial race since 1994.

Kulwicki was posthumously inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2002. He was inducted in the Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway Court of Legends in 1993, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993, Talladega-Texaco Hall of Fame in 1996, Bristol Motor Speedway Heroes of Bristol Hall of Fame in 1997, the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2010. Kulwicki was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2019.

Kulwicki&#x27;s success as an owner-driver sparked a small trend among NASCAR veterans. Geoff Bodine, his younger brother Brett, Ricky Rudd, Bill Elliott, and Joe Nemechek all began racing teams shortly after Kulwicki&#x27;s death. However, none were as successful as Kulwicki&#x27;s. Robby Gordon frequently mentions Alan as an inspiration for him as an owner-driver, and selected car No. 7 as a tribute to Kulwicki.

Slinger Super Speedway began an Alan Kulwicki Memorial night in 1993; it has continued the annual memorial as of 2016. In 2010, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee created the Alan Kulwicki Memorial Student Center in their Engineering and Mathematical Sciences Building. The center, along with a scholarship for engineering students, was made possible in part by a donation from Thelma H. Kulwicki, the late racer&#x27;s stepmother, who also donated numerous items of memorabilia located in the center.

In May 2012, the Milwaukee County Historical Society announced plans for a special exhibit celebrating the life and career of Kulwicki to open in early 2013. The exhibit is called &quot;Alan Kulwicki: A Champion&#x27;s Story&quot;.

===Alan Kulwicki Driver Development Program===

In 2015, Kulwicki&#x27;s friends began the Alan Kulwicki Driver Development program to &quot;help worthy drivers along the way in reaching their dream...while at the same time keep Alan Kulwicki&#x27;s memory and legacy alive.&quot; The field is narrowed to 15 applicants and the program gives $7777 to support seven drivers&#x27; career advancement. Drivers are judged based on their on-track performance as well as off-track activities, social media presence, and community involvement. The winner receives seven times $7777 ($54,439) and a trophy. It was cancelled for the 2020 season because of COVID-19 concerns. The program winners were:

==Media==
Father Dale Grubba, the priest who had presided over Kulwicki&#x27;s funeral, released a biography of his friend entitled &quot;Alan Kulwicki: NASCAR champion Against All Odds&quot; in 2009. The book was the basis for a low-budget feature film, &quot;Dare to Dream: The Alan Kulwicki Story&quot;, released on April 1, 2005. The film chronicles Kulwicki&#x27;s life from racing late models at Slinger Super Speedway, through his rise to NASCAR champion, and ends with his death. The movie was created by Kulwicki&#x27;s Wisconsin fans for less than $100,000. The star of the film, Brad Weber, was a Kulwicki fan and credits the late driver with being his inspiration to become an actor.

<text>The Seattle Japanese Garden is a Japanese garden in the Madison Park neighborhood of Seattle. The garden is located in the southern end of the Washington Park Arboretum on Lake Washington Boulevard East. The garden is one of the oldest Japanese gardens in North America, and is regarded as one of the most authentic Japanese gardens in the United States.

==History==

Proposals to construct a Japanese garden in Seattle date back to the 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition, which included a temporary Japanese Pavilion with a garden for the world&#x27;s fair. The new Washington Park Arboretum was proposed as the site of the garden by 1937, but its construction was not undertaken at the time due to racial tensions and the onset of World War II. The Arboretum Foundation began fundraising for the project in 1957 ahead of the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair and consulted with Japanese diplomats based in Seattle to solicit donations and potential designs. Fujitaro Kubota, a local gardener and landscaper who later donated Kubota Garden to the city, provided the initial cost estimates to the foundation. A team of six landscape architects and designers, led by Kiyoshi Inoshita and Juki Iida, were selected by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and presented their plans for the Seattle garden in 1958.

Iida selected Japanese American contractors for the project due to their familiarity with the Japanese language and aesthetics; they included William Yorozu for plants, Richard Yamasaki for stone setting, and Kei Ishimitsu for garden structures. The teahouse was gifted to the city by the Tokyo government and shipped in pieces in March 1959; it was assembled for temporary display at a trade fair the following month before construction of its permanent home began on May 19. The first tea ceremony was conducted on July 4, 1959, by visiting Urasenke grand master Sen Sōshitsu XV.

Construction began in late 1959 and used primarily local materials, including of granite boulders from Bandera Mountain that were selected by Iida during a trip to the Snoqualmie Pass area. The boulders ranged in size from 1,000 pounds to 11 tons and were wrapped in bamboo matting to be transported to Seattle. They were arranged to complement a variety of culturally appropriate azaleas, rhododendrons, camellias, mosses, and ferns that were planted beginning in March 1960; some 100 flowering trees were donated by members of the public, primarily from Japanese American associations. The garden was dedicated by Seattle mayor Gordon S. Clinton on June 5, 1960.

During their October 1960 stop in Seattle, the Japanese Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko visited the newly opened garden. Together, they planted a cherry tree and a white birch, the latter a symbol () of the Princess&#x27;s family. Access to the garden was initially free until turnstiles with a 10-cent fee were installed in May 1961.

The original teahouse was burned by vandals on April 9, 1973, and reconstructed by Yasunori &quot;Fred&quot; Sugita in 1980 and 1981. It took eight years for the Arboretum Foundation to raise $175,000, with assistance from the Urasenke Foundation, until the teahouse was ready to be rebuilt. The teahouse was rededicated by Sen Sōshitsu XV on May 16, 1981, and named &quot;Shoseian&quot;.

The garden has undertaken several other infrastructure improvements, including a new gatehouse and community meeting room. Several paths were modified to comply with wheelchair accessibility requirements in the late 1990s. The garden underwent a major renovation from 2001 to 2002 to restore the eroded pond and replace deteriorating bridges and plants. The Gatehouse project was completed in 2009. The new structure includes a bronze gate designed by a local Seattle sculptor Gerard Tsutakawa. As part of planning for the project, the garden was designated as a city historical landmark by the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board on May 21, 2008.

The garden was awarded the Japanese Foreign Minister&#x27;s Commendation for its contributions to the promotion of mutual understanding between Japan and the United States on December 1, 2020.

==Cultural events==

The Seattle Japanese Garden hosts several cultural celebrations throughout the year, including:
*&quot;Kodomo no Hi&quot; (Children&#x27;s Day)
*&quot;Tanabata&quot;
* Wondering and Wandering
*&quot;Otsukimi&quot; (Moon Viewing)
*&quot;Keiro no Hi&quot; (Respect for Elders Day)
*&quot;Momijigari&quot; (Maple Viewing)

These special cultural events feature local performers, including calligraphers, taiko ensembles, dance troupes, and traditional musicians.

== Community partners ==
The Seattle Japanese Garden is a partnership between the City of Seattle, the Associated Recreation Council (The Seattle Japanese Garden Advisory Council) and the Washington Park Arboretum.

<text>The Lockheed XB-30 (company model L-249) was the design submitted by Lockheed after the request by the United States Army Air Forces for a very heavy bomber, the same request that led to the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the Douglas XB-31 and Consolidated B-32 Dominator.

==Design and development==
Around 1938, General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, the head of the United States Army Air Corps, was growing alarmed at the possibility of war in Europe and in the Pacific. Hoping to be prepared for the long-term requirements of the Air Corps, Arnold created a special committee chaired by Brigadier General Walter G. Kilner; one of its members was Charles Lindbergh. After a tour of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bases, Lindbergh became convinced that Nazi Germany was far ahead of other European nations.

In a 1939 report, the committee made a number of recommendations, including development of new long-range heavy bombers. When war broke out in Europe, Arnold requested design studies from several companies on a Very Long-Range bomber capable of traveling . Approval was granted on 2 December 1939.

Based on the design of the Lockheed L-049 (subsequently adopted by the United States Army Air Forces as the C-69), the L-249 never progressed past the design stage, mainly because Boeing had a head start with its Boeing B-29 Superfortress , using the same Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radials as the XB-30 was intended to use. Only a scale model was built. Retaining the wings and tail surfaces of the Model 49, the Model 249-58-01 was to have had a new fuselage with up to six gun turrets (one in the nose, two above and two below the fuselage, and one in the tail) housing ten .50-caliber guns—twinned up in each turret for the nose, dorsal, and ventral emplacements; and one 20-mm cannon for the tail defensive position. Ventral bomb bays were to accommodate eight bombs.

<text>Sociocultural anthropology is a term used to refer to social anthropology and cultural anthropology together. It is one of the four main branches of anthropology. Sociocultural anthropologists focus on the study of society and culture, while often interested in cultural diversity and universalism.

Sociocultural anthropologists recognise a change in the nature of the field and that a previous focus on traditional tribal perspectives has shifted to a contemporary understanding. Methodologies have altered accordingly, and the discipline continues to evolve with that of society. Globalisation has contributed to the changing influence of the state on individuals and their interactions.

==Overview==
The rubric &quot;cultural&quot; anthropology is generally applied to ethnographic works that are holistic in approach, are oriented to the ways in which culture affects individual experience, or aim to provide a rounded view of the knowledge, customs, and institutions of a people. Cultural anthropology focuses on how individuals make sense of the world around them using knowledge, beliefs, morals, arts, laws and customs of groups.

&quot;Social&quot; anthropology is a term applied to ethnographic works that attempt to isolate a particular system of social relations such as those that comprise domestic life, economy, law, politics, or religion, give analytical priority to the organizational bases of social life, and attend to cultural phenomena as somewhat secondary to the main issues of social scientific inquiry.

Sociocultural anthropology, which is understood to include linguistic anthropology, is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose through the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the nation-state to theorizations about culture and power. New challenges have emerged as public debates about multiculturalism and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology.

==History ==
The synergy of sociology and anthropology was initially developed during the early 1920s by European scholars. Both disciplines shared a common search for a science of society. During the 20th century, the disciplines diverged further to as cultural studies were integrated, centralising geographical and methodological features.

=== 1920s-50s ===
&#x27;Social&#x27; and &#x27;cultural&#x27; anthropology was developed in the 1920s. It was associated with the social sciences and linguistics rather than the human biology and archaeology studied in anthropology. Specialists in the respective fields of social and cultural anthropology were elemental in the foundations of the later developed synergy. Radcliffe-Brown and Bronislaw Malinowski marked the point of differentiation between social and cultural anthropology in 1930, evident in texts from this period. In the 1930s and 40s, an influx of monographs and comparative studies of &#x27;tribal societies&#x27; emerged. Meyer Fortes and Edward Evans Pritchard described and classified African societies in &quot;African Political Systems&quot; (1940). Their comparative anthology aimed to provide a basis for sociological knowledge by classifying kin-based bans instead of relying on empirical observation.

Claude Lévi-Strauss, used structuralism as a way to analyse cultural systems in terms of their structural relations, including that of kinship. In 1949, he attempted to classify marriage systems from diverse locations. Structuralism was applied to anthropology by Lévi-Strauss to reaffirms the coexistence between the individual and society and categorise information about cultural systems by the formal relationships among their elements. Structuralism remains a central concept involved in the study of sociocultural anthropology.

=== 1960s–90s ===
Before WWII, &#x27;social&#x27; anthropology and &#x27;cultural&#x27; anthropology were still separate entities in the field. The war called upon anthropologists from all countries to assist in the war effort. Anthropologists were extensively involved in resettlements in Europe and consulting issues of racial status in occupied areas. Ethical issues surrounding the allies involvement were topical among anthropologists and institutional development and practiced methodologies were altered by programs in &#x27;developing countries&#x27;. As developing countries grew independence, they grew a dislike for an apparent imperialistic nature of anthropological studies, declining work in the field. After the war, anthropologists collaborated ideas and methodologies to form the collective &#x27;sociocultural anthropology&#x27;. Topical interests included that of religion, kingship, acculturation, function, and community studies.

During the 1970s, public spending was increased in most industrialised counties which expanded social rights, produced dramatic rises in wealth, living standards and overall equity. This neoliberal globalisation movement followed through until the 1990s. Increased spending assisted to provide academic opportunity in anthropology during 1974–1990. After this period, a steady decline in anthropology opportunity is the continued trend. The drastic growth of students in Ph.D. and M.A. programs, decline in university funding, downward shift in birth rates and decreased government funding are contributors to anthropologies current state.

=== 2000s–present ===
Traditional methodologies used to study sociocultural anthropology have changed with the shift in culture in modernised society. Individuals undergo daily routines differing to that of previous decades. Individuals participate in minority groups within which only certain aspects relate to the broader national culture. Anthropologists are unable to receive a holistic ethnography, as individuals return to the private sphere after interacting within their minority groups. Impacts of globalisation, neoliberalism, and capitalism have contributed to the decline in anthropology field work.

The job market of the 2000s is centralised around those occupations that are income generating, reducing the number of university students in the social science fields. In accordance, universities have reduced funding for many anthropological programs. The 2008 global financial crisis enhanced this effect as universities had to decline spending as income generation was lesser. Decreased spending in the anthropological sector in combination with an increasing trend of anthropology university students has results in decreasing job opportunities.

Sociocultural anthropological study of the 21st century, produces facts created by an intersection of cultural classification systems and heterogenous and dynamic societies. A contributor to this dynamic societal environment is the media. The influence of the media produces accessibility for all to gather experience and evidence, however charged political conditions sway social discourse. Anthropologists use theory such as structuralism to decipher epistemological obstacles. Considering that systems are defined by the laws of their constitutive elements rather than the content alone is a lens through which modern society is studied.

== Theoretical foundations ==

=== Concepts ===
Sociocultural anthropology divides into a broader national level and minority of subcultural groups to ethnographically study societies and cultures. The national culture is emitted through formally organised institutions including those of government forms and legal systems, economic institution, religious organisation, educational systems, law enforcement and military organisations. National achievements are influential on sociocultural integration however can be limited to upper class relevance only. Subcultural segments are groups of individuals behaving within the national culture. Subcultural groups are observed through vertical lens, differentiation because of national development, and horizontal lens, class and occupational divisions structured by societal hierarchy.

==== Human Migration ====
Human migration is a topic of anthropology which produced a macro and micro impact on society and its culture. Human migration is ‘the movement of persons away from their place of usual residence, either across an international border or within a state’. An interplay of social, political, economic, demographic, cultural and geographical factors remain central to the movement of individuals. Boas (1920) in his article &quot;The Methods of Ethnology&quot; (1920) states that it is the migration and dissemination of peoples rather than evolution that provides the basis for ethological research. Migration is accepted as the cause for the similarities of languages the dissemination of ideas and inventions across continents. The process of migration is responsible for the carrying of culture whilst the adaptation of culture to societies in different environments.

==== Linguistics ====
The discipline of linguistics is interrelated with the study of society and culture. Both fields share a common intellectual origin in 19th Century scholarship as archaeologists and early folklorists looked for origins of culture in folktales and shared memory. These early anthropologists narrowly focused on the influence structural codes had on the distinction between communities. The comparison of societies prompted early linguistic enquiries. In the 20th century, there became a distinction between linguistic anthropology and formal linguistics, with greater focus placed on the cultural and behaviour lens of language. Formal linguistics remains to be studied through a cognitive viewpoint. Linguistic anthropology looks at how language is used in the social and cultural life of people in different societies.Speech is used in societies as a system to indicate the series of certain events and how role relations effect such events.

==== Sociology ====
Sociocultural integration studies the interaction of the spheres and draws comparisons with alternate societies and cultures. Sociocultural anthropology is closely aligned with sociology sharing theoretical generalisation for social science and reflection of human lives. The 20th Century saw the separation of the two as differences in research topics, geographic focus and methodological emphasis diverged. Commonly, sociocultural anthropology centralises study of broader political, ethical, and economic subjects within small-scale societies whereas sociology looks at societies as a whole. Sociologically trained ethnographers have less regard for anthropological theory and place greater emphasis on empirical data. Recently, the two have reconverged as globalisation has aligned subject ideas and methodologies.

=== Methodologies ===
The traditional anthropological research method is to gather what people say and do through initial observations. Participant observation hinges on a synthesis of subjective insider and outsider elements. Insider elements rely on the fieldworker to learn what behaviour means to the people. Outsider elements are gathered through observations and experiences drawing comparisons with internal cultural customs and behaviours with alternate cultures. These observations are transferred into a monograph of elements sorted by importance and studied in relation to anthropological theories or questions. The process is controlled, and a hypothesis is tested reporting results after every return. Alternatively, the process may be more fortuitous if unique or unexpected events occur, and the writing processes is extended to make sense of elements.

Since the 1960s, anthropologists have recognised the importance of collaboration through reflections on experiences in the field, on relationships with informants and on contexts used to gather material. The reflections provide a better understanding for readers of ethnographic texts and anthropologists in practicing with awareness of their own biases and emotions when writing. This has led to advancements in the field of sociocultural anthropology.

Marxist and structuralist approaches include methods for gathering anthropological information that are challenged. Marxism validates the necessity for conventional field work, exploring the intersection between empirical observation and theoretical frameworks with the aim of improving each. Lévi-Straussian structuralists (Lévi-Strauss 1969) are more concerned with theoretical structures.

<text>Michael James Breaugh (September 13, 1942 – November 22, 2019) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1990, and in the House of Commons of Canada from a 1990 by-election until 1993.

==Background==
Breaugh was one of four sons of Thomas Breaugh and Marion Rush; his brothers were Harold, Patrick, and Tom. He was educated at Peterborough Teachers&#x27; College, Queen&#x27;s University, and the University of Toronto. A teacher by training, he served as an executive of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association.

==Politics==
He was first elected to public office in the 1975 Ontario election. A New Democrat, he won an easy victory in the working-class riding of Oshawa, while the NDP became the principal legislative opposition to the long-established Progressive Conservative government. He was re-elected in the 1977 election.

The NDP had seemed poised for an electoral breakthrough in 1977, but instead fell from second to third-place status in the legislature. When Stephen Lewis stepped down as Ontario NDP leader in 1978, Breaugh ran to succeed him. He received 499 votes at the 1978 NDP leadership convention, finishing a strong third in a field of three candidates. Most of his supporters went to Michael Cassidy rather than presumed frontrunner Ian Deans on the second ballot, giving Cassidy a narrow victory.

Breaugh was re-elected in the 1981 election, though by a narrower margin than before.

Breaugh had a poor relationship with Bob Rae, who succeeded Cassidy as party leader in 1982. The NDP experienced a modest recovery under Rae in the 1985 provincial election, and Breaugh was again re-elected by a significant margin in Oshawa. In the 1987 election, he defeated Liberal candidate Cathy O&#x27;Flynn by the reduced margin of 2,916 votes as the Liberals won a landslide provincial majority.

Breaugh often clashed with Rae in the 1980s, criticising his leadership. In 1990, he left Queen&#x27;s Park and ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, in a by-election called in the federal Oshawa riding to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of former federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent. Breaugh again defeated O&#x27;Flynn, now running for the Liberal Party of Canada, to win the by-election, which was held on August 13, a month before the 1990 Ontario election that brought Rae&#x27;s NDP to power.

Rae&#x27;s government was largely responsible for Breaugh&#x27;s defeat at the polls in 1993. The provincial NDP had by this time lost much of its support from organized labour, through austerity legislation known as the &quot;Social Contract&quot;. This had a detrimental effect on the federal NDP, which lost all ten of its Ontario seats in the 1993 federal election. Breaugh was unseated being reduced to a fourth-place finish in Oshawa, where the local branch of the Canadian Auto Workers had previously disaffiliated from the NDP.

He supported Howard Hampton as leader of the Ontario NDP in 1996.

Breaugh died on November 22, 2019.

<text>Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart (; 15 February 1739 – 6 June 1813) was a prominent French architect.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, France. A prominent member of Parisian society, in 1767, he married Anne-Louise d&#x27;Egremont. The couple became friends of the royal portrait painter, Marie Louise Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun who painted the portrait of their daughter, Alexandrine-Emilie Brongniart that now hangs in the National Gallery in London, Mademoiselle Brongniart 1788. During the Reign of Terror, Vigée-Lebrun hid in Brongniart&#x27;s home before fleeing the country.

Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart was also a close friend of Jean Antoine Houdon, the pre-eminent French sculptor of the day who sculpted busts of his daughter Alexandrine-Emilie and his son Alexandre Jr. that are now in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart designed hotels, including the Hôtel de Bourbon-Condé and the Hotel de Monaco, and a number of exclusive private residences. In 1781, he was received as a member of the Académie Royale d&#x27;Architecture, and in 1782, he was named architect and controller-general of the Ecole Militaire (Military School). In the same year, he refurbished the Hôtel de Besenval. In 1804, he was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte to create the layout for the famous Père Lachaise Cemetery. The Emperor was so pleased with his work that in 1807, he chose Brongniart to design the Paris Bourse (the Parisian stock exchange). Brongniart did all of the designs, but it would be his last work and he would not live to see the classical Greek styled building completed in 1825. The building was named &quot;Palais Brongniart&quot; in his honor and remains in use to this day.

Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart died in Paris in 1813 and was interred there in the cemetery he had designed.

==Family==
Brongniart&#x27;s son Alexandre went on to become a respected geologist and director of the famous Sèvres porcelain factory. In turn, his son Adolphe Theodore Brongniart became a famous botanist known as the father of paleobotany and a recipient of the Wollaston Medal in science text.

<doc id="1058649" wikidata="Q546633" url="?curid=1058649" title="Hanlin Academy">
<text>The Hanlin Academy was an academic and administrative institution of higher learning founded in the 8th century Tang China by Emperor Xuanzong in Chang&#x27;an. It has also been translated as &quot;College of Literature&quot; and &quot;Academy of the Forest of Pencils.&quot;

Membership in the academy was confined to an elite group of scholars, who performed secretarial and literary tasks for the court. One of its primary duties was to decide on an interpretation of the Chinese classics. This formed the basis of the Imperial examinations, which aspiring government bureaucrats had to pass to attain higher-level government posts. Painters working for the court were also attached to the academy.

==Academy members==
Some of the more famous academicians of Hanlin were:
* Li Bai (701–762) – Poet
* Bai Juyi (772–846) – Poet
* Su Shi (1037 – 1101) – Poet
* Yan Shu (991–1055) – Poet, calligrapher, (prime minister, 1042)
* Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) – Historian
* Shen Kuo (1031–1095) – Chancellor
* Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) – Painter
* Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) – Painter, calligrapher, poet (rector, 1314–1320)
* Huang Zicheng (1350–1402) – Imperial scholar
* Li Dongyang (1447–1516) – Imperial officer, poet, served as &#x27;Grand Historian&#x27;
* Ni Yuanlu (1593–1644) – Calligrapher, painter, high-ranking official
* Wu Renchen (1628–1689) – Historian and mathematician
* Chen Menglei (1650–1741) – Scholar, writer (Editor in Chief of the &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot;)
* Zhang Tingyu (1672–1755) – Politician and historian
* Ji Xiaolan (1724–1805) – Scholar, poet (Editor in Chief of the &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot;)
* Yao Nai (1731–1815) – Scholar
* Gao E (1738–1815) – Scholar and editor
* He Changling (1785–1848) – Scholar and official
* Zeng Guofan (1811–1872) – Scholar and later key military official
* Chen Lanbin (1816–1895) – Diplomat (ambassador to the U.S., Spain and Peru)
* Weng Tonghe (1830–1904) – Imperial Tutor
* Cai Yuanpei (1868–1940) – Educator
* Qu Hongji (1850–1918) – Politician

==Bureau of Translators==
Subordinated to the Hanlin Academy was the Bureau of Translators (). Founded by the Ming dynasty in 1407, after the first expedition of Zheng He to the Indian Ocean, the Bureau dealt with the memorials delivered by foreign ambassadors and trained foreign language specialists. It included departments for many languages such as the Jurchen, &quot;Tartar&quot; (Mongol), Korean, Ryukyuan, Japanese,
 Tibetan, &quot;Huihui&quot; (the &quot;Muslim&quot; language, Persian) Vietnamese and Burmese languages, as well as for the languages of the &quot;various barbarian tribes&quot; (&quot;Bai yi&quot; 百夷, i.e., Shan ethnic groups on China&#x27;s southwestern borders), &quot;Gaochang&quot; (people of Turfan, i.e. Old Uyghur language), and &quot;Xitian&quot; (西天; (Sanskrit, spoken in India). In 1511 and 1579 departments for the languages of &quot;Ba bai&quot; (八百; Lao) and Thai were added, respectively. A Malay language vocabulary (Manlajia Guan Yiyu) 滿剌加館譯語 (Words-list of Melaka Kingdom) for the Malay spoken in the Malacca Sultanate was compiled. A Cham language vocabulary 占城館 was created for the language spoken in the Champa Kingdom.

When the Qing dynasty revived the Ming &quot;Siyiguan&quot; 四夷館, the Manchus, who &quot;were sensitive to references to barbarians&quot;, changed the name from &quot;yi&quot; 夷 &quot;barbarian&quot; to &quot;yi&quot; 彝 &quot;Yi people&quot;, and changed the Shan exonym from &quot;Baiyi&quot; 百夷 &quot;hundred barbarians&quot; to &quot;Baiyi&quot; 百譯 &quot;hundred translations&quot;.

The later Tongwen Guan set up by the Qing dynasty for translating western languages was subordinated to the Zongli Yamen and not the Hanlin.

==1900 fire==

The Beijing Hanlin Academy and its library were severely damaged in a fire during the Siege of the International Legations in Peking (now known as Beijing) in 1900 by the Kansu Braves while fighting against the Eight-Nation Alliance, close to the British Legation as an intimidation tactic. On June 22-23, the fire spread to the academy:
The flames destroyed many ancient texts.

The academy operated continuously until its closure during the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.

<text>Attundaland (or the land of the eight [[Hundred (division)|hundred]]s) was the name given to the southeastern part of the present day province of Uppland, north of Stockholm. Its name refers to its role of providing 800 men and 32 ships for the leidang of the Swedish kings at Uppsala.

Snorri Sturluson relates that Tiundaland was the richest and most fertile region of Sweden. It was the seat of the Swedish kings at Uppsala and later the Swedish Archbishopric. All the Swedish lawspeakers were subordinate to the lawspeaker of Tiundaland.

The name of Attunda was revived as Attunda district court (Attunda tingsrätt) in April 2007, through the fusion of Sollentuna and Södra Roslags district courts. The seat of Attunda district court is situated in Sollentuna Municipality.

<doc id="1058652" wikidata="Q1754101" url="?curid=1058652" title="Still Cruisin'">
<text>Still Cruisin&#x27; is the twenty-sixth studio album by the Beach Boys, their thirty-fifth official album (counting compilations and live packages), and their last release of the 1980s. It is also the last album of new material released during a brief return to Capitol Records.

Released on August 28, 1989, the album was panned by critics, with AllMusic referring to the band&#x27;s sound by producer Terry Melcher as sounding &quot;like a professional &#x27;60s cover band.&quot; Despite the poor critical reception, the album was Certified Gold by RIAA in 1989 and has since gone on to be Certified Platinum for sales of 1,000,000 copies.

Despite its commercial success, &quot;Still Cruisin&quot; was left out of Capitol&#x27;s Beach Boys re-issue campaign in 2000 and 2001, along with their following album &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;. Its lead single &quot;Kokomo,&quot; however, has made subsequent appearances on compilation albums.

==Background==
After &quot;Kokomo&quot; (when released as a single from the &quot;Cocktail&quot; film soundtrack) gave the Beach Boys their first number one hit in the US since 1966&#x27;s &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; the band decided to put together an album of recent and classic songs. The classic songs included had been heard in recent films. The songs &quot;Somewhere Near Japan,&quot; &quot;Island Girl,&quot; and &quot;Still Cruisin&quot; were recorded for the album by the touring Beach Boys band as well as studio musicians and producer Terry Melcher. Due to his ongoing relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, Brian Wilson&#x27;s lone contribution to this album was &quot;In My Car&quot;, a song credited as being co-written by Landy and girlfriend Alexandra Morgan. However, as subsequent court actions have seen Landy&#x27;s name removed from other period songs, such as those on Wilson&#x27;s 1988 album, these credits may be negated.

&quot;Kokomo&quot; was a recent single, as was &quot;Wipe Out,&quot; a duet with American rap group the Fat Boys. (The song was originally to be recorded with Run-DMC, but Mike Love apparently struck a deal with the other group.) &quot;Make It Big&quot; was recorded for the film &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot;, and the remaining three songs - &quot;I Get Around,&quot; &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice,&quot; and &quot;California Girls&quot; – were the &quot;classic&quot; recordings, ones from the group&#x27;s earlier period, that had been used in recent films. The inclusion of these hits gave the album a more acceptable running time.

At least one song was recorded during or around the time of the sessions for this album but was not included. &quot;Happy Endings&quot; is a ballad which was a collaboration with Little Richard; it was produced by Terry Melcher and was (recorded in June and October 1987 and) released as a non-album single on November 3, 1987. (Its B-side was a live version of &quot;California Girls&quot;.) Also not included were &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll to the Rescue,&quot; &quot;Lady Liberty,&quot; and &quot;California Dreamin&quot; (all of which were released as singles in 1986), along with &quot;The Spirit of Rock and Roll&quot; (recorded between August 1986 and January 1987), a Brian Wilson composition included as the final song in the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary concert/TV special. &quot;The Spirit of Rock and Roll&quot; was not released. In addition, the 1988 remake of &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot; from the film &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; with the Everly Brothers was not included.

Mike Love said of the album: &quot;The theme of that album was to have been songs that have been in movies. It was basically a repackage. But then it got watered down with politics, meaning Brian&#x27;s Dr. Landy forcing a song called &quot;In My Car,&quot; which was never in a movie, and a song by [Al] Jardine, which ultimately ended up on the album, called &quot;Island Girl,&quot; which was never in a movie either. So to me the concept was a little bit diluted there politically.&quot;

Riding on the coattails of &quot;Kokomo,&quot; &quot;Still Cruisin&quot; went gold in the US and Austria and gave the Beach Boys their best chart showing since 1976. During Capitol&#x27;s Beach Boys re-issue campaign in 2000 and 2001 however, &quot;Still Cruisin&quot; was left behind and allowed to go out of print, and it has remained out of print ever since.

<doc id="1058655" wikidata="Q2652207" url="?curid=1058655" title="Herstmonceux Castle">
<text>Herstmonceux Castle is a brick-built castle, dating from the 15th century, near Herstmonceux, East Sussex, England. It is one of the oldest significant brick buildings still standing in England. The castle was renowned for being one of the first buildings to use that material in England, and was built using bricks taken from the local clay, by builders from Flanders. It dates from 1441. Construction began under the then-owner, Sir Roger Fiennes, and was continued after his death in 1449 by his son, Lord Dacre. The castle has been owned by Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, a Canadian university, since 1993.

The parks and gardens of Herstmonceux Castle and Place are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Other listed structures on the Herstmonceux estate include the Grade II listed walled garden to the north of the castle, and the Grade II* listed telescopes and workshops of the Herstmonceux Science Centre.

==History==
===Early history===
The first written evidence of the existence of the Herst settlement appears in William the Conqueror&#x27;s Domesday Book of 1086, which reports that one of William&#x27;s closest supporters granted tenancy of the manor at Herst to a man named &#x27;Wilbert&#x27;. By the end of the twelfth century, the family at the manor house at Herst had considerable status. Written accounts mention a lady called Idonea de Herst, who married a Norman nobleman named Ingelram de Monceux. Around this time, the manor began to be called the &quot;Herst of the Monceux&quot;, a name that eventually became Herstmonceux.

A descendant of the Monceux family, Roger Fiennes, was ultimately responsible for the construction of Herstmonceux Castle in the County of Sussex. Sir Roger was appointed Treasurer of the Household of Henry VI of England and needed a house fitting a man of his position, so construction of the castle on the site of the old manor house began in 1441. It was this position as treasurer which enabled him to afford the £3,800 construction of the original castle.
In 1541, Sir Thomas Fiennes, Lord Dacre, was tried for murder and robbery of the King&#x27;s deer after his poaching exploits on a neighboring estate resulted in the death of a gamekeeper. He was convicted and hanged as a commoner, and the Herstmonceux estate was temporarily confiscated by Henry VIII of England, but was restored to the Fiennes family during the reign of one of Henry&#x27;s children.

The profligacy of the 15th Baron Dacre, heir to the Fiennes family, forced him to sell in 1708 to George Naylor, a lawyer of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in London. Bethaia Naylor, who became the heiress of Herstmonceux on the death of her brother&#x27;s only daughter, married Francis Hare and produced a son, Francis, who inherited in turn, his mother&#x27;s property. The castle eventually came into the possession of Robert Hare-Naylor, who, upon the insistence of his second wife, Henrietta Henckell, followed the architect Samuel Wyatt&#x27;s advice to reduce the Castle to a picturesque ruin by demolishing the interior. Thomas Lennard, 17th Baron Dacre, was sufficiently exercised as to commission James Lambert of Lewes to record the building in 1776. The castle was dismantled in 1777 leaving the exterior walls standing and remained a ruin until the early 20th century.

=== 20th-century restoration ===
Radical restoration work was undertaken by Colonel Claude Lowther in 1913 to transform the ruined building into a residence and, based on a design by the architect, Walter Godfrey, this work was completed by Sir Paul Latham in 1933. The existing interiors largely date from that period, incorporating architectural antiques from England and France. The one major change in planning was the combination of the four internal courtyards into one large one. The restoration work, regarded as the apex of Godfrey&#x27;s architectural achievement, was described by the critic Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as executed &#x27;exemplarily&#x27;.

===Royal Greenwich Observatory===
The Royal Observatory was founded by King Charles II at Greenwich in 1675. Observing conditions at Greenwich deteriorated following the urban growth of London, and plans were made in the early 20th century to relocate the observatory to a rural location with clearer, darker skies. Herstmonceux Castle and estate were put up for sale by their private owners and were sold in 1946 to the Admiralty, which then operated the Royal Observatory on behalf of the British government. The relocation of the observatory took place over a decade, and was complete by 1957. A number of new buildings were erected in the castle grounds. The institution at Herstmonceux Castle was known as the Royal Greenwich Observatory, where it remained until 1988, when the observatory relocated to Cambridge.

Several of the telescopes remain but the largest telescope, the 100 inch (254 cm) aperture Isaac Newton Telescope was moved to La Palma, in the Canary Islands, in the 1970s. The estate houses the Equatorial Telescope Group, which is used as the Observatory Science Centre; a publicly accessible science museum, observatory and planetarium. The Observatory Science Centre has taken on the maintenance and upkeep of the grade II* listed observatory, which had fallen into disrepair before their tenancy. The empty dome for the Newton Telescope remains on this site and is a landmark, visible from afar.

===University Study Centre===
In 1992 Alfred Bader, an alumnus of Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, learned of the castle&#x27;s vacancy and offered to purchase the castle for his wife; she declined, joking that there would be &quot;too many rooms to clean&quot;. But in 1994, after intensive renovations, the Queen&#x27;s International Study Centre was opened. It hosts primarily undergraduate students studying arts, science, or commerce through the Canadian University Study Abroad Program (CUSAP), as well as graduate students studying Public International Law or International Business Law. Specialty summer programmes (May–June) including engineering (Global Project Management), archaeology, international health sciences, and law have become popular in recent years with students from both Queen&#x27;s and other universities. In late January 2009, the ISC was renamed the Bader International Study Centre. As part of the 25th anniversary celebrations, new science and innovation labs were opened on the campus to increase the ability for first year science-tracked students to attend. In 2022, the Bader International Study Centre was renamed Bader College. On 13 November 2023, in response to engineering investigations, the university suspended operations at Bader College and future admissions to Bader College programs until structural remediation activities can be completed. It is expected that these activities will take at least 18 months, with the scope of works required still under investigation.

===Historical retinue and events===
Herstmonceux Castle is associated with a retinue of historical re-enactment troops including archers, knights, and falconers, who fly their birds over the grounds. The castle is host to a large medieval weekend in August of each year, and is also hired out for weddings and weekend events.

== In popular culture ==
The castle was used for filming part of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, a 1990 BBC adaptation of the book (one of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;) by C. S. Lewis. The castle and gardens were used by comedians Reeves and Mortimer for one of their Mulligan and O&#x27;Hare sketches. In August 2002, The Coca-Cola Company rented the castle for use as part of a prize in a Harry Potter-themed sweepstakes—the castle served as &quot;Hogwarts&quot; in a day of Harry Potter-related activities for the sweepstakes winners. A &quot;painting&quot; of the castle was used as a magical cursed object in the U.S. television show &quot;Charmed&quot; – episode 2.3 &quot;The Painted World&quot;. Due to its suitable appearance, Herstmonceux Castle was a filming location for the series My Lady Jane.

<text>Michael Layne Turner (April 21, 1971 – June 27, 2008) was an American comics artist known for his work on &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;Fathom&quot;, &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;, &quot;Soulfire&quot;, and various covers for DC Comics and Marvel Comics. He was also the president of the entertainment company Aspen MLT.

==Early life==
Michael Turner was born in Crossville, Tennessee on April 21, 1971. He was a student at the University of Tennessee, and graduated from the International Performing Arts Academy after which he moved to San Diego, California, where he developed an interest in comics.

==Career==
Turner was discovered by Marc Silvestri at a convention and hired by Silvestri&#x27;s Top Cow Productions as an artist. He initially did background illustrations for Top Cow titles before co-creating &quot;Witchblade&quot;. In the summer of 1998 he debuted the creator-owned &quot;Fathom&quot;, having also worked on his new series &quot;Soulfire&quot;.

As well as an artist, Turner was an award-winning water skier, held an instructor-level red sash in martial arts, and was an avid video game player. In March 2000, Turner was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, a form of cancer, in the right pelvis. He was treated at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center with surgery in which he lost a hip, 40% of his pelvis, and three pounds of bone. The surgery was followed by nine months of radiation therapy.

Turner departed Top Cow in late 2002 to found his own comic book publishing company, Aspen MLT Inc. (where MLT stands for Michael Layne Turner), located in Santa Monica, with a studio in Marina del Rey, California. The release of comics from Aspen was delayed by a year-long lawsuit with Top Cow Productions over the rights to &quot;Fathom&quot; and over the rights to the unreleased titles &quot;Soulfire&quot; (initially called &quot;Dragonfly&quot;) and &quot;Ekos&quot;, both of which Turner had begun developing before leaving Top Cow and before his diagnosis of cancer. Aspen and Top Cow settled the lawsuit out of court in 2003.

In 2004 Turner contributed covers to various DC Comics titles, including &quot;The Flash&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;. He provided cover art and co-wrote the &quot;Godfall&quot; story arc that ran in the three main &quot;Superman&quot; titles in early 2004 and illustrated the six-issue Supergirl story arc in &quot;Superman/Batman.&quot; His creator-owned title &quot;Soulfire&quot; began publication in 2004 and &quot;Fathom&quot; resumed publication in that year as well, though this time with Aspen MLT rather than Top Cow.

On August 6, 2005, Marvel Comics announced the signing of Michael Turner to a work-for-hire deal for a six-issue project and covers. This would turn out to be at least the variant covers for the miniseries &quot;Civil War&quot; and the Wolverine ongoing series &quot;&quot;. In addition Turner had been announced as the artist on &quot;Ultimate Wolverine&quot;.

Turner created online comic adaptations for the NBC television series &quot;Heroes&quot;.

==Death and tribute==
Turner died June 27, 2008, at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, California, of complications from bone cancer. He is survived by his mother Grace Crick, his brother Jake Turner, and his fiancée Kelly Carmichael. &quot;Fathom&quot; vol. 3 #1, which was published on Wednesday, August 6, 2008, featured a tribute to Turner in the form of a stylized blue ribbon in the upper right-hand corner of its cover, and its first page was a memorial to him. Aspen MLT also published a trade paperback collection of writings from people who knew Turner, titled &quot;A Tribute to Michael Turner&quot;, which features a cover painted by Alex Ross. Volume #21 of &quot;The Boys&quot; included a page dedicated to Michael Turner as well.

<text>Ataxia–telangiectasia (AT or A–T), also referred to as ataxia–telangiectasia syndrome or Louis–Bar syndrome, is a rare, neurodegenerative disease causing severe disability. Ataxia refers to poor coordination and telangiectasia to small dilated blood vessels, both of which are hallmarks of the disease. A–T affects many parts of the body:
* It impairs certain areas of the brain including the cerebellum, causing difficulty with movement and coordination.
* It weakens the immune system, causing a predisposition to infection.
* It prevents the repair of broken DNA, increasing the risk of cancer.

Symptoms most often first appear in early childhood (the toddler stage) when children begin to sit or walk. Though they usually start walking at a normal age, they wobble or sway when walking, standing still, or sitting. In late pre-school and early school age, they develop difficulty moving their eyes in a natural manner from one place to the next (oculomotor apraxia). They develop slurred or distorted speech and swallowing problems. Some have an increased number of respiratory tract infections (ear infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A–T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A–T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.

==Causes==
A–T has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

A–T is caused by a defect in the &quot;ATM&quot; gene, named after this disease, which is involved in the recognition and repair of damaged DNA. Heterozygotes will not experience the characteristic symptoms but it has been reported they have higher risks of cancer and heart disease. The prevalence of A–T is estimated to be as high as 1 in 40,000 to as low as 1 in 300,000 people.

== Symptoms and signs ==
There is substantial variability in the severity of features of A–T among affected individuals, and at different ages. The following symptoms or problems are either common or important features of A–T:
* Ataxia (difficulty with control of movement) that is apparent early but worsens in school to pre-teen years
* Oculomotor apraxia (difficulty with coordination of head and eye movement when shifting gaze from one place to the next)
* Involuntary movements
* Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) over the white (sclera) of the eyes, making them appear bloodshot. These are not apparent in infancy and may first appear at age 5–8 years. Telangiectasia may also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin.
* Problems with infections, especially of the ears, sinuses and lungs
* Increased incidence of cancer (primarily, but not exclusively, lymphomas and leukemias)
* Delayed onset or incomplete pubertal development, and very early menopause
* Slowed rate of growth (weight and/or height)
* Drooling particularly in young children when they are tired or concentrating on activities
* Dysarthria (slurred, slow, or distorted speech)
* Diabetes in adolescence or later
* Premature changes in hair and skin

Many children are initially misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of A–T may not be made until the preschool years when the neurologic symptoms of impaired gait, hand coordination, speech, and eye movement appear or worsen, and the telangiectasia first appears. Because A–T is so rare, doctors may not be familiar with the symptoms, or methods of making a diagnosis. The late appearance of telangiectasia may be a barrier to the diagnosis. It may also take some time before doctors consider A–T as a possibility because of the early stability of symptoms and signs. Some patients have been diagnosed with A-T only in adulthood due to an attenuated form of the disease, and this has been correlated with the type of their gene mutation.

===Ataxia and other neurologic problems===
The first indications of A–T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, but may not improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A–T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around the beginning of their second decade, children with the more severe (&quot;classic&quot;) form of A–T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).

=== Telangiectasia ===

Prominent blood vessels (telangiectasia) over the white (sclera) of the eyes usually occur by the age of 5–8 years, but sometimes appear later or not at all. The absence of telangiectasia does not exclude the diagnosis of A–T. Potentially a cosmetic problem, the ocular telangiectasia does not bleed or itch, though they are sometimes misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis. It is their constant nature, not changing with time, weather, or emotion, that marks them as different from other visible blood vessels. Telangiectasia can also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin, especially the face and ears. They occur in the bladder as a late complication of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, have been seen deep inside the brain of older people with A–T, and occasionally arise in the liver and lungs.

=== Immune problems ===
About two-thirds of people with A–T have abnormalities of the immune system. The most common abnormalities are low levels of one or more classes of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, and IgG subclasses), not making antibodies in response to vaccines or infections, and having low numbers of lymphocytes (especially T-lymphocytes) in the blood. Some people have frequent infections of the upper (colds, sinus, and ear infections) and lower (bronchitis and pneumonia) respiratory tract. All children with A–T should have their immune systems evaluated to detect those with severe problems that require treatment to minimize the number or severity of infections. Some people with A–T need additional immunizations (especially with pneumonia and influenza vaccines), antibiotics to provide protection (prophylaxis) from infections, and/or infusions of immunoglobulins (gamma globulin). The need for these treatments should be determined by an expert in the field of immunodeficiency or infectious diseases.

=== Cancer ===
People with A–T have a highly increased incidence (approximately 25% lifetime risk) of cancers, particularly lymphomas and leukemia, but other cancers can occur.

Women who are A–T carriers (who have one mutated copy of the ATM gene) have approximately a two-fold increased risk for the development of breast cancer compared to the general population. This includes all mothers of A–T children and some female relatives. The current consensus is that special screening tests are not helpful, but all women should have routine cancer surveillance.

=== Skin ===
A–T can cause features of early aging such as premature graying of the hair. It can also cause vitiligo (an auto-immune disease causing loss of skin pigment resulting in a blotchy &quot;bleach-splashed&quot; look), and warts which can be extensive and recalcitrant to treatment. A small number of people develop a chronic inflammatory skin disease (granulomas).

=== Lung disease ===
Chronic lung disease develops in more than 25% of people with A–T.

Lung function tests (spirometry) should be performed at least annually in children old enough to perform them, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines given to eligible individuals, and sinopulmonary infections treated aggressively to limit the development of chronic lung disease.

=== Feeding, swallowing, and nutrition ===
Feeding and swallowing can become difficult for people with A–T as they age.

Involuntary movements may make feeding difficult or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It may be easier to finger feed than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork). For liquids, it is often easier to drink from a closed container with a straw than from an open cup. Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A–T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.

If swallowing problems (dysphagia) occur, they typically present during the second decade of life. Dysphagia is common because of the neurological changes that interfere with the coordination of mouth and pharynx (throat) movements that are needed for safe and efficient swallowing. Coordination problems involving the mouth may make chewing difficult and increase the duration of meals. Problems involving the pharynx may cause liquid, food, and saliva to be inhaled into the airway (aspiration). People with dysphagia may not cough when they aspirate (silent aspiration). Swallowing problems and especially swallowing problems with silent aspiration may cause lung problems due to the inability to cough and clear food and liquids from the airway.

; Warning signs of a swallowing problem
* Choking or coughing when eating or drinking
* Poor weight gain (during ages of expected growth) or weight loss at any age
* Excessive drooling
* Mealtimes longer than 40 – 45 minutes, on a regular basis
* Foods or drinks previously enjoyed are now refused or difficult
* Chewing problems
* Increase in the frequency or duration of breathing or respiratory problems
* Increase in lung infections

=== Eye and vision ===
* Most people develop telangiectasia (prominent blood vessels) in the membrane that covers the white part (sclera) of the eye.
* Vision (ability to see objects in focus) is normal.
* Control of eye movement is often impaired, affecting visual functions that require fast, accurate eye movements from point to point (e.g. reading).
* Eye misalignments (strabismus) are common but may be treatable.
* There may be difficulty in coordinating eye position and shaping the lens to see objects up close.

=== Orthopedics ===
Many individuals with A–T develop deformities of the feet that compound the difficulty they have with walking due to impaired coordination. Early treatment may slow the progression of this deformity. Bracing or surgical correction sometimes improves stability at the ankle sufficient to enable an individual to walk with support or bear weight during assisted standing transfers from one seat to another. Severe scoliosis is relatively uncommon, but probably does occur more often than in those without A–T. Spinal fusion is only rarely indicated.

== Genetics ==

A–T is caused by mutations in the ATM (ATM serine/threonine kinase or ataxia–telangiectasia mutated) gene, which was cloned in 1995. ATM is located on human chromosome 11 (11q22.3) and is made up of 69 exons spread across 150kb of genomic DNA.

The mode of inheritance for A–T is autosomal recessive. Each parent is a carrier, meaning that they have one normal copy of the A–T gene (ATM) and one copy that is mutated. A–T occurs if a child inherits the mutated A–T gene from each parent, so in a family with two carrier parents, there is 1 chance in 4 that a child born to the parents will have the disorder. Prenatal diagnosis (and carrier detection) can be carried out in families if the errors (mutation) in an affected child&#x27;s two ATM genes have been identified. The process of getting this done can be complicated and, as it requires time, should be arranged before conception.

Looking for mutations in the ATM gene of an unrelated person (for example, the spouse of a known A–T carrier) presents significant challenges. Genes often have variant spellings (polymorphisms) that do not affect function. In a gene as large as ATM, such variant spellings are likely to occur and doctors cannot always predict whether a specific variant will or will not cause disease. Genetic counseling can help family members of an A–T patient understand what can or cannot be tested, and how the test results should be interpreted.

Carriers of A–T, such as the parents of a person with A–T, have one mutated copy of the ATM gene and one normal copy. They are generally healthy, but there is an increased risk of breast cancer in women. This finding has been confirmed in a variety of different ways and is the subject of current research. Standard surveillance (including monthly breast self-exams and mammography at the usual schedule for age) is recommended, unless additional tests are indicated because the individual has other risk factors (e.g., family history of breast cancer).

Non-canonical variants such as the insertion of a retrotransposon, which had not been studied until a few years ago, actually appear to also have therapeutic implications in the development of Ataxia-telangiectasia. This issue was investigated by a recent study, which carried out NGS sequencing techniques and in vitro studies in a cohort of 235 AT patients from a Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital. The study showed that insertions of retroelements in the ATM gene are the cause of the development of the disease in 5.5% of patients and that insertions occur in non-coding regions in 92.3% of cases. 

This happens because insertions of retroelements, especially Alu elements, near an exon-intron boundary, cause changes in the splicing sites, resulting in the exclusion of an exon from the mature mRNA. This causes the appearance of premature stop codons, leading to degradation and loss-of-function of ATM. In addition, the insertion of the DUSP16 pseudogene into ATM can also result in loss of ATM function, as it leads to the appearance of a cryptic exon in mRNA due to the formation of new splicing acceptor and donor sites. This, again, generates premature stop codons.

== Pathophysiology ==
How loss of the ATM protein creates a multisystem disorder

A–T has been described as a genome instability syndrome, a DNA repair disorder, and a DNA damage response (DDR) syndrome. &quot;ATM&quot;, the gene responsible for this multi-system disorder, encodes a protein of the same name which coordinates the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Radiation therapy, chemotherapy that acts like radiation (radiomimetic drugs) and certain biochemical processes and metabolites can cause DSBs. When these breaks occur, ATM stops the cell from making new DNA (cell cycle arrest) and recruits and activates other proteins to repair the damage. Thus, ATM allows the cell to repair its DNA before the completion of cell division. If DNA damage is too severe, ATM will mediate the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) to eliminate the cell and prevent genomic instability.

=== Cancer and radiosensitivity ===
In the absence of the ATM protein, cell-cycle check-point regulation and programmed cell death in response to DSBs are defective. The result is genomic instability which can lead to the development of cancers.

Ionizing radiation (such as X-rays and gamma rays) and radiomimetic compounds induce DSBs which are unable to be repaired appropriately when ATM is absent. Consequently, such agents can prove especially cytotoxic to A–T cells and people with A–T. Therefore, X-ray exposure should be limited to times when it is medically necessary, as exposing an A–T patient to ionizing radiation can damage cells in such a way that the body cannot repair them. The cells can cope normally with other forms of radiation, such as ultraviolet light, so there is no need for special precautions from sunlight exposure.

=== Delayed pubertal development (gonadal dysgenesis) ===
Infertility is often described as a characteristic of A–T. Whereas this is certainly the case for the mouse model of A–T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as gonadal atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.

=== Immune system defects and immune-related cancers ===

As lymphocytes develop from stem cells in the bone marrow into mature lymphocytes in the periphery, they rearrange special segments of their DNA [V(D)J recombination process]. This process requires them to make DSBs, which are difficult to repair in the absence of ATM. As a result, most people with A–T have reduced numbers of lymphocytes and some impairment of lymphocyte function (such as an impaired ability to make antibodies in response to vaccines or infections). In addition, broken pieces of DNA in chromosomes involved in the above-mentioned rearrangements tend to recombine with other genes (translocation), making the cells prone to the development of cancer (lymphoma and leukemia).

=== Progeric changes ===
Cells from people with A–T demonstrate genomic instability, slow growth and premature senescence in culture, shortened telomeres, and an ongoing, low-level stress response. These factors may contribute to the progeric (signs of early aging) changes of skin and hair sometimes observed in people with A–T. For example, DNA damage and genomic instability cause melanocyte stem cell (MSC) differentiation which produces graying. Thus, ATM may be a &quot;stemness checkpoint&quot; protecting against MSC differentiation and premature graying of the hair.

=== Telangiectasia ===
The cause of telangiectasia or dilated blood vessels in the absence of the ATM protein is not yet known.

=== Increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels ===
Approximately 95% of people with A–T have elevated serum AFP levels after the age of two, and measured levels of AFP appear to increase slowly over time. AFP levels are very high in the newborn, and normally descend to adult levels over the first year to 18 months. The reason why individuals with A–T have elevated levels of AFP is not yet known.

=== Neurodegeneration ===
A–T is one of several DNA repair disorders that result in neurological abnormalities or degeneration. Arguably some of the most devastating symptoms of A–T are a result of progressive cerebellar degeneration, characterized by the loss of Purkinje cells and, to a lesser extent, granule cells (located exclusively in the cerebellum). The cause of this cell loss is unknown, though many hypotheses have been proposed based on experiments performed both in cell culture and in the mouse model of A–T. Current hypotheses explaining the neurodegeneration associated with A–T include the following:
* Defective DNA damage response in neurons which can lead to
** Failed clearance of genomically damaged neurons during development
** Transcription stress and abortive transcription including topoisomerase 1 cleavage complex (TOP1cc) dependent lesions
** Aneuploidy
* Defective response to oxidative stress characterized by elevated ROS and altered cellular metabolism
* Mitochondrial dysfunction
* Defects in neuronal function:
** Inappropriate cell cycle re-entry of post-mitotic (mature) neurons
** Synaptic/vesicular dysregulation
** HDAC4 dysregulation
** Histone hypermethylation and altered epigenetics
* Altered protein turnover
These hypotheses may not be mutually exclusive and more than one of these mechanisms may underlie neuronal cell death when there is an absence or deficiency of ATM. Further, cerebellar damage and loss of Purkinje and granule cells do not explain all of the neurologic abnormalities seen in people with A–T. The effects of ATM deficiency on the other areas of the brain outside of the cerebellum are being actively investigated.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of A–T is usually suspected by the combination of neurologic clinical features (ataxia, abnormal control of eye movement, and postural instability) with telangiectasia and sometimes increased infections, and confirmed by specific laboratory abnormalities (elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, increased chromosomal breakage or cell death of white blood cells after exposure to X-rays, absence of ATM protein in white blood cells, or mutations in each of the person&#x27;s ATM genes).

A variety of laboratory abnormalities occur in most people with A–T, allowing for a tentative diagnosis to be made in the presence of typical clinical features. Not all abnormalities are seen in all patients. These abnormalities include:
* Elevated and slowly increasing alpha-fetoprotein levels in serum after 2 years of age
* Immunodeficiency with low levels of immunoglobulins (especially IgA, IgM, IgG, and IgG subclasses) and low number of lymphocytes in the blood
* Chromosomal instability (broken pieces of chromosomes)
* Increased sensitivity of cells to x-ray exposure (cells die or develop even more breaks and other damage to chromosomes)
* Cerebellar atrophy on MRI scan

The diagnosis can be confirmed in the laboratory by finding an absence or deficiency of the ATM protein in cultured blood cells, an absence or deficiency of ATM function (kinase assay), or mutations in both copies of the cell&#x27;s ATM gene. These more specialized tests are not always needed but are particularly helpful if a child&#x27;s symptoms are atypical.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
There are several other disorders with similar symptoms or laboratory features that physicians may consider when diagnosing A–T. The three most common disorders that are sometimes confused with A–T are:
* Cerebral palsy
* Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia
* Cogan oculomotor apraxia
Each of these can be distinguished from A–T by the neurologic exam and clinical history.

Cerebral palsy (CP) describes a non-progressive disorder of motor function stemming from malformation or early damage to the brain. CP can manifest in many ways, given the different manner in which the brain can be damaged; in common to all forms is the emergence of signs and symptoms of impairment as the child develops. However, milestones that have been accomplished and neurologic functions that have developed do not deteriorate in CP as they often do in children with A–T in the late pre-school years. Most children with ataxia caused by CP do not begin to walk at a normal age, whereas most children with A–T start to walk at a normal age even though they often &quot;wobble&quot; from the start. Pure ataxia is a rare manifestation of early brain damage or malformation, however, and the possibility of an occult genetic disorder of the brain should be considered and sought for those in whom ataxia is the chief manifestation of CP. Children with ataxic CP will not manifest the laboratory abnormalities associated with A–T.

Cogan oculomotor apraxia is a rare disorder of development. Affected children have difficulty moving their eyes only to a new visual target, so they will turn their heads past the target to &quot;drag&quot; their eyes to the new object of interest, then turn their heads back. This tendency becomes evident in late infancy and toddler years and mostly improves with time. This contrasts with the oculomotor difficulties evident in children with A–T, which are not evident in early childhood but emerge over time. Cogan&#x27;s oculomotor apraxia is generally an isolated problem or may be associated with a broader developmental delay.

Friedreich ataxia (FA) is the most common genetic cause of ataxia in children. Like A–T, FA is a recessive disease, appearing in families without a history of the disorder. FA is caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene, most often an expansion of a naturally occurring repetition of the three nucleotide bases GAA from the usual 5–33 repetitions of this trinucleotide sequence to greater than 65 repeats on each chromosome. Most often the ataxia appears between 10 and 15 years of age and differs from A–T by the absence of telangiectasia and oculomotor apraxia, a normal alpha fetoprotein, and the frequent presence of scoliosis, absent tendon reflexes, and abnormal features on the EKG. Individuals with FA manifest difficulty standing in one place which is much enhanced by the closure of the eyes (Romberg sign) that is not so apparent in those with A–T – even though those with A–T may have greater difficulty standing in one place with their eyes open.

Other rare disorders can be confused with A–T, either because of similar clinical features, a similarity of some laboratory features, or both. These include:
* Ataxia–oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1)
* Ataxia–oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2 also known as SCAR1)
* Ataxia–telangiectasia–like disorder (ATLD)
* Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)

Ataxia–oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is an autosomal recessive disorder similar to A–T in manifesting increasing problems with coordination and oculomotor apraxia, often at a similar age to those having A–T. It is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the protein aprataxin. Affected individuals differ from those with A–T by the early appearance of peripheral neuropathy, early in their course manifest difficulty with the initiation of gaze shifts, and the absence of ocular telangiectasia, but laboratory features are of key importance in the differentiation of the two. Individuals with AOA1 have a normal AFP, normal measures of immune function, and after 10–15 years have low serum levels of albumin. Genetic testing of the aprataxin gene can confirm the diagnosis. There is no enhanced risk for cancer.

Ataxia–oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is an autosomal recessive disorder also similar to A–T in manifesting increasing problems with coordination and peripheral neuropathy, but oculomotor apraxia is present in only half of the affected individuals. Ocular telangiectasia does not develop. Laboratory abnormalities of AOA2 are like A–T, and unlike AOA1, in having an elevated serum AFP level, but like AOA1 and unlike A–T in having normal markers of immune function. Genetic testing of the senataxin gene (SETX) can confirm the diagnosis. There is no enhanced risk for cancer.

Ataxia–telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) is an extremely rare condition, caused by mutation in the hMre11 gene, that could be considered in the differential diagnosis of A–T. Patients with ATLD are very similar to those with A–T in showing progressive cerebellar ataxia, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, and genomic instability. Those rare individuals with ATLD who are well described differ from those with A–T by the absence of telangiectasia, normal immunoglobulin levels, a later onset, and a slower progression of the symptoms. Because of its rarity, it is not yet known whether or not ATLD carries an increased risk of developing cancer. Because those mutations of Mre11 that severely impair the MRE11 protein are incompatible with life, individuals with ATLD all have some partial function of the Mre11 protein, and hence likely all have their own levels of disease severity.

Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare genetic disorder that has similar chromosomal instability to that seen in people with A–T, but the problems experienced are quite different. Children with NBS have significant microcephaly, a distinct facial appearance, short stature, and moderate cognitive impairment, but do not experience any neurologic deterioration over time. Like those with A–T, children with NBS have enhanced sensitivity to radiation, disposition to lymphoma and leukemia, and some laboratory measures of impaired immune function, but do not have ocular telangiectasia or an elevated level of AFP.

The proteins expressed by the hMre11 (defective in ATLD) and Nbs1 (defective in NBS) genes exist in the cell as a complex, along with a third protein expressed by the hRad50 gene. This complex, known as the MRN complex, plays an important role in DNA damage repair and signaling and is required to recruit ATM to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. Mre11 and Nbs1 are also targets for phosphorylation by the ATM kinase. Thus, the similarity of the three diseases can be explained in part by the fact that the protein products of the three genes mutated in these disorders interact in common pathways in the cell.

Differentiation of these disorders is often possible with clinical features and selected laboratory tests. In cases where the distinction is unclear, clinical laboratories can identify genetic abnormalities of ATM, aprataxin, and senataxin, and specialty centers can identify abnormality of the proteins of potentially responsible genes, such as ATM, MRE11, nibrin, TDP1, aprataxin, and senataxin as well as other proteins important to ATM function such as ATR, DNA-PK, and RAD50.

== Management ==

=== Ataxia and other neurologic problems ===
There is no treatment known to slow or stop the progression of the neurologic problems.

=== Immune problems ===
All individuals with A–T should have at least one comprehensive immunologic evaluation that measures the number and type of lymphocytes in the blood (T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes), the levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and antibody responses to T-dependent (e.g., tetanus, Hemophilus influenzae b) and T-independent (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide) vaccines. For the most part, the pattern of immunodeficiency seen in an A–T patient early in life (by age five) will be the same pattern seen throughout the lifetime of that individual. Therefore, the tests need not be repeated unless that individual develops more problems with infection. Problems with immunity sometimes can be overcome by immunization. Vaccines against common bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Hemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, and influenza virus (the &quot;flu&quot;) are commercially available and often help to boost antibody responses, even in individuals with low immunoglobulin levels. If the vaccines do not work and the patient continues to have problems with infections, gamma globulin therapy (IV or subcutaneous infusions of antibodies collected from normal individuals) may be of benefit. A small number of people with A–T develop an abnormality in which one or more types of immunoglobulin are increased far beyond the normal range. In a few cases, the immunoglobulin levels can be increased so much that the blood becomes thick and does not flow properly. Therapy for this problem must be tailored to the specific abnormality found and its severity.

If an individual patient&#x27;s susceptibility to infection increases, it is important to reassess immune function in case deterioration has occurred and a new therapy is indicated. If infections are occurring in the lungs, it is also important to investigate the possibility of dysfunctional swallowing with aspiration into the lungs (see above sections under Symptoms: Lung Disease and Symptoms: Feeding, Swallowing and Nutrition.)

Most people with A–T have low lymphocyte counts in the blood. This problem seems to be relatively stable with age, but a rare number of people do have progressively decreasing lymphocyte counts as they get older. In the general population, very low lymphocyte counts are associated with an increased risk for infection. Such individuals develop complications from live viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox), chronic or severe viral infections, yeast infections of the skin and vagina, and opportunistic infections (such as pneumocystis pneumonia). Although lymphocyte counts are often as low in people with A–T, they seldom have problems with opportunistic infections. (The one exception to that rule is that problems with chronic or recurrent warts are common.) The number and function of T-lymphocytes should be re-evaluated if a person with A–T is treated with corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone for longer than a few weeks or is treated with chemotherapy for cancer. If lymphocyte counts are low in people taking those types of drugs, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended to prevent opportunistic infections.

If the tests show significant abnormalities of the immune system, a specialist in immunodeficiency or infectious diseases will be able to discuss various treatment options. The absence of immunoglobulin or antibody responses to the vaccine can be treated with replacement gamma globulin infusions or can be managed with prophylactic antibiotics and minimized exposure to infection. If antibody function is normal, all routine childhood immunizations including live viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) should be given. In addition, several &quot;special&quot; vaccines (that is, licensed but not routine for otherwise healthy children and young adults) should be given to decrease the risk that an A–T patient will develop lung infections. The patient and all household members should receive the influenza (flu) vaccine every fall. People with A–T who are less than two years old should receive three doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) given at two-month intervals. People older than two years who have not previously been immunized with Prevnar should receive two doses of Prevnar. At least 6 months after the last Prevnar has been given and after the child is at least two years old, the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine should be administered. Immunization with the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine should be repeated approximately every five years after the first dose.

In people with A–T who have low levels of IgA, further testing should be performed to determine whether the IgA level is low or completely absent. If absent, there is a slightly increased risk of a transfusion reaction. &quot;Medical Alert&quot; bracelets are not necessary, but the family and primary physician should be aware that if there is elective surgery requiring red cell transfusion, the cells should be washed to decrease the risk of an allergic reaction.

People with A–T also have an increased risk of developing autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. This risk is probably a secondary effect of their immunodeficiency and not a direct effect of the lack of ATM protein. The most common examples of such disorders in A–T include immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), several forms of arthritis, and vitiligo.

=== Lung disease ===
Recurrent sinus and lung infections can lead to the development of chronic lung disease. Such infections should be treated with appropriate antibiotics to prevent and limit lung injury. Administration of antibiotics should be considered when children and adults have prolonged respiratory symptoms (greater than 7 days), even following what was presumed to have been a viral infection. To help prevent respiratory illnesses from common respiratory pathogens, annual influenza vaccinations should be given and pneumococcal vaccines should be administered when appropriate. Antibiotic treatment should also be considered in children with chronic coughs that are productive of mucous, those who do not respond to aggressive pulmonary clearance techniques, and children with mucopurulent secretions from the sinuses or chest. A wet cough can also be associated with chronic aspiration which should be ruled out through proper diagnostic studies, however, aspiration and respiratory infections are not necessarily exclusive of each other. In children and adults with bronchiectasis, chronic antibiotic therapy should be considered to slow chronic lung disease progression.

Culturing of the sinuses may be needed to direct antibiotic therapy. This can be done by an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist. In addition, diagnostic bronchoscopy may be necessary in people who have recurrent pneumonia, especially those who do not respond or respond incompletely to a course of antibiotics.

Clearance of bronchial secretions is essential for good pulmonary health and can help limit injury from acute and chronic lung infections. Children and adults with increased bronchial secretions can benefit from routine chest therapy using the manual method, an acapella device, or a chest physiotherapy vest. Chest physiotherapy can help bring up mucous from the lower bronchial tree, however, an adequate cough is needed to remove secretions. In people who have decreased lung reserve and a weak cough, the use of an insufflator-exsufflator (cough-assist) device may be useful as maintenance therapy or during acute respiratory illnesses to help remove bronchial secretions from the upper airways. Evaluation by a pulmonology specialist, however, should first be done to properly assess patient suitability.

Children and adults with chronic dry cough, increased work of breathing (fast respiratory rate, shortness of breath at rest or with activities) and absence of an infectious process to explain respiratory symptoms should be evaluated for interstitial lung disease or another intrapulmonary process. Evaluation by a Pulmonologist and a CT scan of the chest should be considered in individuals with symptoms of interstitial lung disease or to rule out other non-infectious pulmonary processes. People diagnosed with interstitial lung disease may benefit from systemic steroids.

=== Feeding, swallowing, and nutrition ===
Oral intake may be aided by teaching persons with A–T how to drink, chew, and swallow more safely. The propriety of treatments for swallowing problems should be determined following evaluation by an expert in the field of speech-language pathology. Dieticians may help treat nutrition problems by recommending dietary modifications, including high-calorie foods or food supplements.

A feeding (gastrostomy) tube is recommended when any of the following occur:
* A child cannot eat enough to grow or a person of any age cannot eat enough to maintain weight;
* Aspiration is problematic;
* Mealtimes are stressful or too long, interfering with other activities.

=== Education and socialization ===
Most children with A–T have difficulty in school because of a delay in response time to visual, verbal, or other cues, slurred and quiet speech (dysarthria), abnormalities of eye control (oculomotor apraxia), and impaired fine motor control. Despite these problems, children with A–T often enjoy school if proper accommodations for their disability can be made. The decision about the need for special education classes or extra help in regular classes is highly influenced by the local resources available. Decisions about proper educational placement should be revisited as often as circumstances warrant. Despite their many neurologic impairments, most individuals with A–T are very socially aware and socially skilled and thus benefit from sustained peer relationships developed at school. Some individuals can function quite well despite their disabilities and a few have graduated from community colleges.

Many of the problems encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to &quot;input and output&quot; issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control make it difficult for people with A–T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase in the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It is important to recognize that intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A–T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A–T are often very conscious of their appearance and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.

====General recommendations====
* All children with A–T need special attention to the barriers they experience in school. In the United States, this takes the form of a formal IEP (Individualized Education Program).
* Children with A–T tend to be excellent problem solvers. Their involvement in how to best perform tasks should be encouraged.
* Speech-language pathologists may facilitate communication skills that enable persons with A–T to get their messages across (using keywords vs. complete sentences) and teach strategies to decrease frustration associated with the increased time needed to respond to questions (e.g., holding up a hand and informing others about the need to allow more time for responses). Rarely helpful are traditional speech therapies that focus on the production of specific sounds and strengthening of the lip and tongue muscles.
* Classroom aides may be appropriate, especially to help with scribing, transportation through the school, mealtimes, and toileting. The impact of an aide on peer relationships should be monitored carefully.
* Physical therapy is useful for maintaining strength and general cardiovascular health. Horseback therapy and exercises in a swimming pool are often well tolerated and fun for people with A–T. However, no amount of practice will slow cerebellar degeneration or improve neurologic function. Exercise to the point of exhaustion should be avoided.
* Hearing is normal throughout life. Books on tape may be a useful adjunct to traditional school materials.
* Early use of computers (preschool) with word completion software should be encouraged.
* Practicing coordination (e.g. balance beam or cursive writing exercises) is not helpful.
* Occupational therapy helps manage daily living skills.
* Allow rest time, shortened days, reduced class schedule, reduced homework, and modified tests as necessary.
* Like all children, those with A–T need to have goals to experience the satisfaction of making progress.
* Social interactions with peers are important and should be taken into consideration for class placement. For everyone long-term peer relationships can be the most rewarding part of life; for those with A–T establishing these connections in school years can be helpful.

=== Treatment ===
No curative medication has been approved for the treatment of inherited cerebellar ataxias, including Ataxia-Telangiectasia.

Nonetheless, a new study that identified retroelement insertions in ATM as one of the causes for ATM loss-of-function in A-T patients has also suggested that antisense oligonucleotides might be a viable therapy. In this novel research article, antisense oligonucleotides corrected the mis-splicing caused by retroelement insertion of DUSP16 pseudogene in ATM &quot;in vitro&quot;, restoring the level of normal ATM transcripts. 

==== N-Acetyl-Leucine ====
N-Acetyl-Leucine is an orally administered, modified amino acid that is being developed as a novel treatment for multiple rare and common neurological disorders by IntraBio Inc (Oxford, United Kingdom).

N-Acetyl-Leucine has been granted multiple orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of various genetic diseases, including Ataxia-Telangiectasia. N-Acetyl-Leucine has also been granted Orphan Drug Designations in the US and EU for related inherited cerebellar ataxias, such as Spinocerebellar Ataxias. U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Published case series studies have demonstrated the positive clinical benefit of treatment with N-Acetyl-Leucine various inherited cerebellar ataxias.

A multinational clinical trial investigating N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment Ataxia-Telangiectasia began in 2019.

IntraBio is also conducting two parallel clinical trials with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment Niemann-Pick disease type C and GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff Disease) Future opportunities to develop N-Acetyl-Leucine include Lewy Body Dementia, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Restless Leg Syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, and Migraine.

== Prognosis ==
Median survival in two large cohort studies was 25 and 19 years of age, with a wide range.

Life expectancy does not correlate well with the severity of neurological impairment.

== Epidemiology ==
Individuals of all races and ethnicities are affected equally. The incidence worldwide is estimated to be between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 100,000 people.

== Research directions ==
An open-label Phase II clinical trial studying the use of red blood cells (erythrocytes) loaded with dexamethasone sodium phosphate found that this treatment improved symptoms and appeared to be well tolerated. This treatment uses a unique delivery system for medication by using the patient&#x27;s own red blood cells as the delivery vehicle for the drug.

==History==
Denise Louis-Bar, from whom it received the name Louis-Bar Syndrome, first described the condition in 1941.

<text>The Christian Historical Union (, CHU) was a Protestant Christian democratic political party in the Netherlands. The CHU is one of the predecessors of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), into which it merged in September 1980.

== History ==
=== 1879-1908: Predecessor parties ===
An important inspiration for the CHU was Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer (1801-1876), who coined the terms &#x27;anti-revolutionary&#x27; and &#x27;Christian-historical&#x27;. In 1879, the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) was founded as mass party for Protestants led by Abraham Kuyper. Unlike previous anti-revolutionary politicians such as Groen van Prinsterer, Kuyper was convinced God&#x27;s will could be translated to politics. As part of Kuyper&#x27;s antithesis, the ARP worked together with Roman Catholics as the coalition, with the goal of equal funding for religious schools (the School struggle). After the 1888 election and 1888 formation, this tactic resulted in the Mackay cabinet, comprising Anti-revolutionaries and Catholics. This cabinet managed to partially fund religious schools.
Meanwhile, divisions emerged within the ARP, becoming increasingly clear over time. Many anti-revolutionary parliamentarians valued their independence from their electorate, leading to the formation of two distinct factions within the parliamentary group. The 1886 Dutch Reformed Church split, instigated by Kuyper, resulted in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1892. Some viewed the collaboration with the Catholics as a betrayal of the nation&#x27;s Protestant identity. The direct cause of a break was a proposal in 1892 by liberal minister Johannes Tak van Poortvliet to expand the suffrage. While Kuyper supported this, conservative parliamentarians led by Alexander de Savornin Lohman opposed it. After the 1894 election, they formed their own parliamentary group, mostly comprising members with an aristocratic background and who had not followed Kuyper in the Dutch Reformed Church split. When reunification turned out to be impossible, they formed the Free Anti Revolutionary Party (VAR) in 1897.

Around the same time, two other Reformed parties had been founded. In 1896, the Christian Historical Voters&#x27; League (CHP) was founded and in 1898 the Frisian League. Both rejected the secular state, emphasizing respectively the Protestant character and Dutch Reformed character of the nation. In 1903, the VAR merged with the Christian Historical Voters&#x27; League to form the Christian Historical Party. In 1908, the Christian Historical Party merged with the Frisian League to found the Christian Historical Union. The two merges resulted in a party manifesto, which was a combination of the constitutional views of the VAR and religious views of the other two, although it would emphasize the broader Protestant character the CHP advocated. Under influence of the Frisian League, it became more of a testimonial party. Later in 1912, members of the small National Historical Party also joined the CHU.

=== 1908–1918: electoral districts ===
Between 1908 and 1913, the CHU supported a minority confessional cabinet of ARP and the Catholic General League. In the 1909 election the party won 10 seats, two more than the CHP and Frisian League had won in 1905. In the 1913 election the party stayed stable. Between 1913 and 1918 the country was governed by an extra parliamentary cabinet formed by liberals. Its main goal was to implement a constitutional reform combining both male universal suffrage and equal payment for religious schools. At the end of the cabinets term, two CHU ministers joined the cabinet, as they were relatively neutral politicians.

=== 1918-1945 ===
In the 1918 elections, in which male universal suffrage and proportional representation were used for the first time, the party lost three seats. Together the ARP, CHU and the Catholic RKSP won fifty seats. The CHU started to cooperate fully in the confessional coalition. They formed a cabinet led by the Catholic Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck. The CHU provided only one minister (De Visser became minister of Education, Arts and Sciences) and two non-partisan sympathisers of the CHU were appointed. During the cabinet&#x27;s term one CHU member, Dirk Jan de Geer and another CHU sympathiser were appointed as ministers, while the two CHU-sympathisers stepped down. In the 1922 election, the party won four seats. The cabinet of Ruys de Beerenbrouck continued to govern; the CHU supplied two ministers and one non-partisan CHU-sympathiser is appointed. During the term one CHU minister, minister of finance De Geer, stepped down, after the budget of the ministry of the Navy had been rejected. In the 1925 election the party remained stable at 11 seats. A party which was closely related to the CHU, the HGS, an orthodox version of the CHU, also won one seat. Another RKSP-ARP-CHU cabinet was formed, now led by Hendrikus Colijn; the CHU supplied two ministers. In 1925, the cabinet fell prematurely because of a motion supported by the CHU parliamentary party. Each year the anti-Papist Reformed Political Party would propose a motion to remove the Dutch representative at the Holy See, (a symbolic motion to show their opposition to the Pope) which was supported by the CHU. In 1925, the left-liberal Free-thinking Democratic League and socialist Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party supported this motion because they saw it as an opportunity to bring about the downfall of the cabinet and form a progressive coalition after the election. After lengthy formation talks an extra-parliamentary cabinet was formed, led by De Geer of the CHU, with one other CHU member appointed and one further CHU member joining during the cabinet&#x27;s lifetime. De Geer was chosen because he was a reliable administrator and a less divisive figure. In the 1929 election the party remained stable at 11 seats. It cooperated in a new coalition cabinet led by Ruys de Beerenbrouck, supplying two ministers, with one CHU-sympathiser also serving as a minister.

After the 1933 election, in which the party lost one seat, another coalition cabinet led by Colijn was formed, which was joined by members of the liberal Free-thinking Democratic League and the Liberal State Party. The CHU supplied only one minister and a further CHU member was appointed minister during the cabinet&#x27;s term, who left after a cabinet crisis. During the 1930s, a group of the party&#x27;s younger members, including Piet Lieftinck began to develop support for state intervention in the economy and form a Christian basis for this intervention on basis of the work of the theologian Karl Barth. In the 1937 election the party lost two additional seats, leaving eight. The party continued to govern in an ARP-RKSP-CHU coalition. In 1939, a national cabinet was formed with the SDAP and the three confessional parties. De Geer, as a reliable, respected administrator, led this cabinet. During World War II, De Geer&#x27;s position became less tenable, as he attempted to negotiate a peace with the Germans against the will of the government. When the Dutch government went into exile he was replaced by ARP-member Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy and the CHU provided one minister in these cabinets in exile.

===1945–1980===
After the Second World War, prominent CHU politicians wanted to end the pillarisation of Dutch politics. Some wanted to unite the CHU with the ARP, others, like Piet Lieftinck, joined the new social democratic Labour Party (PvdA).

Between 1945 and 1948, the CHU was marginalised politically as the re-founded Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) rejected cooperation with the confessional parties in favour of cooperation with the PvdA. Some prominent progressive CHU-members left the CHU to join this new PvdA. It was kept out of the progressive Schermerhorn–Drees cabinet. In the 1946 elections, it kept its eight seats, which it also had before the war. The CHU was also kept out of the first Beel cabinet which also just consisted of the KVP and PvdA.

After the 1948 election (in which the party won one seat), it was invited to join the cabinet again. It joined the broad basis cabinet Drees–Van Schaik cabinet which combined the KVP, PvdA, CHU and the conservative liberal VVD, that is every major party except for the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the Anti-Revolutionary Party. These parties were excluded because they opposed the major reforms the cabinets were implementing, including the welfare state, in the case of the CPN, and the decolonisation of the Dutch East Indies in the case of the ARP. The CHU endorsed both these policies, creating considerable conflict internally. The CHU parliamentary group in the Senate voted for the independence of Indonesia. The CHU provided one minister, which was expanded to two after a 1951 cabinet crisis. After the 1952 election, a new cabinet was formed and the VVD was replaced by the ARP, while the CHU retained two ministers. In the 1956 election, the party retained the same percentage of vote, but due to the expansion of parliament it gets 13 seats (out of 150). A new cabinet was formed with the same composition and the CHU retained its two ministers. In 1959 the cabinet fell prematurely. A caretaker cabinet was formed by ARP, KVP and CHU.
After the 1959 election (in which the party lost one seat), the De Quay cabinet is formed by KVP, ARP, CHU and VVD. The CHU still supplied two ministers. After the 1963 elections, in which the CHU gained one seat, the cabinet continued. In 1965 this cabinet fell, and a new cabinet was formed, without the CHU and the VVD, but with the PvdA. This cabinet fell after one year. In the 1967 election campaign, the ARP, CHU and KVP declared that they would continue to govern together. The CHU lost one seat but still supplied two ministers in the new KVP-ARP-CHU-VVD coalition De Jong cabinet. During this period the differences between the ARP and CHU became more pronounced, with the ARP becoming more progressive and the CHU remaining more conservative. In the 1971 election the party lost 3 seats. It joined a coalition cabinet of the same parties, now joined by the moderate Democratic Socialists &#x27;70, which broke away from the PvdA. The cabinet fell after one year. In the 1972 election campaign, the CHU lost three seats, and was left with seven. Furthermore, CHU was blocked from the newly formed cabinet by the PvdA and its allies, which cooperated with the KVP and ARP.
Meanwhile, a process of merger had started between the KVP, ARP and CHU, under pressure of poor election results. In 1974, they founded a federation called the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). In the 1977 election, they campaigned together under the name of the CDA.

The power of the CHU current within the CDA is relatively small. Although there are some prominent CDA politicians with a background in the CHU, the better organised KVP and ARP are far stronger currents within the party.

==Name==
The CHU derived its name &quot;Christian Historical Union&quot; from its combination of conservatism, the orientation to that which has historically grown with Protestant Christianity. The label &quot;conservative&quot; was already taken by a parliamentary group of monarchists and colonialists, who fell from favour during the late 19th century. In its early years, the terms anti-revolutionary and Christian-historical were used interchangeably. With the split between the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the CHU the terms began to gain their own separate meanings. Furthermore, the party styled itself a loose union of individual MPs and municipal caucuses and therefore used the term Union instead of party.

==Ideology and issues==
The CHU lacked a coherent political ideology as it was formed by politicians who emphasised their own independent position. Furthermore, many times it served as the counterpart of the ARP:
* Between 1908 and 1918, the party served as the more conservative of the two main Protestant parties. It was more anti-papal than the ARP, which was more oriented towards cooperation with Catholics. It was also more sceptical about universal suffrage.
* In the period between 1918 and 1940, the differences between the ARP and CHU were mainly religious, with parties advocating similar policies, like a strong defence and fiscal conservatism. With the ARP representing the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the CHU conservative parts of the Dutch Reformed Church and other non-aligned churches. Arguably, the CHU inclined to be “both more sophisticated and (...) more dogmatic” than the ARP
* Between 1945 and 1960, the differences between the ARP and the CHU were focused on the issue of decolonisation of the Dutch East Indies: while the ARP was vehemently against this, the CHU was pragmatic about the issue. It presented itself as a &quot;centre party&quot; and was described in the media as such.
* In the 1960s and 1970s, the ARP became more progressive, while the CHU began to emphasise its conservatism. However it is interesting that the CHU did not embrace a specific political label as was emphasised in a rapport published in 1967 that described the party as being neither conservative, progressive, right-wing or left-wing, but a political party that wanted to serve all the people. The left wing of the party wanted the party to become a progressive party and close co-operation with the Labour Party and the other Christian Democratic parties; however, the majority of the party wanted to continue the centrist course.

Generally the political course of the party can be seen as (soft) conservative and Christian democratic. It saw the government as the servant of God and emphasised the special role of the Netherlands, with its history of Protestantism. The CHU had relatively constant positions on several issues:
* The party was conservative in social and ethical matters, rejecting divorce and protecting the position of religious schools. At the same time they supported public schools, believing they must be based on Christian principles. After the Second World War, it embraced a more socially progressive stand and supported the creation of a welfare state.
* The party took a strong position in favour of law and order, and it favoured the Dutch monarchy
* The party was fiscally conservative, combining support for the welfare state with tight budgetary controls.

===Social wing===
Although most CHU members of parliament were conservatives, some others were more moderate and belonged to the social wing of the party. The more socially oriented MP&#x27;s were: Johan Reinhardt Snoeck Henkemans (1862–1945), Jan Rudolph Slotemaker de Bruïne (1869–1941), Frida Katz (1885–1963), Jouke Bakker (1873–1956), Piet Lieftinck (1902–1989), Henk Kikkert (1912–1988), Cor van Mastrigt (1909–1997), jkvr. Bob Wttewaall van Stoetwegen (1901–1986), Arnold Tilanus (1910–1996), Coos Huijsen (*1939), Ernst van Eeghen (1920–2007), Wim Deetman (*1945) and Nellien de Ruiter (1926–2000). The highly popular Jkvr. Bob Wttewaall van Stoetwegen, long-time member of parliament after the Second World War and befriended with the queen, was considered reasonably progressive on social issues (decolonisation of the Dutch Indies, women emancipation, housing, prison reforms, welfare), as was her colleague, the unionist, Henk Kikkert (welfare, housing).

==Organisation==

===National organisation===
The party had a federal organisation with strong local branches and an independent parliamentary party, without party discipline. It has been classified as an elite party.

===Linked organisations===
The party published the magazine &quot;C.H. Nederlander&quot; (&quot;Christian Historical Dutchman&quot;). Its youth organisation was the Christelijk-Historische Jongeren Organisatie (English: Christian Historical Youth Organisation Anti-Revolutionary Youth Studyclubs). Its scientific institute was the De Savornin Lohman foundation.

===International organisations===
Internationally, the CHU was a relatively isolated party. In the European Parliament, its members sat in the Christian Democratic faction.

===Pillarised organisations===
The party had weak ties to many Protestant organisations, such as the Dutch Reformed Church, the Protestant broadcaster NCRV, the employers&#x27; organisation NCW, the trade union CNV and the Christian Farmers&#x27; Organisation. Together these organisations formed the Protestant pillar, over which the Anti-Revolutionary Party had far more control than the CHU. Rather than use a pillar, the CHU appealed to unaffiliated conservative Protestants. The party did own its own newspaper, &quot;De Nederlander&quot;.

The CHU had a separate party organisation for women, &quot;Centrale van Christelijk Historische Vrouwengroepen&quot;.

== Election results ==
===House of Representatives===
==Electorate==
The electorate of the CHU has seen three decisive shifts, especially in its relation with the ARP, the other Protestant party. Although dates are given here, the changes were gradual
*Between 1908 and 1917, the CHU appealed to the aristocracy, the people with double names, nobility, land owners, high officers and high-ranking civil servants, who opposed universal suffrage.
*Between 1917 and 1967, the CHU appealed to members of the Dutch Reformed Church.
*Between 1967 and 1977, in the time of secularisation and depillarisation the party retained its conservative image.

<text>Tiundaland is a historic region, &quot;Folkland&quot;, and since 1296 part of the modern province of Uppland. It originally meant the &quot;land of the ten hundreds&quot; and referred to its duty of providing 1000 men and 40 ships for the Swedish king&#x27;s leidang.

A list from 1314 defines Tiundaland as Bälinge Hundred, Gästrikland, Håbo Hundred, Hagunda Hundred, Norunda Hundred, Närding Hundred, Oland Hundred, Rasbo Hundred, Ulleråker Hundred and Vaksala Hundred.

During the Viking Age it probably extended from the coast of the Baltic Sea by Norrtälje to the bay which today is the lake Mälaren. A very strategic position. 

According to Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; it was the location of Uppsala and the Thing of all Swedes, where every year there were great blóts which were attended by many kings. He relates that Tiundaland was the richest and most fertile region of Sweden where was the seat of the Swedish kings at Uppsala, the Swedish Archbishopric and from which Uppsala öd had taken its name. All the Swedish lawspeakers were subordinate to the one of Tiundaland.

:&quot;The third portion of Svithjod proper is called Tiundaland; the fourth Attundaland; the fifth Sialand (Roslagen), and what belongs to it lies eastward along the coast. Tiundaland is the best and most inhabited part of Svithjod, under which the other kingdoms stand. There Upsala is situated, the seat of the king and archbishop; and from it Upsala-audr (Uppsala öd), or the domain of the Swedish kings, takes its name. Each of these divisions of the country has its Lag-thing, and Its own laws in many parts. Over each is a lagman&quot; [lawspeaker], &quot;who rules principally in affairs of the bondes&quot; [yeomen]&quot;: for that becomes law which he, by his speech, determines them to make law: and if king, earl, or bishop goes through the country, and holds a Thing with the bondes, the lagmen [law speakers] reply on account of the bondes, and they all follow their lagmen; so that even the most powerful men scarcely dare to come to their Al-thing without regarding the bondes&#x27; and lagmen&#x27;s law. And in all matters in which the laws differ from each other, Upsala-law is the directing law; and the other lagmen are under the lagman who dwells in Tiundaland.&quot;

<text>The Courier (known as The Courier &amp; Advertiser between 1926 and 2012) is a newspaper published by DC Thomson in Dundee, Scotland. As of 2013, it is printed in six regional editions: Dundee, Angus &amp; The Mearns, Fife, West Fife, Perthshire, and Stirlingshire. However, by 2020 this had been reduced to three regional editions for Perth and Perthshire; Angus and Dundee; and Fife. In the months July to December 2024, the average daily circulation of the Courier was 17,737, a minor increase from 2023 although significantly down from the 30,179 copies sold in December 2019.

== History ==
Established in 1801 as the &quot;Dundee Courier &amp; Argus&quot;, the entire front page of &quot;The Courier&quot; used to contain classified advertisements – a traditional newspaper format for many years. In 1809 it was taken over by Robert Rintoul who used the paper to campaign for political reform, and criticism of local politicians such as Alexander Riddoch.

In 1926, during the General Strike &quot;The Courier&quot; was merged with &quot;The Advertiser&quot;. From the 10 May to 28 May 1926, the paper adopted the headline-news format of &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, before reverting to its previous format which it maintained until 1992. The next major change to the newspaper came on 21 January 2012, when it changed to a compact format, having previously existed as a broadsheet. Editor Richard Neville said the move represented the &quot;dawn of a new era&quot; and that the company was &quot;investing in new sections, increasing content across the title and investing significantly in resources.&quot; Just over a year later, a digital version of the newspaper was launched. In 2016, the year of its bicentenary, &quot;The Courier&quot; was named the UK Regional Newspaper of the Year.

In 2022, &quot;The Courier&quot; was named Scotland&#x27;s news website of the year at the Scottish Press Awards.

<doc id="1058682" wikidata="Q7635567" url="?curid=1058682" title="Suite for Microtonal Piano">
<text>Suite for Microtonal Piano (1978) is a suite for specifically microtonally tuned piano(s) by Ben Johnston written in 1977 (see also just intonation). According to Bob Gilmore the piece, &quot;take[s] extended just intonation well beyond the point reached by Harry Partch.&quot;

&quot;The piano is tuned to a selection of overtones from the fifth octave of the harmonic spectrum of C. All octaves are tuned in the same scale...The lowest C (33 Hz.) can be used to tune the scale by ear. In succession, touch the nodes producing the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, [and] 19th partials. Then G, D; D, A; E, B; [and] B-flat, F; are just (beatless) fifths.&quot;

==Movements==
# Alarum
# Blues
# Etude
# Song
# Toccata

&quot;Alarum&quot; is a Shakespeare era stage direction indicating &quot;a grand entrance&quot; and an archaic word for a call to arms, so &quot;Alarum&quot; is a fanfare.

&quot;Blues&quot; and &quot;Song&quot; are both slow movements. &quot;Blues&quot; uses as blue notes the minor seventh (C-B) and mediant (in D dorian exactly halfway between E and G). &quot;Song&quot; is in E phrygian.

&quot;Etude&quot; is a study in serial technique and six-against-five polyrhythms in which Johnston indicates &quot;blur with pedal&quot;. This, &quot;clues us in that the linear intricacies are only part of the story here: the amazing swirl of overtones resulting from an atonal application of this tuning are of equal importance.&quot;

&quot;Toccata&quot; features diatonic outer sections and a spikier chromatic middle section.

The piece has been recorded and released on:
*&quot;Microtonal Piano by Ben Johnston&quot; (1997). Phillip Bush, piano. Koch International Classics 3-7369-2.

<text>Sten Olof Håkan Johansson (born 31 July 1937) is a Swedish politician, who was the leader of the Swedish Centre Party from 1987 to 1998 and Minister for the Environment from 1991 to 1994.

Olof Johansson was born in Ljungby, Kalmar County. He studied at the Stockholm School of Economics, and was the leader of the Centre Party youth organisation from 1969 to 1971. In 1971 he was elected a Member of the Swedish Parliament, a position he held until 1976, and again 1978–1979 and 1982–1998. He held cabinet posts in the centre-right governments 1976–1978 and 1979–1982. In 1987 he succeeded Karin Söder, who stepped down for health reasons, as the leader of the Centre Party. When the centre-right regained power in 1991, Johansson became Minister for the Environment in the Carl Bildt government, but left the post over his opposition to the construction of the Oresund Bridge in the summer of 1994, shortly before the Social Democrats regained power in the September elections.

After having seen his party doing badly in the elections of 1994 and still trailing in the polls less than a year before the upcoming 1998 elections, Johansson stepped down as party leader, leaving the fate of the party in the hands of his little-known successor Lennart Daléus, prompting the Centre Party to print election posters with a portrait of Daléus, simply saying &quot;This is Lennart&quot;.

In 1999, he was awarded the Illis quorum.

After his withdrawal from politics he has been appointed as Chairman of the board of various institutions and companies. Most notably, he was the chairman of the Swedish state-owned alcohol monopoly company, Systembolaget, between 2002 and 2009.

<doc id="1058690" wikidata="Q901092" url="?curid=1058690" title="Lee–Metford">
<text>The Lee–Metford (also known as the Magazine Lee–Metford) is a British bolt action rifle which combined James Paris Lee&#x27;s rear-locking bolt system and detachable magazine with an innovative seven-groove rifled barrel designed by William Ellis Metford. It replaced the Martini–Henry as the standard service rifle of the British Empire in 1888, following nine years of development and trials, but remained in service for only a short time until replaced by the Lee–Enfield.

==Design==

Lee&#x27;s bolt action mechanism was a :

* The rear-mounted lugs placed the operating handle much closer to the rifleman, over the trigger. This made it much quicker to operate than other, forward-mounted lug designs which forced the rifleman to move his hand forward to operate the bolt. It also enabled the rifleman to operate the trigger with his middle finger while still holding the bolt between thumb and index finger.

* The bolt&#x27;s distance of travel was identical with the length of the cartridge, whereas in forward mounted lug designs bolt travel was cartridge length plus lug length. This also meant the firer did not have to lift his face out of the way when drawing back the bolt.

* The bolt lift was 60 degrees compared to the 90 degree rotation of some French and Mauser-style actions, both speedier and also meaning the rifleman did not lose the sight picture when the bolt handle was in the open position.

In addition Lee introduced a detachable box magazine to replace the integral magazines in use with most repeaters, and this magazine offered greater capacity than the competing Mannlicher design. Metford&#x27;s polygonal rifling was adopted to reduce fouling from powder residue building up in the barrel, and to make cleaning easier. The magazines were also chained to the weapon to prevent loss, as they were expensive to produce at the time.

In spite of its many advantageous features, the Lee–Metford was something of an anachronism, due to its use of a black powder–loaded cartridge. By the time of the rifle&#x27;s introduction, rifle design had moved on to using small-calibre smokeless powder cartridges, which allowed bullets to be propelled at much higher velocities without as much smoke or residue. The .303 ammunition designed for the rifle was in fact originally intended to be loaded with a smokeless propellant, but as a result of protracted development, selection of a smokeless propellant was delayed, forcing the British to rely on black powder in the interim. By the time Cordite cartridges were available, it was found that they were wholly unsuited for use with the shallow Metford rifling, which would wear out and render barrels unusable after approximately 6,000 rounds, compared to the 10,000 rounds that the deeper, square-cut Enfield rifling pattern rifles could deliver. The Lee rifles fitted with Enfield barrels became known as Lee Enfields.
Regardless of the shortfalls brought about by the use of black powder, the Lee–Metford went through several revisions during its short service life, with the principal changes being to the magazine (from eight-round single stack to ten-round staggered), sights, and safety. Starting in 1895, the Lee–Metford started to be phased out in favor of the mechanically-similar Lee–Enfield for the reasons outlined above, involving a change to Enfield barrels and sights adjusted for the flatter trajectory enabled by the smokeless propellant.

==Replacement==
Replacement of the Lee–Metford rifles took several years to achieve, and they were still in service in some units during the Second Boer War in 1899. Poor sighting-in and quality control at the factory level resulted in British rifles being woefully inaccurate at ranges greater than . Nonetheless, captured Lee–Metford rifles became the primary weapon for the Boers too when their Mauser ammunition ran out.

The British considered an entirely new rifle, the Pattern 1913 Enfield, based upon a modified Mauser design, but its development was cut short by the First World War and the eminently adaptable Lee–Enfield served for another half century.

In British service the Lee–Metford was also upgraded to the standards of later rifle patterns (e.g. to charger loading and Short Rifle, the SMLE pattern), though the barrel was almost always switched to one with Enfield pattern rifling. The Lee–Metford was produced commercially and used by civilian target shooters until the outbreak of World War I, as it was considered to be inherently more accurate than the Enfield pattern of rifling. In this context, barrels and boltheads could be replaced as frequently as the owner wished, or could afford. It remained a reserve arm in many parts of the British Empire into WWII, even being issued to the New Zealand Home Guard and the Australian Volunteer Defence Corps until more modern rifles could be obtained. The Lee–Metford is still in ceremonial use with the Atholl Highlanders.

==Charlton Automatic Rifle==
Small numbers of Lee–Metford rifles were built as, or converted to, experimental semi-automatic loading systems, such as the British Howell and South African Reider and the best-known of which was the Charlton Automatic Rifle, designed by a New Zealander, Philip Charlton in 1941 to act as a substitute for the Bren and Lewis gun light machine guns which were in chronically short supply at the time. During the Second World War, the majority of New Zealand&#x27;s land forces were deployed in North Africa. When Japan entered the war in 1941, New Zealand found itself lacking the light machine guns that would be required for local defence should the Japanese invade, and so the New Zealand Government funded the development of self-loading conversions for the Lee–Metford rifle. The end result was the Charlton Automatic Rifle (based on the obsolete MLE), which was issued to Home Guard units in NZ from 1942. Over 1,500 conversions were made, including a handful in Australia by Electrolux using Lithgow SMLE Mk III* rifles.

The two Charlton designs differed markedly in external appearance (amongst other things, the New Zealand Charlton had a forward pistol grip and bipod, whilst the Australian one did not), but shared the same operating mechanism. Most of the Charlton Automatic Rifles were destroyed in a fire after the Second World War, but a few examples survive in museums and private collections.

<doc id="1058693" wikidata="Q1194783" url="?curid=1058693" title="Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development">
<text>Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic as a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago in 1958 and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.

The theory holds that moral reasoning, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for ethical behavior, has six developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor. Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding on Piaget&#x27;s work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individual&#x27;s life, a notion that led to dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.

The six stages of moral development occur in phases of pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional morality. For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion and classified it into one of six stages.

There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments have been made that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as domains or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly &quot;post hoc&quot; rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists) of intuitive decisions.

A new field within psychology was created by Kohlberg&#x27;s theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.&#x27;s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent. Kohlberg&#x27;s scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone&#x27;s behavior is; there should be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave. The general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.

==Stages==
Kohlberg&#x27;s six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget&#x27;s constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.

:&quot;Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)&quot;
:::1. Obedience and punishment orientation
::::: (&quot;How can I avoid punishment?&quot;)
:::2. Self-interest orientation
::::: (&quot;What&#x27;s in it for me?&quot;)
::::: (&quot;Paying for a benefit&quot;)

:&quot;Level 2 (Conventional)&quot;

:::3. Interpersonal accord and conformity
::::: (&quot;Social norms&quot;)
::::: (&quot;The good boy/girl attitude&quot;)
:::4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation
::::: (&quot;Law and order morality&quot;)

:&quot;Level 3 (Post-Conventional)&quot;

:::5. Social contract orientation
:::6. Universal ethical principles
::::: (&quot;Principled conscience&quot;)

The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.

===Pre-conventional===
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children and is expected to occur in animals, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society&#x27;s conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.

In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. &quot;The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again.&quot; The worse the punishment for the act is, the more &quot;bad&quot; the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is &quot;egocentric&quot;, lacking recognition that others&#x27; points of view are different from one&#x27;s own. There is &quot;deference to superior power or prestige&quot;.

An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child&#x27;s classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.

Stage two (self-interest driven) expresses the &quot;what&#x27;s in it for me&quot; position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest, or whatever is &quot;convenient,&quot; but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one&#x27;s reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual&#x27;s own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a &quot;You scratch my back, and I&#x27;ll scratch yours&quot; mentality, which is commonly described as quid pro quo, a Latin term that means doing or giving something in order to get something in return. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual&#x27;s own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world&#x27;s perspective is often seen as morally relative. See also: reciprocal altruism.

===Conventional===
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society&#x27;s views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society&#x27;s conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society&#x27;s norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule&#x27;s appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.

In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society&#x27;s views. They try to be a &quot;good boy&quot; or &quot;good girl&quot; to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person&#x27;s relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the &quot;golden rule&quot;. &quot;I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me.&quot; Conforming to the rules for one&#x27;s social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that &quot;they mean well&quot;.

In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dicta, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.

===Post-conventional===
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual&#x27;s own perspective may take precedence over society&#x27;s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.

Kohlberg has speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.

In Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to/that meet &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number of people&quot;. This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.

In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another&#x27;s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level. Touro College Researcher Arthur P. Sullivan helped support the accuracy of Kohlberg&#x27;s first five stages through data analysis, but could not provide statistical evidence for the existence of Kohlberg&#x27;s sixth stage. Therefore, it is difficult to define/recognize as a concrete stage in moral development.

===Further stages===
In his empirical studies of individuals throughout their life, Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality. In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to five, that shared characteristics of both. In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong. Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.

Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning. Kohlberg&#x27;s difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage, however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.

==Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)==

Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral &quot;reasonings&quot; adopted by individuals and do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual&#x27;s actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the &quot;form and structure&quot; of moral arguments is independent of the &quot;content&quot; of those arguments, a position he calls &quot;formalism&quot;.

Kohlberg&#x27;s theory follows the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.

Kohlberg&#x27;s theory understands values as a critical component of &quot;the right&quot;. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid among societies (a position known as &quot;moral universalism&quot;): there can be no relativism. Morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.

According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual&#x27;s innate dispositions or a result of past inductions.

===Formal elements===
Progress through Kohlberg&#x27;s stages happens due to the individual&#x27;s increasing competence, psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called &quot;justice operation.&quot; Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: &quot;equality,&quot; which involves impartial regard for persons, and &quot;reciprocity&quot;, which means regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is &quot;reversibility,&quot; in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as &quot;moral musical chairs&quot;).

Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual&#x27;s &quot;view of persons&quot; and their &quot;social perspective level&quot;, each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The &quot;view of persons&quot; can be understood as the individual&#x27;s grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric. The social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.

==Examples of applied moral dilemmas==
Kohlberg established the &quot;Moral Judgement Interview&quot; in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.

A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist&#x27;s dilemma: &quot;Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe.&quot; Other stories on moral dilemma that Kohlberg used in his research were about two young men trying to skip town, both steal money to leave town but the question then becomes whose crime was worse out of the two. A boy, Joe, saving up money for camp and must decide whether to use his money for camp or give it to his father who wants to use the money to go on a trip with his friends. And a story about Judy and Louise, two sisters, and whether Louise should tell their mother the truth about Judy telling a lie to their mother, that she didn&#x27;t have money to spend on clothes because she went to a concert.

==Critiques==
===Androcentrism===

A critique of Kohlberg&#x27;s theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan, in her book &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;, has argued that Kohlberg&#x27;s theory is excessively androcentric. Kohlberg&#x27;s theory was initially based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, being primarily concerned with details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan&#x27;s theory of moral development does not value justice above other considerations. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers of the American Enterprise Institute argued that Gilligan&#x27;s research is ill-founded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.

===Cross-cultural generalizability===
Kohlberg&#x27;s stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its use for several cultures (particularly in the case of the highest developmental stages). Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although cultures inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;kohlberg/gilligan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures do place some value of life, truth, and law, but to assert that these values are virtually universal requires more research. While there had been some research done to support Kohlberg&#x27;s assumption of universality for his stages of moral development, there are still plenty of caveats and variations yet to be understood and researched. Regarding universality, stages 1, 2, and 3 of Kohlberg&#x27;s theory can be seen as universal stages cross culturally, only until stages 4 and 5 does universality begin to be scrutinized. According to Snarey and Kelio, Kohlberg&#x27;s theory of moral development is not represented in ideas like Gemeinschaft of the communitive feeling. While there had been criticism directed towards the cross-cultural universality of Kohlberg&#x27;s theory, Carolyn Edwards argued that the dilemma interview method, the standard scoring system, and the cognitive-development theory are all valid and productive in teaching and understanding of moral reasoning across all cultures.

===Inconsistency in moral judgments===
Another criticism of Kohlberg&#x27;s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interested reasoning (stage two) than authority and social order obedience reasoning (stage four). Kohlberg&#x27;s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Jeremy Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg&#x27;s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg&#x27;s theory to account for conflicting findings but eventually concluded that the theory cannot account for how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives. Immanuel Kant &quot;predicted&quot; and rebutted that argument when he considered such actions as opening an exception for ourselves in the categorical imperative.

===Reasoning vs. intuition===

Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights or ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered &quot;post hoc&quot; rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg&#x27;s theory suggests.

===Apparent lack of postconventional reasoning in moral exemplars===
In 1999, some of Kohlberg&#x27;s measures were tested when Anne Colby and William Damon published a study in which the development was examined in the lives of moral exemplars that exhibited high levels of moral commitment in their everyday behavior. The researchers utilized the moral judgement interview (MJI) and two standard dilemmas to compare the 23 exemplars with a more ordinary group of people. The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. They found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg&#x27;s scale; they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the &quot;moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects&#x27; educational attainment in this study&quot;. Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars&#x27; scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg&#x27;s highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour. Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements.

Rather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker&#x27;s cluster analysis of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the &quot;caring&quot; or &quot;communal&quot; cluster was strongly relational and generative, the &quot;deliberative&quot; cluster had sophisticated epistemic and moral reasoning, and the &quot;brave&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; cluster was less distinguished by personality.

==Continued relevance==
Kohlberg&#x27;s bodies of work on the stages of moral development have been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the &quot;Defining Issues Test&quot; (&quot;DIT&quot;) created in 1979 by James Rest, originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview. Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg&#x27;s. It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of &quot;post-conventional thinking&quot;. In 1999 the &quot;DIT&quot; was revised as the &quot;DIT-2&quot;; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required, such as divinity, politics, and medicine.

===William Damon&#x27;s contribution to Kohlberg&#x27;s moral theory===

The American psychologist William Damon developed a theory that is based on Kohlberg&#x27;s research. Still, it has the merit of focusing on and analysing moral reasoning&#x27;s behavioural aspects and not just the idea of justice and rightness. Damon&#x27;s methodology was experimental, using children aged between 3 and 9 who were required to share toys. The study applied the sharing resources technique to operationalise the dependent variable it measured: equity or justice.

The results demonstrated an obvious stage presentation of the righteous, just behaviour.

According to William Damon&#x27;s findings, justice, transposed into action, has 6 successive levels:

* Level 1 – nothing stops the egocentric tendency. The children want all the toys without feeling the need to justify their preference. The justice criterion is the absolute wish of the self;

* Level 2 – the child wants almost all of the toys and justifies his choice in an arbitrary or egocentric manner (e.g., &quot;I should play with them because I have a red dress&quot;, &quot;They are mine because I like them!&quot;);

* Level 3 – the equality criterion emerges (e.g., &quot;We should all have the same number of toys&quot;);

* Level 4 – the merit criterion emerges (e.g., &quot;Johnny should take more because he was such a good boy&quot;);

* Level 5 – necessity is seen as the most important selection criterion (e.g., &quot;She should take the most because she was sick&quot;, &quot;Give more to Matt because he is poor&quot;);

* Level 6 – the dilemmas begin to come up: can justice be achieved, considering only one criterion? The consequence is the combining of criteria: equality + merit, equality + necessity, necessity + merit, equality + necessity + merit.

The final level of Damon&#x27;s mini theory is an interesting display, in the social setting, of the logical cognitive operationalisation. This permits decentration and the combination of many points of view, favouring allocentrism.

<text>The Newhalen River (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Nughiltnu&quot;) is a stream in the Lake and Peninsula Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. Beginning at Six Mile Lake, the Newhalen flows south to enter Iliamna Lake about south of Iliamna.

&quot;Alaska Fishing&quot; describes the river as &quot;the major pathway for a mind-boggling migration of sockeye salmon&quot; that ascend the stream in early summer. The main game fish in addition to sockeye are rainbow trout.

It is possible to float parts of the Newhalen in rafts and kayaks. However, waterfalls rated Class V (extremely difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty and other sections of whitewater rated Class IV (very difficult) mean that the river &quot;is rarely run in its entirety&quot;. The first below Six Mile Lake are Class I (easy), and there is a take-out point, Upper Landing, at the end of this stretch. More difficult water begins below Upper Landing.

<text>A harmonic spectrum is a spectrum containing only frequency components whose frequencies are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency; such frequencies are known as harmonics. &quot;The individual partials are not heard separately but are blended together by the ear into a single tone.&quot;

In other words, if formula_1 is the fundamental frequency, then a harmonic spectrum has the form 
:formula_2

A standard result of Fourier analysis is that a function has a harmonic spectrum if and only if it is periodic.

<text>Faizabad (Hindustani pronunciation: ) is a city located in Ayodhya district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is situated on the southern bank of the River Saryu about 6.5 km from Ayodhya City, the district headquarter, 130 km east of the state capital Lucknow. Faizabad was the first capital of the Nawabs of Awadh and has monuments built by those Nawabs, like the Tomb of Bahu Begum, Gulab Bari. It was also the headquarters of Faizabad district (now Ayodhya district) and Faizabad division (now Ayodhya division) before November 2018. Faizabad is a twin city of Ayodhya and it is administered by Ayodhya Municipal Corporation.

==History==


According to &quot;The Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot;, &quot;[w]hen Saadat Khan was appointed governor of Oudh he built a hunting lodge 4 miles west of Ayodhya [in 1730], then the head-quarters of the province. Gardens were laid out and shops sprang up in the neighbourhood, and during the time of his successor Safdar Jang the name Faizabad was first applied. Shuja-ud-daula, the third Nawab, lived chiefly at :Lucknow during the early part of his reign; but after his defeat at Buxar in 1764 he made Faizabad his residence, and during the remainder of his life added largely to its defences and also laid a large town. Shuja-ud-daula died early in 1775, and before the close of the year Asaf-ud-daula moved permanently to Lucknow. The importance of Faizabad declined, but it remained the home of Asaf-ud-daula&#x27;s grandmother and mother, the Nawab Begam and Bahu Begam, whose treatment was the subject of charges against Warren Hastings. After the death of Bahu Begam in 1816 Faizabad decayed still farther&quot;. Oudh State was annexed by the British in 1856. Local self-government for Ayodhya and Faizabad was introduced in 1865. The two cities were administered jointly as a municipality. 

=== Establishment of Princely state of Awadh ===
Gulab Bari stands in a garden surrounded by a wall, approachable through two large gateways. These buildings are particularly interesting for their assimilative architectural styles. Shuja-ud-daula&#x27;s wife was the well known Bahu Begum, who married the Nawab in 1743 and continued to reside in Faizabad, her residence being the Moti-Mahal. Close by at Jawaharbagh lies her Maqbara, where she was buried after her death in 1816. It is considered to be one of the finest buildings of its kind in Avadh, which was built at the cost of three lakh rupees by her chief advisor Darab Ali Khan. A fine view of the city is obtainable from top of the begum&#x27;s tomb. Bahu Begum was a woman of great distinction and rank, bearing dignity. Most of the Muslim buildings of Faizabad are attributed to her. From the date of Bahu Begum&#x27;s death in 1815 until the annexation of Avadh, the city of Faizabad gradually fell into decay. The glory of Faizabad finally eclipsed with the shifting of capital from Faizabad to Lucknow by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula.
Faizabad was also a centre of one of many battles of the Mutiny of 1857. A detailed history of Faizabad can be read in &#x27;Tareekh-e-Farahbaksh&#x27;, written by Munshi Mohd. Faiz Baksh, (after whom Faizabad is named) a courtier in the Shuja-ud-Daula&#x27;s court. This book has been translated into English by Hamid Afaq Qureshi as &#x27;Memoirs of Faizabad&#x27;. Faizabad also finds a prominent and detailed mention in &quot;Guzashta Lucknow&quot; written by Abdul Halim Sharar. The fourth nawab of Awadh, Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, shifted the Capital of Avadh to Lucknow in 1775 after his terms with his mother became sour.

<text>Moist von Lipwig is a fictional character from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series. A &quot;reformed con-man&quot; who is one of the major characters of the series, von Lipwig is the protagonist of the novels &quot;Going Postal&quot;, &quot;Making Money,&quot; and &quot;Raising Steam&quot;.

==Plot summary==
===Background===
Pratchett does not provide an extensive backstory for von Lipwig, born in the town of Lipwig in Überwald, where he lost his parents at an early age. In &quot;Going Postal,&quot; he is described as being bullied at school, and running away to become a traveling conman. Being an unreliable narrator, the reader is unsure of whether parts of his backstory are true, for example, he is unclear on his age and his living through the breakup of the unholy empire. 

He is also described as having no notable physical traits, and so characters forget him easily. Descriptions of his height, appearance and age vary between different characters in the novel, which he uses to his advantage, by wearing disguises such as fake glasses and ear hair wigs. Before his eventual capture, he uses a variety of different aliases, and becomes an expert forger of handwriting.

===Civil service===
In &quot;Going Postal&quot;, Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork arranged to have Lipwig survive his hanging. When Lipwig woke up, Vetinari offered him a job as Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s Postmaster General which Lipwig could take or reject of his own free will (the alternative being, essentially, death, again of his own free will). At that time, the city&#x27;s postal service had long since ceased operation, the remaining two employees doing useless things punctiliously every day. The task of restoring it had claimed the lives of four of Vetinari&#x27;s clerks, and the competing and mercilessly corporate Clacks network, the Grand Trunk Clacks Company, was being run by a conman, Reacher Gilt. Lipwig nonetheless manages to revive the postal service by applying the principles of the con to honest work, introduces the postage stamp and causes the downfall of the Grand Trunk Clacks Company by exposing the fraudulent practices introduced by Gilt. By the beginning of &quot;Making Money&quot;, the Clacks network is run by the Ankh-Morpork Postal Service.

Moist, and the Post Office, has a very minor cameo in &quot;Thud!&quot;. Commander Vimes notices that the Ankh-Morpork Post Office has issued two different sets of stamps commemorating the Battle of Koom Valley, one in which the Dwarfs are winning the battle, the other the Trolls, and he makes an angry remark about &quot;that pea-brain at the Post Office&quot; (probably referring to Stanley, the Head of Stamps Dept, who&#x27;s known to have been raised by peas). He also mentions the cabbage stamp with the potentially explosive cabbage scented glue, of which Corporal Nobbs has stolen the Watch&#x27;s confiscated examples.

In &quot;Making Money&quot;, Moist is very respectable and is up for many rewards and seats due to his efforts. He also breaks into his own office just to keep things interesting. The Patrician offers Moist the additional job of running the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork and the Royal Mint just behind it. He refuses this offer. Vetinari does not force him to take the job as he did in Going Postal, because he knows that Moist will eventually accept. Moist denies this despite Vetinari&#x27;s accusations that he is bored of working at the post office. However, the chairwoman of the bank leaves all her shares to her dog Mr. Fusspot when she dies (thereby making the dog the new chair of the bank), and leaves the dog to Moist. The Assassin&#x27;s Guild is alerted to the situation and contracted to kill Moist should he refuse the job or should Mr. Fusspot be killed. Therefore, he becomes responsible for the bank. Moist becomes the Master of the Royal Mint, introduces paper money to Ankh-Morpork, and revolutionizes the bank, while keeping it out of the hands of the greedy Lavish family who sit on the board of directors. At the end of the novel, it was suggested that Moist would be appointed to the position of Chief Tax Collector.

In &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, steam locomotives are invented and plans are made by Lord Vetinari and the Ankh-Morpork and Sto Plains Hygienic Railway Company to construct railway lines ultimately to as far away as Genua. Moist is first tasked with negotiating the purchase or acquisition of lands needed for railway construction, first throughout the Sto Plains, and later Quirm. Following a palace coup against the Low King of the Dwarves, Rhys Rhysson, Moist is required to fulfil the logistically difficult task of constructing a railway line to Schmaltzberg. Despite Moist&#x27;s own protestations regarding the impossibility of the task, he nevertheless succeeds and the Low King is restored to power with little resistance. At the Wilinus Pass, it is suggested that Moist secretly, and without authorization, used Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s Umian golems (brought to the city in &quot;Making Money&quot;) to somehow convey a train over the ravine. While everyone else involved with the journey are given honours and medals, Moist&#x27;s reward is being allowed to continue living.

===Personal life===
Moist von Lipwig meets and begins courting Adora Belle Dearheart in &quot;Going Postal&quot;. By &quot;Making Money&quot;, the two are engaged. Dearheart plays an important role in Lipwig&#x27;s life, in that dating her provides him with the dangerous thrill he needs in his life. When she is away, he needs to perform various dangerous activities, such as climbing high buildings and extreme sneezing.

Lipwig is not a follower of a particular god. However, a con he perpetrated in &quot;Going Postal&quot; led to a massive increase in the popularity of the goddess Anoia. In &quot;Making Money&quot;, he takes up praying to her, on the basis that she owes him for her newfound popularity.

In &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, it is revealed that Moist and Adora Belle have since married and now live in a mansion on Scoone Avenue, in Ankh (the same area where the Duke and Duchess of Ankh, Sam and Sybil Vimes, live). While Moist continues to run both the Royal Ankh-Morpork Post Office and the Royal Mint and Bank, Adora Belle runs the Clacks and has made it an equal opportunities employer, also hiring golems and Goblins.

==TV adaptation==

In the Sky TV adaptation of &quot;Going Postal&quot;, von Lipwig was portrayed by actor Richard Coyle. Coyle is also set to narrate the Moist von Lipwig series of &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, adapted by Audible.

==Reception==
The character was included in a list of the top ten Discworld characters by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2013; Tim Martin states that the character &quot;gives Pratchett the opportunity for some of his finest satiric stabs at modern culture&quot;. In a review of &quot;Making Money&quot; for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Patrick Ness describes von Lipwig as &quot;a fresh new character&quot; written &quot;to poke serious fun at City institutions&quot;. Jim Shanahan, in a chapter on Pratchett&#x27;s works, describes the character as a &quot;reformed con-man&quot; who &quot;drives technological change&quot;. Amy Lea Clemons, in a chapter on Discworld, describes von Lipwig as a &quot;complicating character&quot;; she comments on his use of language to deceive his audience and states that the character presents a contrast with the &quot;more rigid ethical rhetorics&quot; of Granny Weatherwax, Sam Vimes and Carrot Ironfoundersson. Michelle West, in a review of &quot;Going Postal&quot; for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, describes von Lipwig as &quot;the anti-Vimes; he&#x27;s not a man who believes, and hates believing in a world that gives him so little purchase; he&#x27;s a man who doesn&#x27;t believe. In anything./ Which is part of what makes the book so satisfying&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, in a review of &quot;Making Money&quot;, describes von Lipwig as a &quot;brilliant scalawag of a hero&quot;.

<text>Now (styled as NOW), also known as NOW Magazine is an online publication based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Through most of its existence, &quot;Now&quot; was a free alternative weekly newspaper. Physical publication of &quot;Now&quot; was suspended in August 2022, amid the bankruptcy of its former owner Media Central Corporation, although some new content was still published to its website. In January 2023, it was announced that the publication will be acquired by journalist Brandon Gonez.

==Publication history==
&quot;Now&quot; was first published on September 10, 1981, by Michael Hollett and Alice Klein. &quot;NOW&quot; is an alternative weekly that covers news, culture, arts, and entertainment. In its printed incarnation, &quot;NOW&quot; was published 52 times a year and could be picked up in Toronto subway stations, cafes, variety stores, clothing outlets, restaurants, alternative movie venues, and in its green and red newspaper boxes. &quot;NOW&quot; was published every Thursday for a period of over 40 years, from 1981 to 2022. In March 2022, NOW Magazine switched to monthly publication in an effort to save money. By August, the printed magazine was abandoned entirely. 

&quot;NOW&quot; has been online since 1993, first as now.com and then as nowtoronto.com since 2000.

It is also a central sponsor and its owners held an ownership stake in North by Northeast, a major annual music festival in Toronto. 

&quot;NOW&quot; was privately owned by Hollett and Klein until 2016, when Hollett sold his share of the company to Klein and left the newspaper to focus on North by Northeast as the festival&#x27;s president and founder. Hollett became sole owner of NXNE when he sold his shares in NOW. Hollett started a new national music and arts print publication, NEXT Magazine, in 2020, publishing in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary,

In 2019, Klein&#x27;s NOW Communications sold &quot;NOW&quot; to Media Central Corporation for $2 million. Klein remained with the newspaper as &quot;Chief Editorial Strategist&quot;. A few weeks later, Media Central Corporation also announced a deal to acquire the similar Vancouver publication &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;.

In April 2022, Media Central Corp Inc., of which NOW Central Communications Inc. is a subsidiary of, that owns and publishes NOW Magazine, filed for bankruptcy. Soon afterward, several of its longtime staff members left, notably film critic Norman Wilner leaving to take a job as a programmer for the Toronto International Film Festival.

In August, film critic and acting editor Radheyan Simonpillai stated on Twitter that the August 18 issue would be the publication&#x27;s &quot;last masthead&quot;; in an interview on CBC&#x27;s &quot;Metro Morning&quot; the following day, he clarified that the publication was not necessarily going out of business entirely, but would not be releasing print issues for the foreseeable future and many of its remaining staff were owed weeks of back pay.

==Content==
Syndicated content in &quot;NOW&quot; included Dan Savage&#x27;s &quot;Savage Love&quot; sex advice column, Matt Groening&#x27;s &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic and Rob Brezsny&#x27;s &quot;Real Astrology&quot;. Notable writers and editors have included Matt Galloway, Naomi Klein, Cameron Bailey, Kim Hughes, Susan G. Cole, Jon Kaplan, Adria Vasil, Glenn Sumi, Norman Wilner, Radheyan Simonpillai, Kevin Hegge, John Sewell and David Suzuki.

&quot;NOW published several comprehensive guide issues every year. Some of these include: &quot;
In September 2021, Media Central Corporation announced that the company would be selling nine NFTs made from previous covers published by NOW Magazine and Georgia Straight. The NFTs are still listed as open for bidding.

In March 2022, NOW Magazine cut back on printing weekly issues in an effort to save money and grow its online audience. In August, the printed magazine was abandoned entirely.

==Green efforts==
Some of these efforts include the construction of the &quot;Green Roof&quot; in 2006. The roof helps to keep the building temperature regulated while using less energy which aids in keeping pollution low. The plant life, which is a sedum species, helps to purify the air. The green roof also reduces stormwater runoff – which can cause sewage backup during periods of deluge. &quot;NOW&quot; implements a 100% recycled paper policy and uses only vegetable-based dyes for print. This effort, each year, saves over 28,000 living trees, reduces greenhouse gases – the equivalent given off by 534 cars, eliminates 7 swimming pools of waste water and saves 79 garbage trucks worth of solid waste. &quot;Now&quot; also partners with Green Enterprise Toronto (GET) and Canopy (formerly Markets Initiative). Both companies are dedicated to responsible business and green initiatives.

&quot;NOW&quot; is a certified B Corporation.

<text>Richard Frank Johnston (born August 8, 1946) is a retired Canadian provincial politician, educator and administrator.

==Background==
Johnston was born in Pembroke, Ontario and grew up in Peterborough. As a young man he was active in the Anglican church and at one point considered becoming a priest. In 1964, Johnston enrolled at Trent University being the second person to register at the opening year of the university. He also worked at Trent as an administrator and counsellor. In 1967 he moved to Montreal to write fiction and poetry because as he said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t afford Paris.&quot; After that he moved to Whitby where he became a social worker specializing in the elderly. He was the founding executive director of Community Care in Durham Region.

Johnston and his wife operate a vineyard and winery in Prince Edward County.

==Politics==
Johnston&#x27;s first association with politics was in the 1970s when he worked as a campaign organizer for Stephen Lewis in Scarborough West. He was the campaign manager for the 1977 election.

When Lewis left politics, Johnston ran to succeed him as the NDP Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Scarborough West, winning election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in a 1979 by-election. Johnston was re-elected three times before he retired in 1990. The only time he faced a serious challenge was in 1981, when he defeated Progressive Conservative John Adams by 375 votes.

He crusaded for improved benefits to the poor and disabled by attempting to live for a month on a &quot;welfare diet&quot; in 1982, limiting his food budget to that of the average person on welfare.

Johnston ran in the 1982 NDP leadership convention to succeed Michael Cassidy. He characterized himself as a &#x27;rank-and-file&#x27; candidate who was more in tune with the grassroots of the party in contrast with Bob Rae who had the support of leaders in the party and the trade union movement. Johnston received support from the left wing of the party including MPPs Floyd Laughren, Jim Renwick and Ross McClellan. Johnston promoted a strong anti-nuclear stand and was proponent of nationalizing key industries such as the banks, Bell Canada and natural resource companies such as Inco&#x27;s mining and smelting operations. On February 7, 1982, Rae won on the first ballot with 64.5% of the vote beating Johnston by 844 votes. Johnston was magnanimous in defeat saying of Rae, &quot;a leader with an unparalleled capacity to turn a phrase and turn on a crowd. I will be proud to serve in the Legislature with Bob Rae as my leader.&quot;

In the legislature, Johnston served as chair of the NDP caucus and chair of the social development committee during the 1985 to 1987 minority legislature in which the NDP held the balance of power. Johnston, unlike Rae, had originally supported a coalition government with the Liberal Party following the election of 1985.

In 1983, Johnston moved a resolution to declare Ontario a nuclear weapons-free zone but it was defeated, a decision that moved him to tears. In 1987 he introduced a private members bill on the same issue and it was passed with support of all three parties. Only 2 Liberals and 7 Conservatives opposed it. He travelled to Nicaragua to help build a school and medical facility. In 1987, he presented a report to the legislature, &quot;Toward a New Ontario&quot;, which recommended an overhaul of the existing social assistance system.

In 1990, Johnston decided to retire from politics. He said that after suffering a heart attack in 1984 he wanted to pursue a career that was easier on his health.

==After politics==
Following his departure from politics, Johnston returned to academia serving as chair of the Ontario Council of Regents for the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology from 1991 to 1995. He then served as president of the First Nations Technical Institute on the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory from 1995 until 1998 as well as a member of Trent University&#x27;s board of directors. Johnston served as president of Centennial College in Scarborough from 1998 until 2004.

In 1995 Johnston and his spouse purchased a farm 5 km West of Wellington in Prince Edward County, Ontario. They started By Chadsey&#x27;s Cairns, one of the original wineries founded in &quot;The County&quot; in the 1990s, and continue to run the operation to this day.

In 2006, he was appointed to the board of trustees for OPSEU&#x27;s pension trust.

<doc id="1058777" wikidata="Q3235963" url="?curid=1058777" title="Imperiali quota">
<text>The Imperiali quota or pseudoquota is an unusually-low electoral quota named after Belgian senator Pierre Imperiali. Some election laws used in largest remainder systems mandate it as the portion of votes needed to guarantee a seat.

The Czech Republic and Belgium are the only countries that currently use the Imperiali quota, while Italy and Ecuador used it in the past.. Belgium only uses the Imperiali quota for local elections. 

The pseudoquota is unpopular because of its logically incoherent nature: it is possible for elections using the Imperiali quota to have more candidates pass quota than open seats. When more pass quota than the number of open seats, the result must be recalculated using a different method to allocate seats. This method can be as simple as using relative standing in the votes (plurality). Fair allocation of seats can also be done by using the largest remainder rule.

In some cases, the use of the Imperiali quota distributes seats in a way that is a hybrid between majoritarian and proportional representation, rather than providing actual proportional representation. 

Being smaller than the Droop quota and much smaller than the Hare quota, it aids both more-popular parties and less-popular parties. More-popular parties do not suffer from vote splitting that might deny them additional seats; smaller parties might take a seat due to the Imperiali being low when under the Droop they might be denied.

The Imperiali quota is a part of the Imperiali seat-allocation method of increasingly smaller quotas used in Belgium local elections.

==Formula==
The Imperiali quota may be given as:

:formula_1

*votes = the number of valid (unspoiled) votes cast in an election.
*seats = the number of seats on the legislature or committee.
However, Imperiali violates the inequality for a valid fixed quota: 

formula_2

That is, a valid fixed quota is a number equal to or larger than votes/seats +1 and equal to or smaller than votes/seats minus 1. Imperiali is smaller than this window.

It can lead to impossible allocations that assign parties one or two more seats than actually exist. 

==An example of use in STV==
To see how the Imperiali quota works in an STV election imagine an election in which there are two seats to be filled and three candidates: Andrea, Chris and Drew. There are 100 voters as follows:

There are 100 voters and 2 seats. The Imperiali quota is therefore:

:formula_3

To begin the count the first preferences cast for each candidate are tallied and are as follows:

*Andrea: 65
*Drew: 20
*Chris: 15

Andrea has reached the quota and is declared elected. She has 40 votes more than the quota so these surplus votes are transferred. They go to Chris. The tallies therefore become:

*Chris: 55
*Drew: 20

Chris has now reached the quota so is declared elected. The winners are therefore Andrea and Chris. The use of the Imperiali quota thus did not prevent fair voting. The vote transfer ensured that the voting block that preferred Andrea and Chris did not suffer from vote splitting.

If two candidates had achieved quota on the first count, say each with 35 percent of the vote, there would have been no votes transferred and the two seats would have been filled by the use of 70 percent of the votes cast. 

If by chance all candidates achieved or surpassed quota on the first count, the two seats then could have been allocated just based on relative vote tallies; in case of a tie, by a coin toss or some other method.

<text>Lennart Daléus (born 25 June 1946) is a Swedish politician, who was the leader of the Swedish Centre Party from 1998 to 2001.

Born in Stockholm, Daléus was the leader of the Option 3 campaign for the 1980 referendum on nuclear power in Sweden. Following his stint as Centre Party leader, he was the general secretary of Greenpeace Sweden and the CEO of Greenpeace Scandinavia from 2002 until August 2008. In 2006 he disclosed that he was no longer a member of the Centre Party, as he did not believe that his work for Greenpeace was congruent with being active in a political party. He also criticised the party for its decreased interest in environmental issues.

<doc id="1058784" wikidata="Q450708" url="?curid=1058784" title="Gaius Asinius Gallus">
<text>Gaius Asinius Gallus (before 38 BC – AD 33) was a Roman senator, son of Gaius Asinius Pollio and Quinctia. He was the second husband of Vipsania, whose first husband Tiberius ultimately imprisoned him.

== Biography ==
In 11 BC he married Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and his first wife Caecilia Attica, and the former wife of Tiberius. Their union proved fruitful and produced at least six children. Gallus also claimed true paternity of Drusus Julius Caesar, earning him Tiberius&#x27; animosity. If Gallus&#x27; claim was true, he might also have been the father of the child Vipsania was expecting on her divorce.

He is mentioned among the speakers at the senate meeting discussing Augustus&#x27; funeral in AD 14; on the subject of last honours he proposed that the funeral train should pass under a triumphal gateway. When the senate met to discuss the transfer of power, Gallus made a joke at Tiberius&#x27; expense; when Tiberius made a formulaic protest against the total power the Senate had proposed to award him and said that he would instead take charge of whichever department was assigned to him (a demurral, the sources imply, that he expected the Senate to reject), Gallus responded by asking him to choose whichever he wished. This embarrassed Tiberius publicly, and although Gallus attempted to quell the emperor&#x27;s anger, he was unsuccessful.

In 30, he was arrested on Tiberius&#x27; orders. At Tiberius&#x27; instigation, the Senate declared Gallus a public enemy, and he was held in conditions of solitary confinement: &quot;He had no companion or servant with him, spoke to no one, and saw no one, except when he was compelled to take food. And the food was of such quality and amount as neither to afford him any satisfaction or strength nor yet to allow him to die.&quot;

He died in prison of starvation in the year 33. When Agrippina died in October of that same year, Tiberius accused her of &quot;having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence&quot;. His name was erased from public monuments (a practice known as &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;), although this was reversed after Tiberius&#x27; death.

== Marriage and children ==
Asinius Gallus&#x27; marriage to Vipsania (11 BC) led to the following known children:

*Gaius Asinius Pollio
**He was consul in 23; exiled as an accuser of a conspiracy and later put to death on orders from Empress Valeria Messalina.
*Marcus Asinius Agrippa
**He was consul in 25 and died in 26.
*Gnaeus Asinius Saloninus, or simply Asinius Saloninus
**Tacitus describes him as an ‘eminent’ person. Saloninus was intended to marry one of the granddaughters of Emperor Tiberius. He died in 22.
*Servius Asinius Celer
**He was &quot;consul suffectus&quot; in 38. From Emperor Caligula he purchased a fish at an enormous price. He is mentioned in Seneca&#x27;s satire &quot;The Pumpkinification of Claudius&quot;, where he is listed among the many people killed by that emperor. His death probably occurred sometime before mid-47. Asinius Celer seems to have had a daughter by the name of Asinia Agrippina, though her existence is obscure.
*Lucius Asinius Gallus (sometimes wrongly called Gallo)
**In 46 he conspired with Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus against Claudius and was forced to go into exile. Cassius Dio describes him as being &quot;very small and ugly&quot;. Later rehabilitated, he became Consul in 62.
*Gnaeus Asinius
**His existence is recorded by the townsfolk of Puteoli, whose patron he was. He may have been identical with Asinius Saloninus or the foregoing Asinius Gallus. Since the &quot;Asinius Gallus&quot; seems to have been the &quot;Lucius Asinius Gallus&quot; who became a Consul in 60, by exclusion of parts the &quot;Gnaeus Asinius&quot; must be the &quot;Asinius Saloninus&quot;.

== In fiction ==
In the BBC television series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, Gallus is portrayed by Charles Kay.

In Lloyd C Douglas&#x27;s novel &quot;The Robe&quot;, Gallus is furnished with a fictional daughter, Diana, the love interest of the story.

<text>Erikson&#x27;s stages of psychosocial development, as articulated in the second half of the 20th century by Erik Erikson in collaboration with Joan Erikson, is a comprehensive psychoanalytic theory that identifies a series of eight stages that a healthy developing individual should pass through from infancy to late adulthood.

According to Erikson&#x27;s theory the results from each stage, whether positive or negative, influence the results of succeeding stages. Erikson published a book called &quot;Childhood and Society&quot; in 1950 that highlighted his research on the eight stages of psychosocial development. Erikson was originally influenced by Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychosexual stages of development. He began by working with Freud&#x27;s theories specifically, but as he began to dive deeper into biopsychosocial development and how other environmental factors affect human development, he soon progressed past Freud&#x27;s theories and developed his own ideas. Erikson developed different substantial ways to create a theory about lifespan he theorized about the nature of personality development as it unfolds from birth through old age or death. He argued that the social experience was valuable throughout our life to each stage that can be recognizable by a conflict specifically as we encounter between the psychological needs and the surroundings of the social environment.

Erikson&#x27;s stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight life stages as a function of negotiating their biological and sociocultural forces. The two conflicting forces each have a psychosocial crisis which characterizes the eight stages. If an individual does indeed successfully reconcile these forces (favoring the first mentioned attribute in the crisis), they emerge from the stage with the corresponding virtue. For example, if an infant enters into the toddler stage (autonomy vs. shame and doubt) with more trust than mistrust, they carry the virtue of hope into the remaining life stages. The stage challenges that are not successfully overcome may be expected to return as problems in the future. However, mastery of a stage is not required to advance to the next stage. In one study, subjects showed significant development as a result of organized activities.

==Stages==
== Psychological periodization of stages of human development ==

=== Hope: trust vs. mistrust (oral-sensory, infancy, under 1 year) ===

*Existential Question: Can I Trust the World?

The first stage of Erik Erikson&#x27;s theory centers around the infant&#x27;s basic needs being met by the parents or caregiver and how this interaction leads to trust or mistrust. Trust as defined by Erikson is &quot;an essential trustfulness of others as well as a fundamental sense of one&#x27;s own trustworthiness.&quot; The infant depends on the parents, especially the mother, for sustenance and comfort. Infants will often use methods such as pointing to indicate their interests or desires to their parents or caregivers. The child&#x27;s relative understanding of the world and society comes from the parents and their interaction with the child. Children first learn to trust their parents or a caregiver. If the parents expose their child to warmth, security, and dependable affection, the infant&#x27;s view of the world will be one of trust. As the child learns to trust the world around them, they also acquire the virtue of hope. Should parents fail to provide a secure environment and to meet the child&#x27;s basic needs; a sense of mistrust will result. Development of mistrust can later lead to feelings of frustration, suspicion, withdrawal, and a lack of confidence.

According to Erik Erikson, the major developmental task in infancy is to learn whether or not other people, especially primary caregivers, regularly satisfy basic needs. If caregivers are consistent sources of food, comfort, and affection, an infant learns trust — that others are dependable and reliable. If they are neglectful, or perhaps even abusive, the infant instead learns mistrust — that the world is an undependable, unpredictable, and possibly a dangerous place. Having some experience with mistrust allows the infant to gain an understanding of what constitutes dangerous situations later in life. However, infants and toddlers should not be subjected to prolonged situations of mistrust. This causes children to be ill adjusted later in life and see life with a cautious and careful outlook, which can be detrimental later in their life. In this stage, the child&#x27;s most important needs are to feel safe, comforted, and well cared for.

This stage is where a child learns an attachment style to their caregiver. The attachment style the child develops can affect their relationships through the rest of their life. For example, if the infant is hungry, will it be fed? If their diaper got soiled, would anybody change it? If they&#x27;re sad, will they be comforted? The infant&#x27;s mind would tell if the world is a trustworthy place with trustworthy people. Infants need protection and support from the familiar adult; otherwise, they will most likely not survive. This concept was studied more by Bowlby and Ainsworth in their attachment theory which is consistent with Erikson&#x27;s research.

===Will: autonomy vs. shame/doubt (muscular, toddlerhood, 1–2 years)===
*Existential Question: Is It Okay to Be Me?
As the child gains control over eliminative functions and motor abilities, they begin to explore their surroundings. Parents still provide a strong base of security from which the child can venture out to assert their will. The parents&#x27; patience and encouragement help to foster autonomy in the child. During early childhood, the child will start to have learning tasks and skills that instill personal responsibility, which allows the children to make choices that could help them develop a sense of autonomy and confidence. Children at this age like to explore the world around them and they are constantly learning about their environment. Caution must be taken at this age while children may explore things that are dangerous to their health and safety.

At this age, children develop their first interests. For example, a child who enjoys music may like to play with the radio. Children who enjoy the outdoors may be interested in animals and plants. Highly restrictive parents are more likely to instill in the child a sense of doubt, and reluctance to try new and challenging opportunities. As the child gains increased muscular coordination and mobility, toddlers become capable of satisfying some of their own needs. They begin to feed themselves, wash and dress themselves, and use the bathroom.

If caregivers encourage self-sufficient behavior, toddlers will develop a sense of autonomy—a sense of being able to handle many problems on their own. On the contrary, there is the possibility that the caregiver can demand too much too soon. This will likely lead the child to develop shame and doubt in their ability to handle problems. This shame and doubt could also come as a result of a caregiver ridiculing a child&#x27;s early performance attempts. There is definitely a delicate balance to be had with autonomy. If the child receives too much autonomy, they have the potential to grow up with little concern for rules or regulations. This could also increase the likelihood of injury. Conversely, if the parents exert too much control over them, the child can grow up to be more rebellious and impulsive. The abilities of the child are limited.

===Purpose: initiative vs. guilt (locomotor-genital, early childhood, 3–6 years)===
*Existential Question: Is it Okay for Me to Do, Move, and Act?
Initiative adds to autonomy the quality of planning, undertaking, and attacking a task for the sake of just being active and on the move. The child is learning to master the world around them, learning basic skills and principles of physics. Things fall down, not up, round things roll. They learn how to zip and tie, count and speak with ease. At this stage, the child wants to begin and complete their own actions for a purpose. Guilt is a confusing new emotion. They may feel guilty over things that logically should not cause guilt. They may feel guilt when this initiative does not produce desired results.

The development of courage and independence are what set preschoolers, ages three to six years of age, apart from other age groups. Young children in this category face the psychological crisis of initiative versus guilt. This includes learning how to face complexities of planning and developing a sense of judgment. During this stage, the child learns to take initiative and prepares for leadership roles, and to achieve goals. Activities sought out by a child in this stage may include risk-taking behaviors, such as crossing a street alone or riding a bike without a helmet; both these examples involve self-limits. The child may also develop negative behaviors as they learn to take initiative. These negative behaviors, such as throwing objects, hitting, or yelling, can be a result of the child feeling frustrated after not being able to achieve a goal as planned.

Preschoolers are increasingly able to accomplish tasks on their own and can explore new areas. With this growing independence comes many choices about activities to be pursued. Sometimes children take on projects they can readily accomplish, but at other times they undertake projects that are beyond their capabilities or that interfere with other people&#x27;s plans and activities. If parents and preschool teachers encourage and support children&#x27;s efforts, while also helping them make realistic and appropriate choices, children develop initiative—independence in planning and undertaking activities. But if instead, adults discourage the pursuit of independent activities or dismiss them as silly and bothersome, children develop guilt about their needs and desires.

===Competence: industry vs. inferiority (latency, late childhood, 7–10 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Make it in the World of People and Things?
The aim of this stage is to bring a productive situation to completion which gradually supersedes the whims and wishes of play. The fundamentals of technology are developed. The failure to master trust, autonomy, and industrious skills may cause the child to doubt their future, leading to shame, guilt, and the experience of defeat and inferiority.

The child must deal with demands to learn new skills or risk a sense of inferiority, failure, and incompetence. In doing so, children are able to start contributing to society and making a difference in the world. They become more aware of themselves and how competent, or not, they are.

&quot;Children at this age are becoming more aware of themselves as individuals.&quot; They work hard at &quot;being responsible, being good and doing it right.&quot; They are now more reasonable to share and cooperate. Allen and Marotz (2003) also list some perceptual cognitive developmental traits specific for this age group. Children grasp the concepts of space and time in more logical, practical ways. They gain a better understanding of cause and effect, and of calendar time. At this stage, children are eager to learn and accomplish more complex skills: reading, writing, telling time. They also get to form moral values, recognize cultural and individual differences and are able to manage most of their personal needs and grooming with minimal assistance. At this stage, children might express their independence by talking back and being disobedient and rebellious.

Erikson viewed the elementary school years as critical for the development of self-confidence. Ideally, elementary school provides many opportunities to achieve the recognition of teachers, parents and peers by producing things—drawing pictures, solving addition problems, writing sentences, and so on. If children are encouraged to make and do things and are then praised for their accomplishments, they begin to demonstrate industry by being diligent, persevering at tasks until completed, and putting work before pleasure. If children are instead ridiculed or punished for their efforts or if they find they are incapable of meeting their teachers&#x27; and parents&#x27; expectations, they develop feelings of inferiority about their capabilities.

Children also begin to make relationships with others around them. Being social is especially important for this stage. It helps school aged children become either more or less confident about themselves and their abilities. Also, during this age, children also begin to migrate into their own social groups. Depending on the child&#x27;s &quot;group&quot;, the child will have more or less self confidence.

At this age, children start recognizing their special talents and continue to discover interests as their education improves. They may begin to choose to do more activities to pursue that interest, such as joining a sport if they know they have athletic ability, or joining the band if they are good at music. If not allowed to discover their own talents in their own time, they will develop a sense of lack of motivation, low self-esteem, and lethargy. They may become &quot;couch potatoes&quot; if they are not allowed to develop interests.

===Fidelity: identity vs. role confusion (adolescence, 11–19 years)===
*Existential Question: Who Am I and What Can I Be?

The adolescent is newly concerned with how they appear to others. Superego identity is the accrued confidence that the outer sameness and continuity prepared in the future are matched by the sameness and continuity of one&#x27;s meaning for oneself, as evidenced in the promise of a career. The ability to settle on a school or occupational identity is pleasant. In later stages of adolescence, the child develops a sense of sexual identity. Adolescents become curious about the roles they will play in the adult world as they transition from childhood to adulthood. Initially, they are apt to experience some role confusion—mixed ideas and feelings about the specific ways in which they will fit into society—and may experiment with a variety of behaviors and activities (e.g. tinkering with cars, baby-sitting for neighbors, affiliating with certain political or religious groups). Eventually, Erikson proposed, most adolescents achieve a sense of identity regarding who they are and where their lives are headed.

The teenager must achieve identity in occupation, gender roles, politics, and, in some cultures, religion. This is not always easy, however. The teenager must seek to find their place in this world and to find out how they can contribute to the world.

Erikson is credited with coining the term &quot;identity crisis&quot;. He describes identity crisis as a critical part of development in which an adolescent or youth develops a sense of self. Identity crisis involves the integration of the physical self, personality, potential roles and occupations. It is influenced by culture and historical trends. This stage is necessary for the successful development of future stages. Each stage that came before and that follows has its own &#x27;crisis&#x27;, but even more so now, for this marks the transition from childhood to adulthood. This passage is necessary because &quot;Throughout infancy and childhood, a person forms many identifications. But the need for identity in youth is not met by these.&quot; This turning point in human development seems to be the reconciliation between &#x27;the person one has come to be&#x27; and &#x27;the person society expects one to become&#x27;. This emerging sense of self will be established by &#x27;forging&#x27; past experiences with anticipations of the future. In relation to the eight life stages as a whole, the fifth stage corresponds to the crossroads:

What is unique about the stage of Identity, is that it is a special sort of synthesis of earlier stages and a special sort of anticipation of later ones. Youth has a certain unique quality in a person&#x27;s life; it is a bridge between childhood and adulthood. Youth is a time of radical change—the great body changes accompanying puberty, the ability of the mind to search one&#x27;s own intentions and the intentions of others, the suddenly sharpened awareness of the roles society has offered for later life.

Adolescents &quot;are confronted by the need to re-establish boundaries for themselves and to do this in the face of an often potentially hostile world&quot;. This is often challenging since commitments are being asked for before particular identity roles have formed. At this point, one is in a state of &#x27;identity confusion&#x27;, but society normally makes allowances for youth to &quot;find themselves&quot;, and this state is called &#x27;the moratorium&#x27;:

The problem of adolescence is one of role confusion—a reluctance to commit which may haunt a person into his mature years. Given the right conditions—and Erikson believes these are essentially having enough space and time, a psychosocial moratorium, when a person can freely experiment and explore—what may emerge is a firm sense of identity, an emotional and deep awareness of who they are.

As in other stages, bio-psycho-social forces are at work. No matter how one has been raised, one&#x27;s personal ideologies are now chosen for oneself. Often, this leads to conflict with adults over religious and political orientations. Another area where teenagers are deciding for themselves is their career choice, and often parents want to have a decisive say in that role. If society is too insistent, the teenager will acquiesce to external wishes, effectively forcing him or her to ‘foreclose&#x27; on experimentation and, therefore, true self-discovery. Once someone settles on a worldview and vocation, will they be able to integrate this aspect of self-definition into a diverse society? According to Erikson, when an adolescent has balanced both perspectives of &quot;What have I got?&quot; and &quot;What am I going to do with it?&quot; they have established their identity:

Dependent on this stage is the ego quality of &quot;fidelity—the ability to sustain loyalties freely pledged in spite of the inevitable contradictions and confusions of value systems&quot;. (Italics in original)
Leaving past childhood and facing the unknown of adulthood is a component of adolescence. Another characteristic of this stage is moratorium which tends to end as adulthood begins. Given that the next stage (Intimacy) is often characterized by marriage, many are tempted to cap off the fifth stage at 20 years of age. However, these age ranges are actually quite fluid, especially for the achievement of identity, since it may take many years to become grounded, to identify the object of one&#x27;s fidelity, to feel that one has &quot;come of age&quot;. In the biographies &quot;Young Man Luther&quot; and &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s Truth&quot;, Erikson determined that their crises ended at ages 25 and 30, respectively:

Erikson does note that the time of Identity crisis for persons of genius is frequently prolonged. He further notes that in our industrial society, identity formation tends to be long, because it takes us so long to gain the skills needed for adulthood&#x27;s tasks in our technological world. So… there is not exact time span in which to find oneself. It does not happen automatically at eighteen or at twenty-one. A &quot;very&quot; approximate rule of thumb for our society would put the end somewhere in one&#x27;s twenties.

===Love: intimacy vs. isolation (early adulthood, 20–45 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Love?
The Intimacy versus Isolation conflict occurs following adolescence. At the start of this stage, identity versus role confusion is coming to an end, although it still lingers at the foundation of the stage. The stage doesn&#x27;t always involve a romantic relationship but includes the strong bonds with others being formed. Young adults are still eager to blend their identities with those of their friends because they want to fit in. Erikson believes that people are sometimes isolated due to intimacy. People are afraid of rejections such as being turned down or their partners breaking up with them. Human beings are familiar with pain, and to some people, rejection is so painful that their egos cannot bear it. Erikson also argues that distantiation occurs with intimacy. Distantiation is the desire to isolate or destroy things that may be dangerous to one&#x27;s own ideals or life. This can occur if a person has their intimate relationship invaded by outsiders.

Once people have established their identities, they are ready to make long-term commitments to others. They become capable of forming intimate, reciprocal relationships (e.g. through close friendships or marriage) and willingly make the sacrifices and compromises that such relationships require. Those in more advanced stages of identity development are often associated with greater success pertaining to intimacy formation. If people cannot form these intimate relationships—perhaps because of their own needs—then a sense of isolation may result, thereby arousing feelings of darkness and angst.

Erikson’s documentation of his theory spends time considering intimacy between 2 people. The main conflict is whether an individual is willing to give themselves up to someone else. As suggested in the previous paragraphs, it seems that it could be very valuable for someone at this stage to let go of some of their fears in order to gain a solid relationship with another person. Erickson discusses the differences of his theory as compared to Freud’s theory of psychosexual development. Freud tended to focus more on sexual gratification without deep personal relationships being involved. Erikson’s proposal suggests that there is more to intimacy than sexual gratification. There is value in the deep bonds that can be shared between two people socially. Erikson, in his writing, does still discuss and see the value of sexual relations within a socially intimate relationship.

===Care: generativity vs. stagnation (middle adulthood, 45–64 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Make My Life Count?
Generativity is the concern of guiding the next generation. Socially-valued work and disciplines are expressions of generativity.

The adult stage of generativity has broad application to family, relationships, work, and society. &quot;Generativity, then is primarily the concern in establishing and guiding the next generation... the concept is meant to include... productivity and creativity.&quot;

During middle age, the primary developmental task is one of contributing to society and helping to guide future generations. When a person makes a contribution during this period, perhaps by raising a family or working toward the betterment of society, a sense of generativity—a sense of productivity and accomplishment—results. In contrast, a person who is self-centered and unable or unwilling to help society move forward develops a feeling of stagnation—a dissatisfaction with the relative lack of productivity. People in this stage consider what they are leaving behind for their posterity and community, as they are coming closer to the end of their life. The virtue that is related with this stage is care. In contrary, the maladaptive virtue is rejectivity.

As shared in the quote above, productivity and creativity are announced as being related to generativity. Despite this relation, Erikson hopes that those two words don’t take away from the main message. That message being that generativity is focusing on helping other people. Our society can sometimes hyperfixate on the idea that children need parents. Erikson shares and reinforces another view. Adults need children. The effort that is given to the children can help the adult become more mature. On top of that, as an adult is generative to youth, it can influence the children to return the favor when they grow up.

:Central tasks of middle adulthood
:*Express love through more than sexual contacts.
:* Maintain healthy life patterns.
:* Develop a sense of unity with mate.
:* Help growing and grown children to be responsible adults.
:* Relinquish central role in lives of grown children.
:* Accept children&#x27;s mates and friends.
:* Create a comfortable home.
:* Be proud of accomplishments of self and mate/spouse.
:* Reverse roles with aging parents.
:* Achieve mature, civic and social responsibility.
:* Adjust to physical changes of middle age.
:* Use leisure time creatively.

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair (late adulthood, 65 years and above)===
*Existential Question: Is it Okay to Have Been Me?
As people grow older and become senior citizens, they tend to slow down their productivity and explore life as a retired person. Factors such as leisure activities and family involvement play a significant role in the life of a retiree and their adjustment to living without having to perform specific duties each day pertaining to their career. Even during this stage of adulthood, however, they are still developing. The association between aging and retirement can bring about a reappearance of bipolar tensions of earlier stages in Erikson&#x27;s model, meaning that aspects of previous life stages can reactivate because of the onset of aging and retirement. Development at this stage also includes periods of reevaluation regarding life satisfaction, sustainment of active involvement, and developing a sense of health maintenance. Developmental conflicts may arise in this stage, but psychological growth in earlier stages can help significantly in resolving these conflicts.

It is during this time that they contemplate their accomplishments and evaluate the person that they have become. They are able to develop integrity if they see themselves as leading a successful life. Those that have developed integrity perceive that their lives have meaning. They tend to feel generally satisfied and accept themselves and others. As they near the end of their lives, they are more likely to be at peace about death. If they see their life as unproductive or feel that they did not accomplish their life goals, they become dissatisfied with life and develop despair. This can often lead to feelings of depression and hopelessness. They may also feel that life is unfair and be fearful of dying.

During this time there may be a renewal in interest in many things. This is believed to occur because the individuals in this time of life strive to be autonomous. As their bodies and minds start to deteriorate, they want to find a sense of balance. They will cling to their autonomy so that they will not need to be reliant on others for everything. Erikson explains that it is also important for adults in this stage to maintain relationships with others of different ages in order to develop integrity.

The final developmental task is retrospection: people look back on their lives and accomplishments. Practices such as narrative therapy can help individuals reinterpret their minds pertaining to their past and allow them to focus on the brighter aspects of their lives. They develop feelings of contentment and integrity if they believe that they have led a happy and productive life. If they look back on a life of disappointments and unachieved goals, they may instead develop a sense of despair.

This stage can occur out of the sequence when an individual feels they are near the end of their life (such as when receiving a terminal disease diagnosis).

When looking back on life, a person should hope to find both meaning and order. There are ways to alter or buoy one’s perspective during this stage. Altering or buoying one’s view could bring them closer to ego integrity. With that being said, it is better that a person has already carried out a life with meaning and order prior to beginning this stage.

Erikson ties this stage of development back into the first stage, trust vs mistrust. As shared by Erikson, the Webster dictionary once claimed that trust is “the assured reliance on another’s integrity”. One’s integrity could influence someone else’s trust. If a person at the end of their life fears death, then it could influence children to possibly fear life. If an adult is able to overcome any fears of death, then it can reinforce children to not be afraid of the life ahead of them.

===Ninth stage===
*Psychosocial Crises: All first eight stages in reverse quotient order
Joan Erikson, who married and collaborated with Erik Erikson, added a ninth stage in &quot;The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version&quot;. Living in the ninth stage, she wrote, &quot;old age in one&#x27;s eighties and nineties brings with it new demands, reevaluations, and daily difficulties&quot;. Addressing these new challenges requires &quot;designating a new ninth stage&quot;. Erikson was ninety-three years old when she wrote about the ninth stage.

Joan Erikson showed that all the eight stages &quot;are relevant and recurring in the ninth stage&quot;. In the ninth stage, the psychosocial crises of the eight stages are faced again, but with the quotient order reversed. For example, in the first stage (infancy), the psychosocial crisis was &quot;Trust vs. Mistrust&quot; with Trust being the &quot;syntonic quotient&quot; and Mistrust being the &quot;dystonic&quot;. Joan Erikson applies the earlier psychosocial crises to the ninth stage as follows:

&quot;Basic Mistrust vs. Trust: Hope&quot;
In the ninth stage, &quot;elders are forced to mistrust their own capabilities&quot; because one&#x27;s &quot;body inevitably weakens&quot;. Yet, Joan Erikson asserts that &quot;while there is light, there is hope&quot; for a &quot;bright light and revelation&quot;.

&quot;Shame and Doubt vs. Autonomy: Will&quot;
Ninth stage elders face the &quot;shame of lost control&quot; and doubt &quot;their autonomy over their own bodies&quot;. So it is that &quot;shame and doubt challenge cherished autonomy&quot;.

&quot;Inferiority vs. Industry: Competence&quot;
Industry as a &quot;driving force&quot; that elders once had is gone in the ninth stage. Being incompetent &quot;because of aging is belittling&quot; and makes elders &quot;like unhappy small children of great age&quot;.

&quot;Identity confusion vs. Identity: Fidelity&quot;
Elders experience confusion about their &quot;existential identity&quot; in the ninth stage and &quot;a real uncertainty about status and role&quot;.

&quot;Isolation vs. Intimacy: Love&quot;
In the ninth stage, the &quot;years of intimacy and love&quot; are often replaced by &quot;isolation and deprivation&quot;. Relationships become &quot;overshadowed by new incapacities and dependencies&quot;.

&quot;Stagnation vs. Generativity: Care&quot;
The generativity in the seventh stage of &quot;work and family relationships&quot;, if it goes satisfactorily, is &quot;a wonderful time to be alive&quot;. In one&#x27;s eighties and nineties, there is less energy for generativity or caretaking. Thus, &quot;a sense of stagnation may well take over&quot;.

&quot;Despair and Disgust vs. Integrity: Wisdom&quot;
Integrity imposes &quot;a serious demand on the senses of elders&quot;. Wisdom requires capacities that ninth stage elders &quot;do not usually have&quot;. The eighth stage includes retrospection that can evoke a &quot;degree of disgust and despair&quot;. In the ninth stage, introspection is replaced by the attention demanded to one&#x27;s &quot;loss of capacities and disintegration&quot;.

Living in the ninth stage, Joan Erikson expressed confidence that the psychosocial crisis of the ninth stage can be met as in the first stage with the &quot;basic trust&quot; with which &quot;we are blessed&quot;.

==Development of post-Freudian theory==
Erikson was a student of Anna Freud, the daughter of Sigmund Freud, whose psychoanalytic theory and psychosexual stages contributed to the basic outline of the eight stages, at least those concerned with childhood. Namely, the first four of Erikson&#x27;s life stages correspond to Freud&#x27;s oral, anal, phallic, and latency phases, respectively. Also, the fifth stage of adolescence is said to parallel the genital stage in psychosexual development:

Although the first three phases are linked to those of the Freudian theory, it can be seen that they are conceived along very different lines. Emphasis is not so much on sexual modes and their consequences, but on the ego qualities which emerge from each of the stages. There is an attempt also to link the sequence of individual development to the broader context of society.

Erikson saw a dynamic at work throughout life, one that did not stop at adolescence. He also viewed the life stages as a cycle: the end of one generation was the beginning of the next. Seen in its social context, the life stages were linear for an individual but circular for societal development:

In Freud&#x27;s view, development is largely complete by adolescence. In contrast, one of Freud&#x27;s students, Erik Erikson (1902–1994) believed that development continues throughout life. Erikson took the foundation laid by Freud and extended it through adulthood and into late life.
==Criticism==

One major criticism of Erikson&#x27;s theory of psychosocial development is that it primarily describes the development of European or American males. Erikson&#x27;s theory may be questioned as to whether his stages must be regarded as sequential, and only occurring within the age ranges he suggests. There is debate as to whether people only search for identity during the adolescent years or if one stage needs to happen before other stages can be completed. However, Erikson states that each of these processes occur throughout the lifetime in one form or another, and he emphasizes these &quot;phases&quot; only because it is at these times that the conflicts become most prominent.

Most empirical research into Erikson has related to his views on adolescence and attempts to establish identity. His theoretical approach was studied and supported, particularly regarding adolescence, by James E. Marcia. Marcia&#x27;s work has distinguished different forms of identity, and there is some empirical evidence that those people who form the most coherent self-concept in adolescence are those who are most able to make intimate attachments in early adulthood. This supports the part of Eriksonian theory, that suggests that those best equipped to resolve the crisis of early adulthood are those who have most successfully resolved the crisis of adolescence.

Erikson attributed the development of the stages to the presence of specific tensions which may be present at any moment of a person&#x27;s life. This causes another criticism of Erikson&#x27;s theory of psychosocial development: that Erikson does not go into detail about what causes these stages of development or how they are resolved. There is little information stated about the experiences that result in how a person develops at each stage. Just as there are vague details about the causes of each theory that does not outline the necessary steps to resolve conflict in order to enter the next stage.

<text>Elodie Lauten (October 20, 1950 – June 3, 2014) was a French-born American composer described as postminimalist or a microtonalist.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, France as Genevieve Schecroun, and educated in Paris at the Lycée Claude Monet, the Conservatoire (piano) and the Institut d’Etudes Politiques. Her father was Errol Parker (né Raphaël Schecroun), an Algerian-born jazz musician; her mother was a classical pianist.

Lauten was classically trained as a pianist since age 7. She contributed to the early punk-rock scene in Paris in 1975 and 1976. After relocating to New York City, she received a Master&#x27;s in composition from New York University where she studied Western composition with Dinu Ghezzo, and Indian classical music with Ahkmal Parwez. She became an American citizen in 1984. She received awards from the NEA, ASCAP, MTC, and the American Music Center, as well as chamber and orchestral commissions. 

A writer of operas, theater pieces, orchestral, chamber and instrumental music, she was recognized in North America and Europe as a pioneer of postminimalism and a force on the new music scene with over 20 releases on a number of labels including Lovely Music, Point/Polygram, 4-Tay, O.O. Discs, and New Tone (Italy).

==Musical style==
Lauten&#x27;s music was always a combination of two contradictory streams, one a cloudy, beatless stasis derived from minimalism, the other a neoclassical attachment to tonal melody and ostinato. These two were present from the beginning of her recording career, the first in her &quot;Concerto for Piano and Orchestral Memory&quot; (1984), the second in her &quot;Sonata Ordinaire&quot; (1986) for piano.

Her 1987 opera &quot;The Death of Don Juan&quot;—feminist tract and Zen meditation combined—was one of the major postminimalist works of the 1980s; it was revived in April 2005 at Franklin Pierce College (in New Hampshire), directed by Robert Lawson. Her neoclassical tendency blossomed into a full neo-baroque idiom in her &quot;Deus ex Machina&quot; Cycle for voices and Baroque ensemble (1999). &quot;Variations On The Orange Cycle&quot; (1991, recorded by Lois Svard for Lovely Music in 1998) is one of the cloudier works, an improvisation in a Terry Riley-ish vein that was recorded and transcribed (as few of her piano works have been) for performance by others. Svard&#x27;s recording of the work was included in Frank J. Oteri&#x27;s &quot;The Century List: 100 Reasons to Play This Century&#x27;s Music&quot;, a list of 100 recommended recordings for classic radio programmers distributed at the 1998 Music Personnel in Public Radio conference and subsequently published in &quot;Chamber Music&quot; magazine in 1999.

Lauten&#x27;s opera &quot;Waking in New York&quot;, written on poems by her late friend Allen Ginsberg, was presented by the New York City Opera VOX and Friends 2004, after being released on 4Tay in 2003. Smoothly suave but with a gentle rock beat, the work pioneered a mixture of genres by combining vocal soloists from three styles: classical, Broadway, and gospel. &quot;OrfReo&quot;, an opera for Baroque ensemble, was premiered at Merkin Hall by the Queen&#x27;s Chamber Band, who also included Lauten&#x27;s &quot;The Architect&quot; in their CD New Music Alive (Capstone, 2004). &quot;OrfReo&quot; was released on CD in December 2004 (Studio 21). In 2004, she was composer-in-residence at Hope College (in Michigan). Her &quot;Symphony 2001&quot; was premiered in February 2003 by the SEM Orchestra in New York.

Lauten was the 2014 recipient of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts&#x27; Robert Rauschenberg Award.

==Personal life==
Genevieve adopted the name &quot;Elodie&quot; after moving to the United States and took the surname Lauten from her first husband. That marriage ended in divorce, as did her second, to Carl Karas. She had no children.

==Death==
Lauten died in Beth Israel Hospital, Manhattan, aged 63, from cancer.

<doc id="1058804" wikidata="Q6307768" url="?curid=1058804" title="The Twin Dilemma">
<text>The Twin Dilemma is the seventh and final serial of the 21st season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four twice-weekly parts from 22 to 30 March 1984. It was directed by Peter Moffat and written by Anthony Stevens. The serial stars Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant as the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown, respectively. &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was the first to star Baker. 

The serial follows the Doctor immediately after regenerating as he works to prevent the alien gastropod Mestor (Edwin Richfield) from plotting to explode the sun of the planet Jaconda to scatter his eggs throughout the universe to conquer it.

&quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was critically panned with both the writing and direction being heavily criticized, though Baker&#x27;s performance did receive some praise. It received a novelisaiton written by Eric Saward which was later adapted into an audiobook. The serial averaged million viewers per episode, down slightly from the previous story.

== Plot ==
As a result of his recent regeneration, the Sixth Doctor suffers from mood swings and violent delusions, culminating in his attempt to strangle his companion, Peri Brown. Realising the threat he could pose to the universe in this state, the Doctor decides to exile himself and Peri to a remote asteroid Titan 3. Meanwhile, the mysterious Professor Edgeworth abducts two teenaged math geniuses, Romulus and Remus Sylvest, at the behest of Mestor, the leader of the slug-like Gastropods who have usurped Edgeworth as ruler of the planet Jaconda. Mestor orders Edgeworth to hide on Titan 3, and destroys a pursuing squad of fighters.

The only survivor of the fighter squadron is Lieutenant Hugo Lang, who crash-lands near the TARDIS. The Doctor saves Hugo at Peri&#x27;s behest, and he and Peri investigate the asteroid, leading to them being captured by Edgeworth. The Doctor recognises that &quot;Edgeworth&quot; is actually Azmael, a fellow Time Lord and his former tutor. Azmael tries to strand the Doctor and Peri on Titan 3, but unbeknownst to Azmael, his assistant Noma arms a bomb intended to kill them both, and they narrowly escape with their lives.

The Doctor, Peri, and Hugo follow Azmael to the now-desolate Jaconda, where Azmael makes it clear he never intended for them to be harmed, and reveals that Mestor is forcing him to have Romulus and Remus create calculations which will terraform two nearby planets that the Gastropods can settle on. The Doctor, however, realizes that Mestor has lied to Azmael about the nature of his plan, and the calculations will actually cause Jaconda&#x27;s sun to go supernova, allowing Gastropod eggs to infest the galaxy. 

After the Doctor tries and fails to kill him, Mestor announces that he will take over the Doctor&#x27;s body. The Doctor tries to goad Mestor into doing this, but he instead takes over Azmael. The more experienced Azmael manages to briefly retake control of his body and initiates a regeneration, but since he has used up his entire regeneration cycle, this has the effect of killing both himself and Mestor, though Azmael and the Doctor make amends before the former dies. Hugo decides to stay on Jaconda and become its new ruler, while the Doctor agrees to return Romulus and Remus to their parents. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS, faces the camera and states, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; the Doctor, whether you like it or not!&quot;

== Production ==
=== Development and filming ===
The reason for producer John Nathan-Turner&#x27;s decision to place &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; at the end of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; season 21 was out of a desire to introduce the new Doctor as fast as possible. The serial was developed under the working title &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot;. Nathan-Turner wanted the serial to be &quot;simplistic&quot;, while script editor Eric Saward wanted it to be elaborate and complicated.

The serial was directed by Peter Moffatt. Moffatt later stated that &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was one of his worst serials and that he did a terrible job. Moffatt shot as much of the serial as possible in chronological order. The first block of filming began on 24 January 1984, and ran for three days. The second block started on 7 February and ran for two days. The third and final block began on 14 February and ran for 3 days. The entirety of the first and third blocks were shot in studios 8 and 3 of the BBC Television Centre respectively. The scenes for Titan 3 were shot at Springwell Quarry in Hertfordshire and the scenes for Jaconda were shot at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

=== Writing ===
&quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was written by Anthony Steven. Nathan-Turner had previously worked with Steven on the drama series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. Steven struggled to meet deadlines for the serial leading to several delays. Shortly after completing the script Steven became sick and unable to perform rewrites, leading Saward to completely rewrite the second half of the serial. Saward cut several major story beats including a speech the Doctor would give to Azmeal and the Doctor promising to return to Jaconda.

Throughout the serial The Doctor is unusually violent, even attempting to strangle Peri. The intention was to create a Doctor that was initially unlikeable, but would grow to become beloved by the audience. This was intended to be in contrast with the more likable Fifth Doctor. During the 2003 documentary &quot;The Story of Doctor Who&quot; Baker revealed that the original plan was &quot;over the many, many years I would be playing the part, the outer layers would gradually peel away, revealing the kind-hearted soul.&quot;

=== Casting ===

Nicola Bryant returns from the previous serial as Peri Brown. Colin Baker makes his first full appearance as the Sixth Doctor. Prior to being cast, various media outlets had suggested Baker should be the one to replace Peter Davison as the next Doctor. Baker, a fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, had expressed interest and previously considered auditioning for the role of the Fourth Doctor. However, due to Baker&#x27;s casting as Commander Maxil in &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot; he assumed he would be ineligible for the role. On 10 June 1983, during a meeting with the production team, Baker was formally offered the role by Nathan-Turner. He accepted and signed a four year contract.

Edwin Richfield portrayed Mestor, the serial&#x27;s primary antagonist. Richfield had previously appeared as Captain Hart in the 1972 serial &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;. Kevin McNally was cast as Lieutenant Hugo Lang. McNally had been a fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as a child.

When casting the titular twins Moffat had intended to cast a pair of girls, but Nathan-Turner insisted that the twins should be male. Moffat instead selected Andrew and Paul Conrad, children of Les Conrad who had served as an extra in several past serials. Les appeared in &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; as a Jacondan guard.

=== Costuming ===
For the first half of &quot;Part One&quot; both Baker and Bryant wore the same costumes the Doctor and Peri wore in &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; before changing into new outfits. Baker suggested that the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s outfit should be a black suit. Nathan-Turner rejected it as he wanted the Doctor to wear something &quot;totally tasteless&quot;. Peri&#x27;s new outfit was originally a blue trouser suit, however Nathan-Turner opposed this as he felt she should wear something more revealing.

The cat badge worn by the Sixth Doctor on his lapel for this story was handmade and painted by Suzie Trevor and purchased for the programme from a specialist badge shop in Central London. Baker suggested that in each subsequent story, the Doctor should wear a different cat badge to symbolise his mood.

== Release ==

=== Ratings ===
&quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was released on BBC1 in four twice-weekly parts from 22 to 30 March 1984. &quot;Part One&quot; was released to an audience of 7.6 million viewers, making it the highest viewed episode. It was followed by the second highest viewed, &quot;Part Two&quot;, with only 7.4 million. Parts three and four were viewed by 7.0 and 6.3 million viewers, respectively. Audience Appreciation Index were taken for the episodes, the best rated episode was &quot;Part Four&quot; with a 67 and the lowest was &quot;Part Three&quot; with a 59. The serial averaged million viewers per episode. &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; averaged 180 thousand less viewers than the previous serial.

=== Reception ===
&quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was panned by both critics and fans. Where the previous serial, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, is frequently cast among the very best of all &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; is often regarded as one of the very worst in the history of the series. Despite the overwhelmingly negative reception for the serial, Baker&#x27;s performance was somewhat praised. Writing for &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, Andrew Blair felt that the quality of the serial partially devalued the ending of &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker review of the story in &quot;Doctor Who: The Television Companion&quot; describes &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; as &quot;painful to watch&quot;, feeling that the Doctor&#x27;s erratic behaviour was &quot;forced and artificial, and succeed[s] only in alienating the viewer.&quot; The review also argues the script &quot;leaves much to be desired&quot; and that the direction is uninteresting, giving the whole story &quot;a rather tacky, B-movie feel to it&quot;.

In the 150th issue of &quot;SFX magazine&quot; Russell T Davies, producer of the 2005 revival, cites the story as &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Tat Wood and Lawrence Miles, reviewing the story for their book, &quot;About Time&quot;, noted that the divide in quality between &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; and &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; &quot;felt wrong at the time, and still feels wrong now&quot;. The pair wrote, &quot;How could anyone have thought that this story, of juvenile space monsters, meaningless plans and never-ending cop-outs, was ever workable?&quot;. Writing for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Patrick Mulkern heavily criticized the serial along with the new Doctor. Mulkern disliked the episode&#x27;s villains finding them dull and boring. Though he did praise Baker&#x27;s performance stating that the main problems were the writing and the direction. &quot;Digital Spy&quot; Morgan Jeffery also criticized the direction calling it &quot;unusually flat&quot; for Moffat.

A 1998 poll by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; ranked the serial the second worst of all time only ahead of the Children in Need special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;. In 2009, another &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; poll of the 200 stories produced up to that point saw the serial finish in last place, along with finishing last in every single age group that voted.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Saward, was published in hardback by Target Books in September 1985, and in paperback in March 1986. The cover illustration originally featured Colin Baker; however, when Baker&#x27;s agent enquired about a royalty, the decision was taken to not feature him on the cover and a replacement was commissioned.

In January 2012, an audiobook version of the novelisation was released. It read by Baker.

===Home media===
&quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; was released on VHS in May 1992. The tape was available exclusively through Woolworths as part of a special promotion. A general release followed in February 1993.

Behind the scenes footage of the serial was released along with various other Sixth Doctor stories the most prominent being the 2008 release of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;.

The serial was released on DVD on 7 September 2009. Despite being the first Sixth Doctor story it was the last to be released on DVD. It was later re-released as part of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD Files in Issue 127 on 13 November 2013.

<text>Lake Clark (Denaʼina: &quot;Qizhjeh Vena&quot;) is a lake in southwest Alaska. It drains through Six Mile Lake and the Newhalen River into Iliamna Lake. The lake is about long and about wide.

Lake Clark was named for John W. Clark, chief of the Nushagak trading post and the first American non-Native to see the lake, when an expedition financed by a weekly magazine reached it in February 1891. The Dena&#x27;ina Athabascan name is &quot;Qizjeh Vena&quot; which means &quot;place where people gather lake&quot;. The lake is within Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.

<doc id="1058810" wikidata="Q6776185" url="?curid=1058810" title="University of Tennessee Southern">
<text>The University of Tennessee Southern (UT Southern or UTS) is a public university in Pulaski, Tennessee. Founded in 1870, it was a private institution for over 150 years until joining the University of Tennessee System in 2021. It was renamed and became the first new primary campus in the University of Tennessee System in over 50 years. The name University of Tennessee Southern was chosen because the campus serves the 13 counties of southern Middle Tennessee.

==History==
UT Southern was originally founded as Martin Methodist College in 1870. The college was named for Thomas Martin (1799–1870), former mayor of Pulaski, who left in his will an endowment of $30,000 to establish a college for the education of the white girls and women of Giles County. It is sometimes suggested that Martin did so in fulfilment of a promise to his daughter Victoria, who died at the age of twenty. In 1938, the college became coeducational. Originally founded as a whites-only institution, in 1966 it became racially integrated. The college was originally named Martin Female College until 1908, when its name was changed to Martin College. Then, in April 1986, it became Martin Methodist College after becoming a private institution affiliated with the United Methodist Church. In July 2021, the campus was purchased by the University of Tennessee System and was converted to a public four-year institution.

==Athletics==
The UT Southern athletic teams are called the Firehawks (previously they were known as the RedHawks before the UT system merger). The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC) on its second stint since the 2023–24 academic year. The Firehawks had previously competed as members of the SSAC on its first tenure from 2013–14 to 2019–20, until briefly joining the Mid-South Conference (MSC) from 2020–21 to 2022–23. They also competed in the (now defunct) TranSouth Athletic Conference (TSAC) from 1996–97 to 2012–13, and in the Tennessee Collegiate Athletic Conference (TCAC) from 1986–87 to 1995–96.

UT Southern competes in 19 intercollegiate varsity teams: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track and field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Competitive cheerleading and competitive clay target shooting are offered as a co-ed sports. Former sports included men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bowling

===Accomplishments===
Athletic teams at UT Southern have won 12 national championships:

* Men&#x27;s Soccer – NAIA National Champions (2013)
* Women&#x27;s Soccer – Three-time NAIA National Champions (2005, 2007, 2021).

<doc id="1058812" wikidata="Q1839945" url="?curid=1058812" title="Hare quota">
<text>The [[Hare quota|Hare]] quota (sometimes called the simple, ideal, or [[Hare quota|Hamilton]] quota) is the number of voters represented by each legislator in an idealized system of proportional representation where every vote is used to elect someone. The Hare quota is equal to the number of votes divided by the number of seats.

The Hare quota was used in Thomas Hare&#x27;s proposal for a single transferable vote system and can still be used for this purpose, though the Droop quota is used for most STV elections today. The Hare quota is often used to set electoral thresholds and to calculate apportionments under party-list proportional representation when using the largest remainder method. In such cases, the Hare quota gives unbiased apportionments that do not favor either large or small parties. However, unlike Droop&#x27;s quota, the Hare quota does not guarantee a party with a majority of votes in the district will win at least half the seats.

The quota was first proposed by Alexander Hamilton for use in United States congressional apportionment, as part of what is now called Hamilton&#x27;s method.

==Formula==
The Hare quota may be given as:

:formula_1
where
*Total votes = the total valid poll; that is, the number of valid (unspoilt) votes cast in an election.
*Total seats = the total number of seats to be filled in the election.

== Use in STV ==
In an STV election a candidate who reaches the quota is elected while any votes a candidate receives above the quota in many cases have the opportunity to be transferred to another candidate in accordance to the voter&#x27;s next usable marked preference. Thus the quota is used both to determine who is elected and to determine the number of surplus votes when a person is elected with quota. When the Droop quota is used, often about a quota of votes are not used to elect anyone (a much lower proportion that under the first-past-the-post voting system) so the quota is a cue to the number of votes that are used to actually elect someone.

The Hare quota was devised by Thomas Hare, one of the first to work out a complete STV system. In 1868, Henry Richmond Droop (1831–1884) invented the Droop quota as an alternative to the Hare quota. The Hare quota today is rarely used with STV due to fact that Droop is considered more fair to both large parties and small parties. 

The number of votes in the quota is determined by the district magnitude of the district in conjunction with the number of valid votes cast.

=== Example ===
To see how the Hare quota works in an STV election, imagine an election in which there are two seats to be filled and three candidates: Andrea, Brad, and Carter. One hundred voters voted, each casting one vote and marking a back-up preference, to be used only in case the first preference candidate is un-electable or elected with surplus. There are 100 ballots showing preferences as follows:

Because there are 100 voters and 2 seats, the Hare quota is:

:formula_2

To begin the count the first preferences cast for each candidate are tallied and are as follows:

*Andrea: 60
*Brad: 26
*Carter: 14

Andrea has reached the quota and is declared elected. She has 10 votes more than the quota so these votes are transferred to Carter, as specified on the ballots. The tallies of the remaining candidates therefore now become:

*Brad: 26
*Carter: 24

At this stage, there are only two candidates remaining and one seat open. The most-popular candidate is declared elected; the other is declared defeated.

Although Brad has not reached the quota, he is declared elected since he has more votes than Carter.

The winners are therefore Andrea and Brad.

== Use in party-list PR ==
Hong Kong and Brazil use the Hare quota in largest-remainder systems.

In Brazil&#x27;s largest remainder system the Hare quota is used to set the basic number of seats allocated to each party or coalition. Any remaining seats are allocated according to the D&#x27;Hondt method. This procedure is used for the Federal Chamber of Deputies, State Assemblies, Municipal and Federal District Chambers.

=== In Hong Kong ===
For geographical constituencies, the SAR government adopted weakly-proportional representation using the largest remainder method with Hare quota in 1997. Typically, largest remainders paired with the Hare quota produces unbiased results that are difficult to manipulate. However, the combination of extremely small districts, no electoral thresholds, and low led to a system that parties could manipulate using careful vote management.

By running candidates on separate tickets, Hong Kong parties aimed to ensure they received no seats in the first step of apportionment, but still received enough votes to take several of the remainder seats when running against a divided opposition. The Democratic Party, for example, filled three separate tickets in the 8-seat New Territories West constituency in the 2008 Legislative Council elections. In the 2012 election, no candidate list won more than one seat in any of the six PR constituencies (a total of 40 seats). In Hong Kong, the Hare quota has effectively created a multi-member single-vote system in the territory.

== Mathematical properties ==
In situations where parties&#x27; total share of the vote varies randomly, the Hare quota is the unique unbiased quota for an electoral system based on vote-transfers or quotas. However, if the quota is used in small constituencies with no electoral threshold, it is possible to manipulate the system by running several candidates on separate lists, allowing each to win a remainder seat with less than a full quota. This can make the method behave like the single non-transferable vote in practice, as has happened in Hong Kong. By contrast, rules based on the Droop quota cannot be manipulated in the same way, as it is never possible for a party to gain seats by splitting.

<doc id="1058814" wikidata="Q799090" url="?curid=1058814" title="Dick Atkin, Baron Atkin">
<text>James Richard Atkin, Baron Atkin, (28 November 1867 – 25 June 1944), commonly known as Dick Atkin, was an Australian-British jurist, who served as a lord of appeal in ordinary from 1928 until his death in 1944. He is especially remembered as the judge giving the leading judgement in the case of &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; in 1932, in which he established the modern law of negligence in the UK, and indirectly in most of the common law world.

==Early life and practice==

Atkin was the son of Robert Travers Atkin (1841–1872) and his wife, Mary Elizabeth &quot;née&quot; Ruck (1842–1920). Robert was from Kilgarriff, County Cork, Mary&#x27;s father from Newington, Kent, and her mother from Merioneth, Wales. The couple married in 1864 and soon emigrated to Australia intending to take up sheep farming. However, little more than a year into their enterprise Robert was badly injured in a fall from a horse and the couple moved to Brisbane where Robert became a journalist and politician. He always thought of himself as a Welshman, and was President of the London Welsh Trust from 1938 to 1944.

James was born at &quot;Ellandale&quot; cottage, Tank Street, off North Quay, Brisbane, the eldest of three sons but in 1871, his mother brought him and his siblings back to her own mother&#x27;s house, &quot;Pantlludw&quot; on the River Dovey in Wales. His father died in Brisbane in the following year. James was much influenced by his grandmother and acquired from her an egalitarian instinct and a distaste for sanctimonious posturing. His mother&#x27;s sister, Amy, was the first wife of Francis Darwin, third son of Charles Darwin (1809–1882) and his wife Emma: there is a thank-you letter extant to Charles Darwin from the eleven-year-old Dick.

Atkin attended Friars School, Bangor, and Christ College, Brecon, and won a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read classics and &quot;literae humaniores&quot;, enjoying playing tennis in his leisure time. Atkin was called to the bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1891 and scoured the London law courts assessing the quality of the advocates so as to decide where to apply for pupillage. He was ultimately impressed by Thomas Scrutton and became his pupil, joining fellow pupils Frank MacKinnon, a future Lord Justice of Appeal, and Robert Wright, another future Law Lord. He took chambers at 3 Pump Court but, as did most beginning barristers at the time, struggled to find work. He shared living accommodation with Arthur Hughes who later married Mary Vivian Hughes whose book &quot;A London Family 1870–1900&quot; mentions Atkin. He eventually established a practice in commercial law, in particular in work on behalf of the London Stock Exchange, and became known as a subtle advocate with no need to rely on theatrical effects. His practice grew from about 1900 and made a favourable impression when appearing before the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom H. H. Asquith who was sitting as an arbitrator. Asquith was so impressed that he secured a pupillage for his own son Raymond at Atkin&#x27;s chambers. By 1906, &quot;The Times&quot; considered him probably the busiest junior at the Bar. In that year Atkin took silk. Once John Hamilton was made a judge in 1909 and Scrutton in 1910, Atkin dominated the commercial Bar.

==Judge==

He became a judge of the King&#x27;s Bench division of the High Court in 1913, receiving a knighthood. Work at the King&#x27;s Bench involved him in criminal cases which had been outside his experience as a barrister but he established a high reputation as a criminal judge. Reputedly, Atkin enjoyed his six years at the King&#x27;s Bench more than any others of his legal career. The following nine at the Court of Appeal he enjoyed the least.

Atkin became a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1919. In the 1920 case of &quot;Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd&quot; Atkin showed his disapproval of unjustified restriction on civil liberties by holding (&quot;obiter&quot;) that a person could sue for false imprisonment even under circumstances where he had been unaware of his imprisonment at the time. Again in 1920, in &quot;Everett v Griffiths&quot;, Atkin held that Everett was owed a duty of care by a Board of Guardians who had detained him as insane on inadequate grounds. However, Lord Justices Scrutton and Bankes held otherwise and their majority prevailed over Atkin&#x27;s dissenting judgment.

From 1928 until his death he was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary under the title Baron Atkin, &quot;of Aberdovey, in the County of Merioneth&quot;.

An Anglican, Atkin was strongly motivated by his Christian faith and relied on testing the law against the demands of common sense and the interests of the ordinary working man. He came to a settled view early on in hearing a case and, as a Law Lord, his colleagues often found him indefatigable in his opinions and difficult to persuade as to the merits of alternative views.

===&quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;===
In 1932, as a member of the House of Lords, he delivered the leading judgment in the landmark case of &quot;Donoghue v. Stevenson&quot; concerning the alleged adverse effects from an alleged snail in a bottle of ginger beer served in a café in Paisley. The case established the modern law of negligence in the UK and, indirectly, in most of the rest of the common law world, with the major exception of the United States.

===&quot;Liversidge v. Anderson&quot;===
He is also remembered for his dissenting judgment in &quot;Liversidge v Anderson&quot;, in which he unsuccessfully asserted the courts&#x27; right to question the wide discretionary powers of the Home Secretary to detain subjects suspected of having &#x27;hostile associations&#x27;.

===Commercial law===

He also gave the leading judgment in &quot;Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.&quot;, , still the leading authority on common mistake under English law.

==Gray&#x27;s Inn==

The Inn had been at a low ebb when Atkin joined. It was impoverished, its dinners and functions poorly attended and its benchers lacking professional prestige. It was largely through Atkin&#x27;s efforts, and those of F.E. Smith, that the Inn&#x27;s prestige was restored. Atkin was himself three times Treasurer, Master of the Library and Master of Moots.

==Later life==

Lucy Elizabeth (Lizzie) Hemmant (1867–1939) was the daughter of William Hemmant, a friend of Atkin&#x27;s father from Brisbane. She had been born within 12 days and within of Atkin. William also subsequently moved to London and was important in helping Atkin to establish his stock exchange contacts. Atkin married Lizzie Hemmant in 1893 after five years&#x27; engagement.

The couple had six daughters and two sons, the elder son being killed in World War I. Atkin&#x27;s daughter Rosaline became a barrister of Gray&#x27;s Inn. The fourth daughter, Nancy, to her father&#x27;s delight, became an actress. Nancy made her debut in Liverpool and was discovered and brought to London by Charles Hawtrey and A. A. Milne. Atkin&#x27;s grandson, by his daughter Lucy Atkin, was the politician and business leader Sir Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington.

Atkin enjoyed the music hall and in particular the humour of George Robey and Marie Lloyd. He and his wife were fond of entertaining at their succession of town homes in Kensington with musical evenings. In 1912 Atkin realised his ambition of buying a house &quot;Craig-y-Don&quot; in Aberdovey and from that time, he spent every summer there with his family. At Aberdovey, Atkin enjoyed tennis, golf and bridge. He was an enthusiast for the literary works of Edgar Wallace. Atkin was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the London Welsh Centre, Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, from 1938 until 1944. Atkin was popular with the community in Aberdovey and was paraded into the village on a hand-drawn cab on his appointment to the High Court. When possible, he sat as a Justice of the Peace in Towyn and Machynlleth, and eventually chaired Merionethshire Quarter Sessions.

He died of bronchitis in Aberdyfi where he was buried.

<doc id="1058821" wikidata="Q884137" url="?curid=1058821" title="Blind Illusion">
<text>Blind Illusion is an American progressive thrash metal band from Richmond, California. The band’s original line-up formed in 1978 by lead guitarist and songwriter Mark Biedermann. Since Blind Illusion’s inception the band has had several line-up changes, with Biedermann remaining the only constant member. Blind Illusion is also notable for featuring Les Claypool and Larry LaLonde, both later of Primus, who performed bass and guitar respectively on their 1988 debut album &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot;. 

After a 20-year hiatus, Biedermann reformed Blind Illusion in 2009, and they have since released two more albums: &quot;Demon Master&quot; (2010) and &quot;Wrath of the Gods&quot; (2022). They also released an EP in February 2019, titled &quot;2018&quot;, which also includes remakes of some of their older songs.

==History==
Blind Illusion was formed in 1978 by De Anza High School students Mark Biedermann, on guitar and vocals, Les Claypool, on bass, and Bret Hern, on drums. By that time, Biedermann had been writing his own music from a young age, and original songs were a priority for the new band from the beginning. The band&#x27;s earliest sound was musically rooted in progressive rock, with Biedermann citing as his main inspirations Rush, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Scorpions, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Frank Marino, Black Sabbath, and Blue Öyster Cult. They soon added vocalist David White. Claypool left the band in 1979 and was replaced by bassist Chris Olsen. This line-up would play outdoor parties and self promoted multi-band concerts around the area since all of the members were too young to play in clubs. They also recorded several demo songs during this period. Brian Kehoe joined as a second guitarist and Les Claypool returned as well to record another demo tape of the songs &quot;On Death&#x27;s Bed&quot; and &quot;Kamikaze&quot; in 1980.

By 1983, Blind Illusion were making inroads into the same venues that featured many bands in the developing Bay Area thrash scene. By this time, Biedermann and White were joined by Craig Maracich on bass, Evan McCaskey on guitar, Vic Griffith on drums and Ben Heveroh on keyboards. This version recorded another demo tape and was fairly stable for a time, but the band was beset by line-up changes going forward.

The 1985 version of the band (Biedermann, White, Gene Gilson on bass, Mike Miner on drums) recorded the &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; demo which was produced by Biedermann&#x27;s old classmate, Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett. Soon after, David White would leave to join Heathen and Biedermann took over on vocals.

In 1986, after an additional demo produced by Hammett, which included his guitar tech John Marshall on 2nd guitar, Hammett brought the band to the attention of Mark Palmer at Music for Nations in England who signed Blind Illusion to a recording contract. By 1987, Gilson had left the band and Les Claypool re-joined for a third time while on a break from his band Primus. Before the recording of the album began, John Marshall left to join Metal Church and was replaced by ex-Possessed guitarist Larry LaLonde. 

Recording of the album commenced at Hyde Street Studios with Kirk Hammett producing. At the same time in the adjacent Alpha and Omega Studios, Blue Öyster Cult were recording their Imaginos album. BOC manager/producer/lyricist Sandy Pearlman heard Biedermann&#x27;s playing and asked if he would like to guest on the album. Biedermann ultimately appears on several songs on the album alongside notable guitarists such as Joe Satriani and The Doors Robbie Krieger. In lieu of payment for his contributions to the album, Biedermann bartered for studio time to mix the Blind Illusion album, since they had spent all of their advance money by that point. The resulting debut album &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot; was released in the spring of 1988 on Combat Records in the US and Music For Nations affiliate label Under One Flag in Europe. While Hammett did in fact produce the album, he is not credited as such because of Metallica management requiring payment to use his name, which Biedermann declined. The band embarked on a US tour to promote the release with Hallows Eve and At War. Halfway through the tour, Claypool returned to Primus and was replaced by Adam Gates for the remainder of the tour. After the band returned home in 1989, LaLonde also left the band to join Claypool in Primus.

Blind Illusion then signed a recording contract with CBS Records and Biedermann brought in Vern Mc Elroy on bass, Wes Anderson on drums, and Mark Strausburgh on guitar. The band began recording their second album titled &quot;The Medicine Show&quot; but the project was shelved, and Blind Illusion disbanded shortly after when their contract with CBS was declared null and void after Sony bought out CBS and dropped several acts from the label.

Mark Biedermann briefly played bass for Heathen on their &quot;Victims of Deception&quot; album in 1991.

Biedermann left the music business behind and taught Shaolin Kung-Fu at the Buddhist Monastery City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Talmage Ca. It was at this time in 1999 that he discovered the name The Ghost Kings in a Buddhist sutra &quot;The Past lives of Earth Store Boddhissattva&quot; which he used as the name for his Southern Rock project. Biedermann wrote upwards of 35 classic Southern rock / Country songs including &quot;King Hobo Dirt Road Okie&quot; and &quot;Ghost Kings&quot; with his musical partner, rhythm guitarist/vocalist &quot;Scary&quot; Eric Lagosh.

After a roughly 20-year hiatus, Biedermann reformed Blind Illusion in 2009 with a new-lineup of Danny Harcourt on guitar and Robert Nystrom on drums, releasing their second studio album &quot;Demon Master&quot; on July 7, 2010. The album marked a very different style and sound from &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot;, going in a more traditional progressive/stoner rock direction. In September 2010, the group promoted the album at the Sobrante Stroll, a street fair held every year in El Sobrante since 1991. Before reuniting Blind Illusion, Biedermann had performed earlier shows at the Sobrante Stroll as well as at the older and much larger Solano Stroll fair in Berkeley. The material Biedermann covered included a mix of Blind Illusion originals and blues rock collaborations with other local musicians.

In December 2013, Biedermann met D.R.I. bassist Harald Oimoen in Berkeley, and Oimoen convinced Biedermann to return to the Sane Asylum sound that Blind Illusion were most associated with, and join with him and drummer Erik &quot;Cire&quot; Cruze from early East Bay Thrashers &quot;Terminal Shock&quot;. These sessions were the catalyst for Biedermann to forge ahead in the classic Blind Illusion style. Biedermann eventually teamed up with former Heathen guitarist Doug Piercy and bassist Tom Gears to record the four track EP &quot;2018&quot;. The band has played several European shows since. 

In August 2020, Blind Illusion announced that they were in the studio recording their third album, entitled &quot;Wrath Of The Gods&quot; which included former Death Angel drummer Andy Galeon. The album was released on October 7, 2022.

Blind Illusion is currently working on new material for their fourth studio album, titled &quot;Crushing the Universe&quot;, which is due for release later in 2024 or 2025.

<text>The London Musicians Collective (LMC) is a cultural charity based in London, England devoted to the support and promotion of contemporary, experimental and improvised music.

From its foundation in 1975 until its reorganization in 2009, the LMC organized concerts, festivals, tours, workshops and publications in support of experimental music.

The LMC grew from &quot;Musics&quot; and had overlapping membership. It had some of the same approach to division of labour as the magazine. While the latter chose financial independence, the LMC at its first meeting rejected this policy by 37 votes to 1. The LMC then applied to the Arts Council of Great Britain for funding.

Two LPs were produced, numbered LMC1 and LMC2, but they were independent productions not directly initiated by the main collective.

In 2002, the LMC was awarded a community radio licence to broadcast a new radio station, Resonance FM, in central London. It also produced a magazine, &quot;Resonance&quot;, and a range of CDs, including &quot;Your Favourite London Sounds&quot; in 2001, compiled by Peter Cusack.

The LMC is funded by donations, membership fees and grants. It was supported by Arts Council England until its funding was cut in 2008. 

After the LMC ceased its initial programme of activities in 2008 the contents of its office were archived by CRiSAP (Creative Research in Sound Arts Practice) at the London College of Communication, University of the Arts London in 2009.

An online exhibition &quot;Sound Traces&quot;, curated by LMC co-founder David Toop for CriSAP, explored the legacy of LMC activities from 1975–2008. This ran from 2009 until April 2023 and an archive record of the exhibition is in preparation for late 2023.

<doc id="1058833" wikidata="Q1780921" url="?curid=1058833" title="Orthogonal complement">
<text>In the mathematical fields of linear algebra and functional analysis, the orthogonal complement of a subspace formula_1 of a vector space formula_2 equipped with a bilinear form formula_3 is the set formula_4 of all vectors in formula_2 that are orthogonal to every vector in formula_1. Informally, it is called the perp, short for perpendicular complement. It is a subspace of formula_2.

==Example==

Let formula_8 be the vector space equipped with the usual dot product formula_9 (thus making it an inner product space), and let formula_10 with
formula_11
then its orthogonal complement formula_12 can also be defined as formula_13 being
formula_14

The fact that every column vector in formula_15 is orthogonal to every column vector in formula_16 can be checked by direct computation. The fact that the spans of these vectors are orthogonal then follows by bilinearity of the dot product. Finally, the fact that these spaces are orthogonal complements follows from the dimension relationships given below.

== General bilinear forms ==
Let formula_2 be a vector space over a field formula_18 equipped with a bilinear form formula_19 We define formula_20 to be left-orthogonal to formula_21, and formula_21 to be right-orthogonal to formula_20, when formula_24 For a subset formula_1 of formula_26 define the left-orthogonal complement formula_4 to be
formula_28

There is a corresponding definition of the right-orthogonal complement. For a reflexive bilinear form, where formula_29, the left and right complements coincide. This will be the case if formula_3 is a symmetric or an alternating form.

The definition extends to a bilinear form on a free module over a commutative ring, and to a sesquilinear form extended to include any free module over a commutative ring with conjugation.

=== Properties ===
* An orthogonal complement is a subspace of formula_2;
* If formula_32 then formula_33;
* The radical formula_34 of formula_2 is a subspace of every orthogonal complement;
* formula_36;
* If formula_3 is non-degenerate and formula_2 is finite-dimensional, then formula_39.
* If formula_40 are subspaces of a finite-dimensional space formula_2 and formula_42 then formula_43.

== Inner product spaces ==
This section considers orthogonal complements in an inner product space formula_44.

Two vectors formula_45 and formula_46 are called if formula_47, which happens if and only if formula_48 scalars formula_49.

If formula_50 is any subset of an inner product space formula_44 then its is the vector subspace
formula_52
which is always a closed subset (hence, a closed vector subspace) of formula_44 that satisfies:
* formula_54;
* formula_55;
* formula_56;
* formula_57;
* formula_58.

If formula_50 is a vector subspace of an inner product space formula_44 then 
formula_61 
If formula_50 is a closed vector subspace of a Hilbert space formula_44 then 
formula_64
where formula_65 is called the of formula_44 into formula_50 and formula_68 and it indicates that formula_50 is a complemented subspace of formula_44 with complement formula_71

=== Properties ===

The orthogonal complement is always closed in the metric topology. In finite-dimensional spaces, that is merely an instance of the fact that all subspaces of a vector space are closed. In infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, some subspaces are not closed, but all orthogonal complements are closed. If formula_1 is a vector subspace of a Hilbert space the orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement of formula_1 is the closure of formula_74 that is,
formula_75

Some other useful properties that always hold are the following. Let formula_44 be a Hilbert space and let formula_77 and formula_78 be linear subspaces. Then:
* formula_79;
* if formula_80 then formula_81;
* formula_82;
* formula_83;
* if formula_77 is a closed linear subspace of formula_44 then formula_86;
* if formula_77 is a closed linear subspace of formula_44 then formula_89 the (inner) direct sum.

The orthogonal complement generalizes to the annihilator, and gives a Galois connection on subsets of the inner product space, with associated closure operator the topological closure of the span.

=== Finite dimensions ===

For a finite-dimensional inner product space of dimension formula_90, the orthogonal complement of a formula_91-dimensional subspace is an formula_92-dimensional subspace, and the double orthogonal complement is the original subspace:
formula_93

If formula_94, where formula_95, formula_96, and formula_97 refer to the row space, column space, and null space of formula_15 (respectively), then
formula_99

==Banach spaces==
There is a natural analog of this notion in general Banach spaces. In this case one defines the orthogonal complement of formula_1 to be a subspace of the dual of formula_2 defined similarly as the annihilator
formula_102

It is always a closed subspace of formula_103. There is also an analog of the double complement property. formula_104 is now a subspace of formula_105(which is not identical to formula_2). However, the reflexive spaces have a natural isomorphism formula_107 between formula_2 and formula_105. In this case we have formula_110

This is a rather straightforward consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem.

==Applications==
In special relativity the orthogonal complement is used to determine the simultaneous hyperplane at a point of a world line. The bilinear form formula_111 used in Minkowski space determines a pseudo-Euclidean space of events. The origin and all events on the light cone are self-orthogonal. When a time event and a space event evaluate to zero under the bilinear form, then they are hyperbolic-orthogonal. This terminology stems from the use of conjugate hyperbolas in the pseudo-Euclidean plane: conjugate diameters of these hyperbolas are hyperbolic-orthogonal.

<text>In psychology, developmental stage theories are theories that divide psychological development into distinct stages which are characterized by qualitative differences in behavior.

There are several different views about psychological and physical development and how they proceed throughout the life span. The two main psychological developmental theories include continuous and discontinuous development. In addition to individual differences in development, developmental psychologists generally agree that development occurs in an orderly way and in different areas simultaneously.

== Stage theories ==
The development of the human mind is complex and a debated subject, and may take place in a continuous or discontinuous fashion. Continuous development, like the height of a child, is measurable and quantitative, while discontinuous development is qualitative, like hair or skin color, where those traits fall only under a few specific phenotypes. Continuous development involves gradual and ongoing changes throughout the life span, with behavior in the earlier stages of development providing the basis of skills and abilities required for the next stages. On the other hand, discontinuous development involves distinct and separate stages, with different kinds of behavior occurring in each stage.

Stage theories of development rest on the assumption that development is a discontinuous process involving distinct &quot;stages&quot; which are characterized by qualitative differences in behavior. They also assume that the structure of the stage is not variable according to each individual; however the time of each stage may vary individually. While some theories focus primarily on the healthy development of children, others propose stages that are characterized by a maturity rarely reached before old age.

===Ego-psychology===
The psychosexual stage theory created by Sigmund Freud (b.1856) consists of five distinct stages of Psychosexual development that individuals will pass through for the duration of their lifespan. Four of these stages stretch from birth through puberty and the final stage continues throughout the remainder of life. Erik Erikson (b.1902) developed a psychosocial developmental theory, which was both influenced and built upon by Freud, which includes four childhood and four adult stages of life that capture the essence of personality during each period of development. Each of Erikson&#x27;s stages include both a positive and negative influences that can go on to be seen later in an individual&#x27;s life. His theory includes the influence of biological factors on development. Jane Loevinger (b.1918) built on the work of Erikson in her description of stages of ego development.

===Individuation and attachment in ego-psychology===
Margaret Mahler&#x27;s (b.1897) theory of separation-individuation in child development contains three phases regarding the child&#x27;s object relations. John Bowlby&#x27;s (b.1907) attachment theory proposes that developmental needs and attachment in children are connected to particular people, places, and objects throughout our lives. These connections provide a behavior in the young child that is heavily affected and relied on throughout the entire lifespan. In case of maternal deprivation, this development may be disturbed. Robert Kegan (b.1946) provided a theory of the evolving self, which describes the constructive development theory of subject–object relations. 

===Cognitive and moral development===

====Cognitive development====

=====Piaget&#x27;s cognitive development theory=====

Jean Piaget&#x27;s cognitive developmental theory describes four major stages from birth through puberty, the last of which starts at 12 years and has no terminating age: Sensorimotor: (birth to 2 years), Preoperations: (2 to 7 years), Concrete operations: (7 to 11 years), and Formal Operations: (from 12 years). Each stage has at least two substages, usually called early and fully. Piaget&#x27;s theory is a structural stage theory, which implies that:
* Each stage is qualitatively different; it is a change in nature, not just quantity;
* Each stage lays the foundation for the next;
* Everyone goes through the stages in the same order.

=====Neo-Piagetian theories=====

Neo-Piagetian theories criticize and build on Piaget&#x27;s work. Juan Pascaual-Leone was the first to propose a neo-Piagetian stage theory. Since that time several neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development have been proposed. These include the theories of Robbie Case, Grame Halford, Andreas Demetriou and Kurt W. Fischer. The theory of Michael Commons&#x27; model of hierarchical complexity is also relevant. The description of stages in these theories is more elaborate and focuses on underlying mechanisms of information processing rather than on reasoning as such. In fact, development in information processing capacity is invoked to explain the development of reasoning. More stages are described (as many as 15 stages), with 4 being added beyond the stage of Formal operations. Most stage sequences map onto one another. Post-Piagetian stages are free of content and context and are therefore very general.

=====Other related theories=====
Lawrence Kohlberg (b.1927) in his stages of moral development described how individuals developed moral reasoning. Kohlberg agreed with Piaget&#x27;s theory of moral development that moral understanding is linked to cognitive development. His three levels were categorized as: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional, all of which have two sub-stages. James W. Fowler (b.1940), and his stages of faith development theory, builds off of both Piaget&#x27;s and Kohlberg&#x27;s schemes.

===Learning and education===
Maria Montessori (b.1871) described a number of stages in her educational philosophy. Albert Bandura (b.1925), in his social learning theory, emphasizes the child&#x27;s experiential learning from the environment.

===Spirituality and consultancy===
Inspired by Theosophy, Rudolf Steiner (b.1861) had developed a stage theory based on seven-year life phases. Three childhood phases (conception to 21 years) are followed by three stages of development of the ego (21–42 years), concluding with three stages of spiritual development (42-63). The theory is applied in Waldorf education

Clare W. Graves (b.1914) developed an emergent cyclical levels of existence theory. It was popularized by Don Beck (b.1937) and Chris Cowan&#x27;s as spiral dynamics, and mainly applied in consultancy. Ken Wilber (b.1949) integrated Spiral Dynamics in his integral theory, which also includes psychological stages of development as described by Jean Piaget and Jane Loevinger, the spiritual models of Sri Aurobindo and Rudolf Steiner, and Jean Gebsers theory of mutations of consciousness in human history.

===Other theories===
Lev Vygotsky (b.1896) developed several theories, particularly zone of proximal development. Other theories are not exactly developmental stage theories, but do incorporate a hierarchy of psychological factors and elements. Abraham Maslow (b.1908) described a hierarchy of needs. James Marcia (b.1937) developed a theory of identity achievement and identity status.

<doc id="1058844" wikidata="Q195415" url="?curid=1058844" title="Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23">
<text>The Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23 () (GRAU designation: 9A-620 for GSh-6-23, 9A-768 for GSh-6-23M modernized variant) is a six-barreled 23 mm rotary cannon used by some modern Soviet/Russian military aircraft.

The GSh-6-23 differs from most American multi-barreled aircraft cannon in that it is gas-operated, rather than externally powered via an electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic system.

The GSh-6-23 uses the 23×115 Russian AM-23 round, fed via linked cartridge belt or a linkless feed system. The linkless system, adopted after numerous problems and failures with the belt feed, is limited. Fire control is electrical, using a 27 V DC system. The cannon has 10 pyrotechnic cocking charges, similar to those used in European gas-operated revolver cannon such as the DEFA 554 or Mauser BK-27.

The rapid rate of fire exhausts ammunition quickly: the Mikoyan MiG-31 aircraft, for example, with 260 rounds of ammunition (800 rounds maximum), would empty its ammunition tank in less than two seconds.

GSh-6-23M has the highest rate of fire out of any autocannon so far.

The GSh-6-23 is used by the Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft, the MiG-31 interceptor aircraft, and the now-obsolete Sukhoi Su-15 among others. However, after two Su-24s were lost because of premature shell detonation in 1983, and because of some other problems with gun usage (such as system failures), usage of the GSh-6-23 was stopped by a decision of the Soviet Air Force Command. At present all aircraft in the Russian Aerospace Forces are flying with fully operational guns.

It is also used in the SPPU-6 gun pod, which can traverse to −45° elevation, and ±45° azimuth.

<text>The Channel Country is a region of outback Australia mostly in the state of Queensland but also in parts of South Australia, Northern Territory and New South Wales. The name comes from the numerous intertwined rivulets that cross the region, which cover 150,000 km². The Channel Country is over the Cooper and Eromanga geological basins and the Lake Eyre Basin drainage basin. Further to the east is the less arid Maranoa district.

==Geography==
Birdsville and Windorah are the most prominent towns in the area. Other settlements include Betoota and Bedourie. Haddon Corner is also located in the Channel Country. The Channel Country is the location for a majority of Min Min light sightings. It is also home to at least two important bird areas, Lake Yamma Yamma and the Lake Machattie Area.

The Channel Country features an arid landscape with a series of ancient flood plains from rivers which only flow intermittently. The principal rivers are Georgina River, Cooper Creek and the Diamantina River. When there is sufficient rainfall in their catchment area these rivers flow into Lake Eyre, South Australia. In most years the flood waters are absorbed into the earth or evaporate, however. One of the most significant rainfall events occurred in 2010 when a monsoonal low from ex-Cyclone Olga created a period of exceptional rainfall.

===Land use===
The primary land use is cattle grazing which has replaced sheep grazing. It is estimated that in the Queensland section alone there are between half to one million head of cattle. The area&#x27;s towns and cattle stations are serviced by a mail run that is operated by West Wing Aviation which delivers goods and passengers as well as mail.

In 2013, the Queensland Government placed caps on water extraction from the region&#x27;s river to prevent the introduction of cotton growing. At the same time open-cut mining was banned but coal seam and underground mining have been permitted after changes were made to the Wild Rivers legislation.

In 2021, 11 coal seam gas exploration licenses were granted to Origin Energy by the state government, covering 250,000 hectares of the region. Origin subsequently announced it is withdrawing from the region with a view to sell its exploration permits to another energy company or forfeit the sites.

===Bioregion===
The Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia Channel Country Bioregion covers a larger area, extending into South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales and includes the town of Innamincka.

==History==
Indigenous Australians have inhabited the area for approximately 20,000 years, with over 25 tribal groups living in the Channel Country area. A vast trade network had been established running from north to south with goods such as ochre sent north with shells and pituri moved south. Birdsville was once a major meeting place for conducting ceremonies and trade. Originally known as &quot;Diamantina Crossing&quot;, it bore its current name by 1882, and the name was formalised at the proclamation of the town in 1887.

Innamincka Station was established in 1872 by Robert Bostock and grew until it covered over and in 1881 it supported a herd of 8,000 cattle. The first station and permanent settlement set up along the Cooper Creek. The tender was accepted for the run named Caryapundy by J. C. Myers in 1872. Myers has also had his tenders accepted for other runs such as Bollwarry, Mount Wood, Teriwinda and Torrens Creek.

Annandale Station was established when Patrick Drinan took up the run in July 1876. Other properties were settled soon afterward including Kaliduwarry and Glengyle Stations. Pandie Pandie Station was established in the same year by Robert Frew as was Alton Downs and Planet Downs. Nearby Haddon Downs station was also taken up by Frew in 1877. Diamantina Lakes Station was also established in 1876 with a partnership between John Arthur Macartney and Hugh Louis Heber-Percy who initially took up the lease.

<doc id="1058853" wikidata="Q5478789" url="?curid=1058853" title="Frances Lankin">
<text>Frances Lankin, (born April 16, 1954), is a former Canadian senator, former president and CEO of United Way Toronto, and a former Ontario MPP and cabinet minister in the NDP government of Bob Rae between 1990 and 1995. From 2010 to 2012, she co-chaired a government commission review of social assistance in Ontario. From 2009 to 2016, she was a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee.

Lankin was appointed to the Senate on March 18, 2016, on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She sat with the Independent Senators Group until February 2024 when she accepted to become the Government Liaison in the upper chamber to table and help adopt a package of rule changes that increases the equity between the different groups in the Senate. Her time at the Government Representative&#x27;s Office (GRO) changed her designation to non-affiliated. Following the adoption of the rules package modifications, she rejoined the ISG in May 2024. She retired from the Senate on October 21st, 2024, prior to her mandatory retirement date. 

==Background==
Lankin was born in London, Ontario. She started her career as the executive director of a childcare centre before attending the University of Toronto to study criminology. Due to a provincial government hiring freeze, Lankin was unable to get a position in her desired field, working in probation and parole, so she accepted a position as a correctional officer. Lankin was one of the first women correctional officers to work at the Don Jail, an all-male institution. After four years, Lankin became a probation and parole officer before taking a position with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU).

Lankin was a very active member of OPSEU, where she focused on many issues of concern to women workers. She took a position as Equal Opportunity Coordinator with the union, working on such issues as paid maternity leave, pay equity and childcare. While at OPSEU, Lankin helped found the Ontario Coalition for Better Childcare and was provincial spokesperson for the Equal Pay Coalition. She eventually became an economic researcher and finally a full-time negotiator for the union. During her time at OPSEU, Lankin was appointed by the provincial government to the Workers&#x27; Compensation Appeals Tribunal for a 3-year term.

==Provincial politics==

===In government===
In 1985, Lankin tried to be the NDP nomination candidate in the riding of Riverdale. She lost to David Reville who went on to win the seat.

Lankin was elected Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Toronto riding of Beaches—Woodbine in the 1990 provincial election, succeeding Marion Bryden who retired from politics. The NDP under Bob Rae won its first-ever majority government in this election, and Lankin, then thirty-six years old, was appointed to cabinet on October 1, 1990, as Minister of Government Services and Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet. She announced that same-sex spouses of civil servants would be eligible for insurance and medical benefits.

Lankin was promoted to Minister of Health on April 22, 1991. She soon developed a reputation as one of the most proficient ministers in Rae&#x27;s government, and won praise for her attention to administrative detail. She managed to bring the $17 billion health budget under control by reducing out-of-province charges to OHIP and reducing costs for the province&#x27;s drug benefit plan. She also increased funding for AIDS initiatives and made it easier for Ontario residents to receive treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. She also became one of Rae&#x27;s most trusted ministers, and a part of his &quot;inner circle&quot;.

On February 3, 1993, Lankin was shifted to the position of Minister of Economic Development and Trade.

The Rae government was defeated in the provincial election of 1995, although Lankin was re-elected in Beaches-Woodbine by about 3,000 votes over her nearest opponent. After the election she was named finance critic and party whip.

===Cabinet positions===

===Leadership race===

When Rae resigned as NDP leader in 1996, Lankin declared herself a candidate to succeed him. She was regarded as the frontrunner in this race, and was strongly supported by senior members of the Rae government and the party establishment. However, this identification actually damaged her popularity among party delegates who were disappointed by the rightward shifts of the Rae government. Rival candidate Peter Kormos accused her in the leadership debate of bearing responsibility for the &quot;social contract&quot; — which forced open collective bargaining agreements with public sector unions and was deeply unpopular with labour — and for the Rae government&#x27;s abandonment of a promise to institute a publicly run auto insurance system.

Lankin&#x27;s actual position in relation to the &quot;social contract&quot; was somewhat complicated. She initially opposed the Rae government&#x27;s plans to revisit existing labour contracts, and personally warned Rae of the fallout that would result from organized labour. She later considered resigning from cabinet over the issue on two separate occasions, but ultimately chose to remain because (she argued) it would give her the opportunity to moderate the legislation. She did, in fact, replace Rae&#x27;s initial plans for outright wage rollbacks with requirements that workers above a certain income level take unpaid leave days. Even in this moderated form, however, the legislation was highly unpopular and strained the NDP&#x27;s relations with the labour movement.

As a result of criticisms from Kormos and others, many of Lankin&#x27;s potential supporters went to rival candidate Howard Hampton, who had also been a cabinet minister in the Rae government, but was not part of Rae&#x27;s inner circle. Hampton defeated Lankin on the third ballot by fewer than 200 votes.

===In opposition===
While in opposition, she wrote and submitted a private-members&#x27; bill banning the use of restraints on elderly patients. Her bill was unanimously carried by all parties in the Legislature and became one of two private members bills submitted and passed by Lankin, a very rare accomplishment for a third-party opposition MPP. She was inspired to propose the bill after discovering that her own mother suffering from dementia had been tied to her bed in a Toronto area hospital.

In the 1999 Ontario election, which reduced the NDP to only nine seats, Lankin scored a convincing re-election victory in the redistributed riding of Beaches—East York. Lankin resigned her seat in June 2001 to accept a position as president and CEO of United Way Toronto.

==United Way Toronto==
Lankin was the president and CEO of United Way Toronto from 2001 to 2011, guiding the organization through its transformation from a trusted fundraiser to an organization dedicated to addressing underlying root causes of social problems. Under Lankin&#x27;s leadership, United Way Toronto engaged in a number of strategic initiatives that aimed to improve the lives of individuals, families and neighbourhoods in Toronto, including:

*a five-year plan to develop social infrastructure and engage residents in priority neighbourhoods identified in conjunction with the City of Toronto
*partnerships with government, business and labour to focus attention and resources on United Way Toronto&#x27;s key priority areas: neighbourhoods, youth and newcomers
*development of social research reports such as Losing Ground: The Persistent Growth of Family Poverty in Canada&#x27;s Largest City, Decade of Decline: Poverty and Income Inequality in the City of Toronto in the 1990s and Poverty by Postal Code: The Geography of Neighbourhood Poverty to identify and highlight challenges faced by the most underserved inner-suburbs of Toronto
*building and strengthening United Way Toronto&#x27;s network of health and social service agencies through funding and development of agency capacity and leadership
*mobilization of the community&#x27;s volunteer and financial resources

Lankin retired from the United Way in 2011.

==Other work==
In addition to her role at United Way, Lankin has served on several Crown, not-for-profit, charitable and corporate boards. Over the years, she has served on the boards of Equal Voice, The Canadian Club, The Canadian Foundation for Economic Education (CFEE), Altruvest Charitable Services Seneca College, the Toronto City Summit Alliance, the University of Toronto&#x27;s School of Public Policy Advisory Committee, the Board of the Ontario Hospital Association, the Board of the Literary Review of Canada, the Mowat Centre&#x27;s Advisory Committee, the National NewsMedia Council, the Ontario Press Council, the Institute of Corporate Directors,  the TELUS Toronto Community Board, Metrolinx, Hydro One and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. She co-chaired the Toronto City Summit in June 2002 and 2003.

In 2006, she co-chaired a federal government Blue Ribbon Panel, which made recommendations for improving how the federal government distributes grants and contributions to charities and other organizations.

In 2009, Lankin was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council of Canada, appointed by prime minister Stephen Harper as a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which provides an external review of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

In 2010, the provincial government of Ontario announced the appointment of Lankin and Munir Sheikh to lead the Commission for the Review of Social Assistance in Ontario, as part of the province&#x27;s poverty reduction strategy. They released a report, Brighter Prospects: Transforming Social Assistance in Ontario , in 2012 with their findings.

In 2012, Lankin was named a Trudeau mentor by the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation, and in 2013, she became a fellow at the Broadbent Institute.

In 2014, Lankin was appointed to the Ontario Premier&#x27;s Advisory Council on Government Assets, whose mandate was to review and identify opportunities to modernize government business enterprises. Lankin also served as a member and chair of the Ontario Press Council and was the inaugural chair of the National NewsMedia Council.

== Awards ==
On June 29, 2012, Lankin was made a Member of the Order of Canada. Her citation reads, &quot;For her contributions to social justice as a politician and as a social service administrator, championing the rights of women and the disadvantaged.&quot; She has received numerous awards including honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Queen&#x27;s University, Ryerson University and the University of Windsor, as well as a Doctor of Education from Nipissing University.

== Federal politics ==
Lankin was appointed to the Senate on March 18, 2016, on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

During her time in the Senate, she has been a member of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Joint Parliamentarians (NSICOP) since its inception in 2018, until today.

In 1662, the Apostolic Vicariate of Siam was created on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Cochinchina, based in Vietnam.
It was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Siam on 10 September 1841, having lost territory to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Western Siam. On 5 May 1899 it lost more territory to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Laos.

It was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Bangkok on 3 December 1924.

It lost more territories: on 30 June 1930 to establish the Mission sui juris of Rajaburi, on 
11 May 1944 to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Chantaburi and on 17 November 1959 to establish the Apostolic Prefecture of Chieng-Mai. All three of these have become its suffragans.
On 18 December 1965, it was elevated to the rank of a Metropolitan archdiocese.

On 9 February 1967 it lost territory to establish the Diocese of Nakhon Sawan as its suffragan.

It was visited by Pope John Paul II in May 1984 and Pope Francis in November 2019.

== Extent ==
The archdiocese covers an area of 18,831 km2, and as of 2002 it is responsible for 81,646 Catholic Christians, 0.7% of the about 12 million living in the area. It covers the administrative provinces Ayutthaya, Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon and Suphanburi; also the parts west of the Bang Pa Kong River of Chachoengsao and Ban Na of Nakhon Nayok belong to the diocese.

<doc id="1058859" wikidata="Q7847504" url="?curid=1058859" title="True Parallels">
<text>True Parallels is the second studio album by American rock band Trust Company. Originally to be released in 2004, the release date was pushed back to March 21, 2005, internationally and on March 22, 2005, in the United States. Despite little promotion from their label, the album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts at number 32 and has gone on to sell in excess of 200,000 copies.

== Background ==
Trust Company was originally scheduled to play at Ozzfest 2003, but canceled to focus on finishing &quot;True Parallels&quot;. Several months prior to the album&#x27;s release, original bassist Josh Moates left the group and was replaced by Walker Warren.

&quot;Stronger&quot; was released in February 2005 as the album&#x27;s single. It has two versions for the music videos, the original version features the band performing at a party. The video was unreleased until it was uploaded in May 2017 by former bassist Walker Warren and was later posted on Trust Company&#x27;s Facebook page, the MTV2 version which received moderate airplay, features the band performing in a skatepark. According to drummer Jason Singleton on the band&#x27;s message board, &quot;The War is Over&quot; gained much popularity within the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; film-making community and was considered for a second single.

When they were known as 41Down, the track that bore the title of this album was later remade for their album &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; as the track &quot;Falling Apart&quot;.

<doc id="1058863" wikidata="Q6241785" url="?curid=1058863" title="John Jenkins (governor)">
<text>John Jenkins was an English soldier and radical advocate for self-government. He served as governor of Albemarle (now North Carolina) four times: 1672–1675; 1676–1677; 1678–1679; 1680–1681, becoming the only person who has served as proprietary governor so many times.

== Biography ==

John Jenkins was born in England. Jenkins first arrived in Maryland in the 1650s. He was given the title Captain, and he likely served in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army. His first wife, Ann, was listed as a &quot;transport&quot; in local records, and likely arrived in Maryland as a servant. Ann died around the time her terms of service expired. Jenkins then married Johanna Gerald, whose family was widely known in the Chesapeake for their radical, antimonarchical views and support for democratic republican government in the English colonies. John and Johanna initially lived on a track of land in Charles County, Maryland. After a group of republicans rejected Maryland&#x27;s royalist government, John served in some representative capacity in local government. With Royalist government restored in Maryland in the early 1660s, John and Johanna moved to settlements in Albemarle Sound in the early 1660s. These settlements were highly egalitarian, peopled by refugees, outcasts, and egalitarians who had battled against aristocracy and monarchy in the English Civil Wars. Radically egalitarian religious groups such as the Quakers, who had been persecuted and driven out of Massachusetts and Virginia, found a warm reception in Albemarle. The English settlers around Albemarle cultivated and maintained unusually respectful relations with the regions Native American groups.

In 1670 he was deputy of the Earl of Craven and had risen to the dignity of Colonel, and was senior member of the Council.

When Governor Carteret left Albemarle in April 1672 and went to England, he authorized Colonel Jenkins as deputy governor. As acting governor, Jenkins welcomed radical Quakers such as George Fox to the colony. Jenkins remained De facto governor for more than three years. By fall 1675, the colonists established a new assembly, which was led by Thomas Eastchurch. Eastchurch had Jenkins imprisoned and assumed the role of the Governor of General Assembly of North Carolina. However, in the spring of 1676, Johanna Jenkins had rallied her husbands allies and had him released from prison. Now free, Jenkins forced Eastchurch out of Albemarle. When Virginians who had been involved in Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion had to flee, Jenkins welcomed them to Albemarle, where they would be safe from retribution by Virginia Governor Berkeley. Under Jenkins, settlers in ALbemarle had also developed trade relations with New England merchants, who gladly worked with the Albemarle settlers to evade imperial customs duties.

Royalists such as Thomas Miller and Thomas Eastchurch informed officials in London that Jenkins was allowing democracy to flourish in Albemarle and that they were working with New England merchants, who were already suspect in London. Miller, promising to restore royal rule and eliminate the radicalism that pervaded the Albemarle settlements, managed to have himself appointed governor. However, Miller did not serve long, as the Albemarle settlers, led by Jenkins, plotted Miller&#x27;s overthrow. The series of event took place known as Culpeper&#x27;s Rebellion leading to the arrest of Miller and Jenkins elevation to governor by popular acclaim. The rebel government hold position to the end of 1678, and the assembly met in the home of John and Johanna Jenkins. During the time, the radically democratic Albemarle republic became, in the words of one Royalist official, a haven for &quot;negros, Indians and English servants.&quot; As the southern colonies became more heavily dominated by white planters committed to black slavery, servants, slaves, and other democrats fled to the Jenkins&#x27; Albemarle settlements. More than anywhere in colonial America, the Albemarle settlements led by John and Johanna Jenkins became a multi-racial democracy where woman exercised political influence. In 1679 John Harvey assumed the position, but died six months later. The council elected Jenkins acting governor. At this position he has served up to his death in Perquimans County, North Carolina, on 17 December 1681.

== Personal life ==
John Jenkins is believed to have graduated from Clare College, Cambridge in 1642. Jenkins married twice. He was survived by Johanna, who later married Thomas Harvey (North Carolina governor). No exact data is stored about the heirs of Jenkins, also it might be that he had a daughter Joanna Jenkins.

<text>Hypnotize is the fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band System of a Down. It was released on November 22, 2005, six months after the release of its companion album &quot;Mezmerize&quot;. &quot;Mezmerize&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; both debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

==Reception==
&quot;Hypnotize&quot; received generally positive reviews. It opened at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 320,000 copies sold in its first week.

<doc id="1058883" wikidata="Q229208" url="?curid=1058883" title="Claude of France">
<text>Claude of France (13 October 1499 – 26 July 1524) was Queen of France from 1 January 1515 as the wife of King Francis I and Duchess of Brittany in her own right from 9 January 1514 until her death in 1524. She was the eldest daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany.

==Life==

Claude was born on 13 October 1499 in Romorantin-Lanthenay as the eldest daughter of King Louis XII of France and his second wife, Duchess Anne of Brittany. She was named after Claudius of Besançon, a saint her mother had invoked during a pilgrimage so she could give birth to a living child. During her two marriages, Anne had at least fourteen pregnancies, of whom only two children survived to adulthood: Claude and her youngest sister Renée, born in 1510.

===Marriage negotiations===
Because her mother had no surviving sons, Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany. The crown of France, however, could pass only to and through male heirs, according to Salic Law. Eager to keep Brittany separated from the French crown, Queen Anne, with help of Cardinal Georges d&#x27;Amboise, promoted a solution for this problem, a marriage contract between Claude and the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

This sparked a dispute between the Cardinal and (1451–1513), Lord of Rohan, known as the &quot;Marshal of Gié&quot;, who fervently supported the idea of a marriage between the princess and Francis, Duke of Valois, the heir presumptive to the French throne, which would keep Brittany united to France.

On 10 August 1501 at Lyon the marriage contract between Claude and the future Charles V was signed by François de Busleyden, Archbishop of Besançon, William de Croÿ, Nicolas de Rutter and Pierre Lesseman, all ambassadors of Duke Philip of Burgundy, Charles&#x27; father. A part of the contract promised the inheritance of Brittany to the young prince, already the next in line to thrones of Castile and Aragon, Austria and the Burgundian Estates.

In addition, the first Treaty of Blois, signed in 1504, gave Claude a considerable dowry in the case of her father&#x27;s death without male heirs: besides Brittany, Claude also received the Duchies of Milan and Burgundy, the Counties of Blois and Asti and the territory of the Republic of Genoa, then occupied by France.

In 1505, her father, Louis, very sick, cancelled Claude&#x27;s engagement to Charles in the Estates Generals of Tours, in favor of his heir, Francis, Duke of Valois. Louise of Savoy had obtained from the king a secret promise that Claude would be married to her son. Queen Anne, furious to see the triumph of the Marshal of Gié, exerted all her influence to obtain his conviction for treason before the Parliament of Paris.

===Duchess of Brittany===

On 9 January 1514, when her mother died, Claude became Duchess of Brittany; and four months later, on 18 May, at the age of 14, she married her cousin Francis at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. With this union, it was secured that Brittany would remain united to the French crown, unless the third marriage of Louis with Mary of England (celebrated on 9 October 1514) produced the long-waited heir. However, the third marriage of Louis was short-lived and childless: Louis XII died on 1 January 1515, less than three months after the wedding. Francis and Claude became king and queen.

As Duchess of Brittany, Claude left all the affairs of the duchy to her spouse; she did, however, refuse his repeated suggestion to have Brittany incorporated into France, and instead named her oldest son, Francis, heir to the duchy.

===Queen of France===
As queen, Claude was eclipsed at court by her mother-in-law, Louise of Savoy, and her sister-in-law, the literary Navarrese queen Margaret of Angoulême. She never ruled over Brittany; in 1515 she gave the government of her domains to her husband in perpetuity. Unlike her younger sister Renée, she seems to have never showed any interest in her maternal inheritance nor had any disposition to politics, as she preferred to devote herself to religion under the influence, according to some sources, of Christopher Numar of Forlì, who was the confessor of her mother-in-law. Gabriel Miron repeated his functions under Anne of Brittany and remained as chancellor of Queen Claude and first doctor; he wrote a book entitled &quot;de Regimine infantium tractatus tres&quot;.

After Francis became king in 1515, Anne Boleyn stayed as a member of Claude&#x27;s household. Renée of France later mentioned that she was one of Claude&#x27;s maid of honour. It is assumed that Anne served as Claude&#x27;s interpreter whenever there were English visitors, such as in 1520, at the Field of Cloth of Gold. Anne Boleyn returned to England in late 1521, where she eventually became Queen of England as the second wife of Henry VIII. Diane de Poitiers, another of Claude&#x27;s ladies, was a principal inspiration of the School of Fontainebleau of the French Renaissance, and became the lifelong mistress of Claude&#x27;s son, Henry II.

Claude was crowned Queen of France at St. Denis Basilica on 10 May 1517 by Cardinal Philippe de Luxembourg (also known as Cardinal du Mans), who &quot;anointed her in the breast and forehead&quot;.

She spent almost all her marriage in an endless round of annual pregnancies. Her husband had many mistresses, but was usually relatively discreet. Claude imposed a strict moral code on her own household, which only a few chose to flout.

About Claude, the historian Brantôme wrote:

The pawn of so much dynastic maneuvering, Claude was short in stature and affected by scoliosis, which gave her a hunched back, while her husband was bigger and athletic. The successive pregnancies made her appear continuously plump, which drew mockeries at Court. Foreign ambassadors noted her &quot;corpulence&quot;, claudication (tendency to limping), the strabismus affecting her left eye, her small size, and her ugliness, but they acknowledged her good qualities. She was little loved at court after the death of her parents. Brantôme testified:

The king&#x27;s will imposed the omnipresence of his mistress, Françoise de Foix.

===Death===
Claude died on 26 July 1524 at the Château de Blois, aged twenty-four. The exact cause of her death was disputed among sources and historians: while some alleged that she died in childbirth or after a miscarriage, others believed that she died for exhaustion after her many pregnancies or after developing bone tuberculosis (like her mother) and finally some believed that she died from syphilis caught from her husband. She was buried at St. Denis Basilica.

She was initially succeeded as ruler of Brittany by her eldest son, the Dauphin Francis, who became Duke Francis III, with Claude&#x27;s widower King Francis I as guardian. After the Dauphin&#x27;s death in 1536, Claude&#x27;s second son, Henry, Duke of Orleans, became Dauphin and Duke of Brittany. He later became King of France as Henry II.

Claude&#x27;s widowed husband himself remarried several years after Claude&#x27;s death, to Eleanor of Austria, the sister of Emperor Charles V. The atmosphere at court became considerably more debauched, and there were rumours that King Francis&#x27; death in 1547 was due to syphilis.

== Physical appearance==
Foreign ambassadors noted her &quot;strong corpulence&quot;, her limp, the strabismus of her left eye, her short stature, her ugliness, and her reserve, but they also emphasized her good-hearted nature.

It has been speculated based on these descriptions that she had Down syndrome.

==Issue==
Claude and Francis I had:
* Louise (19 August 1515 – 21 September 1518, aged three): died young, engaged to Charles I of Spain almost from birth until death.
* Charlotte (23 October 1516 – 8 September 1524, aged seven): died young, engaged to Charles I of Spain from 1518 until death.
* Francis (28 February 1518 – 10 August 1536, aged 18), who succeeded Claude as Duke of Brittany, but died unmarried and childless.
* Henry II (31 March 1519 – 10 July 1559, aged 40), who succeeded Francis I as King of France and married Catherine de&#x27; Medici, by whom he had issue.
* Madeleine (10 August 1520 – 2 July 1537, aged 16), who married James V of Scotland and had no issue.
* Charles (22 January 1522 – 9 September 1545, aged 23), who died unmarried and childless.
* Margaret (5 June 1523 – 14 September 1574, aged 51), who married Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1559 and had issue.

<text>Weipa () is a coastal mining town in the local government area of Weipa Town in Queensland. It is one of the largest towns on the Cape York Peninsula. It exists because of the enormous bauxite deposits along the coast. The Port of Weipa is mainly involved in exports of bauxite. There are also shipments of live cattle from the port.

In the , the town of Weipa had a population of 4,097 people.

==Geography==
Weipa is on the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula facing the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Weipa is just south of Duyfken Point, which was named by Matthew Flinders on 8 November 1802 after the ship &quot;Duyfken&quot; commanded by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon. It is claimed that Janszoon was the first European to sight the Australian coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1606, 164 years before Lieutenant James Cook sailed up the east coast of Australia.

The town consists of three residential suburbs, Rocky Point, Trunding, and Nanum, in addition to the industrial suburb of Evans Landing; these suburbs are contiguous. The town also includes the suburb of Weipa Airport which is not connected to the other suburbs and contains the town&#x27;s airport.

==History==
===Traditional owners and languages===
Yupanguthi (Yuputhimri, Jupangati, Yupangathi, Nggerikudi, Yupungati, Jupangati) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yupanguthi country. The Yupanguthi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Cook and Weipa Region.

Kugu Yi&#x27;anh is a language of Cape York. The traditional language area of Kugu Yi&#x27;anh includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire.

Kugu Nganchara (also known as Wik, Wiknantjara, Wik Nganychara, Wik Ngencherr. See also related Wik languages) is a traditional language of the area which includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire.

Kugu Muminh (also known as Kuku-Muminh. See also related Wik languages) is one of the traditional languages which includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire. Thaynakwith (also known as Awngthim, Tainikuit and Winduwinda) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Western Cape York in the Weipa area taking in Albatross Bay and Mission River. The language region includes areas within the local government boundaries of Weipa Town Council and Cook Shire.

===Weipa Mission===
In 1895, Presbyterian missionary Reverend Nicholas John Hey established a mission at the junction of Embley River and Spring Creek which he called Weipa, which is believed to derive from the Anhathangayth word meaning &quot;fighting ground&quot;. In 1932 the mission relocated approximately to Jessica Point, continuing under the same name, Weipa Mission.

Very restrictive legislation was enacted by the state of Queensland in 1911, making the Protector of Aborigines the legal guardian of every Aboriginal and part-Aboriginal child (until he/she was 21), and the right to confine (or expel) any such person within any Aboriginal reserve or institution, and the right to imprison any Aboriginal or part-Aboriginal person for 14 days if, in the Protector&#x27;s judgement, they were guilty of neglect of duty, gross insubordination or wilful preaching of disobedience. It also gave powers to the police to confine Aboriginal people to reserves to &quot;protect them from corruption&quot;. This latter power was given by Comalco in 1957 to justify the removal of Weipa Aboriginal people.

In 1932, the community had to relocate to its present site, at Jessica Point now called Napranum because of malaria. It is about south of the present town of Weipa. At this time most of the people were Awngthim but soon different tribes and clans and other communities were forcibly removed from Old Mapoon. To prevent the spread of malaria, the Old Mapoon settlement was burnt down on 15 November 1963.

===Mining town===
In 1955 a geologist, Henry Evans (1912–1990), discovered that the red cliffs on the Aboriginal reserve, previously remarked on by the early Dutch explorers and Matthew Flinders, were actually enormous deposits of bauxite – the ore from which aluminium is made – and to a lesser extent tungsten.

The &quot;Comalco Act 1957&quot; revoked the reserve status, giving the company of Aboriginal reserve land on the west coast of the Peninsula and on the east coast of Aboriginal-owned (though not reserve) land. Mining commenced in 1960. In 1962, residents accepted Comalco&#x27;s offer to rebuild the Jessica Point village at a cost of £150,000. By the time building began in 1965, it became clear that funding was inadequate to build houses for the whole community, which contributed towards the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s decision to hand over responsibility for the mission to the Queensland Government. The community became known as Weipa South after this.

The Weipa Parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns was established in 1982.

On 30 March 1985, the Weipa South community elected the Weipa South Aboriginal Council, and the Aboriginal reserve held by the government was transferred to the council on 27 October 1988 under a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT). In 1990, the Weipa South community became known as Napranum, meaning &quot;meeting place of the people&quot;. The DOGIT lands became known as the Napranum DOGIT in 1991. In 1992, the Peppan people, originally located to the east of Napranum, were granted freehold title to former Aboriginal reserve land, which had been leased to the Commonwealth for the construction of Scherger Air Force Base. This was the first real compensation to the people of Napranum for use of their land.

In 1995 a major industrial dispute occurred between Comalco and its workforce to maintain union coverage, pay and conditions.

On 1 January 2005, the Napranum Aboriginal Council became the Napranum Aboriginal Shire Council.

Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 3 August 1990 to on 29 October 2022.

While most climate data was taken from Weipa Airport, extreme temperatures were combined from the older Eastern Ave and newer Airport weather stations (1959-2024).


==Economy==
The present town was constructed mainly by Comalco (now called Rio Tinto), a large aluminium company, which began making trial shipments of bauxite to Japan in 1962. A railway was constructed to transport the ore from the mine at Andoom to the export facility at Lorim Point. Weipa bauxite mine is among the world&#x27;s largest. Using figures from 2006, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that it ranked third in the world, with capacity and production at 15.5 and 16.1 million tonnes respectively.

<doc id="1058896" wikidata="Q3631344" url="?curid=1058896" title="Waris Shah">
<text>Pir Waris Shah ( ; 1722 1798) was an 18th-century Punjabi Muslim Sufi poet of the Chishti order, known popularly for his contribution to Punjabi literature.

He is primarily known as the author of the &quot;Heer Ranjha&quot; love poem. It&#x27;s about one of the most popular tragic romances of Punjab. Traditionally, this love poem is recited in bhairavi raga and this continues to be done even today.

==Background==

Syed Mohammad Waris Shah was born in Jandiala Sher Khan, Punjab, present-day Pakistan, into a reputed Sayyid family and was a descendant of Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki through his son Sayyid Badruddin. His father&#x27;s name was Gulsher Shah and mother&#x27;s name was Kamal Banu. Waris&#x27;s parents are said to have died when he was young. Waris spent years in search of the perfect spiritual guide. Waris Shah acknowledged himself to be a disciple of an ustad from Kasur, namely Hafiz Ghulam Murtaza from whom he received his education. After completing his education, Waris moved to Malka Hans, a village twelve kilometres north of Pakpattan. Here he resided in a small room (or Hujra), adjacent to a historic mosque now called Masjid Waris Shah, until his death. 

Waris Shah was also an eyewitness to the first Invasion of India by the Afghan leader Ahmad Shah Abdali. He witnessed the Battle of Lahore between the Afghan forces and the Mughal forces under Shah Nawaz which resulted in Lahore coming under Afghan control during January 1748. Waris Shah condemned Shah Nawaz&#x27;s actions during the battle and even referred to him as a coward. Other poets later added their own verses in Qissa Waris Shah throughout the history. It is estimated that there are 11069 forged verses in the commonly available Qissa Waris Shah. One of the oldest and most accurate copy of Qissa Waris Shah published by Kripa Ram in 1916 is available in the Punjab Public Library in Lahore.

== Works ==
=== Examples ===
Many verses of Waris Shah are widely used in Punjab in a moral context, for instance:

* &quot;Naa adataan jaandiyan ne, Bhavein katiye poriyan poriyan ji&quot; 
:(A man never abandons his habits, even if he is hacked to pieces)
* &quot;Waris rann, faqir, talwar, ghora; Chare thok eh kisse de yar nahin&quot; (Waris says that woman, beggar, sword and horse, these four are never anyone&#x27;s friends)
* &quot;Waris Shah faqir di aqal kithe; eh pattian ishq padhiyan hun&quot;
: (It is beyond the wisdom of faqeer Waris Shah (to write this verse), (But) these lessons are taught by Love)
* &quot;Eh rooh qalboot da zikr sara nal aqal de mel bulaya ee&quot; (This entire reference is about Soul meeting with the Divine, Beloved which has been contrived with great wisdom)

== Tomb ==

The tomb or mausoleum of Waris Shah is near Sheikhupura, Punjab, Pakistan in Jandiala Sher Khan town. His urs (death anniversary) is held and celebrated there every year.

== Legacy ==
The renowned Punjabi writer and poet Amrita Pritam is best remembered for her famous work Ajj Aakhaan Waris Shah Nu (lit: &quot;Today I Invoke Waris Shah&quot;) about the horrors of the partition of the Punjab during the Partition of India.
* &quot;Ajj Akan Waris shah nu, k tu Qabran vichon bol&quot;
: (Today, I call upon Waris Shah, to rise from the grave and speak)
* Te Ajj kitaab e ishq da, koi Agla warka khol
:(And plead with him to open another page in the book of love)

== Portrayal in media ==
Waris Shah&#x27;s life has been fictionalised in Punjabi-language films. A 1964 Pakistani film titled &quot;Waris Shah&quot; featured Inayat Hussain Bhatti in the title role. Another film on the life of Shah, &quot;Sayyed Waris Shah&quot;, was released in India in 1980; followed by &quot;Waris Shah: Ishq Daa Waaris&quot; in 2006 which had Gurdas Maan in the role of Waris Shah.

<doc id="1058899" wikidata="Q2920592" url="?curid=1058899" title="Binary opposition">
<text>A binary opposition (also binary system) is a pair of related terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning. Binary opposition is the system of language and/or thought by which two theoretical opposites are strictly defined and set off against one another. It is the contrast between two mutually exclusive terms, such as on and off, up and down, left and right. Binary opposition is an important concept of structuralism, which sees such distinctions as fundamental to all language and thought. In structuralism, a binary opposition is seen as a fundamental organizer of human philosophy, culture, and language.

Binary opposition originated in Saussurean structuralist theory. According to Ferdinand de Saussure, the binary opposition is the means by which the units of language have value or meaning; each unit is defined in reciprocal determination with another term, as in binary code. For instance, &#x27;hot&#x27; gains meaning because of its relation to &#x27;cold,&#x27; and &quot;vice versa&quot;. It is not a contradictory relation but a structural, complementary one. Saussure demonstrated that a sign&#x27;s meaning is derived from its context (syntagmatic dimension) and the group (paradigm) to which it belongs. An example of this is that one cannot conceive of &#x27;good&#x27; if we do not understand &#x27;evil&#x27;.

Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is &quot;often value-laden and ethnocentric&quot;, with an illusory order and superficial meaning. Furthermore, Pieter Fourie discovered that binary oppositions have a deeper or second level of binaries that help to reinforce meaning. As an example, the concepts &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;villain&quot; involve secondary binaries: good/bad, handsome/ugly, liked/disliked, and so on.

== Theory of binaries ==
A classic example of binary opposition is the presence-absence dichotomy. According to structuralism, distinguishing between presence and absence, viewed as polar opposites, is a fundamental element of thought in many cultures. In addition, according to post-structuralist criticisms, &quot;presence&quot; occupies a position of dominance in human society over &quot;absence&quot;, because &quot;absence&quot; is traditionally seen as what you get when you take away &quot;presence&quot;. (Had &quot;absence&quot; been dominant, &quot;presence&quot; might have most naturally been seen as what you get when you take away an &quot;absence&quot;.)

According to Jacques Derrida, meaning is often defined in terms of binary oppositions, where &quot;one of the two terms governs the other.&quot; 

An example of binary opposition is the male-female dichotomy. A post-structuralist view is that &quot;male&quot; can be seen, according to traditional thought, as dominant over &quot;female&quot; because &quot;male&quot; is the presence of a phallus, while the vagina is an absence or loss. John Searle has suggested that the concept of binary oppositions—as taught and practiced by postmodernists and poststructuralists—is specious and lacking in rigor.

==Deconstruction of binaries==
The political (rather than analytic or conceptual) critique of binary oppositions is an important part of third wave feminism, post-colonialism, post-anarchism, and critical race theory, which argue that the perceived binary dichotomy between man/woman, civilized/uncivilised, and white/black have perpetuated and legitimized societal power structures favoring a specific majority. In the last fifteen years it has become routine for many social and/or historical analyses to address the variables of gender, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity. Within each of these categories there is usually an unequal binary opposition: bourgeoisie/working class man; men/women; heterosexual/homosexual. In critical race theory, the paradigm is known as the black–white binary.

Post-structural criticism of binary oppositions is not simply the reversal of the opposition, but its deconstruction, which is described as apolitical—that is, not intrinsically favoring one arm of a binary opposition over the other. Deconstruction is the &quot;event&quot; or &quot;moment&quot; at which a binary opposition is thought to contradict itself, and undermine its own authority.

Deconstruction assumes that all binary oppositions need to be analyzed and criticized in all their manifestations; the function of both logical and axiological oppositions must be studied in all discourses that provide meaning and values. But deconstruction does not only expose how oppositions work and how meaning and values are produced in a nihilistic or cynic position, &quot;thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively&quot;. To be effective, and simply as its mode of practice, deconstruction creates new notions or concepts, not to synthesize the terms in opposition but to mark their difference, undecidability, and eternal interplay.

==In relation to logocentrism==
Logocentrism is an idea related to binary opposition that suggests certain audiences will favor one part of a binary opposition pair over the other. This favoritism is often most strongly influenced by readers&#x27; cultural backgrounds.

An example of such logocentrism is the strong patriarchal themes in &#x27;The Women and the Pot&#x27;, an Amharic folktale that tells the story of two women who are upset at their diminished role in society, and who consequently go to their King for help. He effectively conveys the message that women cannot be relied upon to take on a greater role in society, which becomes the moral of the tale. Prasad explains this idea: &quot;The logocentric value is seen through the &#x27;Eternal Knowledge&#x27;—the naturalness of male superiority—that is conveyed through the folktale. The hidden a priori binary opposition is &#x27;Man over Woman&#x27;.&quot; In relation to the cultural heritage of an audience having an influence on their unconscious preference for one part of binary opposition, Prasad says; &quot;By way of studying a selection of Ethiopian folktales, the paper uncovers the presence of logocentrism and a priori binary opposition being at work in Ethiopian folktales. These two elements attempt to endorse and validate the &#x27;given&#x27; subservient position of women in society&quot;.

==In literature==
Binary opposition is deeply embedded within literature as language, and paired opposites, rely upon a relation with adjoining words inside a paradigmatic chain. If one of the paired opposites were removed the other&#x27;s precise meaning would be altered.

<text>James Alexander Renwick (November 29, 1917 – November 28, 1984) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1964 to 1984 who represented the downtown Toronto riding of Riverdale. He served as president of the Federal New Democratic Party from 1967 to 1969. He died while still in office.

==Background==
Renwick came from a relatively privileged background. He attended Trinity College at the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School, and enlisted with the Canadian Army during World War II. He reached the rank of captain, and became an adjutant with the Canadian Armored Corps in the 28th Armored Regiment. He was captured by the Nazis at Falaise following D-Day, and was a prisoner-of-war for a time.

After returning to Canada, Renwick finished his legal studies in 1947 and became a corporate lawyer. Attorney-General Roy McMurtry, characterized Renwick as &quot;one of the most brilliant corporate lawyers of his generation.&quot;

==Politics==
He was impressed by the newly formed New Democratic Party (NDP), and joined the democratic socialist party after attending the Ontario New Democratic Party&#x27;s 1962 convention. He campaigned for the Ontario party in the 1963 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Stanley Randall by 4,456 votes in the Toronto constituency of Don Mills.

The next year, Renwick became the NDP&#x27;s candidate for a by-election in the downtown Toronto riding of Riverdale, against Ontario Liberal leadership candidate Charles Templeton. Renwick&#x27;s campaign team, led by future Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis, developed an innovative technique of going door to door three times during the campaign to identify the party&#x27;s likeliest voters, and then &quot;pulling the vote&quot; on election day. This system maximized the NDP&#x27;s vote on election day and increased the overall turnout to over 60%, about one-third higher than the usual turnout for a by-election. The result was an upset victory for Renwick, while Templeton fell to third place. This campaign system was adopted by the NDP throughout Ontario, and was later copied by other parties.

The NDP experienced a major breakthrough in the 1967 provincial election, greatly increasing its representation in the legislature and emerging particularly strong in Toronto. Among the victors was Renwick&#x27;s wife Margaret, who was elected in Scarborough Centre. Jim and Margaret Renwick were the first husband and wife ever to serve simultaneously in a Canadian provincial or federal legislature.

Despite this, many party members, and members of caucus, believed the party could have done better under new leadership. Donald C. MacDonald had led the Ontario NDP and its predecessor, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, since 1953, and was seen as out of touch with the younger, more radical mood of the 1960s. Renwick was persuaded to challenge MacDonald for the party leadership in 1968, but was defeated in a leadership vote.

Renwick was re-elected in 1971, 1975, 1977 and 1981, and remained a Member of Provincial Parliament until his death. Renwick was elected president of the federal NDP in 1967. In 1982, he was a prominent supporter of Richard Johnston&#x27;s bid to lead the provincial NDP.

During his time in the legislature he was described as an &quot;independent thinker and a tough and knowledgeable critic&quot; of matters concerning law and justice. He died on November 28, 1984, after suffering a heart attack.

<text>HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot; is a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy and later served as a civilian research vessel. She is now a museum ship located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the last surviving Flower-class corvette.

==Wartime service==
&quot;Sackville&quot;″s keel was laid down as &quot;Patrol Vessel 2&quot; at the Saint John Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Saint John, New Brunswick in early 1940, the second of the s ordered by the Royal Canadian Navy. She was launched on 15 May 1941 by Mrs. J. E. W. Oland, wife of the captain of the port, with the Mayor and entire town council of her namesake town in attendance. &quot;Sackville&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 December 1941 by Captain J. E. W. Oland, husband of the ship&#x27;s sponsor. Her first commanding officer, Lieutenant W. R. Kirkland, RCNR was appointed on 30 December but did not join &quot;Sackville&quot; until 2 January. Kirkland was discharged in March 1942 as &quot;unsuitable&quot; after a poor working-up trip to Newfoundland in late February. The first lieutenant reported that Kirkland had been unable to discharge his duties and had been abusive to his officers. After rescuing the survivors from the sunken Greek ship &quot;Lily&quot;, &quot;Sackville&quot; was unable to re-locate her convoy, ONS 68. The first lieutenant then took the step of relieving Kirkland and assuming command. The original crew was reposted to other RCN ships and the already trained crew of under Lieutenant-Commander Alan H. Easton, RCNR was drafted onto the ship on 6 April 1942. Also in April &quot;Sackville&quot; received Canadian-built SW1C radar and worked up at Halifax and St. Margarets Bay.

The ship was finally assigned to Escort Group C-3 of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force along with two others ( and ) on 15 May 1942 to replace corvettes going for refit. In August 1942 &quot;Sackville&quot; fought a series of fierce actions escorting Convoy ON-115. Deprived of air cover by heavy fog, the convoy was attacked by two successive U-boat &quot;wolfpacks&quot; off the coast of Newfoundland. On August 3, &quot;Sackville&quot; caught the German submarine on the surface and, as the submarine dived, made a series of depth charge attacks which badly damaged the submarine. &quot;U-43&quot; survived but had to retreat to France for repairs with serious damage to its engines, compressors, a leaking hatch and a crewman with internal injuries. The next day &quot;Sackville&quot; attacked as it dived, causing the submarine to break off its attack leaving &quot;Sackville&quot; to rescue two survivors from an abandoned but still floating merchant ship. Only a few hours later, &quot;Sackville&quot; detected on the surface with radar and landed a four-inch shell on the submarine&#x27;s conning tower followed by a depth charge. &quot;U-552&quot; nearly sank but managed to regain control and creep back to Germany heavily damaged. &quot;Sackville&quot;″s attacks had played a key role in allowing the 41 ship convoy to escape with the loss of only two ships.

&quot;Sackville&quot; continued in her escort role until starting an extensive refit at Thompson Bros. Machinery Co. Ltd. in Liverpool, Nova Scotia in January 1943. She returned to service in April and was assigned to Escort Group C-1 where she remained until reassigned to a new group Escort Group 9 in July. The group was disbanded following the loss of three of its ships on 20–22 September and the ship assigned to group C-2, where the ship remained on Atlantic escort work until going for refit in Galveston, Texas in February 1944.

Returning to Halifax in May 1944 the vessel worked up in Bermuda and was then assigned to Escort Group C-2 which left for Derry escorting convoy HX-297 on 29 June 1944.

At Derry the boilers were cleaned, which revealed a serious leak in one of them. Repairs were unsuccessful and the ship was no longer considered suitable for convoy escort work. Since the ship had only recently been modernized she was reassigned for training at on 29 August 1944.

However, almost immediately afterwards the decision was made to convert her to a loop layer, laying anti-submarine indicator loops across harbour entrances, her damaged boiler removed to provide storage for the cable and the 4-inch gun replaced with a pair of cranes. She remained in this role until paid off in April 1946 and laid up in reserve.

===Trans-Atlantic convoys escorted===
==Civilian service==
Most Flower-class corvettes were scrapped shortly after the war, however &quot;Sackville&quot; was laid up in reserve. She was reactivated in 1952 and converted to a research vessel for the Department of Marine and Fisheries. The armament was removed, the hull repainted black in place of the original dazzle camouflage and the new pennant number 532 painted on the hull (changed to 113 in the late 1950s). A laboratory was built on the aft superstructure in 1964 and the bridge enclosed in 1968. She remained in service until December 1982, with her last cruise in July 1982.

==Museum ship==

The original intention had been to acquire , which had been sold to the Dominican Republic and renamed &quot;Juan Alejandro Acosta&quot; but this vessel was wrecked (along with another Flower-class corvette - &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot;, the former ) by Hurricane David in 1979. This left &quot;Sackville&quot; as the sole remaining Flower-class corvette.

The ship was transferred to the Canadian Naval Corvette Trust (now the Canadian Naval Memorial Trust) on 28 October 1983 and restored to her 1944 appearance (apart from minor details in her camouflage and the presence of the &quot;barber pole&quot; red and white pattern around her funnel which had been removed before 1944). It had originally been planned to restore the ship to her 1942 appearance but this proved too expensive.

She currently serves the summer months as a museum ship moored beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while spending her winters securely in the naval dockyard at CFB Halifax under the care of Maritime Forces Atlantic, the Atlantic fleet of Royal Canadian Navy. &quot;Sackville&quot;″s presence in Halifax is considered appropriate, as the port was an important North American convoy assembly port during the war.

In September 2003, &quot;Sackville&quot; broke loose during Hurricane Juan and struck the schooner &quot;Larinda&quot;, a yacht inspired by the 1767 Boston schooner , moored beside her. The schooner&#x27;s owners sued the Naval Memorial Trust in 2009 but the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Sackville&quot;″s favour on 4 August 2011, concluding that the Trust had taken all necessary and appropriate precautions to secure &quot;Sackville&quot;.

&quot;Sackville&quot; makes her first appearance each spring when she is towed by a naval tugboat from HMC Dockyard to a location off Point Pleasant Park on the first Sunday in May to participate in the &quot;Commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic&quot; ceremonies held at a memorial in the park overlooking the entrance to Halifax Harbour. &quot;Sackville&quot; typically hosts several dozen Royal Canadian Navy veterans on this day and has also participated in several burials at sea for dispersing the ashes of Royal Canadian Navy veterans of the Battle of the Atlantic at this location. In 2018, the ship underwent CAN$3.5 million in repairs at CFB Halifax.

==Recognition==
In 1988, &quot;Sackville&quot; was designated a National Historic Site of Canada, due to her status as the last Flower-class corvette known to exist.

On 4 November 1998, Canada Post issued a 45¢ stamp featuring HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot; as part of the Naval Vessels series. The stamps were designed by Dennis George Page, based on an illustration by Todd Hawkins and on photographs by Canadian Naval Memorial Trust.

==HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot; memorial centre==
 plans were being looked at for a $50 million memorial centre which could include a permanent land based berth for the ship, as well as a Canadian Naval memorial and museum.

HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot; underwent a major refit from February through October 2018.

==&quot;Greyhound&quot;==

HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot; was used as the model for the corvette, HMCS &quot;Dodge&quot;, call sign Dicky, in the 2020 film, &quot;Greyhound&quot;. The producers of the movie took numerous 3D scans of the ship&#x27;s exterior to create the CGI version for the movie.

<doc id="1058920" wikidata="Q1418140" url="?curid=1058920" title="Woodcraft (youth movement)">
<text>Woodcraft is a recreational/educational program devised by Ernest Thompson Seton in 1902, for young people based on camping, outdoor skills, and woodcrafts. Thompson Seton&#x27;s Woodcraft ideas were incorporated into the early Scout movement, but also in many other organisations in many countries.

== United States ==

Formally established in Los Angeles in 1922, the largest and most active Woodcraft organization is Los Angeles&#x27; Woodcraft Rangers, which has a history of providing programs for children in the under-served areas of greater Los Angeles. Currently, Woodcraft Rangers reaches out to over 18,000 at-risk young people annually through enriching after-school and camping programs. The organization&#x27;s programs are responsive to social trends and designed to help children mature into healthy, productive adults through positive experiences and age-appropriate challenges. Over the decades Woodcraft Rangers have modified Seton&#x27;s original emphasis on outdoor life to incorporate activities that meet the needs of an increasingly urban population, but the goal of changing behavior and encouraging positive outcomes through interaction and education remains central to what they do today. By providing structured activities, a safe environment, and adult guidance after school, Woodcraft Rangers offers a positive alternative to the boredom and negative peer pressures that can lead to juvenile delinquency. As it has since Seton&#x27;s time, the agency&#x27;s American Camp Association accredited summer camp programs at Blue Sky Meadow focus on outdoor living skills and nature activities. Campers are encouraged to explore and test their strengths and build character in a safe and supportive environment. After participating in nature hikes, archery, scavenger hunts, map &amp; compass adventures, arts &amp; crafts, survival skills games and star-gazing, campers return home with a better understanding of the outdoor world and greater confidence in their abilities. Summer camp also provides an opportunity for kids to just be kids – to have fun while forging lifelong friendships, developing important skills, and discovering new interests.

== Europe ==

In the United Kingdom, Quaker Ernest Westlake founded the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry in 1916. The OWC is the main, family-oriented group that holds activities and camps throughout the year in several Lodges. John Hargrave broke away from the OWC to found the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. Another of the active, surviving UK organisations is the Woodcraft Folk, a socialist group originally affiliated with the Co-Operative movement that broke away from Kibbo Kift in the 1920s. They hold weekly meetings similar to Scouts. Another breakaway from the OWC, Forest Schools, revived after World War II to form Forest School Camps taking urban children into country areas in the UK.

Many groups were founded elsewhere in Europe in the inter-war years. Typical was the Czech Woodcraft League, founded in the 1920s by Milos Seifert; it grew in its early years but was suppressed for half a century, first by the Nazis and then by the Communists. It survived by guile and misdirection, emerging with the fall of Communism, a small but dedicated organisation with members of all ages.

<doc id="1058921" wikidata="Q2997371" url="?curid=1058921" title="National LambdaRail">
<text>National LambdaRail (NLR) was a , high-speed national computer network owned and operated by the U.S. research and education community. In November 2011, the control of NLR was purchased from its university membership by a billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. NLR ceased operations in March 2014.

==Goals==
The goals of the National LambdaRail project were:
*Provide infrastructure for multipurpose advanced networking
*Allow multiple high-speed networks to be run simultaneously

==Description==

NLR used fiber-optic lines, and was the first transcontinental 10 Gigabit Ethernet network. Its high capacity (up to 1.6 Tbit/s aggregate), high bitrate (40 Gbit/s as of 2010; 100 Gbit/s as of 2011) and high availability (99.99% or more), enabled National LambdaRail to support demanding research projects. Users included NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and over 280 research universities and other laboratories. In 2009 National LambdaRail was selected to provide wide-area networking for U.S. laboratories participating in research related to the Large Hadron Collider project, based near Geneva, Switzerland.

It was primarily oriented to aid terascale computing efforts and to be used as a network testbed for experimentation with large-scale networks. National LambdaRail was a university-based and -owned initiative, in contrast to a university-corporate sponsorships such as Abilene Network and Internet2. National LambdaRail did not impose any acceptable use policies on its users, in contrast to commercial networks. This gave researchers more control to use the network for these research projects. National LambdaRail also supported a production layer, called &quot;PacketNet,&quot; on its infrastructure.

Links in the network used dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), which allows up to 64 individual optical wavelengths to be used (depending on hardware configuration at each end) separated by 100 GHz spacing. At present, individual wavelengths are used to carry traditional OC-X (OC3, OC12, OC48 or OC192) time-division multiplexing circuits or Ethernet signals for Gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet.

National LambdaRail was founded in 2003, completed its first phase in 2004, and reached fully-operational status on its national, advanced fiber optic network in 2006. In addition to being the first transcontinental, production 10 Gigabit Ethernet network, National LambdaRail was also the first intelligently managed, nationwide peering and transit program focused on research applications.

In 2008, a company named Darkstrand purchased capacity on NLR for commercial use.
By the end of the year the Chicago-based company was having trouble raising funding due to the Great Recession.
On May 24, 2012 the NLR network operations center services were transferred to the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California.
In October 2009 Glenn Ricart was named president and CEO.
On September 7, 2010 Ricart announced his resignation.

In November 2011 the control of NLR was purchased from its university membership by a billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong for $100M, who indicated his intention to upgrade NLR infrastructure and repurpose portions of it to support an ambitious healthcare project through NantHealth. The upgrade never took place. NLR ceased operations in March 2014.

== Member organizations ==
Members of National LambdaRail are state or regional optical networks, which provide connectivity to the individual universities and laboratories using NLR. NLR has 13 members which enable more than 280 research universities and government laboratories to connect to NLR. The following is a list, from the official National LambdaRail web site , of LambdaRail member organizations.

* The Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California
*Florida LambdaRail
*Front Range GigaPop / University Corporation for Atmospheric Research
*Lonestar Education and Research Network (LEARN)
*North Carolina Light Rail
*Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
*Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education

<doc id="1058923" wikidata="Q456582" url="?curid=1058923" title="Bill Brock">
<text>William Emerson Brock III (November 23, 1930 – March 25, 2021) was an American politician from Tennessee. A member of Republican Party, he served in both chambers of the United States Congress as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for four terms from 1963 to 1971 and a member of the U.S. Senate for one term from 1971 to 1977. He later served in the Cabinet of the United States from 1981 to 1987 under U.S. President Ronald Reagan. He was the grandson of William E. Brock Sr., a Democratic senator from Tennessee who served from 1929 to 1931.

==Early life and career==
Brock was born on November 23, 1930, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where his family owned a well-known candy company. He was the son of Myra (Kruesi) and William Emerson Brock Jr. Brock is named after his grandfather, William Emerson Brock, who also served in the U.S. Senate. His maternal great-grandfather was John Kruesi, a machinist and close Thomas Edison associate who was originally from Appenzell, Switzerland.

Brock was a 1949 graduate of The McCallie School and a 1953 graduate of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, in 1953 and subsequently served in the U.S. Navy until 1956. He then worked in his family&#x27;s candy business. Brock had been reared as a Democrat, but became a Republican in the 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to Congress from Tennessee&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, based in Chattanooga. The 3rd had long been the only Democratic outpost in traditionally heavily Republican East Tennessee; indeed, Brock&#x27;s victory ended 40 years of Democratic control in the district.

Underlining the district&#x27;s conservative bent, Brock was re-elected in 1964 by over nine points amid Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s 44-state landslide. He was again re-elected in 1966 and 1968. During Brock&#x27;s tenure in the House, he voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 but voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

==United States Senator==
Brock served four terms in the House and then won the Republican nomination to face three-term incumbent U.S. Senator Albert Gore Sr. in 1970, defeating country singer Tex Ritter in the primary. Brock&#x27;s campaign successfully made an issue of Gore&#x27;s friendship with the Kennedy family and Gore&#x27;s voting record, which was liberal by Southern standards, and defeated him.

While in the Senate, Brock was a darling of the conservative movement but was less popular at home; his personality was somewhat distant by the standards of most politicians. As a freshman U.S. senator, he accomplished a great deal even as a minority Republican. He was the original author of the Congressional Budget Act (S. 3984, 92nd Congress and S. 40, 93rd Congress) and as ranking minority of Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditures led the crafting of the Congressional Budget Bill. He sponsored credit legislation (Title V - Equal Credit Opportunity, H.R. 11211, 93rd Congress), memorialized by a National Archives and Records Administration exhibit, that provides woman&#x27;s access to credit, including credit cards, by requiring financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of credit to make credit equally available to all and not to discriminate on the &quot;basis of sex or marital status.&quot; He was co-chair of the Stevenson/Brock Committee (S. Res. 109, Temporary Select Committee to Study the Senate Committee System) with U.S. Senator Adlai Stevenson III of Illinois, which sponsored establishment of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee as well as workload, scheduling, and staffing reforms and importantly reorganization of committee jurisdictions.

As a member of Senate Finance Committee he promoted upgrading unemployment benefits, review of cash and non-cash benefits for low income, analysis of negative income tax experiments, transparency of markups, amendments to tax code, and introduced the first Senate tax indexing bill. Brock was a member of Paperwork Commission which according to Science&#x27;s &quot;Commission on Paperwork&quot; editorial (September 23, 1977) issued 25 reports and 750 recommendations for cutting paperwork saving $3.5 million annually. He also drafted a 1975 resolution providing personal committee staffing for junior members (S. Res 60). In all, he worked closely with a broad coalition of Democrats and Republicans to bring those with widely ranging views together. That was appreciated by professional committee staff and members. His efforts contributed greatly to Congress&#x27;s &quot;Era of Cooperation&quot; between 1971 and 1977 during which major reforms were accomplished including the Clean Water Act of 1972, Endangered Species Act of 1973, Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, all of which passed without opposition votes in the Senate.

He was considered vulnerable in the 1976 election cycle, and several prominent Democrats ran in the 1976 Democratic Senate primary for the right to challenge him. The most prominent and best-known name, at least initially, was probably 1970 gubernatorial nominee John Jay Hooker; somewhat surprisingly to most observers, the winner of the primary was Jim Sasser, who had managed Gore Sr.&#x27;s 1970 reelection campaign.

Sasser exploited lingering resentment of the Watergate scandal, which had concluded only about two years earlier. However his most effective campaign strategy was to emphasize how the affluent Brock, through skillful use of the tax code by his accountants, had paid less than $2,000 in income tax the previous year, an amount considerably less than that paid by many Tennesseans of far more modest means. Sasser was also aided by the popularity of the Democratic presidential candidate, Jimmy Carter, in Tennessee; the former Georgia Governor would win the state by a double-digit margin. Although Brock had started with a 30-point lead in polls over Sasser, Brock lost his re-election bid by a 47%–52% margin.

Prior to his Senate re-election run, Brock was among those considered to replace Nelson Rockefeller as President Gerald Ford&#x27;s running mate in the 1976 election.

==Later career==

After leaving the Senate, Brock became the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, a position he held from 1977 to 1981. Upon the election of Ronald Reagan as U.S. president, Brock was appointed U.S. Trade Representative, a position he maintained until 1985, when he was made United States Secretary of Labor.

Brock resigned his cabinet post in late 1987 to serve as the campaign manager for Senator Bob Dole&#x27;s presidential campaign. Dole, the runner-up to Vice President George H. W. Bush, was seen as a micromanager, who needed a strong personality like Brock to guide his campaign. Brock&#x27;s late start, in the fall of 1987, left little time to help find an avenue to cut into Bush&#x27;s substantial lead in national polls. Additionally, many viewed Brock as an imperious and inadequate manager, who badly misspent campaign funds largely on national headquarters staff and left Dole without adequate money for a Super Tuesday media buy. Dole and Brock had a public falling-out, and Brock publicly fired two of Dole&#x27;s favored consultants and ordering them off the campaign plane. Dole dropped out of the race in late March 1988 after he had lost key primaries in New Hampshire, the South, and Illinois. Brock became a consultant in the Washington, D.C., area. By that point, he had become a legal resident of Maryland. In 1994 he won the Republican U.S. Senate primary in Maryland over the future convict Ruthann Aron but was soundly defeated (41%–59%) in the general election by the Democratic incumbent, Paul Sarbanes.

In 1990, Brock was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Brock was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Personal life==
Brock married Laura Handly in 1957. They had four children and remained married until her death from cancer in 1985. He later married Sandra Schubert.
Brock died from pneumonia in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on March 25, 2021, at age 90.

<text>Panipat () is an industrial , located 95 km north of Delhi and 169 km south of Chandigarh on NH-44 in Panipat district, Haryana, India. It is famous for three major battles fought in 1526, 1556 and 1761. The city is also known as &#x27;city of weavers&#x27;, &#x27;textile city&#x27; and &#x27;cast-off clothes capital&#x27; of the world. It is home to industries like wool and cotton milling, saltpetre refining and manufacture of glass, electrical appliances, and other products. The city is included in the list of critically polluted industrial areas in India. As in Dec 2009, the Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index (CEPI) of the city was 59.00, as against 88.50 of Ankaleshwar (Gujarat). The three battles fought in the fatal field of Panipat changed the course of India&#x27;s history, first two resulting in creation and confirmation of the Mughal Empire. The third battle led to the decisive defeat of the Maratha Confederacy in North India, which had become a dominating power in Delhi by then and paved the way for the British Empire&#x27;s Company rule in India .

==Etymology==
Borrowed from Hindi पानीपत (pānīpat), Pani (water) Pat means (Bank) &quot;Panipat&quot;. As per another version, it is derived from Pandavprasth, i.e. &#x27;Pani&#x27; as a short form of &#x27;Pandav&#x27; and &#x27;pat&#x27; as a short form of &#x27;prasth&#x27;.

==History==
===Inception===
Panipat district was carved out from the erstwhile Karnal district on 1 November 1989. On 24 July 1991, it was again merged with Karnal district. On 1 January 1992, it again became a separate district.

====Reason behind the merger====
Panipat, while being carved out as a separate district firstly, included the &quot;Assandh Tehsil&quot; area. To add the &quot;Assandh Tehsil&quot; area back to Karnal, Panipat was merged with Karnal. Afterwards, Panipat was again carved out of Karnal for the second time, and excluded the &quot;Assandh Tehsil&quot; area. 

===Battles===

Panipat was the scene of three pivotal battles that changed the history of Indian Subcontinent.

====First====
The First Battle of Panipat was fought on 21 April 1526 between Ibrahim Lodhi, the Afghan Sultan of Delhi, and the Turko-Mongol warlord Babur, who later established Mughal rule in Northern Indian subcontinent. Babur&#x27;s force defeated Ibrahim&#x27;s much larger force of over one lakh (100,000) soldiers because of the technological advantage of field artillery. This first battle of Panipat thus ended the &#x27;Lodi Rule&#x27; established by Bahlul Lodhi in Delhi. This battle marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India.

====Second====
The Second Battle of Panipat was fought on 5 November 1556 between the forces of Akbar and Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, the last Hindu emperor of Delhi. Hem Chandra, who had captured states like Agra and Delhi defeating Akbar&#x27;s army and declared himself as independent king after a coronation on 7 October 1556 at Purana Qila in Delhi, had a large army, and initially his forces were winning, but suddenly he was struck by an arrow in the eye and fell unconscious. On not seeing him in his howdah on the back of an elephant, his army fled. The unconscious Hemu was carried to Akbar&#x27;s camp where Bairam Khan beheaded him. According to the historic sources Hemu and his army consisted of 1500 war elephants and a vanguard of artillery park.

Panipat is listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under Delhi Sarkar and supplying a force of 1000 infantry and 100 cavalry under Mughal Empire. It had a brick fort at the time which was also mentioned.

====Third====
The Third Battle of Panipat was fought on 14 January 1761. The Maratha Empire provoked the King of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Maratha Empire forces were led by Sadashivrao Bhau and the Afghans were led by Ahmad Shah Abdali. The Afghans had a 100,000 total strength of soldiers, and the Marathas had 50,000 soldiers and 120,000 pilgrims.

==Landmarks==

=== Hemu&#x27;s Samadhi Sthal ===
Self declared King Hemu with large force was captured by Shah Quli Khan in the Second Battle of Panipat and carried to the Mughal camp at Shodapur on Jind Road at Panipat. According to Badayuni, Bairam Khan asked Akbar to behead Hemu so that he could earn the title of &quot;Ghazi&quot;. Akbar replied, &quot;He is already dead, if he had any strength for a duel, I would have killed him.&quot; After Akbar&#x27;s refusal Hemu&#x27;s body was denied honour by the Mughal battle tradition and was unceremoniously beheaded by Bairam Khan. Hemu&#x27;s head was sent to Kabul where it was hung outside the Delhi Darwaza while his body was thrown outside gibbet in Delhi to warn his supporters, who were mainly his subjects, both the Muslims and Hindus.

===Ibrahim Lodhi&#x27;s Tomb===
It was one of Sher Shah Suri&#x27;s dying regrets that he could never fulfill his intention of erecting a tomb to the fallen monarch Ibrahim Lodhi. Much later, in 1866, the British relocated the tomb which was just a simple grave during construction of the Grand Trunk Road and added a platform to it with an inscription highlighting Ibrahim Lodhi&#x27;s death in the Battle of Panipat.

===Babur&#x27;s Kabuli Bagh Mosque===
The garden of Kabuli Bagh along with the Kabuli Bagh Mosque and a tank were built by Babur after the First Battle of Panipat to commemorate his victory over Ibrahim Lodhi. Some years later when Humayun defeated Sher Shah Suri near Panipat, he added a masonry Platform to it and called it &#x27;Chabutra&quot; Fateh Mubarak, bearing the inscription 934 Hijri (1557 CE). These buildings and the garden still exist under the name of Kabuli Bagh called so after Babur&#x27;s wife – Mussammat Kabuli begum.

===Kala Amb===

According to tradition, the site 8 km from Panipat and 42 km from Karnal, where Sadashiv Rao Bhau commanded his Maratha forces during the third battle of Panipat was marked by a black Mango Tree (Kala Amb) which has since disappeared. The dark colour of its foliage was probably the origin of the name. The site has a brick Pillar with an iron rod and the structure is surrounded by an iron fence. The site is being developed and beautified by a society presided over by the Governor of Haryana.

===Prachin Sidhh Shree Devi Mandir===
Shree Devi Mandir is one of the most appealing religious places in Panipat city. Standing along the &quot;Devi Mandir Road&quot; in the Tehsil Camp Locality and opposite to it is the &quot;Cygnus Maharaja Aggrasen Hospital&quot;. Here reside the idols of all the Hindu Gods and Goddesses. It used to have a large &quot;Sarovar&quot; (Water tank for religious practices), but it dried years ago due to a past drought that fell upon Panipat decades ago. It has now been converted into a lush green playground. If you are in Panipat do visit this temple, especially recommended during navratri festival fair.

==Panipat Syndrome==
The term &quot;Panipat Syndrome&quot; has entered the lexicon as the lack of strategic thinking, preparedness and decisive action by Indian leaders thus allowing an invading army to enter well inside their territory. This is based on the fact that in the three battles fought here, the defending armies were decisively defeated each time. It was coined by Air Commodore Jasjit Singh.

<doc id="1058954" wikidata="Q354331" url="?curid=1058954" title="Harry Stack Sullivan">
<text>Herbert &quot;Harry&quot; Stack Sullivan (February 21, 1892 – January 14, 1949) was an American Neo-Freudian psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who held that &quot;personality can never be isolated from the complex interpersonal relationships in which [a] person lives&quot; and that &quot;[t]he field of psychiatry is the field of interpersonal relations under any and all circumstances in which [such] relations exist&quot;. Having studied therapists Sigmund Freud, Adolf Meyer, and William Alanson White, he devoted years of clinical and research work to helping people with psychotic illness.

==Early life==
Sullivan was a child of Irish immigrants and grew up in the then anti-Catholic town of Norwich, New York, resulting in a social isolation that may have inspired his later interest in psychiatry. He attended the Smyrna Union School, then spent two years at Cornell University from 1909, receiving his medical degree in Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery in 1917.

==Work==
Along with Clara Thompson, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, Otto Allen Will Jr., Erik H. Erikson, and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Sullivan laid the groundwork for understanding the individual based on the network of relationships in which they are enmeshed. He developed a theory of psychiatry based on interpersonal relationships where cultural forces are largely responsible for mental illnesses &quot;(see also social psychiatry)&quot;. In his words, one must pay attention to the &quot;interactional&quot;, not the &quot;intrapsychic&quot;. This search for satisfaction via personal involvement with others led Sullivan to characterize loneliness as the most painful human experience. He also extended Freudian psychoanalysis to the treatment of patients with severe mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia.

Besides making the first mention of the significant other in psychological literature, Sullivan developed the idea of the &quot;Self system&quot;, a configuration of the personality traits developed in childhood and reinforced by positive affirmation and the security operations developed in childhood to avoid anxiety and threats to self-esteem. Sullivan further defined the Self System as a steering mechanism toward a series of I-You interlocking behaviors—that is, what an individual does is meant to elicit a particular reaction.

Sullivan called these behaviors Parataxical Integrations and noted that such action-reaction combinations can become rigid and dominate an adult&#x27;s thinking pattern, limiting their actions and reactions to the world as the adult sees it, not as it really is. The resulting inaccuracies in judgment Sullivan termed parataxic distortion, when other persons are perceived or evaluated based on the patterns of previous experience, similar to Freud&#x27;s notion of transference. Sullivan also introduced the concept of &quot;prototaxic communication&quot; as a more primitive, needy, infantile form of psychic interchange and &quot;syntactic communication&quot; as a mature style of emotional interaction.

Sullivan&#x27;s work on interpersonal relationships became the foundation of interpersonal psychoanalysis, a school of psychoanalytic theory and treatment that stresses detailed exploration of the nuances of patients&#x27; patterns of interacting with others.

Sullivan was the first to coin the term &quot;problems in living&quot; to describe the difficulties with self and others those with mental illnesses experience. This phrase was later picked up and popularized by Thomas Szasz, whose work was a foundational resource for the antipsychiatry movement. &quot;Problems in living&quot; went on to become the movement&#x27;s preferred way to refer to the manifestations of mental disturbances.

In 1927, he reviewed the controversial, anonymously published &quot;The Invert and his Social Adjustment&quot; and in 1929 called it &quot;a remarkable document by a homosexual man of refinement; intended primarily as a guide to the unfortunate sufferers of sexual inversion, and much less open to criticism than anything else of the kind so far published.&quot;

He was one of the founders of the William Alanson White Institute, considered by many the world&#x27;s leading independent psychoanalytic institute, and of the journal &quot;Psychiatry&quot; in 1937. He headed the Washington, D.C., School of Psychiatry from 1936 to 1947.

In 1940, he and colleague Winfred Overholser, serving on the American Psychiatric Society&#x27;s committee on Military Mobilization, formulated guidelines for the psychological screening of inductees to the U.S. military. He believed, writes one historian, &quot;that sexuality played a minimal role in causing mental disorders and that adult homosexuals should be accepted and left alone.&quot; Despite his best efforts, others included homosexuality as a disqualification for military service.

Beginning on December 5, 1940, Sullivan served as psychiatric adviser to Selective Service director Clarence A. Dykstra, but resigned in November 1941 after General Lewis B. Hershey, who was hostile to psychiatry, became the director. Sullivan then took part in establishing the Office of War Information in 1942.

==Personal life==
Sullivan spent the last 22 years of his life in a relationship with James Inscoe, who was 20 years younger than Sullivan. Although some contemporaries and historians have regarded Inscoe as an adopted son, the biography of his colleague Helen Swick Perry mentions the relationship, suggesting that close friends were aware they were partners.

Sullivan died in Paris in 1949.

==Writings==
Although Sullivan published little in his lifetime, he influenced generations of mental health professionals, especially through his lectures at Chestnut Lodge in Rockville, Maryland. Leston Havens called him the most important underground influence in American psychoanalysis. His ideas were collected and published posthumously, edited by Helen Swick Perry, who also published a detailed biography in 1982 (Perry, 1982, &quot;Psychiatrist of America&quot;).

==Works==
The following works are in Special Collections (MSA SC 5547) at the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis: Conceptions of Modern Psychiatry, Soundscriber Transcriptions (Feb. 1945-May 1945); Lectures 1-97 (begins Oct. 2, 1942); Georgetown University Medical School Lectures (1939); Personal Psychopathology (1929–1933); The Psychiatry of Character and its Deviations-undated notes.

His writings include:

#&quot;The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry&quot; (1953)
#&quot;The Psychiatric Interview&quot; (1954)
#&quot;Conceptions of Modern Psychiatry&quot; (1947/1966)
#&quot;Schizophrenia as a Human Process&quot; (1962)

<text>Brett David Whiteley (born 1 July 1960, Burnie, Tasmania) is an Australian politician. Whiteley was a Member of the House of Representatives representing the federal division of Braddon. He was elected at the 2013 federal election for the Liberal Party, defeating Labor&#x27;s Sid Sidebottom, but was defeated after one term by Labor&#x27;s Justine Keay at the 2016 federal election.

Prior to his election to federal parliament, Whiteley was a multi- Member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly representing the state electorate of Braddon from the 2002 state election until his defeat at the 2010 state election. In his first speech to state parliament, Whiteley stated that in 1993 he opened, in conjunction with two other people, a Christian training and retreat centre in Sheffield. He worked in this role for seven years. He served as an alderman for the City of Burnie from 1999 to 2002.

In November 2012, Whiteley was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the federal seat of Braddon. He won the seat against Labor&#x27;s Sid Sidebottom with a swing of 10.0 points.

Whiteley did not live in his electorate during the 2016 election campaign, but in neighbouring Lyons, at Squeaking Point near Port Sorell.

On 27 September 2015, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that Whiteley would replace Andrew Nikolic as a Government Whip in the House of Representatives. Whiteley lost his seat at the 2016 federal election to Labor candidate Justine Keay. He was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate in the 2018 Braddon by-election.

<text>Robert Cailliau (last name pronunciation: [kajo], born 26 January 1947) is a Belgian informatics engineer who proposed the first (pre-www) hypertext system for CERN in 1987 and collaborated with Tim Berners-Lee on the World Wide Web (jointly winning the ACM Software System Award) from before it got its name. He designed the historical logo of the WWW, organized the first International World Wide Web Conference at CERN in 1994 and helped transfer Web development from CERN to the global Web consortium in 1995. He is listed as co-author of &quot;How the Web Was Born&quot; by James Gillies, the first book-length account of the origins of the World Wide Web.

==Biography==
Cailliau was born in Tongeren, Belgium. In 1958 he moved with his parents to Antwerp. After secondary school he graduated from Ghent University in 1969 as civil, mechanical and electrical engineering (Dutch: Burgerlijk Werktuigkundig en Elektrotechnisch ingenieur). He also has an MSc from the University of Michigan in Computer, Information and Control Engineering, 1972.

During his military service in the Belgian Army, he maintained Fortran programs to simulate troop movements.

In December 1974 he started working at CERN as a Fellow in the Proton Synchrotron (PS) division, participating in the renovation project of the control system of the accelerator. In April 1987 he left the PS division to become group leader of Office Computing Systems in the Data Handling division. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a hypertext system for access to the many forms of documentation at and related to CERN. Berners-Lee created the system, calling it World Wide Web, between September and December 1990. During this time, Cailliau and he co-authored a proposal for funding for the activity. Cailliau later became a key proponent of CERN&#x27;s web activity, running several student projects to create and support browsers on different operating systems including various UNIX flavours and Classic Mac OS. With Nicola Pellow he helped develop the first web browser for the Classic Mac OS operating system called MacWWW.

In 1993, in collaboration with the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft Cailliau started the European Commission&#x27;s first web-based project for information dissemination in Europe (WISE). 

As a result of his work with CERN&#x27;s Legal Service, CERN&#x27;s director of Future Research Walter Hoogland signed the official document that released the web technology into the public domain on 30 April 1993.

In December 1993 Cailliau called for the first International WWW Conference which was held at CERN in May 1994. The oversubscribed conference brought together 380 web pioneers and was a milestone in the development of the web. The conference led to the forming of the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee which has organized an annual conference since then. Cailliau was founding member of the committee from 1994 until 2002.

In 1995 Cailliau started the &quot;Web for Schools&quot; project with the European Commission, introducing the web as a resource for education. After helping to transfer the web development from CERN to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), he devoted his time to public communication. He went on retirement from CERN in January 2007.

Cailliau was an active member of Newropeans, a pan-European political movement for which he and Luca Cominassi drafted a proposal concerning the European information society.

He was a public speaker on the past and future of the World Wide Web and has delivered many keynote speeches at international conferences. He currently has the status of External Collaborator at CERN IdeaSquare.

<doc id="1058969" wikidata="Q322453" url="?curid=1058969" title="Paimpol">
<text>Paimpol (; ) is a commune in the Côtes-d&#x27;Armor department in Brittany in northwest France.

It is a tourist destination, especially during the summer months when people are attracted by its port and beaches.

==Geography==
The town is located in the north of Brittany, at the western end of the bay of Saint-Brieuc, at the bottom of the bay of Paimpol.

The town is on the old national road D 786, 72 mi west of Saint-Malo, 23 mi north-west of Saint-Brieuc, 21 mi east of Lannion (sub-prefecture) and 44 mi to the north-east of Morlaix . Guingamp (sub-prefecture) is 18 mi to the south, and Rennes is 88 mi to the south-east.

==Population==

Inhabitants of Paimpol are called &quot;paimpolais&quot; in French. In 1960 Paimpol absorbed the former communes Kerity and Plounez. The population data given in the table below for 1954 and earlier refer to Paimpol proper, without Kerity and Plounez.

==Breton language==
The municipality launched a linguistic plan through Ya d&#x27;ar brezhoneg on 29 September 2008.

In 2008, 11.8% of primary school children attended bilingual schools.

==Transport==
Paimpol station is connected by trains to Guingamp station on the Paris-Montparnasse–Brest line.

==Sights==

Blue and white striped-jumpers are immediately visible in the streets and are seen to reflect not only their pride in all things to do with the sea, but also in their &quot;région&quot;, Brittany.

The town centre leads from the port down to the coast, through cobbled streets filled with restaurants, cafés and bars. The town centre includes the &quot;Quartier Latin&quot;. It was at La place du Martray that Pierre Loti chose to put the house of Gaud, the heroine of his novel &quot;Pêcheur d&#x27;Islande&quot;. The attractions of the town are also a major theme of Guy Ropartz&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Pays&quot; and Théodore Botrel&#x27;s song &quot;La Paimpolaise&quot;.

Other popular tourist sights include Beauport Abbey dating back to 1202, and the chapels of Lanvignec, Ste Barbe and Kergrist.
L&#x27;île de Bréhat is a rocky archipelago 10 minutes by ferry from the coast next to Paimpol. It is made up of two large islands connected by a bridge, and numerous smaller ones.

Other places of interest in the area include the Moulin de Craca and Circuit de falaises in Plouézec, as well as Pors-Even and the Tour de Kerroc&#x27;h in Ploubazlanec.

The Monument to Théodore Botrel in Paimpol is by Pierre Charles Lenoir

The has sculpture by André César Vermare

==Events==
Tourists are well catered for with regular events such as the Tuesday morning street market, night-markets, and &quot;Mardi du port&quot; – where tourists can enjoy diverse world music beside the port.

Paimpol is also home to the bi-annual &quot;Festival du chant de marin&quot; (sea shanty festival) which attracts thousands of visitors over three days in August.

<doc id="1058980" wikidata="Q631220" url="?curid=1058980" title="Braun (company)">
<text>Braun GmbH ( &quot;brown&quot;, ) is a German consumer products company founded in 1921 and based in Kronberg im Taunus. The company is known for its design aesthetic from the 1960s through the 1980s. It has manufactured a wide assortment of products ranging from electric shavers and personal care devices to radiograms and record players, movie cameras, slide projectors, clocks, and small kitchen appliances, for which &quot;Braun became shorthand for reliable, no-nonsense modernist goods.&quot;

==History==
In 1921, (1890–1951), a mechanical engineer, established a small engineering shop in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1923, he began producing components for radio sets. By 1928, the growing company moved to new premises on &quot;Idsteiner Strasse&quot;.

In 1929, eight years after he started his shop, Max Braun began to manufacture entire radio sets, and his company eventually became one of Germany&#x27;s leading radio manufacturers. This development continued with the launch of one of the first combined radio and record players, called radiograms, in 1932.

In 1935, the Braun brand was introduced, and the original incarnation of the logotype with the raised &quot;A&quot; was born. At the 1937 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, Max Braun received the award &quot;For special achievements in phonography&quot;. In support of the war effort during World War II, Braun discontinued making products for the civilian sector. In 1944, the Frankfurt factories were almost destroyed, and Max Braun began to rebuild his company.

After the war, Braun continued to produce state-of-the-art radios and audio equipment, and the company soon became well known for its &quot;high-fidelity&quot; audio and record players, including the famous SK line. Braun was the only foreign licensee of the QUAD electrostatic loudspeaker for a time. In 1954, the company also began producing film slide projectors, a mainstay of its business for the next forty years. By 1956, the company was marketing the first fully automatic tray film slide projector known as the PA 1.

The 1950s also marked the beginning of the product that Braun is known for today: the electric shaver. Braun&#x27;s first electric shaver, known as the S 50, was designed in 1938, but World War II delayed its introduction until 1951. It featured an oscillating cutter block with a very thin, yet very stable steel-foil mounted above it.

The 1950s also saw the start of kitchen appliances, like the mixer MX 3 and the kitchen machine (Küchenmaschine or kitchen machine) Braun KM 3. The KM 3 is a family of food processors that started with the model KM 3/31 in 1957. Designed by Gerd A. Müller, these machines were built in nearly unchanged form for 36 years until 1993.

In 1962, Braun became Braun AG, a publicly traded company. In 1963, the company started distributing microphones by U.S. manufacturer Shure in Germany. Also during the 1960s, Braun created the Rams-designed T3 pocket radio. By this time, Braun&#x27;s film slide projectors were featuring high-quality optics and all-metal construction combined with sleek functionalist styling, and competed with higher-end Eastman Kodak and Leitz products in the global market. Braun also started distributing in Germany high-end medium-format SLR system cameras produced by Japanese camera manufacturer Zenza Bronica, as well as Braun-Nizo brand cameras and Super 8 film cameras (formerly of Niezoldi &amp; Krämer GmbH; purchased by Braun in 1962). In 1967, the Boston, Massachusetts-based conglomerate Gillette Group acquired a majority share of the company.

Erwin Braun, one of Max Braun&#x27;s sons, took on the sales agency of the LECTRON system product line in 1967. He was very interested in making the teaching of electronics approachable to students all over the world. The LECTRON system was a simple but ingenious product that fit the bill perfectly. The LECTRON System was introduced to the German marketplace in 1966 by Egger-Bahn (a company primarily focused on the 9mm toy train sector). An electronic component, such as a resistor, was placed inside a transparent flat cube with a white cover on the top, which had the electronic symbol and its value. The blocks containing different components and types of connections could be put together to form a working circuit with the circuit schematic diagram illustrated by the symbols on the top of the block. The blocks were held together with magnets behind the conductive plates on the sides and bottom of the block. In 1972, due to pressure from Gillette, the LECTRON assets were sold off to Manfred Walter, the manager of the LECTRON product line at Braun. Mr. Walter formed Lectron, GmbH in 1972 to continue selling and developing the LECTRON product line. Mr. Walter retired and gifted the LECTRON assets to the Reha-Werkstatt Oberrad in 2001. The RWO continues to manufacture and sell the LECTRON system to this day.
By the 1970s, Braun discontinued its film slide projectors and hi-fi products to focus on consumer appliances such as shavers, razors, coffee makers, clocks, and radios. In 1981, the company&#x27;s audio and hi-fidelity division, which grew out of Braun&#x27;s former core business of radios, turntables, and hi-fidelity audio products, was spun off into Braun Electronic GmbH, a legally independent Gillette subsidiary. Braun Electronic GmbH put out its last audio-fi set in 1990 before the business was discontinued. Also, in the early 1980s, Braun sold its photographic and slide projector division to Robert Bosch GmbH.

In 1982, Gillette Group moved to integrate Braun with the parent company by taking full control over its operations. In 1984, Braun ceased the production of cigarette lighters. That same year, Braun became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gillette.

By the mid-1990s, Braun held a leading position among the world&#x27;s home appliance manufacturers, but profitability concerns began to surface. Many of Braun&#x27;s competitors closely imitated Braun designs and had them produced in low-cost labor countries at lower costs. The litigation commenced by the company to reverse the sales losses and damage to its product image cost Braun substantial amounts of money.

In 1998, Gillette decided to transform Braun AG into a private company before it bought back a 19.9 percent share in its subsidiary The Gillette Company Inc., which Braun had acquired in 1988. The following year, Braun&#x27;s sales organization was merged with those of Gillette&#x27;s other business divisions to cut costs. At the end of the 1990s, Braun and Gillette suffered losses in several areas. Looking for ways to return to profitability, Gillette considered the disposal of some of Braun&#x27;s less profitable divisions, such as kitchen appliances and thermometers, but abandoned the idea a few months later when no buyers were found. Braun&#x27;s sales in those areas began to recover in 2000.

Gillette was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble in 2005, making Braun a wholly owned subsidiary of P&amp;G. In 2006 Procter &amp; Gamble sold Braun&#x27;s Health Products division to Kaz, now a subsidiary of Helen of Troy Limited, along with licensing the use of Braun&#x27;s trademark in the specific health products market. In early 2008, P&amp;G discontinued sales of Braun appliances, except certain appliances such as shavers and electric toothbrushes, in the United States market. Elsewhere, however, Braun kept selling all its core categories until 2012, when the Braun product line relating to kitchen appliances was purchased by De&#x27;Longhi, using the Braun trademark under license from P&amp;G.

==Products==

Braun&#x27;s products include the following categories:

* Shaving and grooming (electric shaving, hair trimming, beard trimming)
* Oral care (now under the Oral-B brand)
* Beauty care (hair care and epilation)
* Health and wellness (ear thermometers, blood pressure monitors) (out-licensed)
* Food and drink preparation (coffee makers, coffee grinders, toasters, blenders, juicers) (out-licensed)
* Irons (out-licensed)
* Clocks, watches and calculators (out-licensed)

The company was formerly a manufacturer of food processors, radios, slide projectors, Super 8 film cameras and accessories, and high-fidelity sound systems.

Today, Braun focuses on its core categories (shaving and grooming, beauty, and hair care). Small household appliances, health and wellness categories, as well as clocks and watches are now run by other companies (De&#x27;Longhi, Zeon, Kaz) under license.

==Design department==

From the mid-1950s, the Braun brand was closely linked with the concept of German modern industrial design and its combination of functionality and technology. In 1956, Braun created its first design department, headed by , who instituted a collaboration with the Ulm School of Design to develop a new product line. In 1956 the company introduced its famous (&quot;Snow White&#x27;s Coffin&quot;), designed by a youthful Dieter Rams together with Herbert Lindinger and the pioneer of system design, Hans Gugelot, then lecturer of design at the Ulm School of Design. Rams soon became the most influential designer at Braun, and was a key figure in the German design renaissance of the late 1950s and 1960s. Eventually becoming head of Braun&#x27;s design staff, Rams&#x27; influence was soon evidenced in many products. Braun&#x27;s audio equipment and the high-quality &quot;D&quot;-series (D25–D47) 35mm slide projectors from this period are some of the better examples of Functionalist design.

Another icon of modern design, but less well known, is the LE1 electrostatic loudspeaker unit (for which technological aspects were licensed from the British company QUAD). Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs are also responsible for the classic range of Braun alarm clocks, collaborating first on the design &quot;Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III&quot; in the early 1970s, and later, the AB 20 in 1975, followed by a number of other models. These designs were discontinued by Braun in 2005.

In the 1970s, a design approach influenced by pop art began to inspire Braun products, which included many common household appliances and products. Contemporary Braun design of the period incorporated this new approach in bright colours and a lightness of touch while still clean-lined in keeping with functionalist philosophy.

For nearly 30 years Dieter Rams served as head of design for Braun A.G. until his retirement in 1995, when Peter Schneider succeeded him. Other designers who worked in Braun&#x27;s design department include Gerd Alfred Muller, Reinhold Weiss, Richard Fischer, Robert Oberheim, Florian Seiffert, Hartwig Kahlcke, Herbert Hirche, , , and Ludwig Littmann. Many of the designs that Rams and the Braun design department produced – from coffee makes to calculators and radios to razors – are held in the collections of museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and the Museum für Angewandte Kunst in Frankfurt.
The work of the Braun design department, and especially the Ten Principles of Good design as defined by Rams, influenced both Steve Jobs and Apple designer Jonathan Ive. 

The designer Jasper Morrison has spoken about his grandfather&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&#x27;s Coffin&quot; being an &quot;important influence on [his] choice in becoming a designer.&quot;

More recent collaborations which highlight the ongoing influence of the work of the Braun design department have included projects such as Braun wristwatches designed by Paul Smith, and Virgil Abloh&#x27;s re-working of the classic BC02 alarm clock for his Off-White brand, which sought to &quot;open up the conversation on the role of design today.&quot;

<doc id="1058983" wikidata="Q968447" url="?curid=1058983" title="Triangular theory of love">
<text>The triangular theory of love is a theory of love developed by Robert Sternberg. In the context of interpersonal relationships, &quot;the three components of love, according to the triangular theory, are an intimacy component, a passion component, and a commitment component.&quot;

Sternberg says that intimacy refers to &quot;feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness in loving relationships,&quot; passion refers to &quot;the drives that lead to romance, physical attraction, sexual consummation, and related phenomena in loving relationships&quot; and decision/commitment means different things in the short and long term. In the short-term, it refers to &quot;the decision that one loves a certain other&quot;, and in the long-term, it refers to &quot;one&#x27;s commitment to maintain that love.&quot;

==Components==
The three components of love as described in the theory are as follows:

=== Passion ===
Passion can be associated with either physical arousal or emotional stimulation. Passion is defined in three ways:

# A strong feeling of enthusiasm or excitement for something or about doing something
# A strong feeling (such as anger) that causes people to act in a dangerous way
# Strong sexual and romantic feeling for someone

=== Intimacy ===
Intimacy is described as the feelings of closeness and attachment to one another. This tends to strengthen the tight bond that is shared between those two individuals. Additionally, having a sense of intimacy helps create the feeling of being at ease with one another, in the sense that the two parties are mutual in their feelings.

Intimacy is primarily defined as something of a personal or private nature; familiarity.

=== Commitment ===
Unlike the other two blocks, commitment involves a conscious decision to stick with one another. The decision to remain committed is mainly determined by the level of satisfaction that a partner derives from the relationship. There are three ways to define commitment:

# A promise to do or give something.
# A promise to be loyal to someone or something.
# The attitude of someone who works very hard to do or support something.

&quot;The amount of love one experiences depends on the absolute strength of these three components, and the type of love one experiences depends on their strengths relative to each other.&quot; Different stages and types of love can be explained as different combinations of these three elements; for example, the relative emphasis of each component changes over time as an adult romantic relationship develops. A relationship based on a single element is less likely to survive than one based on two or three elements.

==Influences==

Of the multiple different early and later theories of love, there are two specific early theories that contribute to and influence Sternberg&#x27;s theory.

The first is a theory presented by Zick Rubin named The Theory of Liking vs. Loving. In his theory, to define romantic love, Rubin concludes that attachment, caring, and intimacy are the three main principles that are key to the difference of liking one person and loving them. Rubin states that if a person simply enjoys another&#x27;s presence and spending time with them, that person only likes the other. However, if a person shares a strong desire for intimacy and contact, as well as cares equally about the other&#x27;s needs and their own, the person loves the other. In Sternberg&#x27;s theory, one of his main principles is intimacy. It is clear that intimacy is an important aspect of love, ultimately using it to help define the difference between compassionate and passionate love.

The second, presented by John Lee, is the color wheel model of love. In his theory, using the analogy of primary colors to love, Lee defines the three different styles of love: Eros, Ludus, and Storge. Most importantly within his theory, he concludes that these three primary styles, like the making of complementary colors, can be combined to make secondary forms of love. In Sternberg&#x27;s theory, he presents, like Lee, that through the combination of his three main principles, different forms of love are created.

Sternberg also described three models of love, including the Spearmanian, Thomsonian, and Thurstonian models. According to the Spearmanian model, love is a single bundle of positive feelings. In the Thomsonian model, love is a mixture of multiple feeling that, when brought together, produce the feeling. The Thurstonian model is the closest to the triangular theory of love, and posits that love is made up of a set of feelings of approximately equal importance that are best understood on their own rather than as an integrated whole. In this model, these various factors contribute simultaneously to the experience of love, and can be disconnected from each other.

==Elaboration==

Sternberg&#x27;s triangular theory of love was developed after the identification of passionate love and companionate love. Passionate love is focused on the present at the onset of a relationship, while companionate love endures and grows over time with deep meanings in that relationship. Both are different kinds of love but are connected in relationships.

Passionate love is associated with strong feelings of love and desire for a specific person. This love is full of excitement and novelty. Passionate love is important in the beginning of the relationship and typically lasts 3-12 months. There is a chemical component to passionate love; those experiencing it enjoy an increase in the neurotransmitters phenylethylamine and oxytocin. There is empirical research, particularly from linking love to the opioid circuit in the brain. These feelings are most commonly found in the most early stages of love.

Companionate love follows passionate love. Companionate love is also known as affectionate love. When a couple reaches this level of love, they feel mutual understanding and care for each other. This love is important for the survival of the relationship. This type of love comes later on in the relationship and requires a certain level of knowledge in each person in the relationship.

Sternberg created his triangle next. The triangle&#x27;s points are intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Intimate love is the corner of the triangle that encompasses the close bonds of loving relationships. Intimate love felt between two people means that they each feel a sense of high regard for the other. They wish to make each other happy, share with each other, be in communication with each other, help when one is in need. Two people with intimate love deeply value each other. Intimate love has been called the &quot;warm&quot; love because of the way it brings two people close together. Sternberg predicted that intimacy levels would decline in longer relationships, but this was not borne out in a later study.

Passionate love is based on drive. Couples in passionate love feel physically attracted to each other. Sexual desire is typically a component of passionate love. Passionate love is not limited to sexual attraction, however. It is a way for couples to express feelings of nurture, dominance, submission, self-actualization, etc. Passionate love is considered the &quot;hot&quot; component of love because of the strong presence of arousal between two people. Sternberg believed that passionate love would diminish as the positive force of the relationship is taken over by opposite forces. This idea comes from Solomon&#x27;s opponent-force theory. But the study mentioned earlier found this to be true only for females.

Commitment, or committed love, is that of lovers who are committed to being together for a long period of time. Something to note about commitment, however, is that one can be committed to someone without feeling the other two loves for him or her, and one can feel the other two loves for someone without being committed to him or her. Commitment is considered to be the &quot;cold&quot; love because it does not require either intimacy or passion. Sternberg believed that committed love increases in intensity as the relationship grows. Commitment can be present with friends as well.

Sternberg believed love to progress and evolve in predictable ways—that all couples in love will experience intimate, passionate, and committed love in the same patterns.

Although these types of love may contain qualities that exist in non-loving relationships, they are specific to loving relationships. A description of non-love is listed below, along with the other kinds of love. These kinds of love are combinations of one or two of the three corners of Sternberg&#x27;s triangle of love.

==Forms of love==

The three components, pictorially labeled on the vertices of a triangle, interact with each other and with the actions they produce so as to form seven different kinds of love experiences (nonlove is not represented). The size of the triangle functions to represent the &quot;amount&quot; of love—the bigger the triangle, the greater the love. Each corner has its own type of love and provides different combinations to create different types of love and labels for them. The shape of the triangle functions to represent the &quot;style&quot; of love, which may vary over the course of the relationship:

*Non-love The absence of any of the three types of love. No connection. Indifferent to relationship. 
*Liking/friendship This type of love is intimacy without passion or commitment. This includes friendships and acquaintances.
*Infatuated love: Infatuated love is passion without intimacy or commitment. This is considered &quot;puppy love&quot; or relationships that have not become serious yet. Romantic relationships often start out as infatuated love and become romantic love as intimacy develops over time. Without developing intimacy or commitment, infatuated love may disappear suddenly.
*Empty love is characterized by commitment without intimacy or passion. A stronger love may deteriorate into empty love. In an arranged marriage, the spouses&#x27; relationship may begin as empty love and develop into another form, indicating &quot;how empty love need not be the terminal state of a long-term relationship ... [but] the beginning rather than the end&quot;.
*Romantic love This love is passionate and intimate but has no commitment. This could be a romantic affair or a one-night stand.
*Companionate love is an intimate, non-passionate type of love that is stronger than friendship because of the element of long-term commitment. &quot;This type of love is observed in long-term marriages where passion is no longer present&quot; but where a deep affection and commitment remain. The love ideally shared between family members is a form of companionate love, as is the love between close friends who have a platonic but strong friendship.
*Fatuous love can be exemplified by a whirlwind courtship and marriage—it has points of passion and commitment but no intimacy. An example of this is infatuation.
*Consummate love is the complete form of love. Of the seven varieties of love, consummate love is theorized to be that associated with the &quot;perfect couple&quot;. According to Sternberg, these couples will continue to have sex fifteen years or more into the relationship, they cannot imagine themselves happier over the long-term with anyone else, they overcome their few difficulties gracefully, and each delights in the relationship with the other. However, Sternberg cautions that maintaining a consummate love may be even harder than achieving it. He stresses the importance of translating the components of love into action. &quot;Without expression,&quot; he warns, &quot;even the greatest of loves can die.&quot; Thus, consummate love may not be permanent. If passion is lost over time, it may change into companionate love, which can be just as strong.
Sternberg&#x27;s triangular theory of love provides a strong foundation for his later theory of love, entitled Love as a Story. In this theory, he explains that the large numbers of unique and different love stories convey different ways of how love is understood. He believes that over time this exposure helps a person determine what love is or what it should be to them. These two theories create Sternberg&#x27;s duplex theory of love.

&quot;Personal relationships that have the greatest longevity and satisfaction are those in which partners are constantly working on sustaining intimacy and reinforcing commitment to each other.&quot;

==Support and criticism==

In a study done by Michele Acker and Mark Davis in 1992, Sternberg&#x27;s triangular theory of love was tested for validity. By studying a population that extended outside the typically studied group of 18- to 20-year-old college students, Acker and Davis were able to study more accurately the stages of love in people. Some criticism of Sternberg&#x27;s theory of love is that although he predicted the stages of a person&#x27;s love for another person, he did not specify a time or point in the relationship when the stages would evolve. He does not specify whether the different parts of love are dependent on duration of relationship or on the particular stage that relationship has reached. Acker and Davis point out that the stage and duration of the relationship are potentially important to the love component and explore them.

They find that there are no exact answers because not only each couple, but each individual in the couple experiences love in a different way. There are three perceptions of the triangular theory of love, or &quot;the possibility of multiple triangles&quot;. Multiple triangles can exist because individuals can experience each component of love (or point of the triangle) more intensely than another. These separate triangles, according to Acker and Davis and many others, are &#x27;real&#x27; triangles, &#x27;ideal&#x27; triangles, and &#x27;perceived&#x27; triangles.

These &#x27;real&#x27; triangles are indicative of how each individual views the progress and depth of his or her relationship. The &#x27;ideal&#x27; triangles are indicative of each individual&#x27;s ideal qualities of his or her partner/relationship. The &#x27;perceived&#x27; triangles are indicative of each individual&#x27;s ideas of how his or her partner is viewing the relationship. If any of these three separate triangles do not look the same as a person&#x27;s partner&#x27;s triangles, dissatisfaction is likely to increase.

Love may not be as simple as Sternberg&#x27;s triangular theory initially laid it out to be. Sternberg measured his theory on couples who were roughly the same age (mean age of 28) and whose relationship duration was roughly the same (4 to 5 years). His sample size was limited in characteristic variety. Acker and Davis announced this issue as being one of three major problems with Sternberg&#x27;s theory. Romantic love, in particular, is not often the same in undergraduate level couples as couples who are not undergrads. Acker and Davis studied a sample that was older than Sternberg&#x27;s sample of undergraduates. Sternberg himself did this in 1997.

The two other most obvious problems with Sternberg&#x27;s theory of love are as follows. The first is the question of the separate nature of the levels of love. The second is a question of the measures that have been used to assess the three levels of love. These problems with the theory continued to be studied, for example by Lomas (2018).

In a large-scale cross-cultural study published in the &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot; in 2020, the cultural universality of the theory was supported.

<text>Walter Frederick George Williams (8 October 1928 – 30 March 2018), better known by his stage name Bill Maynard, was an English comedian and actor. He began working in television in the 1950s, notably starring alongside Terry Scott in &quot;Great Scott – It&#x27;s Maynard!&quot; (1955–56). In the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in the successful British sitcoms &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt&quot; and &quot;The Gaffer&quot; and appeared in five films in the &quot;Carry On&quot; series. After a hiatus from television work in the late 1980s, Maynard starred as Claude Jeremiah Greengrass in the long-running television series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; from 1992 to 2000, reprising the character in the spin-off &quot;The Royal&quot; in 2003.

==Early life and career==
Walter Williams began as a variety performer in the 1950s, under the stage name of Bill Maynard the surname was inspired from seeing a billboard for the popular British confectionery, Maynard&#x27;s Wine Gums, when he was to do performances for the BBC. Maynard progressed to repertory theatre, touring army camps with Jon Pertwee. Maynard&#x27;s first television broadcast was on 12 September 1953 on Henry Hall&#x27;s &quot;Face the Music&quot;. For much of his career until the 1970s, his work was mostly towards performances: he entered and placed fourth in the British heat of the 1957 Eurovision Song Contest; he worked alongside Terry Scott for the TV series &quot;Great Scott – It&#x27;s Maynard!&quot;, after they worked together at Butlins Holiday Camp in Skegness; and he served as part of the news team on the &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; for Tyne Tees Television in Newcastle (1959–64). He also served for BBC Radio Leicester during the 1960s, until his departure in 1968.

In 1971, Maynard entered into acting, securing a role on Dennis Potter&#x27;s television play &quot;Paper Roses&quot;, which was about the last day in the life of a reporter, and then securing another role for Colin Welland&#x27;s television play, &quot;Kisses at Fifty&quot; in 1973. Around the same year, he worked with television actor and comedian Ronnie Barker in the (original) &quot;Football Blues&quot;, which aired as &quot;Spanners Eleven&quot;, and was part of a series called &quot;Seven of One&quot;. In 1974, Maynard became a subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Around the same time, Maynard went to work for Yorkshire Television, starring in a pilot episode for a new sitcom. In 1975, he published his autobiography, &quot;The Yo-Yo Man&quot;, with Leicester&#x27;s Golden Eagle books. Also in 1975 he appeared in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; episode &quot;Supersnout&quot; in which he played Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Quirk of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Flying Squad being the subject of a conspiracy by Joey Stickley, a dirty and weasley informant who attempts to ruin his reputation. After a pilot episode in 1974, Maynard took on the lead role in the sitcom &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt&quot; for three series, followed by its sequel &quot;Selwyn&quot; for one series, between 1976 and 1978. The Selwyn Froggitt role made Maynard a nationwide household name. In 1980, Maynard appeared in three episodes of &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; as Sergeant Beetroot, alongside long-time friend Jon Pertwee.

In 1981, Maynard starred in three series of the ITV sitcom &quot;The Gaffer&quot; until its conclusion two years later in 1983. In &quot;The Gaffer&quot;, Maynard played Fred Moffat, a downbeat, cynical and cunning character focused on survival who runs a struggling engineering firm, and who is constantly trying to avoid his creditors, the tax man, the bank manager, trade unionists at his engineering firm, and indeed seeking to avoid anyone who might want him to pay for something. The character of Fred Moffat was in contrast to the high profile, upbeat, good hearted, bumbling, casual labourer Selwyn Froggitt from his earlier sitcom, with the contrasts between the two even going as far as Fred Moffat having a beard and Selwyn Froggitt being clean shaven.

During the 1970s, Maynard secured roles in a number of films: he starred in five of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, including &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972) and &quot;Carry On Dick&quot; (1974). He starred as Mr. Lea alongside Anthony Booth, Robin Askwith and Doris Hare in all four films in the &quot;Confessions&quot; series of sex comedies and appeared in the 1976 film &quot;It Shouldn&#x27;t Happen to a Vet&quot;.

In April 1992, he returned to Yorkshire Television as lovable rogue Claude Jeremiah Greengrass in &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, a new ITV drama series set in the 1960s. It was a major success, consistently drawing over 10 million viewers. Maynard published a new book, &quot;Stand Up...And Be Counted&quot;, in 1997 with Breedon Books. He remained with &quot;Heartbeat&quot; until December 2000, when he decided to retire from the programme following a series of strokes. Despite this, he returned to acting in 2002 to reprise his character in spin off series &quot;The Royal&quot; until 2003. Maynard made a comeback to radio in March of that year on BBC Radio Leicester. His programme &quot;Bill of Fare&quot; aired every Sunday from 2pm to 4pm for nearly five years, until he was dismissed without notice on 5 February 2008.

In October 2009, he made a return to the stage when he appeared as the main guest of honour at the Pride of Bridlington Awards held in the East Riding of Yorkshire. By then, his career slowly wound down due to his age and impaired mobility from his strokes, whereupon his final television appearance was made on 14 April 2018 for an episode of &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;; filming took place prior to his death, while the episode aired 15 days after his death.

==Personal life==
Maynard was born in Farnham, Surrey, whereupon his family moved north to Leicestershire. He was educated at Kibworth Beauchamp Grammar School. Maynard lived in Sapcote, Leicestershire, during the latter part of his life.

He married Muriel Linnett on 5 November 1949, and they had two children. She died in June 1983. Maynard was a vegetarian. His son is musician Martin Maynard Williams.

Maynard was a supporter of the Labour Party, but in March 1984 Maynard stood against Tony Benn in the by-election at Chesterfield as an Independent Labour candidate, after objecting to the way that Benn became the official Labour Party candidate in a safe seat. Maynard took fourth place in the by-election.

On 4 September 1989, Maynard married actress and singer Tonia Bern, the widow of Donald Campbell, at Hinckley Registry Office. They divorced in 1998. Bern died on 14 June 2021.

In later life, having suffered multiple strokes which resulted in a reduction in his mobility, he used a scooter or wheelchair. He died in hospital on 30 March 2018, not long after falling and breaking his hip.

<text>James Francis Foulds (born April 10, 1937) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1987.

==Background==
Foulds was born in Port Arthur, Ontario (now Thunder Bay), Ontario, and educated at Lakehead Technical Institute and the University of British Columbia. He has been a member of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. His son Andrew is currently a city councillor for Thunder Bay City Council.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1971 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Charles Johnston by 1,369 votes in the riding of Port Arthur. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1975 election, and defeated PC candidate Allan Laakkonen by 339 votes in the 1977 election. He served as his party&#x27;s Education critic from 1971 to 1977, when he became Natural Resources critic.

Foulds defeated Laakkonen again in the 1981 election, even though the NDP lost seats under the leadership of Michael Cassidy. The following year, he ran to succeed Cassidy as party leader in a leadership convention. He competed against front runner Bob Rae and left-wing candidate Richard Johnston. Foulds had the most experience and supported traditional party positions. However, neither he nor Johnston with his appeal to the left wing of the party could stop Rae&#x27;s union backed bandwagon. He lost on the first ballot behind Rae (64.6%) and Johnston (24.4%) with 11.0% support.
 After the leadership convention, Foulds was named Deputy Leader.

Foulds was re-elected again in the 1985 election. The Progressive Conservatives, who had governed Ontario since 1943, were reduced to a tenuous minority government in this election, and were subsequently defeated in the legislature by an alliance of the Liberals and NDP. The Liberals formed government under David Peterson, and promised to implement some policies favoured by the NDP in return for support from that party in the legislature for two years. Foulds contributed to this accord by insisting that Peterson&#x27;s Liberal implement travel grants for necessary medical travel for northern Ontarians. He served as Treasury critic and Northern Affairs critic from 1985 to 1987, and did not run for re-election in 1987.

==Later life==
Foulds began teaching English at Westgate Collegiate and Vocational Institute in Thunder Bay. He has also taught a course in Ontario politics at Lakehead University since 1988.

Foulds remains active with the New Democratic Party, and supported Bill Blaikie for the federal party&#x27;s leadership in 2003. In 2005, he published an editorial in the Ontario party&#x27;s newsletter, arguing that voters should reject the arguments of right-wing politicians, and recognize that tax dollars and government intervention may be beneficial for society. If governments continue to pursue right-wing policies, he argues, &quot;we’re going to see more homelessness, more private health care, more private education, more gated communities, and more danger to your family and mine.&quot;

Although some media initially reported that Foulds was re-entering politics in the 2007 Ontario election as the New Democratic candidate in Thunder Bay—Superior North, the candidate in 2007 was not the former MPP, but a cousin of his with the same first name.

<text>The Meades Ranch Triangulation Station is a survey marker in Osborne County in the state of Kansas in the Midwestern United States. The marker was initially placed in 1891. From 1901, it was the reference location for establishing a system of horizontal measurement in the United States, known as geodetic datum. In 1913, the datum was adopted across all of North America, and the system revised and formalized as the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27). A similar reference for vertical measurement was established in 1929 as the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929. The NAD27 was later supplanted by the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which was formally adopted by the United States in 1989 and Canada in 1990; the new system moved the reference point to a point in the Earth&#x27;s core, and the Meades Ranch marker lost its special significance to the geodetic datum system.

In 1973, the site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the Geodetic Center of the United States.

==History==

In surveying, a geodetic datum is a point or set of points used to establish a coordinate system. By designating the location of one point, and the direction from that point to a second point, one can establish a system relative to which other points can be located and mapped. As one surveys a larger area over which the curvature of the Earth becomes significant, it also becomes necessary to define an ellipsoid: a curved surface that approximates the shape of the Earth in the area of interest.

The first nationwide datum in the United States was established in 1879. At that time, a region of contiguous triangulation existed from Maine to Georgia. The New England Datum was chosen with a benchmark in Maryland, near the middle of this region, as the horizontal datum, and a second Maryland mark used to define the azimuth (horizontal) direction. To account for the Earth&#x27;s curvature, the datum used a model called the Clarke spheroid, developed in 1866.

===Meades Ranch station===
The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey established a triangulation station, officially known as the Meades Ranch Triangulation Station, in 1891. The location lay near the intersection of two transcontinental arcs of triangulation: one running from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, roughly following the 39th parallel; the other running from Mexico to Canada, along the 98th meridian.

In 1901, the Meades Ranch station was chosen as the United States standard horizontal datum: the point relative to which all land measurements in the nation were made. The choice was based on the station&#x27;s location near the geographic center of the U.S. and near the intersection of the two arcs of triangulation, and because it minimized the number of changes in previously published positions. Its position was officially set as 39°13&#x27;26.686&quot; N and 98°32&#x27;30.506&quot; W; the azimuth direction to a triangulation station near Waldo, southwest of Meades Ranch, was officially set as 75°28&#x27;14.52&quot; west of south.

In 1913, the chief astronomer of the Dominion of Canada Astronomical Observatory and the director of the Comisión Geodésica Mexicana announced that their organizations would use the Meades Ranch location as their standard datum. In light of this, its name was changed to the &quot;North American Datum&quot;.

As more new surveys and previously isolated survey networks were incorporated into the system, it became increasingly difficult to make the necessary corrections. By the mid-1920s, it was realized that the coordinate system needed to be adjusted. From 1927 to 1932, the approximately 25,000 existing control locations were recalculated and a new coordinate system developed, known as NAD27. The new system continued to use the 1901 coordinates of Meades Ranch as its horizontal datum, and the Clarke spheroid as its model for the Earth&#x27;s surface. However, it now defined horizontal directions in terms of 175 Laplace azimuths, which use astronomical azimuths corrected for the difference between the astronomic and geodetic meridians. Under NAD27, the azimuth to the Waldo station changed by about 5&quot;.

In 1973, the Meades Ranch site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, under the name &quot;Geodetic Center of the United States&quot;.

===NAD83===
Following the establishment of NAD27, it was noted that it produced a discrepancy of about in latitudes in the northern part of the northern U.S. state of Michigan, necessitating a regional adjustment for the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. As the survey network was extended further north into Canada, similar discrepancies appeared. The problem proved to be systemic: It had been assumed that the differences between the Clarke spheroid and the actual geoid were negligible, whereas these differences actually introduced significant errors. The relatively small number and large separation of the points used to develop NAD27, the limited computational power available to its designers, and the movement of tectonic plates also led to inconsistencies in NAD27 coordinates.

To address these, a new datum was developed, designated NAD83. It replaced the Clarke spheroid with a new ellipsoid, the Geographic Reference System 1980, centered at the Earth&#x27;s center of mass as determined by the Bureau International de l&#x27;Heure. The new datum was based on adjustment of 250,000 points, including 600 satellite Doppler stations. NAD83 was officially adopted by the U.S. government in 1989, and by the Canadian government in 1990. Under the new system, Meades Ranch lost its special standing, and became one of thousands of stations.

==Description==
As of 2012, the location of the Meades Ranch station was {{coord|39|13|26.71220|N|98|32|31.74540|W|display=inline}} (in NAD83(2011); WGS 84 location may be very slightly off). It lies about {{convert|12|mi}} north of Lucas and about {{convert|10|mi}} southwest of Tipton.

The station is on a low grassy ridge in a pasture. It is marked by a bronze disc, inscribed &quot;Meades Ranch 1891&quot;, embedded in the top of a dome-shaped concrete marker {{convert|21|in|cm}} in diameter, rising about {{convert|4|in|cm}} above ground level. Two reference marks and an azimuth mark are located nearby.

The Meades Ranch station is on private land, with no public access. A replica of the station marker, with a Kansas historical marker explaining its significance, is located at {{coord|39.452286|-98.693542|display=inline|name=Meades Ranch replica}}, in a roadside rest area beside U.S. Highway 281 at the northern edge of Osborne, Kansas, {{convert|18|mi}} northwest of the Meades Ranch site.

<doc id="1058994" wikidata="Q7444837" url="?curid=1058994" title="Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol">
<text>The Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) is a US standard for secure voice and data communication, for circuit-switched one-to-one connections, not packet-switched networks. SCIP derived from the US Government Future Narrowband Digital Terminal (FNBDT) project.
SCIP supports a number of different modes, including national and multinational modes which employ different cryptography. Many nations and industries develop SCIP devices to support the multinational and national modes of SCIP.

SCIP has to operate over the wide variety of communications systems, including commercial land line telephone, military radios, communication satellites, Voice over IP and the several different cellular telephone standards. Therefore, it was designed to make no assumptions about the underlying channel other than a minimum bandwidth of 2400 Hz. It is similar to a dial-up modem in that once a connection is made, two SCIP phones first negotiate the parameters they need and then communicate in the best way possible.

US SCIP or FNBDT systems were used since 2001, beginning with the CONDOR secure cell phone. The standard is designed to cover wideband as well as narrowband voice and data security.

SCIP was designed by the Department of Defense Digital Voice Processor Consortium (DDVPC) in cooperation with the U.S. National Security Agency and is intended to solve problems with earlier NSA encryption systems for voice, including STU-III and Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) which made assumptions about the underlying communication systems that prevented interoperability with more modern wireless systems. STE sets can be upgraded to work with SCIP, but STU-III cannot. This has led to some resistance since various government agencies already own over 350,000 STU-III telephones at a cost of several thousand dollars each.

There are several components to the SCIP standard: key management, voice compression, encryption and a signalling plan for voice, data and multimedia applications.

==Key Management (120)==
To set up a secure call, a new Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) must be negotiated. For Type 1 security (classified calls), the SCIP signalling plan uses an enhanced FIREFLY messaging system for key exchange. FIREFLY is an NSA key management system based on public key cryptography. At least one commercial grade implementation uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

STEs use security tokens to limit use of the secure voice capability to authorized users while other SCIP devices only require a PIN code, 7 digits for Type 1 security, 4 digits for unclassified.

==Voice compression using Voice Coders (vocoders)==
SCIP can work with a variety of vocoders. The standard requires, as a minimum, support for the mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELP) coder, an enhanced MELP algorithm known as MELPe, with additional preprocessing, analyzer and synthesizer capabilities for improved intelligibility and noise robustness. The old MELP and the new MELPe are interoperable and both operate at 2400 bit/s, sending a 54 bit data frame every 22.5 milliseconds but the MELPe has optional additional rates of 1200 bit/s and 600 bit/s.

2400 bit/s MELPe is the only mandatory voice coder required for SCIP. Other voice coders can be supported in terminals. These can be used if all terminals involved in the call support the same coder (agreed during the negotiation stage of call setup) and the network can support the required throughput. G.729D is the most widely supported non-mandatory voice coder in SCIP terminals as it offers a good compromise between higher voice quality without dramatically increasing the required throughput.

==Encryption (SCIP 23x)==
The security used by the multinational and national modes of SCIP is defined by the SCIP 23x family of documents.
SCIP 231 defines AES based cryptography which can be used multinationally.
SCIP 232 defines an alternate multinational cryptographic solution.
Several nations have defined, or are defining, their own national security modes for SCIP.

==US National Mode (SCIP 230)==
SCIP 230 defines the cryptography of the US national mode of SCIP. The rest of this section refers to SCIP 230.
For security, SCIP uses a block cipher operating in counter mode. A new Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) is negotiated for each call. The block cipher is fed a 64-bit state vector (SV) as input. If the cipher&#x27;s block size is longer than 64 bits, a fixed filler is added. The output from the block cipher is xored with the MELP data frames to create the cipher text that is then transmitted.

The low-order two bits of the state vector are reserved for applications where the data frame is longer than the block cipher output. The next 42 bits are the counter. Four bits are used to represent the transmission mode. This allows more than one mode, e.g. voice and data, to operate at the same time with the same TEK. The high-order 16 bits are a sender ID. This allows multiple senders on a single channel to all use the same TEK. Note that since overall SCIP encryption is effectively a stream cipher, it is essential that the same state vector value never be used twice for a given TEK. At MELP data rates, a 42-bit counter allows a call over three thousand years long before the encryption repeats.

For Type 1 security, SCIP uses BATON, a 128-bit block design. With this or other 128-bit ciphers, such as AES, SCIP specifies that two data frames are encrypted with each cipher output bloc, the first beginning at bit 1, the second at bit 57 (i.e. the next byte boundary). At least one commercial grade implementation uses the Triple DES cipher.

==Signalling plan (210)==
The SCIP signalling plan is common to all national and multinational modes of SCIP. SCIP has two mandatory types of transmission. The mandatory data service uses an ARQ protocol with forward error correction (FEC) to ensure reliable transmission. The receiving station acknowledges accurate receipt of data blocks and can ask for a block to be re-transmitted, if necessary. For voice, SCIP simply sends a stream of voice data frames (typically MELPe frames, but possibly G.729D or another codec if that has been negotiated between the terminals). To save power on voice calls, SCIP stops sending if there is no speech input. A synchronization block is sent roughly twice a second in place of a data frame. The low order 14 bits of the encryption counter are sent with every sync block. The 14 bits are enough to cover a fade out of more than six minutes. Part of the rest of the state vector are sent as well so that with receipt of three sync blocks, the entire state vector is recovered. This handles longer fades and allows a station with the proper TEK to join a multi station net and be synchronized within 1.5 seconds.

== Availability ==
 a range of SCIP documents, including the SCIP-210 signalling standard, are publicly available from the IAD website.

Prior to this, SCIP specifications were not widely diffused or easily accessible. This made the protocol for government use rather &quot;opaque&quot; outside governments or defense industries.
No public implementation of the Type 1 security and transport protocols are available, precluding its security from being publicly verified.

<text>The Lucayan Archipelago, also known as the Bahamian Archipelago, is an island group comprising the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the British Overseas Territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands. The archipelago is in the western North Atlantic Ocean, north of Cuba and the other Antillean Islands, and east and south-east of Florida.

William Keegan writes: &quot;Modern political considerations aside, the islands form a single archipelago with common geological, ecological, and cultural roots.&quot; Though it is sometimes considered part of the Caribbean region, the Lucayan Archipelago is not geographically located within the Caribbean Sea.

== Countries and territories ==
* The Bahamas
* Turks and Caicos Islands (United Kingdom)

The Mouchoir Bank, the Silver Bank, and the Navidad Bank are a submerged continuation of the archipelago, to the southeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Mouchoir Bank is disputed between the Turks and Caicos Islands and Dominican Republic; Silver Bank and Navidad Bank are part of the Dominican Republic.

== Etymologies of island names ==
The Lucayan Archipelago was named for the original native Lucayan people. Julian Granberry and Gary Vescelius suggest the following Lucayan (Taíno) etymologies for various Lucayan islands.

<doc id="1059019" wikidata="Q844917" url="?curid=1059019" title="Gulf of Kutch">
<text>The Gulf of Kutch is located between the peninsula regions of Kutch and Saurashtra, bounded in the state of Gujarat that borders Pakistan. It opens towards the Arabian Sea facing the Gulf of Oman.

It is about 50 km wide at the entrance before narrowing into marshland, creeks and inlets. The south coast is bordered by islands, mud flats and coral reefs, due to the large amount of marine life found in this region it has large sections of it have become protected as parks and sanctuaries. The northern side is lined with extensive mud flats, the largest of which lie between Mundra and Kuvay. Also, a large portion of the shipping harbours in the region are located on the northern side including Māndvi, Bedi, and Kandla. Maximum depth of the Gulf of Kutch is around 123m (403 ft). Additionally, there are numerous shoals at the mouth of the gulf namely Lushington, Ranwara, Bobby and Gurur. The gulf expands deep into Gujarat with a length of approximately 150 km before becoming an 8500 km^2 delta. The low annual rainfall that flows into the gulf means that there are no major rivers going into the gulf and creating run-off.

Tidal conditions range with spring tide peaking around 6.2 m while the annual average is around 4 m. Moreover, the height of the tides can also vary depending on how deep into the gulf it&#x27;s recorded. Ohka has been measured in a range of 3.06 m while Kandla has shown heights of 5.89 m at the same time. Similarly, the speed of the current has been recorded between 1.5 to 2.5 knots at the entrance and 3 to 5 knots within the centre.

==History==
The Gulf of Kutch is referred to in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a travelogue written in about 50 CE, as the Gulf of Baraca.

==Biota ==
Wildlife diversity has been primarily monitored within the marine protected region with one study showing a recorded total of 1,127 species of fauna and flora. The total included 200 species of molluscs, 3 species of turtles, 3 species of marine mammals. Other studies have recorded hundred of species of fish.

Coral Reefs

The Gulf of Kutch contains fringing, platform and patch reefs as well as coral pinnacles with at least 37 different species of hard corals with other reports indicating 44 species of hard coral and 12 species of soft coral. These coral reefs are thousands of years old with the youngest being from 5,240 years old at Salaya although these coral clusters grow at a rate of 1 cm to 10 cm a year.

== Conservation ==
Conservation within the Gulf of Kutch have aimed to curb the collapse of local ecosystems in the last century. Before the Marine National Park and Sanctuary no government supported environment protect existed in the region. Conservation efforts have been extensive in maintaining a large area although the growing industrialisation, tourism and climate change marine diversity has been reduced.

=== The Gulf of Kutch Marine National Park and Sanctuary ===

The Gulf of Kutch Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNPS) was established in 1980 with the creation of the first marine sanctuary and park in response to a number of notifications received by the state of Gujarat. These first installations covered the islands that are located along the coast of Saurashtra with the inter tidal sectors becoming the first National Park areas. In recognition of the for their conservation efforts MNPS were classified by the Wildlife Institute of India as a part of the West coast Biotic Province in 1982.

The area the MNPS covers include 148.92 km^2 of 42 islands and 309 km^2 of inter tidal zone. 162.89 km^2 is dedicated as National Park area with the remaining classified as sanctuary land. Under the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972 this means that no human intrusion is permitted in the park regions but certain rights may be permitted in sanctuaries such as fishing. Initially, the MNPS was established to protect regions with rich ecosystems but since the 1991 Coastal Zone Regulation Notification coral reefs as well as mangroves have been included in this protection.

Coral Reefs are regions of extreme biodiversity but can also be extremely fragile under certain conditions. It has been observed using satellite data that all coral reefs combined have shrunk 43% between 1975 and 1986 with an almost 100 km^2 loss. The reason for this coral damage was due to sediment covering the coral preventing sun light from entering. As a result it starved the coral of nutrients leading to death. The main cause of the mud was due to coral dredging by a nearby cement company. As a result of these findings bans were placed on coral mining near protected areas, and between 1985 and 1991 coral reefs started to increase in size. However, with the growing industry inside the Gulf of Kutch coral reefs are once again declining.

Mangroves are less protected than coral reefs as only 140 km^2 is under MNPS control out of 665.9 km^2. Between 1960 and 1980 mangroves suffered severe destruction regardless of the MNPS. This destruction is credited to mass industry building that consequently decreased the amount of freshwater available to the mangroves. As a result some mangrove species became endangered such as Rhizophora and Ceriops while at least one went extinct. While recently mangrove cover has increased it mostly attributed to districts Jamnagar and Kutch.

==== Tourism ====
With the introduction of MNPS parts of the environment have been restored promoting tourism around and on the islands. This has also resulted in policy change around these areas. Pirotan island in 1994 was planned to be classified under the maximum protection level wherein only scientific research and environmental assistants could enter. This was formulated as a part of the 1994 management plan. However, with a growing number of tourists each year the plan was never implemented and between 2006 and 2007 seven thousand tourists entered the island. Both tourism and educational programs are managed by the Gujarat Ecological Education Research Foundation (GEER).

== Vessel Traffic Service ==
In 2012, the vessel traffic service (VTS-GOK) was opened in the Gulf of Kutch. The project was the join initiative of the Kandla Port Trust, Gujarat Maritime Board and the Directorate General of Lighthouses And Lightships of India. It is one of the largest VTS system in the world covering water area of . It extends from Koteshwar to Okha, about 800 km. It cost . It has nine radars, three repeater stations and six port monitoring stations. Two additional monitoring stations of the Indian Coast Guard at Jakhau and Okha and one station of Indian Navy at Okha is also integrated in the system. The master control centre is located in Kandla.

<text>Tony Silipo (August 10, 1957 – March 10, 2012) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1999 representing the New Democratic Party in the downtown Toronto riding of Dovercourt. In 1999 he was appointed to the Workplace Safety and Insurance appeals tribunal. He died in 2012 from a brain cancer.

==Background==
Silipo attended Bloor Collegiate Institute in Toronto, and was educated at the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall at York University, and began practising law in 1984. He also served as a trustee on the Toronto Board of Education from 1978 to 1990, and was its chair from 1989 to 1990.

==Politics==
Silipo was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1990 provincial election as the New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Toronto riding of Dovercourt. He joined the Bob Rae cabinet as Chair of the Management Board from July 31, 1991 to September 23, 1992, Minister of Education from October 15, 1991 to February 3, 1993 and Minister of Community and Social Services from February 3, 1993 to June 26, 1995.

As Education Minister, one of Silipo&#x27;s first decisions was to restore national indicator achievement tests, which had previously been removed by his predecessor, Marion Boyd. He was also an active promoter of &quot;de-streaming&quot; in an effort to stop the practice of &quot;streaming&quot; children of immigrant and working-class families into non-academic courses of study.

Although Silipo supported the Rae government&#x27;s austerity Social Contract legislation in 1993, he was generally regarded as one of the more left-leaning figures in the cabinet. In 1991, he was the only member of Rae&#x27;s inner cabinet to recommend that the government introduce public automobile insurance to the province. In 1994, he spoke in cabinet against cuts to social assistance and the introduction of user fees for certain prescription drugs.

Silipo retained his seat in the 1995 election that defeated the Rae government. He ran for the leadership of the NDP in 1996, but was unable to build a strong support base and finished fourth behind Howard Hampton, Frances Lankin and Peter Kormos. Following the contest, Silipo was appointed deputy leader of the party.

In 1997, when the provincial government was passing a bill that would amalgamate the city of Toronto with surrounding municipalities, the NDP attempted to block the bill by filibuster. Silipo introduced a list of 11,000 amendments, to be debated and voted on one at a time (many of the specific amendments were read by other party members), which held up the bill for a week and a half.

In 1999, a reduction in ridings in Ontario resulted in the elimination of the Dovercourt riding. Silipo contested the new riding of Davenport in the 1999 election against Liberal Tony Ruprecht. He lost by nearly 5,000 votes.

===Cabinet positions===

==Later life==
He was appointed to the Workplace Safety and Insurance appeals tribunal by Labour Minister Chris Stockwell in 1999. In 2003, he became president of the newly formed Federation of Calabrese in Ontario. He died in 2012 after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. He was 54.

<doc id="1059025" wikidata="Q6839102" url="?curid=1059025" title="MicroDry">
<text>MicroDry is a computer printing system developed by the ALPS corporation of Japan. It is a wax/resin-transfer system using individual colored thermal ribbon cartridges, and can print in process color using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black cartridges, as well as spot-color cartridges as white, metallic silver, and metallic gold, on a wide variety of paper and transparency stock. Certain MicroDry printers can also operate in dye sublimation mode, using special cartridges and paper. ALPS licensed the technology to Citizen (Printiva series) and to Okidata (Oki DP series). Alps also produced the actual printer hardware and ink ribbon cartridges for those companies.

A typical MicroDry printer includes a moving carriage containing the print head, which is capable of picking up cartridges from a rack on the front cover of the machine, printing with them, and returning them to the rack, without human intervention. Printing is normally done one color at a time, printing the entire cyan portion of the page, then retracting the page to print the entire magenta portion, then yellow, then black (or yellow, magenta, cyan, and a protective overcoat, in dye sublimation mode). When multiple spot colors are used in addition to CMYK, the printer can be manually directed to retract the page at the end of the printing cycle, instead of ejecting it, thus assuring that the spot colors remain in registration.

Because ALPS had little name recognition among United States consumers, because it could not interest other major printer manufacturers in its system, and because it is considerably slower than most ink-jet systems, the MicroDry system never achieved wide acceptance despite its ability to produce clear, waterproof, fade-resistant hardcopy. It has found a niche market in certain types of large format printers used in the signage industry, as well as an extremely loyal following among those who understand its capabilities. ALPS does continued to produce mechanisms for use in plotters, as well as supplies, and had pledged to continue doing so for as long as there is a significant demand.

However, as of March 2007, ALPS ceased support of the MicroDry technology outside Japan. MicroDry printers and consumables were still manufactured and supported for the Japanese domestic market, however, and there still are suppliers of the printers and consumables sourcing stock from Japan for sale worldwide. As of May 2010, Alps discontinued sales of their latest MicroDry printer, the MD-5500. Alps will discontinue supplying the MicroDry consumables in May 2015.

The feature yet unsurpassed on MicroDry technology is its ability to print unconventional inks; white, metallic colours and clear (matte or gloss) finish. This feature is especially sought after on modelmaking community for printing decals (which often involve white colour), and also for T-shirt customizing. Neither inkjet nor laser printers can print any other colours than CMYK, as they assume the media is always white. As such, they are not suitable for purposes other than generic home and office printing. MicroDry printers can be used on printing non-white or transparent media, which inkjets or laser printers cannot handle sufficiently well, and they can also handle a variety of media, such as plastic, cardboard or even metals. The second-hand MicroDry printers are much sought after and can be expensive (prices ranging in early 2006 from USD 300 to 700, depending on condition).

<text>Libertarian Municipal People () was originally a slate to contest municipal elections in Sweden, first proposed and staffed by libertarian socialists and syndicalists.

In late February 1950, representatives from syndicalist organizations from Gästrikland, northern Uppland, Älvdalen, as well as individuals from Stockholm, Västmanland and Härjedalen gathered to form a platform to contest municipal elections. Thus FKF emerged, formed outside of the SAC proper. The &#x27;National Organization of Libertarian Municipal People&#x27; (&quot;Frihetliga Kommunalfolkets Riksorganisation&quot;) was founded on June 28, 1950. FKF won 51 seats in 16 municipalities in the 1950 municipal elections, becoming the largest party in Älvdalen with 10 seats.

In 1959, FKF won three seats in Ekshärad municipality.

FKF won municipal representation in Ljusdal in 1976.

A text published by SAC in 1963 defined the role of FKF in the following way: &quot;Syndikalismen bildar alltså inget politiskt parti, men utanför SAC har syndikalister bildat Frihetliga Kommunalfolket som har haft relativt stora framgångar, bland annat i vissa områden i Dalarna. Den kommunala självstyrelsen har i syndikalismen en hängiven försvarare, och den frihetliga kommunalrörelsen är ett uttryck för direkt frihetlig aktion underifrån.&quot; (&quot;Thus Syndicalism does not form any political party, but outside of SAC syndicalists have formed Frihetliga Kommunalfolket which has had relative big successes, for example in some areas in Dalarna. Syndicalism is a faithful defender of the municipal self-rule, and the libertarian municipal movement is an expression of direct libertarian action from below.&quot;)

In the 1994 elections, the candidature FKF was used in two municipalities, Älvdalen and Ljusdal. FKF got 3.6% of votes in Ljusdal and 2.8% in Älvdalen.

In the 1998 elections in Älvdalen, FKF received 286 votes (6.3%) and 3 seats.

Notably, both the Älvdalen and Färila (in Ljusdal municipality) local organizations of the SAC belonged to the pragmatic fraction that broke away in end of 1990s.

In Ljusdal, Libertarian Municipal People fielded a joint candidature with &quot;Rädda Ljusdalsbygden&quot; (environmentally oriented splinter group of VPK) called &quot;Frihetliga Ljusdalsbygden&quot;. FLB contested the 2002 municipal elections and got 551 votes (5.0%) and two seats; Artur Berg from FKF and Jonny Mill from RLB. FLB has however broken down after the elections, and both groups work separately again.

FKF in Älvdalen is involved in a regional coalition Folkkampanjen för sjukvården (Peoples Campaign for Health Care).

FKF has a replacement seat in the Associations of Municipalities of Dalarna.

<text>Denny Park is a park located in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It occupies the block bounded by John Street and Denny Way on the north and south and Dexter and 9th Avenues N. on the west and east.

==History==

Denny Park is Seattle&#x27;s oldest park. In 1861 pioneer David Denny donated the land to the city as Seattle Cemetery. In 1883, the graves were removed and the cemetery was converted to a park, the city&#x27;s first. By 1904, the surrounding area had become residential, and the park was improved with formally designed planting beds, swings and other play equipment, a sand lot and a play field. The Denny School, an elementary school, stood slightly southeast of the park from 1884 to 1928. Children were, from the earliest, regular users of the park.

The park originally stood on the north slope of Denny Hill. Between 1900 and 1931, the landscape of central Seattle was reshaped by a series of regrading projects. Denny Regrade No. 1, around 1910, lowered the land to the south and west of the park by some . Some surviving Seattle pioneers successfully demanded that the park remain unchanged. The result, however, was that access to the park from the downtown side was impossible by car due to the grade. In Denny Regrade No. 2, around 1930, the park was graded flat and was once again planted in a formal style; the old Denny School was destroyed in the regrade, and its cupola was placed in the park as an historical marker.

A bust of Mark A. Matthews, a minister and activist, was installed in 1941. In 1948, over the objections of the Denny family, a Parks and Recreation building was built within the park to house this growing city department. For several years, before all of the space was required for Parks personnel, the lower level of the new building housed the Washington Society for Crippled Children. By 1964, Parks Department personnel had fully inhabited the building.

Phase 1 (Play area and lighting) opened on May 2, 2009. Future phases include a new central water feature and a history element highlighting early Seattle (to join the existing statue of Mark A. Matthews).

A coalition of park supporters called Friends of Denny Park advocates to city government for safety in the park. This group is working, in partnership with city departments, to revitalize the park to serve its users and the nearby neighborhoods South Lake Union and Denny Triangle.

In 2020, a large homeless encampment grew in Denny Park, leading some local residents to avoid the park due to concerns over personal safety. Following a park cleanup by volunteer group We Heart Seattle, the city swept the remaining residents and their belongings from the park.
