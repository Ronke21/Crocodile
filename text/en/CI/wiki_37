<text>&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It appears as the third track on the band&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, released by DGC Records in September 1993. It was one of two songs on &quot;In Utero&quot; remixed by Scott Litt prior to the album&#x27;s release, due to the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the original mixing by producer Steve Albini. The Litt remix also featured additional vocal harmonies and guitar by Cobain, which were the only elements on the album&#x27;s 12 main tracks not recorded during the original sessions with Albini in February 1993.

In Michael Azerrad&#x27;s 1993 Nirvana biography, Cobain explained that &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was written about children with terminal cancer. However, the song is generally also believed to be about his relationship with his wife, Courtney Love, of the American rock band, Hole.

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was released as &quot;In Utero&#x27;s&quot; first single on August 30, 1993. Although the single was not released in the United States, to avoid competing with album sales, the song generated considerable American radio airplay, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The physical single reached the top 10 in several countries, including Portugal, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, and New Zealand. It also reached to Top 40 in numerous other countries. 

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was the final song performed at Nirvana&#x27;s last concert, on March 1, 1994, in Munich, Germany. It was also the final Nirvana song to receive a music video before the suicide of Cobain in April 1994. The video, directed by Anton Corbijn, won two awards, including Best Alternative Video, at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. 

==Early history==

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was written by Cobain in early 1992 at the apartment in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles, California he shared with his wife, the American musician Courtney Love. In a 1994 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with David Fricke, Love recalled hearing Cobain work on the guitar riff for the first time:

The only time I asked him for a riff for one of my songs, he was in the closet. We had this huge closet, and I heard him in there working on &#x27;Heart-Shaped Box.&#x27; He did that in five minutes. Knock, knock, knock. &#x27;What?&#x27; &#x27;Do you need that riff?&#x27; &#x27;Fuck you!&#x27; Slam. &quot;[Laughs]&quot; He was trying to be so sneaky. I could hear that one from downstairs.

Cobain briefly set the song aside, then resumed work on it after he and Love moved to an apartment in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. Nirvana&#x27;s first attempts to work on it were unsuccessful; Cobain said he waited for bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl &quot;to come up with something but it just turned into noise all the time&quot;. Eventually, during one jam session, Cobain said he &quot;came up with the vocal style instantly and it just all flowed out real fast. We finally realized that it was a good song.&quot;

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was first performed live on January 16, 1993, at the Hollywood Rock Festival in São Paulo, Brazil. It was first recorded in the studio a few days later, at BMG Ariola studios in Rio de Janeiro. Producer Craig Montgomery recalled hearing the song during the band&#x27;s soundcheck in São Paulo, saying that &quot;even then Kurt knew this was the single ... All the other [new] stuff they had was way more noisy and abrasive than this. Even the other sound guys that were out there on the platform with me were going, &#x27;Yeah, this is a good song. The band&#x27;s guitar tech, Ernie Bailey, also had a positive initial reaction to the song in Brazil, saying that &quot;you could tell this was an important song, in a lot of ways. You knew that it just had a lot of weight to it, even the first time you heard it.&quot;

Two versions of the song were recorded at BMG Ariola, with the initial take being done to test the studio&#x27;s equipment. The second take was posthumously released on the band&#x27;s rarities box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, in November 2004, and on the compilation album &quot;&quot; in November 2005. On January 23, the band again performed &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; live, at the Hollywood Rock Festival in Rio de Janeiro. These early versions of the song featured unfinished lyrics and what music journalist Gillian G. Gaar called &quot;a far more experimental solo, more akin to the group&#x27;s improvs&quot;.

==&quot;In Utero&quot;==

The final studio version of &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;. Work on the song began on February 14, the second day of recording. According to Albini in a 2013 interview for the audio series &quot;Spotify Landmark&quot;, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was the only song recorded during the sessions that required &quot;more than a couple of takes&quot;, along with eventual fourth single, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;.

In a 2013 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with Fricke, Grohl recalled that &quot;everyone was concerned about the tempo of &#x27;Heart-Shaped Box.&#x27; But click tracks were not cool. Kurt and Steve came up with this idea — we should use a strobe light [laughs]. We had this long conversation about how it won&#x27;t dictate the tempo, just imply the tempo. ... I sat there for a take or two with this fucking strobe light in my face until I practically had a seizure.&quot;

Despite his overall satisfaction with the recording, Novoselic was unhappy with the original effect used during the song&#x27;s guitar solo, and recalled arguing with Cobain and Albini about it:

These were the words I said: &#x27;Why do you want to take such a beautiful song and throw this hideous abortion in the middle of it? And they&#x27;re like, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know, it sounds good.&#x27; They didn&#x27;t have any arguments, because they were sabotaging it is what they were doing.

===Remix===

The guitar effect was eventually removed when the song was remixed, along with second single &quot;All Apologies&quot;, by Scott Litt at Bad Animal Studios in Seattle in May 1993, several months before the album&#x27;s release. Cobain and Novoselic had agreed that the vocals and bass were too quiet in Albini&#x27;s original mix of the album, and elected to have the two future singles remixed. Litt&#x27;s remix of &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; also featured newly recorded vocal harmonies and acoustic guitar by Cobain.

==Later performances==

On September 25, 1993, the band performed &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, along with &quot;Rape Me&quot;, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at NBC Studios in New York City. It was their first show with second guitarist Pat Smear.

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was the final song played at Nirvana&#x27;s last show, on March 1, 1994, at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport in Munich, Germany.

==Composition==
&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of four minutes and thirty-nine seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in a 4/4 time signature, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is in the key of A minor, modulating to A dorian on the verses, while Kurt Cobain&#x27;s vocal range spans one octave, from the low note of A3 to the high note of A4.

The song has a basic sequence of A5–F5–D5–A–F5–D7 in the verses and A5–F5–D7 during the chorus as its chord progression. Journalist Gillian Gaar described &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; as &quot;the Nirvana formula personified, with a restrained, descending riff played through the verse, building in intensity to the cascading passion of the chorus&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===

In the 1993 Nirvana biography &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Cobain told author Michael Azerrad that &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was written about children with cancer. &quot;Every time I see documentaries about little kids with cancer I just freak out&quot;, he explained. &quot;It affects me on the highest emotional level, more than anything else on television.&quot; As Azerrad noted, however, the song&#x27;s lyrics were more likely about Love. Charles R. Cross, author of the 2001 Cobain biography &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;, described the lyric, &quot;I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black&quot; as &quot;what has to be the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say &#x27;I love you&#x27;&quot;. Garr wrote that &quot;while the song does reference [cancer], the lyrics appear more to address the physical and emotional dependencies inherent in relationships.&quot;

Cobain&#x27;s unused liner notes for &quot;In Utero&quot;, first described in &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot; and published in &quot;Journals&quot; the following year, featured an explanation for &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; that &quot;fell completely apart&quot;, according to Cross, &quot;but touched on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, ″&quot;I Claudius&quot;″, Leonardo da Vinci, male seahorses (who carry their young), racism in the Old West, and Camille Paglia&quot;.

The song&#x27;s title was inspired by the collection of heart-shaped candy boxes Love kept in the front room of the Fairfax apartment she and Cobain lived in. However, early versions of the song featured the word &quot;coffin&quot; rather than &quot;box&quot;. According to Bailey, the song also featured the working title &quot;New Complaint.&quot; In a 1993 interview with &quot;Circus&quot;, Cobain explained that the chorus lyrics &quot;Hey / Wait / I&#x27;ve got a new complaint&quot; were a reference to how he believed he was often perceived by the media.

In 2012, Love wrote on Twitter that &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was about her vagina. Tweeting to the American musician Lana Del Rey, who had covered the song at a concert in Sydney, Australia, the previous week, Love wrote, &quot;You do know the song is about my Vagina right? &#x27;Throw down your umbilical noose so i can climb right back,&#x27; umm ... On top of which some of the lyrics about my vagina I contributed.&quot; The tweets were deleted shortly after.

==Release==

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; was released as &quot;In Utero&#x27;s&quot; first commercial single on August 30, 1993, on CD, cassette tape, and 7-inch, and 12-inch vinyl record formats. The single was released in Europe only and peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, making it their highest-charting song there. All copies of the single featured the Grohl-composed &quot;Marigold&quot; as a B-side, while 12-inch vinyl and CD editions also included the &quot;In Utero&quot; track, &quot;Milk It&quot;.

In the United States, DGC sent promo copies of the song to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September. The label did not actively court Top 40 radio, with Geffen Records&#x27; head of marketing explaining that &quot;Nirvana didn&#x27;t sell nearly 5 million [records] because of a hit single. They sold that many albums because of who they are&quot;. DGC employee Mark Kates stated that &quot;Generally we don&#x27;t release commercial singles because we feel it cannibalises album sales&quot; with fellow employee Jim Merlis adding that &quot;European singles are released because overseas there&#x27;s a whole singles market&quot;. However, the single was available in the US in limited numbers as an import release.

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart at number seven, and eventually peaked at number one on the chart. The song also reached number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; reported in November, 1993, that the song had been well received on Italian contemporary hit radio station RTL 102.5. In Israel, it was voted in at number 27 on the IBA&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Israel&quot; singles chart.

===Critical reception===

Reviewing &quot;In Utero&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Fricke called &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; &quot;the kind of song Stone Temple Pilots couldn&#x27;t write even with detailed instructions&quot;, and cited it as evidence, along with &quot;Dumb&quot;, that if Generation X &quot;is ever going to have its own Lennon — someone who genuinely believes in rock &amp; roll salvation but doesn&#x27;t confuse mere catharsis with true deliverance — Cobain is damn near it&quot;. Phil Alexander of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote that &quot;on the current single Heart-Shaped Box, the sublime All Apologies ... and the convalescent croon of Penny Royal Tea, [Cobain] re-stakes his claim as one of his generation&#x27;s most absorbing songsmiths.&quot; John Mulvey of the &quot;NME&quot; called the song &quot;a strangulated, semi-f-ed-up anthem of sorts for a generation who fell in love to &#x27;Teen Spirit&#x27; and are now as disturbed as Kurt by a growing sense of maturity&quot;.

===Legacy===

In his review of Nirvana&#x27;s eponymous greatest hits album in 2002, Will Bryant of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ve always considered &#x27;Heart-Shaped Box&#x27;, with its elliptical guitar figure and explosive choruses, to be one of Cobain&#x27;s most accomplished compositions. For all its heavy-handed symbolism, the song strikes deepest to Cobain&#x27;s preoccupation with birth, the menstrual cycle, and female anatomy, wound tightly with primal tension in the verses and released with sublime catharsis in the choruses.&quot; Andrew Romano of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; called it &quot;as close as Cobain ever got to a perfect song&quot;, with &quot;a perfect music video to match&quot;.

In 1999, the song was voted number 10 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Rock Tracks Ever!&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked the song number one and number two, respectively, on their lists of the 20 greatest Nirvana songs. In 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; readers voted it the 30th best song of the 1990s.

===20th anniversary version===

A second &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; single was released in September 2013, to promote the 20th anniversary re-release of &quot;In Utero&quot;. The three-track promo CD single was included with the first 2000 copies of the &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition of the re-issue, and featured Albini&#x27;s original mix of the song and a remix prepared by Albini in 2013 as B-sides.

==Music video==

===Preliminary work===

The &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; video was the only music video made for &quot;In Utero&quot;, and the last video released by the band. Cobain had originally approached American filmmaker Kevin Kerslake, who had directed the band&#x27;s last four music videos, for the songs &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;In Bloom&quot;, and &quot;Sliver&quot;, to direct it. Five treatments were prepared by Kerslake between July 14 and August 12, and included scenes of Cobain kissing American author William S. Burroughs, whom Cobain had wanted in the video, and the band hanging by their necks from tree branches. However, no shoot arrangements were made, and by the end of August, the group had elected to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn instead.

Corbijn believes he was chosen to work on the video on the recommendation of Love, and cited his connection to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, a rock band from Liverpool, England where Love briefly lived and whom Love admired. According to Corbijn, Cobain had asked to be sent the music videos he had directed for Echo &amp; the Bunnymen shortly before receiving a fax from Novoselic with drawings and ideas about a Nirvana video.

As Corbijn recalled, Cobain&#x27;s proposed treatment for the video was &quot;incredibly precise. More precise than I&#x27;ve ever had for a video. I loved it, but initially I was a bit taken aback that somebody came up with so many ideas, because generally my videos are my own ideas ... But then I looked at it and I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did.&quot; According to Novoselic, Cobain&#x27;s original treatment was two pages long; Novoselic recalled typing it on his new laptop while Cobain dictated.

===Filming===

The &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; video was filmed on August 31 and September 1 at Raleigh Studios in Los Angeles. Cobain had requested the video be shot in Technicolor, but as Corbijn recalled, &quot;somehow it was not possible; maybe the whole system had been sold to China or something.&quot; Instead, Corbijn and his producer came up with the idea to shoot the video in color, then convert it to black and white and have every frame hand-tinted. The process took weeks and led to the vivid brightness of the video&#x27;s colors.

In a 2013 interview with Andrew Romano of &quot;Daily Beast&quot;, Corbijn recalled &quot;a really eerie moment&quot; where the actor playing the video&#x27;s elderly man, &quot;fell down while walking, on the set. He had some kind of bowel cancer, which he didn&#x27;t know. Something broke open. There was blood everywhere. We had to get the ambulance, and he had to go to the hospital straight off. It was really severe.&quot; According to Corbijn, the old man was the most difficult to cast because finding &quot;an old man who looked like an old man in L.A. was not so easy ... In the end we found this fantastic man who had a jazz club or a jazz station on the radio, something like that.&quot; Cobain had originally wanted Burroughs to play the role of the elderly man, but Burroughs declined, although they later met and collaborated on the spoken word piece, &quot;The &#x27;Priest&#x27; They Called Him&quot;.

According to Corbijn, the two other characters in the video, the overweight woman and the young girl, were easier to cast, &quot;although it was difficult sometimes I think for the child to act because there was blood coming out of her blouse at some point.&quot;

Corbijn remembered Cobain as &quot;very alert. Smart boy. Very intelligent. He did everything I asked him to do.&quot; According to Cali DeWitt, who briefly worked as the Cobains&#x27; nanny, Cobain and Love had fought on set, with Cobain putting out a cigarette on his forehead in retaliation to Love&#x27;s repeated reminders that this was an &quot;important video&quot; and that he needed to &quot;look good&quot;. As DeWitt told author Everett True, &quot;if you watch the video, there&#x27;s a lot of make-up on his forehead because it was a really bad scab, big and in the center. In the close-ups, there&#x27;s a strip of hair that never seems to move from the middle of his forehead. They had to paste some hair over it.&quot;

===Synopsis===

The &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; video begins and ends with the band watching the elderly man on a hospital bed being administered medication through an IV drip. Most of the video takes place in what Garr called &quot;a surreal &#x27;outdoor&#x27; setting; a field of bright red poppies with a large cross standing in the middle, adjacent to a wood of creepy old trees (both elements in key scenes in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;).&quot; During the song&#x27;s first verse, the elderly man, wearing a Santa Claus hat and loincloth, climbs onto the cross, which is covered by crows. The second verse introduces the young girl in what appears to be a Ku Klux Klan robe and peaked hat reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and the overweight woman in a human organ body suit with angel wings affixed to her back, similar to the winged anatomical model on the cover of &quot;In Utero&quot;. At one point during the second verse, the girl attempts to chase the three crows from the cross while the old man, now wearing a mitre, is tied to it.

During the song&#x27;s guitar solo, the girl&#x27;s hat is blown off her head and falls into a puddle in the poppy field, where it turns black. A brief shot during the solo reveals a fetus in the IV drip. The third verse features Cobain singing directly into the camera without his guitar, while Grohl and Novoselic stand behind him in a room with stars on the walls. The room is actually a box designed by Corbjin with a large heart on top, but the band initially disapproved of the way it looked, and Novoselic asked that it not be filmed from a distance. A brief shot of the box, with the heart above, appears at the start of the final chorus.

The band is featured performing with their instruments during the first two choruses, and without their instruments in what appears to be the same star-decorated box, zoomed out to reveal a bed, nightstand with a lamp on it, and rocking chair, during the final chorus. Both the sky and the walls of the box are blue during the quieter verses, and red during their heavier choruses and the solo. During the video Cobain repeatedly charges the camera, and his face moves in and out of focus.

As Garr pointed out, the Ku Klux Klan imagery recalled Cobain&#x27;s original idea for the &quot;In Bloom&quot; video, which was to feature a young girl born into the KKK who eventually rejects her parents as &quot;evil&quot;.

In his interview with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Corbjin estimated that he came up with &quot;maybe 15 percent&quot; of the video&#x27;s ideas, with the rest being Cobain&#x27;s. &quot;The big woman, for instance, was my idea&quot;, he explained. &quot;For me that was Mother Earth. There were a few other things, like the mechanical birds and the fake butterflies and stuff.&quot; Corbjin also said the idea to have a crow lip sync parts of the first chorus was his, calling it an example of his &quot;Dutch humor&quot;. According to Garr, Cobain had originally wanted to use real animals. Corbijn also added the ladder that the elderly man used to climb up the cross, the box that the band performed in, and the road through the poppy field.

===&quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;===

While editing the video, Corbijn was visited by Cobain and Love, and urged by the latter to use the extended shot of Cobain singing the third verse. As Corbijn later explained, &quot;Kurt looked amazing, and Courtney wanted to keep that shot till the very end. It was a very long take, but she persuaded Kurt to go with that.&quot; However, Corbjin then edited a different version which replaced this shot with additional footage of the young girl and woman, as well as scenes of Cobain lying in the poppy field, covered in mist.

According to Corbijn, &quot;They used Courtney&#x27;s edit initially, and then they put mine out as well. And my edit became the video in the end.&quot; This version also appeared on the DVD &quot;The Work of Director Anton Corbijn&quot; in 2005. Both the &quot;Original&quot; and &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; versions of the video appeared as bonus footage in 2013 on the &quot;Live and Loud&quot; DVD, which was issued as a standalone release as well as part of the 20th anniversary &quot;In Utero&quot; &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; package.

===Lawsuit===

On March 9, 1994, Kerslake sued Nirvana over the &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; video, alleging copyright infringement. According to &quot;Nirvana: A Day by Day Eyewitness Chronicle&quot; by Carrie Borzillo, Kerslake discovered that he would no longer be directing the video on August 28, 1993, and sent a letter to Corbjin to ensure that none of the images in his five treatments would appear in the final video. Kerslake&#x27;s lawsuit stated that both Cobain and Nirvana&#x27;s record company had approved Kerslake&#x27;s third treatment for the video, with Cobain describing it as &quot;Perfect&quot;.

On September 1, 1993, Cobain called Kerslake and invited him to the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards the following day, where Kerslake&#x27;s video for &quot;In Bloom&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Video. Kerslake accepted the invitation, and joined the band onstage after they won the award. Soon after Kerslake wrote Cobain a letter, addressed to &quot;kurdt&quot;, thanking him for the invitation but expressing his unhappiness over reports that his alleged ideas had been used in Corbijn&#x27;s shoot. Cobain did not respond, but a meeting was set up between attorneys and the record label to discuss the video.

The case did not affect the video&#x27;s distribution, and was ultimately settled out of court. In 2019, Cobain&#x27;s former manager Danny Goldberg discussed the lawsuit in his Cobain biography &quot;Serving the Servant&quot;, writing that &quot;after the video was aired, Kerslake sued Kurt, claiming, absurdly in my opinion, that he was responsible for the idea of &#x27;Heart Shaped Box.&#x27; Kurt was deeply offended. After he died the remaining members of Nirvana settled with Kerslake.&quot;

===Reception===

The &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; music video was the number one most played music video for four weeks on MTV in the US as recorded by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. It was also number one on Canada&#x27;s &quot;MuchMusic Countdown&quot; for two weeks in November 1993. The video won two MTV Video Music Awards in 1994, for Best Alternative Video and for Best Art Direction. Since the ceremony was held after Cobain&#x27;s suicide in April 1994, the awards were accepted by surviving bandmembers Grohl, Novoselic and Smear. &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; also topped the music video category in the 1993 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. The video was also placed into active rotation on MTV Europe and power play on The Box in the UK and Ireland. It was also played on &quot;Rage&quot; in Australia.

Cobain was pleased with the video, saying that it came &quot;closer to what I&#x27;ve seen in my mind, to what I&#x27;ve envisioned, than any other video.&quot; Novoselic agreed that &quot;Anton did a beautiful job on that video.&quot; Cobain later asked Corbijn to direct a video for &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, but Corbijn refused, saying that he felt &quot;the &#x27;Heart-Shaped Box&#x27; video was so good, I could never make a video that was as good or better.&quot; According to Corbijn, Cobain responded by telling him he would &quot;never make another video if you don&#x27;t do it. And he didn&#x27;t.&quot;

===Legacy===

In 2011, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song&#x27;s music video at number 22 on its of the &quot;100 Greatest Music Videos&quot;. That same year, &quot;Time&quot; magazine placed &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; on its list of &quot;The 30 All-Time Best Music Videos&quot;, where it was described as &quot;beautiful and ... terrible&quot;.

In February 2016, Grohl reunited with actress Kelsey Rohr, who played the girl in the &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; music video 23 years earlier, at the age of six. Rohr stated that &quot;Today reminded me that I peaked at 6 years old but I was the most badass kid on the playground. Today was the absolute coolest. Or in Dave&#x27;s words seeing each other today was a &#x27;historic moment&#x27;! What a legend!&quot;

In 2024, the song was featured in the ending of the Season 4 finale of &quot;The Boys&quot;.

<text>Burbage is a village and civil parish in the Vale of Pewsey, Wiltshire, England. It is about south of Marlborough and west of Newbury.

The parish includes the hamlets of Durley, Eastcourt, Marr Green, Ram Alley, Stibb Green, The Warren (which is close to Tottenham House), and Westcourt.

==Local government==
Burbage is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority. Both councils are responsible for different aspects of local government.

==Geography==
Burbage stands on a watershed at the eastern end of the Vale of Pewsey, with streams to the east draining to the Thames via the Dun and Kennet; to the south draining to the Salisbury Avon via the River Bourne; and to the north and west direct to the Avon.

The village High Street was the main north–south road from Marlborough to Andover, now the A346 primary route, until a bypass was built to the west in 1991. A more minor route from Pewsey to Hungerford and the M4 (designated A338 to the east and B3087 to the west) passes to the south of the village. Burbage no longer has a station on the nearby Reading to Taunton line, the nearest stations being at Great Bedwyn (which has commuter services to London) and .

Burbage lies in the heart of the North Wessex Downs, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
The 1086 Domesday survey recorded a church, four landholders and 15 households, and a further eight households at the settlement later known as Wulfhall or Wolfhall, about three-quarters of a mile to the east. In the 16th century, Wulfhall was the seat of the Seymour family; among them Jane Seymour, who was queen to Henry VIII. The Seymour manor house was demolished in 1723 and replaced by a larger house nearby. Wulfhall was anciently a tithing of Great Bedwyn parish and was transferred to Burbage parish in the late 19th century.

The Kennet and Avon Canal, completed in 1810, crosses the parish just north of the village, where it passes through the Bruce Tunnel. Burbage Wharf was further west, where the canal passes under the present-day A346.

The Great Western Railway&#x27;s Berks and Hants Extension Railway from to was built close to the canal in the 1860s, eventually becoming part of the to section of the main line from in 1906. The GWR built north of the village, above the canal tunnel; British Railways closed it in 1966 but the line remains in use. Until 1947 there was also a goods-only station at Burbage Wharf.

The Midland and South Western Junction Railway opened from to in 1882, the latter station being situated in nearby West Grafton. The northern section of the M&amp;SWJR line from Swindon to had opened in 1881, and this was joined to the southern section from 1883 by using the Great Western Railway&#x27;s branch between Savernake and . In 1898 the M&amp;SWJR got its own route between Marlborough and Grafton and a new station opened at . The M&amp;SWJR had therefore become a route between and Cheltenham and the Midlands. British Railways closed it in 1961.

The population of Burbage peaked at around 1600 with the building of the railway in 1860, declining to a low point of 1000 a century later. It has since increased steadily, regaining its 1860s level in the 21st century.

The first school in the village was built at Eastcourt in 1806, rebuilt in 1856 and supplemented by a separate building for younger children in 1861. This school was taken over by the county council around 1906, and educated children of all ages until Marlborough secondary school opened in 1946. The 19th-century buildings (designated Grade II listed in 1988) were closed in 1989 upon the opening of the new school, and became a private residence.

== Church and chapel ==
The Church of England parish church of All Saints was rebuilt in 1854 by T.H. Wyatt, then extended with a south aisle in 1876. The original church was from the 12th century and was rebuilt in the 14th and 15th, when the tower was added; the porch was added in the 16th. The present church retains only the tower and porch of the earlier building, and is Grade II* listed. The church is now part of the Savernake team ministry.

A small Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built at Eastcourt in 1822, and replaced by a larger building on the High Street in 1906. This closed in 1996 and is now a private house.

== Amenities ==
Burbage Primary School serves the village and surrounding area. The school was built in 1989 on a centrally-located site, between the High Street and Eastcourt.

Burbage has a village hall and a cricket club, Burbage and Easton Royal CC, who play in the Wiltshire division of the West of England Premier League.

There is one pub: the &quot;White Hart&quot;, on the High Street in the centre of the village.

<doc id="1055864" wikidata="Q317027" url="?curid=1055864" title="Federal Chancellery of Germany">
<text>The Federal Chancellery (, ) is a German federal agency serving the executive office of the chancellor of Germany, the head of the federal government, currently Olaf Scholz. The Chancellery&#x27;s primary function is to assist the chancellor in coordinating the activities of the federal government. The head of the Chancellery () holds the rank of either a Secretary of State () or a Federal Minister (), currently held by Wolfgang Schmidt. The headquarters of the German Chancellery is at the Federal Chancellery building in Berlin, which is the largest government headquarters in the world.

== History ==
When the North German Confederation was created in 1867, the constitution mentioned only the &quot;Bundeskanzler&quot; as the responsible executive officer. There was no collegial government with ministers. Federal Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in the beginning only established a &quot;Bundeskanzleramt&quot; as his office. It was the only &#x27;ministry&#x27; of the country until in early 1870 the Prussian foreign office became the North German foreign office. At that occasion, the Bundeskanzleramt lost some tasks to the foreign office.

===Reichskanzleramt===
When the North German Confederation became the German Empire in 1871, the Bundeskanzleramt was renamed to &quot;Reichskanzleramt&quot;. It originally had its seat in the Radziwiłł Palace (also known as &quot;Reichskanzlerpalais&quot;), originally built by Prince Antoni Radziwiłł on Wilhelmstraße 77 in Berlin. More and more imperial offices were separated from the Reichskanzleramt, e.g. the &quot;Reichsjustizamt&quot; (Office for National Justice) in 1877. What remained of the Reichskanzleramt became in 1879 the &quot;Reichsamt des Innern&quot; (the home office).

===Reichskanzlei===
In 1878 Imperial Chancellor Bismarck created a new office for the chancellor&#x27;s affairs, the &quot;Reichskanzlei&quot;. It kept its name over the years, also in the republic since 1919. In 1938–39, the building &quot;Neue Reichskanzlei&quot; (New Imperial Chancellery), designed by Albert Speer, was built; its main entrance was located at Voßstraße 6, while the building occupied the entire northern side of the street. It was damaged during World War II and later demolished by Soviet occupation forces.

===Bundeskanzleramt===
In 1949, the Federal Republic was created. Bonn was made the provisional capital. Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer used the Museum Koenig for the first two months and then moved the &quot;Bundeskanzleramt&quot; into &quot;Palais Schaumburg&quot; until a new Chancellery building was completed in 1976. The new &quot;West German Chancellery building&quot; was a black structure completed in the International Style, in an unassuming example of modernism.

In 1999, the headquarters of the Federal Chancellery were moved from Bonn to Berlin under the Berlin-Bonn Act, first into the Staatsratsgebäude, then in 2001 to the new building on the Spreebogen; since 2001 the secondary seat of the Federal Chancellery has been the Palais Schaumburg. A separate building, the &quot;Kanzlerbungalow&quot; served as private residence of the Chancellor and his family 1964–1999.

==Headquarters==

&quot;Bundeskanzleramt&quot; is also the name of the building in Berlin that houses the personal offices of the chancellor and the Chancellery staff. Palais Schaumburg in Bonn is the secondary official seat of the German Federal Chancellery.

Opened in the spring of 2001, the current Chancellery building was designed by Charlotte Frank and Axel Schultes and was built by a joint venture of Royal BAM Group&#x27;s subsidiary Wayss &amp; Freytag and the Spanish Acciona Occupying 12,000 square meters (129,166 square feet), it is also the largest government headquarters building in the world. By comparison, the new Chancellery building is ten times the size of the White House.

Because of its distinctive but controversial architecture, journalists, tourist guides and some locals refer to the buildings as &quot;Kohllosseum&quot; (as a mix of Colosseum and former chancellor Helmut Kohl under whom it was built), &quot;Bundeswaschmaschine&quot; (federal laundry machine, because of the round-shaped windows and its cubic form), or &quot;Elefantenklo&quot; (elephant loo).

Access for the general public is only possible on particular days during the year. Since 1999, the German government has welcomed the general public for one weekend per year to visit its buildings – usually in August.

== Heads of the Chancellery ==
Heads of the German Chancellery (&quot;Chef des Bundeskanzleramts&quot;, ChefBK) attend Cabinet meetings. They may also sit as members of the Cabinet if they are also given the position of Minister for Special Affairs (&quot;Minister für besondere Aufgaben&quot;). They are often called &quot;Kanzleramtsminister&quot; (&quot;chancellery minister&quot;). Otherwise, they have the rank of a secretary of state (comparable to a minor or vice minister in other countries).

The current Head of the Chancellery is Wolfgang Schmidt.

Typically a ChefBK is a very close advisor of the chancellor, being the primary contact to the cabinet ministers. Many of them became cabinet ministers (with other portfolios) themselves, several ministers of the interior. Frank Walter Steinmeier who served as minister of the chancery under Schröder (1999–2005) later served as minister of foreign affairs (2005–2009 and 2013–2017) candidate for chancellor (2009) leader of the opposition (2009-2013) and ultimately in the largely ceremonial role of federal president (2017–).

<text>Royal Air Force Ballyhalbert or more simply RAF Ballyhalbert is a former Royal Air Force sector station at Ballyhalbert on the Ards Peninsula, County Down, Northern Ireland.

RAF Kirkistown was a satellite to the larger Ballyhalbert.

Construction began in 1940.

== History ==

=== Royal Air Force use ===
It opened provisionally in May 1941, prior to completion of the works, as a RAF Fighter Command base where the primary weapon was the Supermarine Spitfire, and officially on 28 June of that same year. The base provided local protection from Luftwaffe raids on Belfast and the rest of the province. Other aircraft operated from the base were the Hawker Hurricane, Bristol Beaufighter, North American Mustang and Boulton Paul Defiant night fighter. During its lifetime, Ballyhalbert was home to RAF, Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), British Army, Royal Navy and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) personnel. Servicemen from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Poland also saw duty at Ballyhalbert.

=== Fleet Air Arm use ===

In 1942, a request for lodger facilities and a Royal Naval Air Section at RAF Ballyhalbert was granted by RAF Northern Ireland. On 14 July 1945 the airbase was transferred by RAF Northern Ireland on loan to the Admiralty and known as Royal Naval Air Station Ballyhalbert (RNAS Ballyhalbert). On 17 July it was commissioned as HMS &quot;Corncrake&quot; with Captain G.N.P. Stringer as commanding officer.

As HMS &quot;Corncrake&quot; the airfield was used by the Fleet Air Arm for squadrons working up for carrier duty. On 13 November 1945 the airfield was closed and placed on Care and Maintenance. By 1947, with no further use made of the site it was abandoned. The airfield was sold to developers in March 1960, and is in use for several popular caravan parks.

<text>Energy is sustainable if it &quot;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; Definitions of sustainable energy usually look at its effects on the environment, the economy, and society. These impacts range from greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to energy poverty and toxic waste. Renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, solar, and geothermal energy can cause environmental damage but are generally far more sustainable than fossil fuel sources.

The role of non-renewable energy sources in sustainable energy is controversial. Nuclear power does not produce carbon pollution or air pollution, but has drawbacks that include radioactive waste, the risk of nuclear proliferation, and the risk of accidents. Switching from coal to natural gas has environmental benefits, including a lower climate impact, but may lead to a delay in switching to more sustainable options. Carbon capture and storage can be built into power plants to remove their carbon dioxide () emissions, but this technology is expensive and has rarely been implemented.

Fossil fuels provide 85% of the world&#x27;s energy consumption, and the energy system is responsible for 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Around 790 million people in developing countries lack access to electricity, and 2.6 billion rely on polluting fuels such as wood or charcoal to cook. Cooking with biomass plus fossil fuel pollution causes an estimated 7 million deaths each year. Limiting global warming to will require transforming energy production, distribution, storage, and consumption. Universal access to clean electricity can have major benefits to the climate, human health, and the economies of developing countries. 

Climate change mitigation pathways have been proposed to limit global warming to . These include phasing out coal-fired power plants, conserving energy, producing more electricity from clean sources such as wind and solar, and switching from fossil fuels to electricity for transport and heating buildings. Power output from some renewable energy sources varies depending on when the wind blows and the sun shines. Switching to renewable energy can therefore require electrical grid upgrades, such as the addition of energy storage. Some processes that are difficult to electrify can use hydrogen fuel produced from low-emission energy sources. In the International Energy Agency&#x27;s proposal for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, about 35% of the reduction in emissions depends on technologies that are still in development as of 2023. 

Wind and solar market share grew to 8.5% of worldwide electricity in 2019, and costs continue to fall. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that 2.5% of world gross domestic product (GDP) would need to be invested in the energy system each year between 2016 and 2035 to limit global warming to . Governments can fund the research, development, and demonstration of new clean energy technologies. They can also build infrastructure for electrification and sustainable transport. Finally, governments can encourage clean energy deployment with policies such as carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards, and phase-outs of fossil fuel subsidies. These policies may also increase energy security.

==Definitions and background==
=== Definitions ===
The United Nations Brundtland Commission described the concept of sustainable development, for which energy is a key component, in its 1987 report &quot;Our Common Future&quot;. It defined sustainable development as meeting &quot;the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot;. This description of sustainable development has since been referenced in many definitions and explanations of sustainable energy. 

There is no universally accepted interpretation of how the concept of sustainability applies to energy on a global scale. Working definitions of sustainable energy encompass multiple dimensions of sustainability such as environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Historically, the concept of sustainable energy development has focused on emissions and on energy security. Since the early 1990s, the concept has broadened to encompass wider social and economic issues. 

The environmental dimension of sustainability includes greenhouse gas emissions, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, hazardous waste and toxic emissions, water consumption, and depletion of non-renewable resources. Energy sources with low environmental impact are sometimes called &quot;green energy&quot; or &quot;clean energy&quot;. The economic dimension of sustainability covers economic development, efficient use of energy, and energy security to ensure that each country has constant access to sufficient energy. Social issues include access to affordable and reliable energy for all people, workers&#x27; rights, and land rights.

===Environmental impacts===

The current energy system contributes to many environmental problems, including climate change, air pollution, biodiversity loss, the release of toxins into the environment, and water scarcity. As of 2019, 85% of the world&#x27;s energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels. Energy production and consumption are responsible for 76% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2018. The 2015 international Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit global warming to well below and preferably to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F); achieving this goal will require that emissions be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century.

The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major source of air pollution, which causes an estimated 7 million deaths each year, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries. Fossil-fuel burning in power plants, vehicles, and factories is the main source of emissions that combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to cause acid rain. Air pollution is the second-leading cause of death from non-infectious disease. An estimated 99% of the world&#x27;s population lives with levels of air pollution that exceed the World Health Organization recommended limits. 

Cooking with polluting fuels such as wood, animal dung, coal, or kerosene is responsible for nearly all indoor air pollution, which causes an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million deaths annually, and also contributes significantly to outdoor air pollution. Health effects are concentrated among women, who are likely to be responsible for cooking, and young children.

Environmental impacts extend beyond the by-products of combustion. Oil spills at sea harm marine life and may cause fires which release toxic emissions. Around 10% of global water use goes to energy production, mainly for cooling in thermal energy plants. In dry regions, this contributes to water scarcity. Bioenergy production, coal mining and processing, and oil extraction also require large amounts of water. Excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material for burning can cause serious local environmental damage, including desertification.

=== Sustainable development goals ===
Meeting existing and future energy demands in a sustainable way is a critical challenge for the global goal of limiting climate change while maintaining economic growth and enabling living standards to rise. Reliable and affordable energy, particularly electricity, is essential for health care, education, and economic development. As of 2020, 790 million people in developing countries do not have access to electricity, and around 2.6 billion rely on burning polluting fuels for cooking.

Improving energy access in the least-developed countries and making energy cleaner are key to achieving most of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, which cover issues ranging from climate action to gender equality. Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for &quot;access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all&quot;, including universal access to electricity and to clean cooking facilities by 2030.

==Energy conservation==
Energy efficiency—using less energy to deliver the same goods or services, or delivering comparable services with less goods—is a cornerstone of many sustainable energy strategies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that increasing energy efficiency could achieve 40% of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfil the Paris Agreement&#x27;s goals. 

Energy can be conserved by increasing the technical efficiency of appliances, vehicles, industrial processes, and buildings. Another approach is to use fewer materials whose production requires a lot of energy, for example through better building design and recycling. Behavioural changes such as using videoconferencing rather than business flights, or making urban trips by cycling, walking or public transport rather than by car, are another way to conserve energy. Government policies to improve efficiency can include building codes, performance standards, carbon pricing, and the development of energy-efficient infrastructure to encourage changes in transport modes.

The energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product (GDP)) is a rough indicator of the energy efficiency of economic production. In 2010, global energy intensity was 5.6 megajoules (1.6 kWh) per US dollar of GDP. United Nations goals call for energy intensity to decrease by 2.6% each year between 2010 and 2030. In recent years this target has not been met. For instance, between 2017 and 2018, energy intensity decreased by only 1.1%. 

Efficiency improvements often lead to a rebound effect in which consumers use the money they save to buy more energy-intensive goods and services. For example, recent technical efficiency improvements in transport and buildings have been largely offset by trends in consumer behaviour, such as selecting larger vehicles and homes.

==Sustainable energy sources==
===Renewable energy sources===

Renewable energy sources are essential to sustainable energy, as they generally strengthen energy security and emit far fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Renewable energy projects sometimes raise significant sustainability concerns, such as risks to biodiversity when areas of high ecological value are converted to bioenergy production or wind or solar farms.

Hydropower is the largest source of renewable electricity while solar and wind energy are growing rapidly. Photovoltaic solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new power generation capacity in most countries. For more than half of the 770 million people who currently lack access to electricity, decentralised renewable energy such as solar-powered mini-grids is likely the cheapest method of providing it by 2030. United Nations targets for 2030 include substantially increasing the proportion of renewable energy in the world&#x27;s energy supply. 

According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are now a commonplace source of electricity, making up 70% of all new investments made in the world&#x27;s power generation. The Agency expects renewables to become the primary energy source for electricity generation globally in the next three years, overtaking coal.

====Solar====
The Sun is Earth&#x27;s primary source of energy, a clean and abundantly available resource in many regions. In 2019, solar power provided around 3% of global electricity, mostly through solar panels based on photovoltaic cells (PV). Solar PV is expected to be the electricity source with the largest installed capacity worldwide by 2027. The panels are mounted on top of buildings or installed in utility-scale solar parks. Costs of solar photovoltaic cells have dropped rapidly, driving strong growth in worldwide capacity. The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places, cheaper than electricity from existing coal plants. Various projections of future energy use identify solar PV as one of the main sources of energy generation in a sustainable mix.

Most components of solar panels can be easily recycled, but this is not always done in the absence of regulation. Panels typically contain heavy metals, so they pose environmental risks if put in landfills. It takes fewer than two years for a solar panel to produce as much energy as was used for its production. Less energy is needed if materials are recycled rather than mined.

In concentrated solar power, solar rays are concentrated by a field of mirrors, heating a fluid. Electricity is produced from the resulting steam with a heat engine. Concentrated solar power can support dispatchable power generation, as some of the heat is typically stored to enable electricity to be generated when needed. In addition to electricity production, solar energy is used more directly; solar thermal heating systems are used for hot water production, heating buildings, drying, and desalination.

====Wind power====
Wind has been an important driver of development over millennia, providing mechanical energy for industrial processes, water pumps, and sailing ships. Modern wind turbines are used to generate electricity and provided approximately 6% of global electricity in 2019. Electricity from onshore wind farms is often cheaper than existing coal plants and competitive with natural gas and nuclear. Wind turbines can also be placed offshore, where winds are steadier and stronger than on land but construction and maintenance costs are higher. 

Onshore wind farms, often built in wild or rural areas, have a visual impact on the landscape. While collisions with wind turbines kill both bats and to a lesser extent birds, these impacts are lower than from other infrastructure such as windows and transmission lines. The noise and flickering light created by the turbines can cause annoyance and constrain construction near densely populated areas. Wind power, in contrast to nuclear and fossil fuel plants, does not consume water. Little energy is needed for wind turbine construction compared to the energy produced by the wind power plant itself. Turbine blades are not fully recyclable, and research into methods of manufacturing easier-to-recycle blades is ongoing.

====Hydropower====
Hydroelectric plants convert the energy of moving water into electricity. In 2020, hydropower supplied 17% of the world&#x27;s electricity, down from a high of nearly 20% in the mid-to-late 20th century. 

In conventional hydropower, a reservoir is created behind a dam. Conventional hydropower plants provide a highly flexible, dispatchable electricity supply. They can be combined with wind and solar power to meet peaks in demand and to compensate when wind and sun are less available.

Compared to reservoir-based facilities, run-of-the-river hydroelectricity generally has less environmental impact. However, its ability to generate power depends on river flow, which can vary with daily and seasonal weather. Reservoirs provide water quantity controls that are used for flood control and flexible electricity output while also providing security during drought for drinking water supply and irrigation.

Hydropower ranks among the energy sources with the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, but levels of emissions vary enormously between projects. The highest emissions tend to occur with large dams in tropical regions. These emissions are produced when the biological matter that becomes submerged in the reservoir&#x27;s flooding decomposes and releases carbon dioxide and methane. Deforestation and climate change can reduce energy generation from hydroelectric dams. Depending on location, large dams can displace residents and cause significant local environmental damage; potential dam failure could place the surrounding population at risk.

====Geothermal====
Geothermal energy is produced by tapping into deep underground heat and harnessing it to generate electricity or to heat water and buildings. The use of geothermal energy is concentrated in regions where heat extraction is economical: a combination is needed of high temperatures, heat flow, and permeability (the ability of the rock to allow fluids to pass through). Power is produced from the steam created in underground reservoirs. Geothermal energy provided less than 1% of global energy consumption in 2020.

Geothermal energy is a renewable resource because thermal energy is constantly replenished from neighbouring hotter regions and the radioactive decay of naturally occurring isotopes. On average, the greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal-based electricity are less than 5% that of coal-based electricity. Geothermal energy carries a risk of inducing earthquakes, needs effective protection to avoid water pollution, and releases toxic emissions which can be captured.

====Bioenergy====


Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. It can either be burned to produce heat and electricity or be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, which can be used to power vehicles. 

The climate impact of bioenergy varies considerably depending on where biomass feedstocks come from and how they are grown. For example, burning wood for energy releases carbon dioxide; those emissions can be significantly offset if the trees that were harvested are replaced by new trees in a well-managed forest, as the new trees will absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. However, the establishment and cultivation of bioenergy crops can displace natural ecosystems, degrade soils, and consume water resources and synthetic fertilisers. 

Approximately one-third of all wood used for traditional heating and cooking in tropical areas is harvested unsustainably. Bioenergy feedstocks typically require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport; the energy usage for these processes may emit greenhouse gases. In some cases, the impacts of land-use change, cultivation, and processing can result in higher overall carbon emissions for bioenergy compared to using fossil fuels. 

Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in less land being available for growing food. In the United States, around 10% of motor gasoline has been replaced by corn-based ethanol, which requires a significant proportion of the harvest. In Malaysia and Indonesia, clearing forests to produce palm oil for biodiesel has led to serious social and environmental effects, as these forests are critical carbon sinks and habitats for diverse species. Since photosynthesis captures only a small fraction of the energy in sunlight, producing a given amount of bioenergy requires a large amount of land compared to other renewable energy sources.

Second-generation biofuels which are produced from non-food plants or waste reduce competition with food production, but may have other negative effects including trade-offs with conservation areas and local air pollution. Relatively sustainable sources of biomass include algae, waste, and crops grown on soil unsuitable for food production. 

Carbon capture and storage technology can be used to capture emissions from bioenergy power plants. This process is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and can result in net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. However, BECCS can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown, harvested, and transported. Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would require converting large amounts of cropland.

====Marine energy====

Marine energy has the smallest share of the energy market. It includes OTEC, tidal power, which is approaching maturity, and wave power, which is earlier in its development. Two tidal barrage systems in France and in South Korea make up 90% of global production. While single marine energy devices pose little risk to the environment, the impacts of larger devices are less well known.

===Non-renewable energy sources===
====Fossil fuel switching and mitigation==== 
Switching from coal to natural gas has advantages in terms of sustainability. For a given unit of energy produced, the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas are around 40 times the emissions of wind or nuclear energy but are much less than coal. Burning natural gas produces around half the emissions of coal when used to generate electricity and around two-thirds the emissions of coal when used to produce heat. Natural gas combustion also produces less air pollution than coal. However, natural gas is a potent greenhouse gas in itself, and leaks during extraction and transportation can negate the advantages of switching away from coal. The technology to curb methane leaks is widely available but it is not always used. 

Switching from coal to natural gas reduces emissions in the short term and thus contributes to climate change mitigation. However, in the long term it does not provide a path to net-zero emissions. Developing natural gas infrastructure risks carbon lock-in and stranded assets, where new fossil infrastructure either commits to decades of carbon emissions, or has to be written off before it makes a profit.

The greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel and biomass power plants can be significantly reduced through carbon capture and storage (CCS). Most studies use a working assumption that CCS can capture 85–90% of the carbon dioxide () emissions from a power plant. Even if 90% of emitted is captured from a coal-fired power plant, its uncaptured emissions are still many times greater than the emissions of nuclear, solar or wind energy per unit of electricity produced. 

Since coal plants using CCS are less efficient, they require more coal and thus increase the pollution associated with mining and transporting coal. CCS is one of the most expensive ways of reducing emissions in the energy sector. Deployment of this technology is very limited. As of 2024, CCS is used in only 5 power plants and in 39 other facilities.

====Nuclear power====
Nuclear power has been used since the 1950s as a low-carbon source of baseload electricity. Nuclear power plants in over 30 countries generate about 10% of global electricity. As of 2019, nuclear generated over a quarter of all low-carbon energy, making it the second largest source after hydropower.

Nuclear power&#x27;s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions—including the mining and processing of uranium—are similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources. Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced, compared to the major renewables. Additionally, Nuclear power does not create local air pollution. Although the uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, enough exists to provide a supply for hundreds to thousands of years. However, uranium resources that can be accessed in an economically feasible manner, at the present state, are limited and uranium production could hardly keep up during the expansion phase. Climate change mitigation pathways consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear.

There is controversy over whether nuclear power is sustainable, in part due to concerns around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents. Radioactive nuclear waste must be managed for thousands of years. For each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy has caused far fewer accidental and pollution-related deaths than fossil fuels, and the historic fatality rate of nuclear is comparable to renewable sources. Public opposition to nuclear energy often makes nuclear plants politically difficult to implement.

Reducing the time and the cost of building new nuclear plants have been goals for decades but costs remain high and timescales long. Various new forms of nuclear energy are in development, hoping to address the drawbacks of conventional plants. Fast breeder reactors are capable of recycling nuclear waste and therefore can significantly reduce the amount of waste that requires geological disposal, but have not yet been deployed on a large-scale commercial basis. Nuclear power based on thorium (rather than uranium) may be able to provide higher energy security for countries that do not have a large supply of uranium. Small modular reactors may have several advantages over current large reactors: It should be possible to build them faster and their modularization would allow for cost reductions via learning-by-doing.

Several countries are attempting to develop nuclear fusion reactors, which would generate small amounts of waste and no risk of explosions. Although fusion power has taken steps forward in the lab, the multi-decade timescale needed to bring it to commercialization and then scale means it will not contribute to a 2050 net zero goal for climate change mitigation.

==Energy system transformation==

=== Decarbonisation of the global energy system ===
The emissions reductions necessary to keep global warming below 2°C will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced, distributed, stored, and consumed. For a society to replace one form of energy with another, multiple technologies and behaviours in the energy system must change. For example, transitioning from oil to solar power as the energy source for cars requires the generation of solar electricity, modifications to the electrical grid to accommodate fluctuations in solar panel output or the introduction of variable battery chargers and higher overall demand, adoption of electric cars, and networks of electric vehicle charging facilities and repair shops. 

Many climate change mitigation pathways envision three main aspects of a low-carbon energy system: 

* The use of low-emission energy sources to produce electricity
* Electrification – that is increased use of electricity instead of directly burning fossil fuels
* Accelerated adoption of energy efficiency measures

Some energy-intensive technologies and processes are difficult to electrify, including aviation, shipping, and steelmaking. There are several options for reducing the emissions from these sectors: biofuels and synthetic carbon-neutral fuels can power many vehicles that are designed to burn fossil fuels, however biofuels cannot be sustainably produced in the quantities needed and synthetic fuels are currently very expensive. For some applications, the most prominent alternative to electrification is to develop a system based on sustainably-produced hydrogen fuel. 

Full decarbonisation of the global energy system is expected to take several decades and can mostly be achieved with existing technologies. In the IEA&#x27;s proposal for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, about 35% of the reduction in emissions depends on technologies that are still in development as of 2023. Technologies that are relatively immature include batteries and processes to create carbon-neutral fuels. Developing new technologies requires research and development, demonstration, and cost reductions via deployment.

The transition to a zero-carbon energy system will bring strong co-benefits for human health: The World Health Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions of lives each year from reductions to air pollution alone. With good planning and management, pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030 in ways that are consistent with climate goals. Historically, several countries have made rapid economic gains through coal usage. However, there remains a window of opportunity for many poor countries and regions to &quot;leapfrog&quot; fossil fuel dependency by developing their energy systems based on renewables, given adequate international investment and knowledge transfer.

===Integrating variable energy sources===

To deliver reliable electricity from variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, electrical power systems require flexibility. Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. In 2019, these sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity, a share that has grown rapidly.

There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar generation are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale: there is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low. Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines allows for further cancelling out of variability. Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids, matching the times when variable energy production is highest. With grid energy storage, energy produced in excess can be released when needed. Further flexibility could be provided from sector coupling, that is coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat-systems and electric vehicles.

Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure that enough electricity is produced even during poor weather. In optimal weather, energy generation may have to be curtailed if excess electricity cannot be used or stored. The final demand-supply mismatch may be covered by using dispatchable energy sources such as hydropower, bioenergy, or natural gas.

====Energy storage====

Energy storage helps overcome barriers to intermittent renewable energy and is an important aspect of a sustainable energy system. The most commonly used and available storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity, which requires locations with large differences in height and access to water. Batteries, especially lithium-ion batteries, are also deployed widely. Batteries typically store electricity for short periods; research is ongoing into technology with sufficient capacity to last through seasons. 

Costs of utility-scale batteries in the US have fallen by around 70% since 2015, however the cost and low energy density of batteries makes them impractical for the very large energy storage needed to balance inter-seasonal variations in energy production. Pumped hydro storage and power-to-gas (converting electricity to gas and back) with capacity for multi-month usage has been implemented in some locations.

=== Electrification ===

Compared to the rest of the energy system, emissions can be reduced much faster in the electricity sector. As of 2019, 37% of global electricity is produced from low-carbon sources (renewables and nuclear energy). Fossil fuels, primarily coal, produce the rest of the electricity supply. One of the easiest and fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to phase out coal-fired power plants and increase renewable electricity generation. 

Climate change mitigation pathways envision extensive electrification—the use of electricity as a substitute for the direct burning of fossil fuels for heating buildings and for transport. Ambitious climate policy would see a doubling of energy share consumed as electricity by 2050, from 20% in 2020. 

One of the challenges in providing universal access to electricity is distributing power to rural areas. Off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy, such as small solar PV installations that generate and store enough electricity for a village, are important solutions. Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators, which are currently common in the developing world. 

Infrastructure for generating and storing renewable electricity requires minerals and metals, such as cobalt and lithium for batteries and copper for solar panels. Recycling can meet some of this demand if product lifecycles are well-designed, however achieving net zero emissions would still require major increases in mining for 17 types of metals and minerals. A small group of countries or companies sometimes dominate the markets for these commodities, raising geopolitical concerns. Most of the world&#x27;s cobalt, for instance, is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a politically unstable region where mining is often associated with human rights risks. More diverse geographical sourcing may ensure a more flexible and less brittle supply chain.

===Hydrogen===
Hydrogen gas is widely discussed as a fuel with potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This requires hydrogen to be produced cleanly, in quantities to supply in sectors and applications where cheaper and more energy efficient mitigation alternatives are limited. These applications include heavy industry and long-distance transport.

Hydrogen can be deployed as an energy source in fuel cells to produce electricity, or via combustion to generate heat. When hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells, the only emission at the point of use is water vapour. Combustion of hydrogen can lead to the thermal formation of harmful nitrogen oxides. The overall lifecycle emissions of hydrogen depend on how it is produced. Nearly all of the world&#x27;s current supply of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels.

The main method of producing hydrogen is steam methane reforming, in which hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane, the main component of natural gas. Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits 6.6–9.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide. While carbon capture and storage (CCS) could remove a large fraction of these emissions, the overall carbon footprint of hydrogen from natural gas is difficult to assess , in part because of emissions (including vented and fugitive methane) created in the production of the natural gas itself. 

Electricity can be used to split water molecules, producing sustainable hydrogen provided the electricity was generated sustainably. However, this electrolysis process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from methane without CCS and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low. Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of variable renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity. It can be further transformed into liquid fuels such as green ammonia and green methanol. Innovation in hydrogen electrolysers could make large-scale production of hydrogen from electricity more cost-competitive. 

Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, thus contributing to the decarbonisation of industry alongside other technologies, such as electric arc furnaces for steelmaking. For steelmaking, hydrogen can function as a clean fuel and simultaneously as a low-carbon catalyst replacing coal-derived coke. Hydrogen used to decarbonise transportation is likely to find its largest applications in shipping, aviation and to a lesser extent heavy goods vehicles. For light duty vehicles including passenger cars, hydrogen is far behind other alternative fuel vehicles, especially compared with the rate of adoption of battery electric vehicles, and may not play a significant role in future.

Disadvantages of hydrogen as a fuel include high costs of storage and distribution due to hydrogen&#x27;s explosivity, its large volume compared to other fuels, and its tendency to make pipes brittle.

=== Energy usage technologies ===

====Transport====
Transport accounts for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but there are multiple ways to make transport more sustainable. Public transport typically emits fewer greenhouse gases per passenger than personal vehicles, since trains and buses can carry many more passengers at once. Short-distance flights can be replaced by high-speed rail, which is more efficient, especially when electrified. Promoting non-motorised transport such as walking and cycling, particularly in cities, can make transport cleaner and healthier. 

The energy efficiency of cars has increased over time, but shifting to electric vehicles is an important further step towards decarbonising transport and reducing air pollution. A large proportion of traffic-related air pollution consists of particulate matter from road dust and the wearing-down of tyres and brake pads. Substantially reducing pollution from these non-tailpipe sources cannot be achieved by electrification; it requires measures such as making vehicles lighter and driving them less. Light-duty cars in particular are a prime candidate for decarbonization using battery technology. 25% of the world&#x27;s  emissions still originate from the transportation sector. 

Long-distance freight transport and aviation are difficult sectors to electrify with current technologies, mostly because of the weight of batteries needed for long-distance travel, battery recharging times, and limited battery lifespans. Where available, freight transport by ship and rail is generally more sustainable than by air and by road. Hydrogen vehicles may be an option for larger vehicles such as lorries. Many of the techniques needed to lower emissions from shipping and aviation are still early in their development, with ammonia (produced from hydrogen) a promising candidate for shipping fuel. Aviation biofuel may be one of the better uses of bioenergy if emissions are captured and stored during manufacture of the fuel.

====Buildings====
Over one-third of energy use is in buildings and their construction. To heat buildings, alternatives to burning fossil fuels and biomass include electrification through heat pumps or electric heaters, geothermal energy, central solar heating, reuse of waste heat, and seasonal thermal energy storage. Heat pumps provide both heat and air conditioning through a single appliance. The IEA estimates heat pumps could provide over 90% of space and water heating requirements globally.

A highly efficient way to heat buildings is through district heating, in which heat is generated in a centralised location and then distributed to multiple buildings through insulated pipes. Traditionally, most district heating systems have used fossil fuels, but modern and cold district heating systems are designed to use high shares of renewable energy.Cooling of buildings can be made more efficient through passive building design, planning that minimises the urban heat island effect, and district cooling systems that cool multiple buildings with piped cold water. Air conditioning requires large amounts of electricity and is not always affordable for poorer households. Some air conditioning units still use refrigerants that are greenhouse gases, as some countries have not ratified the Kigali Amendment to only use climate-friendly refrigerants.

==== Cooking ====
In developing countries where populations suffer from energy poverty, polluting fuels such as wood or animal dung are often used for cooking. Cooking with these fuels is generally unsustainable, because they release harmful smoke and because harvesting wood can lead to forest degradation. The universal adoption of clean cooking facilities, which are already ubiquitous in rich countries, would dramatically improve health and have minimal negative effects on climate. Clean cooking facilities, e.g. cooking facilities that produce less indoor soot, typically use natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (both of which consume oxygen and produce carbon-dioxide) or electricity as the energy source; biogas systems are a promising alternative in some contexts. Improved cookstoves that burn biomass more efficiently than traditional stoves are an interim solution where transitioning to clean cooking systems is difficult.

====Industry====
Over one-third of energy use is by industry. Most of that energy is deployed in thermal processes: generating heat, drying, and refrigeration. The share of renewable energy in industry was 14.5% in 2017—mostly low-temperature heat supplied by bioenergy and electricity. The most energy-intensive activities in industry have the lowest shares of renewable energy, as they face limitations in generating heat at temperatures over .

For some industrial processes, commercialisation of technologies that have not yet been built or operated at full scale will be needed to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Steelmaking, for instance, is difficult to electrify because it traditionally uses coke, which is derived from coal, both to create very high-temperature heat and as an ingredient in the steel itself. The production of plastic, cement, and fertilisers also requires significant amounts of energy, with limited possibilities available to decarbonise. A switch to a circular economy would make industry more sustainable as it involves recycling more and thereby using less energy compared to investing energy to mine and refine new raw materials.

==Government policies==
Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security and lessen the financial burden of using energy. 

Environmental regulations have been used since the 1970s to promote more sustainable use of energy. Some governments have committed to dates for phasing out coal-fired power plants and ending new fossil fuel exploration. Governments can require that new cars produce zero emissions, or new buildings are heated by electricity instead of gas. Renewable portfolio standards in several countries require utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources.

Governments can accelerate energy system transformation by leading the development of infrastructure such as long-distance electrical transmission lines, smart grids, and hydrogen pipelines. In transport, appropriate infrastructure and incentives can make travel more efficient and less car-dependent. Urban planning that discourages sprawl can reduce energy use in local transport and buildings while enhancing quality of life. Government-funded research, procurement, and incentive policies have historically been critical to the development and maturation of clean energy technologies, such as solar and lithium batteries. In the IEA&#x27;s scenario for a net zero-emission energy system by 2050, public funding is rapidly mobilised to bring a range of newer technologies to the demonstration phase and to encourage deployment.
Carbon pricing (such as a tax on emissions) gives industries and consumers an incentive to reduce emissions while letting them choose how to do so. For example, they can shift to low-emission energy sources, improve energy efficiency, or reduce their use of energy-intensive products and services. Carbon pricing has encountered strong political pushback in some jurisdictions, whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer. Most studies indicate that to limit global warming to 1.5°C, carbon pricing would need to be complemented by stringent energy-specific policies. 

As of 2019, the price of carbon in most regions is too low to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Carbon taxes provide a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes or help lower-income households afford higher energy costs. Some governments, such as the EU and the UK, are exploring the use of carbon border adjustments. These place tariffs on imports from countries with less stringent climate policies, to ensure that industries subject to internal carbon prices remain competitive. 

The scale and pace of policy reforms that have been initiated as of 2020 are far less than needed to fulfil the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition to domestic policies, greater international cooperation is required to accelerate innovation and to assist poorer countries in establishing a sustainable path to full energy access.

Countries may support renewables to create jobs. The International Labour Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 2 °C would result in net job creation in most sectors of the economy. It predicts that 24 million new jobs would be created by 2030 in areas such as renewable electricity generation, improving energy-efficiency in buildings, and the transition to electric vehicles. Six million jobs would be lost, in sectors such as mining and fossil fuels. Governments can make the transition to sustainable energy more politically and socially feasible by ensuring a just transition for workers and regions that depend on the fossil fuel industry, to ensure they have alternative economic opportunities.

==Finance==
Raising enough money for innovation and investment is a prerequisite for the energy transition. The IPCC estimates that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, US$2.4 trillion would need to be invested in the energy system each year between 2016 and 2035. Most studies project that these costs, equivalent to 2.5% of world GDP, would be small compared to the economic and health benefits. Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be six times more by 2050 compared to 2015. Underfunding is particularly acute in the least developed countries, which are not attractive to the private sector. 

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimates that climate financing totalled $681 billion in 2016. Most of this is private-sector investment in renewable energy deployment, public-sector investment in sustainable transport, and private-sector investment in energy efficiency. The Paris Agreement includes a pledge of an extra $100 billion per year from developed countries to poor countries, to do climate change mitigation and adaptation. This goal has not been met and measurement of progress has been hampered by unclear accounting rules. If energy-intensive businesses like chemicals, fertilizers, ceramics, steel, and non-ferrous metals invest significantly in R&amp;D, its usage in industry might amount to between 5% and 20% of all energy used.

Fossil fuel funding and subsidies are a significant barrier to the energy transition. Direct global fossil fuel subsidies were $319 billion in 2017. This rises to $5.2 trillion when indirect costs are priced in, like the effects of air pollution. Ending these could lead to a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths. Funding for clean energy has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and pandemic-related economic stimulus packages offer possibilities for a green recovery.

<doc id="1055895" wikidata="Q1760220" url="?curid=1055895" title="Pessac-Léognan">
<text>Pessac-Léognan () is a wine growing area and Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée, in the northern part of the Graves region of Bordeaux. Unlike most Bordeaux appellations, Pessac-Léognan is equally famous for both red and (dry) white wines, although red wine is still predominant. It includes the only red-wine producer outside the Haut-Médoc classified in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, the &quot;premier cru&quot; Château Haut-Brion, and also includes all of the châteaux listed in the 1953/59 classification of Graves. These classed growths account for a third of the wine produced in Pessac-Léognan.

==Geography==
Pessac-Léognan, France lies on the left bank of the Garonne. It is immediately south of the city of Bordeaux (with a small portion to the west): indeed some of the northern vineyards of Pessac-Léognan are completely surrounded by the housing estates of Bordeaux, as a result of the city&#x27;s southward expansion. It consists of 8 communes: (from north to south) Mérignac, Talence, Pessac, Gradignan, Villenave-d&#x27;Ornon, Cadaujac, Léognan and Martillac. A significant part of the area is forested. It includes of vines. The soil is very gravelly.

==History==
Pessac-Léognan has a long wine-making history. Red wine from this region (and the rest of Graves) was the wine originally loved by the English as &quot;claret&quot;, during the 300 years that Aquitaine was under English rule, from 1152 to 1453. The area includes the oldest named property in Bordeaux, Château Pape Clément, founded by Pope Clement V in 1306. In the mid-seventeenth century, Château Haut-Brion became the first château of international renown, being praised by Samuel Pepys in 1663, while the Médoc was still swamp.

However, the &quot;appellation&quot; of Pessac-Léognan is relatively recent, dating to 1987. Before then, the area was part of the Graves AOC, and known informally as &quot;Haut-Graves&quot;.

==Wine==
===Red wine===
As with the Médoc to the north, Cabernet Sauvignon is the predominant grape, but a somewhat greater proportion of Merlot is typically used in the blend. Cabernet Franc is also used, with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Styles vary more widely than in most Bordeaux AOCs, but typical flavours are blackcurrant and cedar, and the wines are often described as &#x27;earthy&#x27;.

===White wine===
Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon are the grapes used, usually blended. The wine is typically fermented in barrels at a low temperature. Nectarine is a typical flavor when the wines are young, maturing (over 7–15 years) into flavours of nuts, honey and custard. They are said to be among France&#x27;s greatest whites.

==Food matching==
The traditional pairing for reds is with roast lamb, although they are flexible enough to have with ham, beef or game. The whites complement fish and seafood.

<text>Demon Attack is a fixed shooter video game created by Rob Fulop for the Atari 2600 and published by Imagic in 1982. The game involves the player controlling a laser cannon from the surface of a planet, shooting winged demons that fly down and attack the player in different sets of patterns.

Fulop designed the game after leaving Atari, saying he was not properly reimbursed for his work on a port of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. He co-founded the company Imagic in 1981 and began developing &quot;Demon Attack&quot;. It was the first game he developed that had a graphic artist, Michael Becker, who created eight-phase animations for the demons. On the games release in 1982, it received positive critical attention for its graphics and gameplay and became one of the best-selling Atari 2600 games, and the best-selling game developed by Imagic.

Programmer Gary Kato created a port of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; for the Intellivision console which added a final boss mothership. The boss was similar in gameplay to the final boss in &quot;Phoenix&quot; (1980), a game Atari had exclusive console rights to. This led to Atari filing a suit against Imagic. A settlement was reached in January 1983, with Imagic being allowed to release &quot;Demon Attack&quot; for several video game consoles and home computers in the 1980s.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Demon Attack&quot; is set on a surface of a planet, when strange winged creatures float above, threatening the player. They attack, leading the player to retaliate by shooting at them with a laser cannon. 

Matthew House of AllGame described the game as a fixed shooter. The players start with three lives, called bunkers in the game, which are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Each time the players are hit by enemy fire, they lose a bunker, and the game ends when all bunkers are depleted. The waves of enemies grow more complex as the game progresses, with wave five having enemies divide into two smaller enemies after being shot. Later waves feature enemies who will dive towards the laser canon.

The players can move left and right at the bottom of the screen to avoid enemies. The game offers different modes of play, including a Tracer Shot mode, which allows the player to guide lasers after they are shot. Two-player games can either be played competitively against each other or as a co-op mode. In the co-op mode, the two players alternate every four seconds on who controls moving and firing the ship&#x27;s laser. In competitive mode, each player controls their own laser cannon at simultaneously with their own score and bunker count. If one player loses all their bunkers, the other player continues until all bunkers are lost. 

In the Intellivision version, the boss fight with the demon flagship named Pandemonium appears after three waves of enemies are defeated. It is destroyed by eroding its shield with lasers shots and aiming for a small rotating wheel of vulnerability.

==Development==
Prior to working on &quot;Demon Attack&quot;, Rob Fulop worked at Atari developing sound effects for pinball machines as a summer job while studying electrical engineering at the University of California. Fulop&#x27;s later projects included adaptations of arcade games such as &quot;Night Driver&quot; and &quot;Missile Command&quot; for the Atari 2600 and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; for the Atari 8-bit computers. He said that he expected a strong Christmas bonus from Atari based on how well &quot;Space Invaders&quot; had done commercially, but he only received a voucher for a free turkey dinner. Fulop then left Atari, and upon seeing how well Activision has been doing, he co-founded the company Imagic on July 17, 1981.

Fulop said that &quot;I was angry at Atari and wanted to make something so good, they&#x27;d cry when they saw it. A lot of the best work is motivated by a desire to show someone what they&#x27;ve missed out on&quot;. This led to him designing &quot;Demon Attack&quot;. He said the game was modeled after &quot;Galaxian&quot;. The game took nine months to create. &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was the second original game Fulop had begun developing, as he had also worked on an original game at Atari that was never completed. The first complete version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; just had one pattern of enemies repeated endlessly. Fulop focused on creating more motions for the enemies to give them more of an organic movement pattern. It was the first game he developed that had a graphic artist, Michael Becker, who created eight-phase animation for the demons. Fulop later said that &quot;I had to fight to keep the game in the lab for the last month, my mistake in finishing everything before polishing the motion - marketing was eager to ship it - I insisted on holding it back. It got quite heated&quot;.

Fulop only created the original game for the Atari 2600 and consulted on the Intellivision adaptation. Pat Ransil of Imagic said that the Atari 2600&#x27;s hardware permitted smooth and easy movement across the screen horizontally, so Fulop designed the enemy demons to move on a mostly horizontal plane. Gary Kato designed the Intellivision version of the game, which allowed the demons to move in any direction, as the system allowed for that in an easier way. Kato&#x27;s version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; features a final boss and less colorful enemies than the Atari 2600 version, but featured other visual elements such as displaying the Moon&#x27;s surface and having Earth in the background. Kato said he could not make the game look like the Atari version on the Intellivision, and credited Becker, who he described as Imagic&#x27;s &quot;head art guy&quot;, for creating the look of the boss enemy Pandemonium. Kato said &quot;when my eyes saw this, my mouth was hanging open, as soon as people started coming into work, I rushed back down and said...I have to have this in the game!&quot; Kato concluded that if any art looked good in the game, it was created by Becker, while anything that did not look strong was his own. Fulop has said he worked closely with David Johnson on the Atari Computer version of the game, but that he generally just wrote three-page documents for the other versions on how the algorithms of his code worked. There was no shared code for the later ports. Johnson would also code the Magnavox Odyssey 2 version of the game. A similar mother ship appears in the Commodore 64 version of the game.

==Release==

&quot;Demon Attack&quot; was released in March 1982 for the Atari 2600 along with two other Imagic games: &quot;Star Voyager&quot; and &quot;Trick Shot&quot;. Becker created the cover art for the game from model toys painted silver and blue.

By the end of 1982, the Atari 2600 version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was the third highest selling console game of the year, only being beaten by &quot;Pitfall!&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The game was also released for other consoles such as the Intellivision and Magnavox Odyssey 2. The Intellivision version was the 9th highest grossing game of 1982. The Magnavox Odyssey 2 version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was the first cartridge for the system by an independent publisher. It was also ported to several home computers, including the TI-99/4A, the Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, VIC-20, TRS-80 Color Computer and IBM PCjr. The game was retitled &quot;Super Demon Attack&quot; for its release on the TI-99/4A computer and a port of the Odyssey 2 version called &quot;Demon Attack Plus&quot; when it was released for the Philips Videopac+ G7400 in France. &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was included in the &quot;Activision Anthology&quot; compilation, but was removed for the Game Boy Advance release.

Kato&#x27;s version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; for the Intellivision features a final boss named Pandemonium that is similar to the boss in the arcade game &quot;Phoenix&quot; (1980). Fulop had played Kato&#x27;s version of the game and disliked the addition of the boss. He said: &quot;That, to me, was totally stupid. I mean, it&#x27;s exactly the same game [as &quot;Phoenix&quot;]&quot;. Atari had the exclusive rights to produce &quot;Phoenix&quot; for home consoles and filed suit against the company Imagic, believing that the Intellivision version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was too derivative of the arcade game. A settlement was reached in January 1983, with Imagic still being allowed to release &quot;Demon Attack&quot;. When asked about the legal issues between Atari and Imagic related to &quot;Demon Attack&quot;, Fulop responded that he &quot;kept out of a lot of that. It was basically a silly hustling and political thing. I think I went to one deposition, that was it [...] No one really cared too much about it&quot;. &quot;Demon Attack&quot; went on to became the best selling Imagic game.

==Reception==

In the British magazine &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, a reviewer wrote that &quot;Demon Attack&quot;″s enormous success was due to the tough game play and exceptional graphics. Reviews in other publications praised the graphics, with Jan Yarnot of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; and Randi Hacker in &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; describing the enemies as being &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;vibrantly colorful&quot; respectively. Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz wrote in &quot;Video&quot; went as far to say that &quot;Demon Attack&quot; had the best graphics among the most recent Atari 2600 games. Commenting on the gameplay, Yarnot said that the different enemy patterns made the game appropriately challenging. A reviewer in &quot;JoyStik How to Win at Video Games&quot; also commented that enemy movement was unpredictable, concluding that the game was &quot;simply one of the best game cartridges of its type available today&quot;. Yarnot commented negatively that the difficulty did not increase after the 12th wave, with earlier enemy patterns being repeated.

Reviewing later ports, Phil Wiswell of &quot;Video Games&quot; said that while the Atari 2600 version was very good, the Intellivision version was even better, declaring that it has &quot;one of the nicest TV-game graphics ever&quot;. A reviewer in &quot;Blip&quot; compared &quot;Demon Attack&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot;, finding the Intellivision version was the best of the three, saying its addition of the final battle made it and &quot;Phoenix&quot; and the Atari 2600 version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; feel like a &quot;Galaxian&quot; spin-offs. The reviewer from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; compared the Intellivision game to Atari&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot;, stating &quot;Demon Attack&quot; had a slight edge, concluding that &quot;&quot;Phoenix&quot; is pretty tough but for my money &quot;Demon Attack&quot; is tougher and prettier&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited the Atari 8-bit verson as &quot;a real shoot-&#x27;em-up that demands your quickest reflexes&quot;. A review in &quot;Ahoy!&quot; found the VIC-20 version excellent but said that it was not enhanced in any major way over the Atari 2600 game. Art Lewis of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; found the Odyssey 2 port not as smoothly colorful or as polished as the Atari 2600 original. Michael Blanchet, author of &quot;How to Beat the Video Games&quot;, praised the Odyssey 2 port as setting a new standard for games for the system, concluding that players should &quot;find out what millions of Atari and Intellivision owners already know - Imagic&#x27;s &quot;Demon Attack&quot; is one heck of a game&quot;.

&quot;Demon Attack&quot; won the 1983 Arcade Award for &quot;Video Game of the Year&quot;, with Kunkel and Katz saying the game had superior graphics, sound and was &quot;a challenge to the mental and physical capabilities of home arcaders&quot;. &quot;Video Games Player&quot; tallied twenty writers, editors and critics of the video game field and had &quot;Demon Attack&quot; voted as the &quot;Space Game of the year&quot; in their 1983 Golden Joystick Awards. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine had their first Annual Video Game Awards conference in 1983, where Fulop was awarded the designer of the year for &quot;Demon Attack&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, a reviewer from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; found the game to be a clone of &quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; but still found it to be a great game. GameSpy included the game in their Hall of Fame in 2002. GameSpy writer William Cassidy wrote that original &quot;Space Invaders&quot;-styled games on home consoles ranged from forgettable to pretty good, but &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was a standout due to its fast-paced action, responsive control, and audio-visual appeal. Brett Weiss included the game in his book &quot;The 100 Greatest Console Video Games 1977-1987&quot; (2014), due to its popularity on its release, and that it remained &quot;a dynamic nicely animated shooter&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included &quot;Demon Attack&quot; in their list of top ten games for the Intellivision, compliments the versions graphics, mothership boss, and that it was superior to the Atari 2600 version. The publication would also name the game in their list of best Atari 2600 (at 13th) and VIC-20 games (at 6th).

==Legacy==
On the game&#x27;s success, Fulop responded that he knew the game would do well, but did not think it would do as well as it did. Fulop felt that &quot;Cosmic Ark&quot;, his next game at Imagic, was not going to be as strong, noting that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t hungry in the same way - wasn&#x27;t into &#x27;making them cry&#x27;&quot;. Fulop said that Imagic wanted to make a sequel to &quot;Demon Attack&quot;, but &quot;I was too stupid to realize the sequel makes a lot more money&quot;. He made other games for the Atari 2600 and later went on to develop games like &quot;Night Trap&quot; and create the popular &quot;Petz&quot; series.

Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort in their book &quot;Racing the Beam&quot; (2009) stated that &quot;Demon Attack&quot; &quot;broke the mold&quot; of development in console games by having a dedicated artist for game development with Michael Becker&#x27;s contributions to the game, noting that prior to this, an artist working in game development would only work on the box art or designed a game&#x27;s printed manual.

<text>The Schenectady Locomotive Works built railroad locomotives from its founding in 1848 through its merger into American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1901.

After the 1901 merger, ALCO made the Schenectady plant its headquarters in Schenectady, New York.

One of the better-known locomotives to come out of the Schenectady shops was Central Pacific Railroad type 4-4-0 No. 60, the &quot;Jupiter&quot; (built in September 1868), one of two steam locomotives to take part in the &quot;Golden Spike Ceremony&quot; to celebrate the completion of the First transcontinental railroad. Although the original was scrapped in 1909, a full-scale, operating replica was completed in 1979, and now is part of an operational display at the Golden Spike National Historical Park.

<doc id="1055904" wikidata="Q1128708" url="?curid=1055904" title="Florida Everblades">
<text>The Florida Everblades are a professional minor league ice hockey team based in Estero, Florida, in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers metropolitan area. They play in the ECHL and are affiliated with the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Springfield Thunderbirds of the American Hockey League (AHL) starting in the 2024–25 ECHL season. Their home games are played at Hertz Arena.

The Everblades were founded in 1998. They play in the South Division of the Eastern Conference in the ECHL. They have failed to qualify for the playoffs just once in team history (2013–14) and have made seven appearances in the Kelly Cup finals, winning in 2012, 2022, 2023, and 2024; the latter three appearances constituted the first three-peat in ECHL history.

==History==
The team was founded in 1998 by Craig Brush, Peter Karmanos Jr., and Thomas Thewes and was named based on the Florida Everglades. The Everblades&#x27; logo features a gator-head design fused in the form of an ice skate. Barnstorm Creative Group, a Vancouver graphic design company, designed the logo. Barnstorm was contacted by Carolina Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos Jr., who came up with the idea of choosing the Everblades&#x27; colors as blue and green, in tribute to the Hartford Whalers team that Karmanos moved to Raleigh, North Carolina. The Everblades&#x27; inaugural home opener featured a pre-game ceremony in which a large alligator was brought onto the ice to pay tribute to the team&#x27;s name and logo, as well as Florida&#x27;s vast population of reptile species. The Everblades won their first Kelly Cup on May 23, 2012, against the Las Vegas Wranglers. Brandon MacLean scored the championship-winning-goal in overtime during game five. Everblades goaltender, John Muse, was named the most valuable player of the 2012 Kelly Cup playoffs.

===2012 Kelly Cup Finals===
Florida won the 2012 Kelly Cup playoffs with a 4–1 victory at home in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 7,290. The first period saw Las Vegas Wranglers goalie Joe Fallon beaten by Justin Shugg and Mike Ratchuk, but Las Vegas edged back to even the score by the third, with Ash Goldie and Peter MacArthur beating John Muse to force the overtime. At 4:54 into the overtime, after Ryan Donald passed to Matt Beca, who in turn sent the puck to Brandon MacLean, who beat Fallon and secured the victory.

The win earned Florida the 2012 Kelly Cup and secured a perfect home record of 11–0 in the postseason (two victories over Greenville and three each over Elmira, Kalamazoo, and Las Vegas). Additionally, John Muse earned the Kelly Cup Finals MVP award.

=== Ownership and affiliation changes ===
In April 2013, owner Peter Karmanos, Jr. announced he would be selling the team along with Germain Arena to &quot;simplify things&quot; in his life, as he had just retired from the company he founded, Compuware. The team was made for sale and was being shopped by Park Lane, a sports investment-banking firm that specializes in the sale of sports teams. In 2018, Karmanos gave up majority control of the Hurricanes to new majority owner Thomas Dundon. After the 2018–19 season, the Everblades dropped the Hurricanes affiliation for the first time and partnered with the Nashville Predators. It was then announced on August 5, 2019, that Karmanos had sold both the team and arena to David Hoffmann, a Naples, Florida, resident and real estate investor. Starting in the 2022–23 season, the Everblades ended their affiliation with the Predators and entered a multi-year agreement with the Florida Panthers. On June 13, 2024, team president Craig Brush announced that the team would not be renewing its agreement with the Panthers. On July 10 of that year, the Everblades announced a new multi-year agreement with the St. Louis Blues.

==Logos==
Through the Everblades&#x27; history, they have had five anniversary logos: the fifth anniversary logo in 2002–03, the 10th anniversary logo in 2007–08, the 15th anniversary logo in 2012–13, the 20th anniversary logo in 2017–18, and the 25th anniversary logo in 2022–23.

===Retired numbers===

Berg and Buckley&#x27;s numbers were retired during a pre-game ceremony on October 19, 2007, as the Everblades hosted the Mississippi Sea Wolves, in what would be the Sea Wolves&#x27; first official regular season game after being placed on a two-year hiatus due to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Banners made with their jersey numbers were hung to the rafters of Germain Arena.

Hartlieb&#x27;s number was retired in a ceremony before a game against the Orlando Solar Bears on October 19, 2012. Hartlieb was presented with an ECHL Championship ring (he filled in on with the team in the 2011–12 regular season, but did not appear in the playoffs), and hoisted the Kelly Cup. A banner made with his number was hung to the rafters of Germain Arena next to Berg and Buckley&#x27;s.

<text>The Réunion hotspot is a volcanic hotspot which currently lies under the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The Chagos-Laccadive Ridge and the southern part of the Mascarene Plateau are volcanic traces of the Réunion hotspot.

The hotspot is believed to have been active for over 65 million years. A huge eruption of this hotspot 65 million years ago is thought to have laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers part of central India, and opened a rift which separated India from the Seychelles Plateau. The Deccan Traps eruption coincided roughly with the nearly antipodal Chicxulub impactor and the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction of the dinosaurs, and there is considerable speculation that the three events were related. As the Indian plate drifted north, the hotspot continued to punch through the plate, creating a string of volcanic islands and undersea plateaux. The Laccadive Islands, the Maldives, and the Chagos Archipelago are atolls resting on former volcanoes created 60–45 million years ago that subsequently submerged below sea level. About 45 million years ago the Central Indian Ridge crossed over the hotspot, and the hotspot passed under the African Plate.

The hotspot appears to have been relatively quiet 45–10 million years ago, when activity resumed, creating the Mascarene Islands, which include Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues. Mauritius and Rodrigues Ridge were created 8–10 million years ago, and Rodrigues and Réunion Islands in the last two million years. Piton de la Fournaise, a shield volcano on the southeastern corner of Réunion, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world.

<text>Bret Michael Sychak (born March 15, 1963), known professionally as Bret Michaels, is an American singer and musician. He is the frontman of rock band Poison which has sold over 65 million albums worldwide and 30 million records in the United States. The band has also charted 10 singles to the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including six Top 10 singles and a number-one single, &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;.

Besides his career as frontman, he has several solo albums to his credit, including the soundtrack album to the 1998 film &quot;A Letter from Death Row&quot; in which Michaels starred, wrote and directed, and a rock album, &quot;Songs of Life&quot;, in 2003. Michaels has appeared in several films and TV shows, including as a judge on the talent show &quot;Nashville Star&quot; which led to his country influenced rock album &quot;Freedom of Sound&quot; in 2005. He starred in the hit VH1 reality show &quot;Rock of Love with Bret Michaels&quot; and its sequels, which inspired his successful solo album &quot;Rock My World&quot;. He was also the winning contestant on NBC&#x27;s reality show &quot;Celebrity Apprentice 3&quot; and also featured in his own reality docuseries &quot;Bret Michaels: Life as I Know It&quot;, which inspired his highest-charting album as a solo artist, &quot;Custom Built&quot;, reaching No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hard Rock chart. He is also known for hosting on the Travel Channel. In 2006, &quot;Hit Parader&quot; ranked Michaels at No. 40 on their list of greatest heavy metal singers of all time.

==Early life==
Michaels was born Bret Michael Sychak on March 15, 1963, to Wally and Marjorie Sychak, north of Pittsburgh in the town of Chicora, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. He attended Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School. He has two sisters, Michelle and Nicole. He claims that his parents had originally intended for him to have the middle name &quot;Maverick&quot;, after the title character in the popular James Garner TV Western series &quot;Maverick&quot;. He is of Carpatho-Rusyn (from his paternal grandfather), Irish, English, German, and Swiss descent. Bret&#x27;s great-uncle Nick Sychak fought at Omaha Beach in the Invasion of Normandy and was killed in action in France in 1944.

At the age of 6, Michaels fell ill, and during a three-week stay in the hospital, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.

==Music career==
Michaels began playing the guitar as a teenager, forming a band with drummer Rikki Rockett, bass player Bobby Dall and guitarist David Besselman. Shortly thereafter, Besselman left the band due to creative differences and in 1983 the band hired Matt Smith to form a new band named Paris in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. In early 1984 the band tired of playing the Pennsylvania bar circuit, changed their name to Poison and moved west to Los Angeles to seek fame on the Sunset Boulevard scene. That same year, Michaels met 16-year-old Tracy Lewis, who would become both his girlfriend and the muse for one of his most memorable songs. Eventually, Matt Smith tired of the band&#x27;s struggle to find fame and returned home. He was replaced by C.C. DeVille, who would become both Michaels&#x27; friend and a source of conflict.

===1980s–1990s===
Local publicity about the band eventually led to a record deal with Enigma Records, and their first album, &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;. The album was not a great success until 1987, when Michaels convinced the band to film a video for their song, &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;. The album went platinum, and the band became famous. In March of that year, Poison headlined a show at Madison Square Garden. Michaels took his insulin injection before the show but was so nervous about performing that he neglected to eat. Several songs into Poison&#x27;s set, Michaels went into insulin shock and collapsed onstage. When subsequent media reports alleged that Michaels collapsed due to a drug overdose, Michaels publicly announced that he was a diabetic.

1987 also saw the dissolution of his relationship with Lewis, who felt that fame had changed him. Though Michaels contends that Lewis was unfaithful to him, Lewis (now Lewis Crosby) insists that it was Michaels who was unfaithful. Michaels was inspired by the breakup to write &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;, explaining that the rose represented his fame and success, whereas the loss of his relationship represented the thorn. The song was released as a power ballad single in December 1988, and is regarded as &quot;the ultimate &#x27;80s anthem about heartbreak&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Poison became one of the biggest glam metal bands in the world, recording their second album, the multi-platinum selling &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot;, and their third album, the multi-platinum selling &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;. However, their lives were characterized by the escalating tension between Michaels and DeVille that derived from their mutual drug use, which came to a head during their 1990/91 &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; world tour. Also cited is the spectacle of DeVille&#x27;s behavior during the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. After getting into a fistfight with Michaels, DeVille left the band, and descended further into addiction. Poison went on with new guitarist Richie Kotzen recording the Gold album &quot;Native Tongue&quot; and then with guitarist Blues Saraceno recording the album &quot;Crack a Smile... and More!&quot;. In the mid-1990s, after a night of partying, Michaels came close to dying when he crashed his Ferrari into a telephone pole. He incurred serious injury, including broken ribs, a disfigured nose, and lost teeth.
In 1999, The band reunited with original guitarist, C.C. Deville. Poison went on a successful greatest hits reunion tour. In the next decade, Bret Michaels would split his time between Poison and a successful solo career.

<doc id="1055916" wikidata="Q546249" url="?curid=1055916" title="National parks of Greece">
<text>Greece is characterized by an extremely fragmented, rugged landscape hosting a great diversity of ecosystems and an outstanding biodiversity. Almost 5% of its extensive coastline consists of ecologically sensitive wetlands. Two thirds of the total population live no further than 2 km from the coast and most of the important urban centers are coastal, while almost all of the tourist infrastructure is divided among islands and the coastal mainland.

==Greek climate==
Greece&#x27;s climate is divided into three classes: A Mediterranean climate features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Temperatures rarely reach extremes, although snowfalls do occur occasionally even in Athens, Cyclades or Crete during the winter. An alpine climate is found primarily in Western Greece (Epirus, Central Greece, Thessaly, Western Macedonia as well as central parts of the Peloponnese like Achaea, Arkadia and parts of Lakonia where the Alpine range pass by). A temperate climate is found in Central and Eastern Macedonia as well as in Thrace at places like Komotini, Xanthi and northern Evros; with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers.

==History and legislation==
The tradition of protected areas in Greece dates back to Ancient Greek times and the Altis and sacred grove at Olympia, amongst other sanctuaries. In more recent times, the country&#x27;s climatic and biological diversity, along with the rich flora and fauna that comes with it, made the need for the creation of national parks obvious as early as 1937, when the government of Ioannis Metaxas first issued a law that established national parks in Greece, Law 856/1937 On National Woodland Parks, itself building on the &quot;protected forests&quot; of the Forest Code of 1929. In 1938, the first national park was established, centred on Mount Olympus, followed later in the same year by a second, centred on Mount Parnassus. In 1986, the legal framework was overhauled by Law 1650/1986, Article 19 of which provides for the following types of protected area:
* Absolute Nature Reserves Areas
* Nature Reserve Areas
* National Parks
* Protected Natural Formations, Protected Landscapes and Landscape Elements
* Eco-development Areas

Among the National Parks, according to Article 19 Section 3, where a National Park (εθνικό πάρκο) has a predominantly marine or forested character, it may become a National Marine Park (θαλάσσιο πάρκο) or National Woodland Park (εθνικός δρυμός).

==List of national parks==
According to the World Database on Protected Areas, as of May 2022, there are 10 National Woodland Parks (εθνικοί δρυμοί), 2 National Marine Parks (θαλάσσια πάρκα), and 15 National Parks (εθνικά πάρκα).

===National Woodland Parks===
===National Marine Parks===
===National Parks===
==Layout==
Each national park consists of a core and the area surrounding it. According to Greek Law the core cannot be smaller than , with the exception of marine national parks. The surrounding area must be larger than, or at least equal to, the size of the core.

In the core of the national park, only scientific research, mild recreational activities, and the acquiring of environment related information are permitted. The creation of menageries, fish farms, the building of roads, outposts, camping and hiking infrastructures, along with woodcutting infrastructures and pastures are permitted in the surrounding area of the national park.

<text>Thale () is a town in the Harz district in Saxony-Anhalt in central Germany. Located at the steep northeastern rim of the Harz mountain range, it is known for the scenic Bode Gorge stretching above the town centre.

==Geography==
The town is situated on the river Bode, approximately west of Quedlinburg. Served by Transdev Sachsen-Anhalt trains, Thale Hauptbahnhof is the terminus of the Magdeburg–Thale railway line. The town has access to the Bundesstraße 6n highway.

=== Divisions ===
The town Thale consists of Thale proper and the following &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Allrode
*Altenbrak (incl. Alsmfeld and Wendefurth)
*Friedrichsbrunn
*Neinstedt
*Stecklenberg
*Treseburg
*Warnstedt
*Weddersleben
*Westerhausen
== History ==
The settlement of Thale probably emerged at the beginning of the 10th century. It was documented in 936 in connexion with the neighbouring Wendhusen Abbey, which had been founded around 825 AD as a chapter of canonesses (&quot;Kanonissenstift&quot;). Established by an Eastphalian comital family and based on the model of Herford Abbey, it was one of the first monasteries in the medieval Duchy of Saxony. After Queen Dowager Matilda, wife of the late King Henry the Fowler, tried in vain to relocate the convent in 936, it came under the guardianship of the newly established Quedlinburg chapter.

The adjacent village was first mentioned in a 1231 deed as &quot;Dat Dorp to dem Dale&quot; (from 1288 it was given the Latinised description &quot;de valle&quot;, and from 1303 as &quot;von Thale&quot;). In the late Middle Ages, the estates were held by the Saxon Counts of Regenstein, vassals of the Halberstadt prince-bishops. The monastery premises were stormed and devastated in 1525 during the German Peasants&#x27; War.

From 1445 the records show that there had been an ironworks in Thale. It was rebuilt from 1648 onwards after the devastations of the Thirty Years&#x27; War as the &quot;Berghaus zum Wilden Mann&quot;, but was fully destroyed in 1670. After the secularised Halberstadt territories were incorporated by Brandenburg-Prussia, a small hammer mill was established in 1686 out of which a new ironworks later developed that benefited especially from its proximity to the ore deposits and the availability of wood. It lasted until 1714. In 1740 a business was opened again. For a short time this ironworks was owned by the Prussian king Frederick the Great. 

Part of the Prussian Province of Saxony since 1815, the first wrought-iron wagon axle to be made in the German lands was manufactured here in 1831. In 1835 the oldest sheet steel enamel works in Europe was founded in Thale. Following the town&#x27;s connexion to the railway network in 1862 with a line to Berlin the place flourished as did the number of workers. Whilst the iron industry had only 350 workers in 1872, by 1905 there were as many as 4,400. In particular, the production of enamel contributed to Thale&#x27;s international renown; in its heyday Thale produced no less than 10% of the world&#x27;s production. In 1910 Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin spoke to Thale&#x27;s workers. From 1916 steel helmets were produced in Thale. In the World War II Thale had the monopoly on this product (from 1934).

Tourism blossomed from the 19th century onwards in connexion with the radon rich water of the Hubertus Spring, which had been opened up in 1836. As a result, various literary figures visited the place, including Heinrich Heine (&quot;Die Harzreise&quot;) and Theodor Fontane and especially the Bode Gorge. In addition tourists from Berlin enjoyed the summer resort of Thale. This encouraged the connexion of Thale in 1862 to the railway line from Wegeleben. In 1909 a branch line from Blankenburg (Harz) followed. In 1922 the resort was given town rights. From 12 to 14 June 2009 Thale was the venue for the Saxony-Anhalt Day held under the motto &quot;Thale sagenhaft&quot; (&quot;Legendary Thale&quot;), and attracted around 200,000 visitors.

=== Incorporation of other municipalities ===
Warnstedt was incorporated in 2003. In 2009 a total of seven municipalities were incorporated on four separate dates. Westerhausen was added in 2010. Allrode became a part of the town of Thale in 2011.

<text>Silent Fall is a 1994 American psychological thriller film directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Linda Hamilton, John Lithgow, J. T. Walsh, and Liv Tyler in her debut role. The plot focuses on a boy with autism who is the only witness to the savage double murder of his parents.

==Plot==
Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Warden, an autistic boy, has supposedly witnessed his parents&#x27; ruthless murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child&#x27;s mind in order to solve the case.

The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim&#x27;s sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake&#x27;s efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care.

Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim&#x27;s memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase &quot;God Damn&quot;, which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder.

Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim&#x27;s strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim&#x27;s father was molesting him.

That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead panickedly paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him. Tim mimics the police chief&#x27;s voice through the phone to lure Sylvie to the police station and pulls Jake out of the lake while she is away.

Sylvie returns and Jake reveals that he has solved the mystery by examining Tim&#x27;s cut up playing cards. It was actually Sylvie who killed her parents because her father had raped her repeatedly and was trying to do the same to Tim, and her mother was aware of the abuse and stayed silent the entire time. Sylvie tearfully tries to kill Jake again to stop other people from learning about her secret, but is persuaded not to do so by Tim who speaks with his own voice for the first time.

Jake, his wife Karen, and Tim go out for trick-or-treating on Halloween. Tim has gradually improved and now can speak in his own voice as well as smile. Jake&#x27;s conversation with his wife reveals that Sylvie will be moved to a mental hospital with minimum security in the near future.

==Cast==
==Production==
Akiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay under the title of &quot;Indian Summer&quot; which was acquired by Morgan Creek Entertainment for $500,000 in February 1991. In August 1993, it was announced Richard Dreyfuss had signed on to star in the film. In September 1993, it was reported that Dreyfuss had missed the first day of filming as he was invited by the White House to attend the signing of the Oslo I Accord.

To prepare for his role, Ben Faulkner visited and observed autistic children at the Linwood Center in Ellicott City, Maryland. Faulkner claims he was unaware of what autism was prior to the making of the film.

A majority of the film was shot in and around Baltimore.

==Release==
===Box office===
Produced on a budget of $30 million, the film grossed $3,180,674 in the United States and Canada. It opened on 1,251 screens with an opening weekend gross of $1.5 million and finishing in tenth place at the US box office but by its third weekend it was only on 256 screens and its gross had reduced by 90% to finish 40th. It dropped a further 93% by its fourth weekend, finishing 74th.

===Critical response===
&quot;Silent Fall&quot; received largely negative reviews from critics, as it holds a 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews.

Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; deemed it &quot;a so-so thriller with a first-rate atmosphere. Director Bruce Beresford is working from a by-the-book script by Akiva Goldsman that piles up the preposterousness. As a murder mystery it’s schematic and too easy to figure out.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4, similarly criticizing the film for its &quot;torturously constructed plot... the solution to the mystery has been right there all along.&quot;

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the screenplay and dialogue, noting that the actors &quot;do the best they can&quot;, adding that the film &quot;takes a lurid turn that includes enough fodder for several tabloid television shows and a few Stephen King novels. Using autism as a plot device may seem callous, but it pales next to the sordid twists that turn up at the end.&quot;

<text>Point Air was a French airline company operating a Douglas DC-8-63 on a route from Marseille and Mulhouse/Basel to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

Point Air was famous for its low prices, before the age of low-cost airlines.

The airline started operations in 1980. Built on the remains of the French Antillan SATT, the Swiss-registered Point Air went into a politically enforced bankruptcy in 1988.

<doc id="1055940" wikidata="Q5156533" url="?curid=1055940" title="Completely multiplicative function">
<text>In number theory, functions of positive integers which respect products are important and are called completely multiplicative functions or totally multiplicative functions. A weaker condition is also important, respecting only products of coprime numbers, and such functions are called multiplicative functions. Outside of number theory, the term &quot;multiplicative function&quot; is often taken to be synonymous with &quot;completely multiplicative function&quot; as defined in this article.

==Definition==
A completely multiplicative function (or totally multiplicative function) is an arithmetic function (that is, a function whose domain is the natural numbers), such that &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1 and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;ab&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)&quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) holds &quot;for all&quot; positive integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

In logic notation: formula_1 and formula_2.

Without the requirement that &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1, one could still have &quot;f&quot;(1) = 0, but then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 0 for all positive integers &quot;a&quot;, so this is not a very strong restriction. If one did not fix formula_1, one can see that both formula_4 and formula_5 are possibilities for the value of formula_6 in the following way:
formula_7

The definition above can be rephrased using the language of algebra: A completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism from the monoid formula_8 (that is, the positive integers under multiplication) to some other monoid.

==Examples==
The easiest example of a completely multiplicative function is a monomial with leading coefficient 1: For any particular positive integer &quot;n&quot;, define &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;bc&quot;) = (&quot;bc&quot;)&quot;n&quot; = &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)&quot;f&quot;(&quot;c&quot;), and &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1&quot;n&quot; = 1.

The Liouville function is a non-trivial example of a completely multiplicative function as are Dirichlet characters, the Jacobi symbol and the Legendre symbol.

==Properties==
A completely multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the prime numbers, a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Thus, if &quot;n&quot; is a product of powers of distinct primes, say &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;q&quot;&quot;b&quot; ..., then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)&quot;a&quot; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;q&quot;)&quot;b&quot; ...

While the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is multiplicative, the Dirichlet convolution of two completely multiplicative functions need not be completely multiplicative. Arithmetic functions which can be written as the Dirichlet convolution of two completely multiplicative functions are said to be quadratics or specially multiplicative multiplicative functions. They are rational arithmetic functions of order (2, 0) and obey the Busche-Ramanujan identity. 

There are a variety of statements about a function which are equivalent to it being completely multiplicative. For example, if a function &quot;f&quot; is multiplicative then it is completely multiplicative if and only if its Dirichlet inverse is formula_9 where formula_10 is the Möbius function.

Completely multiplicative functions also satisfy a distributive law. If &quot;f&quot; is completely multiplicative then

formula_11

where &quot;*&quot; represents the Dirichlet product and formula_12 represents pointwise multiplication. One consequence of this is that for any completely multiplicative function &quot;f&quot; one has

formula_13

which can be deduced from the above by putting both formula_14, where formula_15 is the constant function.
Here formula_16 is the divisor function.

===Proof of distributive property===

:formula_17

===Dirichlet series===
The L-function of completely (or totally) multiplicative Dirichlet series formula_18 satisfies
:formula_19
which means that the sum all over the natural numbers is equal to the product all over the prime numbers.

<doc id="1055948" wikidata="Q2760339" url="?curid=1055948" title="Buttermere, Wiltshire">
<text>Buttermere is a small village and civil parish on the eastern boundary of Wiltshire, England, about south of Hungerford and southeast of Marlborough. The village stands above the steep escarpment of Ham Hill, and at above sea level it is the highest village in Wiltshire and probably the highest in Wessex.

The parish includes the hamlet of Henley, southwest of Buttermere village and next to the county border with Hampshire, and the western flanks of Inkpen Hill.

==Toponymy==
A settlement at Buttermere is recorded in the 930s as &quot;Butermere&quot;, and as &quot;Butremare&quot; in Domesday Book. The name is thought to derive from and is generally agreed to mean &quot;lake with good pasture&quot;.

== History ==

The manor of Buttermere was recorded in the 9th century, and from the 11th was held by St Swithun&#x27;s priory, Winchester. Henley&#x27;s land was probably added to the parish in the 11th century, when it was also held by St Swithun&#x27;s. The parish was part of Savernake forest until 1330.

The population of the parish was steady at around 130 for the whole of the 19th century but declined in the 20th, reaching 39 in 1971.

A small school was built near the rectory in 1872, and closed in 1944 when there were only nine pupils.

== Parish church ==
The Church of England parish church of St James is one of the smallest in Wiltshire. There was a church here in the 13th century, and a watercolour by John Buckler in 1806 shows a simple building with a wooden west turret. In 1855-6 the church was rebuilt on the same footprint, using salvaged materials, with a small central spire.

The church is in the parish of Ham and Buttermere, which is part of the Savernake team ministry.

==Local government==
Buttermere civil parish is governed by a parish meeting, a form of governance applied to parishes with a small population. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

<doc id="1055955" wikidata="Q5638833" url="?curid=1055955" title="Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization">
<text>Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496 (1939), is a US labor law case decided by the United States Supreme Court.

==Facts==
In Jersey City, New Jersey, Mayor Frank Hague had in 1937 used a city ordinance to prevent labor meetings in public places and stop the distribution of literature pertaining to the Committee for Industrial Organization&#x27;s cause. He referred to the CIO as &quot;communist.&quot;

“Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens” (Justice Roberts).

==Judgment==
District and circuit courts ruled in favor of the CIO, which brought the suit against the mayor for these actions and which was represented by Morris L. Ernst, Spaulding Frazer, Lee Pressman and Benjamin Kaplan. Hague appealed to the Supreme Court which ruled against him and held that Hague&#x27;s ban on political meetings violated the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly, and so the ordinances were void.

This case brought forth the public forum to the Supreme Court, and is used as a tool for many other cases dealing with First Amendment Rights/ public forum issues. It took a long time after the 14th Amendment was adopted (1866) and ratified (1868) before the Supreme Court began to use it to assert individual rights against State and local Governments; which amplified the right to peacefully assemble and fight for freedom of speech.

<text>DragonRaid is a Christian discipleship learning game set in a fantasy world. DragonRaid was created by Dick Wulf in 1984 and revived in 2018 by Lightraider Academy (Lightraider Christian Fantasy) under Christian author James R. Hannibal. It is generally considered a role-playing game, although the game&#x27;s owners describe it as a hybrid using elements of a role playing game and elements of a choose-your-adventure-style Bible study. Its primary focus is to help Christians understand and nurture the fruit of the Spirit and grow in their understanding of the Bible and its daily application.

== Description ==
Using an allegorical fantasy RPG setting, players are able to play the roles of Keledan (Twiceborn) Lightraiders and practice biblical principles in a group setting. The fantasy backdrop (called Dastan or EdenAgain) is similar to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Arda and C. S. Lewis&#x27; Narnia.

It uses a mechanical system called the Adventure Learning System, and is the only role-playing game to use that system. In the ALS system, the rule set used by the game master (called the &quot;Adventure Master&quot;) to operate the environment and non-player characters is significantly different from the rule set used by the players to operate their personal characters. In particular, enemies roll a smaller die than the players (d8 versus d10), making it more likely that PCs will succeed in their actions than their antagonists. This also has the effect of making random failure more likely for NPCs than for PCs, as the lowest value on an eight-sided die comes up 12.5% of the time, compared to 10% of the time for a ten-sided die. This advantage to players allows the Adventure Master to more easily teach the specific biblical principles that are the focus of each adventure.

The ludic experience is included in a pastoral or religious education frame. The Adventure Master is intended to be a figure of authority (dad/mom, youth leader, Bible study group leader). The game design introduced different resolution rules for the player characters and for the non-player characters.

==Reception==
In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;The most curious thing about &quot;DragonRaid&quot; is what amounts to the magic system, which is based on the idea of Word Runes, essentially Bible quotes that must be recited from memory to, well, create magical effects ... it is an extremely early example of the dialogue-as-mechanic ideas that would crop up in storytelling games and more narrative-based RPGs years later.&quot; However, Horvath pointed out, &quot;&quot;DragonRaid&quot; was a failure ... Entrenched RPG players resented the game&#x27;s blatant fundamentalist Christian themes ... and evangelical Christians thought it was misguided and ultimately just as evil as all the other role-playing games.&quot;

==Criticisms==
The game has been criticized by secular role-players (for its overtly proselytizing content), and by Christian anti-role-playing groups like Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons. The website christiangaming.com similarly states that &quot;DragonRaid became a victim of some well-meaning but mistaken Christian organizations that condemned it as having evil content&quot;.

== Revival of DragonRaid and Lightraider Academy ==
In 2018, Dick Wulf transferred DragonRaid to Christian author and game developer James R. Hannibal. Under the flags of Lightraider Academy and Lightraider Christian fantasy, new games and books, including new adventures for the original DragonRaid, are in development.

== Publications ==

=== DragonRaid ===

* The Lightraider Test, 1984
* The Rescue of the Sacred Scrolls, 1984
* The Moonbridge Raid Part One, 1986
** The Moonbridge Raid campaign initiated a new style of map-based game play for DragonRaid. With the new style, players had more freedom of movement using a hexagon grid map. Adventure Masters led the story based on sector descriptions, with certain critical sectors.
* The Moonbridge Raid Parts Two and Three, 2020
** Under James R. Hannibal, Lightraider Academy published the final two parts of the Moonbridge Raid to complete the campaign. These were produced in a visual style to match the original Moonbridge Raid Part One. The Moonbridge Raid Parts Two and Three continue the map-based play style initiated with Part One. They also add an &quot;encounter&quot; appendix to each part, allowing Adventure Masters the flexibility to provide additional game content pertinent to the main story line of the campaign and allowing the players to discover additional clues and secrets without being funneled into certain map sectors.

<doc id="1055978" wikidata="Q595431" url="?curid=1055978" title="Great Island">
<text>Great Island () is an island in Cork Harbour, at the mouth of the River Lee and close to the city of Cork, Ireland. The largest town on the island is Cobh (called Queenstown from 1849 to 1920). The island&#x27;s economic and social history has historically been linked to the naval, ship-building, and shipping activities in the town&#x27;s environs.

In the early 21st century, a different marine industry has arisen. Tourism and related services have become a significant part of the local economy, including cruise ships attracted by the Port of Cork berthing facilities on the island. This is the only dedicated cruising ship berth in the Republic of Ireland.

== History ==

The ancient name of the island was &quot;Ard-Neimheadh&quot;, the &quot;High (or important) island of Neimheadh&quot;. According to the 11th-century work Lebor Gabála Érenn, Neimheadh was the leader of a group who invaded the area in prehistoric times. Archaeological evidence of prehistoric and early medieval settlement on Great Island is recorded on the Record of Monuments and Places of the National Monuments Service. This includes records of ringfort, fulacht fiadh, holy well, and bee bole structures.
By the early 13th century, the island was under the control of the Anglo-Norman Hodnett family. The Hodnetts built several structures, including Belvelly Castle, to defend the island and its approaches. The island and its defenses were taken by the de Barra (Barry) family in the 14th century. The Barry family (later Earls of Barrymore) retained power in the area for several centuries, and the island became known as &quot;Barrymore Island&quot; or &quot;Oileán Mór an Bharraigh&quot;, meaning &quot;Great island of the Barrys&quot;.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, due to the strategic importance of the island within Cork Harbour (overlooking the naval berths and military bases at Haulbowline and Spike Island), several coastal defence fortifications were built on Great Island. These included construction by the British of Cove Fort (between Cobh and Cuskinny) in the 18th century and several Martello towers (at Belvelly, Monning and Rossleague) in the 19th century.

The largest settlement on Great Island, Cobh, had significant development during the 19th and early 20th centuries, stimulated by additional expansion in shipping and naval activity in the area.

== Location and access ==

Great Island is located in Cork Harbour on Ireland&#x27;s south coast, and is made-up of the civil parishes of Clonmel and Templerobin.

The island is connected by road bridge to Fota Island to the north – which, in turn, connects via a causeway to the mainland. This road bridge, Belvelly Bridge, was built in 1803 at one of the narrowest points in the channels around Great Island. More than 200 years old, it is the only road bridge to the island.

A railway bridge and rail line also runs out through Fota Island to Great Island. Railway stations on Great Island include Carrigaloe station and Rushbrooke station, and the terminus at Cobh. A ferry service also connects the island (from a point near Carrigaloe) to the mainland (at a point near Passage West).

During regional windstorms in 2017 (including Storm Ophelia), downed trees and high winds resulted in the closure of the only road bridge to Great Island. Ferry and rail services were cancelled, leaving 12,000 residents stranded on the island. This led to some calls for a review of emergency access provisions and plans for the island.

==Land use and economy==
In the 19th century &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (published by Samuel Lewis in 1837), Great Island is described as &quot;very fertile&quot; with its &quot;light productive soil&quot; supporting agricultural uses with &quot;two-thirds [of the island] under tillage, and the remainder in pasture or included in demesnes&quot;. Lewis describes the island&#x27;s location, environment and climate as factors &quot;induc[ing] many genteel families to settle here&quot;.

As of the 21st century, land use on Great Island remains primarily agricultural and residential in nature. The island has a population of between 12,000 and 14,000. While some of this population work on the island, as of the early 21st century, an increasing percentage of the island&#x27;s residents commute to Cork city for work, traveling by car, Cork Commuter Rail, and bus services to the city. Residential developments are concentrated mainly around Cobh, with other populated townlands and settlements on the island including Ballymore, Ballynoe, and Belvelly.

Prior to the 21st century, land use included industrial zones, such as the former Irish Fertilizer Industries plant at Marino Point, and the Verolme Cork Dockyard at Rushbrooke. The latter was long the site of construction of vessels for the Irish Naval Service, such as the LÉ &quot;Eithne&quot;. Many of these heavy industries have since closed. Some smaller boatbuilding companies are still based at Cobh.

Tourism is now important to the island economy. As of 2017, Great Island was the location of the only berth in the Republic of Ireland dedicated for visiting cruise ships. This industry has grown in the 21st century.

==Ecology==

Several proposed conservation sites and green areas are located on and around the island. These include Cuskinny Marsh Nature Reserve (which is managed by BirdWatch Ireland), Marlogue Wood (operated by Coillte), and the Great Island Channel Special Area of Conservation (overseen by the National Parks and Wildlife Service). The latter, the Great Island Special Area of Conservation, proposes conservation controls (including aquaculture limits) to protect the animal and bird habitats of the area&#x27;s salt marshes.

While larger fish species are less common in the Great Island Special Area of Conservation, a large blue shark was recorded just off the island in mid-2018.

<doc id="1055979" wikidata="Q1354294" url="?curid=1055979" title="Trojan (brand)">
<text>Trojan is a brand name of condoms and sexual lubricants manufactured by the Church &amp; Dwight Company. Trojan condoms were started by Merle Leland Youngs in the 1910s after he moved to New York City. The major condom manufacturer before Youngs was Julius Schmid, who had made condoms from animal intestines starting in the 1880s.

As of 2006, 70.5% of condoms purchased in United States drugstores are Trojan brand.

== Brand history ==

Trojan condoms were first manufactured in 1916 by Merle Leland Youngs through his company Fay and Youngs, renamed Youngs Rubber Corporation in 1919. Youngs Rubber Corporation debuted Trojan brand condoms with the image of the Trojan helmet. Trojan began advertising condoms in 1927 through an ad placed in a trade magazine for pharmacists.

By 1930 latex-based materials were used. Latex was less expensive than the rubber used previously, while still providing protection against disease and pregnancy. The material change also allowed a shelf life of five years in comparison to three months. As of 2009, Trojan produces 30 different varieties of condoms.

Unlike other brands, Trojan manufactures some of its condoms in the United States. Church and Dwight has a factory located at 1851 Touchstone Dr, South Chesterfield, VA. The facility was built in 1988 by the Safetex Corp. to manufacture Saxon condoms. In the mid-1990s, Trojan, then owned by Carter-Wallace, sought a new manufacturing facility. Safetex announced the closure of its Chesterfield factory. Carter-Wallace purchased and modernized the factory in 1995, expanding it to more than three times its original size.

In May of 2023, Church and Dwight announced a $27-million expansion to its Chesterfield manufacturing plant, where they plan to produce an innovative scent-boosting laundry product.

== Research ==

Since 2006, Trojan has conducted the Sexual Health Report Card, an annual ranking of the sexual health resources available to students at college and university campuses throughout the United States. Student health centers at 141 schools from the various Bowl Championship Series conferences are ranked on the students&#x27; opinion of subjects such as their health center, condom and other contraceptive availability, HIV and STD testing, student peer groups, sexual assault programs and resources, and website usability. Research firm Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces collates and analyzes the data. During the last report in 2016, University of Georgia ranked among the best, with St. John&#x27;s University in last place. The results caused a great deal of controversy. School administrators insisted that students must adhere to Roman Catholic teachings, which emphasize Natural family planning.

== Notable marketing campaigns ==

In 2003, in order to introduce Trojan condoms in the United Kingdom, a humorous fake official web site for the so-called Trojan Games was created. The Trojan Games were supposedly an international sporting event similar to the Olympics and taking place in Bucharest. The sports were based on sexual performance. As of November 2006 the various &quot;Trojan Games&quot; videos had been viewed 300 million times.

Trojan Vibrations gave away a total of 7,000 free vibrators in New York City and Washington, DC, in 2012.

By August 2018 a new ad campaign called &quot;Big Sexy World&quot; introduced a new mascot, the Trojan Man. This stirred up controversy. Many people received the ads as &quot;too inappropriate&quot;.

A podcast hosted by Cody Ko called &quot;The Pleasure Is Ours&quot; – sponsored by Trojan and produced by iHeartRadio premiered on October 1, 2020, featuring YouTuber Drew Gooden. In each episode, Ko &quot;invites a special guest on board to act as the older brothers (or sister) you never had, picking apart the dumbest notions that a young man or woman might be exposed to as they come of age, with topics ranging from work, to sex, to entertainment, to social media,&quot; and features ads exclusive to Trojan Brand products.

<doc id="1055980" wikidata="Q2599946" url="?curid=1055980" title="Year and a day rule">
<text>The year and a day rule is associated with the former common law standard that death could not be legally attributed to acts or omissions that occurred more than a year and a day before the death.

It is elsewhere associated with the minimum sentence for a crime to count as a felony.

==The rule and homicide==
In English common law, it was held that a death was conclusively presumed not to be murder (or any other homicide) if it occurred more than a year and one day since the act (or omission) that was alleged to have been its cause. The rule also applied to the offence of assisting with a suicide.

Certain problems with this rule arise from the advance of medicine. Life support technology can extend the interval between the murderous act and the subsequent death. Application of the year and a day rule prevented murder prosecutions, not because of the merits of the case, but because of the successful intervention of doctors in prolonging life. Additionally, advances in forensic medicine may assist the court to determine that an act was a cause of death even though it was carried out fairly far in the past.

=== England and Wales, Northern Ireland ===
The rule was abolished by the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996. English and Welsh law and Northern Irish law is now substantially revised such that if a specific action can be proved to be the cause of death, it can now potentially constitute murder regardless of the intervening time. The abolition of the rule does not relieve the prosecution of its obligation to prove the &quot;mens rea&quot; element; in cases of murder, this is the accused intended to cause either death or serious injury.

The permission of the Attorney General for England and Wales or Attorney General for Northern Ireland is required for any prosecution in which it is alleged that the death occurred more than three years after the causative act, or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand had a year and a day rule until it was abolished unanimously in March 2018.

===United States===
*In 1891, the rule was upheld at the federal level in &quot;United States v. Ball&quot;.
*In 1987, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the highest local court in Washington, DC, rejected the year-and-a-day-rule in &quot;United States v. Jackson&quot;.
*In 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a Tennessee court&#x27;s retroactive abolition of the rule was constitutional in &quot;Rogers v. Tennessee,&quot; since the &quot;ex post facto&quot; clause only prohibits an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law from being passed, but does not prohibit a judicial organ from revising the common law in an &quot;ex post facto&quot; manner.

The rule&#x27;s common law status has been successfully used by defendants to overturn convictions as recently as 2003: the Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld the year and a day rule in the case before it, but simultaneously abolished the rule for any later cases, noting the modern circumstances of homicide cases, in which there is &quot;the specter of a family&#x27;s being forced to choose between terminating the use of a life-support system and allowing an accused to escape a murder charge&quot; and the court&#x27;s finding that it is &quot;unjust to permit an assailant to escape punishment because of a convergence of modern medical advances and an archaic rule from the thirteenth century&quot;.

In California, the &quot;year and a day&quot; rule has been changed to a &quot;three years and a day&quot; rule. If a death occurs more than three years and one day after the act alleged to have caused it (and the act was committed on or after 1 January 1997), there is &quot;a rebuttable presumption that the killing was not criminal&quot;, but the prosecution may seek to overcome this presumption. However, if the murder is committed by somebody who is serving a term of life imprisonment and is sentenced to state prison the year and a day rule applies instead.

In 2014, the D.C. rule (as it existed in 1981) was one of the reasons given for why John Hinckley, the attempted assassin of President Ronald Reagan, could not be prosecuted for the murder of James S. Brady. The medical examiner listed the cause of death for Brady as bullets fired 33 years earlier.

=== Hong Kong ===
The rule was abolished in 2000 by section 33C of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212).

== Where the rule is not applied to homicide ==

=== Jurisdictions where the rule has never applied ===
The following countries are listed in the &quot;Report on the Year and a Day Rule in Homicide&quot; with the observation that &quot;the rule has never applied&quot;:
* Austria
* France
* Germany
* Greece
* Italy
* Poland
* Scotland
*: The report also said &quot;It was held in H.M. Advocate v Stewart that the Crown may be barred from proceeding with a trial if it would be oppressive for them to do so in view of the passage of time since the discovery of the offence.&quot;
* South Africa

=== Jurisdictions where the rule has been abolished ===
* England and Wales, Northern Ireland
*: See the main introduction above.
* Republic of Ireland
*: The rule was abolished &quot;for all purposes&quot; including &quot;for the purposes of offences involving the death of a person, and for the purpose of determining whether a person committed suicide&quot; by the section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.
* Hong Kong
*: The rule was abolished &quot;for all purposes&quot; in Hong Kong by section 33C of the Offences Against the Person Ordinance, which is added by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance 2000 following the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong. The Commission did not consider it necessary to set a time limit beyond which prosecutions required the consent of the Secretary of Justice.

==As a sentence for felons==
A year and a day is a minimum incarceration sentence for felonies in many jurisdictions, and is one of the main features distinguishing felonies from misdemeanors. For some crimes, this is the minimum penalty, as traditionally in English-speaking, common law countries, misdemeanors may not entail a sentence of more than a year, whereas felonies are traditionally punished by incarceration of over one year, hence &quot;a year and a day.&quot; Furthermore, in many jurisdictions, prisoners are eligible for parole only if their sentences are longer than a year; by imposing a sentence of a year and a day, judges can offer defendants a chance at parole. In the United States federal system, only sentences exceeding one year allow prisoners to obtain early release for good behaviour while incarcerated. As a result, a sentence of a year and a day can lead to less time served than a sentence of a year.

<doc id="1055983" wikidata="Q7883241" url="?curid=1055983" title="Under the Banner of Heaven">
<text>Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith is a nonfiction book by author Jon Krakauer, first published in July 2003. He investigated and juxtaposed two histories: the origin and evolution of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and a modern double murder committed in the name of God by brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who subscribed to a fundamentalist version of Mormonism.

The Laffertys were formerly members of a very small splinter group called the School of Prophets, led by Robert C. Crossfield (also known by his prophet name Onias). The group accepts many beliefs of the original LDS church at the time when it ceased the practice of polygamy in the 1890s, but it does not identify with those who call themselves fundamentalist Mormons. The book examines the ideologies of both the LDS Church and the fundamentalist Mormon polygamous groups, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church).

The book was adapted as a limited series of the same name that began airing in April 2022 on FX on Hulu.

== Synopsis ==

===Murders===
The book opens with news accounts of the 1984 murder of Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter Erica. Brenda was married to Allen Lafferty, the youngest of the Lafferty brothers. His older brothers Dan and Ron disapproved of their sister-in-law Brenda because they believed she was the reason Dan&#x27;s wife left him (after refusing to allow him to marry a plural/second wife—his stepdaughters). Both men&#x27;s extremism reached new heights when they became members of the School of the Prophets, founded and led by Robert C. Crossfield. After joining this group, Ron claimed that God had sent him revelations about Brenda. Communication with God is a core belief of fundamentalist Mormonism, as well as the mainstream LDS Church. Ron showed the members of the School of Prophets a written &quot;removal revelation&quot; that allegedly called for the killing of Brenda and her baby. After other members of the School failed to honor Ron&#x27;s removal revelation, the brothers quit the School.

Dan claimed that he slit both of the victims&#x27; throats. But, at the 2001 trial, Chip Carnes, who was riding in the getaway car, testified that Ron said that he had killed Brenda, and that Ron had thanked his brother for &quot;doing the baby&quot;.

After the murders, the police found the written &quot;revelation&quot; concerning Brenda and Erica. The press widely reported that Ron had received a revelation to kill the mother and child. Afterward, the Lafferty brothers conducted a recorded press conference at which Ron said that the &quot;revelation&quot; was not addressed to him, but to &quot;Todd&quot; [a drifter whom Ron had befriended while working in Wichita] and that the revelation called only for &quot;removal&quot; of Brenda and her baby, and did not use the word &quot;kill&quot;. The jury at Ron&#x27;s trial was shown these remarks of Ron denying he had received a revelation to kill Brenda and Erica.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints history===
After opening with the Lafferty case, Krakauer explores the history of Mormonism, starting with the early life of Joseph Smith, founder and first prophet of the Latter Day Saint movement. He follows his life from a criminal fraud trial to leading the first followers to Jackson County, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Illinois. While violence seemed to accompany the Mormons, Krakauer notes that they did not necessarily initiate it. Early Mormons faced religious persecution from mainstream Protestant Christians, due to their unorthodox beliefs, including polygamy and ongoing revelation from God through living prophets. In addition they tended to conduct business and personal relations only with other members of their community. There were violent clashes between Mormons and non-Mormons, culminating in Smith&#x27;s death on June 27, 1844, when a mob shot him after attacking him in Carthage Jail, where he was awaiting trial for inciting a riot after ordering, as Nauvoo&#x27;s mayor, in conjunction with the City Council, the destruction of the printing press of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, a local publication which had been declared a public nuisance.

From Nauvoo, the Mormons trekked westward to modern-day Utah, led by Smith&#x27;s successor Brigham Young (after some controversy). Arriving in what they called Deseret, many Mormons believed they would be left alone by the United States government, as the territory was then part of Mexico. Soon after their arrival, the Mexican–American War occurred, with Mexico&#x27;s eventual defeat. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo signed on February 2, 1848, this land and the rest of what would become the American Southwest were ceded to the United States.

Smith&#x27;s highly controversial revelation of plural marriage threatened to split apart followers of the faith. The Utah Territory was a theodemocracy led by Brigham Young as Governor, where polygamy continued to be practiced for 43 years. Finally, on September 23, 1890, Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Church, claimed to have received a revelation from God (known as the 1890 Manifesto) which officially banned polygamy. Six years later, Utah was granted statehood.

After the Manifesto, some members broke away from the mainstream church to form what eventually became the FLDS Church, the most popular group of fundamentalist Mormonism. The FLDS Church continues to encourage polygamy, as do some other breakaway groups.

===Comparisons===
Krakauer examines events in Latter Day Saint history and compares them to modern-day FLDS doctrine (and other minority versions of Mormonism, such as the Crossfield School of the Prophets). He examines the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre during the Utah War, in which Mormons and some local Paiute Indians rounded up and murdered approximately 120 members of the Baker–Fancher party of emigrants passing through their territory. These early Mormons went to great lengths to conceal their part in the massacre (including dressing as the Paiute and painting their faces in similar fashion). The Civil War interrupted investigations of the events, and no one was indicted until 1874, when nine men were charged. For nearly two decades the falsehood held that the massacre was due solely to the Paiute. The only person ever convicted in the affair was John D. Lee, a former member of the LDS Church. He was convicted and executed by the state in 1877 for his role in the crime.

Krakauer cites information gleaned from several interviews with Dan Lafferty and former and current members of the Crossfield School of the Prophets, as well as other fundamentalist Mormons. He refers to several histories about the formation of Mormonism to tie the origins of the religion to the modern iterations of both the church and the fundamentalists.

==Derivation of the title==
The title of the book is drawn from an 1880 address by John Taylor, the third president of the LDS Church, defending the practice of plural marriage:

God is greater than the United States, and when the Government conflicts with heaven, we will be ranged under the banner of heaven against the Government. The United States says we cannot marry more than one wife. God says different.

==Reception==
Charles Graeber of &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed the book in his top ten true crime books, and described Krakauer as &quot;a master journalist and storyteller who is unfettered and unafraid of the true crime mantle. [He] pries open the golden doors to one of the newest and fastest-growing religions in America to set the stage for the non-fiction drama.&quot;

In advance of the book&#x27;s release in 2003, Richard E. Turley, managing director of the Church History Department of the LDS Church, argued that the book contained historical errors and incorrect assertions, and showed &quot;unfamiliarity with basic aspects&quot; of the Church&#x27;s history, theology and administrative structure, and criticized the work for lacking a &quot;scientific methodology&quot;. He accused Krakauer of &quot;condemn[ing] religion generally&quot;. In his 2004 paperback edition of the book, Krakauer responded to these allegations, noting that Turley&#x27;s pre-emptive &quot;response&quot; preceded the book&#x27;s release, and claimed that LDS leaders had explicitly advocated the whitewashing of LDS history, amongst other points.

Mike Otterson, managing director of public affairs for the LDS Church, condemned Krakauer&#x27;s example of religious &quot;zealots&quot; to draw conclusions about all Mormons and any propensity for violence. Otterson said that, after reading the book, &quot;One could be forgiven for concluding that every Latter-day Saint, including your friendly Mormon neighbor, has a tendency to violence. And so Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist.&quot;

==Television adaptation ==

In July 2011, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the book, with Ron Howard directing and Dustin Lance Black writing the screenplay. In June 2021, it was announced that the book was being redeveloped as a limited series for FX, with Black still attached as writer, David Mackenzie serving as director, and Andrew Garfield, Gil Birmingham and Daisy Edgar-Jones to star. The series debuted in April 2022 on FX on Hulu.

==Related documentary==
In 2015, Amy Berg released her independent documentary, &quot;Prophet&#x27;s Prey&quot;, about fundamentalist Mormons practicing polygamy, based on the case of Warren Jeffs, sentenced to life for polygamy and abuse of minors. Krakauer participated in this film and appears on camera, as he continued his own investigation of sects that practiced polygamy. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, both working on the television adaptation of the book as producers, were also executive producers of the documentary.

<text> (SS-VT, ) was formed in 1934 as combat troops for the Nazi Party (NSDAP). On 17 August 1938 Adolf Hitler decreed that the SS-VT was neither a part of the (order police) nor the , but military-trained men at the disposal of the . In time of war, the SS-VT were to be placed at the disposal of the army.

The SS-VT were involved in the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. By 1940 these military SS units had become the nucleus of the .

==Formation==

The SS-VT was formed on 24 September 1934 from a merger of various Nazi and paramilitary formations such as the SS Special Detachments (&quot;SS-Sonderkommandos&quot;) and the Headquarters Guard (&quot;SS-Stabswache&quot;) units. The SS-VT consisted of three regiments, modelled on the infantry regiments of the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) and regulations; each regiment consisting of three infantry battalions, a motorcycle company and a mortar company. The unit was officially designated &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (&quot;Dispositional troops&quot;, i.e. troops at the personal disposal of the Führer). The men were to be volunteers who had completed their service in the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (RAD; Reich Labour Service).

The existence of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT) was publicly declared on 16 March 1935 by Hitler in a speech at the Reichstag. The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and the army also retained control of the recruiting system through local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the Wehrmacht to meet quotas set by the German High Command (&quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; or OKW in German). As a consequence, the SS was given the lowest priority for recruits, thereby limiting its size.

In 1936, Himmler selected former Lieutenant General Paul Hausser to be Inspector of the SS-VT with the rank of &quot;Brigadefuhrer&quot;. Hausser worked to transform the SS-VT into a credible military force that was a match for the regular army. The SS-VT trained alongside Hitler&#x27;s personal bodyguard, the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH), which had also been formed from the &quot;SS-Stabswache&quot; and &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Berlin&quot;. The LSSAH, under the command of Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich, continued to serve exclusively as a personal protection unit for Hitler and an honor guard during this timeframe.

By 1937 the SS was divided into three branches: the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; (General SS), the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT), and the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV) which administered the concentration camps. On 17 August 1938 Hitler decreed that the SS military formations were to be placed at the &quot;disposal&quot; of the army in time of war. Hitler stated, at Himmler&#x27;s request, that service in the SS-VT qualified to fulfill military service obligations. Further, during wartime, units of the SS-TV would be used as reserves for the SS-VT. Over the course of the war this led to a constant flux of men between the Waffen-SS and the Nazi concentration camps.

The military formations under Himmler&#x27;s command on 1 September 1939 consisted of several subgroups:
* Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard unit, the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH) under Sepp Dietrich.
* The Inspectorate of &quot;Verfügungstruppe&quot; under Paul Hausser, which commanded the &quot;Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Germania&quot; and &quot;Der Führer&quot; regiments.
*The Concentration Camps Inspectorate (&quot;Inspektion der Konzentrationslager&quot;) under Theodor Eicke, which fielded four militarized Death&#x27;s-Head &quot;Standarten&quot;, comprising camp guards of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände.&quot; The &quot;SS-Totenkopf&quot; Division was initially formed from concentration camp guards of the &quot;Standarten&quot; (regiments) of the SS-TV and the &quot;SS Heimwehr Danzig&quot; in October 1939. It was then folded into the Waffen-SS in August 1940. These troops wore the SS-TV skull and crossbones rather than the SS-VT &quot;SS&quot; runes.
*There were in addition combat-trained non-SS police units of &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Kurt Daluege&#x27;s &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;, which reported to Himmler in his capacity as Chief of German Police. For the 1940 campaigns these also would be formed into a division, which would be placed under Waffen-SS control in January 1941 and merged into it in February 1942.

==Early operations==

Elements of the SS-VT served with the Wehrmacht during the occupation of the Sudetenland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. For those operations, the SS-VT was under the command of the army. The SS-VT also formed an Artillery Regiment during this time-frame which was used to fill the gaps in a number of army units for those events. The SS-VT regiments &quot;Deutschland&quot; and &quot;Germania&quot; along with the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; participated in the invasion of Poland, with &quot;Der Führer&quot; (recruited in Austria after the Anschluss) in reserve at Prague. In September 1939, a combined unit of SS-VT and Heer (army) troops conducted operations jointly as Panzer Division &quot;Kempf&quot; during the invasion of Poland. It fought alongside army units at Rozan, Modlin, Łomża and Kmiczyn. The division was disbanded near the Polish city of Nidzica on 7 October 1939.

In spite of the swift military victory over Poland in September 1939, events during the invasion of Poland raised doubts over the combat effectiveness of the SS-VT. The OKW or &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (High Command of the Armed Forces) reported that the SS-VT units took unnecessary risks and had a higher casualty rate than the army. They also stated that the SS-VT was poorly trained and its officers unsuitable for combat command. As an example, OKW noted that the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; had to be rescued by an army regiment after becoming surrounded at Pabianice by the Poles. In its defence, the SS insisted that it had been hampered by having to fight piecemeal instead of as one formation, and was improperly equipped by the army to carry out its objectives. Himmler insisted that the SS-VT should be allowed to fight in its own formations under its own commanders, while the OKW tried to have the SS-VT disbanded altogether. Hitler was unwilling to upset either the army or Himmler, and chose a third path. He ordered that the SS-VT form its own divisions but that the divisions would be under army command.

In addition, Eicke&#x27;s SS-TV field forces were not military, and during the invasion of Poland, &quot;[t]heir...capabilities were employed instead in terrorizing the civilian population through acts that included hunting down straggling Polish soldiers, confiscating agricultural produce and livestock, and torturing and murdering large numbers of Polish political leaders, aristocrats, businessmen, priests, intellectuals, and Jews.&quot; Further, members of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; also committed atrocities in numerous towns, including the murder of 50 Polish Jews in Błonie and the massacre in Złoczew, where 200 civilians were machine gunned. Złoczew&#x27;s children also suffered; SS men beat and murdered them, sometimes with rifle butts, crushing the skulls of toddlers. Shootings also took place in Bolesławiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mława, and Włocławek.

==Development of the Waffen-SS==
In October 1939 the SS-VT regiments &quot;Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Germania&quot;, and &quot;Der Führer&quot; were organized into the &quot;SS-Verfügungs-Division&quot; with Paul Hausser as commander. The LSSAH was expanded into a motorized regiment.

In addition, the armed but ill-trained &quot;Totenkopfstandarten&quot;, together with &quot;SS Heimwehr Danzig&quot;, were organized into the &quot;Totenkopf-Division&quot; under Eicke&#x27;s command in October 1939. A further division, the &quot;Polizei-Division&quot;, was created from the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;. These formations took part in combat training while under army commands in preparation for Fall Gelb against the Low Countries and France in 1940.

Elements of both the SS-VT and the LSSAH participated in the ground invasion of the Battle of the Netherlands. In the five-day campaign, the LSSAH linked up with army units and airborne troops after a number of clashes with Dutch defenders. After the surrender of Rotterdam, the LSSAH left for The Hague, which they reached on 15 May, after capturing 3,500 Dutch soldiers as prisoners of war.

On 16 May the SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division was ordered to France and was attached to army divisions which formed the northern &quot;spearhead&quot; of attack. In France, the SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; was involved in the only Allied tank attack in the Battle of France. On 21 May units of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade, supported by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, took part in the Battle of Arras. The SS &quot;Totenkopf&quot; was overrun, finding their standard anti-tank gun, the 3.7 cm PaK 36, no match for the British Matilda tank.

After the Dutch surrender, the LSSAH was moved south to France. On 24 May the LSSAH, along with the SS-VT division, were positioned to hold the perimeter around Dunkirk, assisting in reduction of the size of the pocket containing the encircled British Expeditionary Force and French forces. On 27 May, a unit from the &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, the 4 Company, committed the Le Paradis massacre; 97 captured men of the 2nd Battalion Royal Norfolk Regiment were machine gunned after surrendering, with survivors finished off with bayonets. Two men survived. By 28 May the &quot;SS-Leibstandarte&quot; had taken the village of Wormhout, from Dunkirk. There, soldiers of the 2nd Battalion were responsible for the Wormhoudt massacre, where 80 British and French soldiers were murdered after they surrendered.

After the close of the Battle of France, the SS-VT was officially renamed the Waffen-SS, in a speech made by Adolf Hitler on 19 July 1940. Himmler also gained approval for the Waffen-SS to form its own high command, the &quot;Kommandoamt der Waffen-SS&quot; (Waffen-SS Command Office) within the &quot;SS-Führungshauptamt&quot; (FHA), which was created in August 1940 under &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Hans Jüttner. The &quot;Totenkopf&quot; Division, together with the independent &quot;Totenkopf-Standarten&quot;, were transferred to FHA control. Further that same month, SS chief-of-staff Gottlob Berger approached Himmler with a plan to recruit volunteers in the conquered territories from the ethnic German and Germanic populations. At first Hitler had doubts about recruiting foreigners, but he was persuaded by Himmler and Berger. He gave approval for a new division to be formed from foreign nationals with German officers.
In December 1940 the &quot;Germania&quot; Regiment was removed from the &quot;Verfügungs&quot;-Division and used to form the cadre of a new division, SS-Division &quot;Germania&quot;. It was made up of mostly &quot;Nordic&quot; volunteers from the newly conquered territories, Danes, Norwegians, Dutch and Flemings. By the start of 1941, &quot;Germania&quot; was renamed &quot;Wiking&quot;, with command given to then &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Felix Steiner, the former commander of the SS-VT regiment &quot;Deutschland&quot;. The &quot;Verfügungs-Division&quot; was also renamed &quot;Reich&quot; (in 1942 &quot;Das Reich&quot;). In addition, the &quot;Polizei&quot; division was brought under Waffen-SS administration. The &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; was also expanded to a division for Operation Barbarossa.

When the Waffen-SS divisions were assigned numbers much later in the war these first formations, &quot;Leibstandarte, Das Reich, Totenkopf, Polizei&quot; and &quot;Wiking&quot;, were recognized as SS divisions 1 through 5.

<text>H.K. Porter, Inc. (Porter) manufactured light-duty railroad locomotives in the US, starting in 1866. The company became the largest producer of industrial locomotives, and built almost eight thousand of them. The last locomotive was built in 1950, but the company continues to produce industrial equipment to this day.

Porter was known for building locomotives for industrial railways, which were often small enough that they could be operated by one person. Porter built mostly steam locomotives, but also some gas- and diesel- engined locomotives, and some that ran on compressed air.

==History==

In 1866 Henry Kirke Porter formed a partnership with John Y. Smith, forming the company Smith &amp; Porter. They opened a small machine shop on 28th Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and begin repairing and building industrial equipment. They received an order for their first locomotive on March 4, 1867, and built the &quot;Joshua Rhodes&quot; for the New Castle Railroad and Mining Company. They went on to build 43 locomotives together, including the &quot;Minnetonka&quot; which is preserved at the Lake Superior Museum of Transportation. They specialized in four wheeled, saddle tank locomotives for small industrial railroads.

On February 7, 1871 a fire broke out in the shop destroying twelve locomotives under construction, the shop, and 23 adjacent structures. The losses were estimated at $200,000, and the partnership was dissolved. Smith formed Smith &amp; Dawson Locomotives, which became National Locomotive Works. Porter formed a partnership with Arthur W. Bell, called Porter, Bell &amp; Co. and they built their first locomotive for the Jackson Furnace Co. of Michigan. They expanded their range to include light passenger engines and small freight engines, primarily for narrow gauge railroads. They built 223 locomotives, until Arthur Bell died in May 1878.

Porter continued the business on his own, as H.K. Porter &amp; Co. He had established a reputation as a builder of rugged, specialized locomotives and the company could custom build a locomotive quickly and efficiently, with a system of interchangeable parts; pistons, wheels and boilers in various sizes that can be combined to suit a customer&#x27;s requirements. Some of the basic designs were kept in stock, and could be ordered off the shelf.

In 1890, Porter built their first compressed-air locomotive, for a coal mine in Pennsylvania. Air was stored in two tanks, and used to drive the pistons instead of steam. Coal-fired locomotives were unsuitable for use underground because they produced dangerous fumes and could start fires. Porter went on to build over 400 compressed-air locomotives. Although other manufacturers built compressed-air locomotives, by 1900 Porter had captured 90% of the market.

In 1899, the company was incorporated as H.K. Porter Co., Inc and built a new plant at 49th and Harrison Street in Pittsburgh. Production peaked in 1906, with almost 400 locomotives built that year.

Porter built their first gasoline-powered locomotive in 1906, and in 1915 they built their first fireless locomotive, using a large pressure vessel to hold steam and hot water in place of a boiler. These proved to be more useful than compressed-air locomotives, and soon Porter dominated this niche market.

1919: Porter was selected to build twenty 45-class mainline locomotives for the Manila Railroad Company in the Philippines to replace its aging British tank locomotives. The class weighed and were one of the largest locomotives built by the company. Its efficiency and low cost of maintenance led the Manila Railroad to use the Porter design for larger locomotives built by Alco and Baldwin.

1921: The H.K. Porter Co. was prosperous, enjoying a post-World War I reconstruction boom in Europe, and a road construction boom in the US. Porters were a favorite choice among grading contractors, who used light, portable tracks to carry the wooden tipper-cars that were the earthmoving equipment of the day. Henry Porter, still running the company at age 81, died on April 10.

1939: After a long decline, the H.K. Porter Co. declared bankruptcy. Thomas Mellon Evans purchased the company, determined to turn it around. He bought other manufacturing companies, adding them to his collection. Locomotive production increased again during World War II, and the company was recognized for its service to the country in 1942, but demand for steam locomotives dwindled post-war, and H.K. Porter became primarily a holding company for the many subsidiaries Evans had acquired.

1950: The company built its last locomotive, which was exported to Brazil. The parts business and all the required patterns were sold to the Davenport Locomotive Works in Iowa.

1950s–1960s: Electrical Division National Electric Defense Products Facilities manufactured rocket motor bodies for Nike family of guided missiles.

1969: The company acquired saw manufacturer Shurly &amp; Dietrich, which continued operations until 1973.

<doc id="1055992" wikidata="Q2985386" url="?curid=1055992" title="Editorial board">
<text>The editorial board is a group of editors, writers, and other people who are charged with implementing a publication&#x27;s approach to editorials and other opinion pieces. The editorials published normally represent the views or goals of the publication&#x27;s owner or publisher.

==Mass media==
At a newspaper, the editorial board usually consists of the editor responsible for the editorial page and editorial writers. Some newspapers include other personnel as well. Some editorial writers may also have other roles in the publication. Editorial boards for magazines may include experts in the subject area that the magazine focuses on, and larger magazines may have several editorial boards grouped by subject. An executive editorial board, which usually includes the executive editor and representatives from the subject-focus boards, may oversee these subject boards.

Editorial boards meet regularly to discuss the latest news and opinion trends and to discuss what the publication should say on a range of issues, including current events. They will then decide who will write which editorials and for what day. When such an editorial appears in a newspaper, it is considered the institutional opinion of that newspaper, and the resulting pieces are rarely signed by the individual primarily responsible for writing it. At some newspapers, the editorial board will also review wire service and syndicated columns for inclusion on the editorial page and the op-ed page. Book and magazine publishers will often use their editorial boards to review or select manuscripts or articles, and sometimes to check facts. Book publishers may also make use of editorial boards, using subject experts to select manuscripts. Editorial boards are less common for broadcasters, as typical television news programs rarely include opinion content.

A typical editorial board for a newspaper has three or four employees. In early 2023, the editorial board for The New York Times comprised 14 employees, all from its Opinion department. Some newspapers, particularly small ones, do not have an editorial board, choosing instead to rely on the judgment of a single editorial page editor. 

In the 1700s, if any editorial were published, it had typically written by the owner or was an op-ed. In the 1800s, subscribers wanted to know the opinion of the individual, such as Horace Greeley. In the US, the trend towards unsigned editorials began before 1900, especially at politically conservative newspapers, and when demand surged for signed, analytical content, newspapers turned to syndicated columnists to fill the gap.

The editorial board meeting ran by Phyllis E. Grann at Putnam was called the &quot;Thursday Morning Breakfast Meeting.&quot; The meeting was described in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; as, &quot;8:30 event had a war-room atmosphere, with representatives of every department--editorial, publicity, sales and marketing--reporting in to Grann, who made decisions like a Mike Milken-style bond trader, constantly evaluation and re-evaluating her positions.&quot;

Some editorial boards additionally publish blogs, where they can publish additional information and interact with readers. Early editorial board blogs, such as CBS&#x27;s Public Eye blog, were associated with reporting scandals.

==Academic journals==
Almost all academic journals have an editorial board consisting of selected, unpaid experts in the academic field covered by a journal. This is almost always an honorary position, although board members sometimes provide peer review of submissions. A member may be asked to review several manuscripts per year and may edit a special issue. The members may also be consulted regarding new regulations at the journal. They are expected to promote the journal among their peers.

<doc id="1056003" wikidata="Q57486" url="?curid=1056003" title="Fundamental theorem of curves">
<text>In differential geometry, the fundamental theorem of space curves states that every regular curve in three-dimensional space, with non-zero curvature, has its shape (and size or scale) completely determined by its curvature and torsion.

==Use==
A curve can be described, and thereby defined, by a pair of scalar fields: curvature formula_1 and torsion formula_2, both of which depend on some parameter which parametrizes the curve but which can ideally be the arc length of the curve. From just the curvature and torsion, the vector fields for the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors can be derived using the Frenet–Serret formulas. Then, integration of the tangent field (done numerically, if not analytically) yields the curve.

==Congruence==
If a pair of curves are in different positions but have the same curvature and torsion, then they are congruent to each other.

<doc id="1056006" wikidata="Q80196062" url="?curid=1056006" title="Vulcan Iron Works">
<text>Vulcan Iron Works was the name of several iron foundries in both England and the United States during the Industrial Revolution and, in one case, lasting until the mid-20th century. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and smithery, was a popular namesake for these foundries.

==England==
During the Industrial Revolution, numerous entrepreneurs independently founded factories named Vulcan Iron Works in England, notably that of Robinson Thwaites and Edward Carbutt at Bradford, and that of Thomas Clunes at Worcester, England. The largest of all the ironworks of Victorian England, the Cleveland Works of Bolckow Vaughan in Middlesbrough, were on Vulcan Street.

===Thwaites &amp; Carbutt, Bradford===

The Vulcan Works at Thornton Road, Bradford was a spacious and handsome factory. It was described in Industries of Yorkshire as

===Ley&#x27;s, Derby===

The Vulcan Iron Works at Osmaston Road, Derby was founded in 1874 by Francis Ley (1846-1916). On a site occupying 11 acres by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, he manufactured castings for motor cars. The company became the Ley&#x27;s Malleable Castings Company Ltd. In the London Gazette of April 14, 1876, Ley was granted a patent for &quot;improvements in apparatus for locking and fastening nuts on fish plate and other bolts&quot;. The iron foundry was closed and demolished in 1986.

===McKenzie, Clunes &amp; Holland, Worcester===

The Vulcan Iron Works at Cromwell Street, Worcester was founded in 1857 by Thomas Clunes (b. 1818, d. 28 September 1879). The firm started out as &quot;Engineers, Millwrights, Iron &amp; Brass Founders, Plumbers etc&quot;, according to the listing in &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Directory&quot;. The works had a single tall tapering square chimney, a covered area with open sides, and a handsome main building on a largely open site on the west side of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal.

By 1861, Clunes, a former &quot;Plumber and Brass Founder&quot; from Aberdeen, Scotland living in St Martin&#x27;s, Worcester, with nine children, was a &quot;Master Engineer employing 104 men and 10 boys&quot;; his son Robert at age 11 was an &quot;Apprentice to Engineer&quot;. In 1861, Clunes was joined by two former railwaymen, McKenzie and Holland, and the firm moved into railway signalling equipment. Clunes retired to Fowey, Cornwall, and his name was dropped from the company&#x27;s name in the 1870s. The entry in the Worcestershire Post Office Directory for 1876 is simply &quot;RAILWAY SIGNAL MANFRS. McKenzie &amp; Holland, Vulcan Iron Works, Worcester.&quot;

===Vulcan Iron Works, Langley Mill===

The G R Turner company&#x27;s Vulcan Iron Works at Langley Mill, Derbyshire was built in 1874. GR Turner produced railway rolling stock until the 1960s; at its peak it employed 350 men. According to Grace&#x27;s Guide, G R Turner was established in 1863; it became a Limited Company in 1902, and was registered on 29 January 1903 as acquiring T N Turner&#x27;s business of &quot;engineer, wheel and wagon maker&quot;; in 1914 it was described as &quot;Colliery Engineers&quot; as well as making rolling stock, with 800 engineers.

===Vulcan Ironworks, Preston===
In 1857 the firm of Baxendale and Gregson was founded in Shepherd Street, Preston, Lancashire. When the works there became too small, the business moved to a new Vulcan Ironworks, built at Salter Street, just off North Road, Preston, under the name Gregson and Monk.

In 1873, James Gregson bought 82 acres of land at Fulwood; in 1876 he built Highgate Park mansion with the land as its extensive gardens. He owned much property in Preston and was a councillor of Fulwood District. His son George Frederick Gregson ran the firm after him.

When Monk retired in March 1874, James Gregson became sole proprietor. He employed about 400 men, making up to 100 weaving looms per week. Over 25,000 looms made by Gregson were claimed to be at work in or near Preston in 1884.

The machines made by the firm included:

The ironworks was reported in 1884 to have grindstones of 7 ft (2 metre) diameter; &quot;two cupolas blown by fans, one of which is capable of melting twenty tons of metal per day&quot;; cranes and hoists; a brass moulding shop; a sand mill (for the mouldings); and a machine for grinding coal to dust. The buildings included a draughtsmen&#x27;s office; a pattern makers&#x27; and joiners&#x27; shop; a packing room; an erecting and turning shop; and a smithy. All the machines were driven by rope from a single large wheel; two horizontal steam engines powered the entire ironworks. The journalist noted that &quot;The death rate among grinders is very high indeed, which it is almost impossible to prevent.&quot;

==United States==

===Seattle===

The Vulcan Iron Works in Seattle had Jacob Furth as its president. Furth ran the Vulcan Iron Works along with the Puget Sound Electric Railway and street railways on the Puget Sound.

===San Francisco===
A Vulcan Iron Works was established at 135 Fremont Street, San Francisco in 1850 during the California gold rush. The factory occupied the block bounded by Fremont, Mission, Howard, and First Streets. The factory maintained the name through a number of owners building boilers, steam engines, mining machinery, sawmills, and some relatively primitive steam locomotives for 19th century California railroads. It built the Oregon Pony in 1861. The factory was destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but steel fabrication activities resumed on the site after the quake.

===Charleston===
There was a Vulcan Iron Works on Cumberland Street, Charleston, South Carolina in 1865.

<text>The National Liberation Party (, PLN), nicknamed the (&quot;green and whites&quot;), is a political party in Costa Rica. The party is a member of the Socialist International. Social-democratic by statute, the party has a few internal factions, including liberals, Third Way supporters, centrists, and social conservatives.

== History ==
In 1948, a rebel group called National Liberation Army commanded by caudillo José Figueres Ferrer led a rebellion against the government of then President Rafael Angel Calderón Guardia and his communist allies. After the Civil War the rebels were victorious and Figueres took power de facto. Yet, Figueres did not overrule the social reforms made by Calderón and allies, like Social Security, almost free college education and Labor Laws but kept them and even made a series of progressive reforms himself like abolishing the army and introducing taxation on capital. Figueres gave up power in favor of the democratically elected president Otilio Ulate in 1949.

In 1951, the Social Democratic Party, the Centre for the Study of National Problems and the group Democratic Action formed the National Liberation Party in October 12 in order to participate in the 1953 election, the first election since the civil war, with Figueres as nominee and democratic socialism as their ideology. This election was very controversial as many parties were unable to participate, among others Calderon’s Republican Party and the Communists. Figueres won easily over the only other candidate with 60% of the votes.

For the 1958 general election, the PLN was split, as Jorge Rossi left the party after losing in the primaries and was basically an independent candidate thus splitting the Social Democrat vote. The PLN suffers it first defeat as oppositional candidate, liberal Mario Echandi, won the election with the support of Calderón. However, after this time, PLN will be clearly Costa Rica’s dominant party in the political system as only when the opposition ran united were capable of winning. This was the case in the 1966 and 1978 election, the rest of the time PLN’s nominees tended to win easily.

In 1986, then younger leader Óscar Arias won the party’s nomination facing the traditional leadership of the party, including Figueres. Arias won also the country’s presidency and his role in the negotiation of a peace agreement to stop the Central American Wars earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. Some critics inside and outside the party pointed Arias’ administration as more neo-liberal than socialist and as a switch from PLN’s traditional progressive views.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1983 when the Unity Coalition merged into the Social Christian Unity Party that PLN had to confront what was basically a party of the same dimensions. It is after this time that Costa Rica enters a two-party system with PLN and PUSC as the two main political forces and between the two 90% of the vote casting. However, in the 2000s, a new party was founded by many former PLN and PUSC leaders, among them former minister and deputy Ottón Solís, former First Lady Margarita Penón (Óscar Arias’ ex-wife) and notable writer and journalist Alberto Cañas. The new party named Citizens Action Party attracted many progressive voters dissatisfied with PLN’s turn to the right and is often pointed as one of the reasons for PLN’s nominee Rolando Araya’s defeat in the 2002 general election. In any case, after PUSC’ catastrophic debacle in 2005 due to a series of corruption scandals PAC became PLN’s main political rival. This was particularly notorious in the 2006 election with Óscar Arias looking for re-election and PAC’s candidate Ottón Solís. Most Costa Ricans showed mixed feelings over Arias, some admiring him and some others very oppose to his figure. That and the issue of CAFTA that polarized public opinion as basically half the population was in favor and half against apparently was translated into the voting polls as Arias (who was pro-CAFTA) and Solís (who was anti-CAFTA) were practically tied after the election. Arias won by a very slight margin of some 22,000 votes after an exhaustive counting.

In the same year&#x27;s parliamentary election, the party won 25 out of 57 seats. In the 2010 general election, Laura Chinchilla, the previous vice-president and the PLN candidate, won the election with an initial count of 47 percent.

A newspaper poll in July 2011 showed a decline in party popularity. Commentary on the poll pointed to an inherited fiscal crisis, border friction with Nicaragua, and natural disasters the previous November as contributing factors to public discontent.

In 2013, PLN’s candidate was San José Mayor since 1982 Johnny Araya (Rolando Araya’s brother) after other aspirants like former Presidential Minister Rodrigo Arias (Óscar Arias’ brother) and former president José María Figueres (José Figueres’ son) dropped from the race due to be very low in the polls making a primary unnecessary. Araya was the frontrunner for a while in most polls but he went second in the first electoral round earning only 29% of the votes, the lowest percentage ever for a PLN’s nominee, and behind PAC’s nominee Luis Guillermo Solís. For the run-off election Araya resign his candidacy arguing that he had no more money to run a campaign and that all polls showed him losing by wide margin. Effectively in the second round Solís won with 78% of the votes (1.3 million voters) and Araya gained only 22%.

Araya was expelled from the party after a resolution of the Ethics Committee due to his resignation as candidate in the second round (something unconstitutional, as the Constitution does not allow resigning a candidacy) thus Araya ran for Mayor of San José with a local party winning the election in the 2016 municipal election, in which PLN was the most voted party, yet it lost 14 mayoralties and received much fewer votes that in the previous municipal election.

The party, as then main opposition to Luis Guillermo Solís&#x27;s government, went into a very divisive primary in which then deputy Antonio Álvarez Desanti won over former president José María Figueres. Internal fighting made impossible to reach an agreement among the factions leading to Figueres withdrawing his support of Desanti&#x27;s nomination. Desanti, who had previously left the party whilst criticizing it for corruption and abandoning its social-democratic ideology, had the support of Oscar Arias and his brother Rodrigo, however. Nevertheless its results in the 2018 Costa Rican general election were crushing, as the party suffered its worst defeat in history with only 18% of votes and failing to gain a spot in the run-off ending as third for the first time in its history.

<text>Fine Young Cannibals is the debut studio album released in 1985 by the band of the same name. The album features the UK #8 debut hit single &quot;Johnny Come Home&quot;.

This success did not continue with the next single, &quot;Blue&quot;, which languished at #41 in the UK. The version of &quot;Blue&quot; on the original U.S. and Canadian vinyl LP and cassette was re-mixed and edited in an attempt to boost its commercial appeal. The re-mix version features additional electronically processed percussion overdubs, giving it a sound more typical of 1980s synthpop hits. Currently available CDs feature the re-mix version of &quot;Blue&quot; in place of the original U.S. album version.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Sounds&quot; writer Carole Linfield gave it a four and a half out of five rating. Stewart Mason, in an AllMusic retrospective review, commented that the album &quot;is a powerful and satisfying debut&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot;The lyrical content on most cuts isn&#x27;t terribly complicated, one thought turned around a few times; but the sparseness lays snug next to the inlays and wrap-arounds of Gift&#x27;s voice, along with the more than competent instrumental work, forever keeping the vocals buoyed up.&quot;

<doc id="1056023" wikidata="Q645263" url="?curid=1056023" title="Another 48 Hrs.">
<text>Another 48 Hrs. is a 1990 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Walter Hill and starring Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte, Brion James, Andrew Divoff, and Ed O&#x27;Ross. It is the sequel to the 1982 film &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; Nolte reprises his role as San Francisco police officer Jack Cates, who has 48 hours to clear his name from a manslaughter charge. To do so, he again needs the help of Reggie Hammond (Murphy), who is a newly released convict. At the same time, a mastermind known only as the Iceman has hired a biker gang to kill Reggie, while a rogue member of the gang (Divoff) is out to kill Jack for the death of his brother from the previous installment.

==Plot==
Veteran San Francisco Police Inspector Jack Cates has been after drug dealer the &quot;Iceman&quot; for the past five years. At the Hunter&#x27;s Point Raceway, Jack confronts Tyrone Burroughs and Arthur Brock. Jack kills Brock, while Burroughs escapes. Despite killing Brock in self-defense, Jack is now under investigation, as Brock&#x27;s gun cannot be found at the scene. Blake Wilson, the head of the Internal Affairs division, becomes determined to prosecute Jack on a third-degree manslaughter charge. Jack finds a picture that proves that the Iceman has put a price on the head of Reggie Hammond, who is scheduled to be released from prison the next day.

Reggie has completed his five year prison term for robbing a payroll (a crime for which he claims complete innocence), which he had been serving six months before. He is scheduled to be released. Jack tries to convince Reggie to help him clear his name and find the Iceman. Reggie requests that Jack gives him the $500,000 that Jack has been holding on to for him. Jack refuses to give Reggie the money unless Reggie helps him. After the bus transporting Reggie is attacked by two bikers and Jack gets shot, Jack forces Reggie to help him by having the hospital release Reggie into his custody. Reggie recognizes one of the two bikers as Richard &quot;Cherry&quot; Ganz, the brother of Albert Ganz, the escaped convict Jack killed years earlier. Cherry (who Reggie says, &quot;makes (Albert) Ganz look like Gandhi&quot;) and his partner Willie Hickok are the hitmen hired to kill Reggie, while Cherry also wants to kill Jack as revenge for Jack killing Albert. Burroughs, who works for the Iceman, was trying to hire Brock as insurance, just in case Cherry and Hickok failed. When the Iceman murders Hickok&#x27;s primary contact man, Malcolm Price, Hickok kills Burroughs, after the latter reveals himself to be an associate of the Iceman.

Reggie is captured by Cherry and Hickok, and Jack confronts the two criminals at a local nightclub where Ben Kehoe—Jack&#x27;s friend and fellow officer—is revealed to be the Iceman, with another detective, Frank Cruise, serving as an accomplice. A gunfight ensues, with Jack wounding Hickok and Cherry and killing Cruise. After killing both Hickok and Cherry, Reggie is held captive by Kehoe and used as a human shield. Reggie sarcastically begs Jack to shoot him. Jack does so, firing a shot into Reggie&#x27;s shoulder, wounding him and throwing him off Kehoe. Jack then shoots Kehoe, killing him. Before Reggie is transported to the hospital, Jack lets him know of the money he took off the Iceman and will meet him at the hospital to talk about it. As the ambulance leaves with Reggie, Jack realizes that Reggie has once again stolen his lighter. The two laugh about it.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development and writing===
Eddie Murphy had been paid $200,000 for his role in the original film. By the time of the sequel, his fee was $12,000,000 up front, plus a percentage of the gross.

The film was based on an original story by Murphy who asked Hill if he was interested in directing. 

Hill added that &quot;the plot – which Eddie suggested – is actually kind of intriguing. So why not do it?... A lot of folks will say I&#x27;m just doing it for the money. What I want to know is, why do they think I made the first one?&quot;

===Post-production===
The original workprint of the film was 145 minutes long. It was cut by either director Walter Hill or the Paramount studio down to 120 minutes, and a week before its summer theatrical release an additional 25 minutes were cut out by Paramount, making a final theatrical version 95 minutes long, but also creating a lot of plot holes and continuity mistakes in the film. Frank McRae&#x27;s reprisal of his role from the original &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; was entirely cut except for a brief, uncredited shot of him in the background of one scene in the police station. Also removed was a scene which was partially shown in the theatrical trailer in which Jack explains to Reggie that he has a deadline to track down the Iceman; as such, there is no mention of &#x27;48 hours&#x27; anywhere in the final film. Brion James, also returning from the original, saw his role severely cut down as well, to create a faster-paced action-comedy. In an interview, James said this about the cuts made on the film:

==Music==
# &quot;The Boys Are Back In Town&quot; - Jesse Johnson 4:01
# &quot;Give It All You Got&quot; - Curio 4:37
# &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Let It End&quot; - Curio 3:52
# Another 48 Hrs., film score~The Courthouse - James Horner 3:18
# Another 48 Hrs., film score~Main Title - James Horner 4:11
# Another 48 Hrs., film score~King Mei Shootout - James Horner 7:36
# Another 48 Hrs., film score~Birdcage Battle - James Horner 4:43
# I&#x27;ll Never Get You Out of This World Alive - Michael Stanton 2:25

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number one in the US with an opening weekend gross of $19,475,559, Paramount&#x27;s biggest opening non-holiday weekend gross, surpassing the record set by &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;. Overall, it grossed more at the US box office than its predecessor and made $72.7 million from foreign markets for a total of $153.5 million. However this was considered a box office disappointment and because the film was so costly, profits were minimized. Murphy accused Paramount of not spending enough on advertising and changing the release date. Paramount counter-alleged that Murphy did not spend enough time promoting the film. This led to tension in the long-running relationship between Murphy and Paramount.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 19% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Even the return of Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte, and director Walter Hill can&#x27;t hide the lazy, patchwork quality of &quot;Another 48 Hrs&quot;.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 23 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that it was &quot;as much a star vehicle for Mr. Murphy as &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; once was for Joan Crawford. The Crawford name isn&#x27;t idly invoked. You have to go back to the old MGM days to find movies that, with every gesture, let the audience know it was watching a star.&quot; Canby continued, &quot;Though the body count is high, all of the people killed are faceless or only minor characters, until the end. It&#x27;s as if the movie were saying that lethal violence is acceptable (and fun) as long as the victims–like the victims of guided missiles and high-altitude bombing–remain anonymous. Any comedy that allows the mind to ponder high-altitude bombing is in deep trouble.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Peter Rainer called it &quot;a crude rehashing of the high points of the first film.&quot; Ranier singled out director Hill, who he said &quot;surely recognizes the hollowness of what he&#x27;s doing here. He tries to ram through the muddled exposition as quickly as possible; essentially, the film is wall-to-wall mayhem, with more shots of hurled bodies shattering windows than I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie.&quot;

<text>The Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle (SAM-R) is a semi-automatic designated marksman rifle developed and used by the United States Marine Corps. It gave users the capability to provide fire in support of a rifle squad, providing precision fire in support of an assault, and aid in observation and adjusting of supporting arms. 

The SAM-R was retired by the U.S. military in the mid-2010s and thus is no longer in service, having been replaced by the M27 IAR.

==History==

The Squad Advanced Marksman and his weapon, the Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle, was the product of extensive experimentation by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) of the addition of a designated marksman to a Marine squad. The concept of a designated marksman was already in use by the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (Anti-Terrorism) and Marine Corps Security Force Regiment. In exercises, a Marine with a scoped rifle and additional training provided immense benefit to small units. An optic provides information-gathering abilities as well as aiding aiming of support weapons such as machine guns and mortars.

The armorers at the MCWL decided to use the M16 rifle in order to maintain a certain level of commonality in both weapon and ammunition. There was some talk of adopting a weapon such along the same lines as the Mk 11 Mod 0, but instead that transferred over to a possible replacement for USMC personnel now using the Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR), a variant of the M14.

The SAM-Rs were assembled by the Precision Weapons Section of the Weapons Training Battalion at Marine Corps Base Quantico. For the War on Terrorism, the approximately 100 assembled SAM-Rs were sent to the 22nd, 24th, and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) of II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which is located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Squad Advanced Marksmen of I MEF, which is based at Camp Pendleton, California, made do with M16A4s with KAC M5 RAS forearms and TA31F ACOGs. 

Some SAM-Rs are nicknamed &quot;West Coast SAM-Rs&quot;, though they are simply M16A4s with optics and bipods and not an &#x27;accurized&#x27; rifle like the SAM-R used by the Marines of II MEF.

They were in use by the USMC. The British Army reportedly used a small number.

===Replacement===
After a lengthy period of debate over the role of accuracy &quot;vs.&quot; suppressive fire in the Marines, they adopted a new doctrine and weapon in the more accurate M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle for their service rifle in September 2018 and it will replace most of the M4 Carbine for the infantry.

Certain M27s are selected for accuracy; when provided with scopes and suppressors they are designated as the M38 Designated Marksman Rifle. The rifles are distributed one per squad.

==Design==

The original test weapon was a modified M16A2 rifle with a free-floated 1:7 stainless steel match grade heavy barrel, a &quot;Mil-Std-1913 modular rail system&quot; (this most likely implies the use of the Knight&#x27;s Armament Company Free-Floating Rail Adapter System) and an M16A1 trigger assembly (semi and full-auto functioning).

A number of day optics were used initially, which included Hensoldt Blitz, Leupold CQ/T, ACOG, Leupold TS-30A1 and ultimately the Leupold TS-30A2. The test night optic was the AN/PVS-17B, apparently now being fielded with USMC combat units though the AN/PVS-22 is preferred.

SAM-Rs use 5.56 NATO-based MK262 ammo.

The later SAM-R was roughly a modified M16A4 pattern rifle:

* Upper &amp; Lower Receivers: The lower and upper receivers are standard M16A4. The SAM-R has a standard M16A1 single-stage trigger installed, which allows limited use as an automatic rifle, ammunition permitting (See Mk 262 Mod 1), but there also have been examples using Knight&#x27;s Armament (henceforth referred to as KAC) two-stage match triggers. The SAM-R is also equipped with a PRI M84 Gas Buster charging handle system and a Norgon ambidextrous magazine release.
* Barrel: The barrel is a long 1: twist match grade stainless steel barrel, manufactured by Compass Lake Engineering from Krieger blanks. Current SAM-Rs are equipped with &#x27;chipped&#x27; flash suppressors to allow attachment of the KAC M4 quick-detach sound suppressor, while earlier examples were fielded with standard compensators.
* Sights &amp; Optics: For iron sights, the SAM-R uses the KAC 600-Meter flip-up rear sight. The first SAM-Rs used a custom Quantico-built gas block with bayonet lug and Picatinny rail on top. A KAC flip-up sight was mounted on that rail. Some intermediate models used separate gas blocks and barrel attached bayonet lugs. Current rifles are built with a special KAC-made gas block that has both a flip-up sight and a bayonet lug. The issued day optic is the TS-30A2 (military designation for Leupold&#x27;s Mark 4 M3 2.5-8 x 36mm MR/T Illuminated riflescope) mounted with ARMS #22 high rings, the same configuration used with the Mk 12 Mod 0/1 SPR, though more recent photos indicate the four-power Marine Corps Rifle Combat Optic ACOG is also used at times. The folding front sight mentioned earlier was designed for use with the AN/PVS-22 Universal Night Sight.
* Handguard: The SAM-R uses the KAC Free-Floating Rail Adapter System, which provides a modular mounting location for all types of equipment. SAM-Rs are usually seen with Harris swivel bipods attached to this rail via a KAC bipod stud.

<doc id="1056044" wikidata="Q131889" url="?curid=1056044" title="Nimravidae">
<text>Nimravidae is an extinct family of carnivorans, sometimes known as false saber-toothed cats, whose fossils are found in North America and Eurasia. Not considered to belong to the true cats (family Felidae), the nimravids are generally considered closely related and classified as a distinct family in the suborder Feliformia. Fossils have been dated from the Middle Eocene through the Late Miocene epochs (Bartonian through Tortonian stages, 40.4–9.7 million years ago), spanning about .

The barbourofelids, which were formerly classified as a subfamily of the Nimravidae, were reassigned to their own distinct family Barbourofelidae in 2004. However, some recent (2020) studies suggest the barbourofelids are a branch of the nimravids, suggesting that this debate might not be settled yet.

==Morphology and evolution==
Most nimravids had muscular, low-slung, cat-like bodies, with shorter legs and tails than are typical of cats. Unlike extant Feliformia, the nimravids had a different bone structure in the small bones of the ear. The middle ear of true cats is housed in an external structure called an auditory bulla, which is separated by a septum into two chambers. Nimravid remains show ossified bullae with no septum, or no trace at all of the entire bulla. They are assumed to have had a cartilaginous housing of the ear mechanism. Nimravid feet were short, indicating they walked in a plantigrade or semiplantigrade posture, i.e., on the flat of the feet rather than the toes, like modern cats.

Although some nimravids physically resembled the saber-toothed cats, such as &quot;Smilodon&quot;, they were not closely related, but evolved a similar form through parallel evolution. They possessed synapomorphies with the barbourofelids in the cranium, mandible, dentition, and postcranium. They also had a downward-projecting flange on the front of the mandible as long as the canine teeth, a feature which also convergently evolved in the saber-toothed sparassodont &quot;Thylacosmilus&quot;.

The ancestors of nimravids and cats diverged from a common ancestor soon after the Caniformia–Feliformia split, in the middle Eocene about 50 million years ago (Mya), with a minimum constraint of 43 Mya. Recognizable nimravid fossils date from the late Eocene (37 Mya), from the Chadronian White River Formation at Flagstaff Rim, Wyoming, to the late Miocene (9.7 Mya), assuming Barbourofelidae were members of the Nimravid superfamily. Nimravid diversity appears to have peaked about 28 Mya.

A 2021 study has shown that a sizeable number of species developed feline-like morphologies in addition to saber-toothed taxa.

==Taxonomy==
The family Nimravidae was named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1880, with the type genus as &quot;Nimravus.&quot; The family was assigned to Fissipedia by Cope (1889); to Caniformia by Flynn and Galiano (1982); to Aeluroidea by Carroll (1988); to Feliformia by Bryant (1991); and to Carnivoramorpha, by Wesley-Hunt and Werdelin (2005).

Nimravids are placed in tribes by some authors to reflect closer relationships between genera within the family. Some nimravids evolved into large, toothed, cat-like forms with massive flattened upper canines and accompanying mandibular flanges. Some had dentition similar to felids, or modern cats, with smaller canines. Others had moderately increased canines in a more intermediate relationship between the saber-toothed cats and felids. The upper canines were not only shorter, but also more conical, than those of the true saber-toothed cats (Machairodontinae). These nimravids are referred to as &quot;false saber-tooths&quot;.

Not only did nimravids exhibit diverse dentition, but they also showed the same diversity in size and morphology as cats. Some were leopard-sized, others the size of today&#x27;s lions and tigers, one had the short face, rounded skull, and smaller canines of the modern cheetah, and one, &quot;Nanosmilus&quot;, was only the size of a small bobcat.

The Barbourofelids were for a while no longer included in Nimravidae, following elevation to family as sister clade to the true cats (family Felidae). However, several recent studies have returned them to Nimravidae, including as part of Nimravinae.

===Phylogeny===
The phylogenetic relationships of Nimravidae are shown in the following cladogram:

A 2021 study divides Nimravidae into Hoplophoninae and Nimravinae, the latter including the bulk of species in addition to barbourofelids.

Phylogeny of Nimravidae from the 2022 description of &quot;Pangurban&quot;:

==Natural history==
Nimravids appeared in the middle of the Eocene epoch, about 40 Mya, in North America and Asia. The global climate at this time was warm and wet, but was trending cooler and drier toward the late Eocene. The lush forests of the Eocene were transforming to scrub and open woodland. This climatic trend continued in the Oligocene, and nimravids evidently flourished in this environment. North America and Asia were connected and shared much related fauna. Europe in the Oligocene was more of an archipelago than a continent, though some land bridges must have existed, for nimravids also spread there.

In the Miocene, the fossil record suggests that many animals suited for living in forest or woodland were replaced by grazers suited for grassland. This suggests that much of North America and Asia became dominated by savanna. Nimravids disappeared along with the woodlands, but survived in relictual humid forests in Europe to the late Miocene. When conditions ultimately changed there in the late Miocene, the last nimravids disappeared about 9 Mya.

<text>Hao Wang (; 20 May 1921 – 13 May 1995) was a Chinese-American logician, philosopher, mathematician, and commentator on Kurt Gödel.

==Biography==
Born in Jinan, Shandong, in the Republic of China (today in the People&#x27;s Republic of China), Wang received his early education in China. He obtained a BSc degree in mathematics from the National Southwestern Associated University in 1943 and an M.A. in philosophy from Tsinghua University in 1945, where his teachers included Feng Youlan and Jin Yuelin, after which he moved to the United States for further graduate studies. He studied logic under W. V. O. Quine at Harvard University, culminating in a Ph.D. in 1948. He was appointed to an assistant professorship at Harvard the same year.

During the early 1950s, Wang studied with Paul Bernays in Zürich. In 1956, he was appointed Reader in the Philosophy of Mathematics at the University of Oxford. In 1959, Wang wrote on an IBM 704 computer a program that in only 9 minutes mechanically proved several hundred mathematical logic theorems in Whitehead and Russell&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. In 1961, he was appointed Gordon McKay Professor of Mathematical Logic and Applied Mathematics at Harvard. From 1967 until 1991, he headed the logic research group at Rockefeller University in New York City, where he was professor of logic. In 1972, Wang joined in a group of Chinese American scientists led by Chih-Kung Jen as the first such delegation from the U.S. to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

One of Wang&#x27;s most important contributions was the Wang tile. He showed that any Turing machine can be turned into a set of Wang tiles. The domino problem is to find an algorithm that uses a set of Wang tiles to tile the plane. The first noted example of aperiodic tiling is a set of Wang tiles, whose nonexistence Wang had once conjectured, discovered by his student Robert Berger in 1966. Wang also had a significant influence on theory of computational complexity.

A philosopher in his own right, Wang also developed a penetrating interpretation of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s later philosophy of mathematics, which he called &quot;anthropologism.&quot; Later he broadened this reading in the foundations of mathematics. He chronicled Kurt Gödel&#x27;s philosophical ideas and authored several books on the subject, thereby providing contemporary scholars many insights elucidating Gödel&#x27;s later philosophical thought. He saw his own philosophy of &quot;substantial factualism&quot; as a middle ground that includes both abstract theoretical formulations and the ordinary language of everyday discourse.

In 1983 he was presented with the first Milestone Prize for Automated Theorem-Proving, sponsored by the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

On 13 May 1995, Wang died at New York Hospital one week from his 74th birthday. According to his wife Hanne Tierney, Wang&#x27;s cause of death was from lymphoma. In addition to Tierney, Wang was survived by a daughter and two sons.

<doc id="1056055" wikidata="Q2485376" url="?curid=1056055" title="Slieve Croob">
<text>Slieve Croob () is a mountain with a height of in the middle of County Down, Northern Ireland. It is the heart of a mountainous area, the Dromara Hills, north of the Mourne Mountains. It is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is the source of the River Lagan. There is a small road to the summit, where there is an ancient burial cairn and several transmitter stations with radio masts. It has wide views over all of County Down and further afield. The Dromara Hills also includes Slievenisky, Cratlieve, Slievegarran and Slievenaboley.

Slieve Croob may have been the mountain named &quot;Brí Erigi&quot; or &quot;Brí Airige&quot; in medieval writings. The cairn on its summit is believed to be the remains of an ancient burial mound, possibly of a passage tomb like the one on Slieve Gullion. In the 19th century it was recorded to be around and in &quot;conical height&quot;, with forty-two &quot;pillar stones&quot; or kerbstones around the edge. The cairn would have had a well-defined shape when it was built. Still, over time it has slipped and been damaged by visitors. Irish folklore holds that it is bad luck to damage such cairns. Some of its stones have been piled into smaller cairns on top of it, which led to the summit being nicknamed &#x27;The Twelve Cairns&#x27;. Traditionally, people would gather on the summit at Lughnasadh where they would add a stone to one of the cairns. They would collect and eat bilberries and there would be folk music, dancing and games.

Local people still climb the mountain on the first Sunday in August (referred to as Cairn Sunday or Blaeberry Sunday), and carry a stone up the mountain to help bury the twelve Kings, who are said to be buried at the top.

Legannany Dolmen sits on the southern slopes of Slieve Croob near the village of Leitrim.

<doc id="1056058" wikidata="Q1997005" url="?curid=1056058" title="Beebe Plain, Vermont">
<text>Beebe Plain is an unincorporated community in the town of Derby in Orleans County, Vermont, United States, which extends into the municipality of Stanstead, Quebec, Canada. The village is divided by the Canada–United States border between Canada and the United States; the Canadian portion of Beebe Plain had the status of an incorporated municipality in its own right until 1995.

== Geography ==

The international border runs up the middle of Canusa Street (Quebec Route 247). Local legend claims that a group of rather drunken surveyors, when given the task of determining the United States-Canada border line in the region (nominally at 45.00°N), decided to place the border right through the center of the village along what is now Canusa Street.

Beebe Plain is part of a group of nearby border villages which includes Derby Line, Vermont and Stanstead, Quebec. Beebe Plain is located near Lake Memphremagog between Newport and Magog.

== Industry ==
Beebe granite or &quot;Stanstead Grey Granite&quot; is famous for its use in architectural design. The production of granite from the region may well be the largest industry, with much of the stone being used in the construction of tombstones and memorials.

==History==
The village was founded circa 1798 by Thomas B. Beebe, born 1776 in Windsor, Vermont.

==Features==
The former Massawippi Valley Railway line once joined Lennoxville, Quebec through a border crossing at Beebe Plain to Newport, Vermont. That line was abandoned and removed by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1989–1991. Portions of the former right-of-way remain open for recreational use:
* Beebe Plain, Vermont to Waterfront Park (Main Street, US 5) Newport as the Newport Bike Path. 
* Beebe Plain, Québec to Ayer&#x27;s Cliff, a bicycle and pedestrian trail, le sentier nature Tomifobia.
* Beebe Junction, Québec to Stanstead village (a former spur), as the Piste Cyclable de Stanstead
* a segment from North Hatley to Lennoxville, Quebec

The section between Beebe&#x27;s rue Principale (Québec Route 247) and North Derby Road (US) is no longer open, forcing cyclists onto Beebe&#x27;s main street. A section between Ayer&#x27;s Cliff and North Hatley is also no longer open.

<text>Ham is a small village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. The parish borders the county of Berkshire, and the village lies about south of the Berkshire town of Hungerford.

Ham Hill is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

== History ==
Ham is first mentioned in a charter of 931, in which King Æthelstan granted land to his thegn Wulfgar. The modern boundaries of Ham parish are little changed from those defined in clauses attached to the charter. Wulfgar willed the estate to his wife and then to the Old Minster, Winchester.

The Domesday book of 1086 recorded a settlement of twenty households at &quot;Hame&quot;, on land held by the Bishop of Winchester. In the 13th century, Ham was considered to be part of Savernake Forest. By 1284 the estate was assigned to St. Swithun&#x27;s Priory, Winchester, and continued to support the monks until the Dissolution. In 1541 it was granted to the chapter of Winchester Cathedral, who retained ownership until the manor and land were sold in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The Manor House, west of the church, is from the 17th century with changes and additions in the late 18th and 19th. It is a Grade II* listed building. Dove&#x27;s House, northwest of the village green, is early 18th and also Grade II* listed. Ham Spray House, just east of Ham village at is c. 1830. An Ordnance Survey map published in 1961 shows the house and outbuildings standing in parkland; today, large agricultural buildings are immediately north of the house.

A National School was built opposite the Crown and Anchor in 1874, replacing a small schoolroom which was attended by 61 pupils on return day in 1871. The number of children fell during the 20th century but increased on the closure of the Buttermere school in 1944. By 1980 there were only 17 pupils and the school was closed.

== Parish church ==
A church at Ham was recorded in 1172. The current All Saints&#x27; Church dates from the 13th century and has a 14th-century tower. Restoration during the 18th century saw the tower refaced and a north porch added; inside a west gallery was inserted, lit by a dormer window on each side. The interior is largely from the 18th century, the church having escaped Victorian restoration except for minor works in 1849.

The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1986. The benefice was united in 1933 with Buttermere, and in 1956 with Shalbourne. Today the parish forms part of the Savernake team ministry.

==Local government==

<text>Ham (; ) is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France, northern France.

==Geography==
Ham is situated on the D930 and D937 crossroads, some southwest of Saint-Quentin, in the far southeast of the department, near the border with the department of the Aisne. Ham (Somme) station has rail connections to Amiens, Saint-Quentin and Laon. The nearby villages of Estouilly and Saint-Sulpice joined the commune of Ham in 1965 and 1966 respectively.

==Population==

The population data given in the table and graph below for 1962 and earlier refer to the commune of Ham excluding Estouilly and Saint-Sulpice.

==History==
Mentioned for the first time in 932 as a possession of the seigneur Erard, junior member of the Counts of Ponthieu. The town was later conquered by the Counts of Vermandois in the 12th century. In the 14th century it was owned by a family from Ham itself. From April 7 to June 3, 1917, Ham was home to the Lafayette Escadrille

==The Castle of Ham==

The first stone ramparts were put up in the 13th century by the local nobleman, Odon IV.

In the 15th century, the château was transformed into a formidable fortress by John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny.

In 1465, John&#x27;s nephew, Louis of Luxembourg, built a huge donjon, 33m high, 33m in diameter with walls 11m thick.

In 1917, German forces blew up much of the château. All that remains are the entrance tower and vestiges of the donjon and ramparts.

<text>Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers is a 1988 book by sociologist Robert Jackall that investigates the world of corporate managers in the United States.

In the introduction, Jackall writes that he &quot;went into these organizations to study how bureaucracy—the prevailing organizational form of our society—shapes moral consciousness&quot; and that the book is &quot;an interpretive sociological account of how managers think the world works.&quot;

It was named the &quot;Most Outstanding Business and Management Book&quot; of 1988 by the Association of American Publishers.

==Summary==

&quot;Moral Mazes&quot; is based on several years of fieldwork during which the author conducted interviews with managers in several large corporations in the early 1980s.

From these interviews, the book describes the social construction of reality within large corporations in the United States. The book argues that bureaucracy in large American corporations: &quot;regularizes people&#x27;s experiences of time and indeed routinizes their lives by engaging them on a daily basis in rational, socially approved, purposive action; it brings them into daily proximity with and subordination to authority, creating in the process upward-looking stances that have decisive social and psychological consequences; it places a premium on a functionally rational, pragmatic habit of mind that seeks specific goals; and it creates subtle measures of prestige and an elaborate status hierarchy that, in addition to fostering an intense competition for status, also makes the rules, procedures, social contexts, and protocol of an organization paramount psychological and behavioral guides.&quot;Perhaps the most important finding is that successful managers are dexterous symbol manipulators. Successful managers provide a public face and may be categorized as providing emotional labor as one of their major activities. They must be able to work well with others and to sublimate their emotional and psychological needs to the demands of others. The very ambiguity of their work and its assessment leads to the feeling on the part of the managers that &quot;instead of ability, talent, and dedicated service to an organization, politics, adroit talk, luck, connections, and self-promotion are the real sorters of people into sheep and goats&quot;.

== Structure ==
The book begins with historical context. It shows how the organizational structure of American business changed in the 19th century. The author explains the creation of large corporations in the context of how the Industrial Revolution changed American industry. These changes demanded a professional management class. This new class then changed the organizational culture of American business, emphasizing decisions centered on money-based measures such as profit and loss (see also rational choice theory).

The book then describes the results of the author&#x27;s interviews. The author&#x27;s research included interviews with managers at various levels of the organizations. These unnamed organizations are large and medium-sized companies. The qualitative data collected by the interviews cover approximately four years, beginning in 1980, documenting changes in management within the corporations, business decisions, and the effect of those changes and decisions on the managers.

==Popularity among Hacktivists==

&quot;Moral Mazes&quot; was one of the &quot;very favorite books&quot; of hacktivist Aaron Swartz, making it an influential book within that community. Peter Ludlow, a writer on hacktivist culture, used the world of &quot;Moral Mazes&quot; to explain the actions of Edward Snowden.

<doc id="1056082" wikidata="Q1154517" url="?curid=1056082" title="2007 Australian federal election">
<text>The 2007 Australian federal election was held in Australia on 24 November 2007. All 150 seats in the House of Representatives and 40 of the seats in the 76-member Senate were up for election. The election featured a 39-day campaign, with 13.6 million Australians enrolled to vote.

The centre-left Australian Labor Party opposition, led by Kevin Rudd and deputy leader Julia Gillard, defeated the incumbent centre-right Coalition government, led by Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister, John Howard, and Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, by a landslide. The election marked the end of the 11 year Howard Liberal-National Coalition government that had been in power since the 1996 election. This election also marked the start of the six-year Rudd-Gillard Labor government.

Future Prime Minister Scott Morrison, future opposition leader Bill Shorten and future Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles entered parliament at this election. This would be the last time the Labor Party would win a majority at the federal level until the 2022 election. This remains the most recent election in which both major parties won over 40% of first preference votes. 

Rudd became the third Labor leader after World War II to lead the party to victory from opposition, after Gough Whitlam in 1972, Bob Hawke in 1983, and before most recently Anthony Albanese in 2022.

Although the Coalition was defeated, the results in Western Australia bucked the national trend. While there was a swing against the Liberal Party and to the Labor Party, which allowed Labor to gain the seat of Hasluck from the Liberals, the Liberals managed to gain the seats of Cowan and Swan from Labor.

==Key dates==
* Prorogation of 41st Parliament: 12 noon, 15 October
* Dissolution of House of Representatives: 12 noon, 17 October
* Issue of electoral writs: 17 October
* Close of rolls (if not currently on roll): 8 p.m., 17 October
* Close of rolls (if currently on roll and updating details): 8 p.m., 23 October
* Close of nominations: 12 noon, 1 November
* Declaration of nominations: 12 noon, 2 November
* Polling Day: 24 November
* Territory senators begin their terms: 24 November 2007
* Return of writs: 21 December
* First meeting of the 42nd Parliament: 12 February 2008
* New state senators begin their terms: 1 July 2008

Under the provisions of the Constitution, the current House of Representatives may continue for a maximum of three years from the first meeting of the House after the previous federal election. The first meeting of the 41st Parliament after the 2004 election was on 16 November 2004, hence the parliament would have expired on 15 November 2007 had it not been dissolved earlier. There must be a minimum of 33 days and a maximum of 68 days between the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the day of the election. Prime Minister Howard opted for a 39-day campaign.

The prime minister of the day chooses the election date and requests the governor-general to dissolve the House and issue the writs for the election. On 14 October, John Howard gained the agreement of the governor-general, Major-General Michael Jeffery, to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general election for the House and half the Senate on 24 November 2007.

During the last term of parliament before the 2007 election, the deadline for new voter enrolment was brought forward from 7 working days after the issue of the writ to the same day. When the election was announced, the writ was not issued the next day, but on the following Wednesday. This kept the roll open for three days, during which 77,000 enrolment additions were processed.

==Pre-election issues==
Roy Morgan polling in June 2007 reported WorkChoices was a reason for Labor party support, and a fear of union dominance and support for Coalition economic management policy as the biggest reasons behind the Coalition vote. Several big business organisations, including the Australian Industry Group, declined a request from the Prime Minister to run advertisements to counter the union-funded campaign. The share of voters concerned about industrial relations grew from 31 per cent to 53 per cent in the two years to June 2006, with around three-fifths of voters backing Labor&#x27;s ability to handle the issue over the Liberal Party.

A Newspoll released in June 2006 reported health and Medicare were the most important issue for voters; 83 per cent of respondents rated it &quot;very important&quot;. Other key issues included education (79 per cent), the economy (67 per cent), the environment (60 per cent) and national security (60 per cent). Taxation and interest rates, key issues in previous campaigns, were rated very important by 54 per cent and 51 per cent respectively. Immigration, a key issue in 2001, scored 43 per cent. The poll showed that voters considered Labor marginally better-placed to handle health and education, and gave the government strong backing on the economy and national security.

Kevin Rudd promised Labor would introduce a greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 60 per cent by 2050, ratify the Kyoto protocol and introduce a mandatory renewable energy target (MRET) of 20 per cent by 2020. The Howard government reiterated their position of not ratifying the Kyoto protocol, setting &quot;voluntary aspirational emission reduction targets&quot; and introducing a carbon emissions trading scheme by 2012.

Labor pledged a $4.7 billion fibre-to-the-node broadband network.
On 7 June in a speech promoting the government&#x27;s handling of the economy, Treasurer Peter Costello recalled the learner driver slogan of the 2004 election: &quot;This [the economy] is like a highly engineered racing car and I tell you what, I wouldn&#x27;t be putting an L-plate driver in the cockpit at the moment&quot;. August 2007 saw, for the first time during an election campaign, a 0.25-point interest-rate rise to 6.5 per cent by the Reserve Bank, the sixth rise since the last election in 2004. Labor used the news to argue that the Coalition could not be trusted to keep interest rates low, while Costello argued that interest rates would be higher under Labor. In November 2007 interest rates were raised for the sixth time since the 2004 election, to a 10-year high of 6.75 per cent. In response to Labor criticism of the government on the rate rises, Howard stated in August 2007 &quot;[Rudd] can scour every transcript, and I will make them available, of every interview that I gave during that election campaign and he will find no such commitment. During October 2007 Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews&#x27;s decision to cut Australia&#x27;s refugee intake and expressing public concern about Sudanese migrants was branded as racist.

The Queensland Labor Premier, Anna Bligh, described Andrews&#x27; criticism of Sudanese as &quot;disturbing&quot;. She said: &quot;It has been a long time since I have heard such a pure form of racism out of the mouth of any Australian politician.&quot; Labor politician Tony Burke branded Andrews&#x27; decision as &quot;incompetent&quot;. However, Andrew&#x27;s actions were applauded by the former One Nation politician, Pauline Hanson. Andrews was accused of helping to fuel assaults of Sudanese. During the controversy one criticism was that Andrews justified his decision based on &quot;concerns raised by the community&quot;, however no official report or inquest has been tendered, leading to the conclusion that any &#x27;concerns&#x27; were both unofficial, undocumented and possibly belonging to a racially intolerant minority. The Howard government had before used the race card in an election year to distract the voters from its other perceived failures. This was most significant in the 2001 election with the infamous Tampa affair, in which the government was badly trailing in the polls before vilifying middle-eastern &quot;boat people&quot;. The strategy worked for the government by exploiting the underlying racist elements of Australian society. Andrews defended the system of having refugee quotas against the opinion expressed that intakes of refugees should be variated on the basis of global needs .&quot; In October 2007, Howard &quot;admitted breaking a promise to keep interest rates at record lows&quot;. During the 2004 campaign, Howard was also cited as giving the same promise, personally, on radio. Inflation figures released on 24 October indicated underlying inflation was higher than expected, which resulted in seven of eight financial companies believing there will be an interest rate rise when the reserve bank met in the middle of November, the first during an election campaign.

Rudd advocated four-year fixed terms for federal parliaments if elected. Howard supported four-year terms but opposed fixed election dates. Any change would require approval by referendum. In mid-October, Howard said that if re-elected, the government would hold a referendum on the inclusion a statement of reconciliation in the preamble of the constitution.

==Election campaign==

===Week 1===

On 14 October, Howard announced a 24 November election. The Coalition had been trailing Labor in the polls since 2006, and most pundits predicted that Howard would not be re-elected. ABC Online election analyst Antony Green noted the Coalition&#x27;s numbers were similar to what Labor had polled before losing power in 1996.
Howard&#x27;s theme concentrated on leadership, stating that the nation &quot;does not need new leadership, it does not need old leadership. It needs the right leadership&quot; He said his government would strive to achieve full employment, which he argued was less likely under Kevin Rudd. In response, Rudd also concentrated on leadership, outlining his case for &quot;new leadership&quot;. He argued that the government had &#x27;lost touch&#x27; with the electorate, and that the Labor Party was best suited to deal with challenges that lie ahead.

A Galaxy poll showed a Labor 53-47 per cent Coalition two-party-preferred result, with a 2 per cent gap on primaries, and ACNielsen polling reported a 2 per cent swing to the Coalition, reducing Labor&#x27;s lead to 54–46. Rudd dropped 5 per cent as preferred prime minister. A Newspoll sampling 1,700 voters taken over the weekend prior to the leaders&#x27; debate reported a swing to Labor, increasing their two-party-preferred lead to 58 per cent, a rise of 2 points. Labor&#x27;s primary vote increased 3 points to 51 per cent, and the Liberals decreased by 2 points to 34 per cent. Rudd extended his lead by 2 points to 50 per cent, with Howard down by 2 points to 37 per cent.

On the first full day of the campaign, Howard and Costello announced a &#x27;major restructuring of the income tax system&#x27; with tax cuts worth $35 billion over three years and a tax cut &quot;goal&quot; for the next five years. A few days later, Rudd released his policy which supported the reform measures, however offered education and health tax rebates instead of immediate cuts to the top rate as proposed by the Liberal Party, with a slower progression for the top rate.

The Liberals slogan, &quot;go for growth&quot; was launched after announcing the largest tax cut in Australian history. Media and political commentators questioned the suitability of the slogan in the context of rising inflation and interest rates.

During the latter part of the week union influence over the ALP was questioned after the launch of the Liberal party&#x27;s first campaign ads. Labor responded with commercials attacking the Liberals&#x27; campaign as &#x27;smears&#x27;, which was disputed by John Howard. One of the Liberal Party election commercials was corrected after it incorrectly said Wayne Swan and Craig Emerson had previously been union officials.

====Leaders&#x27; debate====
A debate between the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister, under the moderation of the National Press Club, was shown live on ABC TV, the Nine Network, and Sky News Australia at 7.30 pm on 21 October. Rudd had called for a minimum of three debates between himself and Howard, while Howard, who had been rated poorly by studio audiences at past leadership debates, pressed for a single debate. A total of 2.4 million Australians watched the event, with Nine averaging 1.42 million, the ABC averaging 907,000, and Sky News averaging 62,000. The last election debate in 2004 was watched by 1.77 million on Nine and the ABC, while in 2001, average audiences on Nine, Seven and the ABC totalled 2.44 million. David Speers, Sky News&#x27;s political editor, moderated the debate which was held in the Great Hall of Parliament House. The debate audience was 400, with the Coalition and Labor each selecting 200.

Kevin Rudd argued that the Liberal Party was being influenced by the H. R. Nicholls Society to make further reforms to industrial relations, citing Nick Minchin&#x27;s speech at the Society&#x27;s 2008 conference where he told the audience that the Coalition &quot;knew its reform to WorkChoices were not popular but the process of change must continue&quot;, and that &quot;there is still a long way to go... awards, the IR commission, all the rest of it...&quot; In response to the Liberal Party message that 70 per cent of Labor&#x27;s front bench was made up of former union officials, Rudd said 70 per cent of Liberal Party ministers were either lawyers or former Liberal Party staffers. On the same day, Peter Costello admitted when questioned that the 70 per cent figure was in reference to union members rather than union officials.

Rudd said that Howard had &quot;no plan for the future&quot; on tackling climate change. Howard said that a Coalition government would establish a climate change fund after 2011, which would be financed by carbon offsets.

The Nine Network, which broadcast the debate as an extended edition of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, used &#x27;the Worm&#x27; in its broadcast despite prior objections from the Liberal Party and action from the National Press Club to cease its video feed. As a result, the Nine Network&#x27;s feed was cut part way into the broadcast, which Nine then replaced with Sky News&#x27;s coverage. The Nine television network&#x27;s live audience, via the Worm&#x27;s average, scored the debate 65 to 29 in Rudd&#x27;s favour, with 6 per cent remaining undecided. Both sides, however, claimed victory. Nine had a separate group of 80 it said were &#x27;swinging&#x27; voters (chosen by McNair Research) in its studio to control &#x27;the Worm&#x27;. Steps were taken to ensure equal numbers so as not to taint the Worm. At one point, Peter Costello was asked to cease interjecting.

===Week 2===

Figures released on the Tuesday, showed a stronger than expected underlying rate of inflation of 3 per cent. Treasurer Peter Costello argued against an increase in interest rates, saying the Reserve Bank should concentrate on the headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate which rose of 1.9 per cent for the period.

Controversy arose over the Coalition&#x27;s climate change policy, with &quot;The Financial Review&quot; citing &quot;government sources&quot; who claimed Turnbull told Cabinet six weeks ago it should sign the Kyoto Protocol. Neither Howard nor Turnbull denied the story. The story said that &quot;internal critics&quot; are claiming Turnbull is &quot;selfishly positioning himself for a Coalition defeat&quot; and a &quot;possible post-poll leadership battle with Treasurer Peter Costello&quot;. The story led to claims of major splits in Cabinet.

Labor also suffered from mixed messages. Kevin Rudd was compelled to clarify Labor policy on climate change after an interview in which Peter Garrett suggested Labor would sign up to the post-Kyoto agreement at 2012 even if carbon-emitting developing countries did not. Rudd&#x27;s comments, which he described as having &quot;always been [Labor&#x27;s] position&quot;, saw Labor&#x27;s policy move closer to Liberal policy, insofar as Labor would ratify the agreement only after persuading all major carbon emitters, developing and developed, to ratify. Rudd also committed Labor to a target of a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020, a 5-point increase on the Liberal target, assisted by the use of renewable energy, but without the use of coal pollution mitigation, arguing that it would ultimately be a benefit, not a detriment to the economy.

===Week 3===
John Howard said the Coalition would not match Labor&#x27;s promise of 20 per cent renewable energy target. Howard claimed Labor&#x27;s policy &quot;imposes too many additional costs to industry&quot;. Peter Garrett replied that lack of government action has cost jobs. ABC Radio reported that Howard had rejected a 2005 recommendation for higher renewable energy targets by his Environment Minister, but Howard declined to confirm or deny the claim.

The Coalition announced a promise to open 50 new emergency medical centres on Australia if re-elected. Adding to the campaign trend of both major parties criticising their opponent for plagiarism and &quot;me-tooism&quot;, Labor responded that the government had copied its policy.

Peter Garrett was criticised by the Coalition when radio announcer Steve Price revealed Garrett had said to TV presenter Richard Wilkins that, &quot;once we get in we&#x27;ll just change it all&quot; in reference to copying Coalition policies. Garrett said the comment was made during a &quot;short, jocular and casual&quot; conversation and Wilkins supported Garrett&#x27;s response, saying that it was a &quot;light-hearted throwaway line&quot;.

Tim Costello, director of World Vision Australia and Peter Costello&#x27;s brother, criticised Australia&#x27;s ranking of 19th out of 22 OECD countries for provision of overseas aid, and for government unwillingness to increase its policy of 0.35 per cent of national GDP to match Labor&#x27;s commitment of 0.5 per cent. Howard said his party planned to lift the rate to 3.5 per cent.

Commentators pronounced Peter Costello and Wayne Swan&#x27;s debate on 30 October as ending in a draw. Costello focused mainly on the government&#x27;s past record, advocating the need for Australia to build into the future, while Swan said Labor were interested in &quot;investing in people&quot;. Howard said he believed Costello &quot;creamed&quot; his opponent, while Rudd said Swan did a &quot;fantastic job&quot;.

Liberal Tony Abbott and Labor&#x27;s Nicola Roxon debated health at the National Press Club on ABC television. Abbott&#x27;s character and ministerial capacity were questioned by Roxon for his comments about terminally ill asbestos campaigner Bernie Banton and for arriving 35 minutes late to debate. At the end of the debate, Roxon suggested to Abbott that he &quot;could have arrived on time&quot; if he had &quot;really wanted to&quot;, to which Abbott replied &quot;bullshit&quot;. Former Liberal campaign strategist Sue Cato said &quot;you just don&#x27;t run late for things like that&quot;. Abbott apologised to Banton but not to Roxon.

===Week 4===

On 10 November, the Australian Democrats held their campaign launch in Melbourne under the banner of &quot;Bring Back Balance&quot;, a reference to their central campaign theme of preventing the government from regaining absolute control of the Senate.

The Reserve Bank of Australia adjusted interest rates upwards by another 0.25 per cent, the sixth rise since the last election, to a 10-year high of 6.75 per cent, and the first time the Bank had been changed rates during an election campaign. The Coalition said that only the current government had the proper experienced team to manage the economy in future, less prosperous years. Costello argued that the inflationary reasons for the rate rise were &quot;outside the control of a Government&quot;. In response, Labor accused the Coalition of having &quot;hauled up the white flag in the fight against inflation&quot;, saying that they had backflipped from their past statements that they could keep interest rates low. Howard stated that he was sorry for the negative consequences for and burden on Australian borrowers, but subsequently denied that this constituted an apology for the rate rise itself.

On 7 November, Workplace Relations Minister Joe Hockey and Labor&#x27;s Julia Gillard debated industrial relations including WorkChoices at the National Press Club in Canberra. Hockey argued that Labor&#x27;s policy to drop Workchoices was Australia&#x27;s biggest threat to inflation.
On 8 November, Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull and opposition spokesman Peter Garrett debated environment issues at the National Press Club in Canberra. Garrett criticised the government&#x27;s record on climate change to which Turnbull responded that Garrett&#x27;s current claims betray his previous career as a political activist.

===Week 5===

Both major parties had their official campaign launches in Brisbane, Queensland; the Liberal Party on Monday 12 November and Labor on Wednesday 14 November. At their launch, the Coalition pledged a rebate for education costs, including private school fees, of all Australian children, totalling $9.4 billion. Under the plan, primary school students would have been eligible for $400, while secondary-school students would have been eligible for $800. Tax cuts worth $1.6 billion over four years were proposed to encourage people to save for first homes, and extra funding of $652 million for child care and $158 million to support carers was promised.

The Labor Party promised to spend only a quarter of the $9.4 billion promised by the Coalition, saying it would have a smaller impact on inflation. It accused the Howard government of being &quot;irresponsible&quot;. In addition to previous education funding announcements, Rudd promised Labor would provide an additional 65,000 apprenticeships, migrate all schools to new high speed broadband, and provide all year 9–12 students with access to their own computer. A doubling of the number of undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships available at a tertiary level was announced, and the party re-iterating its view on climate change and WorkChoices.

The Labor Party released footage on Thursday 15 November to Lateline, showing Tony Abbott addressing a room of people, stating &quot;I accept that certain protections, in inverted commas, are not what they were&quot; in reference to WorkChoices legislation. Referring to award structures, Abbott said in the same footage: &quot;I accept that that has largely gone. I accept that.&quot; When questioned, Abbott said he stood by the comments that WorkChoices means &quot;certain protections&quot; are not what they used to be, but denied conceding workers had lost protections. He said the video released by Labor was a &quot;cut-and-paste job&quot;.

A report by the National Audit Office found that the Coalition had been interfering in the $328 million regional grants program, with a bias toward their marginal seats, where projects under the Regional Partnerships Program were apparently approved without proper assessment, or none at all, and that there was an increase in approvals prior to the 2004 election.

===Week 6===
Newspoll stated Labor&#x27;s two-party-preferred level was down one point to 54 per cent. Former Liberal Party campaign director Lynton Crosby said that the Coalition was &quot;closing in on Labor&quot; in the final week and could &quot;still win a tight election&quot; on a campaign of defending marginal seats, declaring a win still possible on 48.5 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote.

On 20 November, John Howard defended the government&#x27;s advertising spending in the months prior to the campaign, paid for with public money. The advertising, which covered topics including the controversial &quot;Workchoices&quot;, cost $360 million over approximately 18 months. An article in the 20 November issue of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; suggested spending could have been up to $500 million, though this took a broader view of what was included in that sum. Howard was criticised for not revealing documents written by his department about further changes to industrial relations laws in addition to WorkChoices legislation. In response, the government said the proposals had been cancelled, and that WorkChoices would not be expanded upon. The Seven Network failed in attempt to access the documents under Freedom of Information.
Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce said that the possibility of his crossing the floor to support Labor&#x27;s amendments to WorkChoices remained open, and that he would judge all legislation on its merits, for which he was criticised by Nationals leader Mark Vaile.

On 21 November, three days before the election, fake pamphlets were distributed in the electorate of Lindsay, which purported to be from an Islamic group. The group was non-existent and the pamphlets thanked the Labor Party for supporting the Bali bombers and encouraged people to vote Labor. Those involved included a member of the Liberals&#x27; state executive, Jeff Egan; Gary Clark, husband of retiring MP Jackie Kelly; and Greg Chijoff, the husband of Lindsay candidate Karen Chijoff. Kelly said the incident was a &quot;&quot;Chaser&quot;-style prank.&quot; John Howard condemned the statement. Egan and Greg Chijoff were immediately expelled from the Liberal Party a day before John Howard&#x27;s address to the Australian Press Club; although, Egan denied any wrongdoing. Court cases are progressing.

Citing a clause of the Constitution that states parliamentarians are not permitted to hold an &quot;office of profit under the crown&quot;, government frontbencher Andrew Robb said that up to 13 Labor candidates standing in the election may be ineligible for nomination. According to Robb, a &quot;search of public records&quot; indicated that the 13 candidates may have still been employed by government agencies, boards or offices, and that the Liberal Party may consider legal challenges to their election. According to Labor Senator Penny Wong, all Labor&#x27;s candidates were eligible to stand, and that the Liberals had obtained the information from outdated websites.

Election day was Saturday 24 November.

==Television coverage==
Election night was covered extensively by three of the Australian free-to-air networks, from the National Tally Room: ABC Television, the Nine Network and the Seven Network. Network Ten and SBS Television included brief updates and news bulletins through the night, but not to the other networks&#x27; extent. Sky News offered extensive coverage on Pay TV.

*Seven went with a new election coverage team for 2007, led by Sunrise hosts David Koch and Melissa Doyle, who were assisted by journalist Mark Riley and game show host Andrew O&#x27;Keefe. Special guests included Liberal politicians Joe Hockey, Jackie Kelly, Andrew Robb and former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, Labor politicians Tanya Plibersek, Mark Arbib and former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, and National politician Barnaby Joyce. The broadcast was watched by 967,000 viewers, coming second after the ABC.
*Nine&#x27;s coverage was hosted by journalist Ray Martin and political editor Laurie Oakes. Special guests included Labor politicians Senator Robert Ray and Shadow Treasurer Wayne Swan, Liberals Michael Kroger and Communications Minister Helen Coonan. The broadcast was watched by 763,000 people and came third among the free-to-air networks doing full election count coverage.
*The ABC&#x27;s coverage was hosted by Kerry O&#x27;Brien, Tony Jones and Antony Green. Special guests included Senator Nick Minchin (Finance Minister), representing the Coalition, and Julia Gillard (Deputy Labor Leader). The ABC provided live crosses to key electorates around Australia. The broadcast was watched by 1,112,000 viewers and was the most watched election coverage.
* Sky News Australia&#x27;s coverage was hosted by David Speers in Sydney with Helen Dalley at the tally room in Canberra. Guests included former prime minister Bob Hawke, former Labor Leader Kim Beazley, former Liberal Leader John Hewson, and current members in Parliament, including Brendan Nelson and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells from the Liberal Party, Natasha Stott Despoja from the Democrats, Christine Milne from The Greens and Stephen Conroy and Tony Burke from the Labor Party. Party strategists Bruce Hawker and Lynton Crosby analysed the figures from the Sky News Centre in Sydney.

* Ten News covered the results in a special news bulletin airing about 10:30 pm. Anchored by Bill Woods and Paul Bongiorno in Canberra, and featuring Sandra Sully with Kevin Rudd in Brisbane, Deborah Knight with John Howard in Sydney, and Helen Kapalos with Peter Costello in Victoria. The network had heavily advertised that they would be airing The Empire Strikes Back as an alternative to the coverage on the other networks.
*SBS aired a results bulletin at 9:30 pm, anchored by Stan Grant alongside Canberra correspondent Karen Middleton.

==Polling==

Roy Morgan, Newspoll, ACNeilsen and Galaxy timegraph polling showed Labor leading the Coalition in opinion polling from mid-2006 onward. On several key questions, Labor increased its lead after Rudd assumed the Labor leadership from Kim Beazley, at which point Rudd also assumed the lead as preferred prime minister. While Labor was ahead in opinion polling, Howard had led Beazley on this question by a wide margin.

According to Australian political analyst Adam Carr, WorkChoices was one of five key reasons for &quot;...a change of heart by the decisive sectors of the electorate&quot;. The new industrial relations program, Carr said, angered the &quot;Howard battlers&quot; – the traditional Labor voters who had supported Howard for most of the last 11 years – because they saw it as a direct attack on their livelihood.

ACNielsen polling in March 2007 had Rudd&#x27;s personal approval rating at 67 per cent, which made him the most popular opposition leader in the poll&#x27;s 35-year history, with Newspoll (News Limited) 2PP polling the highest in its history at 61%. The largest 2PP election result for the ALP in its history was at the 1943 election on an estimate of 58.2 per cent.

A weighted collaboration of all polling since Rudd assumed the ALP leadership shows an average Labor 2PP figure of 57 per cent compared with the Coalition&#x27;s 43 per cent, and Rudd&#x27;s consistent outpolling of Howard as preferred prime minister, something not achieved under previous leaders Mark Latham, Kim Beazley or Simon Crean.

By the time the writs were issued, the Coalition was well behind Labor in opinion polling, which election analyst Antony Green believed to show Labor winning government &quot;in a canter&quot;. According to Green, this was a nearly exact reversal of the run-up to the 1996 election. The Coalition was running ahead of Labor in two-party opinion polling for much of 1995 and 1996, however the mantle of preferred prime minister regularly switched between Howard and Paul Keating.

Possums Pollytics, an anonymous weblog, stated that due to the uneven nature of the swings, where safe Liberal seats were swinging up to 14.6 per cent with safe Labor seats swinging around only 4.1 points, the Labor party stood to potentially end up with a maximum of 106 of the 151 lower house seats.

Polling consistently showed that the economy and national security were the Coalition&#x27;s strong areas. In August 2007 an Ipsos poll showed 39 per cent of voters thought Labor was a better economic manager, compared to 36 per cent for the Coalition, with 25 per cent undecided.

The morning of the election announcement, a special Sun-Herald Taverner survey of 979 people across New South Wales and Victoria had been released, indicating a Labor 2PP of 59 per cent, with the 18- to 29-year-old category voting at 72 per cent. The fortnightly Newspoll was released the day after the election was called, showing the 2PP remaining steady at Labor 56–44 Liberal. Howard increased his Preferred PM rating up one per cent to 39 per cent, while Rudd increased his rating up one per cent to 48 per cent. On the day after the election was called, Centrebet had odds of 1.47 on Labor, with 2.70 on the Coalition. Halfway through the campaign, with no overall change in the polls, saw Centrebet odds for Labor shorten to 1.29, with the Liberals on 3.60. Centrebet odds two days out from the election were at 1.22 for Labor, with 4.35 for the Coalition.

Newspoll a week out from the election of 3,600 voters in 18 of the Coalition&#x27;s most marginal seats revealed an ALP 54–46 Coalition 2PP, a swing to Labor of 6–9 per cent. A uniform swing would see 18–25 seats fall to Labor, The Australian said.

Former Labor number-cruncher Graham Richardson, who news.com.au (News Limited) claims to have correctly picked the winner of every election for the past three decades, tipped Kevin Rudd and Labor to win with a 6–7 per cent two-party-preferred, 20-seat swing.

The election-eve Newspoll and Galaxy poll reported the ALP on a 2PP of 52 per cent, Roy Morgan on 53.5 per cent, with ACNielsen on 57 per cent. Seven News reported that TAB had updated their odds for the election, with Labor having safe odds of $1.20 and the Coalition an outside chance on $4.60.

Sky News-Channel 7-Auspoll exit polls on election day of 2,787 voters in the 31 most marginal seats suggested a 53 per cent two-party preferred figure to Labor, 53 per cent to Labor in Bennelong, and 58 per cent to Labor in Eden-Monaro. Key issue questions swung Labor&#x27;s way.

===House of Representatives ===



At 8.00 pm, the first personality to call the election was former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke on Sky News. At 10.29 pm AEST, approximately two hours after the last polls in Western Australia closed, Liberal deputy leader Peter Costello conceded that the Coalition had lost government. At 10.36 pm, John Howard delivered a speech at the Sofitel Sydney Wentworth to concede defeat. At 11.05 pm, Kevin Rudd delivered his victory speech.

Labor won 83 of the 150 seats in the incoming House of Representatives. This represented a 23-seat swing to Labor. The Liberals won 55 while the Nationals won 10, with two seats retained by Independents. Labor finished with a 52.70 per cent two-party-preferred vote, a 5.44-point swing from 2004. On preferences, 79.7 per cent of Green votes flowed to Labor, 60.3 per cent of Family First votes flowed to the Coalition, with 62.5 per cent of Democrat votes flowing to Labor. Considering two-party estimates going back to the 1949 election, the swing to Labor in 2007 was the fourth-largest two-party-preferred swing, behind John Curtin and Labor in 1943 on 7.9 per cent, Malcolm Fraser and the Coalition in 1975 on 7.4 per cent, and Gough Whitlam and Labor in 1969 on 7.1 per cent. The swing was the largest since 1983, when full preference counting was introduced to create an exact two-party figure, and the largest swing to occur in the absence of a recession, political or military crisis.

Western Australia went against the national trend, with the Liberals suffering only a 2.14-point swing against them – lower than all except Tasmania and the ACT – but yet gaining one net seat. The weaker Labor performance was attributed to the strong economy and voters&#x27; unwillingness to do anything which might risk their present prosperity – a sentiment played to by Liberal campaigning strategies – and also the behaviour of union officials Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald who had made headlines during the campaign.

As of 2024, The 2007 election was the last time the National party received over 5% of the vote for the House of Representatives.

===Senate ===

Labor and the Coalition won 18 seats each in the half-Senate election. The Greens won three seats, with Independent Nick Xenophon being elected on primary votes alone. This took the 76-member Senate total to 37 Coalition, 32 Labor, 5 Green, 1 Family First, and 1 Independent. With a majority being 39 senators, when the new Senate met after 1 July 2008, the balance of power was shared between Xenophon, Family First&#x27;s Steve Fielding and the five Greens. Xenophon, although reported as left-of-centre, indicated plans to work closely with the renegade National, Senator Barnaby Joyce. If sufficient Coalition senators voted for government legislation, support from the crossbench was not required.

Xenophon&#x27;s election was at the expense of a Liberal candidate, without his presence the Coalition would have held enough Senate seats to block legislation.

Compared to the previous Senate, the Greens gained one (losing Kerry Nettle in NSW but gaining Sarah Hanson-Young in SA and Scott Ludlam in WA), a new Independent was elected (Xenophon), and Labor gained four seats. The Coalition lost two, and the Democrats lost all four of their seats.

The informal rate of 2.55 per cent ties with the 1993 election as the lowest informal rate in the Senate since federation. The introduction of the group voting ticket at the 1984 election saw the number of informal votes drop dramatically.

==Defeat of the Prime Minister==
Prime Minister John Howard lost his own seat of Bennelong, in Northern Sydney, to Labor candidate and former journalist Maxine McKew, becoming the second sitting prime minister, and the third party leader, since Federation to be defeated in his own electorate. Prime Minister Stanley Bruce and National Party leader Charles Blunt lost their seats in 1929 and 1990 respectively. Howard had held the seat since 1974, and it had been in Liberal hands ever since its creation in 1949.

However, successive redistributions, along with demographic change, had made the once safe Liberal seat much friendlier to Labor; much of the area was represented by Labor at the state level. Howard&#x27;s two-party majority was four percent, putting it right on the edge of seats that Labor would likely take in the event it won.

Late on election night, when conceding Labor had won government, Howard also acknowledged the likelihood he had lost Bennelong to McKew, though he and McKew agreed the margin was &quot;very tight&quot;. He had been ahead by thin margins for most of the night, never leading by more than 0.2 percentage points. Howard had been 206 votes ahead of McKew on the first count, and finished 2.8 percentage points behind McKew on the estimated two-party vote. McKew declined to claim victory at first, saying that the seat was on &quot;a knife edge,&quot; while the Australian Broadcasting Corporation listed Bennelong as a Labor gain on election night, and ABC election analyst Antony Green said there was &quot;no doubt&quot; McKew had won.

On 29 November, Rudd named McKew as a parliamentary secretary (assistant minister) to be appointed on 3 December, and on 1 December, McKew claimed victory. Although counting was incomplete at the time, with several postal and absentee ballots outstanding, it was expected that Howard would not win enough of the votes to retain his seat. McKew finished with a primary vote of 45.33 per cent, and a two-party-preferred vote of 51.40 per cent, a 5.53-point swing from 2004. Howard lost on the 14th count due to a large flow of Green preferences to McKew. This swing was within the redistributed boundaries after the 2004 election.

Three other Howard ministers were defeated – Mal Brough, Gary Nairn and Jim Lloyd.

==Seats changing hands==

The following table indicates seats that changed hands from one party to another at this election. It compares the election results with the previous margins, taking into account the redistribution in New South Wales and Queensland. As a result, it includes the newly created electorate of Flynn, and the existing Parramatta, which was retained by Labor despite becoming a notional Liberal seat due to boundary changes. The table does not include Gwydir, which was abolished in the redistribution; Macquarie, which was reclassified from safe Liberal to marginal Labor and was subsequently won by Labor; or Calare, the seat of Independent MP Peter Andren, which was reclassified as a National seat by the redistribution and was won by the National Party.
* Members listed in italics did not contest their seats at this election.

==Aftermath==

The Labor caucus met on Thursday 29 November 2007 to confirm the First Rudd Ministry, which was sworn in on 3 December. In a departure from Labor tradition, the ministry was selected by Kevin Rudd as the prime minister, rather than by Caucus.

Given John Howard&#x27;s personal defeat, the Liberal Party began the process of choosing a new leader. The morning after the election, Peter Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, and long regarded as Howard&#x27;s natural successor, stated that he would not run for Liberal leadership. The day before the ballot, former Health Minister Tony Abbott withdrew from the leadership after initially indicating he would stand. The leadership ballot was held on Thursday 29 November. The previous Defence Minister Brendan Nelson and former Environmental Minister Malcolm Turnbull both stood for the leadership. Former Education Minister Julie Bishop contested the deputy leadership position, as did Andrew Robb and Christopher Pyne.

Brendan Nelson was elected leader by 45 votes to 42, and Julie Bishop was elected deputy leader. A Newspoll survey taken after the Liberal leadership change revealed a preferred-prime-minister rating of Rudd 61 per cent to Nelson 14 per cent, with Turnbull twice as popular as Nelson. Newspoll&#x27;s subsequent polling saw new Newspoll records set, at 70 per cent for the best rating for preferred prime minister, to 9 per cent for the worst rating for preferred prime minister, with the next poll results revealing another record of 73 to 7 per cent. A new two party preferred record was also set, at 63 to 37 per cent Labor&#x27;s way.

Post-election, ALP secretary Tim Gartrell commented on pre-election campaign billboard ads featuring a picture of John Howard stating &quot;Working families in Australia have never been better off&quot;, which looked like Liberal Party advertisements, were actually paid for by the Labor Party. Liberal leader Brendan Nelson declared that the Liberal Party had listened and learned from the Australian public and declared WorkChoices &quot;dead&quot;.

In 2008, former ministers Peter McGauran, Alexander Downer, and Mark Vaile resigned from parliament, sparking Gippsland, Mayo, and Lyne by-elections. The Lyne by-election resulted in independent Rob Oakeshott being elected, reducing the total number of Coalition seats to 64. Bradfield and Higgins by-elections were held in December 2009.

In September 2008, Malcolm Turnbull replaced Brendan Nelson in a leadership spill, and Barnaby Joyce replaced CLP Senator and Nationals deputy leader Nigel Scullion as leader of the Nationals in the Senate, and moved the party to the crossbenches. Joyce stated that his party would no longer necessarily vote with their Liberal counterparts in the upper house.

<text>Experimental film or avant-garde cinema is a mode of filmmaking that does not apply standard cinematic conventions, instead adopting non-narrative forms or alternatives to traditional narratives or methods of working. Many experimental films, particularly early ones, relate to arts in other disciplines: painting, dance, literature and poetry, or arise from research and development of new technical resources.

While some experimental films have been distributed through mainstream channels or even made within commercial studios, the vast majority have been produced on very low budgets with a minimal crew or a single person and are either self-financed or supported through small grants.

Experimental filmmakers generally begin as amateurs, and some use experimental films as a springboard into commercial film-making or transition into academic positions. The aim of experimental filmmaking may be to render the personal vision of an artist, or to promote interest in new technology rather than to entertain or to generate revenue, as is the case with commercial films.

==Definition==
The term experimental film describes a range of filmmaking styles that frequently differ from, and are often opposed to, the practices of mainstream commercial and documentary filmmaking. &quot;Avant-garde&quot; is also used, for the films of the sort shot in the twenties in France, Germany or Russia, to describe this work, and &quot;underground&quot; was used in the sixties, though it has also had other connotations. Today the term &quot;experimental cinema&quot; prevails, because it&#x27;s possible to make experimental films without the presence of any avant-garde movement in the cultural field.

While &quot;experimental&quot; covers a wide range of practice, an experimental film is often characterized by the absence of linear narrative, the use of various abstracting techniques—out-of-focus, painting or scratching on film, rapid editing—the use of asynchronous (non-diegetic) sound or even the absence of any sound track. The goal is often to place the viewer in a more active and more thoughtful relationship to the film. At least through the 1960s, and to some extent after, many experimental films took an oppositional stance toward mainstream culture.

Most experimental films are made on very low budgets, self-financed or financed through small grants, with a minimal crew or, often a crew of only one person, the filmmaker. Some critics have argued that much experimental film is no longer in fact &quot;experimental&quot; but has in fact become a mainstream film genre. Many of its more typical features—such as a non-narrative, impressionistic, or poetic approaches to the film&#x27;s construction—define what is generally understood to be &quot;experimental&quot;.

==History of the European avant-garde==

===Beginnings===

In the 1920s, two conditions made Europe ready for the emergence of experimental film. First, the cinema matured as a medium, and highbrow resistance to the mass entertainment began to wane. Second, avant-garde movements in the visual arts flourished. The Dadaists and Surrealists in particular took to cinema. René Clair&#x27;s &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; (1924) featuring Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, and Man Ray, and with music by Erik Satie, took madcap comedy into nonsequitur.

Artists Hans Richter, Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, Germaine Dulac, and Viking Eggeling all contributed Dadaist/Surrealist shorts. Fernand Léger, Dudley Murphy, and Man Ray created the film &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; (1924), which has been described as Dadaist, Cubist, or Futurist. Duchamp created the abstract film &quot;Anémic Cinéma&quot; (1926).

Alberto Cavalcanti directed &quot;Rien que les heures&quot; (1926), Walter Ruttmann directed &quot;&quot; (1927), and Dziga Vertov filmed &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; (1929), experimental &quot;city symphonies&quot; of Paris, Berlin, and Kiev, respectively.

One famous experimental film is Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí&#x27;s &quot;Un chien andalou&quot; (1929). Hans Richter&#x27;s animated shorts, Oskar Fischinger&#x27;s abstract films, and Len Lye&#x27;s GPO films are examples of more abstract European avant-garde films.

===France===
Working in France, another group of filmmakers also financed films through patronage and distributed them through cine-clubs, yet they were narrative films not tied to an avant-garde school. Film scholar David Bordwell has dubbed these French Impressionists and included Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Marcel L&#x27;Herbier, and Dimitri Kirsanoff. These films combine narrative experimentation, rhythmic editing and camerawork, and an emphasis on character subjectivity.

In 1952, the Lettrists avant-garde movement, in France, caused riots at the Cannes Film Festival, when Isidore Isou&#x27;s &quot;Traité de bave et d&#x27;éternité&quot; (also known as &quot;Venom and Eternity&quot;) was screened. After their criticism of Charlie Chaplin at the 1952 press conference in Paris for Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot;, there was a split within the movement. The Ultra-Lettrists continued to cause disruptions when they announced the death of cinema and showed their new hypergraphical techniques; the most notorious example is Guy Debord&#x27;s &quot;Howlings in favor of de Sade&quot; (&quot;Hurlements en Faveur de Sade&quot;) from 1952.

===Soviet Union===

The Soviet filmmakers, too, found a counterpart to modernist painting and photography in their theories of montage. The films of Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Lev Kuleshov, Alexander Dovzhenko, and Vsevolod Pudovkin were instrumental in providing an alternative model from that offered by classical Hollywood. While not experimental films per se, they contributed to the film language of the avant-garde.

=== Italy ===
Italy had a historically difficult relationship with its avant-garde scene, although, the birth of cinema coincided with the emerging of Italian Futurism.

Potentially the new medium of cinema was a perfect match for the concerns of futurism, a renowned for promoting new aesthetics, motion, and modes of perception. Especially, given the futurist fascination with the sensation of speed and the dynamism of modern life. However, what is left of futurist cinema is mostly on paper, many films very lost, and other never got made. Amongst those literatures there are &quot;The Futurist Cinema&quot; (Marinetti et al., 1916), Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature (1912), The Variety Theatre (1913), The Futurist Synthetic Theatre (1915), and The New Religion – Morality of Speed (1916). Perhaps, the futurists were amongst the first avant-garde filmmakers group devoted to the potential of the image, praising motion and aiming towards an anti-narrative aesthetic. As an example, Marinetti&#x27;s quote: &quot;The cinema is an autonomous art. The cinema must therefore never copy the stage. The cinema, being essentially visual, must above all fulfil the evolution of painting, detach itself from reality, from photography, from the graceful and solemn...&quot; As exemplified in the quote, the image is the real subject, not the story or the acting, an approach and attitude that remain true for the whole history of experimental filmmaking.

Anton Giulio Bragaglia is undoubtedly the most known filmmaker from the futurist movement.

==Prewar and postwar American avant-garde: the birth of experimental cinema==
The United States had some avant-garde films before World War II, such as &quot;Manhatta&quot; (1921), by Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand, and &quot;The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra&quot; (1928), by Slavko Vorkapich and Robert Florey. However, much pre-war experimental film culture consisted of artists working, often in isolation, on film projects. In the early 1930s, Painter Emlen Etting (1905–1993) directed dance films that are considered experimental. Commercial artist (&quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;) and illustrator Douglass Crockwell (1904–1968) made animations with blobs of paint pressed between sheets of glass in his studio at Glens Falls, New York.

In Rochester, New York, medical doctor and philanthropist James Sibley Watson and Melville Webber directed &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (1928) and &quot;Lot in Sodom&quot; (1933). Harry Smith, Mary Ellen Bute, artist Joseph Cornell, and Christopher Young made several European-influenced experimental films. Smith and Bute were both influenced by Oskar Fischinger, as were many avant garde animators and filmmakers. In 1930, the magazine &quot;Experimental Cinema&quot; appeared. The editors were Lewis Jacobs and David Platt. In October 2005, a large collection of films of that period were restored and re-released on DVD, titled &quot;Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894-1941&quot;.

With Slavko Vorkapich, John Hoffman made two visual tone poems, &quot;Moods of the Sea&quot; (aka &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;, 1941) and &quot;Forest Murmurs&quot; (1947). The former film is set to Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Hebrides Overture&quot; and was restored in 2004 by film preservation expert David Shepard.
&quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943) by Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid is an early American experimental film. It provided a model for self-financed 16 mm production and distribution, one that was soon picked up by Cinema 16 and other film societies. Just as importantly, it established an aesthetic model of what experimental cinema could do. &quot;Meshes&quot; had a dream-like feel that hearkened to Jean Cocteau and the Surrealists, but equally seemed personal, new and American. Early works by Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Shirley Clarke, Gregory Markopoulos, Jonas Mekas, Willard Maas, Marie Menken, Curtis Harrington, Sidney Peterson, Lionel Rogosin, and Earle M. Pilgrim followed in a similar vein. Significantly, many of these filmmakers were the first students from the pioneering university film programs established in Los Angeles and New York. In 1946, Frank Stauffacher started the &quot;Art in Cinema&quot; series of experimental films at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where Oskar Fischinger&#x27;s films were featured in several special programs, influencing artists such as Jordan Belson and Harry Smith to make experimental animation.

They set up &quot;alternative film programs&quot; at Black Mountain College (now defunct) and the San Francisco Art Institute. Arthur Penn taught at Black Mountain College, which points out the popular misconception in both the art world and Hollywood that the avant-garde and the commercial never meet. Another challenge to that misconception is that late in life, after their Hollywood careers had ended, both Nicholas Ray and King Vidor made avant-garde films.

Film theorist P. Adams Sitney offers a concept of &quot;visionary film&quot;, and he invented a few genre categories, including the mythopoetic film, the structural film, the trance film and the participatory film, in order 
to describe the historical morphology of experimental cinema in the American avant-garde from 1943 to the 2000s.

=== The New American Cinema and structural film ===

The film society and self-financing model continued over the next two decades, but by the early 1960s, a different outlook became perceptible in the work of American avant-garde filmmakers. Filmmakers like Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Ken Jacobs, Paul Sharits, Tony Conrad, and Ernie Gehr, are considered by P. Adams Sitney to be key models for what he calls &quot;structural film&quot;. Sitney says that the key elements of structural film are a fixed camera position, flicker effect, re-photography off screen, and loop printing. As Sitney has pointed out, in the work of Stan Brakhage and other American experimentalists of early period, film is used to express the individual consciousness of the maker, a cinematic equivalent of the first person in literature. Brakhage&#x27;s &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; (1961–64) exemplified a shift from personal confessional to abstraction, and also evidenced a rejection of American mass culture of the time. On the other hand, Kenneth Anger added a rock sound track to his &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; (1963) in what is sometimes said to be an anticipation of music videos, and included some camp commentary on Hollywood mythology. Jack Smith and Andy Warhol incorporated camp elements into their work, and Sitney posited Warhol&#x27;s connection to structural film.

Some avant-garde filmmakers moved further away from narrative as artist Bruce Conner created his early examples such as &quot;A Movie&quot; (1958) and &quot;Cosmic Ray&quot; (1962). Whereas the New American Cinema was marked by an oblique take on narrative, one based on abstraction, camp and minimalism, structural filmmakers like Frampton and Snow created a highly formalist cinema that foregrounded the medium itself: the frame, projection, and most importantly, time. It has been argued that by breaking film down into bare components, they sought to create an anti-illusionist cinema, although Frampton&#x27;s late works owe a huge debt to the photography of Edward Weston, Paul Strand, and others, and in fact celebrate illusion. Further, while many filmmakers began making rather academic &quot;structural films&quot; following &quot;Film Culture&quot;&#x27;s publication of an article by P. Adams Sitney in the late 1960s, many of the filmmakers named in the article objected to the term.

A critical review of the structuralists appeared in a 2000 edition of the art journal &quot;Art in America&quot;. It examined structural-formalism as a conservative philosophy of filmmaking.

===The 1960–70s and today: Time arts in the conceptual art landscape===
In the 1970s, Conceptual art pushed even further. Robert Smithson, a California-based artist, made several films about his earthworks and attached projects. Yoko Ono made conceptual films. The most notorious of these is &quot;Rape,&quot; which centers on a woman&#x27;s life being invaded with cameras, as she attempts to flee. Around this time, a new generation was entering the field, many of whom were students of the early avant-gardists. Leslie Thornton, Peggy Ahwesh, and Su Friedrich expanded upon the work of the structuralists, incorporating a broader range of content while maintaining a self-reflexive form.

Andy Warhol, the man behind Pop Art and a variety of other oral and art forms, made over 60 films throughout the 1960s, most of them experimental. In more recent years, filmmakers such as Craig Baldwin and James O&#x27;Brien (&quot;Hyperfutura&quot;) have made use of stock footage married to live action narratives in a form of mash-up cinema that has strong socio-political undertones. Chris Marker&#x27;s &quot;La Jetée&quot; (1962) consists almost entirely of still photographs accompanied by narration, while Jonás Cuarón&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Nail&quot; (2007) uses unstaged photographs which the director took of his friends and family combined with voice acting to tell a fictional story. Other examples of films created in the 21st century with this technique are Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot; and David Lynch&#x27;s filmography.

Animated films in the 21st century such as Don Hertzfeldt&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Beautiful Day&quot;, a 2012 American comedy-drama film, and Frederick C.G. Borromeo&#x27;s film debut &quot;Distortion&quot;, a 2023 non-narrative film made in RPG Maker engine, are landmark examples of experimental animated films.

===Feminist avant-garde and other political offshoots===
Laura Mulvey&#x27;s writing and filmmaking launched a flourishing of feminist filmmaking based on the idea that conventional Hollywood narrative reinforced gender norms and a patriarchal gaze. Their response was to resist narrative in a way to show its fissures and inconsistencies. Chantal Akerman and Sally Potter are just two of the leading feminist filmmakers working in this mode in the 1970s. Video art emerged as a medium in this period, and feminists like Martha Rosler and Cecelia Condit took full advantage of it.

In the 1980s feminist, gay and other political experimental work continued, with filmmakers like Barbara Hammer, Su Friedrich, Tracey Moffatt, Sadie Benning and Isaac Julien among others finding experimental format conducive to their questions about identity politics.

The queercore movement gave rise to a number experimental queer filmmakers such as G.B. Jones (a founder of the movement) in the 1990s and later Scott Treleaven, among others.

===Experimental film in universities===
With very few exceptions, Curtis Harrington among them, the artists involved in these early movements remained outside the mainstream commercial cinema and entertainment industry. A few taught occasionally, and then, starting in 1966, many became professors at universities such as the State Universities of New York, Bard College, California Institute of the Arts, the Massachusetts College of Art, University of Colorado at Boulder, and the San Francisco Art Institute.

Many experimental-film practitioners do not in fact possess college degrees themselves, although their showings are prestigious. Some have questioned the status of the films made in the academy, but longtime film professors such as Stan Brakhage, Ken Jacobs, Ernie Gehr, and many others, continued to refine and expand their practice while teaching. The inclusion of experimental film in film courses and standard film histories, however, has made the work more widely known and more accessible.

==Exhibition and distribution==
Beginning in 1946, Frank Stauffacher ran the &quot;Art in Cinema&quot; program of experimental and avant-garde films at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

From 1949 to 1975, the —located in Knokke-Heist, Belgium—was the most prominent festival of experimental cinema in the world. It permits the discovery of American avant-garde in 1958 with Brakhage&#x27;s films and many others European and American filmmakers.

From 1947 to 1963, the New York-based Cinema 16 functioned as the primary exhibitor and distributor of experimental film in the United States. Under the leadership of Amos Vogel and Marcia Vogel, Cinema 16 flourished as a nonprofit membership society committed to the exhibition of documentary, avant-garde, scientific, educational, and performance films to ever-increasing audiences.

In 1962, Jonas Mekas and about 20 other film makers founded The Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative in New York City. Soon similar artists cooperatives were formed in other places: Canyon Cinema in San Francisco, the London Film-Makers&#x27; Co-op, and Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Center.

Following the model of Cinema 16, experimental films have been exhibited mainly outside of commercial theaters in small film societies, microcinemas, museums, art galleries, archives and film festivals.

Several other organizations, in both Europe and North America, helped develop experimental film. These included Anthology Film Archives in New York City, The Millennium Film Workshop, the British Film Institute in London, the National Film Board of Canada and the Collective for Living Cinema.

Some of the more popular film festivals, such as Ann Arbor Film Festival, the New York Film Festival&#x27;s &quot;Views from the Avant-Garde&quot; Side Bar, the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and Media City Film Festival prominently feature experimental works.

The New York Underground Film Festival, Chicago Underground Film Festival, the LA Freewaves Experimental Media Arts Festival, MIX NYC the New York Experimental Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, and Toronto&#x27;s Images Festival also support this work and provide venues for films which would not otherwise be seen. There is some dispute about whether &quot;underground&quot; and &quot;avant-garde&quot; truly mean the same thing and if challenging non-traditional cinema and fine arts cinema are actually fundamentally related.

Venues such as Anthology Film Archives, San Francisco Cinematheque, Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California, Tate Modern, London and the Centre Pompidou in Paris often include historically significant experimental films and contemporary works. Screening series no longer in New York that featured experimental work include the Robert Beck Memorial Cinema, Ocularis and the Collective for Living Cinema.

All these associations and movements have permitted the birth and development of national experimental films and schools like &quot;body cinema&quot; (&quot;Écoles du corps&quot; or &quot;Cinéma corporel&quot;) and &quot;post-structural&quot; movements in France, and &quot;structural/materialism&quot; in England for example.

==Influences on mainstream commercial media==
Though experimental film is known to a relatively small number of practitioners, academics and connoisseurs, it has influenced and continues to influence cinematography, visual effects and editing.

Experimental film reached mainstream audiences at world exhibitions, especially those in Montreal, Expo 67, and Osaka, Expo 70.

The genre of music video can be seen as a commercialization of many techniques of experimental film. Title design and television advertising have also been influenced by experimental film.

Many experimental filmmakers have also made feature films, and vice versa.

<doc id="1056090" wikidata="Q2658401" url="?curid=1056090" title="Fatality (Mortal Kombat)">
<text>Fatality is a gameplay feature in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game series, in which the victor of the match inflicts a brutally murderous finishing move onto their defeated opponent. Prompted by the announcer saying &quot;Finish Him&quot; or &quot;Finish Her&quot;, players have a short time window to execute a Fatality by entering specific commands while positioned at a specific distance from the opponent. The Fatality and its derivations are notable features of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series and have caused controversies.

==History==

The origins of the Fatality concept have been traced back to several violent Asian martial arts media. In &quot;The Street Fighter&quot; (1974), a Japanese martial arts film, Sonny Chiba performs x-ray fatality finishing moves, which at the time was seen as a gimmick to distinguish it from other martial arts films. In the Japanese shōnen manga and anime series &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, the protagonist Kenshiro performs gory fatalities in the form of finishing moves which consist of attacking pressure points that cause heads and bodies to explode. The Japanese seinen manga and anime series &quot;Riki-Oh&quot; (1988 debut), along with its Hong Kong martial arts film adaptation &quot;Story of Ricky&quot; (1991), featured gory fatalities in the form of finishing moves similar to those that later appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The nature of graphic violence depicted in Fatalities from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was considered highly controversial and contributed to the formation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), a regulatory system for video game content. The impression of Fatality inspired other video game franchises to have finishing moves, including &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, &quot;Gears of War&quot;, &quot;War Gods&quot;, and &quot;ClayFighter&quot;.

While creating &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Ed Boon and John Tobias started with the idea of a &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;-style system and retained many of its conventions but tweaked others. The most notable additions were graphic blood effects, more brutal fighting techniques, and especially the fatal finishing moves (this was a novelty as the traditional fighting games ended with the loser simply knocked unconscious and the victor posing for the players). According to Boon, it started with an idea to enable the player to hit a dizzied opponent at the end of the match with a &quot;free hit&quot;, and that idea &quot;quickly evolved into something nasty&quot;. However, Tobias recalled it differently, stating that Fatalities were not initially part of the game&#x27;s design. Early development focused on using a finishing move exclusively for the final boss, Shang Tsung, who was envisioned decapitating his opponent with a sword. This concept evolved when developers considered allowing players to perform similar finishing moves on their opponents. The positive reactions from players solidified Fatalities as a core mechanic of the game, leading to their prominence within the franchise. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), an accessibility feature for visually impaired individuals was made available, in which the properties of Fatalities are explained through in-game narration.

== Gameplay ==
Fatalities, like special moves, often have specific requirements. Each character has a unique Fatality that must be performed at a specific distance: close (right next to the opponent), sweep/mid (one or two steps away, within sweeping kick range), or far (about one jump&#x27;s length away).

=== Alternatives ===
*Animality: Allows a character to morph into an animal and maul their opponent. Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. According to Ed Boon, this finisher was rumored to be in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and was later added to &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; due to high fan demand.
*Babality: Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, it turns defeated opponents into an infant version of themselves.
*Brutality: Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, this involves a multi-hit combo that causes the opponent to explode. In the later games, Brutalities are tied to specific moves serving as finishing blows.
*Death Traps: Featured in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, allowing players to kill opponents using interactive stage elements, but unlike Stage Fatalities, they can be executed at any point of a match.
*Faction Kill: Appearing only in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, this finisher aligns with the game&#x27;s faction system, offering faction-themed finishing moves as a reward for allegiance to the respective faction.
*Fergality: The Sega Genesis version of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; featured an exclusive finishing move that allowed Raiden to transform his opponent into Probe Ltd. employee Fergus McGovern.
*Friendship: This finishing move is an alternative to Fatalities, used for ending a match in a friendly manner.
*Hara-Kiri: Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;. It is a finishing move in which a losing player kills themselves rather than being finished by their opponent.
*Heroic Brutality: This is exclusive to the 2008 crossover game &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. In addition to the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters&#x27; Fatalities toned down to maintain the game&#x27;s &quot;Teen&quot; rating, the Heroic Brutalities represented the DC characters&#x27; moral code against killing.
*Kreate-A-Fatality: For &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, the Fatality concept was completely revised, which focused more on combinations of attacks instead of character-specific finishers.
*Mercy: Allows players to spare opponents instead of finishing them.
*Multality: &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; features Multalities, which are Fatalities performed on multiple enemies simultaneously.
*Nudalities: Planned for &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, however, they were canceled by one of the game&#x27;s publishers, Williams Entertainment.
*Seasonal Fatality: This concept of Fatality was introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, in which the Fatalities are themed around a special festival. Examples include Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Christmas.
*Stage Fatality: It brought environmental interaction within the series, occurring when a player uses a part of the stage to kill an opponent. Some examples of Stage Fatalities are having the victim fall into a pool of acid or a pit of spikes or colliding with a subway train.
*Quitality: Introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, it occurs when a player disconnects during an online match. This results in losing a match and a character instantly dying or snapping their own neck.

==Notable Fatalities==

In December 1994, &quot;GamePro&quot; conducted a reader poll to determine the most popular Fatalities from &quot;MKII&quot;. The results, published in March 1995, highlighted Jax&#x27;s &quot;Arm Rip&quot;, Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Ice Grenade&quot;, and Shang Tsung&#x27;s &quot;Soul Stealer&quot; as fan favorites. Years later, in November 2008, &quot;GamePro&quot; Patrick Shaw ranked his &quot;12 Lamest Fatalities&quot; across various fighting games. Among those from the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series from least to highest ranking were Liu Kang&#x27;s &quot;Death by Arcade Machine&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;), The Flash&#x27;s &quot;Tornado Slam&quot; (&quot;MK vs. DCU&quot;), Jax&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Growing Man&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;), Scorpion&#x27;s and Rain&#x27;s Animalities (&quot;UMK3&quot;/&quot;MKT&quot;), Sindel&#x27;s &quot;Killer Hair&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;), Kano&#x27;s &quot;Stomach Pounce&quot; (&quot;MK vs. DCU&quot;), and the censored Super NES version of his &quot;Heart Rip&quot; Fatality from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

In May 2010, Dan Ryckert from &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewed the Fatalities, categorizing them into the best, worst, and most confusing. Best Fatalities: Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Spine Rip&quot; (&quot;MK&quot; 1992), Liu Kang&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&quot;, Reptile&#x27;s &quot;Head Snack&quot;, and Jax&#x27;s &quot;Arm Pull&quot; (all three from &quot;MKII&quot;); Sektor&#x27;s &quot;Compactor&quot; and Sindel&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;); Jade&#x27;s &quot;Head Gymnastics&quot; and Dairou&#x27;s &quot;Ribs to the Eyes&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;). Worst Fatalities: Liu Kang&#x27;s &quot;Cartwheel&quot; (&quot;MK&quot; 1992), Kitana&#x27;s &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;), Kabal&#x27;s &quot;Inflating Head&quot; and &quot;Scary Face&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;), Rain&#x27;s &quot;Upside-Down Uppercut&quot; (&quot;MKT&quot;), Bo&#x27; Rai Cho&#x27;s &quot;Fart of Doom&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;), and Kano&#x27;s &quot;Knee Stomp&quot; (&quot;MK vs. DCU&quot;). Confusing Fatalities: Johnny Cage&#x27;s &quot;Three Head Punch&quot;, Liu Kang&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Machine&quot;, Jax&#x27;s &quot;Giant Stomp&quot;, Cyrax&#x27;s &quot;Self-Destruct&quot;, Kano&#x27;s &quot;Skeleton Pull&quot;, and Smoke&#x27;s &quot;Blow Up The World&quot; (all six from &quot;MK3&quot;), and Darrius&#x27; &quot;Rearranger&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;).

In February 2011, &quot;UGO Entertainment&quot; K. Thor Jensen ranked the top 50 &quot;Most Gruesome Finishing Moves Ever&quot; in video games, with several &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; Fatalities making the list. The least to highest ranking Fatalities: Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Spine Rip&quot; (&quot;MK&quot; 1992), Johnny Cage&#x27;s &quot;Triple Uppercut&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;), the Joker&#x27;s &quot;Last Joke&quot; (&quot;MK vs. DCU&quot;), Kung Lao&#x27;s &quot;Hat Slice&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;), Johnny Cage&#x27;s &quot;Nutbuster&quot; (&quot;MKSM&quot;), the &quot;Pit&quot; Fatality, Sektor&#x27;s &quot;Iron Clamp&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;), Dairou&#x27;s &quot;Ribeyes&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;), and Smoke&#x27;s &quot;Armageddon&quot; (&quot;MK3&quot;). In April 2014, &quot;Prima Games&quot; Robert Workman compiled a list of the top 50 Fatalities. The order from top 10 to top 1 included Baraka&#x27;s &quot;Lifting Stab&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;), Noob Saibot&#x27;s &quot;Make a Wish&quot; (&quot;MK9&quot;), Kitana&#x27;s &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (&quot;MKII&quot;), Johnny Cage&#x27;s &quot;Nut Buster&quot; (&quot;MKSM&quot;), Ermac&#x27;s &quot;Mind Over Splatter&quot; (&quot;MK9&quot;), the &quot;Pit&quot; Fatality, Dairou&#x27;s &quot;Eye Stab&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;), Kung Lao&#x27;s &quot;Blade Drag&quot; (&quot;MK9&quot;), Kano&#x27;s &quot;Heart Rip&quot; and Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Beheading, Complete with Spine&quot; (&quot;MK&quot; 1992).

In May 2020, Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; selected his top 3 Fatalities from each &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game, spanning the series from its original release to &quot;MK11&quot;.

In October 2022, Justin Clark of &quot;GameSpot&quot; celebrated the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series by selecting the 10 best and worst Fatalities in its history. Among the best were Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Spine Rip&quot; (&quot;MK&quot; 1992), Kung Lao&#x27;s &quot;Hat Split&quot; and Shang Tsung&#x27;s Kintaro transformation (&quot;MKII&quot;), Quan Chi&#x27;s &quot;Shake a Leg&quot; (&quot;MK4&quot;), Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;The Pitch&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;), Scorpion&#x27;s &quot;Nether Gate&quot; (&quot;MK9&quot;), Ermac&#x27;s &quot;Inner Workings&quot; and Cassie Cage&#x27;s &quot;Selfie&quot; (&quot;MKX&quot;), Shang Tsung&#x27;s &quot;Kondemned to the Damned&quot; and D&#x27;Vorah&#x27;s &quot;New Species&quot; (&quot;MK11&quot;). The worst included Liu Kang&#x27;s &quot;Cartwheel Uppercut&quot; (&quot;MK&quot; 1992/&quot;MKII&quot;), Jade&#x27;s &quot;Shaky Staff&quot; and Classic Sub-Zero&#x27;s &quot;Blackout&quot; (&quot;UMK3&quot;), Quan Chi&#x27;s &quot;Neck Stretch&quot; (&quot;MKDA&quot;), Scorpion&#x27;s &quot;Only a Flesh Wound&quot; and Ashrah&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo Doll&quot; (&quot;MKD&quot;), &quot;Ultimate Fatalities&quot; (&quot;MKA&quot;), Kano&#x27;s &quot;Stomp, Drop, and Roll&quot; (&quot;MK vs. DCU&quot;), Cassie Cage&#x27;s &quot;I &lt;3 You&quot; and Skarlet&#x27;s &quot;Heart Condition&quot; (&quot;MK11&quot;). Fatalities from 2023&#x27;s &quot;MK1&quot; have drawn critical attention, including Liu Kang&#x27;s Fatality, where he transports his opponent to outer space and summons a black hole, and the &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; Fatality, described by &quot;Polygon&quot; Michael McWhertor as the &quot;most disgusting finishing move yet&quot;.

<text>Comedy Inc. was an Australian sketch comedy television series, which ran on the Nine Network from 19 February 2003 to 26 December 2007. The series was produced by Crackerjack Productions. It first premiered in February 2003 in the new wave of Australian sketch comedy shows being launched across the free-to-air channels along with &quot;Big Bite&quot; and &quot;skitHOUSE&quot;. Since the end of the series episodes have been repeated on the Foxtel cable channel, The Comedy Channel and during 2009, reruns were shown on Nine HD before the channel&#x27;s closure.

===Timeline===


==Overview==
When the series debuted, it rapidly gained the highest ratings of the three sketch comedies at that period of Australian television. It subsequently gained numerous nominations for major Australian and international film and television awards. The show has also proved to be more commercially successful in Australia than its rivals and was the first to release a VHS/DVD of content from the series.

The show had many different formats. For example, a more risqué variation of the series was broadcast in 2005, entitled &quot;Comedy Inc: The Late Shift&quot;. The episodes were aired at a later time, because of the content. &quot;The Late Shift&quot; aired from 2005 until the end of the series in 2007.

===Skits and formula===
&quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; features original skits, impersonations and irreverent parodies of other television programmes and films. For example, popular Australian and British series such as &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; &quot;Renovation Rescue&quot;, &quot;Hi-5&quot;, &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; (as Bodgy Builder) and &quot;Thomas and Friends&quot; (as Ernest the Engine and Others) are frequently subject to many spoofs, as are Australian news and current affair programmes, such as &quot;Today Tonight&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In addition, the series features original skits, such as &quot;Selina: She Grows on You&quot;, a segment which features an eccentric gardener for a wealthy woman, and her zany and original ways of keeping her garden up to scratch.

A recurring sketch features Emily Taheny as an unnamed woman who approaches other women at inappropriate and private moments such as going to the toilet, showering at a gym or giving birth to a baby. &quot;Matt and Bray&quot; was a skit about family man Al (Russell) and his two odd neighbours (McCarthy and Oxenbould). The skit ended in at the end of season 3, as Ben Oxenbould had left the main cast.

Another recurring sketch features Katrina Retallick as a doctor who approaches her patients stating that &quot;recent medical studies&quot; show that song is the best way to convey possibly upsetting news. She then takes a guitar and starts a cheerful melody about the patient&#x27;s fatal condition such as cancer, AIDS or a brain tumor, with the rest of the hospital staff and eventually the patient singing along.

&quot;Berni (with an &#x27;i&#x27;)&quot; (Taheny) was a 10 part skit about &#x27;Berni&#x27; and her pathway to fame. Also featured Oxenbould as her flamboyantly gay ex-fiancé. Emily Taheny and Mandy McElhinney played two women on an informercial-like programme, selling odd items or already invented items such as a decorative dynamic compression plate or an ice cube tray. Their respective catchphrases which are said several times throughout the sketch are &quot;sensational&quot; and &quot;absolutely&quot;.

A long running skit is &quot;Blokeman&quot; (Russell). The skit always begins with a comic strip story, explaining about an average man (who spoke in a general Australian accent) who made his own beer in his kitchen to have only had it explode, thus becoming &quot;Blokeman&quot;. Blokeman is looked upon as a normal hero, despite his obvious &quot;bogan&quot; qualities (ugg boots, mullet, beer belly, broad Australian accent). He is hesitant to help when people ask and usually finds the easiest way to complete the task. He has a girlfriend named &quot;Wondermoll&quot; (McElhinney). In the later series&#x27;, Blokeman has a nemesis, &quot;Metrosexual Man&quot; (Mallory). When Metrosexual Man appears in a sketch, he is usually followed by the phrase &quot;gay in everyway, except for sexual orientation&quot;.

A notable sketch with a father (Russell) who tucks his young son into bed every night, who usually asks him a question, but unbeknownst to himself, is slightly mature. An example is when the son asks his father &quot;What happened to his cousin&quot;. Instead of telling a white lie, the father explains to his son that his cousin is gay and was thrown out by his homophobic father.

The sketch will always end with the following lines:
*Son: &quot;Honest dad?&quot;
*Father: &quot;Would I lie to you, mate?&quot;

===Timeslots===
When &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; began in early 2003, it held the 8:30 pm Wednesday timeslot for two years before moving to 9:30 pm on various nights in 2005, when it was moved around in attempts to improve ratings and changed its name to &quot;Comedy Inc.: The Late Shift&quot;.

===Comedy Inc: Specials (2005)===
In 2005 two one-hour specials called &quot;Comedy Inc: Takes out TV&quot; were aired, the first during the series and then the week following the final episode before &quot;The Late Shift&quot;. They featured mostly television parody sketches with a few general sketches.

===&quot;Comedy Inc: The Late Shift&quot; (2005–2007)===
Beginning with its 2005 season, the show aired in a later timeslot, in the process changing its name to &quot;Comedy Inc.: The Late Shift&quot;. This version was a success with both audiences and television critics, due to its slightly more risque content, as well as original new characters like &quot;Blokeman&quot; and &quot;Matt and Bray&quot;. The new show marked the beginning of a collaboration between new head writer Rick Kalowski and producer/director David McDonald. (After working together on 45 episodes of the show from 2004, the pair left the show at the end of the fourth series in late 2006).

The fourth series of &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; debuted on Tuesday 30 May 2006 again on the Nine Network. The new series marked the departure of Ben Oxenbould and Gabriel Andrews from the show, and their replacement with the popular Australian comedian Scott Brennan and actor Simon Mallory. In a new 10.30 pm timeslot on Sundays, it again dominated its timeslot, proving especially popular with younger viewers. The fourth series, characterised by darker and even more risque material than the first series of &quot;Comedy Inc.: The Late Shift&quot; (words such as fuck, for example, are no longer censored), ran 25 one-hour episodes in total, following an extension of the series by the Nine Network, making it the longest running series of the show to date.

On Thursday 19 October 2006, the show was nominated at the 2006 &quot;Australian Film Institute Awards&quot; in five categories, including Best Television Comedy Series, Best Direction in Television, and two nominations for Best Performance in a Television Comedy Series, one each for Paul McCarthy and Genevieve Morris.

The fifth season was directed by Damian Davis, previously director of &quot;The Ronnie Johns Half Hour&quot;. The head writers were Kevin Brumpton and Angus Fitzsimons.

The fifth season began production in January 2007 and would end in July 2007. On 5 September 200, most of the female cast left—including Mandy McElhinney, Katrina Retallick and Genevieve Morris—and they were replaced by &quot;SkitHOUSE&quot; actress Fiona Harris, previously recurring actress Rebecca De Unamuno, and newcomer Janis McGavin.

On 26 December 2007, the show aired its final episode, as the cast had felt that the fifth series should be their last.

An international version of the show, comprising a series of 20 half-hour episodes, has aired on cable television in several countries. A second series of the international version of the show aired in late 2007. The international version focusses on sketches, character pieces and parodies of overseas programs, and excludes parodies of Australian programs with which a foreign audience would be unfamiliar.

==Critical and commercial reception==
Although critical reaction to the series on its debut in 2003 was mixed, reviews of the show have improved with each series. The 2005 and 2006 series of the show, in particular, received largely positive reviews from most major Australian newspapers, some suggesting that the later timeslot had made for a darker, more interesting and funnier show. Consistent with that critical response, it is the &#x27;later timeslot&#x27; series of the show that has been nominated for various awards.

Jim Schembri, notoriously tough television critic for the Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; has described the show as &quot;the hands-down funniest and smartest local laughfest on TV in 2006.&quot;

Commercially, Comedy Inc has also proved to be successful, although it never attained the ratings of its 2003 season. The success of the later series is often said to have affected the cancellation of its competitors, such as &quot;skitHOUSE&quot;.

===Award nominations and wins===
As noted above, &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; has received many and various nominations and awards. In 2005, the &quot;Australian Film Institute&quot; Awards nominated &quot;Comedy Inc.: The Late Shift&quot; for Best Television Comedy Series, as well as a 2006 Logie Award for Most Outstanding Comedy Series, and 2006 Rose D&#x27;Or (Golden Rose of Montreaux) Award for Best International Comedy Series. David McDonald received nominations for Best Direction in Television, and for Best Series (in his capacity as producer) at both the 2005 and 2006 &quot;Australian Film Institute&quot; Awards for his work on the show.

<doc id="1056100" wikidata="Q735165" url="?curid=1056100" title="Eastern question">
<text>In diplomatic history, the Eastern question was the issue of the political and economic instability in the Ottoman Empire from the late 18th to early 20th centuries and the subsequent strategic competition and political considerations of the European great powers in light of this. Characterized as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;, the relative weakening of the empire&#x27;s military strength in the second half of the nineteenth century threatened to undermine the fragile balance of power system largely shaped by the Concert of Europe. The Eastern question encompassed myriad interrelated elements: Ottoman military defeats, Ottoman institutional insolvency, the ongoing Ottoman political and economic modernization programme, the rise of ethno-religious nationalism in its provinces, and Great Power rivalries. In an attempt to triangulate between these various concerns, the historian Leslie Rogne Schumacher has proposed the following definition of the Eastern Question:

The period in which the Eastern Question was internationally prominent is also open to interpretation. While there is no specific date on which the Eastern question began, the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 brought the issue to the attention of the European powers, Russia and Britain in particular. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire was believed to be imminent, the European powers engaged in a power struggle to safeguard their military, strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. Imperial Russia stood to benefit from the decline of the Ottoman Empire; on the other hand, Austria-Hungary and Great Britain deemed the preservation of the Empire to be in their best interests. The Eastern question was put to rest after the First World War, one of the outcomes of which was the collapse and division of the Ottoman holdings.

==Background==

The Eastern question emerged as the power of the Ottoman Empire began to decline during the 18th century. The Ottomans were at the height of their power in 1683, when they lost the Battle of Vienna to the combined forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Austria, under the command of John III Sobieski. Peace was made much later, in 1699, with the Treaty of Karlowitz, which forced the Ottoman Empire to cede many of its Central European possessions, including those portions of Hungary which it had occupied. Its westward expansion arrested, the Ottoman Empire never again posed a serious threat to Austria, which became the dominant power in its region of Europe. The Eastern question did not truly develop until the Russo-Turkish Wars of the 18th century.

According to Karl Marx&#x27;s writings around the Crimean War, the main factor of the Eastern question was Russian imperialism towards Turkey—with Turkey being a barrier that would protect the rest of Europe, and thus Britain&#x27;s interests laid with the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War.

==Napoleonic era==

The Napoleonic era (1799–1815) brought some relief to the faltering Ottoman Empire. It distracted Russia from further advances. Napoleon invaded Egypt but his army was trapped there when the British decisively defeated the French fleet at Aboukir Bay. A peace interlude in 1803 allowed the army to return to France.

To secure his own domination and to render the rest of Europe virtually powerless, Napoleon established an alliance with Russia by concluding the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. Russia pledged to provide aid to Napoleon in his war against Britain; in turn, the Emperor of Russia would receive the Ottoman territories of Moldavia and Wallachia. If the Sultan refused to surrender these territories, France and Russia were to attack the Empire, and the Ottoman domains in Europe were to be partitioned between the two allies.

The Napoleonic scheme threatened not only the Sultan, but also Britain, Austria and Prussia, which were almost powerless in the face of such a potent alliance. The alliance naturally proved accommodating to the Austrians, who hoped that a joint Franco-Russian attack, which would probably have utterly devastated the Ottoman Empire, could be prevented by diplomacy; but if diplomatic measures failed, the Austrian minister Klemens von Metternich decided that he would support the partition of the Ottoman Empire—a solution disadvantageous to Austria, but not as dangerous as a complete Russian takeover of Southeastern Europe.

An attack on the Empire, however, did not come to pass, and the alliance concluded at Tilsit was dissolved by the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat by the Great Powers in 1815, representatives of the victors met at the Congress of Vienna, but failed to take any action relating to the territorial integrity of the decaying Ottoman Empire. This omission, together with the exclusion of the Sultan from the Holy Alliance, was interpreted by many as supportive of the position that the Eastern question was a Russian domestic issue that did not concern any other European nations.

==Serbian Revolution==


The Serbian Revolution or &quot;Revolutionary Serbia&quot; refers to the national and social revolution of the Serbian people between 1804 and 1815, during which Serbia managed to fully emancipate itself from the Ottoman Empire and exist as a sovereign European nation-state, and a latter period (1815–1833), marked by intense negotiations between Belgrade and the Ottoman Empire. The term was invented by a famous German historian, Leopold von Ranke, in his book &quot;Die Serbische Revolution&quot;, published in 1829. These events marked the foundation of modern Serbia. While the first phase of the revolution (1804–1815) was in fact a war of independence, the second phase (1815–1833) resulted in official recognition of a suzerain Serbian state by the Porte (the Ottoman government), thus bringing the revolution to its end.

The revolution took place by stages: the First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813), led by Karađorđe Petrović; Hadži Prodan&#x27;s revolt (1814); the Second Serbian Uprising (1815) under Miloš Obrenović; and official recognition of the Serbian state (1815–1833) by the Porte.

&quot;The Proclamation&quot; (1809) by Karađorđe in the capital Belgrade represented the peak of the revolution. It called for unity of the Serbian nation, emphasizing the importance of freedom of religion, Serbian history and formal, written rules of law, all of which it claimed the Ottoman Empire had failed to provide. It also called on Serbs to stop paying the jizya tax to the Porte.

The ultimate result of the uprisings was Serbia&#x27;s suzerainty from the Ottoman Empire. The Principality of Serbia was established, governed by its own parliament, government, constitution and its own royal dynasty. Social element of the revolution was achieved through introduction of the bourgeois society values in Serbia, which is why it was considered the world&#x27;s easternmost bourgeois revolt, which culminated with the abolition of feudalism in 1806. The establishment of the first constitution in the Balkans in 1835 (later abolished) and the founding in 1808 of its first university, Belgrade&#x27;s Great Academy, added to the achievements of the young Serb state. By 1833, Serbia was officially recognized as a tributary to the Ottoman Empire and as such, acknowledged as a hereditary monarchy. Full independence of the Principality was internationally recognized during the second half of the 19th century.

==Greek War of Independence==

The Eastern question once again became a major European issue when the Greeks declared independence from the Sultan in 1821. It was at about this time that the phrase &quot;Eastern question&quot; was coined. Ever since the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, there had been rumours that the Emperor of Russia sought to invade the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek Revolt seemed to make an invasion even more likely. The British foreign minister, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, as well as the Austrian foreign minister, Metternich, counselled the Emperor of Russia, Alexander I, not to enter the war. Instead, they pleaded that he maintain the Concert of Europe (the spirit of broad collaboration in Europe which had persisted since Napoleon&#x27;s defeat). A desire for peaceful co-operation was also held by Alexander I, who had founded the Holy Alliance. Rather than immediately putting the Eastern question to rest by aiding the Greeks and attacking the Ottomans, Alexander wavered, ultimately failing to take any decisive action.

Alexander&#x27;s death in 1825 brought Nicholas I to the Imperial Throne of Russia. Deciding that he would no longer tolerate negotiations and conferences, he chose to intervene in Greece. Britain also soon became involved, with its intervention motivated in part by the desire to prevent the young Greek state from becoming a wholly Russian vassal. The spirit of romanticism that then dominated Western European cultural life also made support for Greek independence politically viable. France too aligned itself with the Greeks, but Austria (still worried about Russian expansion) did not. Outraged by the interference of the Great Powers, the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, denounced Russia as an enemy of Islam, prompting Russia to declare war in 1828. An alarmed Austria sought to form an anti-Russian coalition, but its attempts were in vain.

As the war continued into 1829, Russia gained a firm advantage over the Ottoman Empire. By prolonging hostilities further, however, Russia would have invited Austria to enter the war against her and would have resulted in considerable suspicion in Britain. Therefore, for the Russians to continue with the war in hopes of destroying the Ottoman Empire would have been inexpedient. At this stage, the King of France, Charles X, proposed the partition of the Ottoman Empire among Austria, Russia and others, but his scheme was presented too belatedly to produce a result.

Thus, Russia was able to secure neither a decisive defeat nor a partition of the Ottoman Empire. It chose, however, to adopt the policy of degrading the Ottoman Empire to a mere dependency. In 1829, the Emperor of Russia concluded the Treaty of Adrianople with the Sultan; his empire was granted additional territory along the Black Sea, Russian commercial vessels were granted access to the Dardanelles, and the commercial rights of Russians in the Ottoman Empire were enhanced. The Greek War of Independence was terminated shortly thereafter, as Greece was granted independence by the Treaty of Constantinople in 1832.

==Muhammad Ali of Egypt==
Just as the Greek Revolt was coming to an end, the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833) broke out in the Ottoman Empire between the Sultan and his nominal viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali. The modern and well trained Egyptians looked as though they could conquer the empire. The Tsar of Russia, in keeping with his policy of reducing the Ottoman Sultan to a petty vassal, offered to form an alliance with the Sultan. In 1833, the two rulers negotiated the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, in which Russia secured complete dominance over the Ottomans. The Russians pledged to protect the Empire from external attacks; in turn, the Sultan pledged to close the Dardanelles to warships whenever Russia was at war. This provision of the Treaty raised a problem known as the &quot;Straits question&quot;. The agreement provided for the closure for all warships, but many European statesmen mistakenly believed that the clause allowed Russian vessels. Britain and France were angered by the misinterpreted clause; they also sought to contain Russian expansionism. The two kingdoms, however, differed on how to achieve their objective; the British wished to uphold the Sultan, but the French preferred to make Muhammad Ali (whom they saw as more competent) the ruler of the entire Ottoman Empire. Russian intervention led the Sultan to negotiate a peace with Muhammad Ali in 1833, but war broke out once again in 1839.

Sultan Mahmud II died the same year, leaving the Ottoman Empire to his son Abdulmejid I in a critical state: the Ottoman army had been significantly defeated by the forces of Muhammad Ali. Another disaster followed when the entire Turkish fleet was seized by the Egyptian forces. Great Britain and Russia now intervened to prevent the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but France still continued to support Muhammad Ali. In 1840, however, the Great Powers agreed to compromise; Muhammad Ali agreed to make a nominal act of submission to the Sultan, but was granted hereditary control of Egypt.

The only unresolved issue of the period was the Straits question. In 1841, Russia consented to the abrogation of the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi by accepting the London Straits Convention. The Great Powers — Russia, Britain, France, Austria and Prussia — agreed to the re-establishment of the &quot;ancient rule&quot; of the Ottoman Empire, which provided that the Turkish straits would be closed to all warships whatsoever, with the exception of the Sultan&#x27;s allies during wartime. With the Straits Convention, the Russian Emperor Nicholas I abandoned the idea of reducing the Sultan to a state of dependence, and returned to the plan of partitioning Ottoman territories in Europe.

Thus, after the resolution of the Egyptian struggle which had begun in 1831, the weak Ottoman Empire was no longer wholly dependent on Russia but was dependent on the Great Powers for protection. Attempts at internal reform failed to end the decline of the Empire. By the 1840s, the Ottoman Empire had become the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;, and its eventual dissolution appeared inevitable.

==Revolutions of 1848==

After the Great Powers reached a compromise to end the revolt of Mehmet Ali, the Eastern question lay dormant for about a decade until revived by the Revolutions of 1848. Although Russia could have seized the opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire—France and Austria were at the time occupied by their own insurrections—it chose not to. Instead, Emperor Nicholas committed his troops to the defence of Austria, hoping to establish goodwill to allow him to seize Ottoman possessions in Europe later.

After the Austrian Revolution was suppressed, an Austro-Russian war against the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent. The Emperors of both Austria and Russia demanded that the Sultan return Austrian rebels who had sought asylum in the Empire, but he refused. The indignant monarchs withdrew their ambassadors to the Sublime Porte, threatening armed conflict. Almost immediately, however, Britain and France sent their fleets to protect the Ottoman Empire. The two Emperors, deeming military hostilities futile, withdrew their demands for the surrender of the fugitives. The short crisis created a closer relationship between Britain and France, which led to a joint war against Russia in the Crimean War of 1853–56.

==Crimean War==

A new conflict began during the 1850s with a religious dispute. Under treaties negotiated during the 18th century, France was the guardian of Roman Catholics in the Ottoman Empire, while Russia was the protector of Orthodox Christians. For several years, however, Catholic and Orthodox monks had disputed possession of the Church of the Nativity and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Palestine. During the early 1850s, the two sides made demands which the Sultan could not possibly satisfy simultaneously. In 1853, the Sultan adjudicated in favour of the French, despite the vehement protestations of the local Orthodox monks.
Emperor Nicholas of Russia dispatched Prince Menshikov on a special mission to the Porte. By previous treaties, the Sultan was committed &quot;to protect the Christian religion and its Churches&quot;, but Menshikov tried to negotiate a new treaty, under which Russia would be allowed to interfere whenever it deemed the Sultan&#x27;s protection inadequate. At the same time, however, the British government sent Lord Stratford, who learnt of Menshikov&#x27;s demands upon arriving. Through skillful diplomacy, Lord Stratford convinced the Sultan to reject the treaty, which compromised the independence of the Ottomans. Shortly after he learned of the failure of Menshikov&#x27;s diplomacy, Nicholas marched into Moldavia and Wallachia (Ottoman principalities in which Russia was acknowledged as a special guardian of the Orthodox Church), with the pretext that the Sultan failed to resolve the issue of the Holy Places. Nicholas believed that the European powers would not object strongly to the annexation of a few neighbouring Ottoman provinces, especially given Russian involvement in suppressing the Revolutions of 1848.

Britain, seeking to maintain the security of the Ottoman Empire, sent a fleet to the Dardanelles, where it was joined by another fleet sent by France. Yet the European powers hoped for a diplomatic compromise. The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers—Britain, France, Austria and Prussia—met in Vienna, where they drafted a note which they hoped would be acceptable to both the Russians and the Ottomans. The note was approved by Nicolas but rejected by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I, who felt that the document&#x27;s poor phrasing left it open to many interpretations. Britain, France and Austria were united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but their suggestions were ignored in the Court of Saint Petersburg. Britain and France set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia held hope for diplomacy despite the rejection of the proposed amendments. The Sultan proceeded to war, his armies attacking the Russian army near the Danube. Nicholas responded by despatching warships, which destroyed the entire Ottoman fleet at Sinop on 30 November 1853, allowing Russia to land and supply its forces on the Ottoman shores fairly easily. The destruction of the Ottoman fleet and the threat of Russian expansion alarmed both Britain and France, who stepped forth in defence of the Ottoman Empire. In 1854, after Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to withdraw from the Danubian Principalities, Britain and France declared war.

Among those who supported the Franco-English point of view was Karl Marx, in his articles for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; circa 1853. Karl Marx saw the Crimean War as a conflict between the democratic ideals of the west that started with &quot;great movement of 1789&quot; against &quot;Russia and Absolutism&quot;. Marx saw the Ottoman Empire as a buffer against a pattern of expansionism by the Tsar.

Emperor Nicholas I presumed that Austria, in return for the support rendered during the Revolutions of 1848, would side with him, or at the very least remain neutral. However, Austria felt threatened by the Russian troops in the nearby Danubian Principalities. When Britain and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Principalities, Austria supported them; and, though it did not immediately declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality. When, in the summer of 1854, Austria made another demand for the withdrawal of troops, Russia (fearing that Austria would enter the war) complied.

Though the original grounds for war were lost when Russia withdrew her troops from the Danubian Principalities, Britain and France continued hostilities. Determined to address the Eastern question by ending the Russian threat to the Ottoman Empire, the allies posed several conditions for a ceasefire, including that Russia should give up its protectorate over the Danubian Principalities; that Russia should abandon any right to interfere in Ottoman affairs on the behalf of Orthodox Christians; that the Straits Convention of 1841 was to be revised; and finally, all nations were to be granted access to the river Danube. As the Emperor refused to comply with these &quot;Four Points&quot;, the Crimean War proceeded.

Peace negotiations began in 1856 under the Emperor Nicholas I&#x27;s successor, Alexander II. Under the ensuing Treaty of Paris, the &quot;Four Points&quot; plan proposed earlier was largely adhered to; most notably, Russia&#x27;s special privileges relating to the Danubian Principalities were transferred to the Great Powers as a group. In addition, warships of all nations were perpetually excluded from the Black Sea, once the home to a Russian fleet (which had been destroyed during the war). The Emperor of Russia and the Sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on that sea coast. The Black Sea clauses came at a tremendous disadvantage to Russia, for it greatly diminished the naval threat it posed to the Ottomans. Moreover, all the Great Powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire.

The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when France was crushed in the Franco-Prussian War. While Prussia and several other German states united into a powerful German Empire, Napoleon III was deposed in the formation of the French Third Republic. Napoleon had opposed Russia over the Eastern question in order to gain the support of Britain. But the new French Republic did not oppose Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire because that did not significantly threaten French interests. Encouraged by the decision of France, and supported by the German minister Otto, Fürst von Bismarck, Russia denounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As Britain alone could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.

==Great Eastern Crisis (1875–78)==

In 1875 the territory of Herzegovina rebelled against the Ottoman Sultan in the Province of Bosnia; soon after, Bulgaria rebelled as well. The Great Powers believed they should intervene to prevent a bloody war in the Balkans. The first to act were the members of the League of the Three Emperors (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), whose common attitude toward the Eastern Question was embodied in the Andrassy Note of 30 December 1875 (named for the Hungarian diplomat Julius, Count Andrassy). The note, seeking to avoid a widespread conflagration in Southeastern Europe, urged the Sultan to institute various reforms, including granting religious liberty to Christians. A joint commission of Christians and Muslims was to be established to ensure the enactment of appropriate reforms. With the approval of Britain and France, the note was submitted to the Sultan, and he agreed on 31 January 1876. But the Herzegovinian leaders rejected the proposal, pointing out that the Sultan had already failed in his promises of reforms.

Representatives of the Three Emperors met again in Berlin, where they approved the Berlin Memorandum (May 1876). To convince the Herzegovinians, the memorandum suggested that international representatives be allowed to oversee the institution of reforms in the rebelling provinces. But before the memorandum could be approved by the Porte, the Ottoman Empire was convulsed by internal strife, which led to the deposition of Sultan Abdul-Aziz (30 May 1876). The new Sultan, Murad V, was himself deposed three months later due to his mental instability, and Sultan Abdul Hamid II came to power (31 August 1876). In the meantime, the hardships of the Ottomans had increased; their treasury was empty, and they faced insurrections not only in Herzegovina and Bulgaria, but also in Serbia and Montenegro. Still, the Ottoman Empire managed to crush the insurgents in August 1876. The result inconvenienced Russia, which had planned to take possession of various Ottoman territories in Southeastern Europe in the course of the conflict.

After the uprisings were largely suppressed, however, rumours of Ottoman atrocities against the rebellious population shocked European sensibilities.
Russia now intended to enter the conflict on the side of the rebels. Delegates of the Great Powers (who now numbered six due to the rise of Italy) assembled at the Constantinople Conference (23 December 1876 to 20 January 1877) to make another attempt for peace. However, the Sultan refused the December 1876 proposals to allow international representatives to oversee the reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1877 the Great Powers again made proposals to the Ottoman Empire, which the Porte rejected (18 January 1877).

Russia declared war against the Ottoman Empire on 24 April 1877. The Russian chancellor Prince Gorchakov had effectively secured Austrian neutrality with the Reichstadt Agreement of July 1876, under which Ottoman territories captured in the course of the war would be partitioned between the Russian and Austria-Hungarian Empires, with the latter obtaining Bosnia and Herzegovina. Britain, though acutely aware of the Russian threat to its colonies in India, did not involve itself in the conflict. However, when Russia threatened to conquer Constantinople, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli urged Austria and Germany to ally with him against this war-aim. Russia negotiated peace through the Treaty of San Stefano (3 March 1878), which stipulated independence to Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro, autonomy to Bulgaria, reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the ceding Dobruja and parts of Armenia and a large indemnity to Russia. This would give Russia great influence in Southeastern Europe, as it could dominate the newly independent states. To reduce these advantages to Russia, the Great Powers (especially Britain), insisted on a thorough revision of the Treaty of San Stefano.

At the Congress of Berlin, the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878 adjusted the boundaries of the new states in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s favour. Bulgaria was divided into two states (Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia), as it was feared that a single state would be susceptible to Russian domination. Ottoman cessions to Russia were largely sustained. Bosnia and Herzegovina, though still nominally within the Ottoman Empire, were transferred to Austrian control. A secret agreement between Britain and the Ottoman Empire transferred the Ottoman island of Cyprus to Britain. These final two procedures were predominantly negotiated by Disraeli, whom Otto von Bismarck famously described as &quot;The old Jew, that is the man&quot;, after his level-headed Palmerstonian approach to the Eastern question.

==Germany and the Ottoman Empire==

Germany drew away from Russia and became closer to Austria-Hungary, with whom it concluded the Dual Alliance in 1879. Germany also closely allied with the Ottoman Empire. The German government took over the re-organisation of the Ottoman military and financial system; in return, it received several commercial concessions, including permission to build the Baghdad Railway, which secured for them access to several important economic markets and opened the potential for German entry into the Persian Gulf area, then controlled by Britain. German interest was driven not only by commercial interests, but also by a burgeoning rivalry with Britain and France. Meanwhile, Britain agreed to the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904, thereby resolving differences between the two countries over international affairs. Britain also reconciled with Russia in 1907 with the Anglo-Russian Entente.

For the German historian Leopold von Ranke Christianity was morally most superior and could not be improved upon. When Ranke wrote &quot;Zur orientalischen Frage. Gutachten&quot; at the behest of the kaiser he framed the Eastern Question as primarily religious in nature; the civil rights of Christians against Muslims in the Ottoman Empire could only be secured by the intervention of the Christian European nations. He was considered a leading authority in the field of Orientalism in his time.

==Young Turk Revolution==
In April 1908, the Committee of Union and Progress (more commonly called the Young Turks), a political party opposed to the despotic rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, led a rebellion against the Sultan. The pro-reform Young Turks deposed the Sultan by July 1909, replacing him with the ineffective Mehmed V. This began the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire.

In the following years, various constitutional and political reforms were instituted, but the decay of the Ottoman Empire continued.

== Bosnian Crisis ==
As the Young Turks took charge of the government in the Ottoman Empire, the Austrians feared they might regain control of Bosnia and Herzegovina – which was under the de facto rule of Austria-Hungary under the Treaty of Berlin, but the provinces officially remained possessions of the Ottoman Empire. The Austrian foreign minister Graf (count) Lexa von Aehrenthal resolved to annex the territory, which was both economically and strategically important. Russia was contacted by Aehrenthal. Izvolsky agreed that Russia would not object to the annexation. In return, Austria would not object to opening the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits to Russian warships, an advantage that had been denied to Russia since 1841. On October 7, 1908, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Serbians were outraged. However, Germany was allied with Austria, leaving Serbia helpless against two great powers. Although the conflict was resolved without any immediate warfare, the result embittered relations between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Russia&#x27;s resentment at having been deceived and humiliated contributed to the outbreak of World War I.

<text>The Religious Zionist Party (), known as Tkuma () until 2021 and officially known as National Union–Tkuma (, ), was a far-right, ultra-nationalist, Jewish supremacist, and religious Zionist political party in Israel. In all the elections since its founding in 1998, the party had joined other factions and competed as part of a united list. In 2023, the Religious Zionist Party and The Jewish Home agreed to merge to become National Religious Party–Religious Zionism.

==History==
Tkuma was established by Hanan Porat and Zvi Hendel in 1998. The pair left the National Religious Party in reaction to the Wye River Memorandum. Almost immediately after the creation of Tkuma, it joined together with Moledet and Herut – The National Movement, to form the National Union, a right-wing coalition which won four seats in the 1999 elections, with only one of those seats going to Tkuma. These elections were a failure for the right-wing bloc, and were won by Ehud Barak, leaving the National Union and Tkuma in the opposition.
In February 2000, Yisrael Beiteinu joined the National Union, alongside Tkuma, and the two parties joined Ariel Sharon&#x27;s first government in 2001. One year later, Tkuma and the rest of the National Union left Sharon&#x27;s government over disagreements over the handling of the Second Intifada. For the 2003 elections, the National Union kept its alliance with Yisrael Beiteinu, with its increased support helping to win seven seats for the entire list, and two for Tkuma. The party was included in Ariel Sharon&#x27;s coalition, alongside Likud, Shinui, the National Religious Party, and Yisrael BaAliyah.

Because of tensions over the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip (Tkuma was ideologically opposed, and Hendel lived in the Gaza settlement of Ganei Tal), National Union ministers Binyamin Elon and Avigdor Lieberman were sacked, and the party left the coalition. However, the National Union was bolstered by the addition of Ahi, which had split off from the National Religious Party when they decided to remain in the coalition.

Before the 2006 elections, the alliance between the National Union and Yisrael Beiteinu was dissolved, and a new alliance between the National Union and the National Religious Party was formed, which won nine seats, two of which were allocated to Tkuma and taken by Hendel and Uri Ariel.

On 3 November 2008, ahead of the 2009 elections, Tkuma faced a crisis. The party itself announced that it would unite with Ahi, the National Religious Party, and Moledet, to form a new right-wing party, which was later named the Jewish Home. However, around half of the former Tkuma members later left the new party to re-establish Tkuma and rejoin the National Union alongside Moledet, Hatikva, and Eretz Yisrael Shelanu. In the elections themselves, the National Union got four seats, with Tkuma getting two seats.
Ahead of the 2013 elections, the National Union split, with all member parties except for Tkuma splitting off to form Otzma LeYisrael, leaving Tkuma as the only party left in the National Union. Tkuma proceeded to change its name to &quot;National Union–Tkuma&quot;, appropriating the National Union name. The party opted to run as part of the Jewish Home list for the 2013 elections. The Jewish Home won 12 seats, four of which (Ariel, Ben-Dahan, Kalfa, and Strook) were members of Tkuma. The party decided to continue its alliance with the Jewish Home for the 2015 Knesset elections, taking the 2nd, 8th, 13th, and 17th spots on the joint list. The Jewish Home dropped to eight seats in that election.
In 2019 Bezalel Smotrich took over party leadership, winning party elections in a landslide against Ariel. Ahead of the April 2019 elections, the party joined with the Jewish Home and Otzma Yehudit to create the Union of Right-Wing Parties, which won five seats in the elections, two of which went to National Union–Tkuma. 

Ahead of the September 2019 elections, Tkuma and the Jewish Home agreed to form an alliance with the New Right, called Yamina, with Tkuma leader Smotrich receiving the third spot on the joint list.

Yamina officially split on 10 October 2019 into two Knesset factions – the New Right, and the Jewish Home–National Union. For the 2020 elections, Otzma Yehudit and The Jewish Home agreed on 20 December to run together, in an alliance later named the United Jewish Home. Smotrich was critical of the move, stating that it was unlikely that the alliance would pass the electoral threshold. Tkuma, The Jewish Home, and the New Right reformed Yamina on 15 January 2020. On 22 April 2020 it was reported that Yamina leader Naftali Bennett was now &quot;considering all options&quot; for Yamina&#x27;s political future, including departing from Netanyahu&#x27;s government, which had just agreed to a coalition government with the leader of the opposition Blue and White party, Benny Gantz, and joining the opposition. Bennett was said to be unhappy with the new coalition government&#x27;s decision to hold back on the issue of judicial reform.

On 14 May 2020 The Jewish Home&#x27;s only Knesset member, Rafi Peretz, ended his status as a member of Yamina, and agreed to join Netanyahu&#x27;s new government as well. On 15 May, Tkuma, along with the New Right, split with Netanyahu and made the Yamina alliance a member of the opposition. On 17 May 2020 Bennett met with Gantz, who also succeeded him as defence minister, and declared that the Yamina party would be a member of the opposition, with its &quot;head held high&quot;. Tkuma was renamed on 7 January, while it ended its membership in Yamina on 20 January 2021.

In February 2021 the party agreed to run a shared list for the 2021 Knesset elections with Noam and Otzma Yehudit. The list ran under the Religious Zionist Party name and won six seats, four of which were filled by Religious Zionist Party members. On 14 June, after the swearing-in of the 36th government, MK Ofir Sofer split from the Likud faction and merged into the Religious Zionist Party, increasing the number of seats held by the party to seven. He had run during the election as part of the Likud list for Knesset, as a member of Atid Ehad party, using it as a shelf party (a dormant, but still-registered, party brought back into use).

The Religious Zionist Party, Noam and Otzma Yehudit submitted a single list on 14 September 2022 ahead of the 2022 Knesset elections, which saw the alliance win 14 seats. The parties split into three parties in the Knesset on 20 November 2022.

==Ideology==
The Religious Zionist Party is opposed to any territorial concessions to Palestinian or Syrian claims for land. Some members support the annexation of the entire West Bank, though the official policy of the Jewish Home parliamentary faction, of which the party was aligned between 2013 and 2019, only supports annexation of Area C of the West Bank, which makes up the 63% of land in the West Bank allocated to Israel in the Oslo Accords. The party is opposed to recognition of same-sex marriage on a religious basis. The party advocates for increased funding for Torah study and religious education. Jewish-American columnist David E. Rosenberg has stated that the Religious Zionist Party&#x27;s &quot;platform includes things like annexation of West Bank settlements, the expulsion of asylum-seekers, and political control of the judicial system&quot;. He further described the Religious Zionist Party as a political party &quot;driven by Jewish supremacy and anti-Arab racism&quot;. The party has been assessed by &quot;The Middle East Journal&quot; as &quot;militantly anti-Arab&quot; and far-right.

<text>U.S. television science fiction is a popular genre of television in the United States that has produced many of the best-known and most popular science fiction shows in the world. Most famous of all, and one of the most influential science-fiction series in history, is the iconic &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its various spin-off shows, which comprise the Star Trek franchise. Other hugely influential programs have included the 1960s anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone,&quot; the internationally successful &quot;The X-Files,&quot; and a wide variety of television movies and continuing series for more than half a century.

==History==

===20th century===

====1940s through the mid-1960s====

=====The adventure serials=====
The first popular science-fiction program on American television was the DuMont Television Network children&#x27;s adventure serial &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;, which ran from June 1949 to April 1955. Within eight months of Captain Video&#x27;s debut, two other landmark series were launched - &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot; (August 1950 - June 1955) and &quot;Space Patrol&quot; (March 1950 - February 1955). ABC attempted to cash in on the burgeoning television science fiction market with a small screen version of &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; in 1950, but failed within months. Another series of the 1950s, &quot;Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers&quot; broadcast live Saturdays from April 18, 1953, to May 29, 1954. The show was eventually cancelled due to a copyright infringement lawsuit based on the show&#x27;s conceptual similarity to &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot;.

Although &quot;Captain Video&quot; was not a very sophisticated program by later standards, this series took advantage of many newly developed technologies, such as luminance key effects to create superimposition, although it also fell back on such older techniques as using stock footage from film libraries to cover scene breaks. Its reported budget for new props was just $25 per episode.

Nevertheless, &quot;Captain Video&quot; proved to be very popular, drawing audiences of 3.5 million at its peak, a more than respectable number for television at that time. It fired the imaginations of many of its young viewers, who had never before seen science fiction outside of cinemas, and had never been able to follow the same characters in a science-fiction setting over a prolonged period of time. The financial crisis of the DuMont Network eventually led to the cancellation of &quot;Captain Video&quot;, and soon the collapse of the entire network itself. However, the program had made its mark, and other science-fiction shows followed during the 1950s.

Within eight months of the debut of &quot;Captain Video&quot;, two other series would come to eclipse the program in popular memory. &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot; (1950–55) and &quot;Space Patrol&quot; (1950–55) were a fast-turnaround second generation of TV sci-fi, telling more compelling stories on larger budgets. Thanks to a stronger connection to their sponsors, both shows offered a shower of mail-in premiums that solidified their brand names, leading to the first TV tie-in toys on store shelves. Both offered daily radio programs featuring the television casts to augment their television adventures, and the actors were pressed into service for public appearances on a weekly basis. The schedule was grueling, but the resulting media blitz resulted in a large and loyal fan base for both programs. Both of these shows offered something &quot;Captain Video&quot; could not - due to the poor budget of the series, Captain Video was earthbound. The space adventures of &quot;Tom Corbett&quot; and &quot;Space Patrol&quot; forced Captain Video to eventually take to the stars to compete.

(A sidenote: most modern television viewers are aware of &quot;Captain Video&quot; only by his mention by Art Carney on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;; by the time the episode was aired, the show had already been cancelled, and the space helmet Carney wore was a commercially available toy marketed from &quot;Space Patrol&quot;.)

ABC’s attempt to cash in on the success of this genre was a small screen version of &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, which had already proved to be a huge success as a film serial in the 1930s. Running for a single season, 1950–1951, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; starred Kem Dibbs and later Robert Pastene in the lead role. Like &quot;Captain Video&quot;, it was the victim of a very small budget, which restricted most of its action to a single laboratory set, hardly the most thrilling of situations for its young target audience.

Another 1930s serial was also resurrected for the small screen: &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, starring Steve Holland in the title role. Episode credits indicate that it was filmed in Germany and France and syndicated in the U.S. It ran for a single season of 39 episodes, from 1953 to 1954. Another film hero, an alien living on Earth, transitioned to television in the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; which ran from 1952 to 1958.

Other series existed, but mostly in independent syndication. &quot;Captain Z-Ro&quot; was initially broadcast locally in San Francisco beginning in 1951, but moved to national syndication during its final two years of production beginning in 1954. &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot; was syndicated nationally for its two-year run from 1954 to 1955. Generally a superior program to most of the sci-fi series of the time, &quot;Rocky Jones&quot; was a victim of timing; by 1954, public interest was returning to the western genre. By the end of 1955, all of the episodic science fiction adventure series were gone from the airwaves.

=====The anthology series=====
Gradually, television producers realized that there was an adult audience as well as a young audience for science fiction. Television began to cater to a more cerebral brand of science fiction viewer, possibly inspired by the contemporary boom in literary science fiction by the likes of Isaac Asimov, or by the popularity of the allegorical science-fiction movies that were produced during the decade, such as &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;.

One of the stalwarts of science fiction television programming in its early decades was the anthology series, in which a completely new story would be presented in each episode, with new actors, settings, and situations. The only continuing link was the producers, the genre, and the series title. The first series of this kind was &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; running for 85 episodes, between 1951 and 1953, it was meant to be the first science fiction show for adults. The next popular series was &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, a syndicated series that ran for 78 episodes between 1955 and 1957.

Two years after its run finished, a much more popular and influential program in the same vein debuted on the CBS Network: &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, hosted by Rod Serling. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; began life as a one-off pilot, commissioned after the success of a science-fiction episode of the general drama anthology series &quot;Westinghouse-Desilu Playhouse&quot;. In its original form, the series ran for five years, from September 1959 until September 1964, with 156 episodes aired during that time. Presenting a vast array of science-fiction and horror concepts, its run included many memorable episodes whose imagery still lingers in American popular consciousness. One of its most enduring motifs has been its theme music, which is now recognized internationally.

&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was the bedrock of the more grown-up science fiction that would be produced during the 1960s. It was shot on film (as was now standard for much American non-live television programs), well-produced, and featured imaginative writing. One of the best-known episodes was the 1963 installment &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,&quot; which starred a young William Shatner (later cast as &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; Captain Kirk) as a man convinced that a hideous monster is lurking on the wing of the airplane in which he is traveling, even though nobody else can see it. That episode helped launch the career of Shatner, as well as a film version and a revival series during the 1980s. 

ABC twice attempted their own science fiction anthologies, first with 1959&#x27;s &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, then with 1963&#x27;s &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. (ABC briefly tried to hire Serling after &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; ended, but Serling noted that ABC&#x27;s proposal was more horror-oriented in that it &quot;booked (him) into a graveyard every week&quot; and turned the network down.) Although &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; had a much shorter run, finishing in 1965, it proved to be famous and influential as well. Like its CBS contemporary, it spawned an only moderately successful revival decades later. &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; survived in frequent reruns because its owner, Alcoa, abandoned the copyright.

=====Return of the adventure series=====
Irwin Allen, who later went on to produce famous 1970s disaster movies like &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, produced a whole range of popular science fiction series shows on American television during the 1960s. These included &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1964-1968), &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; (1966-1967), and &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; (1968-1970). All involved futuristic, scientific concepts played out as the background to glossily produced action/adventure shows. Critics of Allen’s output often argue that it is all rather soulless and shallow, but as mass-produced entertainment it proved popular with American and international audiences. A popular non-Allen production was &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (1965 to 1969) which incorporated classic Western elements, espionage thriller and science fiction/alternate history concepts (in a similar vein to what would later be called steampunk).

The mid 1960s would prove to be an important period in the history of US television science fiction. It saw the creation of two brand new &quot;space opera&quot;-based science fiction shows, both featuring broad galactic exploration themes, with each show dealing with them in very different manners. The first of these was Irwin Allen&#x27;s CBS show &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, which ran for three seasons from 1965 to 1968, and the other series, which premiered on NBC in 1966, was &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

====&quot;Star Trek&quot; and its influence====

=====The series=====
&quot;Star Trek&quot; (later retronymically known as &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;) began as an unscreened pilot made in 1964 before the series began in 1966. The show was conceived by screenwriter and producer Gene Roddenberry, depicting a future of galactic exploration and struggle, with all creeds and colors of humanity working together to explore the stars in a similar manner to the pioneers of the old West in America. Produced by Paramount for the NBC Network, Roddenberry’s original 1964 pilot for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, called &quot;The Cage&quot; and starring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike, was regarded as being too intellectual and slow-moving by the network: however, they had sufficient faith in the ideas behind the program to commission a second pilot, which replaced the character of Pike and all but one of the rest (Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy, was the only character carried over from the original 1964 pilot) with a new crew commanded by Captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner. 
The show used a few established science fiction authors. Harlan Ellison wrote “The City on the Edge of Forever”, Richard Matheson wrote &quot;The Enemy Within,&quot; and Theodore Sturgeon wrote “Shore Leave” and “Amok Time”.

=====&quot;Star Trek&quot; and social commentary=====
&quot;Star Trek&quot; was also known for its social commentary. The background for this commentary was a set of alien cultures that roughly paralleled the Earth of today. The United Federation of Planets was analogous to America, Starfleet to NATO, the Klingons to the Soviet Union, and the Romulans to China.

When that background seemed restrictive, &quot;Star Trek&quot; would create new cultures and new situations. When an episode was written about racial prejudice (“Let That Be Your Last Battlefield”), half-black and half-white aliens were created. Frank Gorshin, playing Commissioner Bele, was black on the right side of his body, and white on the left. He was trying to arrest Lokai, played by Lou Antonio, who was black on the left, and white on the right. When Bele brought Lokai back to their home planet, no one was left alive. A racial war had killed everybody. In spite of Kirk saying “Give up your hate”, Bele and Lokai fled the Enterprise and continued their fight on the planet&#x27;s surface. The focus of this episode was not technology, but feelings and philosophy. The prejudice, and the pursuit of Lokai by Bele could have been a story without the presence of a star ship, and a pursuit across the galaxy. Therefore, it would be an example of soft science fiction.

Star Trek could also be technical. In the episode &quot;The Changeling,&quot; Nomad is an Earth space probe that becomes damaged, and then somehow merges with the alien probe Tan-Ru. Its programming somehow changes, and it now seeks out and destroys imperfect life-forms. Nomad destroys the Malurian System&#x27;s four billion inhabitants, and then encounters the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Kirk and his crew discover Nomad&#x27;s past and its new programming, and have to stop it before it destroys any more races. This, of course, they do. This is a classic case of out-of-control technology. Without Nomad, the technological artifact, there could have been no story. Science is used to analyze Nomad, and to determine how to defeat it. Therefore, this episode is an example of hard science fiction.

In this new form, &quot;Star Trek&quot; ran for three years until 1969, although it was never a huge ratings hit and stopped two years short of its planned five-year run. Only a fan campaign had prevented it from being canceled after the second season, but despite this apparent unpopularity, the show had a special quality to it that attracted a loyal fan base, and during syndication of the program in the early 1970s it proved to have an enduring popularity that would not go away. An animated series was commissioned, and eventually in the late 1970s a sequel series, &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot; was planned and work begun. However, after the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in the cinema, Paramount scrapped the idea of a new series and decided instead upon launching &quot;Star Trek&quot; as a film franchise. &quot;Star Trek&quot; would return to the small screen in a new form in due course, but not until 1987, some eighteen years after its original cancellation.

&quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; propensity for social commentary, in an era when American viewers were more receptive of it, was a factor in the rise in popularity of science fiction in American culture in the late 1960s. Much of this rise came at the expense of the more traditionally-positioned TV western, which collapsed in popularity at the same time.

====1970s====
Apart from repeats of &quot;Star Trek&quot; gathering popularity in syndication, the early 1970s proved to be at something of a low ebb for television science fiction in the US. Very few series of any great note or popularity were produced, and few if any from this period are remembered today. The success in syndication of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and fan pressure for a &quot;Star Trek&quot; revival, led to &quot;The Animated Series&quot; (1973–1974). &quot;The Animated Series&quot; continued the adventures of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and its crew, and is considered canonical. After several false starts, a second live-action &quot;Star Trek&quot; series began development in 1977, prospectively titled &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;. However, the show was abruptly cancelled just weeks away from commencing production and Paramount decided to make a feature film instead, which was eventually released in 1979.

After the end of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and before the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie, producer Gene Roddenberry tried unsuccessfully to pitch new science fiction shows; while most never got off the ground, some made it to the pilot stage and aired as TV movies, though none became fully-fledged series. &quot;Genesis II&quot; (1973) starred Alex Cord as a scientist who finds himself involved in a post-apocalyptic war after centuries spent in suspended animation. The story was recycled and retooled over two further pilot films, &quot;Planet Earth&quot; (1974) and &quot;Strange New World&quot; (1975), neither of which were successful. Roddenberry&#x27;s later &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; (1974) involves an android that disappears to seek his creator.

It was not until later in the decade, again inspired by the post-&quot;Star Wars&quot; boom of 1977 and beyond, that science fiction series began to return to prominence. One of those particularly keen on exploiting the networks’ new interest in the genre was producer Glen A. Larson, who created two new science fiction series in quick succession: his own original creation &quot;Battlestar Galactica/Galactica 1980&quot; (1978–80) and another television version of Buck Rogers, this time entitled &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; (1979–81). Both of these series had much in common. They were glossily produced on high budgets, with pilot episodes that were released theatrically into cinemas in some territories. However, both series seemed to place an emphasis on style over content, with the scripts generally being run of-the-mill action/adventure affairs with few of the more challenging concepts of science fiction of their predecessors. It is perhaps for this reason that both programs were so short lived, although they did attract highly dedicated and vociferous fan bases and do still linger to a certain extent in the popular consciousness.

A successful British science fiction series Doctor Who was syndicated in the US starting in 1972, with selected episodes of Jon Pertwee&#x27;s time as the Doctor. In 1978, Tom Baker&#x27;s first four seasons as the Doctor were sold to PBS stations across the United States.

====1980s====
Science fiction print authors didn&#x27;t usually make it onto TV. Most TV scripts were created originally for TV. One of the few famous print authors to make it to the small screen was Ray Bradbury. His collection of linked stories &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, was produced as a mini-series that first aired in 1980. Labeled as “faithful” but “bland&#x27;” it included such stars as Rock Hudson, Darren McGavin, Roddy McDowall and Bernadette Peters.

The most significant US science fiction television series of the early 1980s was the 1983 miniseries &quot;V&quot;, which aired on NBC. An allegorical tale paralleling the rise of Nazism in Germany of the 1930s with the arrival on Earth of an apparently friendly alien race with hidden motives, the miniseries proved to be highly popular and iconic, spawning both a sequel &quot;V: The Final Battle&quot; the following year, and then a full-blown television series for the 1984–1985 season, although neither of these were as successful as the original, being more action-oriented and somewhat less cerebral.

1987 saw the arrival of what is perhaps the most successful, in terms of sales and worldwide viewing figures, science fiction series of all time, Gene Roddenberry’s re-launching of his &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Taking place on a new starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; some seventy years after the events of the original series, unlike its predecessor it was not supported by a network, but instead sold directly into syndication. The program was a huge success, running for seven seasons and like the original series spawning several feature film spin-offs.

Another 1987 series was the oddball &quot;Max Headroom&quot;. Originally a British pilot film, it was picked up and re-made in America as a darkly comical drama series which followed an investigative video news journalist, Edison Carter (played by Matt Frewer) as he pursued stories and exposed scandals in a dystopian, TV-obsessed future. Edison was aided and abetted by a group of friends and colleagues, and by his electronic alter-ego, the stuttering, sarcastic iconoclast, Max Headroom. Although Max himself became something of a pop-culture phenomenon of the 1980s, the series itself was not a great success—despite being lauded for its portrayal of a world &quot;20 minutes into the future&quot;, a &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-like cyberpunk world, where TV channels and ratings wars were everything, and people (particularly those at the margins of society known as &quot;blanks&quot;, who had no record in the worldwide computer database and hence did not officially exist) were nothing.

A 1988 television series was the immensely successful British science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf. It originated from a 1980s&#x27; recurring radio sketch: Dave Hollins: Space Cadet and ran for 10 series over three time periods - Series 1-6 between 1988 and 1993, Series 7 &amp; 8 between 1997 and 1999, plus a 3-parter (Series 9) in 2008 and Series 10 in 2012. In addition to the television series, there are four bestselling novels, two pilot episodes for an American version of the show, a radio version produced for BBC Radio 7,[2] tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise. Red Dwarf was a mining ship running between Earth and Jupiter which experienced a radiation leak that kills almost all the crew. The series is based on the &quot;odd couple&quot; survivors.

In the fall of 1989, the &quot;Alien Nation&quot; television series premiered. The drama was based on the 1988 film which was written by Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon (who would become a television showrunner in his own right and would create several other science fiction television shows) and starred actor James Caan. The original film was a buddy cop action picture with a plot involving extraterrestrials who land on earth and attempt to assimilate into human society. The television series continued the storyline, but among the theme of science fiction, the writers injected other elements such as discrimination and racism into the episodes. The series lasted only one season, but it did spawn five television films, a comics series, and a number of novels.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; is less known for its television products aside from animated shows. The mega-franchises&#x27; only known live-action television productions are the spin-off movies &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and the 2019 Disney+ show &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

====1990s====

The success of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; led to further &quot;Star Trek&quot; series which took place within the same time frame: firstly &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–99) and later UPN’s &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (1994–2001) and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2001–05). All of these series have helped affirm the iconic status of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, but as well as this they helped lead to a science fiction boom of the 1990s, as many networks and production companies sought to make their own shows in a genre which had shown itself to be incredibly popular and profitable again.

Although there were many run-of-the-mill series that did not get past a single season, this boom decade for science-fiction produced many intelligently written, creative, imaginative shows that have in a very short period of time been able to establish themselves in the popular consciousness of television viewers not just in the US, but worldwide as well.

&quot;Earth 2&quot;, story, with female lead, about castaways/colonists on extrasolar planet was cancelled after first season (1994-95). &quot;&quot; also lasted just one season – 1995–96. The basic premise was space Marines defending Earth against hostile aliens. &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, on the other hand, had a star in Roy Scheider. He played Captain Nathan Bridger from 1993 to 1995. He was replaced for the 1995–96 season by Michael Ironside, who played Captain Oliver Hudson. The show was cancelled after that season.

However, one of the more successful and most artistically ambitious series of this period was &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Produced and largely written by J. Michael Straczynski with creative input by Harlan Ellison, this show attempted to create a series-long epic tale that avoided many of the clichés of the television genre. The series was highly acclaimed for its writing and its innovative visuals as the first television series to extensively use computer-generated imagery to create spectacular visual effects for an economical price. In addition, its five-season run (1993–98), the intended length of the series, was longer than any American non &quot;Star Trek&quot; space series up to that time.

=====1990s Earth-bound series=====
There were time-travel and dimension-hopping series in the vein of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (1989–93) and &quot;Sliders&quot; (1995–2000), and mysterious conspiracy thrillers such as &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1993–2002). The latter series in particular enshrined itself within the pop culture of a generation in a manner in which few television series are able, and the entire decade produced a rich vein of highly successful science fiction shows.

===21st century===

====2000s====

=====Declining interest=====
At the turn of the century, however, a change began in the type of telefantasy program that was popular with the viewing masses. Most of the genre programming to be found on the networks was horror or fantasy based rather than science-fiction as such: there was perhaps a sense that audiences were tired of science-fiction, and sought other types of programs. Others would say there was a TV exec backlash against the Genre, others would claim a media conglomerate displeasure with the costs associated with high production values needed by a good quality science fiction show. Thus the rise to production of such shows as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, its spin-off &quot;Angel&quot; and the stylistically similar &quot;Charmed&quot;. All of these were set in the real world of the present day, but involved fantastical and horrific threats to the central characters, and possessed a wit and self-awareness that had perhaps been lacking in some of their more po-faced science-fiction predecessors, not to mention much lower costs to produce.

=====Other shows=====

Nonetheless, the popularity of science fiction as a genre means that several notable programs enjoyed significant longevity. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; began in 1997 and aired 10 seasons, and is somewhat unusual in being a successful spin-off series from the 1994 movie. The series became the longest-running North American science fiction television series, which warranted two spin-offs: &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, which ran for five seasons; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, which ran for only two seasons instead of the originally-planned five. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; retained its record until &quot;Smallville&quot; completed its run with 218 episodes in 2011 and broke its record. The Sci-Fi Channel &quot;original series&quot; &quot;Farscape&quot; (which is in fact not American, but actually Australian, and premiered on the Nine Network, although the series was conceived by an American (the aforementioned Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon)), while never garnering a widespread audience, was heralded by critics and gained a dedicated fanbase, which helped the creators wrap up several story lines in the miniseries event &quot;&quot; after the show&#x27;s cancellation. The aforementioned &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; ran for four seasons, and the Sci Fi Channel aired a mini-series based on the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, whose success paved the way for the acclaimed &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, which lasted for four seasons and two movies, &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Razor&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Plan&quot;. &quot;Fringe&quot;, which featured a mad scientist character and explored alternate universes, aired for 100 episodes (2008-2013) on Fox.

The nature of science fiction as a genre and the trends of American culture allows is to explore the whole range of all types of science fiction from comedy to drama, just entertainment to socially relevant, youth to adult, soft to hard, gross to tasteful, cheap to expensive productions, and lame to thoughtful.

Despite trends in television, science fiction as a genre has firmly established its place in the make-up of American programming. The future of science fiction could be significantly helped by the advances in digital imagery, which allows for spectacular visual effects for a relatively economical price.

==Other science fiction television genres==
Two other subgenres were comic science fiction, and youth science fiction (children and teenagers). Examples of the former are &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, CBS, 1963–66; &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, ABC 1978–1982; &quot;ALF&quot;, NBC, 1986–90; and &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, NBC, 1996–2001.

There are many examples of youth science fiction. They are characterized by relatively simple plots, and characters despite lacking production value. The animated &quot;Colonel Bleep&quot; launched in 1957 and went on to a long run in first-run syndication. A British import using marionettes was &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, initially released in 1962. &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; was a rocket ship protecting Sector 25 of the Solar System. Also first released in 1962 was &quot;Space Angel&quot;, a cartoon. “Space Angel” was the code name for Scott McCloud, captain of a space ship.

&quot;The Jetsons&quot;, an animated domestic sitcom that debuted in 1962, was noted for its unusually accurate portrayal of future society. Jeffrey A. Tucker wrote in 2011 that &quot;The Jetsons&quot; is &quot;distinguished in science-fiction lore by the fact that it is a rare attempt in this genre that actually succeeds in predicting the future.&quot; Usually, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, (1964–65), was a cartoon adventure, but with science fiction technology, e.g. a rocket ship and a hovercraft. Higher production values were quite evident in the &quot;Zenon&quot; trilogy released by the Disney Channel. &quot;Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century&quot; was released in 1999, &quot;Zenon: The Zequel&quot; was released in 2001, and &quot;Zenon: Z3&quot; was released in 2004.

<doc id="1056106" wikidata="Q9202604" url="?curid=1056106" title="Dallas Sidekicks (1984–2004)">
<text>The Dallas Sidekicks were one of the longest operating professional soccer teams, either indoor or outdoor, in the United States, based in Dallas, Texas, and operating from 1984 until suspending operations following the 2003–04 season. The team was founded as a member of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. Over the years, the team played in four other leagues (CISL, WISL, PSA, and the second incarnation of the MISL). The team&#x27;s most famous player was Tatu, who was known for throwing his shirt into the stands after every goal. The team hosted the 1989 MISL All-Star Game. The team was one of the most successful franchises in indoor soccer history, making the playoffs in 16 of their 19 seasons of play. In the playoffs, the team made it to the championship game/series eight times, winning four titles.

An expansion team named after this team began play in the Professional Arena Soccer League on November 3, 2012. Home games for the new Dallas Sidekicks are played at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas.

Around noon on Feb. 13, 1989 The Dallas Sidekicks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, one hour before the Mavericks were scheduled to file suit seeking to force the Sidekicks to repay a $519,000 debt. Team president David Shuttee said the debt was from 1986, when a group of Dallas businessmen purchased the Sidekicks from Mavericks owner Donald Carter.

<doc id="1056121" wikidata="Q215927" url="?curid=1056121" title="Yeshayahu Leibowitz">
<text>Yeshayahu Leibowitz (; 29 January 1903 – 18 August 1994) was an Israeli Orthodox Jewish public intellectual and polymath. He was a professor of biochemistry, organic chemistry, and neurophysiology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as well as a prolific writer on Jewish thought and western philosophy. He was known for his outspoken views on ethics, religion, and politics. Leibowitz cautioned that the state of Israel and Zionism had become more sacred than Jewish humanist values and went on to describe Israeli conduct in the occupied Palestinian territories as &quot;Judeo-Nazi&quot; in nature while warning of the dehumanizing effect of the occupation on the victims and the oppressors.

==Biography==
Yeshayahu Leibowitz was born in Riga, Russian Empire (now in Latvia) in 1903, to a religious Zionist family. His father was a lumber trader, and his cousin was a future chess grandmaster Aron Nimzowitsch. In 1919, he studied chemistry and philosophy at the University of Berlin. After completing his doctorate in 1924, he went on to study biochemistry and medicine, receiving an MD in 1934 from the University of Basel.

He immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1935, and settled in Jerusalem. Leibowitz was married to Greta, with whom he had six children, two of whom died at young ages. His son Elia was chairman of the Tel Aviv University astrophysics department, and the longest-serving director of the Wise Observatory. Another son, Uri, was a professor of medicine at Hadassah University Medical Center. His daughter, Yiska, was a district prosecutor.

Leibowitz&#x27;s sister, Nechama Leibowitz, was a world-famous biblical scholar. Leibowitz was active until his last day. He died in his sleep on 18 August 1994. Shamai Leibowitz and Hagit Ofran are among his grandchildren.

==Academic and literary career==
Leibowitz joined the faculty of mathematics and natural science of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1936. He became a professor of biochemistry in 1941, and was promoted to the position of senior professor of organic chemistry and neurology in 1952. He taught at the Hebrew University for nearly six decades, lecturing in biochemistry, neurophysiology, philosophy, and the history of science.

Leibowitz served as the editor of the &quot;Encyclopaedia Hebraica&quot; in its early stages. Apart from his innumerable articles and essays, Leibowitz authored a wide range of books on philosophy, human values, Jewish thought, the teachings of Maimonides, and politics. Many of his lectures and discourses, including those given as part of the &quot;Broadcast University&quot; project run by Israeli Army Radio, were subsequently compiled and printed in book form. Leibowitz was a prolific letter writer, and his advice or comment was sought out widely. The first collection of his letters (in Hebrew) was published posthumously.

==Religious philosophy==
Leibowitz was an Orthodox Jew who held controversial views on the subject of &quot;halakha&quot;, or Jewish law. He wrote that the sole purpose of religious commandments was to obey God, and not to receive any kind of reward in this world or the world to come. He maintained that the reasons for religious commandments were beyond man&#x27;s understanding, as well as irrelevant, and any attempt to attribute emotional significance to the performance of &quot;mitzvot&quot; was misguided and akin to idolatry. He believed that Jews should perform mitzvot solely for the sake of worshipping God and that although they could also have incidental benefit to the one performing the mitzvah, it would only be a religiously worthy act as long as the motivation was to worship God. He denied the idea of ethical mitzvot, believing that any mitzvot which set out duties towards others were duties based on a person&#x27;s position before God rather than their position before their fellow man.

The essence of Leibowitz&#x27;s religious outlook is that a person&#x27;s faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God&#x27;s commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person&#x27;s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God&#x27;s understanding is not man&#x27;s understanding, and thus, all the questions asked of God are out of place. Leibowitz claimed that a person&#x27;s decision to believe in God (in other words: to obey him) defines or describes that person, not God.
Leibowitz viewed God as transcending all reality as humans know it, believing that as an entity God is incomparable to any other form of reality humans can encounter, and is completely separate from the material world. He viewed human history in the natural world as having no divine significance and rejected the idea that God had set out a divine purpose in history or extended some form of providence over humanity. He did not see Torah as an account of historical and scientific truths, but rather as the source of the mitzvot or commandments on how Jews are to serve God. He believed that the stories presented as factual in the Torah were simply using literary forms within the realm of human comprehension to deliver demands on how to worship God, writing that &quot;from the standpoint of religious faith, the Torah and the entirety of Holy Scripture must be conceived as a demand which transcends the range of human cognition - the demand to know God and serve him - a demand conveyed in various forms of human expression: prescriptions, vision, poetry, prayer, thought, and narrative.&quot; He believed that the Torah should not be read as a purely factual historical account, that the inclusion of any actual historical information in the Torah would be merely coincidental, and that all descriptions of God intervening in nature and history were not to be seen as factual but rather interpreted in terms of the messages they carry, as his ideas of God&#x27;s transcendence denied that there could be any such contact between holiness and the world of the profane.

One result of this approach is that faith, which is a personal commitment to obey God, cannot be challenged by the usual philosophical problem of evil or by historical events that seemingly contradict a divine presence. When someone told Leibowitz that he stopped believing in God after the Holocaust, Leibowitz answered, &quot;Then you never believed in God&quot;. If a person stops believing after an awful event, it shows that he only obeyed God because he thought he understood God&#x27;s plan, or because he expected to see a reward. But &quot;for Leibowitz, religious belief is not an explanation of life, nature, or history, or a promise of a future in this world or another, but a demand&quot;. He viewed the Holocaust as having no Jewish religious significance, as such a belief would contradict his ideas of God having no involvement in human affairs.

Leibowitz believed in the separation of state and religion, and held that mixing the two corrupted faith. He wrote that: &quot;For Judaism, only God is holy, whereas country, nation, and state lack that status. The state is not a value in itself.&quot; He condemned the veneration of Jewish shrines, cynically referring to the Western Wall as the &quot;Discotel&quot; (a play on the words &quot;discothèque&quot; and &quot;Kotel&quot;, a transliterated Hebrew word which literally means &quot;wall&quot;, but capitalized refers to the Western Wall).

He was critical of Reform Judaism, calling it a &quot;historical distortion of the Jewish religion&quot;, as well as Kabbalah, seeing them as encouraging people to not perform mitzvot for their own sake but ascribing a stated purpose to them. Reform Judaism teaches the concept of &quot;ethical monotheism&quot; and Judaism as having the mission of being a &quot;light unto the nations&quot; and Kabbalah seeks universal redemption through the performance of mitzvot. This was in contrast to Leibowitz&#x27;s idea that mitzvot should be performed solely to serve God and not for any other explicit purpose. He rebuked the concept of Tikkun olam, a Kabbalistic idea which remains popular in Reform Judaism as a basis for supporting social justice. Further, he also claimed that placing the State of Israel, Jewish history, and Jewish culture above God was committing Avodah Zara, or idol worship.

Leibowitz did not believe in the Messianic Age as traditionally understood: &quot;the profound religious meaning of the messianic idea consists in presenting a goal and a purpose towards which one must strive eternally. The Messiah is essentially he who always &quot;will come&quot;, he is the eternal future. The Messiah who comes, the Messiah of the present, is inevitably the false Messiah.&quot; He viewed the expectations of a literal Messianic Age as blurring the line between &quot;religious faith aimed at the service of God and psychological yearnings for the satisfaction of human aspirations.&quot;

In his view, prayer for personal reasons, done for the needs of the person praying, was religiously meaningless and even blasphemy, as it seeks to influence God and sees God as an agent for fulfilling human needs. In his eyes, the only legitimate form of prayer was one done to fulfill commandments without any reference to the needs of the person praying.

In contrast to his strict views on some matters, he was liberal on others. On the subject of homosexuality, for example, Leibowitz believed that despite the ban on homosexual relations in Judaism, homosexuals should do their best to remain observant Jews. Leibowitz was also an advocate of increased gender egalitarianism in Jewish practice, writing that: &quot;The halakhic decisions in Judaism barring women from public office tell us more about what &quot;actually was the case&quot; than about &quot;what ought to be&quot;&quot; and arguing that men and women should study the Torah together. 

==Views and opinions==
Although Leibowitz was a Zionist and Israeli patriot, in his later years he did not support Zionism for religious reasons but rather as an &quot;endeavor to liberate Jews from being ruled by the Gentiles.&quot; In his view, the State of Israel had no religious significance and merely served a noble political purpose by fulfilling human needs. Despite being an Orthodox Jew, the version of Zionism he espoused was totally secular in nature. In line with his view that holiness was totally separate from the material world, Leibowitz denied that the Land of Israel was holy and that the Jews had a special right to it, writing that &quot;the idea that a specific country or location has an intrinsic &#x27;holiness&#x27; is an indubitably idolatrous idea&quot; and that &quot;talk of rights is pure nonsense. No nation has a right to any land.&quot;

Originally, he had been associated with religious Zionism and looked favorably on a system of law based on halakha. In the 1930s while still in Germany, he was aligned with the Mizrachi religious Zionist movement. On Zionism, he wrote that &quot;we are presented with the opportunity and the task of realizing through and within the land of Israel the concealed power of Torah.&quot; He called for &quot;a specific and detailed halakhic code for administering the full panoply of state functions&quot; to demonstrate how religious parties would run the future Jewish state. He proposed a form of democratic halakhic Judaism. In the 1949 Knesset election, Leibowitz headed the United List of Religious Workers, which failed to win a seat. Following Israeli independence, Leibowitz moved away from religious Zionism. He was disappointed with the way the religious parties compromised with the secular government. In his view, they had prostituted themselves to the government to guard their own brand of religious sectarianism, subordinating religion to the government. He viewed the rabbinic leadership as morally corrupt. As a result, he became disillusioned with religious Zionism. His disillusionment was further bolstered by the Qibya massacre, which caused him to become more progressively critical of government policy. In his later philosophy, he became an outspoken defender of the complete separation between religion and state, which he was calling for by 1959. He came to view political involvement as having a corrupting influence on Judaism, and argued for the separation of religion and state for Judaism&#x27;s sake. He viewed politicized religion as not being truly religious, believing that it focuses less on the demands it makes on its adherents. He was among the first Israeli intellectuals to state immediately after the 1967 Six-Day War that if the occupation continued, this would lead to the decline in moral stature.

In a 1968 essay titled &quot;The Territories&quot;, Leibowitz postulated a hellish future:

The Arabs would be the working people and the Jews the administrators, inspectors, officials, and police—mainly secret police. A state ruling a hostile population of 1.5 to 2 million foreigners would necessarily become a secret-police state, with all that this implies for education, free speech and democratic institutions. The corruption characteristic of every colonial regime would also prevail in the State of Israel. The administration would suppress Arab insurgency on the one hand and acquire Arab Quislings on the other. There is also good reason to fear that the Israel Defense Forces, which has been until now a people&#x27;s army, would, as a result of being transformed into an army of occupation, degenerate, and its commanders, who will have become military governors, resemble their colleagues in other nations.

In an interview in &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper, Carlo Strenger, who knew Leibowitz personally, stated: Because of his provocativeness, it&#x27;s easy to miss Leibowitz&#x27;s profound moral seriousness and the great relevance of his thought today. He is often pigeonholed as belonging to the extreme left, which is a mistake. Leibowitz, never willing to bow to collective pressure, was the most unlikely of combinations: On the one hand he was a libertarian, an extreme form of classical liberalism, and believed that human beings should be free to determine their way of life without any state interference. On the other hand, he was an ultra-Orthodox Jew who insisted that the state and religion must be separated completely to avoid corrupting each other.

During the Mossad&#x27;s killing of the Palestinian and Arab figures after the murder of the Israeli Olympic athletes in September 1972 Leibowitz declared in a public speech at Beersheba University the following view: &quot;Whoever condemns the terrorism of the Palestinian organizations must at the same time condemn the terrorism of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.&quot; For him the Palestinian terrorist attacks abroad against Israelis were the acts of &quot;terrorism against terrorism.&quot;

Leibowitz became more harshly critical of Israeli policies following the 1982 Lebanon War. He repeatedly called for Israelis to refuse to serve in the occupied territories, and warned that Israel was turning its soldiers into &quot;Judeo-Nazis&quot;, writing that if &quot;the law . . . can allow the use of torture as a way of getting confessions out of prisoners, then this testifies to a Nazi mentality.&quot; He supported a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1993, Leibowitz was selected for the Israel Prize for Lifetime Achievement. Before the award ceremony, Leibowitz was invited to speak to the Israel Council for Israeli–Palestinian Peace, where his controversial remarks calling upon Israeli soldiers to refuse orders triggered outrage (and Yitzhak Rabin had threatened to boycott the ceremony). The jury convened to discuss the possibility of withdrawing the prize, but Leibowitz himself announced that he would refuse to accept it, because he did not want to create antagonism when receiving the prize.

<text>The French post offices in Crete were among a collection of post offices maintained by foreign countries during the late 1800s/early 1900s, after Crete had broken away from the Ottoman Empire, and until 1914 after Crete united with Greece in 1913. The offices were in Chania LA CANEE Rethymnon RETHYMNO Heraklion CANDIE Sitia SITIA Ierapetra HIERAPETRA and Agios Nikolaos SAN NICOLO; the last three were already closed end of 1899

France issued postage stamps for its offices in Crete in 1902 and 1903. The first set included 15 values, from one centime to five francs, consisting of the design of the French stamps of 1900, modified to be inscribed &quot;CRETE&quot;. This was only a partial solution, since the local currency was still in piastres, and so in 1903 the post offices issued five of the larger values surcharged with values from one to twenty piastres.

<text>Time Trax is a science fiction television series that first aired in 1993. A police officer, sent two centuries into the past to a parallel universe, must apprehend and return convicted criminals who have escaped prison in the future. This was the last new production from Lorimar Television.

==Production==
&quot;Time Trax&quot; was created by veteran Hollywood producers Harve Bennett, Jeffrey M. Hayes and Grant Rosenberg. Rosenberg came up with the original idea, which Bennett and Hayes helped craft into the final premise.

It was one of the first three original programming of the Prime Time Entertainment Network, alongside &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, and it ran between January 20, 1993, and December 3, 1994. Despite being well received by viewers, the network cancelled the series because they wanted to go in a different direction to increase their viewer base.

Despite its Washington, D.C., setting, the series was shot in Queensland, Australia, near the Warner/Roadshow Studios. It was the last series to premiere under the Lorimar Productions name.

==Premise==
In the year 2193, over a hundred criminals become fugitives of law enforcement by traveling back in time two hundred years to a parallel Universe, using a time machine called Trax. Darien Lambert is a police detective of that period who is sent back to 1993 in order to apprehend as many of the fugitives as possible. He is assisted by the Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive, or SELMA, an extremely small but very powerful computer (described as equivalent to a mainframe) disguised for the mission as a credit card; SELMA communicates through a holographic interface which takes the visual form of a woman. Lambert is also equipped with a Micro-Pellet Projection Tube disguised as a keyless car alarm remote, which can stun targets or engulf them in an energy field, rendering them transportable to the future. This process, executed by SELMA, incorporates a transmission sequence to send the criminal on his way. Dr. Mordecai Sahmbi, who was responsible for sending the fugitives to 1993, tries several times to kill Lambert.

Captain Lambert, fearing the possible consequences of altering the timeline, does not actively attempt to interfere with the natural flow of history, although he frequently leaves messages for his colleagues in 2193 (via the personals sections of assorted newspapers).

==Cast==
===Regular===
* Dale Midkiff as Captain Darien Lambert, Fugitive Retrieval Section. A police officer from the 22nd century. Born in 2160 and abandoned by his parents, he was raised in Enclave I-6 Middle City, the area formerly known as Chicago Land. As a child of his time, he has abilities superior to those of 20th-century humans: IQ 204, a speed memorization rate of 1.2 pages per second, a top speed of 8.6 seconds for 100 m, a heartbeat of 35 beats per minute and a life expectancy of 120 years, as well as mental focusing capabilities from beta wave training, including the ability to slow down the speed of visual images reaching the brain. He attended the International Police Academy at West Point, from which he graduated first in his class. In 2193, after over a hundred criminals escaped back to 1993, he is sent back to 1993 to retrieve them. 
* Elizabeth Alexander as SELMA (Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive), an advanced computer AI disguised as Darien&#x27;s credit card. Selma communicates with both a voice and a holographic interface based on a picture of Darien&#x27;s mother. Selma can place phone calls, perform medical and scientific testing as well as interface with virtually any computer including those belonging to law enforcement agencies, as well as having a vast amount of information in her database.

===Recurring===
* Peter Donat as Dr. Mordecai Sahmbi, a MIT professor and winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics for his theoretical work in the teletransportation of particle mass. Creator of the TRAX time machine. He was paid by criminals to send them to the past. In the first episode, he traveled to the past to escape Darien.
* Mia Sara as Annie Knox (Past - 20th century) and Elyssa Knox (Future - 22nd century)
** Elyssa Knox was a young prodigy, accepted to MIT at age 9. By age 17, she was Dr. Sahmbi&#x27;s most gifted student. In episode 1, she became Darien&#x27;s love interest. 
** Annie Knox: A Secret Service Agent whom Darien encounters after his arrival and in several other episodes.

A video game for the Super NES console based on the series was released on the U.S. market by Malibu Games in April 1994 (although some sources list December 1993).

A Sega Genesis version was also developed and completed, and was reviewed in major gaming publications, but it was never released by the publisher. A prototype of the Mega Drive/Genesis version in fully finished state was leaked in 2013. The Genesis version&#x27;s most notable difference is its soundtrack being composed by Tim Follin.

<text>USS &quot;Dent&quot; (DD–116) was a &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during the World War I and later served as APD-9 in World War II. She was named for Captain John H. Dent.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Dent&quot; was launched 23 March 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia; sponsored by Miss A. W. Collins, great-granddaughter of Captain Dent; and commissioned 9 September 1918.

==Service history==
&quot;Dent&quot; escorted a convoy to Ireland between 19 September and 8 November 1918, and then carried out training at Guantanamo Bay. On 1 May 1919 she got underway from New York to serve on station off Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, during the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic, a feat accomplished by a Navy seaplane. She returned to Newport on the 24th, and on 20 June she joined the escort for the yacht &quot;Imperator&quot;, carrying the President of Brazil from New York to Newport.

&quot;Dent&quot; arrived at San Pedro, California, 6 August 1919 to join the Pacific Fleet. She cruised to Hawaii as escort for with the Secretary of the Navy embarked in August, then steamed to Seattle for a Fleet Review in September. She returned to San Diego 22 September and went into reserve. She was placed in active commission again 14 December 1920, and operated with 50 percent of her complement on gunnery and torpedo practice, and in fleet maneuvers. She made a cruise to South America from 7 January to 11 March 1921, visiting Valparaíso, Chile; Costa Rica; and various ports in Mexico. &quot;Dent&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve 7 June 1922.

Recommissioned 15 May 1930, &quot;Dent&quot; acted as plane guard for carrier operations, trained reservists, and sailed for a fleet problem in the Caribbean and a visit to the United States East Coast from April to November 1934. On 18 December, she entered the Rotating Reserve at San Diego and tested ordnance until returning to active commission 10 June 1935. &quot;Dent&quot; operated along the United States West Coast and in the Hawaiian Islands until the United States entered World War II. At San Diego on 7 December 1941, she got underway the next day to screen in her high speed run to Pearl Harbor.

===World War II===
Returning to San Francisco 29 December 1941, Dent had duty with the Sound School at San Diego and operated along the U.S. West Coast on convoy duty until 27 April 1942 when she sailed for Alaskan waters. From 8 May she operated out of Dutch Harbor on convoy and patrol duty, escorting transports for the invasion of Adak 1 September. She returned to Seattle 30 January 1943 for repairs and conversion to a high-speed transport. She was reclassified APD-9, 7 March 1943.

&quot;Dent&quot; arrived at Noumea, New Caledonia 20 April 1943. She operated from this base and Espiritu Santo, landing troops in the assaults on New Georgia, Rendova, Vella Lavella, and Cape Torokina, Bougainville. After overhaul at Sydney, Australia, in November, she returned to Milne Bay, New Guinea on 17 December. While training at Cape Sudest 5 days later, she grounded on an uncharted shoal. Serious structural damage necessitated her return to Australia for repairs through January 1944.

&quot;Dent&quot; arrived at Nouméa 7 February 1944 and landed men of the 4th Marines on Emirau Island 20 March. From Milne Bay, New Guinea, she carried soldiers to the Aitape landings 22 April. Sailing from New Guinea 9 May, she returned to the Solomons to train an underwater demolition team for the invasion of the Marianas. She carried her team to Roi where they were transferred for transportation to Guam, then escorted to Saipan to carry emergency supplies of ammunition to the bombardment ships. &quot;Dent&quot; patrolled off Saipan and Tinian until early July when she escorted transports to Eniwetok and sailed for overhaul at San Diego, arriving 3 August.

From 8 November 1944 until the end of the war, &quot;Dent&quot; served with the Amphibious Training Force, Pacific Fleet, at San Diego. She sailed 20 October 1945 for the U.S. East Coast, arriving at Philadelphia 6 November. &quot;Dent&quot; was decommissioned there 4 December 1945 and sold 13 June 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Dent&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

As of 2012, no other ships of this name have served in the United States Navy.

<doc id="1056134" wikidata="Q6643757" url="?curid=1056134" title="List of towns in Scania, Sweden">
<text>The following localities in Scania, which has been one of the historical province of Sweden, were granted a charter and town privileges, mostly by the Danish king, as the province was under Danish rule up until the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658:

The local government reform of 1863 created the concept of municipalities in Sweden. The localities with town privileges were instituted as municipalities with the title of stad (city/town). In the province of Skåne they were: Ängelholm, Helsingborg, Kristianstad, Landskrona, Lund, Malmö, Simrishamn, Skanör med Falsterbo and Ystad. Trelleborg which had lost its privileges in 1619 got the title in 1867.

During the 20th century these localities were instituted as &quot;städer&quot;:

After 1951 no more &quot;städer&quot; were instituted and the local government reform of 1971 saw the abolishment of the term, replacing it with &quot;kommun&quot; for all municipalities, regardless of former status.

Today there is no official definition, but in some contexts (such as &quot;Sveriges Nationalatlas&quot;) localities with over 10,000 inhabitants are regarded as cities.

==Urban areas in order of size==
Below is a list of localities in Skåne County with a population greater than 10,000 as of 2005.

<doc id="1056144" wikidata="Q6880686" url="?curid=1056144" title="Mita Congregation">
<text>The Mita Congregation () is a Christian denomination with headquarters in Puerto Rico. The congregation has chapters in the United States, Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, El Salvador, Italy and the Dominican Republic.

They have an estimation of 100,000 members worldwide.

== History ==
The Mita Congregation was formed when Mita said that God had chosen her to found a church.

The congregation was founded in Arecibo in 1940, but in 1947 the church was relocated to Hato Rey.

Mitas, as her followers are called, believe that Juanita García Peraza was chosen by God and that she became the Prophet of the Holy Spirit in its third manifestation. First, as the omnipotent father in Jehovah, then in his beloved son Jesus Christ and in its third manifestation with a new name revealed Mita, name of the Holy Spirit of God.

According to their beliefs, the Holy Spirit once acted through Juanita García Peraza and anointed Teófilo Vargas Seín (October 23, 1921 - January 18, 2021) as the first anointed of God in what they call the new manifestation of God, the third manifestation, the Holy Trinity, the father, son and the Holy Spirit. According to the church, Vargas was renamed Aarón and before Peraza died in 1970, she called Aarón and told him to take care of his church and he was the spiritual leader of the Mita Congregation until he lost his battle to extensive cardiovascular conditions, passing away on January 18, 2021, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Aarón was very known in the church and in the communities as a very enthusiastic and people-oriented leader, spending hours and hours of his days helping those in need, visiting hospitals and visiting the poorest communities.

He&#x27;s also very known for bringing an extensive growth in the number of church members, taking it to many countries around The Americas and Europe. All this due to his vast campaigns of preachings where he would do 2, 3 and even 5 church services in one day in different communities.

The Congregation is now led by Rosinin Rodriguez, who had been named by Aarón in 2012 as his successor and the Spiritual Mother of the church.

==Doctrine==
The doctrine of the church is based on the original Reina-Valera Spanish translation of the Bible. They are trinitarian, believing in Jehovah, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit (Mita), who they believe &quot;is on earth, that His new name is Mita and that, through Aarón, He guides His Church and guides it through truth and justice towards salvation&quot;. Aarón is considered God&#x27;s prophet for today, and through him God&#x27;s message of cleansing, freedom from sin, and unity is brought to the world. &quot;Mita en Aarón&quot; (Mita in Aaron) is a slogan of the Mita Congregation.

Mita members always clarify that when they talk about &quot;Mita&quot; in their hymns or preachings they are not referring to Juanita Garcia Peraza, but referring to the new name of the Holy Spirit who, at some point in the late 40s, called Juanita by His own name.

<text>Farofa () is a type of meal made from toasted cassava. It is eaten mainly in Brazil. It can be found commercially produced and packaged but can also be prepared at home based on family recipes. Most recipes will also contain varying amounts of salt, smoked meat, and spices. The consistency of the mixture ranges from large grains the size of cracked bulgur wheat or couscous down to a table-salt-sized powder. Most &quot;farofas&quot; have a very smoky and slightly salty taste, by and large used to accentuate the taste of meat, particularly barbecued meat and hearty stews.

In Brazil, where &quot;farofa&quot; is particularly popular, typical recipes call for raw cassava flour to be toasted with abundant butter, vegetable oil or olive oil, salt, bacon, onions, garlic, sausage, or olives until golden brown. It is sometimes served as an accompaniment to Brazilian &quot;feijoada&quot; and Brazilian &quot;churrasco&quot;. In Brazil, farofa is also used in a stuffing for poultry and other dishes, usually containing raisins, nuts, and/or finely chopped sweet fruits like apples and bananas. In the state of Bahia, it is common for farofa to be prepared with dendê oil, giving it a stronger taste and a rich yellow coloring.

Farofa is served alongside the main course and can either be sprinkled on by individual diners to their taste before eating, or eaten as an accompaniment in its own right, as rice is often consumed. Besides cassava, corn meal is also used for farofa making.

In West Africa, a variant of cassava flour known as garri is used in various dishes.

<text>The SEAT 600 is a city car made in Spain by SEAT from 27 May 1957 to 3 August 1973, built under license from Fiat on the original Italian Fiat 600, designed by Dante Giacosa. It was offered in two-door saloon body style rear engine layout, although a four-door version was also offered as SEAT 800. It is considered a pop icon of the Spanish economic miracle.

Measuring only long, it was launched in 1957 at an initial price of 65,000 pesetas (€390.66) –without taxes–. SEAT manufactured up to 797,319 SEAT 600s –and 18,200 SEAT 800s– at its factory in Barcelona&#x27;s Zona Franca. Almost ten percent of the production was exported to countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Finland, Poland, and Portugal. It was the best-selling car in Spain in 1958–1966, and in 1968, and in Finland in 1971–1973.

==History==
The &quot;Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo S.A.&quot;, branded as SEAT, was born in 1950 as a joint venture of the Spanish state holding agency National Institute of Industry, six Spanish banks and Fiat. Almost all SEAT models up to 1982 were license-built Fiat-based cars, although the SEAT 1200/1430 Sport &quot;Boca negra&quot; and SEAT 133 were created in-house by SEAT in the 1970s.

Initially, some units of the original Italian model, the Fiat 600 –designed by Dante Giacosa and launched in 1955–, were imported to Spain, but soon the SEAT factory in Barcelona&#x27;s Zona Franca began its own production based on this model, under agreement with Fiat. The first SEAT 600 manufactured left the production line on 27 May 1957. This unit was registered in Madrid on 5 December 1957 with the registration plate M-184018 and was in use until February 1985. This was not the first SEAT 600 registered, since the first one was registered in Barcelona on 8 June 1957 with the registration plate B-141141. Commercialization to the general public began on 24 June 1957.

With an initial launching price of 65,000 pesetas (€390.66) –without taxes–, it was an affordable vehicle. The sales success was such that the Commercial Division had a number of pending orders equivalent to four years of production. To stop this avalanche, the down payment for each order was established for the first time, something that lasted for several years. Sales were favored by SEAT itself with the increase in production, the reduction of the price to 63,000 pesetas in 1964 –a price that was maintained until 1969– and the creation of Fiseat –SEAT&#x27;s customer financing company– in 1967, which expedited the processing of the purchase and promoted the payment in installments. With all this it became the best-selling car in Spain in 1958–1966, and in 1968. In 1971, one in every four cars circulating in the country was a SEAT 600.

Starting in March 1958, the units were delivered to the province of the client, who until then had to travel to the factory or to one of the seven subsidiaries that existed at that time. To help with personalization, there was a very extensive range of accessories: from chrome hubcaps or spoked wheels, to metal trays or roof racks to make up for the lack of storage spaces. Starting in July 1958, a fixed profile convertible body with a sliding canvas roof was also offered, which increased the price by 5,000 pesetas (€30.05). In February 1961, a commercial body appeared without rear seat or rear side windows and with a very basic finish –which made it cheaper–, to use as a small cargo vehicle or as a fleet vehicle.

In November 1965, SEAT entered the export business, shipping 150 SEAT 600s to Colombia, followed by exports to Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Finland, Poland, and Portugal. In Finland itself, the SEAT 600 D was the best-selling car in 1971–1973. When Fiat stopped manufacturing its Fiat 600 in 1969, it met demand for the model with units produced by SEAT labeled as . SEAT exported nearly 80,000 units in total, almost ten percent of total production.

SEAT manufactured up to 797,319 units of SEAT 600s until 3 August 1973. After the cessation of production, it still exported 171,500 units in complete knock-down (CKD) format, that is, completely disassembled for assembly in the destination country. Among the reasons for ending production were the thin and weak B-pillars, which made it difficult to properly install seat belts after stricter passive safety requirements came into force. It was replaced by the less successful SEAT 133, the first vehicle designed by SEAT, as a modernized derivative of the SEAT 850.

The SEAT 600 helped to start the Spanish miracle –the economic boom in Spain between 1959 and 1973– that came at the end of the slow recovery from the Spanish Civil War. It was the first car that came within the modest but rapidly growing economic means of most Spanish families from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. The vehicle has become a pop icon of the period. As of 2023, it is estimated that there are still about 10,000 in circulation in Spain, and there are more than a hundred fan clubs that organize meetings and excursions every weekend.

==Versions==
===SEAT 600===
The design of the SEAT 600 is a two-box two-door four-seater rear-engined saloon. Its two initial series are the 600 (1957–1963) –unofficially known as 600 N to differentiate it from later versions– and the 600 D (1963–1970), both distinguishable by the use of suicide doors. In 1958, the 600 received its first modification in finishes and equipment incorporating chrome overriders in the bumpers, new headlamps and light levers. The 600 D has instead the front position lights located under the main headlamps with the indicators at their height on the sides, the lock embedded in the door opening handle and the start no longer with a lever, having adopted an ignition key system located in the center of the dashboard. In 1966, the 600 D underwent a restyling incorporating bumpers with more curved lines and rubber overriders, larger seats and cream-colored wheels.

The third-series 600 E (1969–1973) has conventional doors, bigger headlamps, a more robust door locking system, the ignition lock next to the steering wheel with anti-theft system, a different grille, a storage tray, a central ashtray, new upholstery, and a luminous water temperature indicator. The final production run is the 600 L and the 600 L Especial (1972–1973), which incorporate a triangular air vent in the C-pillar to compensate the interior pressure when closing the doors.


Starting in July 1958, a fixed profile convertible body with a sliding canvas roof, called the SEAT 600 Descapotable, and starting in February 1961, a commercial body, with paneled rear side windows, without rear seat, and with a very basic finish, called the SEAT 600 Comercial, were also available.

===SEAT 800===
A slightly longer, four-door saloon version, the SEAT 800, was manufactured between October 1963 and May 1967, starting sales in January 1964. It is also known as a four-door 600, although the official designation was 800. It is the four-door derivative of the 600 D; it has front suicide doors and rear conventional doors mounted on the same B-pillar. The modification of the bodywork and painting were carried out at Carrocerías Costa in Tarrassa, after which it was incorporated into the SEAT assembly line to receive the mechanics, windows, trim and finishes. The SEAT 800 was a version developed exclusively in Spain, since it did not have a counterpart Fiat version, and up to 18,200 units were made. It had some success as a microtaxi in cities like Madrid, Bilbao or Valladolid.

===Derivatives===

Several versions derived from the SEAT 600 were manufactured with SEAT parts by other companies. Many of which were built by –the Spanish branch of Siata– but cars were also modified by other carbody makers. Among the derivatives developed by Siata Española in its factory in Tarragona, the , a commercial panel van derived form the 600 D, stands out, of which approximately 6,700 units were manufactured between 1961 and 1966 and were commercialized by SEAT. Other derivatives developed by Siata Española were:
* . A three-box saloon version with two suicide doors of which twenty-four units were manufactured in 1960.
* . A one-box nine-seater door-less beach version, with the passengers in the second and third row facing each other, of which six units were manufactured on demand with a price of 159,300 pesetas (€957,41) each.
* . A three-box sporty saloon version with two conventional doors of which 598 units were manufactured in 1960–1971.
* . A three-box two-seater sporty convertible roadster version with two conventional doors of which 228 units were manufactured in 1960–1962.
* . A compact van with cargo, passenger and mixed versions of which 8,000 units were manufactured in 1967–1972. In 1972, Motor Ibérica took over the manufacturing of the van, which continued until 1980, replacing different components with those of newer SEAT cars. Counting all versions and updates, and all the names under which it was marketed, approximately 22,700 units were manufactured.

Manufacturas Railly (MARSA), a carbody maker from Barcelona, developed the SEAT 600 Multiple, the version with SEAT parts of the Fiat 600 Multipla, a four-door six-seater MPV, but only about twenty units were sold between 1960 and 1962.

Sporty versions of the SEAT 600 prepared for automobile competition were also developed. The most common ones were prepared by Abarth, but cars were also modified by Conti, Autolinea, and Zakspeed, and were equipped with SEAT 850 or SEAT 1430 engines –tuned up to capable of reaching –, also modifying other components such as brakes or wheels. They had taken part in several competition events, driven by pilots such as .

==Technical specifications==
The SEAT 600 is a license-built Fiat 600. It has a rear-engined/rear wheel-drive layout and is technically very basic. The engine is an inline-four, water-cooled unit originally with a displacement of producing and later , yielding at 4600 rpm. It has hydraulic drum brakes on all four wheels and three-synchro (no synchro on first) four-speed manual transaxle with reverse gear. It uses 5.20 R12 tyres ––.

===Issues===
The biggest issue with the SEAT 600 is the engine&#x27;s water cooling system, which causes regular overheating when driving at low speed and overloaded –exceeding its maximum authorized mass–, something that used to be common. This is due to a radiator with little exposure to the outside air, a water pump and radiator fan driven by a weak belt, a delicate thermostat, and the common use of water as a coolant.

Neither seat belts nor side-view mirrors came as standard on any SEAT 600, which represents a safety issue. The thin and weak B-pillars did not have space or solidity to fix the robust seat belt anchors needed when stricter passive safety requirements came into force, being this one of the reasons for ending production.

==Legacy==
The was also known as (little ball), &quot;seílla&quot; or &quot;seíta&quot; (both stand for little SEAT), and (navel) –because &quot;everyone&quot; had one–.

Being such a popular vehicle, it appears extensively in the Spanish cinema of the time, even becoming the center of the plot as in the film &quot;Ya tenemos coche&quot; (1958), directed by , in which a family struggles to buy a . It is also widely used in later Spanish period films and television series depicting the era, such as in &quot;Cuéntame cómo pasó&quot; (2001–2023) in which the first car the protagonist family has is a SEAT 800. It has even appeared in the lyrics of songs, such as in the 1973 song &quot;Adelante hombre del 600&quot; by Moncho Alpuente.

It has several monuments built in its honor throughout Spain, as in Fuengirola (Málaga) –inaugurated in 2008–, Churriana de la Vega (Granada) –2011– and Martos (Jaén) –2014–.

On 9 September 2017, as the closing event of the 60th anniversary of the first , SEAT organized at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Montmeló the highest concentration of SEAT 600s ever. The &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; adjudicator confirmed that with a total of 787 SEAT 600s on parade they broke the previous world record of 344 SEATs –of any model –, achieved in 2016.

<doc id="1056160" wikidata="Q5182607" url="?curid=1056160" title="Crate training">
<text>Crate training is the process of training a pet to tolerate confinement in a dog crate or cage. Crate advocates often claim that dogs are &quot;den-dwelling&quot; animals and that a crate can become a &quot;den&quot; substitute and a familiar and safe location for the pet. Most puppies can eventually tolerate crate training if it is introduced properly. The initial stress from being confined can give way to &quot;increased feelings of security, safety, and comfort&quot; after repeated exposure to the crate. Long-term or excessive crate confinement &quot;may lead to emotional and behavioral deterioration over time.&quot; On the other hand, if properly done, crate training can play a major role in housebreaking a dog as fast as possible. Confining a dog in a crate or cage restricts its movement and freedom, If crate training is not taken seriously, the dog may start soiling around the house.

==Rationale==
Proponents of crate training argue that dogs are den animals and that the crate acts as a substitute for a den. While this is a widely held belief, there is little evidence to support it. Borchelt (1984) states:

:The average dog book refers to dogs as &quot;den dwelling&quot; animals and presumes that confining imparts a feeling of security to a puppy. Dogs, in fact, are not den dwelling animals, although in a variety of canids the dam will construct a nest (often underground) for the pups. The nest is a defense against predators and protection against inclement weather. The pups use it as a &quot;home base&quot; from which they explore, investigate and play. There is no door on the den which encloses the pups for many hours.

Nevertheless, a dog can learn to tolerate confinement in a crate and accept it as a place of comfort and safety. The Humane Society of America recommends crate training to create a place of security and comfort for a dog, while cautioning that it is not the best solution to animal behavior problems.

Crate training may also reduce stress and anxiety in a dog that later requires confinement in a crate when visiting a vet, when traveling, during recuperation from an injury, and when confinement is necessary to protect your dog while you are away for short periods of time.

== Crate selection ==

It is important to pick a crate that is the correct size for the pet and is appropriate for its purpose. Often larger crates come with some sort of divider so that a crate can grow with the pet. The correct size for a crate is just enough room for the animal to stand up without hitting their head, lay down and stretch out their paws and to turn around unimpeded. When using a crate in the home, make sure the crate is placed in a location that is comfortable. Avoid drafty areas near doors or windows, areas in the direct sunlight (which may become excessively hot), or areas adjacent to a radiator or heat source.

A crate for use at home can be larger than one used for travel. Crates used for international transport should adhere to international regulations stipulated by IATA. If the crate is too big the pet will be able to use one end for rest and sleep while using the other as a toilet, which will undermine one of the purposes of crate training.

A dog&#x27;s natural instinct is to relieve themselves outside of the area in which they eat and sleep. So if a crate is small enough that they cannot possibly defecate while having enough room to sleep well away from it, a dog will &#x27;hold it&#x27; as long as they possibly can. It is this instinct that facilitates using a crate as an aid for house training.

During air travel, an oversized cage does not permit the pet to use the sides easily as a brace during turbulence. Likewise, crates that are too small pose a health risk by restricting and preventing proper air flow and ventilation. This is of particular concern to domestic pets of a brachycephalic (short-headed) breed where the requirement is to allow extra room due to the high incidence of death in these pets during transport. Due to their shortened airways and limited ability to cool themselves through panting, overheating while traveling poses a risk to the health of such breeds.

==Training==
When crate training, it is important to use a training approach that is recommended by a reputable vet, trainer, breeder or a trusted training book.

Crate training is often practiced with new puppies as a method of house-training. Puppies naturally do not want to dirty the place where they sleep, so they will try as much as possible to hold it while they are in their crate. Of course, young puppies can not control their bladders for long: about one hour for every month of age. Owners of young dogs will have to continue to take the puppy outside frequently. The crate is the only space in the entire house that truly belongs to the dog, and if used appropriately, will become a safe haven for years to come.

Locking the dog in a crate and letting it whine, bark and attempt to escape is common but such attempts to introduce crate training may cause a negative association with crating. The dog should become slowly accustomed to the crate. This can involve making a crate an inviting place by placing small familiar toys inside, moving the pet bed into crate, leaving unwashed items of the owner&#x27;s clothing inside, rewarding pets for entering the crate and remaining inside, incorporating the crate as part of play, feeding the pet in the crate, allowing the pet to explore and use the crate until it is no longer intimidating, and eventually building to the pet sleeping in the crate overnight.

Part of proper crate or cage training requires that the pet owner observe calm and relaxed behavior around the crate. The pet will attribute any emotional responses such as raised voices or other nervous behaviors to the foreign object in their normal environment. It is important for the owner not to create any negative associations with the cage in order for the pet to accept the crate in a calm manner.

==Adverse effects==
Without proper conditioning, dogs may vocalize their distress and make efforts to escape the crates. Crating suppresses the dog&#x27;s behavior, removes the dog&#x27;s freedom of movement and is a negative punishment (removal of reward) under operant conditioning. Dogs who do not react well to negative punishment may find crating highly stressful. Long term or excessive crate confinement &quot;may lead to emotional and behavioral deterioration over time.&quot; To the extent that crating reduces the amount of exposure to different environmental and social situations, it can make dogs more reactive (fearful or aggressive) or intolerant of novel situations. Crating &quot;may significantly exacerbate the distress and emotional reactivity associated with separation distress&quot;. Behavioral problems that compels owners to crate train in the first place, may be exacerbated by the negative effects of crating.

A dog may form a strong attachment to the crate eventually, feeling comfort and safety, after the initial feeling of distress and vulnerability. One dog behaviorist has compared this behavioral effect to Stockholm syndrome. Dogs that are trained to sleep in a crate, when allowed to sleep in a bedroom, can show signs consistent with that of separation distress, suggesting that dogs may love their crate &quot;perhaps in some cases more than they love the owner.&quot; This bond with the crate may interfere with the human-animal bond and exacerbate bond-related behavior problems such as separation distress and owner-directed aggression.

Steven Lindsay in &quot;Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training&quot; states that while &quot;the role of crate confinement in the etiology of behavior problems has not been scientifically established [...] empirical impressions and logic dictate that it probably plays an important role in the development or exacerbation of many adjustment problems.&quot; He argues that &quot;the widespread practice of routinely caging a dog at night and then again during the day for periods totaling 16 to 18 hours (or more) is an extremely problematic practice that should not be condoned or encouraged, because it probably underlies the development of many adjustment problems, including aggression.&quot; The purpose of crate training, he says, &quot;should be to get the dog out of the crate as soon as possible, and to use the crate as little as possible in the service of training and space-management objectives.&quot;

==Legislation==
In Sweden, regulations forbid keeping dogs in cages or other enclosures below a certain size. Exceptions are made for some situations, such as during travels or at dog shows/trials. Even then, the dogs have to be walked every two hours or three hours. The size required for an enclosure to be exempt from such regulations starts at —about the area of a single/twin mattress—for a small dog and up to for a large dog. Similar regulations exist in Finland.

Spain forbids the practice as well, as it is considered animal cruelty by its law of animal protection and well-being like we can see on the prohibition to &quot;Use any gadget, mechanism or utensil intended to limit or impede their mobility except by veterinary prescription taking into account their well-being.&quot; as well as the mandatory to &quot;Educate and handle the animal with methods that do not cause suffering or mistreatment of the animal, nor cause states of anxiety or fear.&quot;

<doc id="1056165" wikidata="Q239177" url="?curid=1056165" title="Lennon–McCartney">
<text>Lennon–McCartney is the songwriting partnership between the English musicians John Lennon (1940–1980) and Paul McCartney (born 1942) of the Beatles. It is widely considered one of the greatest, best known and most successful musical collaborations ever by records sold, with the Beatles selling over 600 million records worldwide . Between 5 October 1962 and 8 May 1970, the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs, of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles, forming the bulk of their catalogue.

Unlike many songwriting partnerships that comprise a separate lyricist and composer, such as George and Ira Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, Kander &amp; Ebb or Elton John and Bernie Taupin, both Lennon and McCartney wrote lyrics and music. Sometimes, especially early on, they would collaborate extensively when writing songs, working &quot;eyeball to eyeball&quot; as Lennon phrased it. During the latter half of their partnership, it became more common for either of them to write most of a song on their own with minimal input from the other, and sometimes none at all. By an agreement made before the Beatles became famous, Lennon and McCartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted.

Lennon–McCartney compositions have been the subject of numerous cover versions. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot; has been recorded by more musicians than any other song.

==Meeting==
Although McCartney had previously seen and noticed Lennon in the local area without knowing who he was, the pair first met on 6 July 1957, at a local church fête, where 16-year-old Lennon was playing with his skiffle group the Quarrymen. The 15-year-old McCartney, brought along by a mutual friend, Ivan Vaughan, impressed Lennon with his ability on the guitar and his version of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot;. Soon afterwards, Lennon asked McCartney if he would join the Quarrymen; McCartney accepted. The duo&#x27;s first musical idols were the Everly Brothers, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, and they learned many of their songs and imitated their sound. Their first compositions were written at McCartney&#x27;s home (20 Forthlin Road), at Lennon&#x27;s aunt Mimi&#x27;s house (251 Menlove Avenue), or at the Liverpool Institute. They often invited friends—including George Harrison, Nigel Walley, Barbara Baker, and Lennon&#x27;s art school colleagues—to listen to performances of their new songs. The first song that Lennon and McCartney wrote together, according to Mark Lewisohn, was titled &quot;Too Bad About Sorrows&quot;.

==Writing chemistry==
Lennon said the main intention of the Beatles&#x27; music was to communicate, and that, to this effect, he and McCartney had a shared purpose. Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon–McCartney lyrics have the words &quot;you&quot; and/or &quot;your&quot; in the first line. In Lennon&#x27;s 1980 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, he said of the partnership:
Historian Todd Compton has noted that there is some truth to Lennon&#x27;s statement regarding McCartney&#x27;s optimism. However, it does not tell the whole story, as some of McCartney&#x27;s most characteristic songs are tragic, or express themes of isolation, such as &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; or &quot;For No One&quot;.

Although Lennon and McCartney often wrote independently—and many Beatles songs are primarily the work of one or the other—it was rare that a song would be completed without some input from both writers. In many instances, one writer would sketch an idea or a song fragment and take it to the other to finish or improve; in some cases, two incomplete songs or song ideas that each had worked on individually would be combined into a complete song. Often one of the pair would add a middle eight or bridge section to the other&#x27;s verse and chorus. George Martin attributed the high quality of their songwriting to the friendly rivalry between the two.

As time went on, the songs increasingly became the work of one writer or the other, often with the partner offering up only a few words or an alternative chord. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is a well-known example of a later Beatles song that includes substantial contributions by both Lennon and McCartney, where a separate song fragment by McCartney (&quot;Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head ...&quot;) was used to flesh out the middle of Lennon&#x27;s composition (&quot;I read the news today, oh boy ...&quot;). &quot;Hey Jude&quot; is another example of a later McCartney song that had input from Lennon: while auditioning the song for Lennon, when McCartney came to the lyric &quot;the movement you need is on your shoulder&quot;, McCartney assured Lennon that he would change the line—which McCartney felt was nonsensical—as soon as he could come up with a better lyric. Lennon advised McCartney to leave that line alone, saying it was one of the strongest in the song.

Though Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s collaborative efforts decreased in later years, they continued to influence one another. As Lennon stated in 1969, &quot;We write how we write now because of each other. Paul was there for five or ten years, and I wouldn&#x27;t write like I write now if it weren&#x27;t for Paul, and he wouldn&#x27;t write like he does if it weren&#x27;t for me.&quot;

==Credit variations and disputes==
===Joint credit===
When McCartney and Lennon met as teenagers and began writing songs together, they agreed that all songs written by them (whether individually or jointly) should be credited to both of them. The precise date of the agreement is unknown; however, Lennon spoke in 1980 of an informal agreement between him and McCartney made &quot;when we were fifteen or sixteen&quot;. Two songs written (primarily by Lennon) in 1957, &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot; and &quot;One After 909&quot;, were credited to the partnership when published in the following decade. The earliest Beatles recording credited to Lennon–McCartney to be officially released is &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;, recorded at home in 1960 and included on &quot;Anthology 1&quot; 35 years later.

Some other songs from the band&#x27;s early years are not credited to the partnership. &quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot;, a 1958 song that the band (then the Quarrymen) paid to record to disc, is attributed to McCartney and George Harrison. &quot;Cayenne&quot;, recorded at the same time as &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;, is a solo McCartney song. &quot;Cry for a Shadow&quot;, an instrumental recorded during the Beatles&#x27; sessions with Tony Sheridan in June 1961 (one of the only full instrumentals the group recorded), was written by Harrison and Lennon.

By 1962, the joint credit agreement was in effect. From the time of the Beatles&#x27; A&amp;R Decca audition in January that year, until Lennon&#x27;s announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the band, virtually all songs by McCartney or Lennon were published with joint credit, although, on a few of their first releases, the order was reversed (see below). The only other exceptions were a handful of the McCartney songs released by other musicians (viz. &quot;Woman&quot; by Peter and Gordon in 1966 (McCartney using Bernard Webb as a pseudonym), &quot;Cat Call&quot; by Chris Barber in 1967, and &quot;Penina&quot; by Carlos Mendes in 1969). Lennon kept the joint credit for &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;, his first single with the Plastic Ono Band.

After the partnership had ended, Lennon and McCartney each gave various accounts of their individual contribution to each jointly credited song, and sometimes claimed full authorship. Often their memories of collaboration differed, and often their own early and late interviews are in conflict. In 1972, Lennon offered &quot;Hit Parader&quot; a list of Beatles songs with comments regarding his and McCartney&#x27;s contributions to each song. In his response to the article at the time, McCartney disputed only one of Lennon&#x27;s entries.

* &quot;Help!&quot; (1965)
: Lennon described the song as co-written in 1965 interviews. In late interviews, he claimed full authorship. McCartney&#x27;s stated help was on the &quot;countermelody&quot;, estimating the song as &quot;70–30&quot; to Lennon. In 1984, McCartney said &quot;John and I wrote it at his house in Weybridge for the film.&quot;

* &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; (1965)
: In 1965, Lennon claimed that the song was &quot;three-quarters mine and Paul changed it a bit. He said let&#x27;s alter the tune.&quot; However, in 1980, Lennon said that McCartney&#x27;s contribution was limited to &quot;the way Ringo [Starr] played the drums&quot;. In &quot;Many Years from Now&quot;, McCartney said &quot;we sat down and wrote it together ... give him 60 percent of it.&quot;

* &quot;In My Life&quot; (1965)
: Lennon&#x27;s entry for &quot;In My Life&quot; was the only one that McCartney disputed in his response to the &quot;Hit Parader&quot; article. Lennon said that McCartney helped only with &quot;the middle eight&quot; of the song. McCartney said that he wrote the entire melody, taking inspiration from Smokey Robinson songs.

* &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; (1966) 
: In the 1997 biography &quot;Many Years from Now&quot;, McCartney recalled writing the music to &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; on a piano at Jane Asher&#x27;s family home in Wimpole Street, and then playing it to Donovan, who supported that the song lacked any serious lyrics at that point. In 1972, Lennon said that he wrote 70 percent of the lyrics, but Pete Shotton, Lennon&#x27;s childhood friend, remembered Lennon&#x27;s contribution as being &quot;absolutely nil&quot;. In 1985, McCartney said that Lennon had contributed &quot;about half a line&quot; to the song, but elsewhere (including a 1966 interview) he describes finishing the song with more substantial collaboration with Lennon. Harrison also contributed to this song. According to journalist Hunter Davies, the last verse was finished with all the Beatles giving suggestions in the studio.

* &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; (1966)
: McCartney claimed to have helped on the lyric, estimating the song as &quot;80–20&quot; to Lennon. In &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, Lennon did not acknowledge any contributions from McCartney.

* &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; (1967)
: In &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, Lennon said he authored the song and took the words from a circus poster. He did not acknowledge McCartney as a contributor. In 2013, McCartney recalled spending an afternoon with Lennon writing the song based on the poster: &quot;I read, occasionally, people say, &#x27;Oh, John wrote that one.&#x27; I say, &#x27;Wait a minute, what was that afternoon I spent with him, then, looking at this poster?&#x27;&quot;

===Lennon–McCartney vs McCartney–Lennon===
In October 1962, the Beatles released their first single in the UK, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, credited to &quot;Lennon–McCartney&quot;. However, on their next three releases the following year (the single &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; LP, and the single &quot;From Me to You&quot;), the credit was given as &quot;McCartney–Lennon&quot;. According to McCartney, the decision to consistently order the credit with Lennon first was made at an April 1963 band meeting. With the &quot;She Loves You&quot; single, released in August 1963, the credit reverted to &quot;Lennon–McCartney&quot;, and all subsequent official Beatles singles and albums list &quot;Lennon–McCartney&quot; (UK) or &quot;John Lennon-Paul McCartney&quot; (US) as the author of songs written by the two.

In 1976, McCartney&#x27;s band Wings released their live album &quot;Wings over America&quot; with songwriting credits for five Beatles songs reversed to place McCartney&#x27;s name first. Neither Lennon nor his wife Yoko Ono publicly objected to the flipped credits at the time. 

Many years after Lennon&#x27;s death however, in the late 1990s, McCartney and Ono became involved in a dispute over the credit order. McCartney&#x27;s 2002 live album, &quot;Back in the U.S.&quot;, also used the credit &quot;Paul McCartney and John Lennon&quot; for all of the Beatles songs. When Ono objected to McCartney&#x27;s request for the reversed credit to be used for the 1965 song &quot;Yesterday&quot;, McCartney said that he and Lennon had agreed in the past that the credits could be reversed, if either of them wanted to, on any future releases. In 2003, he relented, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m happy with the way it is and always has been. Lennon and McCartney is still the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll trademark I&#x27;m proud to be a part of – in the order it has always been.&quot; 

An in-depth analysis of the legal issues was the subject of a 66-page article in the &quot;Pepperdine Law Review&quot; in 2006.

Subsequent Paul McCartney live albums &quot;Good Evening New York City&quot; (2009) and &quot;Amoeba Gig&quot; (2019) featured original credit to Lennon-McCartney songs. The new Paul McCartney and Wings live-in-the-studio album &quot;One Hand Clapping&quot; (2024) featured reverted credits to the Beatles songs.

===Lennon–McCartney and others===
A number of songs written primarily by the duo and recorded by the Beatles were credited as follows:
*&quot;What Goes On&quot; (1965): Lennon–McCartney–Starkey
*&quot;12-Bar Original&quot; (1965): Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey
*&quot;Flying&quot; (1967): Harrison–Lennon–McCartney–Starkey
*&quot;Jessie&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1967): Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey
*&quot;Los Paranoias&quot; (1968): Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey
*&quot;Dig It&quot; (1969): Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey
*&quot;Maggie Mae&quot; (1969): Arrangement by Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey
*&quot;Suzy Parker&quot; (1969): Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey

*&quot;Christmas Time (Is Here Again)&quot; (1995 edit of 1967 fan club version): Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starkey
*&quot;Now and Then&quot; (2023): Original composition by John Lennon; Beatles version credited to John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr

The German-language versions of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; were also credited to additional songwriters for assisting with the translation. &quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand&quot; was credited to Lennon–McCartney–Nicolas–Hellmer, and &quot;Sie liebt dich&quot; was credited to Lennon–McCartney–Nicolas–Montague.

== Legacy ==
===Cultural impact===

Lennon–McCartney, as well as other British Invasion songwriters, inspired changes to the music industry because they were bands that wrote and performed their own music. This trend threatened the professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry. Ellie Greenwich, a Brill Building songwriter, said, &quot;When the Beatles and the entire British Invasion came in, we were all ready to say, &#x27;Look, it&#x27;s been nice, there&#x27;s no more room for us… It&#x27;s now the self-contained group- makes, certain type of material. What do we do?&quot; In 1963, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called Lennon and McCartney the greatest composers since Ludwig van Beethoven.

The Lennon–McCartney brand would prove to be a model for several other songwriting teams in the rock genre, including, according to Lennon, the Rolling Stones&#x27; Jagger–Richards partnership. Subsequent Beatlesque songwriting teams attracted comparisons in the media to Lennon–McCartney. The new wave band Squeeze&#x27;s partnership of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook was dubbed the &quot;new Lennon–McCartney&quot; by music writers. Difford and Tilbrook expressed ambivalence about the comparison: Tilbrook felt that they &quot;got a bit pompous&quot; as a result, while Difford noted that, although the tag was &quot;very useful&quot; to Squeeze for getting the attention of radio programmers, the label &quot;might have been a burden&quot; on Tilbrook &quot;because he had to live up to the challenge of [the Beatles&#x27;] kind of songwriting, which he didn&#x27;t need to do because he&#x27;s such an incredible songwriter in his own right.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; pondered in 1980 whether Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, the founding duo of electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, were emerging as &quot;the Lennon and McCartney of the electronic world&quot;; music journalists subsequently began to describe the pair as &quot;the Lennon–McCartney of synth-pop&quot;.

When McCartney teamed up with Elvis Costello in 1989, Costello&#x27;s acerbic style earned him comparisons to Lennon in his role as McCartney&#x27;s collaborator. McCartney, despite conceding that Costello has &quot;got a bit of Lennon in him&quot;, characterized the pairing as &quot;a new thing&quot;.

===Beatles catalogue===
The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership makes up the majority of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue. The first two UK studio albums included 12 cover tunes and 15 Lennon–McCartney songs, with one track (&quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;) credited to George Harrison. Their third UK album, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), is the only Beatles album made up entirely of Lennon–McCartney compositions. The next album released, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; (1964), included six covers and eight Lennon–McCartney originals. The subsequent release, &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), had two covers and two Harrison compositions along with ten Lennon–McCartney tracks; it was the last Beatles album to feature a non-original composition until &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which included an arrangement of the traditional Liverpool folk song &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;. Among the songs in this post-&quot;Help!&quot; output, Harrison contributed between one and four songs per album, and Ringo Starr wrote two songs in total and received a joint credit with Lennon and McCartney for a third (&quot;What Goes On&quot;). In addition, &quot;Flying&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; were credited to all four Beatles. The rest of the catalogue came from Lennon and McCartney.

Lennon and McCartney gave songs to Starr to sing, and to Harrison before he started writing his own material. As for the songs they kept for themselves, each partner mostly sang his own composition, often with the other providing harmonies, or they shared lead vocal. If each contributed a fragment to make a whole song, he might sing his portion, as in the case of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; is a rare example of a Lennon–McCartney song in which one member of the partnership was primary composer (McCartney) but the other sang lead vocal (Lennon). McCartney sings in unison with Lennon on the verses, but Lennon&#x27;s vocal is more prominent. McCartney sings the high harmony on the chorus.

In January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.

==Non-Beatles songs==
Several songs credited to Lennon–McCartney were originally released by bands other than the Beatles, especially those managed by Brian Epstein. Recording a Lennon–McCartney song helped launch new performing-artists&#x27; careers. Many of the recordings below were included on the 1979 compilation album &quot;The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away&quot;. Beatles versions of some of these were recorded; some were not released until after their split, on compilations such as &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; (1995–96).

In April 2024, the surviving Beatles sons James McCartney and Sean Ono Lennon worked together on the song &quot;Primrose Hill&quot; for McCartney&#x27;s upcoming album.

Four songs and a soundtrack album were released during this period but credited solely to Paul McCartney:
==Unreleased songs==

The following compositions are believed to have been written by Lennon and McCartney, but never officially released by the Beatles or any other artist except as noted below. Many have appeared on Beatles bootlegs, an exception being &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;. The list of unreleased songs includes some of the earliest Lennon–McCartney joint works dating back to the Quarrymen, the group that evolved into the Beatles. Several of these songs were revisited during the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions of early 1969.

<text>Aldergrove is a hamlet and townland sub-division in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It is within the townland of Seacash and parish of Killead – south of Antrim and west of Belfast. It is part of the Borough of Antrim and Newtownabbey.

The name Aldergrove is more commonly used to describe the major airfield to the north east of the hamlet. Two long runways serve both the civil Belfast International Airport and the British Army&#x27;s Aldergrove Flying Station (formerly the RAF base RAF Aldergrove).

The first jet aircraft to make a non-stop transatlantic flight flew from Aldergrove on 21 February 1951: An RAF English Electric Canberra B Mk 2 (serial number WD932) flown by Squadron Leader A Callard of the A&amp;AEE flew to Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. The flight covered almost 1,800 nautical miles (3,300 km) in four hours and 37 minutes. The aircraft was being flown to the United States to act as a pattern aircraft for the Martin B-57 Canberra.

Aldergrove railway station opened on 13 November 1871, and closed in September 1960.

<doc id="1056173" wikidata="Q1386098" url="?curid=1056173" title="Melvin Franklin">
<text>David Melvin English (October 12, 1942 – February 23, 1995) better known by the stage name Melvin Franklin or his nickname &quot;Blue&quot;, was an American bass singer. Franklin was best known for his role as a founding member of Motown singing group The Temptations from 1960 to 1995.

== Early life ==
David English was born in Montgomery, Alabama to Rose English, a teenage mother from nearby Mobile. His biological father was the preacher of the English family&#x27;s church in Mobile; he impregnated her through rape. Following David&#x27;s birth, Rose English married Willard Franklin and moved to Detroit. Her grandmother however insisted on raising young David and was left behind in her care. David English later moved to Detroit with his mother and stepfather in 1952 at age ten.

Taking on his stepfather&#x27;s surname for his stage name as a teenager, David English—now Melvin Franklin—was a member of a number of local singing groups in Detroit, including The Voice Masters with Lamont Dozier and David Ruffin, and frequently performed with Richard Street. In 1959, the Voice Masters signed with Anna Records, a label co-founded by Berry Gordy&#x27;s sister Anna. The group recorded several singles, including &quot;Needed&quot; and &quot;Hope and Pray&quot;. Franklin often affectionately referred to Street and Ruffin as his &quot;cousins&quot; (although they were not related). Around this time, Franklin romantically pursued future Supremes singer Mary Wilson.

== Career ==

===1958–1960: Early career===
In 1958, Otis Williams, a classmate of Franklin&#x27;s at Detroit&#x27;s Northwestern High School, had formed his own singing group, Otis Williams and the Siberians. The group were negotiating a contract with record producer Johnnie Mae Matthews to record singles. However, Arthur Walton, the group&#x27;s bass singer, departed the group to finish high school. To replace him, Williams remembered Franklin from the Voice Masters. He spotted Franklin walking along a nearby neighborhood and rushed him with an offer to join the group as their bass singer. Franklin responded, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t know you. You have to ask my momma.&quot; Williams explained the situation to Rose Franklin, who agreed to have her son join the group. Vernard Plain, the group&#x27;s lead singer, also departed the group, in which Franklin brought in Street to replace him.

The Siberians (now renamed Otis Williams and the Distants)—Williams, Franklin, Street, Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant, and James &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Crawford—recorded at Matthews&#x27; Northern Records, releasing singles such as &quot;Come On&quot; (1959) and &quot;Alright&quot; (1960). Around this time, Franklin briefly attended Wayne State University. A dispute over the group&#x27;s royalties with Matthews led to the termination of their contract with Northern Records. By 1960, the Distants had been reduced to a trio after Street left the group.

===1961–1995: The Temptations===
After losing the Distants name, the remaining members aligned with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks to form the Elgins. In March 1961, the Elgins signed with Motown Records under a new name: The Temptations. As a member of the Temptations, Franklin acquired the nickname &quot;Blue&quot; among his bandmates because of his obsession with the Italian song &quot;Nel blu, dipinto di blu&quot; (also known as &quot;Volare&quot; in English).

Franklin and Otis Williams were the only founding Temptations who never left the group. One of the most famous bass singers in music throughout his career, Franklin&#x27;s deep vocals became one of the group&#x27;s signature trademarks. Franklin sang a handful of featured leads with the group as well, including the songs &quot;I Truly, Truly Believe&quot; (&quot;The Temptations Wish It Would Rain&quot;, 1968), &quot;Silent Night&quot; (&quot;Give Love At Christmas&quot;, 1980), &quot;The Prophet&quot; (&quot;A Song for You&quot;, 1975), and his signature live performance number, &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. Franklin was usually called upon to deliver ad-libs, harmony vocals, and, during the psychedelic soul era, notable sections of the main verses. Franklin memorably sang the line &quot;and the band played on&quot; from The Temptations&#x27; 1970 hit single &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot;.

In the fall of 1978, Franklin was shot in the hand and leg while trying to stop a carjacking outside of a hair salon in West Hollywood. He had earlier left his vehicle running when he stopped to talk with a female friend. During the struggle, the carjacker recognized Franklin from the Temptations, pushed him out of the car, and sped off. The incident prevented Franklin from participating in the Temptations&#x27; upcoming tour of Poland, which at the time was still behind the Iron Curtain. Otis Williams assumed Franklin&#x27;s bass parts during his recovery. Aside from the Temptations, Franklin also worked as a voice actor. In 1984, he provided the voice for the character of &quot;Wheels&quot; in the animated series &quot;Pole Position&quot;. 

In 1989, Franklin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Temptations. During the summer of 1994, he was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. To save his life, surgeons operated on Franklin&#x27;s arm, but since he was immunocompromised, Franklin remained at risk for remission. A few months later, in September 1994, the Temptations received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In January 1995, Franklin&#x27;s last recording with the Temptations was &quot;Life Is But a Dream&quot; for the album &quot;For Lovers Only&quot;. Following his death, Franklin was replaced with Ray Davis. 

==Personal life and death==
Franklin was married to his second wife, Kimberly, at the time of his death. He had five children, David English Jr., Davette English, Nicqueos English, Felicia Johnson, and LaRissa Douglas. In 1968, Franklin was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, the symptoms of which he combated with cortisone so that he could continue performing. The constant use of cortisone left his immune system open to other infections and health problems; as a result, Franklin developed diabetes in the early 1980s and later contracted necrotizing fasciitis. To treat his illnesses, Franklin took oxygen tanks with him while on tour. 

In January 1995, while recording the album &quot;For Lovers Only&quot;, Ali-Ollie Woodson and Williams noticed bleeding from Franklin&#x27;s ankle on his sock. He was taken home to recover but, on February 17, Franklin fell into a coma and remained unconscious. Six days later, he died from heart failure at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, at age 52. Franklin&#x27;s funeral was widely attended, with Smokey Robinson commemorating him with the song &quot;Really Gonna Miss You&quot; (a moment recreated for &quot;The Temptations&quot; miniseries). Franklin is interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. 

In February 2013, Franklin was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as a member of the Temptations. Six months later, he was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame as a member of The Temptations.

==In popular culture==
In 1998, Franklin was portrayed by actor D. B. Woodside in the biographical miniseries &quot;The Temptations&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s death was portrayed differently from what occurred in reality, with Franklin dying outside of the kitchen near his mother&#x27;s house. Because Franklin&#x27;s death was still fresh in the minds of Otis Williams and the miniseries&#x27; creators, it was decided that they would not depict Franklin&#x27;s death accurately. 

In April 1999, Rose Franklin filed suit against Williams, Shelly Berger, David V. Picker, de Passe Entertainment, Hallmark Entertainment, and NBC for unauthorized usage of her name, image and likeness along with the false depiction of her son&#x27;s death. The lawsuit was joined with several ongoing litigation cases against the miniseries&#x27; creators, in which the judges ruled in favor of the defendants. In September 2001, the ruling was upheld at the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

<text>Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, sometimes stylized as UM, is an American rock band originally from South Bend, Indiana. The band experiments with many musical styles, including rock, metal, funk, jazz, blues, reggae, electronic, bluegrass, country, and folk. They have toured regularly and released several albums. Since 2002, they have been the headlining act and organizers of Summer Camp Music Festival, which is held annually in Three Sisters Park in Chillicothe, Illinois.

== History ==

=== Early years (1997–2000) ===
Formed by students at the University of Notre Dame in December 1997, members were guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, Johnzo West, Jeff Topp, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro. Umphrey&#x27;s McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Patience&quot; and Vince Guaraldi&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; theme &quot;Linus and Lucy,&quot; as well as songs by Phish, moe., and Grateful Dead.

According to Cummins, &quot;The origins [of the name] are of an actual person. Brendan Bayliss, our other lead singer and guitar player has a cousin ... and his name is actually Humphrey Magee but it&#x27;s not possessive with the apostrophe s ...&quot;

In mid-1998, after 8 months together, the band released their debut album, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. III.&quot; Having a released studio disc allowed them to more readily book live performances. Although long out of print, the album contains songs that remain staples of Umphrey&#x27;s live sets, such as &quot;Divisions&quot;, &quot;Phil&#x27;s Farm&quot;, &quot;FF&quot;, and &quot;All in Time&quot;.

Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag&#x27;s father became the band&#x27;s agent. A second pressing of &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. III&quot; featured Farag in the album&#x27;s inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, along with peers Ali Baba&#x27;s Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. In 1998, the band released their first live album, &quot;Songs for Older Women&quot;.

Guitarist Jake Cinninger was added to the band in September 2000. Cinninger deepened the Umphrey&#x27;s sound, and also contributed a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba&#x27;s Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Karl Engelmann, Ali Baba&#x27;s Tahini frontman. (He now fronts Asheville, North Carolina–based rock band Mother Vinegar). Shortly after Cinninger&#x27;s arrival, the band released another live album, &quot;One Fat Sucka&quot;, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.

=== Full line-up with Mike Mirro (2001–2002) ===
In 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive sessions took place in the &quot;Jimmy Stewart Ballroom&quot; of a hotel, prompting the band to call their onstage improvisational excursions &quot;Jimmy Stewarts&quot;. This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods used by many of their jam band peers.

Jake Cinninger and Joel Cummins released solo albums in 2001 and 2002, respectively. At least two songs from each of those albums are part of Umphrey&#x27;s concert repertoire.

In June 2002 the band released its first proper recording, &quot;Local Band Does OK&quot;. That summer, they played at the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival in rural Manchester, Tennessee, among over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Other artists included Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.

The band almost broke up in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of audition tapes were reviewed by the percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they had received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers.

=== &quot;Anchor Drops&quot; (2003–2005) ===
2003 was a year of change for UM. New drummer Kris Myers had to learn their extensive repertoire of originals and covers. The band continued their grueling tour schedule, logging over 150 shows for the year. The band began experimenting with a new &quot;Lego&quot; style of songwriting, which involved piecing together original sections and lifted pieces of &quot;Jimmy Stewart&quot; improvisations to create new songs, such as &quot;Ocean Billy&quot;, &quot;#5&quot;, and &quot;Wife Soup&quot;. That summer, UM entered the recording studio in Chicago for their first studio album with Myers. Later that year, the UM Live program was started by &quot;Sound Caresser&quot; Kevin Browning. Each night&#x27;s show would be offered on CD, for sale directly after the show. This soon translated into a partnership with Disc Logic for online distribution, and a few years later all of the band&#x27;s shows would be moved to UMLive.net. In November, the band released their first DVD, &quot;Live from the Lake Coast&quot;, and later that month their first official release featuring Kris Myers, &quot;Local Band Does OKlahoma&quot; (recorded on April 23 in Oklahoma City).

In 2004, the band released &quot;Anchor Drops&quot;, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both &quot;Anchor Drops&quot; and &quot;Local Band Does OK&quot;, and for the first time, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee music was available in stores all over the country. The album was said to be the &quot;sound of a band reaching maturity&quot;. Once again, Umphrey&#x27;s headed to Bonnaroo, playing a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. In July, the band was declared by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to &quot;have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes.&quot;

Starting in 2005, the band began producing Umphrey&#x27;s McGee Podcasts, an effort to provide fans with highlights of recent shows. Each podcast is around 75 minutes in length and is released about twice a month, and it has 20,000 listeners. &quot;In the Kitchen&quot; won the Jammy Award for Song of the Year. That evening, the band performed with Huey Lewis for the first time (they were also joined by Mavis Staples, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, and Jeff Coffin). That summer, the band participated in the Big Summer Classic tour, which was the first time UM played Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

=== &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot; (2006–2008) ===

On April 4, 2006, Umphrey&#x27;s released their fourth studio effort, &quot;Safety In Numbers&quot;. They appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; alongside Huey Lewis in support of the new album on May 18, 2006. The band was featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year&#x27;s Eve. &quot;The Bottom Half&quot;, a 2-disc album compiled from the &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot; sessions, was released a year later on April 3, 2007. Near the end of 2006, Umphrey&#x27;s began a program to provide complimentary tickets to audience tapers in exchange for their distributing the recordings digitally online.

A live double-album titled &quot;Live at the Murat&quot; was released on October 16, 2007. The album was recorded over two nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 6–7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The album also won a Jammy for best live album.

The band&#x27;s 2008 Halloween show was the first to feature a mash-up theme. Riffing on the idea of mash-ups popularized by DJs, they arrange new composition from 2–3 songs (a mix of covers and originals). This tradition has continued on Halloween every year since.

=== &quot;Mantis&quot; (2009–2010) ===
The album &quot;Mantis&quot; was released on January 20, 2009. The release concentrated more on the progressive style that was associated with &quot;Anchor Drops&quot;. Unlike previous albums, most of the songs went unplayed until the album was released. Later in the year, Jefferson Waful took over duties as lighting director.

In 2010, the band debuted UMBowl, an interactive concert in 4 sets (or quarters), each with a different theme. Ticket purchasers are sent ballots to vote for the selections for two quarters, while the other two quarters are based upon interactive text submissions/votes. October 3 saw the debut of the Stew Art (S2) events. Each S2 event, limited to 50 fans, was an hour-long event that had the band improvising based upon text submissions from the audience. The S2 has since become a regular feature for UMBowl.

=== &quot;Death by Stereo&quot; (2011–2014) ===
The band&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Death by Stereo,&quot; was released September 13, 2011. The album features a mix of new songs as well as old songs that the band has used in their live rotation for years, such as &quot;Hajimemashite&quot; and &quot;The Floor&quot;. With the album&#x27;s pre-order came a set of packages for super fans, including fishing trips and bar crawls with the band. The Bill Graham For A Day option for a private show became a reality, and has since inspired several follow-up events.

In 2013, the band debuted &quot;Headphones and Snowcones&quot;, a program available at their concerts which provides a soundboard feed delivered to a set of headphones via wireless receiver.

Original drummer Mike Mirro died on January 30, 2014, at age 36.

Cummins said about his contributions,

Musically, I think he was the backbone of us playing mixed meter and polyrhythm. We had a lot of fun writing sections of music together and trying to do things a little different from what was being produced then. ... When I met him, he was an incredibly accomplished drummer, but when we worked together, we talked a lot about musical theory and composition.

=== &quot;Hall of Fame Albums&quot; (2011–2020) ===
Starting in 2011, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee yearly released an album entitled &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; each year, which includes the fan-voted best songs from live shows of the previous year.

=== Recent work ===
On June 10, 2014, UM released their eighth studio album, &quot;Similar Skin&quot;, their first album released on their new music label, Nothing Too Fancy Music.

On April 7, 2015, UM released their ninth studio album, &quot;The London Session&quot;, an album recorded in one day at Abbey Road Studios. The LP includes some rerecorded versions of previously released Umphrey&#x27;s McGee songs as well as other selections.

On November 11, 2016, UM released their tenth studio album, &quot;ZONKEY&quot;, an experimental album consisting entirely of mashups from artists such as Beastie Boys, Beck, ZZ Top, Radiohead, AC/DC, Gorillaz, Nirvana, MGMT, and Ted Nugent, among others. Some of the mashups have been performed live by the band for years while some are new compositions for this record.

On December 29–31, 2016, UM returned to Chicago for a three-show New Year&#x27;s Eve run, their first such run in Chicago for the holiday since performing in the city for New Year&#x27;s Eve each year from 2000 to 2010. The shows took place at the Riviera Theatre and Aragon Ballroom.

On January 12, 2018, UM released their eleventh studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Us&quot;.

On May 18, 2018, UM released their twelfth studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot;. This was unannounced and was a surprise to fans and acted as a companion to their previous album released earlier in the year.

On July 16, 2021, UM released their thirteenth studio album, &quot;You Walked Up Shaking In Your Boots But You Stood Tall And Left A Raging Bull&quot;. This album was a compilation of introduction tracks that had been regularly played at their live shows.

On July 1, 2022, UM released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Asking For a Friend&quot;.
