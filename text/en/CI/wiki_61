<text>Pygmy marmosets are two species of small New World monkeys in the genus Cebuella. They are native to rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South America. These primates are notable for being the smallest monkeys in the world, at just over . They are generally found in evergreen and river-edge forests and are gum-feeding specialists, or gummivores.

About 83% of the pygmy marmoset population lives in stable troops of two to nine individuals, including a dominant male, a breeding female, and up to four successive litters of offspring. The modal size of a standard stable troop would be six individuals. Although most groups consist of family members, some may also include one or two additional adult members. Members of the group communicate using a complex system including vocal, chemical, and visual signals. Three main calling signals depend on the distance the call needs to travel. These monkeys may also make visual displays when threatened or to show dominance. Chemical signaling using secretions from glands on the chest and genital area allow the female to indicate to the male when she is able to reproduce. The female gives birth to twins twice a year and the parental care is shared among the group.

The pygmy marmoset has been viewed as somewhat different from typical marmosets, most of which are classified in the genera &quot;Callithrix&quot; (where they were placed in a subgenus) and &quot;Mico&quot;, and thus is accorded its own genus, &quot;Cebuella&quot;, within the family Callitrichidae. Their biggest threats are habitat loss and the pet trade.

== Evolution and taxonomy ==

Debate has arisen among primatologists concerning the proper genus in which to place the pygmy marmoset. An examination of the interstitial retinol binding protein nuclear gene (&quot;IRBP&quot;) in three marmoset species showed that &quot;Callithrix&quot; as constructed in the 1990s also needed to include &quot;C. pygmaea&quot; to be monophyletic, and that the times of separation of &quot;pygmaea&quot; and the &quot;argentata&quot; and &quot;jacchus&quot; species groups from one another are less than 5 million years ago, as might be expected for species of the same genus. However, subsequent separation of the &quot;argentata&quot; and &quot;jacchus&quot; species groups into different genera (the &quot;argentata&quot; group having been moved to &quot;Mico&quot;) justifies maintaining a separate genus for the pygmy marmosets, as &quot;Callithrix&quot; is no longer paraphyletic.

The two species described of the pygmy marmoset are:

Few morphological differences occur between these species, as they may differ only slightly in color, and they are separated only by geographical barriers, including large rivers in South America.

The evolution of this genus diverged in terms of body mass from typical primates, with a high rate of body-mass reduction. This involves large decreases in prenatal and postnatal growth rates, furthering the thought that progenesis played a role in the evolution of this animal.

== Physical description ==
Pygmy marmosets are the smallest true monkey, with a head-body length ranging from and a tail of . The average adult body weight is just over with the only sexual dimorphism of females being a little heavier. The fur colour is a mixture of brownish-gold, grey, and black on its back and head and yellow, orange, and tawny on its underparts. Its tail has black rings and its face has flecks of white on its cheeks and a white vertical line between its eyes. It has many adaptations for arboreal living, including the ability to rotate its head 180° and sharp, claw-like nails used to cling to branches and trunks of trees. Its dental morphology is adapted to feeding on gum, with specialised incisors that are used to gouge trees and stimulate sap flow. The cecum is larger than usual to allow for the greater time gum needs to break down in the stomach. Pygmy marmosets walk on all four limbs and can leap up to between branches.

== Ecology ==

=== Geographic range and habitat ===

Pygmy marmosets can be found in much of the western Amazon Basin, in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The western pygmy marmoset, &quot;C. pygmaea&quot;, occurs in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, eastern Peru, southern Colombia, and north-eastern Ecuador. The eastern pygmy marmoset, &quot;C. niveiventris&quot;, is also found in Amazonas, but also in Acre, Brazil, eastern Peru, and northern Bolivia. The distribution of both species is often limited by rivers. They typically live in the understory of the mature evergreen forests and often near rivers. Population density is correlated with food-tree availability. They can be found between ground level and about into the trees, but generally do not enter the top of the canopy. They are often found in areas having standing water for more than three months of the year.

=== Diet ===

These monkeys have a specialized diet of tree gum. They gnaw holes in the bark of appropriate trees and vines with their specialized dentition to elicit the production of gum. When the sap puddles up in the hole, they lap it up with their tongues. They also lie in wait for insects, especially butterflies, which are attracted to the sap holes. They supplement their diet with nectar and fruit. A group&#x27;s home range is , and feeding is usually concentrated on one or two trees at a time. When those become depleted, a group moves to a new home range. Brown-mantled tamarins are generally sympatric with pygmy marmosets and often raid pygmy marmosets&#x27; gum holes.

Pygmy marmosets have adapted insect-like claws, known as tegulae, to engage in a high degree of claw-clinging behaviors associated with plant exudate exploitation. Claw-clinging is primarily used during feeding, but also during plant exudate foraging.

== Behaviour ==

A pygmy marmoset group, ranging from two to nine members, contains one or two adult males and one or two adult females, including a single breeding female and her offspring. Interbirth interval ranges from 149–746 days. In contrast to other callitrichines, no relationship exists between the number of adult males and the number of infants and offspring. A significant positive relationship exists, though, between the number of juveniles and the number of adult and subadult group members. Young marmosets typically remain in the group for two consecutive birth cycles. The pygmy marmoset uses special types of communication to give alerts and warning to its family members. These include chemical, vocal, and visual types of communication. It is believed to serve to promote group cohesion and avoidance of other family groups.

=== Social systems ===

Infant pygmy marmosets, along with their parents, twins, and other siblings, form co-operative care groups. Babbling, or vocalizing, by the infant marmoset is a key part of its relationships with its family members and is a major part of its development. As the infant develops, the babbling gradually changes to resemble and eventually become adult vocalization. Many similarities are seen between the development of vocalization in infant pygmy marmosets and speech in infant humans. Vocalizing gives the infant advantages, such as increased care, and allows the entire family to coordinate their activities without seeing each other.

Siblings also participate in infant care. Infant marmosets require the most attention, so having more family members participating in the care decreases the cost for any individual and also teaches parenting skills to the juvenile marmosets. Members of the group, usually female, may even put off their own reproduction through a temporary cessation of ovulation to care for the offspring of others in the group. The ideal number of caregivers for an infant marmoset has been shown to be around five individuals. Caregivers are responsible for finding food for the infants and helping the father watch for predators.

Pygmy marmosets are not seasonal breeders and usually give birth to twins once or twice a year. Single births, however, occur in 16% and triplet births occur in 8% of pregnancies. The pygmy marmoset is usually monogamous, though some variation happens within the species in terms of breeding systems. Polyandry also occurs, as male marmosets are responsible for carrying the infants on their backs. Having a second male to carry the offspring can be beneficial, as marmoset litters are often twins and this decreases the physiological cost to any particular male. The daily range of pygmy marmosets, however, is relatively small, which decreases the rate of polyandry.

Male and female pygmy marmosets show differences in foraging and feeding behavior, although male and female dominance and aggressive behavior vary within the species. Males have less time to search out food sources and forage due to the constraints of their infant-caring responsibilities and predator vigilance. Without an infant to carry, female pygmy marmosets have greater freedom to forage, giving them an apparent feeding priority, which may serve to compensate mothers for the energetic costs of carrying and lactating for two offspring at a time. Since breeding priority is also given to females without offspring, the argument is weakened. Instead, female feeding priority may have evolved through sexual selection. Females may choose mates that invest more time in infant care and predator vigilance. Such males have less time to look for food, allowing the female feeding priority.

=== Communication ===

Pygmy marmosets are well known for their communication abilities, including an intricate system of calls. The trill is used during feeding, foraging, and when travelling and the group is close together. The J-call is a series of fast notes repeated by the caller and is used at medium distances. Both calls are used as contact calls. The long call is used when the group is spread out over distances greater than 10 m or in response to a neighboring group. The pygmy marmoset uses the trill for short-distance communication, J-calls for intermediate distances, and long calls for long distances; these have respectively decreasing frequencies. They interpret these calls not only by type, but also through subtle sonic variance, by individual calling. Research based on audio playback tests shows that calls recorded from different individuals in captivity varied significantly in all seven auditory parameters analyzed for each type of call. Behavioral responses to trills were greatest when the caller was the dominant male of the group. Responses to J-calls were greatest when the caller was the monkey&#x27;s mate or a same-sex monkey from outside the group. Varying responses to individual callers were only observed when the call was given spontaneously from another animal rather than being played back from a recording, with one exception. That exception was that male monkeys responded to playbacks of their own calls differently from those of other monkeys, when the call was played back from a familiar location. The pygmy marmoset is thought to react at first to the type of call that is being made and then adjusts its behavior slightly to react to the specific individual that is making the call. This allows the marmoset to react appropriately to all calls, but show some variation when the call gives extra information.

Environmental factors play a role in communication by affecting the frequency of the signal and how far the signal can travel and still be audible to communicate the desired message. Since pygmy marmosets are often found in the rain forest, plant life and the humid atmosphere add to the normal absorption and scattering of sound. Because low-frequency calls are affected less by the disturbances than high-frequency ones, they are used for communication across longer distances. The pygmy marmoset changes the characteristics of its calls when its social environment is changed. Adult marmosets show modifications in the structure of their calls, which mimic those of their group members. In addition to changes of existing calls, novel calls may be heard from marmosets after pairing.

Pygmy marmosets have other ways to communicate information about matters such as a female&#x27;s ovulatory state. New World monkeys do not show genital swelling during ovulation as female Old World monkeys do. Instead, a lack of female aggression towards males can serve as a signal of ovulation. Scent glands on her chest, anus, and genitals are also rubbed on surfaces, which leave chemical signals about the reproductive state of the female. Pygmy marmosets also perform visual displays such as strutting, back-arching, and piloerection when they feel threatened or to show dominance.

== Conservation ==
Both species of pygmy marmosets are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They are threatened by habitat loss in some areas of their range, and by the pet trade in others (i.e. Ecuador). Interaction between humans and pygmy marmosets is associated with a number of behavioral changes in the animal, including social play and vocalization, both of which are important to communication between animals in the species. Particularly in areas of heavy tourism, pygmy marmosets have a tendency to be less noisy, less aggressive, and less playful with other individuals. They are also pushed into higher strata of the rainforest than they would normally prefer. Tourism in areas native to the pygmy marmoset is also correlated with increased capture of the animal. Due to its small size and relatively docile nature, captured pygmy marmosets are often found in exotic pet trades. Capture causes even more behavioral variations, including a decrease in both the number and the sound level of vocalizations. Pygmy marmosets can also be found at local zoos, where they exist in groups.

== As pets ==
Finger monkeys&#x27; (pygmy marmoset) value is associated with their being the smallest primate in the world. Listed as Vulnerable to extinction, they are rare to find in the market for purchase. Prices range from $1,000 to $4,000. Generally, a pygmy marmoset&#x27;s lifespan is 15 to 20 years; they are known to have a shorter life in the wild mainly because they fall out of trees.

Another expense for these creatures as pets is the necessary essentials to maintain them. Creating an environment similar to where they are from is important. For food, these creatures as pets are often fed fruits, insects, and smaller lizards. As pets, a baby pygmy marmoset needs to be fed every two hours for at least two weeks. Understanding their natural diet is also important because it helps maintain their good health from the necessary protein, calcium, and other nutrients they need to survive.

In the United States, each state has different regulations regarding ownership of pet monkeys. Another factor that needs to be considered is that a regular veterinarian might not be able to help provide medical evaluations or care; one would need to seek out a veterinarian with a primate specialization. In South America, either importing or exporting these creatures is illegal. Understanding the laws within those countries is important when considering owning or taking care of a pygmy marmoset. Many people do not agree that pygmy marmosets should be pets. The argument is usually that they have a longer lifespan when they are in good care from a human. However, the UK RSPCA says they should &quot;not be considered as pets in the accepted sense of the word. They are wild, undomesticated animals that cannot be house trained or fully tamed&quot;.

<doc id="1064603" wikidata="Q3078732" url="?curid=1064603" title="Ancient woodland">
<text>In the United Kingdom, ancient woodland is that which has existed continuously since 1600 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (or 1750 in Scotland). The practice of planting woodland was uncommon before those dates, so a wood present in 1600 is likely to have developed naturally.

In most ancient woods, the trees and shrubs have been felled periodically as part of the management cycle. Providing that the area has remained as woodland, the stand is still considered ancient. Since it may have been cut over many times in the past, ancient woodland does not necessarily contain trees that are particularly old.

For many animal and plant species, ancient woodland sites provide the sole habitat. Furthermore, for many others, the conditions prevailing on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites. Ancient woodland in the UK, like rainforest in the tropics, serves as a refuge for rare and endangered species. Consequently, ancient woodlands are frequently described as an irreplaceable resource, or &#x27;critical natural capital&#x27;. The analogous term used in the United States, Canada and Australia (for woodlands that do contain very old trees) is &quot;old-growth forest&quot;.

Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies. Mapping of ancient woodland has been undertaken in different ways and at different times, resulting in a variable quality and availability of data across regions, although there are some efforts to standardise and update it.

==Protection==
A variety of indirect legal protections exist for many ancient woodlands, but it is not automatically the case that any given ancient woodland is protected. Some examples of ancient woodland are nationally or locally designated, for example as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Others lack such designations.

Ancient woodlands also require special consideration when they are affected by planning applications. The National Planning Policy Framework, published in 2012, represents the British government&#x27;s policy document pertaining to planning decisions affecting ancient woodlands. The irreplaceable nature of ancient woodlands is elucidated in paragraph 118 of the NPPF, which states: &quot;‘Planning permission should be refused for development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodland and the loss of aged or veteran trees found outside ancient woodland, unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss.’&quot;

==Characteristics==
The concept of ancient woodland, characterised by high plant diversity and managed through traditional practices, was developed by the ecologist Oliver Rackham in his 1980 book &quot;Ancient Woodland, its History, Vegetation and Uses in England&quot;, which he wrote following his earlier research on Hayley Wood in Cambridgeshire.

The definition of ancient woodland includes two sub-types: Ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW) and Planted ancient woodland site (PAWS).

Ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW) is composed of native tree species that have not obviously been planted. Many of these woods also exhibit features characteristic of ancient woodland, including the presence of wildlife and structures of archaeological interest.

Planted Ancient Woodland Sites (PAWS) are defined as ancient woodland sites where the native species have been partially or wholly replaced with a non-locally native species (usually but not exclusively conifers). These woodlands typically exhibit a plantation structure, characterized by even-aged crops of one or two species planted for commercial purposes. Many of these ancient woodlands were transformed into conifer plantations as a consequence of felling operations conducted during wartime. While PAWS sites may not possess the same high ecological value as ASNW, they often contain remnants of semi-natural species where shading has been less intense. This allows for the gradual restoration of more semi-natural structures through gradual thinning is often possible. Since the ecological and historical values of ancient woodland were recognized, PAWS restoration has been a priority amongst many woodland owners and governmental and non-governmental agencies. Various grant schemes have also supported this endeavor. Some restored PAWS sites are now practically indistinguishable from ASNW. There is no formal method for reclassifying restored PAWS as ASNW, although some woodland managers now use the acronym RPAWS (Restored Planted Ancient Woodland) for a restored site.

Species which are particularly characteristic of ancient woodland sites are called ancient woodland indicator species, such as bluebells, ramsons, wood anemone, yellow archangel and primrose for example, representing a type of ecological indicator. The term is more frequently applied to desiccation-sensitive plant species, and particularly lichens and bryophytes, than to animals. This is due to the slower rate at which they colonise planted woodlands, which makes them more reliable indicators of ancient woodland sites. Sequences of pollen analysis can also serve as indicators of forest continuity.

Lists of ancient woodland indicator species among vascular plants were developed by the Nature Conservancy Council (now Natural England) for each region of England, with each list containing the hundred most reliable indicators for that region. The methodology entailed the study of plants from known woodland sites, with an analysis of their occurrence patterns to determine which species were most indicative of sites from before 1600. In England this resulted in the first national Ancient Woodland Inventory, produced in the 1980s.

Although ancient woodland indicator species have been recorded in post-1600 woodlands and also in non-woodland sites such as hedgerows, it is uncommon for a site that is not ancient woodland to host a double-figure indicator species total. More recent methodologies also supplement these field observations and ecological measurements with historical data from maps and local records, which were not fully assessed in the original Nature Conservancy Council surveys.

==History==
Ancient woods were valuable properties for their landowners, serving as a source of wood fuel, timber (estovers and loppage) and forage for pigs (pannage). In southern England, hazel was particularly important for coppicing, whereby the branches were used for wattle and daub in buildings, for example. Such old coppice stumps are easily recognised for their current overgrown state, given the waning prevalence of the practice. In such overgrown coppice stools, large boles emerge from a common stump. The term &#x27;forest&#x27; originally encompassed more than simply woodland. It also referred to areas such as parkland, open heathland, upland fells, and any other territory situated between or outside of manorial freehold. These forests were the exclusive hunting preserve of the monarch or granted to nobility.

The ancient woods that were situated within forests were frequently designated as Royal Parks. These were afforded special protection against poachers and other interlopers, and subject to tolls and fines where trackways passed through them or when firewood was permitted to be collected or other licenses granted. The forest law was rigorously enforced by a hierarchy of foresters, parkers and woodwards. In English land law, it was illegal to assart any part of a royal forest. This constituted the gravest form of trespass that could be committed in a forest, being considered more egregious than mere waste. While waste involved the felling of trees, which could be replanted, assarting entailed the complete uprooting of trees within the woodland of the afforested area.

==Boundary marking==
Ancient woods were well-defined, often being surrounded by a bank and ditch, which allowed them to be more easily recognised. The bank may also support a living fence of hawthorn or blackthorn to prevent livestock or deer from entering the area. Since they are attracted by young shoots on coppice stools as a food source, they must be excluded if the coppice is to regenerate. Such indicators can still be observed in many ancient woodlands, and large forests are often subdivided into woods and coppices with banks and ditches as was the case in the past. The hedges at the margins are often overgrown and may have spread laterally due to the neglect of many years.

Many ancient woods are listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, as well as in the earlier &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. This is indicative of their significant value to early communities as a source of fuel and, moreover, as a source of food for farm animals. The boundaries are frequently described in terms of features such as large trees, streams or tracks, and even standing stones for example.

==Ancient woodland inventories==
Ancient woodland sites over in size are recorded in Ancient Woodland Inventories, compiled in the 1980s and 1990s by the Nature Conservancy Council in England, Wales, and Scotland; and maintained by its successor organisations in those countries. There was no inventory in Northern Ireland until the Woodland Trust completed one in 2006.

==Destruction==

Britain&#x27;s ancient woodland cover has diminished considerably over time. Since the 1930s almost half of the ancient broadleaved woodland in England and Wales have been planted with conifers or cleared for agricultural use. The remaining ancient semi-natural woodlands in Britain cover a mere , representing less than 20% of the total wooded area. More than eight out of ten ancient woodland sites in England and Wales are less than in area. Only 617 exceed , which is a relatively small number. Forty-six of these sites exceed .

==Management==
Most ancient woodland in the UK has been managed in some way by humans for hundreds (in some cases probably thousands) of years. Two traditional techniques are coppicing (the practice of harvesting wood by cutting trees back to ground level) and pollarding (harvesting wood at approximately human head height to prevent new shoots being eaten by grazing species such as deer). Both techniques encourage new growth while allowing the sustainable production of timber and other woodland products. During the 20th century, the use of such traditional management techniques declined, concomitant with an increase in large-scale mechanized forestry. Consequently, coppicing is now seldom practiced, and overgrown coppice stools are a common feature in many ancient woods, with their numerous trunks of similar size. These shifts in management practices have resulted in alternations to ancient woodland habitats and a loss of ancient woodland to forestry.

<text>Frederick Orlin Tremaine (January 7, 1899 – October 22, 1956) was an American science fiction magazine editor, most notably of the influential &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. He edited a number of other magazines, headed several publishing companies, and sporadically wrote fiction.

==Biography==
Frederick Orlin Tremaine was born into an old Cornish American family on January 7, 1899, in Harrisville, New York. He had two brothers, DeWitt Carlton (1900–65) and Nelson Dowd Tremaine (1907–71), and one sister, Alice Leila M. Tremaine (1912–1998).

He was a veteran of World War I.

In 1921, he graduated with a B.O. degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, Valparaiso University, Indiana. At Valparaiso, he was active in his fraternity, participated in drama, and worked on the weekly school newspaper, &quot;The Torch&quot;.

In 1932, he married Vera Evangeline Kurtz (1905–92). They were no longer together by 1940.

He was a member of the Mystery Writers of America, the Washington (D.C.) Press Club and of the Sons of the American Revolution.

He died at Westmount Sanatorium, Glen Falls, New York, after a long illness, age 57, survived by two brothers and a sister.

==Writing, editing, and publishing career==

During his junior year at Valparaiso, in the spring term, 1920, Tremaine was News Editor of the weekly school newspaper, &quot;The Torch&quot;. He served as Editor-in-Chief during his senior year of 1920–21.

His first job, post-graduation, was on the staff of a New York City newspaper. In late 1922, he was associate editor for &quot;The Eastern Underwriter&quot; in NYC.

He moved on to the Macfadden magazine conglomerate. In May 1923, he was the managing editor of Macfadden&#x27;s &quot;Brain Power&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Womanhood&quot;. On June 1, 1923, he became editor of the prestigious &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot; (retitled &quot;Macfadden Fiction-Lover&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for the October 1924 issue). In early 1924, he became editor of the flagship title &quot;True Story Magazine&quot;. He also claimed credit for laying out the first issues of &quot;True Romances&quot;, &quot;True Detective&quot;, and &quot;True Experiences&quot;. Tremaine later credited John R. Coryell as a strong influence: &quot;Coryell, approaching eighty of years of age, was fiction or story editor of the Macfadden Publications a quarter of a century ago when I first became an editor of a national magazine, and he taught me more about stories, simplicity of approach, and the technique of modern writing than any other person, before or since.&quot;

Later in 1924, he departed to become editor of &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, a tenure that lasted until mid-1926.

A sporadic fiction writer, his first known published story, &quot;One Burning Minute&quot;, received serialized newspaper syndication in August–October, 1926. Soon after, his first known pulp story, &quot;The Throwback,&quot; appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (October 1926) under the pseudonym Orlin Frederick.

In 1927, Tremaine become president of a trust that attempted to take control of the Phelps Publishing Company, publisher of &quot;New England Homestead&quot; and other magazines. The deal collapsed when financing fell through. Tremaine rebounded with another group in incorporating the Crossroads Publishing Company. A year later, he was involved in yet another publishing enterprise, the Perennial Publishing Company.

In early 1928, he was slated to be editor of a new Christian magazine, &quot;Crossroads&quot;. No issues are known of.

Later in 1929, he joined the Clayton pulp publishing chain. He edited &quot;Miss 1929&quot;, soon renamed &quot;Miss 1930&quot;. After four issues, &quot;Miss 1930&quot; was sold to Tremaine&#x27;s Perennial Publishing Company, presumably part of Tremaine&#x27;s departure from Clayton. Tremaine intended to continue editing &quot;Miss 1930&quot;, but there are no known issues for Perennial.

In late 1931, Alfred A. Cohen, publisher of &quot;Screenland&quot; and &quot;Silver Screen&quot;, purchased &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from Butterick and attempted to revive it with Tremaine as editor. No known issues were produced and the magazine was soon declared discontinued.

Tremaine returned to Clayton, editing the humor magazine &quot;Bunk&quot; (late 1932), and &quot;My Love Story Magazine&quot; (and its retitling &quot;Love Classic Magazine&quot;) (late 1932 to early 1933). At one point, Tremaine was Clayton&#x27;s editor-in-chief, but it&#x27;s unclear when.

In 1933, Clayton went bankrupt and some of its assets were purchased by publisher Street &amp; Smith. Tremaine joined Street &amp; Smith, initially to edit three of the former Clayton titles: &quot;Astounding Stories&quot; (assisted by Desmond Hall, another Clayton transfer), &quot;Clues&quot;, and &quot;Cowboy Stories&quot;. At his peak, Tremaine was responsible for seven Street &amp; Smith pulps:

* October 1933 (2 titles): &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, &quot;Clues&quot;
* November 1933 (3): added &quot;Cowboy Stories&quot;
* December 1933 (4): added &quot;Top-Notch Magazine&quot;
* March 1935 (5): added &quot;Bill Barnes, Air Adventurer&quot; [retitled &quot;Bill Barnes Air Trails&quot; (October 1935), then &quot;Air Trails&quot; (February 1937)]
* October 1935 (6): added &quot;Dynamic Adventures&quot;
* November 1935 (7): added &quot;Romance Range&quot; (retitled &quot;Romantic Range&quot; after 5 issues)
* June 1936 (6): last issue of &quot;Dynamic Adventures&quot;
* mid-1937 (5): last edited issue of &quot;Clues&quot;
* September 1937 (3): last edited issues of &quot;Astounding&quot; and &quot;Top-Notch&quot;
* December 1937 (2): last edited issue of &quot;Cowboy Stories&quot;
* late 1937 (0): last edited issues of &quot;Air Trails&quot; and &quot;Romantic Range&quot;

Tremaine and Desmond Hall founded Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s slick &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; in 1935. Hall was the listed editor.

In the December 1933 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;, Tremaine&#x27;s third as editor, his editorial &quot;Thought Variant&quot; encouraged contributing authors to seek new ideas for science fiction stories. According to Alva Rogers, &quot;the thought variant policy was largely responsible for the rapid rise of &quot;Astounding&quot; to top position in the science fiction field.&quot; During the fifty issues of the magazine he edited, Tremaine launched the careers of authors L. Sprague de Camp, Eric Frank Russell, and others. He also published stories by his brother Nelson under the pseudonym Warner van Lorne; van Lorne&#x27;s true identity was a matter of intense speculation in fandom.

As editor of &quot;Astounding&quot;, Tremaine bought such stories as H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (sold by Julius Schwartz) and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; (sold by Donald Wandrei), apparently without reading them. Tremaine permitted both tales to be severely abridged and edited by copyeditors, although Lovecraft complained vociferously only about the former (it was on this occasion that he referred to Tremaine as &quot;that god-damnn&#x27;d dung of a hyaena&quot; (Lovecraft to Robert H. Barlow, June 4, 1936 (ms, John Hay Library)).

In late 1937, Tremaine hired John W. Campbell, Jr. to replace him as editor of &quot;Astounding&quot;, while Tremaine was appointed editorial director of Street &amp; Smith, a position he held for a year before departing Street &amp; Smith during a management shake-up.

From early 1939 through at least 1941, he ran his own New York book publishing company, the Orlin Tremaine Company. (See separate listing of publications below.) On June 23, 1941, an associate editor of the firm, William M. Gibson, was convicted of extortion. He and Prince Ludovic Pignatelli of Italy had threatened the prince&#x27;s cousin, Prince Guido Pignatelli, with publishing a book that would challenge Guido&#x27;s right to his title unless they were paid $50,000. The timing roughly corresponds with the last-known publications of the Orlin Tremaine Co., but it is unknown whether the two events are related.

Simultaneous to his publishing ventures, Tremaine produced the science fiction pulp &quot;Comet&quot;, which ran five issues from December 1940 to July 1941. Also, from late 1939 through early 1940, Tremaine published four stories in pulps as diverse as &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;South Sea Stories&quot;.

During World War II, Tremaine edited &quot;Magazine Plus&quot;, distributed to war industries, and edited government manuals for the armed forces. In 1943, he was business manager for the revived children&#x27;s magazine &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;; it only lasted four issues. Thereafter, Tremaine had his most productive period as a fiction writer, contributing numerous stories to detective pulps (1944–45). A series for &quot;Detective Tales&quot; featured a character named Easy Bart.

When the war ended, Tremaine became an editor for Bartholomew House, which published the first paperback editions of Lovecraft, &quot;The Weird Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1945). He also published a revision of T. C. McClary&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebirth&quot; (first appearance in &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;) while at Bartholomew House. In less than a year, he was describing himself as a &quot;free lance writer.&quot; The current record does not indicate much success as a writer. His next known publications appeared in late 1948 and early 1949.

In 1949, he became editor of a new magazine, &quot;Southerner&quot;, and published a book, &quot;Short Story Writing&quot;. He claimed, at this time, to have published over one hundred stories.

In May 1950, Tremaine described himself as the managing editor of Macfadden Publications.

In the early 1950s, under the name Arthur Lane, Tremaine was an editorial associate for the pulp &quot;Marvel Science Stories&quot;.

His greatest success appears to have been with Street &amp; Smith, and his most lasting contribution his editorship of &quot;Astounding&quot;. The rest of his career illustrates the vicissitudes of the publishing business.

<text>Dwight Henry (born March 13, 1953) is an American politician and radio personality. A Republican, he served one term in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1989–1991), and was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Tennessee in 1990. He has also served as mayor of Cookeville, Tennessee (1985–1988), and has spent several years on the Cookeville City Council.

==Life and career==
Henry was born in Sweetwater, Tennessee. He attended Cleveland State Community College from 1971 to 1973 and then enrolled in Tennessee Technological University, graduating in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He became involved in the radio broadcasting industry and in 1985 was elected mayor of Cookeville, Tennessee.

Henry, was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1988 from the 42nd House District, a largely rural area centered on Cookeville, the site of Tennessee Tech, which had almost uniformly supported Democrats in the past.

When it became apparent that no prominent Republicans were going to challenge popular incumbent Tennessee governor Ned McWherter for re-election in 1990, Henry entered the fray, winning the primary election easily, apparently with the understanding that his chances of defeating McWherter in the general election were incredibly low, and that McWherter, a moderate who was also supported by many prominent Republicans, including many of their major contributors and fund raisers, would control the vast majority of all financial contributions made to the race. Henry&#x27;s appeal was essentially solely to Republican straight-ticket voters and conservatives, and he received only about one-third of the votes in the November general election.

Henry was the youngest man ever elected to the office of mayor in Cookeville but is not the only record breaker in the Henry household. After taking office, his daughter, Brittany Kylene Henry became the first baby born to a mayor of Cookeville while he was still in office.

Henry ran for the State House again in 2000, but lost the general election to Jere Hargrove.

<doc id="1064653" wikidata="Q5438057" url="?curid=1064653" title="Faucett Perú Flight 251">
<text>Faucett Perú Flight 251 refers to a Boeing 737-200 that was operating a domestic scheduled Lima–Arequipa–Tacna passenger service and crashed on 29 February 1996, while completing the first leg, on approach to Rodríguez Ballón International Airport. All 123 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft lost their lives in the accident. It is the deadliest aviation accident that occurred on Peruvian soil.

== Aircraft and crew==

The aircraft involved in the accident was a Boeing 737-222, tail number OB-1451, c/n 19072, that had its maiden flight on 21 October 1968. Equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-7B engines, the airplane started its commercial career on 28 October 1968, when it was delivered new to United Airlines and registered N9034U. 

Re-registered N73714 on 14 June 1971 when Aloha Airlines took possession of the airplane until late , when it was transferred to Air California with the same registration. Air California was rebranded AirCal in , and the aircraft was re-registered again to N459AC. Following the absorption of AirCal into American Airlines, the airplane continued its career with this carrier until Braniff Inc. received it, with the same registration, on 2 March 1989, later going to AL AC 2 Corp, on 15 May 1990. 

Finally, the aircraft was delivered to Faucett on 15 July 1991, and registered OB-1451. The airframe was old at the time of the accident. On its final flight, it was piloted by Captain Juan Mayta Basurto and First Officer Julio Paz Castillo; both pilots were properly qualified to fly the 737.

== Description ==

Inbound from Jorge Chávez International Airport, the aircraft was on a VOR/DME approach to Rodríguez Ballón International Airport&#x27;s runway 09, at night, in rain and mist, with thunderstorms reported in the area. 

The flight crew asked for the lights of the runway to be brightened as they could not see them when they should on normal approach, receiving a response from air traffic controllers that they were at full intensity. The airplane crashed into hills at —the airport elevation is —, at 20:25, approximately short of the runway and off Arequipa. The aft section broke off on impact, and the main fuselage section continued to fly past the initial ridge and impacted near the top of the second one. The tail section fell into a crevasse between the two ridges.

There were 123 people aboard the aircraft, of whom 117 were passengers. The nationalities of the victims were as follows:

Among those killed was Juan Lorenzo de Szyszlo, a dual American-Peruvian citizen aged 36, who was the second son of renowned Peruvian painter Fernando de Szyszlo and his wife, the poet Blanca Varela. Lorenzo was reportedly heading to Arequipa to oversee an exhibition of his father&#x27;s work there.

==Investigation==
The investigation was assisted by representatives from the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, as well as Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney, all of whom arrived at the scene of the crash by 1 March. The aircraft&#x27;s flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were retrieved from the wreckage and on 5 March were sent to Washington D.C. for analysis by the NTSB.

Early press coverage reported that the FDR and CVR were already yielding information. However, while the FDR was found to be usable, the partly-burned and partly-damaged CVR had its magnetic tape broken at its beginning, and only isolated Spanish-language voices could be heard. These were seemingly recorded inside a hangar, possibly during maintenance, and thus no recording of the flight crew&#x27;s final voices before the crash was made. The airline claimed to have acquired the CVR in July 1995 and to have done maintenance on it in two occasions immediately prior to the crash (December 1995 and February 1996), however, the CVR had not been maintained in six years, showing in its interior registry that the date of its last opening was December 1989. 

It was found that the crew had been issued an outdated barometric altimeter setting after bypassing an ILS signal, causing them to fly almost lower than the altitude they believed they were flying at. In fact, they had the wrong impression the aircraft was flying at , when it actually was at , some below the glideslope.

<doc id="1064656" wikidata="Q2332243" url="?curid=1064656" title="Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus">
<text>Vancomycin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (VRSA) are strains of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; that have acquired resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. Bacteria can acquire resistance genes either by random mutation or through the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another. Resistance genes interfere with the normal antibiotic function and allow bacteria to grow in the presence of the antibiotic. Resistance in VRSA is conferred by the plasmid-mediated &quot;vanA&quot; gene and operon. Although VRSA infections are uncommon, VRSA is often resistant to other types of antibiotics and a potential threat to public health because treatment options are limited. VRSA is resistant to many of the standard drugs used to treat &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections. Furthermore, resistance can be transferred from one bacterium to another.

==Mechanism of acquired resistance==
Vancomycin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; was first reported in the United States in 2002. To date, documented cases of VRSA have acquired resistance through uptake of a vancomycin resistance gene cluster from &quot;Enterococcus&quot; (i.e. VRE). The acquired mechanism is typically the &quot;vanA&quot; gene and operon from a plasmid in &quot;Enterococcus faecium&quot; or &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;. 

This mechanism differs from strains of vancomycin-intermediate &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (VISA), which appear to develop elevated MICs to vancomycin through sequential mutations resulting in a thicker cell wall and the synthesis of excess amounts of -ala--ala residues.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of vancomycin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (VRSA) is performed by performing susceptibility testing on a single &quot;S. aureus&quot; isolate to vancomycin. This is accomplished by first assessing the isolate&#x27;s minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using standard laboratory methods, including disc diffusion, gradient strip diffusion, and automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems. Once the MIC is known, resistance is determined by comparing the MIC with established breakpoints.

Resistant or &quot;R&quot; designations are assigned based on agreed upon values called breakpoints. Breakpoints are published by standards development organizations such as the U.S. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing.

==Treatment of infection==

When the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin is , alternative antibiotics should be used. The approach is to treat with at least one agent to which the bacteria known to be susceptible by &quot;in vitro&quot; testing. The agents that are used include daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, ceftaroline, and quinupristin–dalfopristin. For people with methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) bacteremia in the setting of vancomycin failure the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends high-dose daptomycin, if the isolate is susceptible, in combination with another agent (e.g., gentamicin, rifampin, linezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or a beta-lactam antibiotic).

==History==
Three classes of vancomycin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; have emerged that differ in vancomycin susceptibilities: vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (hVISA), and high-level vancomycin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VRSA).

===Vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA)===
Vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA) ( or ) was first identified in Japan in 1996 and has since been found in hospitals elsewhere in Asia, as well as in the United Kingdom, France, the U.S., and Brazil. It is also termed GISA (glycopeptide-intermediate &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;), indicating resistance to all glycopeptide antibiotics. These bacterial strains present a thickening of the cell wall, which is believed to reduce the ability of vancomycin to diffuse into the division septum of the cell required for effective vancomycin treatment.
===Vancomycin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VRSA)===
High-level vancomycin resistance in &quot;S. aureus&quot; has rarely been reported. &quot;In vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; experiments reported in 1992 demonstrated that vancomycin resistance genes from &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; could be transferred by gene transfer to &quot;S. aureus&quot;, conferring high-level vancomycin resistance to &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Until 2002 such a genetic transfer was not reported for wild &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains. In 2002, a VRSA strain ( or ) was isolated from a patient in Michigan. The isolate contained the &quot;mecA&quot; gene for methicillin resistance. Vancomycin MICs of the VRSA isolate were consistent with the VanA phenotype of &quot;Enterococcus&quot; species, and the presence of the &quot;vanA&quot; gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The DNA sequence of the VRSA &quot;vanA&quot; gene was identical to that of a vancomycin-resistant strain of &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; recovered from the same catheter tip. The &quot;vanA&quot; gene was later found to be encoded within a transposon located on a plasmid carried by the VRSA isolate. This transposon, Tn&quot;1546&quot;, confers &quot;vanA&quot;-type vancomycin resistance in enterococci.

As of 2019, 52 VRSA strains have been identified in the United States, India, Iran, Pakistan, Brazil, and Portugal.

===Heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA)===
The definition of hVISA according to Hiramatsu et al. is a strain of Staphylococcus aureus that gives resistance to vancomycin at a frequency of 10−6 colonies or even higher.

<text>David A. Kyle (February 14, 1919 – September 18, 2016) was an American science fiction writer and member of science fiction fandom.

==Professional career==

Kyle served as a reporter in the Air Force Reserves with the rank of lieutenant colonel, writing civil defense material, while working at radio station WPDM in Potsdam, New York.

With Martin Greenberg, Kyle founded Gnome Press in 1948. He wrote two pictorial histories of science fiction (&quot;A Pictorial History of Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Illustrated Book of Science Fiction Ideas and Dreams&quot;) and three licensed novels set in the Lensman universe (&quot;The Dragon Lensman&quot;, &quot;Lensman from Rigel&quot; and &quot;Z-Lensman&quot;).

He appeared with Paul Levinson, Greg Bear and many others on the History Channel&#x27;s 2002 documentary, &quot;Fantastic Voyage: Evolution of Science Fiction&quot;. He died at the age of 97 on September 18, 2016.

==Fandom==

Kyle, an active fan since the earliest days of organized science fiction fandom, was an original member of New York&#x27;s Futurians. In 1936, he published &quot;The Fantasy World&quot;, possibly the first comics fanzine.

He attended the first Worldcon, and both wrote and printed the &quot;Yellow Pamphlet&quot; condemning the organizers. The manifesto led chairman Sam Moskowitz to ban several prominent members of the Futurians from that convention.

Kyle chaired the 1956 14th World Science Fiction Convention (NyCon II), an incident at which inspired the fan catchphrase, &quot;Dave Kyle says you can&#x27;t sit here.&quot; He was created a Knight of The Order of Saint Fantony in 1961, and was awarded the Big Heart Award in 1973. Kyle was also Fan Guest of Honor at ConStellation, the 41st World Science Fiction Convention, in 1983.

In addition, he wrote hundreds of articles for various fanzines, including regular articles for Richard and Nicki Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Mimosa&quot;.

Kyle married another fan, Ruth Evelyn Landis (whom he had met through fandom), on August 31, 1957; for their honeymoon they flew to England for the 1957 Worldcon there, together with 53 friends and in-laws, on a specially chartered flight. They remained married until her death on January 5, 2011. They had a son Arthur and a daughter Kerry.

<doc id="1064671" wikidata="Q23015579" url="?curid=1064671" title="Glyptodont">
<text>Glyptodonts are an extinct clade of large, heavily armoured armadillos, reaching up to in height, and maximum body masses of around 2 tonnes. They had short, deep skulls, a fused vertebral column, and a large bony carapace made up of hundreds of individual scutes. Some glyptodonts had clubbed tails, similar to ankylosaurid dinosaurs.

The earliest widely recognised fossils of glyptodonts in South America are known from the late Eocene, around 38 million years ago, and they spread to southern North America after the continents became connected around 2.7 million years ago. The best-known genus within the group is &quot;Glyptodon.&quot;

Glyptodonts were historically considered to constitute the distinct family Glyptodontidae, with their relationships to modern armadillos being contested. In 2016, an analysis of the mitochondrial genome of &quot;Doedicurus&quot; found that it was, in fact, nested within the modern armadillos as the sister group of a clade consisting of Chlamyphorinae (fairy armadillos) and Tolypeutinae (giant, three-banded and naked-tailed armadillos). For this reason, glyptodonts and all armadillos but &quot;Dasypus&quot; (long-nosed or naked-tailed armadillos) were relocated to a new family, Chlamyphoridae, and glyptodonts were demoted to the subfamily Glyptodontinae. Other authors have continued to use Glyptodontidae. Based on the morphology of the inner ear, a close relationship with pampatheres has also been proposed.

Glyptodonts abruptly became extinct approximately 12,000 years ago at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, along with most other large animals in the Americas. Evidence has been found suggesting that they were hunted by recently arrived Paleoindians, which may have played a role in their extinction.

== Evolution ==
Glyptodonts first evolved during the Eocene in South America, which remained their center of species diversity. For example, an Early Miocene glyptodont with many primitive features (comparatively to other species), &quot;Parapropalaehoplophorus septentrionalis,&quot; was discovered at a now-elevated site in Chile and described in 2007. After the Isthmus of Panama formed about three million years ago, the genus &quot;Glyptotherium&quot; spread north as part of the Great American Interchange, as did pampatheres, armadillos and a number of other types of xenarthrans (e.g., ground sloths).





Analysis of inner ear morphology corroborates this position, while also finding that pampatheres are the closest relatives of glyptodonts:
Glyptodonts are divided into two major groups, which split during or prior to the Early Miocene. The first is the traditional Glyptodontinae, which is includes the well known genera of &quot;Glyptodon&quot; and &quot;Glyptotherium&quot;, which probably originated in Northern South America, while the second is the unnamed &quot;Austral clade&quot;, containing the majority of glyptodont diversity, which as the name suggests probably originated in Southern South America.

Cladogram after Barasoain et al. 2022:
== Description ==
The largest glyptodonts like &quot;Doedicurus&quot; reached a height of and in length, with a body mass of over two tonnes. The body of glyptodonts was covered in a large immobile carapace made up of hundreds of bony scutes/osteoderms, with the underside of the body and the top of the head also being protected with osteoderms. This protection reached a thickness of . The vertebrae of the back were extensively fused to each other. The limbs were short and robustly built, with the pectoral girdle being wide. The head was short and blunt, with deep jaws. The teeth were grooved, and were evergrowing. The tail was covered in rings composed of osteoderms, which allowed the tail to flex. In many glyptodonts (members of the &quot;Austral clade&quot; other than &quot;Propalaehoplophorus&quot; and &quot;Eucinepeltus&quot;), the end of the tail was covered in a completely fused &quot;caudal tube&quot;. The end of caudal tubes of at least some glyptodonts are covered in depressions which in life are suggested to have been anchoring points for horny, likely keratinous spikes, allowing for the tail to function as an effective weapon when swung. These &quot;tail clubs&quot; are similar in construction to those of ankylosaurid dinosaurs.

== Ecology ==
Glyptodonts are thought to have been herbivores that fed on low lying vegetation, with mixed feeding or grazing based diets. Some glyptodonts were likely selective feeders, while others were likely bulk feeders. Damage to some glyptodont carapaces suggested to be caused by tail club impacts suggests that tail clubs may have been used in combat between rival males.
== Extinction ==

At the end of the Late Pleistocene, all then-living glyptodont species, which belonged to the genera &quot;Glyptodon, Hoplophorus, Glyptotherium, Panochthus, Doedicurus and Neosclerocalyptus&quot;, abruptly became extinct around 12,000 years ago as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, simultaneously with the vast majority of other large mammals in the Americas. These extinctions followed the first arrival of humans in the Americas, and the importance of human vs climatic factors in these extinctions has been the subject of contention. Several sites across South America are suggested to document hunting of glyptodonts by the recently arrived Paleoindians, which may have played a role in their extinction. At the Muaco and Taima-Taima sites in Falcón State in northwestern Venezuela, several skulls of &quot;Glyptotherium&quot; display distinctive fracture marks on the skull roof that occurred around the time of death, suggested to have been caused by a deliberate percussive blow to a relatively thin part of the skull by a club or stone tool.

In 1983, she took over from Kathleen Moloney as the editor-in-chief of &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, a change under which the magazine &quot;acquired an edgier and more literary and experimental tone.&quot; During her time at &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, McCarthy edited four anthologies of stories from the magazine (&quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Wonders of the World&quot; (1982), &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Aliens &amp; Outworlders&quot; (1983), &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Space of Her Own&quot; (1984) and &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Fantasy!&quot; (1985)), and received the 1984 Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor (she was nominated for this award three times). She left the magazine in 1985 and was succeeded by Gardner Dozois.

After leaving &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, McCarthy became an editor for Bantam in 1985 and co-edited the first two volumes of that publisher&#x27;s &quot;Full Spectrum&quot; anthology series with Lou Aronica, &quot;et al.&quot; Upon leaving Bantam in 1988, she began working as a literary agent, first with Scott Meredith, then with Scovil Chichak Galen, and now as an independent. In addition, she was the fiction editor of &quot;Realms of Fantasy&quot; magazine from its debut in 1994 until its closure after the October 2011 issue.

<text>Cyanotoxins are toxins produced by cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae). Cyanobacteria are found almost everywhere, but particularly in lakes and in the ocean where, under high concentration of phosphorus conditions, they reproduce exponentially to form blooms. Blooming cyanobacteria can produce cyanotoxins in such concentrations that they can poison and even kill animals and humans. Cyanotoxins can also accumulate in other animals such as fish and shellfish, and cause poisonings such as shellfish poisoning.

Some of the most powerful natural poisons known are cyanotoxins. They include potent neurotoxins, hepatotoxins, cytotoxins, and endotoxins. The &quot;cyano&quot; in the term cyanobacteria refers to its colour, not to its relation to cyanides, though cyanobacteria can catabolize hydrogen cyanide during nitrogen fixation.

Exposure to cyanobacteria can result in gastro-intestinal and hayfever symptoms or pruritic skin rashes. Exposure to the cyanobacteria neurotoxin BMAA may be an environmental cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There is also an interest in the military potential of biological neurotoxins such as cyanotoxins, which &quot;have gained increasing significance as potential candidates for weaponization.&quot;

The first published report that blue-green algae or cyanobacteria could have lethal effects appeared in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1878. George Francis described the algal bloom he observed in the estuary of the Murray River in Australia, as &quot;a thick scum like green oil paint, some two to six inches thick.&quot; Wildlife which drank the water died rapidly and terribly. Most reported incidents of poisoning by microalgal toxins have occurred in freshwater environments, and they are becoming more common and widespread. For example, thousands of ducks and geese died drinking contaminated water in the midwestern United States. In 2010, for the first time, marine mammals were reported to have died from ingesting cyanotoxins.

==Background==

Cyanobacteria are ecologically one of the most prolific groups of phototrophic prokaryotes in both marine and freshwater habitats. Both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of cyanobacteria are of considerable significance. They are important primary producers as well as an immense source of several secondary products, including an array of toxic compounds known as cyanotoxins. Abundant growth of cyanobacteria in freshwater, estuarine, and coastal ecosystems due to increased anthropogenic eutrophication and global climate change has created serious concern toward harmful bloom formation and surface water contamination.

Cyanobacteria are considered the oldest groups of photosynthetic prokaryotes and possibly appeared on the Earth about 3.5 billion years ago. They are ubiquitous in nature and thrive in a variety of ecological niches ranging from desert to hot springs and ice-cold water. Cyanobacteria are an immense source of several secondary natural products with applications in the food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agriculture, and energy sectors. Moreover, some species of cyanobacteria grow vigorously and form a dominant microflora in terms of their biomass and productivity in specific ecosystems. Bloom formations due to excessive growth of certain cyanobacteria followed by the production of toxic compounds have been reported in many eutrophic to hypertrophic lakes, ponds, and rivers throughout the world.

A range of toxic secondary compounds, called cyanotoxins, have been reported from cyanobacteria inhabiting freshwater and marine ecosystems. These toxic compounds are highly detrimental for survival of several aquatic organisms, wild and/or domestic animals, and humans. Aquatic organisms, including plants and animals, as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton inhabiting under toxic bloom rich ecosystems, are directly exposed to the harmful effects of different cyanotoxins. The intoxication occurring in wild and/or domestic animals and humans is either due to direct ingestion of cells of toxin producing cyanobacteria or the consumption of drinking water contaminated with cyanotoxins. The toxicity of different cyanotoxins is directly proportional to the growth of cyanobacteria and the extent of their toxin production. It has been shown that the growth of different cyanobacteria and their toxin biosynthesis is greatly influenced by different abiotic factors such as light intensity, temperature, short wavelength radiations, pH, and nutrients. Global warming and temperature gradients can significantly change species composition and favor blooms of toxic phytoplanktons.

It has been assumed that cyanotoxins play an important role in chemical defense mechanisms giving survival advantages to the cyanobacteria over other microbes or deterring predation by higher trophic levels. Cyanotoxins may also take part in chemical signalling.

Cyanotoxins are produced by cyanobacteria, a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis. The prefix &quot;cyan&quot; comes from the Greek meaning &quot;a dark blue substance&quot;, and usually indicates any of a number of colours in the blue/green range of the spectrum. Cyanobacteria are commonly referred to as &quot;blue-green algae&quot;. Traditionally they were thought of as a form of algae, and were introduced as such in older textbooks. However modern sources tend to regard this as outdated; they are now considered to be more closely related to bacteria, and the term for true &quot;algae&quot; is restricted to eukaryotic organisms. Like true algae, cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and contain photosynthetic pigments, which is why they are usually green or blue.

Cyanobacteria are found almost everywhere; in oceans, lakes and rivers as well as on land. They flourish in Arctic and Antarctic lakes, hotsprings and wastewater treatment plants. They even inhabit the fur of polar bears, to which they impart a greenish tinge. Cyanobacteria produce potent toxins, but they also produce helpful bioactive compounds, including substances with antitumour, antiviral, anticancer, antibiotic and antifungal activity, UV protectants and specific inhibitors of enzymes.

==Harmful algal blooms==

Cyanotoxins are often implicated in what are commonly called &quot;red tides&quot; or &quot;harmful algal blooms&quot;. Lakes and oceans contain many single-celled organisms called phytoplankton. Under certain conditions, particularly when nutrient concentrations are high, these organisms reproduce exponentially. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an algal bloom; these can cover hundreds of square kilometres and can be easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.

While some of these blooms are harmless, others fall into the category of harmful algal blooms, or HABs. HABs can contain toxins or pathogens which result in fish kill and can also be fatal to humans. In marine environments, HABs are mostly caused by dinoflagellates, though species of other algae taxa can also cause HABs (diatoms, flagellates, haptophytes and raphidophytes). Marine dinoflagellate species are often toxic, but freshwater species are not known to be toxic. Neither are diatoms known to be toxic, at least to humans.

In freshwater ecosystems, algal blooms are most commonly caused by high levels of nutrients (eutrophication). The blooms can look like foam, scum or mats or like paint floating on the surface of the water, but they are not always visible. Nor are the blooms always green; they can be blue, and some cyanobacteria species are coloured brownish-red. The water can smell bad when the cyanobacteria in the bloom die.

Strong cyanobacterial blooms reduce visibility to one or two centimetres. Species which are not reliant on sight (such as cyanobacteria themselves) survive, but species which need to see to find food and partners are compromised. During the day blooming cyanobacteria saturate the water with oxygen. At night respiring aquatic organisms can deplete the oxygen to the point where sensitive species, such as certain fish, die. This is more likely to happen near the sea floor or a thermocline. Water acidity also cycles daily during a bloom, with the pH reaching 9 or more during the day and dropping to low values at night, further stressing the ecosystem. In addition, many cyanobacteria species produce potent cyanotoxins which concentrate during a bloom to the point where they become lethal to nearby aquatic organisms and any other animals in direct contact with the bloom, including birds, livestock, domestic animals and sometimes humans.

In 1991 a harmful cyanobacterial bloom affected 1,000 km of the Darling-Barwon River in Australia at an economic cost of $10M AUD.

==Chemical structure==
Cyanotoxins usually target the nervous system (neurotoxins), the liver (hepatotoxins) or the skin (dermatoxins). The chemical structure of cyanotoxins falls into three broad groups: cyclic peptides, alkaloids 
and lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins).
 
Most cyanotoxins have a number of variants (analogues). As of 1999, altogether over 84 cyanotoxins were known and only a small number have been well studied.

==Cyclic peptides==
A peptide is a short polymer of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. They have the same chemical structure as proteins, except they are shorter. In a cyclic peptide, the ends link to form a stable circular chain. In mammals this stability makes them resistant to the process of digestion and they can bioaccumulate in the liver. Of all the cyanotoxins, the cyclic peptides are of most concern to human health. The microcystins and nodularins poison the liver, and exposure to high doses can cause death. Exposure to low doses in drinking water over a long period of time may promote liver and other tumours.

===Microcystins===
As with other cyanotoxins, microcystins were named after the first organism discovered to produce them, &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot;. However it was later found other cyanobacterial genera also produced them. There are about 60 known variants of microcystin, and several of these can be produced during a bloom. The most reported variant is microcystin-LR, possibly because the earliest commercially available chemical standard analysis was for microcystin-&quot;LR&quot;.

Blooms containing microcystin are a problem worldwide in freshwater ecosystems. Microcystins are cyclic peptides and can be very toxic for plants and animals including humans. They bioaccumulate in the liver of fish, in the hepatopancreas of mussels, and in zooplankton. They are hepatotoxic and can cause serious damage to the liver in humans. In this way they are similar to the nodularins (below), and together the microcystins and nodularins account for most of the toxic cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and brackish waters. In 2010, a number of sea otters were poisoned by microcystin. Marine bivalves were the likely source of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning. This was the first confirmed example of a marine mammal dying from ingesting a cyanotoxin.

===Nodularins===
The first nodularin variant to be identified was nodularin-R, produced by the cyanobacterium &quot;Nodularia spumigena&quot;. This cyanobacterium blooms in water bodies throughout the world. In the Baltic Sea, marine blooms of &quot;Nodularia spumigena&quot; are among some of the largest cyanobacterial mass events in the world. (Parts of nine industrialized countries drain into the Baltic Sea, which has little water exchange with the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. It is consequently one of the more polluted bodies of water in the world (nutrient-rich, from the perspective of cyanobacteria).)

Globally, the most common toxins present in cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and brackish waters are the cyclic peptide toxins of the nodularin family. Like the microcystin family (above), nodularins are potent hepatotoxins and can cause serious damage to the liver. They present health risks for wild and domestic animals as well as humans, and in many areas pose major challenges for the provision of safe drinking water.

==Alkaloids==
Alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring chemical compounds which mostly contain basic nitrogen atoms. They are produced by a large variety of organisms, including cyanobacteria, and are part of the group of natural products, also called secondary metabolites. Alkaloids act on diverse metabolic systems in humans and other animals, often with psychotropic or toxic effects. Almost uniformly, they are bitter tasting.

===Anatoxin-&quot;a&quot;===
Investigations into anatoxin-&quot;a&quot;, also known as &quot;Very Fast Death Factor&quot;, began in 1961 following the deaths of cows that drank from a lake containing an algal bloom in Saskatchewan, Canada. The toxin is produced by at least four different genera of cyanobacteria and has been reported in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand.

Toxic effects from anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; progress very rapidly because it acts directly on the nerve cells (neurons) as a neurotoxin. The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; exposure are loss of coordination, twitching, convulsions and rapid death by respiratory paralysis. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Stimulation of these receptors causes a muscular contraction. The anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, and in this way it mimics the natural neurotransmitter normally used by the receptor, acetylcholine. Once it has triggered a contraction, anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by cholinesterase which normally performs this function. As a result, the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.

The toxin was called the Very Fast Death Factor because it induced tremors, paralysis and death within a few minutes when injected into the body cavity of mice. In 1977, the structure of VFDF was determined as a secondary, bicyclic amine alkaloid, and it was renamed anatoxin-&quot;a&quot;. Structurally, it is similar to cocaine. There is continued interest in anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; because of the dangers it presents to recreational and drinking waters, and because it is a particularly useful molecule for investigating acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system. The deadliness of the toxin means that it has a high military potential as a toxin weapon.

===Cylindrospermopsins===
Cylindrospermopsin (abbreviated to CYN or CYL) was first discovered after an outbreak of a mystery disease on Palm Island in Australia. The outbreak was traced back to a bloom of &quot;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&quot; in the local drinking water supply, and the toxin was subsequently identified. Analysis of the toxin led to a proposed chemical structure in 1992, which was revised after synthesis was achieved in 2000. Several variants of cylindrospermopsin, both toxic and non-toxic, have been isolated or synthesised.

Cylindrospermopsin is toxic to liver and kidney tissue and is thought to inhibit protein synthesis and to covalently modify DNA and/or RNA. There is concern about the way cylindrospermopsin bioaccumulates in freshwater organisms. Toxic blooms of genera which produce cylindrospermopsin are most commonly found in tropical, subtropical and arid zone water bodies, and have recently been found in Australia, Europe, Israel, Japan and the USA.

===Saxitoxins===
Saxitoxin (STX) is one of the most potent natural neurotoxins known. The term saxitoxin originates from the species name of the butter clam (&quot;Saxidomus giganteus&quot;) whereby it was first recognized. Saxitoxin is produced by the cyanobacteria &quot;Anabaena&quot; spp., some &quot;Aphanizomenon&quot; spp., &quot;Cylindrospermopsis&quot; sp., &quot;Lyngbya&quot; sp. and &quot;Planktothrix&quot; sp., among others). Puffer fish and some marine dinoflagellates also produce saxitoxin. Saxitoxins bioaccumulate in shellfish and certain finfish. Ingestion of saxitoxin, usually through shellfish contaminated by toxic algal blooms, can result in paralytic shellfish poisoning.

Saxitoxin has been used in molecular biology to establish the function of the sodium channel. It acts on the voltage-gated sodium channels of nerve cells, preventing normal cellular function and leading to paralysis. The blocking of neuronal sodium channels which occurs in paralytic shellfish poisoning produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves its victim calm and conscious through the progression of symptoms. Death often occurs from respiratory failure. Saxitoxin was originally isolated and described by the United States military, who assigned it the chemical weapon designation &quot;TZ&quot;. Saxitoxin is listed in schedule 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. According to the book &quot;Spycraft&quot;, U-2 spyplane pilots were provided with needles containing saxitoxin to be used for suicide in the event escape was impossible.

===Aetokthonotoxin===
Aetokthonotoxin (abbreviated to AETX) was discovered in 2021 as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing vacuolar myelinopathy (VM). As the biosynthesis of aetokthonotoxin depends on the availability of bromide in freshwater systems and requires an interplay between the toxin-producing cyanobacterium &quot;Aetokthonos hydrillicola&quot; and the host plant it epiphytically grows on (most importantly hydrilla), it took &gt; 25 years to discover aetokthonotoxin as the VM-inducing toxin after the disease has first been diagnosed in bald eagles in 1994. The toxin cascades through the food-chain: Among other animals, it affects fish and waterfowl such as coots or ducks which feed on hydrilla colonized with the cyanobacterium. Aetokthonotoxin is transmitted to raptors, such as the bald eagle, that prey on these affected animals.

Vacuolar myelinopathy is characterized by widespread vacuolization of the myelinated axons (intramyelinic edema) in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs of the intoxication include the severe loss of motor functions and sight. Affected birds fly into objects, lack coordination in swimming, flying and walking, develop tremors of the head and lose their responsiveness. As the toxin has been shown to bioaccumulate, there is concern that it might also be a threat to human health. However, toxicity to mammals has yet to be confirmed experimentally.

==Lipopolysaccharides==
Lipopolysaccharides are present in all cyanobacteria. Though not as potent as other cyanotoxins, some researchers have claimed that all lipopolysaccharides in cyanobacteria can irritate the skin, while other researchers doubt the toxic effects are that generalized.

==Amino acids==

===BMAA===
The non-proteinogenic amino acid beta-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is ubiquitously produced by cyanobacteria in marine, freshwater, brackish, and terrestrial environments. The exact mechanisms of BMAA toxicity on neuron cells is being investigated. Research suggests both acute and chronic mechanisms of toxicity. BMAA is being investigated as a potential environmental risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Bark River is a river on the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The river flows into Green Bay on Lake Michigan in Ford River Township about southwest of Escanaba at .

The Bark River rises from the outflow of Second Lake (which is fed by Pine Creek and the outflow of First Lake) on the boundary between Delta County and Menominee County at . The North Branch Bark River rises in a marshy area just east of Schaffer, Michigan in Bark River Township and joins the main course at .

The Bark River was named by some of the first railroad engineers in the area who saw a great quantity of bark floating on the water.

<text>Vishishtadvaita (IAST &quot;&quot;; ) is a school of Hindu philosophy belonging to the Vedanta tradition. Vedanta refers to the profound interpretation of the Vedas based on Prasthanatrayi. Vishishta Advaita, meaning &quot;non-duality with distinctions&quot;, is a non-dualistic philosophy that recognizes Brahman as the supreme reality while also acknowledging its multiplicity. This philosophy can be characterized as a form of qualified monism, attributive monism, or qualified non-dualism. It upholds the belief that all diversity ultimately stems from a fundamental underlying unity.

Ramanuja, the 11–12th century philosopher and the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, contends that the Prasthanatrayi (&quot;The three sources&quot;), namely the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency. Vedanta Desika, another major scholar who significantly helped expand the philosophy of Vishitadvaita, defines &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; using the statement, &quot;Aseṣa Chit-Achit Prakāram Brahmaikameva Tatvam&quot; : Brahman, as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the Ultimate reality.

==History==
The Vishishtadvaita philosophy is believed to have a long history, with its earliest works no longer available. The names of these earliest philosophers are only mentioned in Ramanuja&#x27;s Vedarthasamgraha. Bodhayana, Dramida, Tanka, Guhadeva, Kapardi, and Bharuci are some of the well-known philosophers in the line of those who are thought to have developed the Vishishtadvaita system.

Bodhayana is considered to have written an extensive &quot;vritti&quot; (commentary) on the Purva and Uttara Mimamsas. Tanka is attributed with having written commentaries on Chandogya Upanishad and Brahma Sutras. Nathamuni of the ninth century AD, the foremost Acharya of the Vaishnavas, collected the Tamil prabandhas, classified them, made the redaction, set the hymns to music and spread them everywhere. He is said to have received the divine hymns straight from Nammalvar, the foremost of the twelve Alvars, by yogic insight in the temple at Alwar Thirunagari, which is located near Tirunelveli in South India. Yamunacharya renounced kingship and spent his last days in the service of the deity at Srirangam and in laying the fundamentals of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy by writing four basic works on the subject.

Ramanuja is the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy. Ramanuja continues along the line of thought of his predecessors while expounding the knowledge expressed in the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. Vedanta Desika and Pillai Lokacharya, disciples in the tradition of Ramanuja, had minor disagreements not on the philosophy, but on some aspects of the theology, giving rise to the Vadakalai and Tenkalai schools of thought.

Bhagwan Swaminarayan, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, propagated a related philosophy and partly based the sampradaya on these ideals. The BAPS, a Swaminarayan sect, published its view on his philosophy through the Prasthanatrayi in the Swaminarayan Bhashyam. Swaminarayan expounded the existence of five eternal entities, distinguishing Brahman from Parabrahman eternally. He also emphasized Jivanmukti and the importance of becoming brahmarupa. This interpretation of Swaminarayan&#x27;s philosophy by BAPS sadhus is known as Akshar-Purushottam Darshan.

== Key principles ==
There are three key principles of Vishishtadvaita:
* &quot;Tattva&quot;: The knowledge of the three real entities, namely &quot;jiva&quot; (living souls, the sentient), &quot;ajiva&quot; (the nonsentient) and Ishvara (&quot;Vishnu-Narayana&quot; or &quot;Parabrahman&quot;, Supreme-self and the cause of all manifestations and in-dwelling giver of grace based on Karma).
* &quot;Hita&quot;: The means of realization, as through &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion) and &quot;prapatti&quot; (self-surrender)
* &quot;Purushartha&quot;: The goal to be attained, as &quot;moksha&quot; or liberation from bondage.
&quot;Viśiṣṭa&quot; means most exclusive (not equal / different from rest).

==Epistemology==

=== Pramanas ===
&quot;Pramana&quot; (&quot;sources of knowledge&quot;, Sanskrit) refers to factual knowledge obtained through reasoning of any object. &quot;Pramana&quot; forms one part of a &quot;triputi&quot; (trio):
# &quot;Pramatir&quot;, the &quot;subject&quot;; the &quot;knower&quot; of knowledge
# &quot;Pramana&quot;, the &quot;cause&quot; or the &quot;means&quot; of knowledge
# &quot;Prameya&quot;, the &quot;object&quot; of knowledge

In Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, only the following three &quot;pramanas&quot; are accepted as valid means of knowledge:
* &quot;Pratyaksa&quot; — knowledge gained by means of perception. Perception in this context generally refers to sensory perception. In modern-day usage, this will also include knowledge obtained by means of observation through scientific instruments, since they are considered an extension of perception.
* &quot;Anumana&quot; — knowledge gained by means of inference. Inference refers to deductive reasoning and analysis.
* &quot;Shabda&quot; — knowledge gained by means of shruti. Shruti refers to knowledge gained from scriptures—primarily the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.

====Rules of epistemology====
There are three rules of hierarchy when there is apparent conflict between the three modes of acquiring knowledge:
* &quot;Shabda&quot; or &quot;Shruti&quot;, Pramana occupies the highest position in matters which cannot be settled or resolved by &quot;pratyaksa&quot; (perception) or by &quot;anumana&quot; (inference).
* &quot;Anumana&quot; occupies the next position. When an issue cannot be settled through sensory perception alone, it is settled based on inference, that is, whichever is the more logical argument.
* When &quot;pratyaksa&quot; yields a definitive position on a particular issue, such a perception cannot be ignored by interpreting &quot;Shabda&quot; in a way which violates that perception.

==Metaphysics==

===Ontology===

The ontology in Vishishtadvaita consists of explaining the relationship between Ishvara (&quot;Parabrahman&quot;), the sentient beings (&quot;chit-Brahman&quot;) and the insentient Universe (&quot;achit-Brahman&quot;). In the broadest sense, Ishvara is the Universal Soul of the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings. The three ontological entities are described below:

====Ishvara====

Ishvara (denoted by Vishnu (Narayana)) is the Supreme Cosmic Spirit who maintains complete control over the Universe and all the sentient beings, which together also form the pan-organistic body of Ishvara. The triad of Ishvara along with the universe and the sentient beings is Brahman, which signifies the completeness of existence. Ishvara is Parabrahman endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities (Kalyana Gunas). Ishvara is perfect, omniscient, omnipresent, incorporeal, independent, the creator of the universe, its active ruler and also its eventual destroyer. He is causeless, eternal and unchangeable—and is yet the material and the efficient cause of the universe and sentient beings. He is both immanent (like whiteness in milk) and transcendent (like a watch-maker independent of a watch). He is the subject of worship. He is the basis of morality and giver of the fruits of one&#x27;s Karma. He rules the world with His Maya—His divine power.

=====Antaryamin=====

The inner controller (&quot;antar-yāmin&quot;) is the thread connecting everything, governing this world, the next, and all beings from within (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.7.3-23).

&quot;He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does not know, whose body water is and who controls water from within—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.&quot;

&quot;He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun from within—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal&quot; — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.7.4–14
===== Brahman =====
There is a subtle difference between Ishvara and Brahman. Ishvara is the substantive part of Brahman, while jivas and jagat are its modes (also secondary attributes), and kalyana-gunas (auspicious attributes) are the primary attributes. The secondary attributes become manifested in the effect state when the world is differentiated by name and form. The kalyana-gunas are eternally manifest.

&quot;Brahman is the description of Ishvara when comprehended in fullness—i.e., a simultaneous vision of Ishvara with all his modes and attributes. &quot;

The relationship between Brahman and Jivas, Jagat is expressed by Rāmānujā in numerous ways. He calls this relationship as one of:
* sharira/shariri (&quot;body/soul&quot;);
* dravya/guna (&quot;substance/attribute&quot;);
* aṃsi/aṃsa (&quot;whole/part&quot;);
* visayi/visaya (&quot;subject/object&quot;);
* angi/angā (&quot;organism/organs&quot;);

These relationships can be experienced holding Brahman as the father, son, mother, sister, wife, husband, friend, lover and lord. Hence, Brahman is a personal being.

Cit and acit are completely dependent on Brahman.
* What does Nirguna Brahman mean?

Ramanuja argues vehemently against understanding Brahman as one without attributes. Brahman is Nirguna in the sense that impure qualities do not touch it. He provides three valid reasons for staking such a claim:

Shruti/Shabda Pramana: All shrutis and shabdas denoting Brahman always list either attributes inherent to Brahman or not inherent to Brahman. The shrutis only seek to deny Brahman from possessing impure and defective qualities which affect the world of beings. There is evidence in the shrutis to this regard. The shrutis proclaim Brahman to be beyond the tri-gunas which are observed. However, Brahman possesses an infinite number of transcendental attributes, the evidence of which is given in vakhyas like &quot;satyam jnanam anantam Brahma&quot; (Taittiriya Upanishad).

Pratyaksha Pramana: Ramanuja states that &quot;a contentless cognition is impossible&quot;. And all cognition must necessarily involve knowing Brahman through the attributes of Brahman.

Anumana Pramana: Ramanuja states that &quot;Nirgunatva&quot; itself becomes an attribute of Brahman on account of the uniqueness of no other entity being Nirguna.
Ramanuja had simplified relationship between bramha and soul. According to him though soul is integral part of bramha it has independent existence.

====Chit====

Chit includes all beings with sentience, consciousness, and individual self-awareness. It is similar to the Purusha of Samkhya system. &quot;Jivas&quot; possess both substantive consciousness (&quot;dharmi-jnana&quot;) and attributive &quot;consciousness&quot; (&quot;dharma-bhuta-jnana&quot;).

There are three types of &quot;jivas&quot;:
# &quot;Nitya:&quot; eternally free &quot;jivas&quot; who were never in samsara
# &quot;Mukta&quot;: &quot;jivas&quot; previously in samsara, but now free
# &quot;Baddha:&quot; &quot;jivas&quot; still in samsara (due to karma and ignorance)

====Achit====
Achit is the world of insentient entities as denoted by matter or more specifically the non-conscious Universe. It is similar to the Prakriti of Samkhya system.

===Theory of Existence===
The three ontological entities i.e. Ishvara, Chit and Achit are fundamentally real. It upholds the doctrine of &quot;Satkaryavada&quot; as against &quot;Asatkaryavada&quot;.

Briefly,
* Satkaryavada is pre-existence of the effect in the cause. It maintains that karya (effect) is sat or real. It is present in the karana (cause) in a potential form, even before its manifestation.
* Asatkaryavada is non-existence of the effect in the cause. It maintains that karya (effect) is asat or unreal until it comes into being. Every effect, then, is a new beginning and is not born out of cause.

More specifically, the effect is a modification of what exists in the cause and does not involve new entities coming into existence. This is called as &quot;parinamavada&quot; or evolution of effect from the cause. This doctrine is common to the Samkhya system and Vishishtadvaita system. The Samkhya system adheres to Prakriti-Parinama vada whereas Vishishtadvaita is a modified form of Brahma-Parinama vada.

The (&quot;cause&quot;) and (&quot;effect&quot;) in Vishishtadvaita is different from other systems of Indian philosophy. Brahman is both the (&quot;cause&quot;) and the (&quot;effect&quot;). Brahman as the cause does not become the Universe as the effect.

Brahman is assigned two (&quot;ways of being the cause&quot;):

# — &quot;Being the Efficient/ Instrumental cause&quot;. For example, a goldsmith is assigned as he acts as the maker of jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery&#x27;s &quot;Instrumental cause&quot;.
# — &quot;Being the material cause&quot;. For example, the gold is assigned as it acts as the material of the jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery&#x27;s &quot;material cause&quot;.

According to Vishishtadvaita, the Universe and Sentients always exist. However, they begin from a subtle state and undergo transformation. The subtle state is called a causal state, while the transformed state is called the effect state. The causal state is when Brahman is internally not distinguishable by name and form.

It can be said that Vishishtadvaita follows Brahma-Prakara-Parinama Vada. That is to say, it is the modes (Jivas and Jagat) of Brahman which is under evolution. The cause and effect only refer to the pan-organistic body transformation. Brahman as the Universal Self is unchanging and eternal.

Brahman having the subtle (sūkṣma) chit and achit entities as his &quot;Śarīra/Prakāra(body/mode)&quot; before manifestation is the same Brahman having the expanded (sthūla) chit and achit entities as &quot;Śarīra/Prakāra(body/mode)&quot; after manifestation.

The essential feature is that the underlying entity is the same, the changes are in the description of that entity.

For e.g. &quot;Jack was a baby. Jack was a small kid. Jack was a middle-aged person. Jack was an old man. Jack is dead&quot;

The body of a single personality named Jack is described as continuously changing. Jack does not become &quot;James&quot; because of the change.

==Interpretation of Mahāvākyas==
1. sarvam khalv idam brahma from Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1

Translated literally, this means &quot;All this is Brahman&quot;. The ontology of Vishishtadvaita system consists of:

a. Ishvara is &quot;Para-Brahman&quot; with infinite superlative qualities, whose substantive nature imparts the existence to the modes

b. Jivas are &quot;chit-Brahman&quot; or sentient beings (which possess consciousness). They are the modes of Brahman which show consciousness.

c. Jagat is &quot;achit-Brahman&quot; or matter/Universe (which are non-conscious). They are the mode of Brahman which are not conscious.

Brahman is the composite whole of the triad consisting of Ishvara along with his modes i.e. Jivas and Jagat.

2. ayam ātmā brahma from Mandukya Upanishad 1.2

Translated literally, this means the &quot;Self is Brahman&quot;.
From the earlier statement, it follows that on account of everything being Brahman, the self is not different from Brahman.

3. Tat tvam asi from Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7

Translated literally, it means &quot;Thou art that&quot;

&quot;that&quot; here refers to &quot;Brahman&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; refers to &quot;jiva&quot;

Rāmānujā chooses to take the position of universal identity. He interprets this passage to mean the subsistence of all attributes in a common underlying substratum. This is referred to as &quot;sāmānādhikaraṇya&quot;. Thus Rāmānujā says the purport of the passage is to show the unity of all beings in a common base. Ishvara (&quot;Parabrahman&quot;) who is the Cosmic Spirit for the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings, is also simultaneously the innermost self (Ātman) for each individual sentient being (Jīva). All the bodies, the Cosmic and the individual, are held in an adjectival relationship (aprithak-siddhi) in the one Isvara.

Tat tvam asi declares that oneness of Ishvara.

When multiple entities point to a single object, the relationship is established as one of substance and its attributes.

For e.g. in a statement:

&quot;Jack is a tall and intelligent boy&quot;

The descriptors &quot;tall-ness&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;boy-ness&quot; all refer to a common underlying &quot;Jack&quot;

Similarly, when the Upanishads declare Brahman is the Universe, Purusha, Self, Prana, Vayu, and so on, the entities are attributes or modes of Brahman.

If the statement tat tvam asi is taken to mean as only &quot;the self is Brahman&quot;, then sarvam khalv idam brahma will not make sense.

==Purpose of human existence==
The purpose or goal of human existence is called purushartha. According to the Vedas, there are four goals namely artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), dharma (righteousness) and moksha (permanent freedom from worldly bondage). According to this philosophy, the first three goals are not an end by themselves but need to be pursued with the ideal of attaining moksha.

===Moksha (Liberation)===
Moksha means liberation or release from samsara, the cycle of rebirth. In Vishishtadvaita, &quot;baddha&quot; (bounded) &quot;jiva&quot; is only self-aware and is in a state of ignorance of &quot;sharira-shariri&quot; relationship. Karma loaded with countless births and deaths in &quot;samsara&quot; keeps the &quot;jiva&quot; from &quot;dharma-bhuta-jnana&quot; (attributive consciousness) of God. With creation process of &quot;Isvara&quot;, evolving through different bodies, &quot;jiva&quot; attains human body in which it puts effort to gain true nature of self and true knowledge of God through &quot;Bhakti&quot; and attains liberated state with grace of God. Liberation simply means gaining true knowledge of God and serving God in &quot;Vaikuntha&quot; (God&#x27;s abode). In liberation, &quot;jiva&quot; keeps its individuality and has infinte knowledge and bliss like &quot;Brahman&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t become one with &quot;Brahman&quot;. Unlike advaita, liberation is only after death (&quot;videhamukti&quot;) and there is no concept of &quot;jivanmukti&quot;.

The Vadakalai school accepts the importance of God&#x27;s grace in gaining liberation alongside individual effort, similar to how a baby monkey must hold onto its mother. The Tenkalai school sees God&#x27;s grace as the only requirement for liberation, similar to how a cat will carry a kitten without any effort from the kitten. 

===Bhakti as the means of attaining moksha===
Bhakti is the sole means of liberation in Vishishtadvaita. Through Bhakti (devotion), a Jiva ascends to Vaikuntha, where it continues to delight in His service in a body which is &quot;sat-cit-ananda&quot;. Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are sub processes of Bhakti, total surrender, as the devotee acquires the knowledge that the deity is the inner self. A devotee realizes his own state as dependent on, and supported by, and being led by the deity, who is the Master. One is to lead a life as an instrument of the deity, offering all his thought, word, and deed to the feet of the deity. One is to see the deity in everything and everything in Him. This is the unity in diversity achieved through devotion.
However, Ramanuja accepts Sharanagati, total surrender at the Lord&#x27;s lotus feet alone as the sole means to moksha. Wherein, moksha is defined as liberation from samsara and going to Vaikuntha to serve Narayana (Balaji) in a spiritual body. This is a distinguishing feature of this school of philosophy, as both Adi Shankara&#x27;s advaita and Anandatirtha&#x27;s dvaita accept bhakti for two different concepts of moksha. Ramanuja has supported this opinion with various citations directly from the vedas, and various incidents highlighting sharangathi as means to attain personal stay in the realm of Vaikuntha. Observing total surrender at the Lord&#x27;s feet guarantees moksha at the end of this birth, and in the time between sharanagathi and death, the surrendered soul must spend his time performing the nice forms of devotion.

== Tenkalai and Vadakalai schools of thought ==
The Sri Vaishnava tradition has two major sub-traditions called Vadakalai (northern) and Tenkalai (southern) in Tamil. The Vadakalai sect of Sri Vaishnavism associate themselves with Vedanta Desikan and Ramanuja. Vedanta Desika is one of the foremost learned scholars and philosophers of medieval India, who has written more than a hundred works in Sanskrit and Tamil, Prakrit and Manipravala. He is said to have been born as an incarnation of the divine bell of Venkateshwara of Tirupati and also of Ramanuja in the month of Purattasi under the star Thiruvonam (Sravana), in the year 1268 CE. All of his works are characterized by his versatility, irrefutable reasoning, logic, examination, deep spiritual insight, ethical fervour and excellent expressions of devotional emotion in delightful style. His &quot;Paduka-sahasram&quot; and &quot;Rahasyatrayasaram&quot; are some classic examples. He was a great teacher, logician, expositor, debater, poet, philosopher, thinker and defender of the faith of Vaishnavism. &quot;Kavitaarkika Simham&quot; (lion among poets and debaters), &quot;Sarvatantra Svatantrar&quot; (all-knowing and all-powerful), &quot;Vedantacharya&quot; (the master and preceptor of the Vedanta) are some of the titles attributed to him.

Pillai Lokacharya literally meaning &quot;Teacher for the whole world&quot; is one of the leading lights on the Sri Vaishnava Vedanta philosophy. His work Sri Vachana Bhusanam is a classic and provides the essence of Upanishads. The Tenkalai sect of Sri Vaishnavism looks up to him apart from Swami Ramanuja and Swami Manavala Mamuni. He was a senior contemporary of Vedanta Desika. He is said to have been born as an &quot;amsa&quot; (&quot;essence&quot;) of Kanchi Devaraja (Varadaraja) Perumal to document and immortalize Ramanuja&#x27;s message in the month of Aippaci under the star Thiruvonam (Sravana), in the year 1205 CE. He is said to have lived for 106 years, during which time, he also helped to safeguard the idol of Ranganatha at Srirangam from Muslim invaders. Pillai Lokacharya confirmed the basics of the Sri Vaishnava system in his 18 monumental works popularly known as &quot;Ashtadasa Rahasyangal&quot; (&quot;the eighteen secrets&quot;) also called the Rahasya granthas (&quot;doctrines that explain the inner meanings&quot;) out of which Sri Vachana Bhushanam and Mumukshuppadi are the most famous. Manavala Mamuni expanded on and popularized Lokacharya&#x27;s teachings arguments in Tamil.

==Traditions following Vishishtadvaita==
* Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya of southern India
* Sri Ramanandi Sect of Northern India, it has the largest monastic order in whole India
* Dāmodariya Vaiśņava sampradaya of Assam
*Swaminarayan sampradaya of Gujarat

=== Visishtadvaita and Sri Vaishnavism ===

The Absolute Supreme Reality referred to as Brahman, is a Transcendent Personality. He is Narayana, also known as deity Vishnu.

&quot;A man who has discrimination for his charioteer and holds the reins of the mind firmly, reaches the end of the road; and that is the supreme position of Vishnu.&quot; - 1.3.9 Katha Upanishad

&quot;Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects is the mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the intellect, the Great Atman; beyond the Great Atman, the Unmanifest; beyond the Unmanifest, the Purusha. Beyond the Purusha there is nothing: this is the end, the Supreme Goal.&quot;- 1.3.10,11 Katha Upanishad

In terms of theology, Ramanuja puts forth the view that both the Supreme Goddess Lakshmi and Supreme God Narayana together constitute Brahman - the Absolute. Lakshmi is the female personification of Brahman and Narayana is the male personification of Brahman, but they are both inseparable, co-eternal, co-absolute and are always substantially one. Thus, in reference to these dual aspects of Brahman, the Supreme is referred as Sriman Narayana in the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya.

The most striking difference between Sri Vaishnavas and other Vaishnava groups lies in their interpretation of Vedas. While other Vaishnava groups interpret Vedic deities like Indra, Savitar, Bhaga, Rudra, etc. to be same as their Puranic counterparts, Sri Vaishnavas consider these to be different names/roles/forms of Narayana, claiming that the entire Veda is dedicated for Vishnu worship alone. Sri Vaishnavas have remodelled Pancharatra homas like Sudarshana homa, etc. to include Vedic Suktas like Rudram in them, thus giving them a Vedic outlook.

<text>Vulca was an Etruscan artist from the town of Veii. The only Etruscan artist mentioned by ancient writers, he worked for the last of the Roman kings, Tarquinius Superbus (who died in 495 BC). He is responsible for creating a terracotta statue of Jupiter that was inside the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, and possibly the Apollo of Veii. His statue of Jupiter, which being made of terracotta had a red face, was so famous that victorious Roman generals would paint their faces red during their triumphal marches through Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote that his works were &quot;the finest images of deities of that era...more admired than gold.&quot;

<text>UGC is a cinema operator in France and Belgium, operating 57 cinemas as of 2022. It is also a major film production and distribution company.

==France &amp; Belgium==
UGC was originally an exclusively French operator, privatized in 1971, who merged with several regional cinema companies running 22 cinemas. The name originally stood for &quot;Union Générale Cinématographique&quot;, but today only the initials are used. The company is focused on the business side of the film business and French-dubbed versions, showing little interest in the screening of artistic cinema, on the contrary to Pathé and Gaumont cinemas, except in some UGC Paris theatres where the programming is very diversified and includes both subtitled and dubbed versions. Out of Paris, in some cities like Nantes, Bordeaux or Lyon, a part of this diversified programming does exist, but mostly UGC cinemas are like Pathé and Gaumont cinemas. Its competitors include Pathé Cinémas, Cinéville, CGR and Kinepolis Group.

In 2016, Kinepolis Group had sold the four Belgian Utopolis cinemas it had happened to acquire when it had taken over Utopia Group to UGC. UGC had already owned three Belgian cinemas (one in Antwerp and two in Brussels) and now more than doubled that number, adding one cinema each in Aarschot, Lommel, Mechelen and Turnhout.

As of January 2022, UGC had:

*France: 50 cinemas, 512 screens;
*Belgium: 7 cinemas, 74 screens.

==Former operations==
===Italy and Spain===
In Italy there were 4 UGC multiplexes : Porta di Roma and Parco Leonardo in Rome and Fiumicino, 45 ° N in Moncalieri in the urban area of Turin (located exactly on the 45th parallel north, from which it takes its name) and Romagna in Savignano sul Rubicone, close to Cesena and Rimini. The 4 multiplexes consisted of 66 screens and 15,000 total seats.

In Spain UGC had 5 multiplexes: three in Madrid and one each in Valladolid and Cadiz.

Odeon and UCI Cinema Group purchased in 2011 the UGC Cinemas in Italy which are integrated in UCI Cinemas Italy and in Spain which were integrated in the local chain of cinemas Cinesa.

===UK and Ireland===
UGC was formerly also a leading UK cinema owner following the purchase of Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Cinema Group, which it purchased in October 1999. In December 2004, the business was sold to Blackstone Group and joined with Cine-UK to trade as Cineworld. UGC&#x27;s chain in the UK and Ireland consisted of:

* UK: 41 cinemas, 391 screens;
* Ireland: 1 cinema, 17 screens.

In July 2005, Cineworld began to phase out the UGC brand, replacing it with its own Cineworld logo. This rebranding was completed in September 2005. Cineworld has retained certain aspects of the UGC offer, including the Unlimited season ticket, originally introduced by Virgin, and the free magazine of the same name.

<text>John James Deutsch (26 February 1911 – March 18, 1976) was a Canadian economist who served as the first chairman of the Economic Council of Canada, and as principal (1968–74) of Queen&#x27;s University.

Born in Quinton, Saskatchewan, and educated at Queen&#x27;s, he worked in journalism and in government, as well as at the university. In 1947 Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King asked Deutsch to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States, that would have produced a sweeping liberalization of Canada-U.S. trade, had it not in the end been repudiated by King&#x27;s government. He subsequently became an economics professor at Queen&#x27;s, and then the university&#x27;s vice-principal (administration), before being selected as principal.

In 1966, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.

During his term as Principal, Queen&#x27;s underwent a substantial expansion of its infrastructure, to meet the increased demands of the baby boomer generation, which was growing towards university enrollment age. A new stadium, a new athletics complex, a new student union building, new residence accommodation, and several new academic buildings were all opened under Deutsch&#x27;s leadership.

Deutsch, who died in 1976, is remembered at Queen&#x27;s through the John Deutsch University Centre (JDUC), the student union building, and through the John Deutsch Institute for the Study of Economic Policy, in the university&#x27;s department of economics. A large banner, containing hoods from his 23 honorary degrees, is prominently displayed in the JDUC.

In 1969 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="1064736" wikidata="Q1049267" url="?curid=1064736" title="Calonectris">
<text>Calonectris is a genus of seabirds. The genus name comes from Ancient Greek &quot;kalos&quot;, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;nectris&quot;, &quot;swimmer&quot;.

The genus comprises four large shearwaters. There are two other shearwater genera, &quot;Puffinus&quot;, which comprises 21 small to medium-sized shearwaters, and &quot;Ardenna&quot; with 7 larger species.

The species in this group are long-winged birds, dark brown or grey-brown above, and mainly white below. They are pelagic outside the breeding season. They are most common in temperate and cold waters. Like most other tubenose birds, they use a shearing flight technique to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight, but fly with a more relaxed, fluid, flexible wing action than the other shearwaters in &quot;Puffinus&quot; and &quot;Ardenna&quot;.

&quot;Calonectris&quot; shearwaters are long-distance migrants. The streaked shearwater disperses from its east Asian breeding islands throughout the western Pacific and into the eastern Indian Ocean. They come to islands and coastal cliffs only to breed. They are nocturnal at the colonial breeding sites, preferring moonless nights to minimise predation. They nest in burrows and often give eerie contact calls on their night time visits. They lay a single white egg. They feed on fish, squid and similar oceanic food. They will follow fishing boats to take scraps.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Calonectris&quot; was introduced in 1915 by the ornithologists Gregory Mathews and Tom Iredale with the streaked shearwater as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kalos&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot; or &quot;noble&quot; with the genus name &quot;Nectris&quot; that was used for shearwaters by the German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. The name &quot;Nectris&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;nēktris&quot; meaning &quot;swimmer&quot;.

Scopoli&#x27;s shearwater and Cory&#x27;s shearwater were previously considered as conspecific and formed the Cory&#x27;s shearwater complex (&quot;Calonectris diomedea&quot;). Based on the lack of hybridization and differences in mitochondrial DNA, morphology and vocalisation, the complex was split into two separate species. The English name &quot;Cory&#x27;s shearwater&quot; was transferred to &quot;Calonectris borealis&quot; while what was previously the nominate subspecies became Scopoli&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Calonectris diomedea&quot;).

===Species===
The genus contains four species.
Extinct species, &quot;Calonectris krantzi&quot; from the Early Pliocene and &quot;Calonectris wingatei&quot; from the Middle Pleistocene, have also been described from fossils. &quot;Calonectris kurodai&quot;, another fossil from the Middle Miocene Calvert Formation of Chesapeake Bay is named after the Japanese ornithologist Nagahisa Kuroda.

<doc id="1064742" wikidata="Q1163759" url="?curid=1064742" title="Ganges Delta">
<text>The Ganges Delta (also known the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the Sundarbans Delta or the Bengal Delta) is a river delta predominantly covering the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, consisting of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the world&#x27;s largest river delta and it empties into the Bay of Bengal with the combined waters of several river systems, mainly those of the Brahmaputra River and the Ganges River. It is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname the &quot;Green Delta&quot;. The delta stretches from the Hooghly River in the west as far as the Meghna River in the east.

==Geography==
The Ganges Delta has the shape of a triangle and is considered to be &quot;arcuate&quot; (arc-shaped). It covers more than and lies mostly in Bangladesh and India, with rivers from Bhutan, Tibet, and Nepal draining into it from the north. 67% of the delta is inside Bangladesh and only 33% belongs to West Bengal. Most of the delta is composed of alluvial soils made up by small sediment particles that finally settle down as river currents slowdown in the estuary. Rivers carry these fine particles with them, even from their sources at glaciers as fluvio-glacial. Red and red-yellow laterite soils are found as one heads farther east. The soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients, which is good for agriculture.

It is composed of a labyrinth of channels, swamps, lakes, and flood plain sediments (chars). The Gorai-Madhumati River, one of the distributaries of the Ganges, divides the Ganges Delta into two parts: the geologically young, active, eastern delta, and the older, less active, western delta.

==Population==
Around 280 million (180 million Bangladesh and 100 million West Bengal, India) people live on the delta, despite risks from floods caused by monsoons, heavy run-off from the melting snows of the Himalayas, and North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones. A large part of the nation of Bangladesh lies in the Ganges Delta; many of the country&#x27;s people depend on the delta for survival.

It is believed that upwards of 300 million people are supported by the Ganges Delta; approximately 400 million people live in the Ganges River Basin, making it the most populous river basin in the world. Most of the Ganges Delta has a population density greater than 200/km2 (520 people per square mile), making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world.

==Wildlife==
Three terrestrial ecoregions cover the delta. The Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests ecoregion covers most of the delta region, although the forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture and only small enclaves remain. Thick stands of tall grass, known as canebrakes, grow in wetter areas. The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests ecoregion lies closer to the Bay of Bengal; this ecoregion is flooded with slightly brackish water during the dry season, and fresh water during the monsoon season. These forests, too, have been almost completely converted to intensive agriculture, with only of the protected. Where the delta meets the Bay of Bengal, Sundarbans mangroves form the world&#x27;s largest mangrove ecoregion, covering an area of in a chain of 54 islands. They derive their name from the predominant mangrove species, &quot;Heritiera fomes&quot;, which are known locally as &quot;sundri&quot; or &quot;sundari&quot;.

Animals in the delta include the Indian python (&quot;Python molurus&quot;), clouded leopard (&quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot;), Indian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus indicus&quot;) and crocodiles, which live in the Sundarbans. Approximately 1,020 endangered Bengal tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot;) are believed to inhabit the Sundarbans. The Ganges–Brahmaputra basin has tropical deciduous forests that yield valuable timber: sal, teak, and peepal trees are found in these areas.

It is estimated that 30,000 chital (&quot;Axis axis&quot;) are in the Sundarbans part of the delta. Birds found in the delta include kingfishers, eagles, woodpeckers, the shalik (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;), the swamp francolin (&quot;Francolinus gularis&quot;), and the doel (&quot;Copsychus saularis&quot;). Two species of dolphin can be found in the delta: the Irrawaddy dolphin (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;) and the Ganges river dolphin (&quot;Platanista gangetica gangetica&quot;). The Irrawaddy dolphin is an oceanic dolphin which enters the delta from the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges river dolphin is a true river dolphin, but is extremely rare and considered endangered.

Trees found in the delta include sundari, garjan (&quot;Rhizophora&quot; spp.), bamboo, mangrove palm (&quot;Nypa fruticans&quot;), and mangrove date palm (&quot;Phoenix paludosa&quot;).

==Geology==
The Ganges Delta lies at the junction of three tectonic plates: the Indian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Burma Plate. The edge of the Eocene paleoshelf runs approximately from Kolkata to the edge of the Shillong Plateau. The edge of the paleoshelf marks the transition from the thick continental crust in the northwest to the thin continental or oceanic crust in the southeast. The enormous sediment supply from the Himalayan collision has extended the delta about seaward since the Eocene. The sediment thickness southeast of the edge of the paleoshelf beneath the Ganges Delta can exceed .

==Economy==

Approximately two-thirds of the Bangladesh people work in agriculture and grow crops on the fertile floodplains of the delta. The major crops that are grown in the Ganges Delta are jute, tea, and rice. Fishing is also an important activity in the delta region, with fish being a major source of food for many of the people in the area.

In the last decades of the 20th century, scientists helped the poor people of the delta to improve fish farming methods. By turning unused ponds into viable fish farms and improving methods of raising fish in existing ponds, many people can now earn a living raising and selling fish. Using new systems, fish production in existing ponds has increased 800%. Shrimp are farmed in containers or cages that are submerged in open water. Most are exported.


As there is a maze of many river branches, the area is difficult to pass. Most islands are only connected with the mainland by simple wooden ferryboats. Bridges are rare. Some islands are not yet connected to the electric grid, so island residents tend to use solar cells for a bit of electric supply.

===Arsenic pollution===

Arsenic is a naturally occurring substance in the Ganga Delta that has detrimental effects on health and may enter the food chain, especially in key crops such as rice.

==Climate==
The Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone, and receives between of rainfall each year in the western part, and in the eastern part.. Hot, dry summers and cool, dry winters make the climate suitable for agriculture.

===Cyclones and flooding===
In November 1970, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century hit the Ganges Delta region. The 1970 Bhola cyclone killed 500,000 people (official death toll), with another 100,000 missing. The Guinness Book of World Records estimated the total loss of human life from the Bhola cyclone at 1,000,000.

Another cyclone hit the delta in 1991, killing about 139,000 people. It also left many people homeless.

People have to be careful on the river delta as severe flooding also occurs. In 1998, the Ganges flooded the delta, killing about 1,000 people and leaving more than 30 million people homeless. The Bangladesh government asked for $900 million to help feed the people of the region, as the entire rice crop was lost.

== History ==
The history of the Bengal Delta has been a concern of emerging scholarship by environmental historians.

Indian historian Vinita Damodaran has extensively profiled famine management practices by the East India Company, and related these practices to major ecological changes wrought about by forest and land management practices. Debjani Bhattacharyya has shown how Calcutta was constructed as an urban centre through tracing ecological changes wrought upon by colonial powers involving land, water and humans throughout the mid-18th to the early 20th centuries.

In terms of recent scholarship that focuses more on the eastern part of the Bengal/Ganges Delta, Iftekhar Iqbal argues for the inclusion of the Bengal Delta as an ecological framework within which to study the dynamics of agrarian prosperity or decline, communal conflicts, poverty and famine, especially throughout the colonial period. Iqbal has tried to show how resistance movements such as the Faraizi movement can be studied in relation to colonial ecological management practices.

A strong criticism of environmental history scholarship with regards to the Bengal/Ganges delta is that most of the scholarship is limited to the 18th to the 21st centuries, with a general dearth of ecological history of the region prior to the 18th century.

==Future of the delta==
One of the greatest challenges people living on the Ganges Delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused by climate change. An increase in sea level of could result in six million people losing their homes in Bangladesh.

Important gas reserves have been discovered in the delta, such as in the Titas and Bakhrabad gas fields. Several major oil companies have invested in exploration of the Ganges Delta region.

=== Tidal river management ===
To offset land loss, tidal river management has been implemented in the delta. This method has been implemented in 5 beels and resulted in benefits including decreased waterlogging, creation of agricultural areas, improved navigation and land creation.

<text>Sixfields is an area of Northampton, Northamptonshire, England about west of the town centre along the A4500 St James Road and Weedon Road towards M1 junction 16 about further west. It is close to the Duston, Upton and St James areas of the town. Located next to The River Nene and The Grand Union Canal (Northampton Arm), Sixfields is often called &quot;The Starcity of Northamptonshire&quot; .

==Northamptonshire County Council Division==
Sixfields is also the name of a division of Northamptonshire County Council since the 2013 county council elections when it was held by the Liberal Democrat party. The division covers the Northampton town areas of Briar Hill, Camp Hill, part of West Hunsbury, Hunsbury Hill, Swan Valley, Hunsbury Meadows, Upton and St James. The division includes the Sixfields Stadium used by Northampton Town Football Club (known as &quot;The Cobblers&quot;) as well as the Northampton Saints Rugby Football Club stadium both of which are due to expand in 2013. The Northampton Lift Tower is also located there. The River Nene flows in the valley between the north and south parts of the division. Significant flooding occurred in the St James area in 1998.

==Background==
Part of the area was a landfill site for domestic waste originally. It was redeveloped into a leisure area to accommodate the Sixfields Stadium and an athletics running track. A domestic and trade waste recycling centre run by Northamptonshire County Council occupies part of the site, but will be relocated soon.

==Walter Tull memorial==
Near the Cobblers stadium is a memorial to Walter Tull who played for Northampton Town. Tull became the first black/mixed race combat officer in the British Army during the first world war and was killed in action during 1918. The road past the stadium is named Walter Tull Way often showing signs of subsidence due to the previous use as a waste site.

<text>John Albert Edward William Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough, (18 September 1897 – 11 March 1972), styled Marquess of Blandford until 1934, was a British military officer and peer.

==Early life==

He was born in London on 18 September 1897 as the first of two sons born to Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough and his first wife, the former Consuelo Vanderbilt, an American railroad heiress. His younger brother was Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill who joined the Royal Army Service Corps and fought in the First World War. His parents separated in 1906 and divorced in 1921. Later that year his mother married Lt. Col. Jacques Balsan, a wealthy French balloon, aircraft, and hydroplane pilot, and his father married the French American Gladys Deacon.

His paternal grandparents were George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough and his first wife, Lady Albertha Hamilton (a daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn and Lady Louisa Russell).

His mother was the eldest child, and only daughter, of William Kissam Vanderbilt, a New York railroad millionaire, and the former Alva Erskine Smith. They divorced in 1895; she married his friend Oliver Belmont and he married the widow Anne Harriman. His maternal uncles were William Kissam Vanderbilt II and Harold Stirling Vanderbilt.

Marlborough was educated at Eton before joining the Life Guards.

==Career==
Prior to inheriting the dukedom in 1934, he was a lieutenant-colonel in the Life Guards, and served with distinction in France and Belgium during World War I. After the war, he served as Mayor of Woodstock, where Blenheim is located, from 1937 to 1942. His wife served as the first woman mayor of Woodstock. He also served as High Steward of Oxford in 1937. He enlisted during World War II and was a military liaison officer with the United States forces in Britain.

In 1950, the Duke opened the grounds and many rooms of Blenheim Palace (including the bedroom in which Sir Winston Churchill was born) to the public to help defray the cost of upkeep. Today, he is known as one of the originators of the &quot;stately homes&quot; business.

==Personal life==

On 17 February 1920, he was married to the Hon. Alexandra Mary Cadogan (1900–1961) at a ceremony at St Margaret&#x27;s Church in London attended by King George V and Queen Mary. As a wedding gift, his maternal grandfather gave him a house in London. She was a daughter of Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea, the son and heir of George Henry Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan. Together, they had two sons and three daughters:

* Lady Sarah Consuelo Spencer-Churchill (1921–2000), who married Edwin Fariman Russell (1914–2001) in Westminster in 1943. They divorced in Reno, Nevada in 1966 and she married Guy Burgos Ossa the same year. They divorced in 1967 in Mexico and she married thirdly to Theo Roubanis in Philadelphia in 1967.
* Lady Caroline Spencer-Churchill (1923–1992), who married Major Charles Huguenot Waterhouse (1918–2007) of Middleton Hall, Middleton-by-Youlgreave in Woodstock, Oxfordshire in 1946.
* John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough (1926–2014), who married four times.
* Lady Rosemary Mildred Spencer-Churchill (b. 1929), a lady in waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, she married Charles Robert Muir (d. 1972) at Oxford in 1953. 
* Lord Charles George William Colin Spencer-Churchill (1940–2016), who married Gillian Spreckels Fuller (b. 1946), a great-granddaughter of California industrialist and financier John D. Spreckels, in 1965. They divorced in 1968 and in 1970, he married Elizabeth Jane Wyndham (b. 1948), a great-niece of the interior decorator Nancy Lancaster.

===Second marriage===
Six weeks before his death, on 26 January 1972, the Duke married his second wife, (Frances) Laura (&quot;née&quot; Charteris) Canfield (1915–1990), the widow of the American publishing heir Michael Temple Canfield (whose first wife had been Caroline Lee Bouvier, the sister of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis). Laura Canfield was the second daughter of the Hon. Guy Lawrence Charteris (the second son of Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss and Lady Frances Lucy Tennant). Laura&#x27;s older sister, Ann Geraldine Mary Charteris, was married to the novelist Ian Fleming. Laura herself was previously married to and divorced from Walter Long, 2nd Viscount Long and William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley.

The Duke died at a hospital in London on 11 March 1972, and was succeeded by his son John Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford. He and his first wife are buried in the churchyard of St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter, Lady Sarah (who inherited the bulk of his mother&#x27;s estate upon her death in 1965), he was a grandfather of four: Serena Mary Churchill Russell (b. 1944) (who married Neil Balfour), Consuelo Sarah Russell (b. 1946), Alexandra Brenda Russell (b. 1949), and Jacqueline Russell (b. 1958).

Through his second daughter, Lady Caroline, he was a grandfather of three: Michael Thomas Waterhouse (b. 1949), Elizabeth Ann Waterhouse (b. 1951) (who married Sir Richard Gervase Beckett), and David Charles Waterhouse (b. 1956).

Through his third daughter Lady Rosemary, he was a grandfather of three: Alexander Pepys Muir (b. 1954) (a godson of Princess Margaret), Simon Huntly Muir (b. 1959), and Mary Arabella Muir (b. 1962).

Through his youngest son, Lord Charles, he was a grandfather of three: Rupert John Harold Mark Spencer-Churchill (b. 1971), Dominic Albert Charles Spencer-Churchill (b. 1979), and Alexander David Spencer-Churchill (b. 1983).

<doc id="1064762" wikidata="Q7054623" url="?curid=1064762" title="North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction">
<text>The North Carolina superintendent of public instruction is an elected constitutional officer in the executive branch of the government of the U.S. state of North Carolina. As the head of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, the superintendent oversees the public school systems of the state. They also serve as the secretary of the North Carolina State Board of Education and are a member of the North Carolina Council of State. The incumbent is Mo Green, who became superintendent on January 1, 2025.

The position of state superintendent was originally created in 1852 to run the new Department of Public Instruction. The office was abolished in 1865 but reestablished by the 1868 state constitution as a member of the new State Board of Education. The duties of the superintendent have been altered over time by the North Carolina General Assembly. A new state constitution in 1971 designated the superintendent as the secretary of the Board of Education, but removed the office&#x27;s voting power on the body. The relationship between the superintendent and the board since the 1960s has been characterized by conflict and confusion over their responsibilities.

== History of the office ==
In 1837, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a common school law to combine state and local funds to create a public school system. In 1850, North Carolina Governor Charles Manly appealed to the legislature for the creation of an office with centralized authority over public schools. In 1852, the assembly created the Department of Public Instruction to be led by the superintendent of common schools chosen by legislative appointment. Calvin H. Wiley served in the office from January 1, 1853, until April 25, 1865, when the state declared its offices vacant due to the surrender of the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. Later that year the General Assembly declined to appropriate state funds for public schools and abolished the position of superintendent, effectively terminating the public school system. In 1868 the state ratified a new constitution that provided for a system of public schools to be led by a superintendent of public instruction and a State Board of Education, of which the superintendent was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member and served as the body&#x27;s secretary. Under this framework, the superintendent was tasked with managing the school system and implementing relevant laws, creating an annual report on education in the state, and studying effective educational techniques in other jurisdictions. The constitution also made the superintendent an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Council of State.

The duties of the superintendent and the structure of the Department of Public Instruction have been altered over time by the General Assembly. In 1933 the legislature placed the superintendent on the new State School Commission, which was responsible for educational financing. The commission was disbanded in 1943. That year, the constitution was amended to revise the composition of the State Board of Education, leaving the superintendent a member but adding several seats to be filled by appointment from the governor, imbuing the body with a rivalling political authority over education policy. Conflict between the superintendent and the rest of the board over the scope of their responsibilities became common in the 1960s and 1970s. A 1968 constitutional study commission recommended making the Board of Education responsible for the selection of the superintendent to reduce voters&#x27; burden by shortening the ballot, but this proposal was disregarded by the General Assembly when it rewrote the state constitution in 1971. The new constitution affirmed that the superintendent was the secretary of the State Board of Education and removed the office&#x27;s membership and voting power on the board. In 1987 another effort was made to make the office appointed by the board in an attempt to simplify governance of the state&#x27;s educational system. The North Carolina Senate passed a constitutional amendment to that effect with the support of the governor and lieutenant governor but the bill was quashed in a House of Representatives committee. The following year the legislature empowered the superintendent to organize the structure of the Department of Public Instruction, spend its funds, and enter into relevant contracts in the course of its operations. As secretary to the State Board of Education, the superintendent was made responsible for expenditures related to the board&#x27;s duties and for implementing its policy decisions.

In the 1990s, the Board of Education established the position of deputy superintendent and delegated direct management authority to them. School officials subsequently complained about a lack of clarity in the leadership of the Department of Public Instruction, and the Public School Forum of North Carolina dubbed the system a &quot;four-head monster&quot; under the competing authorities of the superintendent, deputy superintendent, the Board of Education, and the governor. In 1995 the General Assembly passed legislation transferring most of the superintendent&#x27;s powers to the Board of Education. In 1997 the General Assembly again attempted to amend the constitution to remove the popular election of the superintendent, with the effort narrowly failing by two votes in the North Carolina House of Representatives. &quot;Dual-reporting&quot; positions within the Department of Public Instruction, which encompassed employees who were responsible both to the superintendent and the board, came into frequent use during Bob Etheridge&#x27;s tenure as the superintendent.

June Atkinson, who was sworn in in 2005, was the first woman elected to the office. In 2007, the Board of Education resolved that the deputy superintendent was responsible to them and possessed the &quot;power and duty...[t]o manage the Department of Public Instruction,&quot; thus removing the superintendent&#x27;s basic control over the department. This position was later countermanded by state legislation. In 2009, Governor Bev Perdue, with the cooperation of the board, attempted to circumvent Atkinson&#x27;s authority by appointing a chief executive officer to run the Department of Public Instruction, effectively rendering the superintendent a symbolic official. The governor justified her decision by arguing that it was &quot;adding accountability and clear direction to a system that is badly in need of both.&quot; Atkinson sued to assert her leadership over the department, and the Wake County Superior Court decided in her favor, ruling that she was in charge of the chief executive officer.

In 2016, the General Assembly passed legislation transferring some of the board&#x27;s powers to the superintendent. The board sued to block the law, and in 2018 the Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled that the superintendent was responsible &quot;over all matters relating to the direct supervision and administration of the public school system&quot; while also affirming that the board had &quot;ultimate authority under the Constitution to supervise and administer the state&#x27;s public school system&quot; and that the board can determine &quot;the mechanics of the relationship between the Board and the Superintendent, as well as how their respective departments will operate internally.&quot; In wake of the decision, Superintendent Mark Johnson eliminated dual reporting positions, making all such employees responsible only to him. The incumbent, Mo Green, was sworn in to the office on January 1, 2025. He is the first black person to hold the office.

== Duties and structure ==

The superintendent of public instruction is the only constitutional officer in North Carolina assigned responsibilities solely concerning public education. The office holder is not subject to term limits. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the Governor of North Carolina has the authority to appoint a successor until a candidate is elected at the next general election for members of the General Assembly. Per Article III, Section 8 of the constitution, the superintendent sits on the Council of State. The State Board of Education is responsible for setting education policy, and the superintendent serves as the board&#x27;s secretary and chief administrative officer. The superintendent is not themselves a formal member of the board. The state constitution does not fully delineate the administrative responsibilities of the board and the superintendent, and leaves the latter&#x27;s duties to be determined by state law. The superintendent is empowered by general statute to appoint a local school system superintendent to serve as one of eight advisory members on the board. As board secretary, the superintendent is responsible for managing the board&#x27;s funds and its aid appropriations to local school boards. They also keep the board informed on public education matters, make recommendations to it, and keep its minutes. They are also required to report to the governor on the state of public education in North Carolina 30 days before each regular session of the legislature. They are an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of several state boards and commissions. They are seventh in the line of succession to the governor.

The superintendent manages the Department of Public Instruction. The department is divided into three sections each under the leadership of an assistant superintendent: Instructional and Accountability Services, Information and Technology Services, and Financial and Personnel Services. As of December 2022, the department has 886 employees retained under the terms of the State Human Resources Act. As of October 2022, two officers in the department—an internal auditor and the Director of Board Operations and Policy—report directly to both the superintendent and the Board of Education. As with all Council of State officers, the superintendent&#x27;s salary is fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their term of office. In 2022, the superintendent&#x27;s annual salary was $146,421. They maintain an office in the Department of Public Instruction building.

<doc id="1064772" wikidata="Q7890726" url="?curid=1064772" title="United States Marine Corps School of Infantry">
<text>The School of Infantry (SOI) is the second stage of initial military training for enlisted United States Marines after recruit training. The ITB (Infantry Training Battalion) now called IMC (Infantry Marine Course) went from a 59-day course to 14 week course. Since the initial training pipeline is divided between coasts, Marines from areas east of the Mississippi River usually graduate from MCRD Parris Island and move on to SOI at SOI East (located at Camp Geiger, a satellite facility of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina), while those from the western half of the nation attend MCRD San Diego and move on to SOI West at the Camp San Onofre area of Camp Pendleton in California. Female Marines are trained at both SOI East and SOI West. The School of Infantry&#x27;s training mission ensures &quot;Every Marine is, first and foremost, a Rifleman&quot;. At SOI, Marines with the Military Occupational Specialty of infantry (0300 occupational field) are trained at the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), while all non-infantry Marines are trained in basic infantry and combat skills at the Marine Combat Training Battalion (MCT Bn). SOI marks a transition in the professional training of entry-level students from basically trained Marines to combat-ready Marines.

==History==
Prior to 1953, there was no formal infantry training in the Marine Corps, and all Marines received combat training at recruit training. The Marine Corps established Infantry Training Regiments at Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton in that year. Between 1954 and 1966, all Marines received 13 weeks of Boot Camp (Basic Training) and 8 weeks of Infantry Training Regiment (ITR) regardless of their Primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), growing out of the philosophy that all Marines are riflemen first. Because of manpower demands for Vietnam, in 1966 Boot Camp training was reduced from 13 weeks to 8 weeks, and ITR was reduced from 8 weeks to 4 weeks. However, by late 1968 these were returned to their 13-week and 8 week lengths, as manpower demands were satisfied by recruiting efforts, as well as by Selective Service inductees volunteering for a Marine Corps option.

In 1971, infantry skills training for non-infantry Marines was folded into recruit training and entailed only 60 training hours. During the late 1970s and through the 1980s, Marines assigned an Infantry MOS went to Infantry Training School, commonly referred to as &quot;ITS&quot;. This lasted until the Marine Corps established Marine Combat Training as a 28-day course in 1989 to teach rifleman skills to all male Marines. In 1996, the 2nd Marine Division disbanded Division Schools, passing the role of advanced infantry training to the newly established Advanced Infantry Training Company at the SOI. Prior to 1997, only male Marines were trained at SOI schools; females went directly to their MOS schools.

==Training==

The training is accomplished with a combination of classroom instruction, hands-on practical application, and live-fire experience. The Marine Combat Instructors at SOI provide continuity and consistency in the continuum of training and mentoring entry-level Marines. Also trained at the SOI, these instructors began earning the MOS 0913 (formerly MOS 8513) in 2003.

===Infantry Training Battalion===

The Infantry Training Battalion&#x27;s mission is to train and qualify Marines in entry level infantry military occupational specialties to provide the Operating Forces and Marine Forces Reserve with Marines capable of conducting expeditionary combat operations.

Infantry Training Battalion was a 59-day training course that develops new Marines into infantrymen &quot;who can fight, survive, and win in a combat situation&quot;. The first two weeks are a common skills package that all infantry MOSs share, where Marines receive instruction in combat marksmanship, use of grenades, identifying and countering improvised explosive devices, convoy operations, Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), tactical formations, land navigation, and patrolling. Afterward, Marines receive instruction specific to their infantry MOS, regarding machine guns, mortars, reconnaissance, or anti-tank warfare. The training cycle includes physical conditioning via physical training, conditioning marches, and sustainment training in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Leadership traits and the application of the core values in every aspect of the Marine&#x27;s life are also emphasized.

Starting in January 2021, the Infantry Training Battalion underwent a restructure of its 59-day training cycle, informally called the Basic Infantry Marine (BIM) Course, to the current 14 week Infantry Marine Course (IMC). This was done in accordance with Force Design 2030, that seeks to have basic entry level Marines trained to a higher level than their BIM cycle counterparts by requiring a ground level course structure for all Marines training for the MOS 0311 and then having a more advance course for Marines training in the MOS 0331, 0341, and 0352. Infantry Marines are not only expected to know the previous skills from the BIM cycle but are now also expected to be entry level trained in the roles of other infantry MOS&#x27;s and other fieldcraft and demolitions skills. Upon completion of the Infantry Marine Course, Marines earn the MOS 0311 before being sent off to the Fleet Marine Force as an MOS 0311 or continue on to an addition school to be trained in a different MOS in the 0300 Occupational Field. Marines that are designated as MOS 0331, 0341, or 0352 are sent to the Infantry Weapons Course (IWC) to begin training as either a machine gunner, mortarman, or anti-tank guided missleman for an additional 4 weeks of training in those MOS roles.

===Marine Combat Training===
Marine Combat Training (MCT) is a 29-day course in which entry-level non-infantry Marines are taught the common skills needed in combat. Marines learn the basics of combat marksmanship, counter-improvised explosive device techniques, how to conduct the defense of a position, convoy operations, combat formations, fireteam assaults, patrolling, MOUT, use of the AN/PRC-119 radio, reporting military intelligence, land navigation, and the use of hand grenades, the M203 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, and M240 machine gun. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, conducting marches, physical training, and MCMAP. Upon completion of MCT, the Marine is to have gained the knowledge and ability to operate in a combat environment as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her primary duties under fire.

===Advanced Infantry Training Battalion===
The Advanced Infantry Training Battalion (AITB) conducts additional training for those infantry Marines who have an MOS other than 0311, as well as advanced skills, MOS validation, leadership, and qualifications to infantry Marines who have advanced in their careers. The east and west coast stations have slightly different subordinate units.

* The Light Armored Vehicle Training Company trains entry-level infantry MOS-qualified Armored Vehicle crewmen and trains infantry officers and SNCOs in the tactical employment of the Light Armored Vehicle, and awards the MOSs 0313 and 0303.
* The Reconnaissance Training Company mentors and safely trains Marines in reconnaissance skills, in preparation for assignment to a reconnaissance unit. Graduates of the Basic Reconnaissance Course are awarded the MOS 0321.
* The Scout Sniper Basic Course provides instruction in advanced marksmanship with the M40A1 sniper rifle and the M82A1A Special Application Scoped Rifle, small bore marksmanship training with the M40, and qualification with the M9 pistol. Instruction includes stalking and concealment techniques, range estimation, observation techniques, hide construction, land navigation, tracking, field communications, selection and occupation of positions, field sketch, observation log, range card, and patrol log construction and maintenance, terrain model construction, and night/thermal imaging device usage and anti-detection techniques. Tactical instruction includes detailed mission planning, preparation and conduct, scout-sniper employment, patrolling, and collecting and reporting information.
* The Infantry Squad Leaders Course is designed to provide Marine Noncommissioned Officers with the required skills and knowledge to be an infantry squad leader. A Marine receives training in rifleman core competencies, war-fighting and decision making, troop leading procedures, advanced land navigation, how to call for indirect fire, small unit training, communications, infantry rifle company crew-served weapons, munitions and pyrotechnics, scouting and patrolling, defensive and offensive tactics and techniques.
* The Infantry Mortars Leaders Course trains Marines to serve as a section leader for the M224 mortar section of an infantry weapons platoon or to serve as a squad leader, plotter, or section leader for an M252 mortar platoon in an infantry weapons company.
* The Infantry Machinegun Leaders Course provides Marines with the knowledge and skills required to serve as a machine gun squad leader for a machine gun section of an infantry weapons platoon, or to serve as a heavy machine gun squad leader, or a heavy machine gun section leader for a heavy machine gun platoon of an infantry weapons company.
* The Infantry Anti-Tank Missileman Leaders Course is designed to provide Marines with the knowledge and skills required to perform as a FGM-148 Javelin squad leader, team leader, and gunner and as an anti-tank missileman squad leader or section leader in an anti-armor platoon or a Combined Anti-Armor Team platoon in an infantry weapons company.
* The Infantry Assaultman Leaders Course provides a Marine with the knowledge and skills required to serve as an assaultman squad leader for an assaultman section of an infantry weapons platoon.
* The Infantry Unit Leaders Training Company provides skill progression training to ensure Staff Noncommissioned Officers are proficient in advanced infantry skills, developed in their decision-making process, making practical use of their infantry experience, and equipped to assume increased levels of responsibility for infantry unit leadership. The course provides instruction in machine gunnery, mortar gunnery, anti-armor operations, Marine Corps leadership, Marine Corps planning process, law of land warfare, anti-terrorism and force protection, written communications, verbal communications, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and personnel administration, section and platoon leadership, platoon/company defensive and offensive tactics, platoon patrolling, and fire support to leaders in the MOSs of 0369, 0302, and 0306.
* The Mobile Training Company conducts &quot;train the trainer&quot;, Tactical Small Unit Leader Course, Combat Hunter, and other standards based training as directed to enhance the ability of unit commanders to conduct training that supports their mission.
* Infantry Operations Chief Course is designed to train senior enlisted Marines in the knowledge and skills required to perform the duties of an Infantry Operations Chief in an infantry battalion. Topics that are covered include: training and education in unit training management, ground combat element operations, combat operations center operations, the Marine Corps planning process, fire support coordination, and the Command and Control Personal Computer system.
* Marine Combat Instructors School prepares instructors in the knowledge and skills required to formally train entry-level Marines at the SOI. The Marine receives training in coaching skills for individual and crew served weapons and optics, reinforcement of both day and night land navigation, communications, CPR and first aid procedures, combat marksmanship, the Combat Life Saver program, scouting, patrolling, improvised explosive devices, Guardian Angel, and convoy operations. Graduates of the school receive the MOS 0913.
* The Martial Arts Instructor Course certifies Marines as Martial Arts Instructors (MAI) (secondary MOS 0916, formerly 8551) in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program by providing the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to conduct all aspects of training. The graduating student will have the capability to certify Marines at belt levels the same as his or her own; supervise sustainment and integration training; conduct the combative sports program; and conduct the combat conditioning program. In order to obtain instructor qualifications for a higher belt, Marines must first meet the belt requirements and progress through the training program. In order to become a Martial Arts Instructor Trainer (MAIT), which can also certify green, brown, and black belt (1st Degree) instructors, they must go through a seven-week MAIT course at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Once the black belt is obtained, Marines can acquire up to six degrees of black belt training, distinguished by Tan (MAI) or Red (MAIT) stripes on the right side of the belt.

<doc id="1064790" wikidata="Q7187185" url="?curid=1064790" title="Phone Losers of America">
<text>The Phone Losers of America (PLA) is an internet prank call community founded in 1994 as a phone phreaking and hacking e-zine. Today the PLA hosts a prank call podcast called the &quot;Snow Plow Show&quot;, which it has hosted since 2012.

== History ==
The Phone Losers of America were founded by Brad Carter and Zak (el_jefe) in 1994, in an era when landlines were plentiful. Zak currently maintains a USA payphone directory.

The PLA text files continued until mid-1997.

In the early 2000s, with the introduction of companies offering Caller ID Spoofing, groups such as the Phone Losers of America became notable in their utilisation of the service for prank calling, for example in the spoofing of law enforcement and corporate office numbers.

In August 2015, the Columbia Daily Tribune in Columbia, Missouri, featured the PLA in an article about a series of &quot;strange calls&quot; received by local residents who had signed a petition against a crosswalk construction project. The article quoted an FBI representative who allegedly told the &quot;Tribune&quot; that the calls to Columbia residents &quot;would likely be prosecuted on the local level.&quot; 

In early November 2016, Carter reported that the FBI performed an early-morning raid on his recording studio, resulting in a temporary seizure of all technical equipment. The raid was triggered by an attempt to access customer profiles at numerous retail stores across the country, primarily Safeway, of which some were utilized for prank phone calls. The case was treated as a federal matter, and was presided over by Judge Marco A. Hernandez of the Federal District Court of Oregon. On October 16, 2017, Judge Hernandez sentenced Carter to eight months of home detention, followed by five years of probation. Carter must pay $19,600 in restitution to Safeway as a consequence.

==Activities==

The PLA maintains an archive of answer machine messages in text-based format, which Motherboard have described as being the &quot;ringtones of their day&quot;.

<doc id="1064796" wikidata="Q1781723" url="?curid=1064796" title="Murang'a County">
<text>Murang&#x27;a County is one of the counties of Kenya&#x27;s former Central Province. Its largest town and capital is Murang&#x27;a, which was referred to as Fort Hall during the colonial era. The county is inhabited mainly by, and is considered the birthplace of the Gikuyu, the largest ethnic group in Kenya. The county had a population of 1,056,640 in the 2019 census.

==History==
When missionaries first came to Kenya, they found the Coast Region already inhabited by Portuguese who had taken the coast strategically for trade from Arab powers in the 16th century. The missionaries ventured into Kenya&#x27;s rugged interior and Murang&#x27;a was one of the first places they settled.

When the British set up the East African Protectorate in 1895, their first administrative post (Fort Smith) was located in Murang&#x27;a.

One of the main highlights of Murang&#x27;a&#x27;s history, however, is the Mau Mau uprising that was led by the Agikuyu community who consider Murang&#x27;a their ancestral origin. Murang&#x27;a is thus considered, at least by some, the birthplace of the Kenyan independence movement.

Missionaries had initially been welcomed by Karuri Wagakure who was the chief of Tuthu. They set up the first mission church in Kenya at Murang&#x27;a.

Murang&#x27;a is also the source of Rivers Maragua, which originates from the heart of the Aberdare Range, Mathioya, Kayahwe, Irati and Muriurio among others.

Additionally, Murang&#x27;a is known for its fertile soil and good climate, which are good for farming. Among the food crops grown in this county include maize, beans, sweet potatoes, arrow roots, pumpkins, and bananas.

Tea and coffee are the county&#x27;s main cash crops.

== County government ==
The Constitution of Kenya (2010) created 47 regional governments with the formerly larger Murang&#x27;a district as a county. The County Government has two arms, and these are; the County Assembly and the County Executive.
The county uses the code 021 on the national coding scheme and locals famously refer to the county as Metumi.

=== Executive ===
From 2013 to 2022, the Executive arm was headed by Hon. Mwangi wa Iria, who was deputized by Hon Gakure Monyo during his first term and Hon Maina Kamau in his second term. In his last term, Mwangi wa Iria was assisted by a team of ministerial members referred to as County Executive Committee (CEC), which had ten other members. The individuals and their portfolios included:
Following the end of the two terms of governorship by Mwangi wa Iria as stipulated by the Kenyan Law, Murang&#x27;a County voters voted in Dr. Francis Irungu Kang’ata as their second Governor in August 2022 general elections. Governor Francis Irungu took Oath of Office on 25 August 2022, together with his deputy Stephen Mburu Munania, who became the third Deputy Governor of Murang&#x27;a County.

=== County Assembly ===
Murang’a County Assembly is located in Murang’a town along Kiria-ini Road. The Assembly is housed in the building formerly occupied by the Municipal Council of Murang’a.

Murang’a County has 35 MCAs, a speaker and 16 nominated members. The position of the Speaker of the Assembly was formerly held by Hon. Leonard Nduati, deputized by Hon. Moses Gachui. Johnson Mukuha was voted in as the new Speaker in September 2022 by the majority of Members of County Assembly (MCAs). The Assembly is administratively managed by Clerk to the Assembly, a post formerly occupied by Peter Ndegwa Mbue. The current Clerk to the Assembly is Mr. Kuria Thuita.

<doc id="1064800" wikidata="Q1063111" url="?curid=1064800" title="Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis">
<text>James Samuel &quot;Jimmy Jam&quot; Harris III (born June 6, 1959) and Terry Steven Lewis (born November 24, 1956) are an American R&amp;B/pop songwriting and record production team. Their productions have received commercial success since the 1980s with various artists, most extensively Janet Jackson. They have written 31 top ten hits in the UK and 41 in the US. In 2022, the duo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence category.

==History==
Jimmy Jam is the son of Cornbread Harris, a Minneapolis blues and jazz musician. Jimmy Jam met Lewis while attending an Upward Bound program on the University of Minnesota campus.

In the mid-1970s, Harris formed or joined Mind &amp; Matter, an 11 piece band.

Lewis had been in the band Flyte Tyme, which Harris joined late in its history and which Prince restructured as the Time in 1981. As members of the Time, they played instruments on all but one of the group&#x27;s five albums (Ice Cream Castle), including &quot;Condensate&quot; which the group recorded as the Original 7ven.

In 1982, Jam and Lewis were introduced to music executive Dina R. Andrews, who was then an employee of Dick Griffey&#x27;s SOLAR Records, where they would be mentored by record producer Leon Sylvers III. The pair asked Andrews to manage them, and through her relationships, Andrews first introduced the duo to Clarence Avant. They produced their first work for Avant for the S.O.S. Band. Andrews set up Jam and Lewis&#x27;s company Flyte Tyme Productions and shopped them to her music industry colleagues. Jam and Lewis went on to produce several other acts for Avant under Dina Andrews Management for the S.O.S. Band, Cherrelle, Alexander O&#x27;Neal and Change. Additionally, Andrews shopped the duo to many of the executives and artists who used her services, such as Klymaxx, Cheryl Lynn (&quot;Encore&quot;), and executives such as A&amp;M&#x27;s John McClain (Janet Jackson).

The pair were fired by Prince after a freak Atlanta blizzard left them unable to make a tour date during which they were, unbeknown to Prince, producing music for the S.O.S. Band. However, one of the Atlanta tracks, &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot;, became a hit and established the duo&#x27;s reputation. Jam and Lewis would rejoin the Time for two albums: 1990&#x27;s &quot;Pandemonium&quot; and the 2011 album &quot;Condensate&quot; when the band went by the Original 7ven.

The duo was noted for early use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, which was used in most of its productions. After working with other artists such as Cherrelle and Alexander O&#x27;Neal, Jam and Lewis were introduced to Janet Jackson and produced her breakthrough album &quot;Control&quot; in 1986, for which the duo won a Grammy Award. Their collaboration on her next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;, proved even more successful as the album became one of the top-selling albums in history with four &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 hits. Their collaboration continued and remained highly successful, especially on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 No.1 albums &quot;janet.&quot;, &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;, &quot;All for You&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.

In 1991, they founded a record label, Perspective Records, an A&amp;M Records distributed label that has since been closed and then reactivated. Later that year, their newly minted label experienced success with the Minneapolis-based gospel/R&amp;B group Sounds of Blackness. Their debut single, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, served as a groundbreaking anthem stressing positivity and encouragement. The song served as a summer and fall anthem and began propelling Jam and Lewis&#x27; label. Other successes followed with Sounds of Blackness as well as releases from labelmates Mint Condition, Lo-Key? and Solo. In 1992, Perspective released the soundtrack for the film &quot;Mo&#x27; Money&quot;, which starred Damon Wayans, Stacey Dash and Marlon Wayans. Executive produced by Jam and Lewis, the soundtrack featured songs by Mint Condition, Ralph Tresvant and Caron Wheeler, as well as a duet by Janet Jackson and Luther Vandross.

In 2003, Jam and Lewis moved their recording operations to Santa Monica, California naming it Flyte Tyme West, due to more opportunities for work and collaboration. In 2006, they won a Grammy for Yolanda Adams&#x27; song &quot;Be Blessed&quot;, from her 2005 album &quot;Day By Day&quot;. In 2007, Jam and Lewis produced the two-time Grammy Award-winning CD &quot;Funk This&quot; for Chaka Khan, which included the Award-winning R&amp;B duet &quot;Disrespectful&quot;, with Mary J. Blige.

The production duo reunited with the Time at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008, in a medley that included the artist Rihanna, and featuring &quot;Jungle Love&quot;. In June and July 2008, all of the original members of the Time (Morris Day, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Jesse Johnson, Jerome Benton, Jellybean Johnson, and Monte Moir) reunited once again for a series of shows at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

In a career that has spanned more than four decades, Jam and Lewis have worked with a multitude of artists, including Lionel Richie, Herb Alpert, TLC, Sounds of Blackness, Yolanda Adams, Jordan Knight, Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Boyz II Men, Usher, Johnny Gill, Patti LaBelle, Mary J. Blige, Chaka Khan, Mariah Carey, Prince, Mýa, Bryan Adams, Snoop Dogg, Spice Girls, Vanessa Williams, George Michael, Melanie B, Rod Stewart, Kelly Price, Gwen Stefani, New Edition, Eric Benet, Pia Zadora, SOLO, and the Human League.

<doc id="1064805" wikidata="Q3932026" url="?curid=1064805" title="List of Irish kingdoms">
<text>This article lists some of the attested Gaelic kingdoms of early medieval Ireland prior to the Norman invasion of 1169-72.

For much of this period, the island was divided into numerous clan territories and kingdoms (known as &quot;túatha&quot;). These túatha often competed for control of resources and thus they continually grew and shrank (in both size and number). In addition to kingdoms or túatha, Gaelic Ireland was also divided into five prime overkingdoms (Old Irish &quot;cóiceda&quot;, Modern Irish &quot;cúige&quot;). These were Ulaid (in the north), Connacht (in the west), Laighin (in the southeast), Mumhan (in the south) and Mide (in the centre).

After the Norman invasion, much of the island came under the control of the Lordship of Ireland, although some parts remained under the control of Gaelic dynasties. After 1350, Norman control began to weaken, and a &quot;Gaelic resurgence&quot;
took place which resulted in the direct influence of the Parliament of Ireland shrinking to an area known as The Pale by 1500. In 1541 the Kingdom of Ireland was established by Henry VIII and the Tudor conquest of Ireland commenced. The repudiation of the terms of the Treaty of Mellifont by the Crown resulted in the Nine Years War and the Flight of the Earls, which marked the end of the Gaelic order.

<text>The Hardy Monument (sometimes referred to as Hardy&#x27;s Monument) is a monument on the summit of Black Down near Portesham in Dorset. It was erected in 1844 by public subscription in memory of Vice Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, flag captain of Admiral Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. It has been owned by National Trust since 1938, when it was bought for £15, and is regularly opened for visitors can climb the 120 steps to the viewpoint at the top.

Admiral Hardy lived in Portesham and his family owned the Portesham estate which stretched from the middle of Portesham to Black Down. The site for the monument, a hill overlooking the English Channel, was chosen because the Hardy family wanted a monument which could be used as a landmark for shipping. The monument has been shown on navigational charts since 1846 and is visible from a distance of .

The monument was designed to look like a spyglass, as Admiral Hardy would have used on board ship. Its eight corners are aligned with the compass points. Viewed from the ground the corner to the right of the lightning conductor points due south. The bench mark on the northwest face denotes the altitude of Black Down at .

From the top of the monument at a height of above sea level it is possible on a clear day to see the coast from Start Point, Devon to St. Catherine&#x27;s Point on the Isle of Wight, both of which are distant. To the north can be seen Pen Hill in the Mendip Hills which is away.
The monument was designated as a grade II listed building in 1956. It has had several major renovations during its history. It was restored in 1900 by Hardy&#x27;s descendants, and again by the National Trust in 2009-12. 

Adjacent to the monument is a stone seat erected in memory of Lt Col William Digby Oswald who was killed on the Somme in 1916.

==Geodesy==
The Hardy Monument was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps for Somerset and Dorset.

<doc id="1064810" wikidata="Q2034844" url="?curid=1064810" title="Catholic Church in Thailand">
<text>The Catholic Church in Thailand is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

According to Catholic Social Communications of Thailand, there are 388,468 Catholics in Thailand, a figure that represents about 0.58% of the Thai population of 69 million. There are 11 dioceses with 526 parishes and 662 priests.

==History==

The first historical record of an attempt to introduce Christianity to Thailand is owed to John Peter Maffei who stated that about 1550 a French Franciscan named Bonferre, hearing of the great kingdom of the Peguans and the Siamese in the East, went on a Portuguese ship from Goa to Cosme (Peguan), where for three years he preached the Gospel, but without any converts. 

In 1552 Francis Xavier, writing from Sancian to his friend Diego Pereira, expressed his desire to go to Siam, but his death on 2 December 1552, prevented him. In 1553 several Portuguese ships landed in Siam, and at the request of the king three hundred Portuguese soldiers entered his service. The following year two Dominicans, Fathers Hieronymus of the Cross and Sebastian de Cantù, joined them as chaplains. In a short time, they established three parishes at Ayutthaya with about fifteen hundred converted Siamese. Both missionaries, however, were murdered by locals in 1569, and were replaced by Fathers Lopez Cardoso, John Madeira, Alphonsus Ximenes, Louis Fonseca (martyred in 1600), and John Maldonatus (d. 1598).

===17th century===
In 1606 the Jesuit Balthasar de Sequeira, at the request of the Portuguese merchant Tristan Golayo, and in 1624 Father Julius Cesar Margico, came to Ayutthaya and gained the favour of the king. A subsequent persecution, however, stopped the propagation of the Christian faith and no missionaries were allowed until Siam was made a Vicariate Apostolic by Pope Alexander VII on 22 August 1662. Soon after, Msgr. Pierre de la Motte-Lambert, Vicar-Apostolic of Cochin China, arrived at Ayutthaya, accompanied by Fathers De Bourges and Deydier. In 1664 he was joined by Msgr. Pallu, Vicar Apostolic of Tong King. Siam, in those days a rendezvous of commercial enterprise in the East, gave shelter to several hundred Annamite and Japanese Christians who had been expelled or lived there as exiles due to persecutions at home. 

Some Portuguese and Spanish Jesuits, Franciscans, and Augustinians provided the spiritual care of their countrymen in Siam. Msgr. Pallu, on his return to Rome (1665), obtained a Brief from Pope Clement IX (4 July 1669), by which the Vicariate of Siam was entrusted to the newly founded Society of Foreign Missions of Paris. In 1673 Father Laneau was consecrated titular Bishop of Metellopolis and first Vicar Apostolic of Siam, and ever since Siam has been under the spiritual care of the Society of Foreign Missions. King Phra Narai gave the Catholic missionaries a hearty welcome, and made them a gift of land for a church, a mission-house, and a seminary (St. Joseph&#x27;s colony). Through the influence of the Greek or Venetian, Constantine Phaulkon, prime minister to King Narai, the latter sent a diplomatic embassy to Louis XIV in 1684. The French king returned the compliment by sending M. de Chaumont, accompanied by some Jesuits under Fathers de Fontenay and Guy Tachard. 

On 10 December 1685, King Naraï signed a treaty at Louvo (Lopburi) with France, in which he permitted Catholic missionaries to preach the Gospel throughout Siam, exempted his Catholic subjects from work on Sunday, and appointed a special mandarin to settle disputes between Christians and others. However, after the departure of M. De Chaumont, a Siamese nobleman, Phra-phret-racha, instigated a revolution in which Greece&#x27;s Minister to Ayutthaya was murdered, King Naraï deposed, Msgr. Laneau and several missionaries were taken prisoners and ill-treated, and Siamese Christians were persecuted. 

When peace and order were restored in 1690, Bishop Laneau resumed work until his death in 1696. His successor, Bishop Louis of Cice (1700–1727), was able to continue it in peace. However, after his death the rest of the century is a history of persecutions (those of 1729, 1755, 1764 are the most notable), either by local nobles or Burmese invaders, though the kings remained more or less favourable to the missionaries and to Bishops Texier de Kerlay and de Lolière-Puycontat (1755). During the inroads of the Burmese, the Siamese king even appealed to Bishop Brigot for help against the common foe, who sacked and burned the Catholic stations and colleges and imprisoned both the bishop and the missionaries. 

In 1769 Father Corre resumed the missions in Siam and thus paved the way for the new vicar Apostolic, Msgr. Lebon (1772–80). However, a fresh persecution in 1775 forced him to leave the kingdom, and neither of his successors, Bishops Condé and Garnault, was able to accomplish much. During the Burmese wars, the Christians were reduced in number from 12,000 to 1000, and Bishop Florens was left in charge with only seven native priests.

===19th century===
It was only in 1826 and 1830 that a fresh supply of European missionaries arrived, among them Fathers Bouchot, Barbe, Bruguière, Vachal, Grandjean, Pallegoix, and Courvezy. In 1834 the last was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Siam, and the missions began to revive. Under him Siam numbered 6,590 Catholics and 11 European and seven native priests. His successor, Bishop Pallegoix (1840–1862), author of &quot;Description du royaume Thai ou Siam&quot; and &quot;Dictionnaire siamois-latin-français-anglais&quot; (30,000 words), was one of the most distinguished vicars Apostolic of Siam, the best Siamese scholar, and a missionary among the Laotines. He induced Napoleon III to renew the French alliance with Siam and to send an embassy under M. de Montigny to Siam in 1856. On 8 July 1856, King Mongkut signed a political-commercial treaty with France, by which the privileges granted to the Catholic missionaries by Phra-Naraï in the 17th century were renewed. The bishop was highly esteemed by the king, who personally assisted at his funeral and accepted from the missionaries as a token of friendship the bishop&#x27;s ring. 

Thanks to the broad-mindedness of Kings Mongkut (1851–1868) and Chulalongkorn (1868–1910), the Catholic Church in Siam enjoyed peace under Pallegoix&#x27;s successors, Bishops Dupont (1862–1872) and Vey (1875–1909). Owing to the complications between France and Siam, in 1894, the missionaries had to endure the ill will of local mandarins, though the minister of foreign affairs promised that no harm would be done to the missionaries and their work on account of the French invasion.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were about 23,000 Catholic believers, 55 churches and chapels, representatives of such monastic orders, social and educational institutions (e.g., orphanages, schools and a seminary, college). During the 20th century, many other Catholic congregations arrived to work in Thailand. 

In 1975 the Catholic Office for Emergency Relief and Refugees was established for protection of moral values and social work, including the urgent problem created by refugees from Indochina.

Pope John Paul II became the first pope to visit Thailand, 10–11 May 1984. The pope told King Rama IX Bhumibol Adulyadej that his visit was not only to return the courtesy when the king visited his predecessor Pope John XXIII in 1960 but to also personally thank Thailand for welcoming refugees which he said was an exemplary example of humanity. King Rama IX told the pope he observed how Christianity had grown in the kingdom and recognized how the relationship between Thailand and the Vatican first began hundreds of years earlier during the Ayutthaya Kingdom.

On 22 October 1989, the &quot;Martyrs of Thailand&quot; were beatified. The catechist Philip Siphong Onphitak and six companions had been killed in 1940 as suspected French spies at a time when Thailand was at war with the French.

===21st century===
In 2003, there were 278,000 Catholics in Thailand, which constituted 0.44% of the total population at the time.

Some members of the Catholic religious orders in Thailand (Religious of the Good Shepherd, Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres) take an active part in fight against human trafficking.

Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra visited the Vatican on 13 September 2013 where she met Pope Francis. Her visit was the first to the Holy See by a Thai governmental leader in over 50 years. At this meeting Yingluck formally invited Pope Francis to visit Thailand, although no dates were discussed at the time.

Pope Francis visited Thailand from 19–23 November 2019 as part of an Asian tour, the first such papal visit since that of Pope John Paul II in 1984. The papal visit marks the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the Apostolic Vicariate of Siam, which brought Catholicism to Thailand in 1669, as well as the 50th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between Thailand and the Vatican. While in Thailand he had audiences with the prime minister, King Vajiralongkorn, and the supreme Buddhist patriarch, as well as celebrating masses at the National Stadium and Assumption Cathedral.

<text>John Harold Force (born May 4, 1949) is an American NHRA drag racer. He is a 16-time NHRA and 1 time AHRA Funny Car champion driver and a 22-time champion car owner. Force owns and drives for John Force Racing (JFR). He is one of the most dominant drag racers in the sport with 157 career victories. He graduated from Bell Gardens High School and briefly attended Cerritos Junior College to play football. He is the father of drag racers Ashley Force Hood, Brittany Force, and Courtney Force. His oldest daughter Adria Hight is the CFO of JFR.

Current drivers racing for Force&#x27;s team are Austin Prock, and daughter Brittany. Mike Neff was crew chief for John two separate times. Effective July 2013 Jimmy Prock replaced Mike Neff as crew chief, and Mike Neff became crew chief for Robert Hight. Neff, who was once the crew chief for rival driver Gary Scelzi, raced in a 4th Funny Car for JFR from October 26, 2007, following the death of Eric Medlen, until the end of the 2009 season. However, in 2010, after a 2009 season in which Force did not win a single race, Force parked his 4th car, and named Neff as his new crew chief instead. This decision resulted in Force winning his 15th NHRA Championship. His nickname among several of the drivers, as well as several announcers within the sport of drag racing is &quot;Brute Force&quot;, a nickname he earned by his dominating wins during his run of ten straight NHRA championships. Force, his daughters, Courtney, Ashley, and Brittany, granddaughter Autumn Hight (granddaughter) and her father Robert Hight are collectively known as &quot;The First Family of Drag Racing&quot;.

==Early life==

Force was born to Harold and Betty Ruth Force in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell Gardens, California. As a child he lived in logging camps, Indian reservations, migrant farms, and trailer parks. He survived childhood polio with therapy and perseverance of his mother and family. He played football in high school and attended Cerritos College. John is one of six children. John has five siblings, Walker, Louie, Tom (now deceased), and Cindy Hem (married to late husband Skip Hem) were all older than John. Dana (Baby Force) Marino is ten years younger than John. Walker and Cindy still live near John in Southern California. Walker Force and Louie Force have worked with John over the years, but Walker Force is the only sibling now working at JFR. Younger sister Dana (Marino) did not grow up in the same house or spend any time with the family in the early years of the Force Family Racing activities. Dana now attends some of the NHRA events as she is a part-time Intern-Journalist with &quot;The Motorsports Report&quot; based in Las Vegas, Nevada, and resides an hour south in Kingman, AZ. She is a realtor by trade, but is Aunt Dana to Adria, Ashley, Courtney and Brittany. Much of the family still attends NHRA National events to cheer on John, Robert Hight (Adria&#x27;s husband), Brittany and Austin Prock (JFR Crew Chief Jimmy Prock&#x27;s son) when the events are closer to their homes in Pomona, Las Vegas, Sonoma, and Phoenix.

==1978–2004==
In 1971, Force drove the Jack Chrisman-built &quot;Night Stalker&quot; Mustang, his first funny car. Early in his career, he drove a Corvette, a Monza and then in the 1980s switched to an Oldsmobile Cutlass through the end of the 1993 season. He drove a Chevrolet for 1994, quickly changing to a Pontiac in 1995 and 1996. Force was a Ford driver and team owner from 1997 until 2014, when he returned to Chevrolet.

1985-Travel back in time to an era when John Force was trying to find his place in a drag racing world in Spokane, Wash., at the ADRA World Finals in the latter years of the old American Hot Rod Association. It was part of the syndicated Pro Drag Superstars series. Both Johnny West and John Force were tied at 1650 Points. John Force beat Johnny West in the finals with a time of 5.87 seconds at 252.10 miles per hour 1/4 mile run in the Coca-Cola Wendy&#x27;s Funny Car. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-6Jk_gTgk

Between 1987 and 1996, Force won sixty-seven of 203 NHRA national events, four of nine Big Bud Shootouts, and six World Championships. In 1996, with Austin Coil tuning, Force went to the final round in sixteen of nineteen national events, taking thirteen wins, one of the best records ever in Funny Car history. His domination would continue, with ten NHRA FC World Championship wins from 1993 to 2002, including six straight 1997-2002; his success was so amazing, he was accused of cheating (and was willing to strip off his firesuit to prove he was not). Between 1997 and 2006, Force went to the final in 105 of 228 events and took sixty-one tour wins. On top of that, he had ten of the quickest or fastest passes in Funny Car.

In 1992, the honor of putting Force on the trailer would go to Cruz Pedregon, driving the Larry Minor McDonald&#x27;s-sponsored Olds to the championship.

Force&#x27;s points finishes were 23rd, 8th, 26th, 16th, 20th, 4th, 13th, and 5th from 1978 to 1985. Force then had Castrol Motor Oil jump on as his main sponsor, and was even more successful. From 1986 to 1995, he finished 4th, 4th, 6th, 1st, 1st, 2nd, 1st, 1st, and 1st. He then had fellow driver and arch-rival Cruz Pedregon&#x27;s younger brother, Tony, come aboard to drive John&#x27;s 2nd car. From 1996 to 2000, John finished 1st all 5 years. In 2001, John had longtime friend and fellow drag racer Gary Densham drive a third car. In that same year, John once again finished as the champion, which he followed up with an astronomical 10th straight world title in 2002. In 2003, for the 1st time since 1992, John didn&#x27;t win the title. It was not all lost however, because teammate Tony Pedregon won his 1st world title. At the end of the season, Tony Pedregon went on to join brother Cruz in their own racing organization, and Gary Densham went on to race independently. John found quick and personal talent in two young-guns. Eric Medlen, son of long-time JFR crewmember John Medlen, came on to race. John&#x27;s other driver, Robert Hight, was his son-in-law and crewmember. Both had a lot of success in their season, but John topped both in 2004 with a 13th world title.

In 2000, Force was sponsored by BP&#x27;s Castrol brand, continuing the relationship between Force and Castrol that began in 1985 and lasted through 2014. After winning his fourth Funny Car title in 1994, Force earned the nickname of &quot;Brute Force&quot; from drivers, and even announcers such as Steve Evans. This nickname hearkens back to his early days on the track, when he drove his own unsponsored car, named &quot;Brute Force&quot;. Force guest starred as himself in a 2004 episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (&quot;Dale Be Not Proud&quot;), in which Dale Gribble donates a kidney to Force, after which it appears he does not need it.

==2005==

In 2005, Force won 5 events, but only finished third in the championship standings, 32 points behind champion Gary Scelzi, and 24 points behind Ron Capps, both of Don Schumacher Racing [DSR].

==2006==

In 2006, Force won his 14th NHRA World Funny Car Championship, defeating Capps in the quarter-finals of the Automobile Club of Southern California NHRA Finals which mathematically eliminated Capps and teammate Robert Hight from the championship. Force went on to win the event, his third of the season and 122nd of his career.

==2007==

After the death of Eric Medlen, and John Force&#x27;s crash in Ennis, Texas at the 2007 O&#x27;Reilly NHRA Fall Nationals, Force started 2007 poorly, suffering a DNQ ending a 20+ year consecutive qualifying streak. He rebounded, winning the O&#x27;Reilly NHRA Thunder Valley Nationals in Bristol, Tennessee, then proceeded on to three more final rounds, winning another race in Sonoma, California, putting him fourth in points and allowing him to make the first cut in NHRA&#x27;s new point system, the Countdown to the Championship aka the &quot;Countdown to Eight&quot;. He stumbled again in the next two races but, again, rebounded until his crash.

On September 23, 2007, Force was injured in a crash at the O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts Fall Nationals in Ennis, Texas as he crossed the finish line against Kenny Bernstein. Bernstein&#x27;s Funny Car drifted into Force&#x27;s lane, clipping the final timing cone and a foam block which shot into Force&#x27;s lane. Initially, it was thought that the block ruptured Force&#x27;s left rear tire, causing it to come apart, violently shaking the chassis until it broke apart. However, it was determined by NHRA after a thorough review, that the block went behind Force&#x27;s tire and was not the cause of the wreck. Injuries sustained were a broken ankle, abrasion of his right knee, a dislocated left wrist, and badly mangled fingers and toes, and Force had to be airlifted to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. Phil Burkart Jr. was added as Force&#x27;s replacement for the remainder of the 2007 season, starting at Las Vegas.

==2008==

2008 was a subpar season for Force who finished 7th, out of the top five for the first time since early in his career. However, after the death of driver Scott Kalitta, he was instrumental in the development of some of the safety precautions that were implemented throughout the rest of the season, and along with retired six-time world champion Kenny Bernstein [4 Funny Car titles, 2 Top Fuel titles] and seven-time Top Fuel champion Tony Schumacher, with backing from NHRA&#x27;s Track Safety Committee, assisted in developing a sensor that monitors the engines of Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars. Should the engine backfire at any time during a race, the fuel pump is automatically shut down, and the parachutes are deployed. The idea was to either minimize or eliminate the circumstances that led to Kalitta&#x27;s death. This safety device became mandatory and was put into place at the start of the 2009 season. Also, a brake handle that, instead of needing to be pulled back toward the driver, was set up to be pushed away from the driver was made an optional setting for the Funny Car division. This change happened because when the 2008 season began, Force&#x27;s right arm was still in a cast, due to broken fingers, and he needed a different way of using the brakes on the car, rather than the traditional handbrake that needed to be brought back toward the driver; also, in the 2007 accident in Texas, Force had lost some grip in his right hand, and had some problems putting enough pressure on the handbrake to unlock it from position to apply the brakes. This led to the development of the forward application handbrake, which has given several drivers in the Funny Car class quicker access to the brakes. Though Force only finished seventh in the points in 2008, he became influential within the NHRA for innovations in driver safety.

==2009==

2009 once again saw Force finish outside of the top five. John finished 9th, daughter Ashley finished 2nd, and Mike Neff placing 10th. However, he would win his 16th overall championship as a car owner, with teammate Robert Hight&#x27;s championship, placing Force as the winningest car owner in NHRA history.

==2010==

The start of the 2010 season saw Force celebrate 25 years with the same sponsor, as well as 34 years in the NHRA. On February 14, Force won the season opener at Auto Club Raceway at Pomona in the 50th Winternationals in California defeating Ron Capps. After 13 events, Force had 4 wins, and lead the Funny Car points standings with 933, 58 ahead of teammate Robert Hight.

Going into the Auto Club of Southern California Finals in Pomona, CA on November 14, 2010, Force needed some help to win the championship. He started the day 38 points behind 28-year-old Matt Hagan, who ran for team rival Don Shumacher and his team. In order to capture the championship he needed to finish two rounds ahead of Hagan. With Bob Tasca III taking Hagan out in the first round, Force won his first round over Gary Densham and second-round win over Bob Bode, securing the championship. He then went on to victory beating Melanie Troxel in the semi-finals and in the final, defeated Jeff Arend. John Force now has the distinction of being the oldest NHRA champion in history. Long-time crew chief Austin Coil resigned from John Force Racing on November 16, 2010.

==2011==

As of February 7, 2011, JFR has already flip-flopped cars between John, Robert, Ashley, and Mike. Ashley Force Hood announced that she was expecting her 1st child, and would sit out the 2011 Full Throttle Drag Racing Season. John Force would drive Force Hood&#x27;s new Ford Mustang with Dean Antonelli and Ron Douglas tuning, sponsored by Castrol Motor Oil. Robert Hight will remain in the Auto Club of Southern California Ford Mustang. Mike Neff, after co-crew chiefing John Force&#x27;s car with Austin Coil, will drive Force&#x27;s car from John&#x27;s 2010 championship season. Neff&#x27;s Ford Mustang will be sponsored by Castrol Oil. As of February 7, 2011, JFR started testing for the 2011 season. Out of the 11 testers so far, Force is 1st, Hight was 5th, and Neff was 6th.
As of July 31, Force is 7th in the points standings, while teammate Mike Neff is leading, and Robert Hight is in second.

==2012==

2012 saw John welcome a fourth driver to his stable, former Top Alcohol Dragster champion, and daughter Courtney, who was in the running for the Auto Club Rookie of the Year Award, she will be driving the Traxxas Ford Mustang in her rookie season, and she has done something that only sister Ashley has done, beat her father in the first meeting between the two, taking John out of the Arizona Nationals in Phoenix in just the first round. Although Force was unable to retain the championship, finishing in fifth, he saw Courtney win something he never did, the NHRA Road to the Future Rookie of the Year award, and Courtney&#x27;s second-place finish in the season helped cement John Force Racing&#x27;s legacy for several years to come.

==2013==

During the start of the 2013 season, Ashley announced her retirement from full-time competition, this left the Force team short a driver. Rather than find another driver to take Ashley&#x27;s place within the Castrol GTX Funny Car, John did something he had never done before, field a Top Fuel car, with daughter Brittany behind the wheel. On July 26, 2013 it was announced that after the 2014 racing season Ford Motor Company would no longer be a part of John Force Racing. It was also announced that after the 2014 racing season, primary sponsor Castrol would be leaving JFR after a 29-year business relationship

During the penultimate race of the 2013 season, Force beat his daughter Courtney in the final round to win the race and his 16th NHRA Funny Car Championship.

==2014==

He won at the season opener in Pomona California as well wins in Norwalk Ohio &amp; Seattle Washington as he would finish 2nd points.

==2015==
In 2015 John announced a partnership with Chevrolet. He competed in the 2015 racing season with a new sponsorship deal from Peak Antifreeze.

==2016==
Debuted the new Chevrolet Camaro SS body in May at the Kansas Nationals in Topeka Kansas. John won four races during the 2016 season at The Mile High Nationals at Bandimere Colorado, The Sonoma Nationals in Sonoma California, The Toyota Nationals in LasVegas Nevada and The Carolina Nationals in Charlotte NC. Finished the season fourth in Funny Car Championship points.

==2017==
John&#x27;s daughter Brittany &amp; Robert Hight both won the championship in Top Fuel &amp; Funny Car respectively. Advance Auto Parts joined team, sponsoring Courtney Force and rest of JFR teams.

==2018==

Won at the Denver event for his only win of the season.

==2019==
On August 4, 2019, John Force won his 150th race at the Magic Dry Organic Absorbent NHRA Northwest Nationals in Seattle, Washington, edging out Ron Capps and breaking a 25 race winless streak, having last won in Colorado the year prior, also against Capps. John expressed extreme relief after winning, his first words to the camera being obscenities (which NHRA had to censor, as the broadcast was on network television). Force was not present in the winners&#x27; circle, having ridden his pitbike to the stands to watch Austin Prock, a driver on his Top Fuel team and son of a Force Racing mechanic, win his first race and was still celebrating with fans while Prock was being interviewed.

Force further celebrated the 2019 season by winning the U. S. Nationals.

Daughter Courtney Force retired from driving.

==2020==
He was the runner-up at the season opener in Pomona California but after 2 events him &amp; his teams didn&#x27;t run again in the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic but would return in the following year.

==2021==
In his return after missing most of the previous year because of the COVID-19 pandemic he won 3 events. He won at the Charlotte 4 Wide, Epping, &amp; Topeka events. At Dallas for the first time since 2018 John Force was set on fire in a crash that echoed his win in 1996 where his Castrol car caught fire at this track.
==2022==
He gained a win of the season at the 4-Wide Nationals in Charlotte, NC.

==2023==
Force had a pair of runner-up finishes &amp; finished in the Top 10 in points once again.

==2024==
He won the Saturday Final at the Arizona Nationals in Chandler, AZ. The race was originally part of the Lucas Oil Winternationals in Pomona, CA that was abandoned after the semifinals, resulting in a double finals situation at Firebird Motorsports Park. Force won the first final on Saturday, while Austin Prock, his teammate and son of John Force Racing crew chief Jimmy Prock, won the Sunday final.

Force then doubled at New England Dragway in the first New England Nationals since 2022 (the 2023 race was rescheduled to Bristol the following week) by winning the Mission Foods Challenge for semifinalists at the previous round (Joliet) in defeating Blake Alexander on a holeshot that counts towards bonus points in the Countdown, then defeating Prock in the main elimination tournament&#x27;s final round for his 157th victory.

In June 2024, Force suffered a traumatic brain injury in a fiery crash at Virginia Motorsports Park after his engine exploded at the end of a run. Having been admitted into ICU, he is expected to recover.

<doc id="1064824" wikidata="Q840132" url="?curid=1064824" title="Chomérac">
<text>Chomérac (; ) is a commune in the Ardèche department in southern France.

It is located approximately 10 km away from both the Rhône valley to the east and Privas (capital of the department) to the west.

==Geography==
Chomérac is located on the eastern foothills of the Massif Central, away from the Rhône, in a large valley incised in cretaceous marls by the &quot;Payre&quot; and &quot;Vérone&quot; rivers, south east of the Jurassic limestone plateau of Les &quot;Grads&quot; and north of the Miocene basaltic plateau &quot;Les Coirons.&quot;

==History==
As a natural pathway from Rhône valley to the Massif Central mountains, Chomérac has been inhabited for a very long time. First settlements records are found in caves and date back from the Middle Paleolithic. There are also evidences for Roman settlements and artefacts in the village (tegulae, villa and Roman road).

Chomérac was severely affected by the French Wars of Religion. In 1621, the village belonged to the catholic &quot;Duke of Ventadour&quot;. Besieged, it was occupied by the Protestant &quot;Monsieur de Blacons&quot; on 14 October 1621. Alternately besieged by both parties, the stronghold changed side six times, up until the siege of 1628, when the Catholics decisively took over the village from the Huguenots. This position was beneficial in 1629, during the siege of Privas led by the king Louis XIII and the Cardinal Richelieu.

==Population==
==Economy==
Industry started early in Chomérac, thanks to silk manufacturers (up to 15 silk throwing mills in the 19th century) and the marble quarry, which delivers to the whole region and even abroad.

<text>Sulima is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Notable people using the symbol were Zawisza Czarny—a famous Polish knight—and the Sułkowski family.

== Etymology ==
According to Maria Kowalska Bobowski, the term comes from the personal name &quot;Sulima&quot;, or &quot;Sulim&quot;. From 1394, the latter term was present in the sources Sulima with erysipelas, undoubtedly a member of this family.

Wladyslaw Semkowicz derived the name of Sulima from the village of nest Sulimów in Wielkopolska Sulina, under Kleck in the district of Gniezno, parish Dębnica. Another village with a similar name, Sulimów (now Sulmów), was in the district of Sieradz, parish Goszczanów. It was recorded in written records until 1391. From Łęczyca, goods of different families of the arms known from a later period. From about 30 km in a straight line to Sieradz Ostrowska near Uniejów, the village associated with Sulimami already in 13th in.

Another theory suggests that Sulima derived from the family name Sulimów, or the kind of medieval polearms known as sulicy.

==Description==

The coat of arms consists of a shield split horizontally into two regions that are red and yellow. The bottom region is usually depicted as red, or blue in some cases, with three white stones and crosses adorning it. The top region is depicted as yellow—sometimes described as gold—or less commonly white—sometimes described as silver—adorned with the top half of a right-facing eagle with its wings pointing outwards. More ornate depictions of the coat of arms include various mantling, including a helmet on top of the shield with an additional eagle on the helmet.

Variations used by individual families may change the color scheme, use a different eagle, or otherwise incorporate the entire design as part of a larger coat of arms.

==History==

The earliest recorded uses of the Sulima coat of arms are found on three wax seals attached to documents from . One of them was owned by the curator of the collegiate church of St. Michael&#x27;s Castle, Francis. In its initial form, the coat of arms consisted of only the undivided shield, but its colors remain unknown.

Among several images of the seal from the 14th century, the seal of Stanisław Gamrat from Klimontów impressed under the act of Union of Horodło in 1413.

Around the same time, Zawisza Czarny used Sulima. Fighting with the Turks and performing various missions at the side of king Sigismund, he colored the eagle black in his coat of arms (a &quot;cognomen&quot; Czarny means &quot;black&quot; in Polish). Associated with the figure of Zawisza is also the first colored version of Sulima. It ended up in &quot;St. Christopher&#x27;s Fraternal Book on Arlberg in Tyrol&quot; (pol. &quot;Księga bracka św. Krzysztofa na Arlbergu w Tyrolu)&quot; as a donation to the fraternity for caring for travelers crossing the Alps. The arms of the eagle, the top field, and an added girdle on the eagle were silver. The bottom field was red with golden stones, with an arrangement of two stones, then one. Presumably, the Western illustrator was inspired by the eagles of Silesia (girdle and color), Germany (color) and Poland (color of the field).

In the 15th century, appearances of Sulima were featured in three Western rolls of arms. Among them is the Burgundian &quot;Armorial Toison d&#x27;Or&quot; by Jean Le Fèvre de Saint-Remy from around 1435. Armorial repeats the color scheme of &quot;Fraternal Book&quot;, but the upper field is thinner, coming closer to a third of the shield instead of the usual half. That version lacks any jewels, nor does it have any mantling. Two other Western armorials, &quot;Codex Bergshammar&quot; and &quot;Armorial Lycenich&quot; from the 1420s–1430s, scaled down the top field.

At the same time in Poland, images of Sulima already had a clear division between two fields. The seals of Władysław from Oporów and bishop of Wrocław demonstrated this design from 1435 to 1441. Similar patterns were also preserved at the castle in Oporów.

The decoration of the reliquary of St. Barbara from the years 1484–1493 has decorative fringes; the emblem is red, and the field is gold.

Subsequent elements of the full coat of arms next to labrów and jewel, appeared on the bell of the Dmosin. Dating back to 1,500 years, the foundation of a family member Oporowski occurred. This is the first presentation of Sulima Labrami and the jewel in Poland. Additionally, the helmet had a crown.

The first performance Sulima with a gold top field comes from the portrait of Peter Gamrat from the years 1541–1545. However, the top field is more like a head. Division two-pole and gold upper field shows while so-called &quot;Herbal Arsenalski&quot; from about 1535–1555. In addition, the stones are all silver. Although the silver tincture upper field appears in the 16th century, the tincture of gold became present in more coat of arms. Much of the merits of a new compendium of heraldic from 1584—&quot;Herby rycerstwa polskiego&quot; by Bartosz Paprocki. It shows the image of the coat of arms full, but does not identify the color of stones. In addition, due to an engraver&#x27;s error, the eagle jewel and emblem is facing to the left, which was later replicated.

This coat of arms is found on several gothic tombstones, among others in Gniezno and Koło, as an architectural detail in several churches and in a castle in Oporów near Kutno, as well as a symbol of the founders of the various ecclesiastical jewels, precious chalices, and books.

The decline of the 14th century had the first written mention of Sulima. In 1397, the name of the family and the coat of arms appeared in court records Łęczyca voivodeship (record &quot;de cleynodio Sulima&quot;). In that same year, it mensions of a kindred Sulimów in court records Konin. Since then, it was translated in various writings heraldic, sometimes with a terse description of the coat of arms in Latin or Polish, for example, &quot;Pol Horla and trzi kamene&quot; (1423), &quot;eagle with three stones &quot;(1568), or &quot;three stones s pools eagle v black box&quot; (1580).

Sulima was also the first Polish armorial Gem attributed to Jan Długosz during the 1460s. Dlugosz describes the coat of arms without the distribution of the field. It is possible that it was omitted from this description, or based on older depictions.

The earliest mention of &quot;proklamie&quot;, another name for the coat of arms, comes from 1424.

The black eagle was a symbol of strength and the emblem of the Roman emperors as well as the Germans.

According to legend, given by Leopold von Ledebur progenitor, Sulimitów was added to the coat of arms of three precious stones to show the community of blood with his two brothers, from whom he had to distinguish by name and emblem.

Jan Dlugosz hypothesized, repeated later by other heralds (Paprocki, Bielski, Okolski, Niesiecki), that Sulimczycy were knights migrated from Germany. This would testify about the black eagle, allegedly referring to the heraldry of kings and emperors of the Reich. Niesiecki even gives an example of Prussian family Slomff that in one of the fields, the czterodzielnego coat of arms had half a black eagle and writes about them as relatives to Sulimczyków. &quot;Criterion imino&quot; clearly shows that the names of the earliest mentioned Sulimitów were purely Polish (e.g. Strzeszko, Budzisław, Wierzchosław).

Some of the common names there are for families of assumed to coat the road adoption. The first (not counting Rodywiła) documented an adopted (year 1506) was a councilor Jan Baytel (Beutel) of Toruń. In 1522, Sulimitą became Stanislaw Vitreator (Glazier - Szklarzewski), while four years later, Fedor Dawiłowicz of Vitsyebsk, children, and brothers—Saul Emanuel and Jerzy Zylajewiczami. They were adopted by Peter and John Służewski Gamrat. With the adoption came a coat of Felix of Trynczy in 1540, and it made the gem varieties (see variant versions aristocratic and alternative representations of the coat of arms). New Sulimitów admitted to the family until the end of the First Republic. Anthony, Christopher, and Valentine Deymów were knighted and given Sulima in 1768, George Trublajewicza a year later, and Melchior, Gaspar, and John Szajowskich (Szajewskich) in 1776.

Several families of foreign origin used Sulima, including Tatar and Armenian.

Stanislaw Dziadulewicz lists Tartar origin family kniaziowską Ułanowiczów (who have come from Jasiek Kazkowicza, an older line of princes Kryczyńskich; name comes from the village Ułanowicze taken in the period 1640–1650 Adam). He mentioned that in 1819, Ignatius Ułanowicz Sulima (who wrote the Ullanowicz and using the nickname &quot;on Solms&quot;) filed an application to the Senate of the Polish Kingdom to grant him the title of earl because of his father in various transactions, the official took the title and that was registered even in metric as Count. The Commission of the Senate in 1824 recognized the evidence and awarded it. The Zablocki family name is of Tatar origin, and lists the service &quot;Tartars Polish&quot;.

Louis Corvinus, of Armenian origin, was supposed to be part of the Jaśkiewiczów family. With this family were to be among others: Jan, court physician of King Stanisław August Poniatowski, Jagiellonian University professor; Joseph, the judge rights of Armenian in Lviv 1765, king&#x27;s secretary; Gabriel and Francis Xavier, secretaries of the king.

Published in 1855, a book of Russian heraldry Alexander Borisovich varnish &quot;Heraldry Russian&quot;. The author cites the names there of the Russian nobility, which took over some of the Polish coat of arms. Among them is Sulima. The paint does not explain how such a takeover occurred. What is certain is that few Polish families settled in Russia. Native Russian families could receive the Polish coats of arms on the principle of assimilation images of their own. Sulima had the varnish to seal the family: Bantysz-Kamienski, Guriew and Sabłukow (of unspecified variety). Herb Sulima, one of the 271 Polish nobility coats of arms, has been absorbed by the Russian heraldry.

<text>The North Carolina State Board of Education, established by Article 9 of the Constitution of North Carolina, supervises and administers the public school systems of North Carolina. The board sets policy and general procedures for public school systems across the state, including teacher pay and qualifications, course content, testing requirements, and manages state education funds.

The North Carolina State Board of Education consists of the Lieutenant Governor, State Treasurer, and 11 members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the General Assembly for eight-year terms (three at-large, eight from designated educational districts across the state). The North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction serves as the board&#x27;s secretary. In 2009, Gov. Beverly Perdue asked the board &quot;to redefine the duties of its chair to include the responsibilities of the newly created Chief Executive Officer, who will manage operations of the public school system.&quot; Superintendent June Atkinson sued the governor and the judge ruled that the superintendent had the constitutional authority to run the system.

== History ==

In 1868 North Carolina ratified a constitution which provided for a system of public schools to be led by a Superintendent of Public Instruction and a State Board of Education. Under this framework, the board comprised the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, superintendent of public works (an office eliminated in 1873), attorney general, and the superintendent of public instruction. It was tasked by the constitution to &quot;make all needful rules and regulations in relation to Free Public Schools and the Educational Fund of the State.&quot; In 1901 the legislature created an equalizing fund to subsidize education expenses in counties with fewer resources. The board was responsible for the fund until the duty of administering it was transferred to a new commission in 1927.

In 1943 the North Carolina General Assembly amended the constitution to modify the board&#x27;s membership to comprise the governor, lieutenant governor, state treasurer, superintendent, and a delegate from each of the state&#x27;s congressional districts. From 1943 to 1954, by informal arrangement, the lieutenant governor served as the board&#x27;s chairman. The new constitution of 1971 established that the board was to &quot;supervise and administer a free public school system and the educational funds provided for its support [...] and shall make all needed rules and regulations in relation, thereto&quot;. The document further revised the board&#x27;s membership to consist of the lieutenant governor, state treasurer, and 11 gubernatorial appointees (one from each of the state&#x27;s eight education districts and three others). The superintendent was removed from the board and made its chief administrator and secretary.

<doc id="1064839" wikidata="Q1143503" url="?curid=1064839" title="Bose gas">
<text>An ideal Bose gas is a quantum-mechanical phase of matter, analogous to a classical ideal gas. It is composed of bosons, which have an integer value of spin and abide by Bose–Einstein statistics. The statistical mechanics of bosons were developed by Satyendra Nath Bose for a photon gas and extended to massive particles by Albert Einstein, who realized that an ideal gas of bosons would form a condensate at a low enough temperature, unlike a classical ideal gas. This condensate is known as a Bose–Einstein condensate.

== Introduction and examples ==
Bosons are quantum mechanical particles that follow Bose–Einstein statistics, or equivalently, that possess integer spin. These particles can be classified as elementary: these are the Higgs boson, the photon, the gluon, the W/Z and the hypothetical graviton; or composite like the atom of hydrogen, the atom of 16O, the nucleus of deuterium, mesons etc. Additionally, some quasiparticles in more complex systems can also be considered bosons like the plasmons (quanta of charge density waves).

The first model that treated a gas with several bosons, was the photon gas, a gas of photons, developed by Bose. This model leads to a better understanding of Planck&#x27;s law and the black-body radiation. The photon gas can be easily expanded to any kind of ensemble of massless non-interacting bosons. The &quot;phonon gas&quot;, also known as Debye model, is an example where the normal modes of vibration of the crystal lattice of a metal, can be treated as effective massless bosons. Peter Debye used the phonon gas model to explain the behaviour of heat capacity of metals at low temperature.

An interesting example of a Bose gas is an ensemble of helium-4 atoms. When a system of 4He atoms is cooled down to temperature near absolute zero, many quantum mechanical effects are present. Below 2.17 K, the ensemble starts to behave as a superfluid, a fluid with almost zero viscosity. The Bose gas is the most simple quantitative model that explains this phase transition. Mainly when a gas of bosons is cooled down, it forms a Bose–Einstein condensate, a state where a large number of bosons occupy the lowest energy, the ground state, and quantum effects are macroscopically visible like wave interference.

The theory of Bose-Einstein condensates and Bose gases can also explain some features of superconductivity where charge carriers couple in pairs (Cooper pairs) and behave like bosons. As a result, superconductors behave like having no electrical resistivity at low temperatures.

The equivalent model for half-integer particles (like electrons or helium-3 atoms), that follow Fermi–Dirac statistics, is called the Fermi gas (an ensemble of non-interacting fermions). At low enough particle number density and high temperature, both the Fermi gas and the Bose gas behave like a classical ideal gas.

== Macroscopic limit ==
The thermodynamics of an ideal Bose gas is best calculated using the grand canonical ensemble. The grand potential for a Bose gas is given by:
: formula_1
where each term in the sum corresponds to a particular single-particle energy level &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot;; &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number of states with energy &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot;; &quot;z&quot; is the absolute activity (or &quot;fugacity&quot;), which may also be expressed in terms of the chemical potential &quot;μ&quot; by defining:
: formula_2
and &quot;β&quot; defined as:
: formula_3
where &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature. All thermodynamic quantities may be derived from the grand potential and we will consider all thermodynamic quantities to be functions of only the three variables &quot;z&quot;, &quot;β&quot; (or &quot;T&quot;), and &quot;V&quot;. All partial derivatives are taken with respect to one of these three variables while the other two are held constant.

The permissible range of &quot;z&quot; is from negative infinity to +1, as any value beyond this would give an infinite number of particles to states with an energy level of 0 (it is assumed that the energy levels have been offset so that the lowest energy level is 0).

=== Macroscopic limit, result for uncondensed fraction ===

Following the procedure described in the gas in a box article, we can apply the Thomas–Fermi approximation, which assumes that the average energy is large compared to the energy difference between levels so that the above sum may be replaced by an integral. This replacement gives the macroscopic grand potential function formula_4, which is close to formula_5:
: formula_6

The degeneracy &quot;dg&quot; may be expressed for many different situations by the general formula:
: formula_7
where &quot;α&quot; is a constant, &quot;E&quot;c is a &quot;critical&quot; energy, and Γ is the gamma function. For example, for a massive Bose gas in a box, and the critical energy is given by:
: formula_8
where Λ is the thermal wavelength, and &quot;f&quot; is a degeneracy factor ( for simple spinless bosons). For a massive Bose gas in a harmonic trap we will have and the critical energy is given by:
: formula_9
where &quot;V&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) = &quot;mω&quot;2&quot;r&quot;2/2 is the harmonic potential. It is seen that &quot;E&quot;c is a function of volume only.

This integral expression for the grand potential evaluates to:
: formula_10
where Li&quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the polylogarithm function.

The problem with this continuum approximation for a Bose gas is that the ground state has been effectively ignored, giving a degeneracy of zero for zero energy. This inaccuracy becomes serious when dealing with the Bose–Einstein condensate and will be dealt with in the next sections. As will be seen, even at low temperatures the above result is still useful for accurately describing the thermodynamics of just the uncondensed portion of the gas.

=== Limit on number of particles in uncondensed phase, critical temperature ===

The total number of particles is found from the grand potential by
: formula_11

This increases monotonically with &quot;z&quot; (up to the maximum &quot;z&quot; = +1). The behaviour when approaching &quot;z&quot; = 1 is however crucially dependent on the value of &quot;α&quot; (i.e., dependent on whether the gas is 1D, 2D, 3D, whether it is in a flat or harmonic potential well).

For , the number of particles only increases up to a finite maximum value, i.e., &quot;N&quot;m is finite at :
: formula_12
where &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) is the Riemann zeta function (using ). Thus, for a fixed number of particles &quot;N&quot;m, the largest possible value that &quot;β&quot; can have is a critical value &quot;β&quot;c. This corresponds to a critical temperature , below which the Thomas–Fermi approximation breaks down (the continuum of states simply can no longer support this many particles, at lower temperatures). The above equation can be solved for the critical temperature:
: formula_13

For example, for the three-dimensional Bose gas in a box (formula_14 and using the above noted value of &quot;E&quot;c) we get:
: formula_15

For , there is no upper limit on the number of particles (&quot;N&quot;m diverges as &quot;z&quot; approaches 1), and thus for example for a gas in a one- or two-dimensional box ( and respectively) there is no critical temperature.

=== Inclusion of the ground state ===

The above problem raises the question for : if a Bose gas with a fixed number of particles is lowered down below the critical temperature, what happens?
The problem here is that the Thomas–Fermi approximation has set the degeneracy of the ground state to zero, which is wrong. There is no ground state to accept the condensate and so particles simply &#x27;disappear&#x27; from the continuum of states. It turns out, however, that the macroscopic equation gives an accurate estimate of the number of particles in the excited states, and it is not a bad approximation to simply &quot;tack on&quot; a ground state term to accept the particles that fall out of the continuum:
: formula_16
where &quot;N&quot;0 is the number of particles in the ground state condensate.

Thus in the macroscopic limit, when , the value of &quot;z&quot; is pinned to 1 and &quot;N&quot;0 takes up the remainder of particles. For there is the normal behaviour, with . This approach gives the fraction of condensed particles in the macroscopic limit:
: formula_17

=== Limitations of the macroscopic Bose gas model ===

The above standard treatment of a macroscopic Bose gas is straightforward, but the inclusion of the ground state is somewhat inelegant. Another approach is to include the ground state explicitly (contributing a term in the grand potential, as in the section below), this gives rise to an unrealistic fluctuation catastrophe: the number of particles in any given state follow a geometric distribution, meaning that when condensation happens at and most particles are in one state, there is a huge uncertainty in the total number of particles. This is related to the fact that the compressibility becomes unbounded for . Calculations can instead be performed in the canonical ensemble, which fixes the total particle number, however the calculations are not as easy.

Practically however, the aforementioned theoretical flaw is a minor issue, as the most unrealistic assumption is that of non-interaction between bosons. Experimental realizations of boson gases always have significant interactions, i.e., they are non-ideal gases. The interactions significantly change the physics of how a condensate of bosons behaves: the ground state spreads out, the chemical potential saturates to a positive value even at zero temperature, and the fluctuation problem disappears (the compressibility becomes finite). See the article Bose–Einstein condensate.

== Approximate behaviour in small gases ==

For smaller, mesoscopic, systems (for example, with only thousands of particles), the ground state term can be more explicitly approximated by adding in an actual discrete level at energy &quot;ε&quot;=0 in the grand potential:
: formula_18
which gives instead . Now, the behaviour is smooth when crossing the critical temperature, and &quot;z&quot; approaches 1 very closely but does not reach it.

This can now be solved down to absolute zero in temperature. Figure 1 shows the results of the solution to this equation for , with , which corresponds to a gas of bosons in a box. The solid black line is the fraction of excited states for and the dotted black line is the solution for . The blue lines are the fraction of condensed particles &quot;N&quot;0/&quot;N&quot;. The red lines plot values of the negative of the chemical potential &quot;μ&quot; and the green lines plot the corresponding values of &quot;z&quot;. The horizontal axis is the normalized temperature &quot;τ&quot; defined by
: formula_19

It can be seen that each of these parameters become linear in &quot;τ&quot;&quot;α&quot; in the limit of low temperature and, except for the chemical potential, linear in 1/&quot;τ&quot;&quot;α&quot; in the limit of high temperature. As the number of particles increases, the condensed and excited fractions tend towards a discontinuity at the critical temperature.

The equation for the number of particles can be written in terms of the normalized temperature as:
: formula_20

For a given &quot;N&quot; and &quot;τ&quot;, this equation can be solved for &quot;τα&quot; and then a series solution for &quot;z&quot; can be found by the method of inversion of series, either in powers of &quot;τ&quot;&quot;α&quot; or as an asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of &quot;τα&quot;. From these expansions, we can find the behavior of the gas near and in the Maxwell–Boltzmann as &quot;T&quot; approaches infinity. In particular, we are interested in the limit as &quot;N&quot; approaches infinity, which can be easily determined from these expansions.

This approach to modelling small systems may in fact be unrealistic, however, since the variance in the number of particles in the ground state is very large, equal to the number of particles. In contrast, the variance of particle number in a normal gas is only the square-root of the particle number, which is why it can normally be ignored. This high variance is due to the choice of using the grand canonical ensemble for the entire system, including the condensate state.

=== Thermodynamics ===

Expanded out, the grand potential is:
: formula_21

All thermodynamic properties can be computed from this potential. The following table lists various thermodynamic quantities calculated in the limit of low temperature and high temperature, and in the limit of infinite particle number. An equal sign (=) indicates an exact result, while an approximation symbol indicates that only the first few terms of a series in formula_22 is shown.

It is seen that all quantities approach the values for a classical ideal gas in
the limit of large temperature. The above values can be used to calculate other
thermodynamic quantities. For example, the relationship between internal energy and
the product of pressure and volume is the same as that for a classical ideal gas over
all temperatures:
: formula_23

A similar situation holds for the specific heat at constant volume
: formula_24

The entropy is given by:
: formula_25

Note that in the limit of high temperature, we have
: formula_26
which, for &quot;α&quot; = 3/2 is simply a restatement of the Sackur–Tetrode equation. In one dimension bosons with delta interaction behave as fermions, they obey Pauli exclusion principle. In one dimension Bose gas with delta interaction can be solved exactly by Bethe ansatz. The bulk free energy and thermodynamic potentials were calculated by Chen-Ning Yang. In one dimensional case correlation functions also were evaluated. In one dimension Bose gas is equivalent to quantum non-linear Schrödinger equation.

<text>The Fir Domnann were a people named in Irish legendary history.

The name &quot;Fir Domnann&quot; is based on the root &quot;dumno&quot;-, which means both &#x27;deep&#x27; and &#x27;the world&#x27;. The suffix -&quot;on&quot;- often occurs in Gaulish and British divine names. The tribal name Dumnonii, found in Britain, would therefore mean &#x27;people of the god of the world&#x27;. Old Irish &quot;fir&quot; means &#x27;men&#x27;, and so &quot;Fir Domnann&quot; had the same meaning as the British tribal name, leading to conjecture that these tribes had a common origin. For example, O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s historical model proposed that the Domnann were a P-Celtic, pre-Goidelic people who, along with the Galeóin, invaded the south-east coast of Ireland from Britain. O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s theory of P-Celtic preceding Goidelic in Ireland is not widely accepted by experts today, but the idea of some connection between the British and Irish tribes of similar names remains.

In early Irish literature, the Fir Domnann were located in &quot;Cóice Laigean&quot; (Leinster). A probably 7th-century Irish poem credits their ruler, Mess-Telmann, with the over-kingship of the province and with wielding power from the royal site of Leinster at Dún Áilinne. The place-name Inber Domnann, now Malahide Bay inlet in north County Dublin on the east coast of Ireland, preserves the tribal name. Yet the area with the strongest placename associations with the Fir Domnann is in north-west Mayo: the Iorrais Domnann, from which the historical barony of Erris takes its name, and the nearby Mag Domnann and Dún Domnann.

<text>A Turncoat, also known as a Turncloak, is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another, betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party. In political and social history, this is distinct from being a traitor, as the switch mostly takes place under the following circumstances:
*In groups, often driven by one or more leaders.
*When the goal that formerly motivated and benefited the person becomes (or is perceived as having become) either no longer feasible or too costly even if success is achieved.

From a military perspective, opposing armies generally wear uniforms of contrasting colors to prevent incidents of friendly fire. Thus the term &quot;turn-coat&quot; indicates that an individual has changed sides and his uniform coat to one matching the color of his former enemy. For example, in the English Civil War during the 17th century, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers turned their coats inside out to match the colors of the Royal army (see &quot;Examples&quot; below).

==Historical context==
Even in a modern historical context &quot;turncoat&quot; is often synonymous with the term &quot;&quot;, a term of religious origins having its origins in the Latin word &quot;renegare&quot; (to deny). Historical currents of great magnitude have periodically caught masses of people, along with their leaders, in their wake. In such a dire situation, new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal treason becomes muddled. One example would be the situation that led to the Act of Abjuration or &quot;Plakkaat van Verlatinghe&quot;, signed on July 26, 1581, in the Netherlands, an instance where changing sides was given a positive meaning.

The first written use of the term meaning was by J. Foxe in &quot;Actes &amp; Monuments&quot; in 1570: &quot;One who changes his principles or party; a renegade; an apostate.&quot; Cited 1571*

&quot;Turncoat&quot; could also have a more literal origin. According to the Rotuli Chartarum 1199–1216 two barons changed fealty from William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, to King John. In other words, they turned their coats (of arms) from one lord to another, hence turncoat.

==Process==
A mass-shift in allegiance by a population may take place during military occupation, after a nation has been defeated in war or after a major social upheaval, such as a revolution. Following the initial traumatic times, many of the citizens of the area in question quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system. This shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one. In the face of fear and insecurity, the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival.

Often the leaders are the first to change loyalties, for they have had access to privileged information and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in dictatorships and authoritarian states when most of the population has been fed propaganda and triumphalism and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.

==Aftermath==
As time goes by, along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of burying and rewriting the past by concealing evidence. The fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat. The past is rewritten and whitewashed to cover former deeds. When successful, this activity results in the distortion and falsification of historical events.

Even after the death of a turncoat his family and friends may wish to keep uncomfortable secrets from the past out of the light. There is a fear of loss of prestige as well as a wish to honor the memory of a family member from the part of those who have experienced the positive side of the person.

In certain countries, individuals and organizations have actively investigated the past to bring turncoats to justice to face their responsibilities.

== Examples ==
There were many turncoats in history, including:

*The English Civil War during the 17th century. The siege of Corfe Castle was won by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers when they turned their coats inside out to match the colors of the Royal army.
*During the revolution of the British American colonies when U.S. Continental Army Major General Benedict Arnold defected to the side of the British in May 1779.
*Canada during the War of 1812. Some Canadians felt republicanism was a better system of government than the constitutional British monarchy and fought on the side of the invading Americans. 
*Germany and Austria after World War II when many former enthusiastic members of the Nazi Party embraced the newly created nations of West Germany or East Germany and sought to erase or at least minimize their former role as Nazis. During the decades that followed, many former Nazis regained prestige and held high posts in the new republics. Kurt Waldheim, an Austrian Nazi, even held the highest post as Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981 and as President of Austria from 1986 to 1992.
*France after the downfall of the Vichy Regime, when many collaborationists, whether home-grown fascists or Nazi sympathizers, played down their role in the former government and its institutions.
*Russia and the former Communist Eastern European countries after the fall of the USSR, where many former communists suddenly became fervent supporters of capitalism. As a result, many former apparatchiks abandoned the Communist Party in favor of positions in the new government structures.
*In Spain after the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and again during the Spanish transition to democracy (1975 onwards).
* In Syria, right after the fall of the Assad regime on 12/8/2024, many of his supporters (Shabiha) turned against him and began voicing support for the revolution. Just days before his escape, they were calling for bombs to be dropped on rebel-controlled areas.

<text>Gryf (Polish for &quot;Griffin&quot;), also known as Jaxa, is a Polish coat of arms that was used by many noble families in medieval Poland and later under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, branches of the original medieval Gryfita-Świebodzic family as well as families connected with the Clan by adoption at ennoblement or even by error.

==History==

===Legend===
Leszek III, legendary Prince of Poland, 805?, had 14 sons, of whom the oldest was Popiel I his successor to the throne. Leszek assured special parts of the realm to the remaining sons within his lifetime, obligating them by oath not to make the sovereignty of Popiel contentious. This ensured the safety and liberty of the country with a united army. 
*The other sons:
* &quot;Barnim&quot; and &quot;Bogdal&quot; kept the principality of Pomerania.
*&quot;Kazimierz&quot; and &quot;Władysław&quot;, the principality of Kashubia
*&quot;Vratislav&quot;, the island Rügen, with &quot;Przybysław&quot;.
*&quot;Cieszymierz&quot; and &quot;Otto&quot;, the Lusatia (Łużyce),
*&quot;Ziemowit&quot; and &quot;Zemornyst&quot;, the land of Brandenburg (Brenna &amp; Stodorania).
*&quot;Jaxa&quot; with another brother, the Meissen county (Miśnia), in Lusatia (Łużyce)

All these sons united under one war flag given by Leszek. The Lechites originally had a young lion on its war flag, then around 550, the white eagle appeared as a realm flag. The combination of both animal pictures into one figure has developed. Hence a lion&#x27;s body and an eagle&#x27;s head, which appears on and above the Gryf shield.

<text>Parc Astérix is a theme park in France based on the comic book series &quot;Asterix&quot; by Albert Uderzo and René Goscinny. In 2023, the park welcomed over 2.8 million visitors, making it the 2nd most visited park in France behind Disneyland Paris and the 8th most visited park in Europe.

It is especially renowned in France for its large variety of roller coasters, which exceeds the amount of most other parks in mainland France. Park Astérix has begun incorporating rides and themes from historic cultures like the Gauls, the Romans, Ancient Greece and recently Ancient Egypt, but always in the visual style of the related comic books, and most usually reusing characters, scenes and sounds from the Astérix media. The park is located approximately north of Paris, from Disneyland Paris and from the historic Château de Chantilly, in the commune of Plailly, in the department of Oise. Opened in 1989, the park is operated by Compagnie des Alpes and located right by the A1 motorway (Paris ↔ Lille ↔ Brussels), having its own highway exit and interchange.

==History==
===Conception and inauguration===

Largely funded by the Barclays financial company, with 20 other investors including Compagnie Générale des Eaux, the Havas group, Union des Assurances de Paris and the Picardy region, the park cost 850 million French francs to build and generated 1,200 jobs. The location was chosen due to the transport network: a private interchange connects it with the nearby A1 autoroute and a bus shuttle service connects it with Paris Métro Line 7 at La Courneuve&#x27;s 8 Mai 1945 station. Jack Lang, then Minister of Culture, inaugurated the park on 30 April 1989 after two years of work.

The opening of Disneyland Paris in 1992 caused Parc Astérix&#x27;s attendance to fall 30% and its revenue by 19%. However, attendance soon stabilised to around 2 million visitors per year.

===Recent developments===
In October 2005, Parc Astérix ran &quot;La Fête des Druides&quot; (&quot;The Festival of the Druids&quot;), as a way of &quot;thumbing their noses&quot; at Halloween. Season 2007 saw the Parc Astérix opening for the first time during the Christmas holidays. In 2009, for the park&#x27;s 20th anniversary, it opened during the weekends in September and October and ran a Halloween event called &quot;Peur sur le Parc Astérix&quot; (&quot;Fear at Parc Astérix&quot;). In May 2018, the park&#x27;s then Head of Construction, Thomas Dubosc, announced on television the construction of &quot;Toutatis&quot;, a new multi-launch roller coaster manufactured by Intamin, scheduled to be opened in 2021 yet only opened for season 2023 due to COVID-19 and woodcutting delays. In January 2021, the park announced it was closing its dolphin and sea lion enclosure, the &quot;Delphinarium&quot;, in order to focus on rides and other shows.

==Incidents==
* In July 2004, an 11-year-old boy was hit by lightning at the foot of the &quot;Trace du Hourra&quot; bobsleigh, despite 3 lightning rods located less than 20m from him. The park had continued operating despite weather warnings.
* On 5 July 2006, a 6-year-old Belgian child drowned on the &quot;Descente du Styx&quot; river rapids ride, sucked in by the water pumps used to create the flow in the bottom of the ride&#x27;s canal. The ride underwent various security measures; it was renamed to &quot;Romus et Rapidus&quot; in order to cast off the bad memory and unfortunate implications of the tragic accident. In Greek and Roman mythologies, the Styx is the river of the Underworld that has to be crossed by the dead.

<doc id="1064863" wikidata="Q173476" url="?curid=1064863" title="Cummins">
<text>Cummins Inc. is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. Cummins also services engines and related equipment, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission control, electrical power generation systems, and trucks.

Headquartered in Columbus, Indiana, Cummins sells in approximately 190 countries and territories through a network of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributors and approximately 7,200 dealers.

== History ==

The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana on February 3, 1919, by mechanic Clessie Cummins and banker William Glanton Irwin. The company focused on developing the diesel engine, which was invented 20 years earlier. Despite several well-publicized endurance trials, it was not until 1933 that their Model H engine, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful. The Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader in the post-World War II road-building boom in the United States, with more than half of the heavy-duty truck market using Cummins engines from 1952 to 1959. In the 1960s, the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland (closed in 1996). By 2013, Cummins had operations in 197 countries and territories.
== Business units ==
=== Cummins Components Business ===
Cummins Component Business Unit consists of emission solutions, filtration (Fleetguard), fuel systems, turbo technologies (Holset), and electronics. The Cummins Turbo Technologies unit designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. Its Emission Solutions unit develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and associated products to the medium and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. Cummins Filtration designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. In contrast Cummins Electronics designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.

=== Cummins Engine Business ===
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of aftermarket support, mid-range, heavy-duty, and high-power engines. Its markets include heavy and medium-duty trucks, buses, recreational vehicles (RV), light-duty automotive, and several industrial uses, including construction, mining, marine, oil, gas, railroad and military equipment.

One of the most popular engines built is the 5.9-liter I6 engine used in the Dodge Ram heavy-duty pickups starting in 1988. In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight-six engine became optional on the RAM pickup. In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class-action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block. The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.

In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to ship large natural gas-fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.

Cummins has a technical center in Darlington, England, for developing products for the European, Middle Eastern, and Asian markets.

=== Cummins Distribution Business ===
Cummins Distribution Business consists of engine and power generation distribution as well as service and parts. The distribution unit of Cummins consists of 17 Cummins owned distributors and 10 joint ventures, covering 90 countries and territories through 234 locations.

=== Cummins Power Systems Business ===

Cummins Power Systems Business Unit consists of alternators, automatic transfer switches, commercial power systems, consumer systems, engines, and paralleling systems. 

All of the above stem from the Cummins Onan Corporation, whose products remain in service today.

This Business Unit was formed recently, following a merge of the Power Generation Unit and High Horsepower Sub-Division. 

On August 22, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired all mobile power generation assets from Cummins. To maintain fleet and customer service continuity, some Cummins employees joined United Rentals.

=== Accelera by Cummins ===
On March 8, 2023, Cummins rebranded its New Power business unit as Accelera by Cummins. Accelera provides zero-emissions solutions including hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, e-axles, traction systems and electrolyzers.

== Subsidiaries==
=== Cummins Turbo Technologies ===

The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy-duty applications.

In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.

=== Cummins Power Systems ===

In 1986, Cummins began the acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation (now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly-invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.

Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) announced that it will be unifying its brand strategy across its Power Systems business segment, which provides high-speed engines from 760 – 4400 HP and power generation equipment from 2–3,500 kW, including standby and prime power gen sets, alternators, switchgear and other components. Currently, the portfolio features the Cummins, Cummins Power Generation and Cummins Onan brands. With immediate effect, the branding will be consolidated under the Cummins brand. The Cummins Power Generation and Cummins Onan brands will be retired and the Onan name synonymous with mobile gensets, will be repositioned as a generator product line under the newly unified Cummins brand in the RV market.

Cummins Inc. will also be permanently changing all “Fun Roads” branding to Cummins RV moving forward as well and the Fun Roads brand will also be retired. As Onan will now be repositioned as an RV product line, with the new rv.cummins.com website and social media platforms serving as tools for RVers across the country to find relevant information like product specs and a sales and service locator.

“Looking to unify Cummins into one cohesive, unified brand, we decided that consolidating both products (engines and generators) into the Cummins RV family only strengthens the brand and more uniformly speaks to our manufacturers and consumers,” said Jodie Wilson. “The brand changing will not affect product or service offerings, but will help us to continue on our promise of delivering dependability across the globe.”

Rebranding occurred globally on all marketing activities, as product branding changed across all manufacturing plants beginning July 2017.

President Joe Biden visited the Cummins plant in Fridley, Minnesota on April 3, 2022. It was part of his &quot;Investing in America&quot; tour. Cummins had announced a US$1 billion initiative to produce clean energy technology, including electrolyzers for hydrogen cells in Fridley.

=== Cummins Emission Solutions ===

Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division changed its name to &quot;Cummins Emission Solutions&quot; to be identified more closely with their parent company.

==China operations==
Cummins has some joint ventures with Chinese manufacturers, such as Dongfeng Cummins, a joint venture with Dongfeng Automobile Company, as well as Guangxi Cummins Industrial Power with LiuGong. One of the most successful joint ventures is the joint venture with Foton called Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company. This joint venture developed the ISG/X12 engine platform in the mid 2010s. The ISG/X12 in China has surpassed 240,000 units per year making it the highest volume heavy duty engine in the Cummins product line. The ISG/X12 is the foundation for all Cummins future engine platforms. 

Other entities were Cummins Beijing, Chongqing Cummins Engine, Xi’an Cummins Engine, Wuxi Newage Alternators, Xiangfan Fleetguard, Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies.

==India operations==
Cummins India is the Indian subsidiary of Cummins. Cummins India is publicly traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:
* Cummins - 50% 
* Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
* Retail Investors - 24.5%
In 1996 Cummins Inc. bought Kirloskar shares. Now it is a Cummins Inc. subsidiary. As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.

Cummins conducts a significant part of its R&amp;D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was established in 2003. Cummins has built a technical centre in Pune which houses over 2500 engineers, called CTCI (Cummins Technical Centre India).

Cummins India has made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS&#x27;s Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.

==Clean Air Act violations==
In 1998, the EPA announced fines totaling $83.4 million against Cummins and six other diesel engine manufacturers, the largest fine to date. The fines came after manufacturers evaded testing by deliberately deactivating emissions controls during highway driving to give the appearance of being in full regulatory compliance during standard laboratory testing. The manufacturers also agreed to spend more than $1 billion to correct the problem. The trucks used engine ECU software to engage pollution controls during the 20-minute lab tests to verify compliance with the Clean Air Act, but then quietly disabled the emissions controls during normal highway cruising, thereby emitting up to three times the maximum allowed NOx pollution.

In December 2023, Cummins was fined $1.675 billion by the U.S. Justice Department for violations of the Clean Air Act. Cummins was found to have installed devices designed to bypass or disable emissions controls on 960,000 Dodge and Stellantis RAM pickup truck diesel engines between 2013 and 2023. It will also pay $325 million in remedies and recalls.

==Carbon footprint==
Cummins reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 595 Kt (-94 /-13.7% y-o-y). The company plans to reduce total emissions (Direct + Indirect) 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year and also aims to reach net-zero by 2050.

<doc id="1064867" wikidata="Q214155" url="?curid=1064867" title="Mopti Region">
<text>Mopti (Fulfulde: 𞤁𞤭𞥅𞤱𞤢𞤤 𞤃𞤮𞥅𞤩𞤼𞤭𞥅, transliterated &quot;Diiwal Moobti&quot;) is the fifth administrative region of Mali, covering 79,017 km2. Its capital is the city of Mopti. During the 2012 Northern Mali conflict, the frontier between Southern Mali which is controlled by the central government and the rebel-held North ran through Mopti Region.

==Geography==
Mopti Region is bordered by Tombouctou Region to the north, Ségou Region to the southwest, and Burkina Faso to the southeast.

The population in the 2009 census was 2,037,330. The region contains a number of ethnic groups including Fulani, Malinke, and Bambara.

The Niger River crosses the region, and is joined by the Bani, an important tributary, at the city of Mopti.

The region is separated into several areas: the Inland Niger Delta around Mopti, the Bandiagara cliffs and the plain of Bankass along the Burkina Faso frontier. Mount Hombori, the highest point in Mali at 1153 meters, is in the Mopti Region, near the city of the same name.

In terms of its climate, Mopti Region is considered part of the Sahel.

The largest towns of the region are Mopti, Sévaré (which lies within Mopti Commune), Djenné, Bandiagara, Bankass, Douentza, and Youwarou.

==Transportation and economy==
An airport at Mopti provides air service for the region, while the Niger River provides transportation to Koulikoro and Ségou to the west and Tombouctou and Gao to the east.

The region is well-irrigated and its agriculture is well-developed, with particularly successful fishing. Mopti serves as an important commercial crossroads between Mali&#x27;s north, south and bordering nations. Tourism is also well-developed, notably in the cities of Djenné and Mopti (the former of which boasts the Great Mosque of Djenné, the largest mud structure in the world) and in Dogon country.

==History==
Though Mopti&#x27;s location, once a Bozo village named Sanga, had long been inhabited, rapid expansion began under Seku Amadu&#x27;s Massina Empire around 1820. Expansion continued under the Toucouleur Empire of El Hadj Umar Tall as well as the French colonial administration.

== Culture ==
The region is a melting pot, made up of various ethnic groups which live in harmony with one another. Common languages of the area include Fulani, Dogon, Songhai, Bozo, Bambara and Tamashek.

Both the city of Djenné and the Bandiagara Escarpment have been named World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

==Administrative subdivisions==

Mopti is divided into 8 &quot;Cercles&quot; encompassing 108 communes:

There are more than 1,000 villages in Mopti Region occupied by ethnic Dogon, Songhay, Fula, and other peoples.

<text>Federico Jorge Jiménez Losantos (born 15 September 1951), also known by his initials FJL, is a Spanish radio presenter and right-wing pundit, being most known for his successful radio talk show &quot;Es la mañana de Federico&quot;. He is also a TV host and literary and non-fiction author. A member of extreme-left organizations and participant in Barcelona&#x27;s counter-cultural scene in the 1970s, he experienced a radical rightward drift, eventually becoming a journalistic guru for a right-wing audience.

==Early life==
Born in Orihuela del Tremedal, Teruel, on 15 September 1951, to a family of educators. He studied at a high school in Teruel, where he was a student of José Antonio Labordeta (who reportedly considered Losantos &quot;like a son&quot; at the time and later wondered about his personal &quot;transformation&quot;) and José Sanchis Sinisterra. He was a resident at Colegio Menor &quot;San Pablo&quot;, and earned a silver medal of Student Merit and the third class of the &quot;Colegio Pizarro&quot; literary award.

Jiménez Losantos arrived to Barcelona at age 20, and he studied Philosophy and Letters (section Romance Philology) at the University of Barcelona, earning a licentiate degree by reading a dissertation about Valle Inclán. He was a member of Bandera Roja and the PSUC during his spell in Barcelona. Disenchanted as result of a journey to Maoist China and the reading of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, he distanced himself from communism in 1976.

Together with Alberto Cardín, he founded &quot; Revista de Literatura&quot; (1974)—the &quot;most Lacanian&quot; publication at the time in Spain— and &quot;Diwan&quot; (1978).

Literature and language teacher at a high school in Santa Coloma de Gramanet and one of the promoters of the so-called denouncing the alleged &quot;intention to make Catalan the only official language of Catalonia&quot;, he was kidnapped by Terra Lliure in 1981; after being gagged and shot at the leg by in a wasteland in Esplugues de Llobregat, Losantos was left abandoned and tied to a tree by the kidnappers.

He left Catalonia and moved to Madrid after the attack. He worked as a literature teacher at the Instituto Lope de Vega high school in the Spanish capital.

==Career in journalism==
He was hired as Op-Ed Editor of the &quot;Diario 16&quot; newspaper. He then worked for Antena 3 Radio, and later for the COPE radio network of the Spanish Catholic church. After a year in Miami, he returned to Spain and took charge of La Linterna, a night programme on COPE radio. In 2003 he became director of &quot;La Mañana&quot;, also on COPE, and became increasingly popular in the morning radio. With &quot;La Mañana&quot; he became one of the most listened-to radio talk show hosts in Spain until he parted ways in July 2009.

He was one of the founders of &quot;La Ilustración Liberal&quot; magazine.

In 2000, together with the likes of Javier Rubio Navarro, José María Marco, Alberto Recarte, Carlos Rodríguez Braun and Pedro Schwartz, Losantos helped to create &quot;Libertad Digital&quot;, a markedly partisan right-leaning and anti-socialist online newspaper. Half of the seed capital was provided by the Grupo Intereconomía.

He is also a regular columnist for &quot;El Mundo&quot; and has written several books, mostly on political topics. He also debuted in poetry with a book of haikus. In 2005 he started &#x27;The Spain Herald&#x27;, an English-language digest of articles from Libertad Digital which has been off-line since June 2006.

He has been successfully prosecuted on a number of occasions for defamatory pronouncements. Including a quarrel filed by Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, and being legally prompted, along with his employers COPE, to pay compensation of 60,000 euros to Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya.
In 2009, after the discomfort that Losantos&#x27; outspoken and uncompromising editorial line was creating in the COPE (deeply critical of the former Spanish premier Zapatero, but, somewhat surprisingly for Spain&#x27;s partisan politics, equally critical of the conservative opposition, which he chastises as being bland and lacking a real alternative project), he did not accept the new role he was offered by this radio station and announced he was moving, among others, to create his own radio station, esRadio, to be launched in September of that same year.

Losantos received the &quot;Antena de Oro&quot; award in 2022.

== Ideology and views ==

He was one of the figures from among the Conservative camp (along, for example, José María Aznar) who tried to vindicate the figure of Manuel Azaña in the mid 1990s, partially justified by the bad feelings of the republican politician towards the so-called &quot;peripheral nationalisms&quot;.

He has acrimoniously derided the left-wing political parties in Spain for an alleged renouncement to the &quot;idea of Spain&quot; and lack of State project. A harsh opponent of Catalan nationalism, he has decried language policy in Catalonia as a &quot;cultural genocide&quot;. He has fiercely criticised the cultural policies implemented by the regional administrations of the autonomous communities of Spain.

He was among the leading public figures promoting the conspiracy theory about the authorship of the 11-M terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004, and he even got to the point of purging critics of the conspiracy theory off from the informative services of COPE.

He endorsed Rosa Díez in the campaign for the 2011 general election.

He has declared to be an atheist.
In 2021, he had a row with the anti-vax movement whom he deemed as &quot;&quot; (roughly translating to &#x27;ultra-fuddy-duddy bleach drinkers&#x27;) and claimed that &quot;murderers&quot; are &quot;those who do not vaccinate their children and deny that vaccines save lives&quot;.

== Style ==
His style has been described as &quot;vehement and aggressive&quot;. He has been noted by his ability to create hurtful nicknames to deride his &quot;enemies&quot;. He regularly uses the stylistic device of relating the meteorological situation at a given time to the ongoing affairs in Spain.

<doc id="1064876" wikidata="Q1128390" url="?curid=1064876" title="Potter's wheel">
<text>In pottery, a potter&#x27;s wheel is a machine used in the shaping (known as throwing) of clay into round ceramic ware. The wheel may also be used during the process of trimming excess clay from leather-hard dried ware that is stiff but malleable, and for applying incised decoration or rings of colour. Use of the potter&#x27;s wheel became widespread throughout the Old World but was unknown in the Pre-Columbian New World, where pottery was handmade by methods that included coiling and beating.

A potter&#x27;s wheel may occasionally be referred to as a &quot;potter&#x27;s lathe&quot;. However, that term is better used for another kind of machine that is used for a different shaping process, turning, similar to that used for shaping of metal and wooden articles. The pottery wheel is an important component to create arts and craft products. 

The techniques of jiggering and jolleying can be seen as extensions of the potter&#x27;s wheel: in jiggering, a shaped tool is slowly brought down onto the plastic clay body that has been placed on top of the rotating plaster mould. The jigger tool shapes one face, the mould the other. The term is specific to the shaping of flat ware, such as plates, whilst a similar technique, jolleying, refers to the production of hollow ware, such as cups.

== History ==
Prior to using a wheel all of these civilizations used techniques such as pinching, coiling, paddling, and shaping to create ceramic forms. In addition, several of these techniques continued to be used on pots on or off the wheel to decorate or create more rounded or symmetrical shapes.

Most early ceramic ware was hand-built using a simple coiling technique in which clay was rolled into long threads that were then pinched and smoothed together to form the body of a vessel. In the coiling method of construction, all the energy required to form the main part of a piece is supplied indirectly by the hands of the potter. Early ceramics built by coiling were often placed on mats or large leaves to allow them to be worked more conveniently. The evidence of this lies in mat or leaf impressions left in the clay of the base of the pot. This arrangement allowed the potter to rotate the vessel during construction, rather than walk around it to add coils of clay.

The oldest forms of the potter&#x27;s wheel (called &quot;tourneys&quot; or &quot;slow wheels&quot;) were probably developed as an extension to this procedure. Tournettes, in use around 3500 BC in the Near East, were turned slowly by hand or by foot while coiling a pot. Only a small range of vessels were fashioned on the tournette, suggesting that it was used by a limited number of potters. The introduction of the slow wheel increased the efficiency of hand-powered pottery production.

In the mid to late 3rd millennium BC the &quot;fast wheel&quot; was developed, which operated on the flywheel principle. It utilised energy stored in the rotating mass of the heavy stone wheel itself to speed the process. This wheel was wound up and charged with energy by kicking, or pushing it around with a stick, providing angular momentum. The fast wheel enabled a new process of pottery-making to develop, called &quot;throwing&quot;, in which a lump of clay was placed centrally on the wheel and then squeezed, lifted and shaped as the wheel turned. The process tends to leave rings on the inside of the pot and can be used to create thinner-walled pieces and a wider variety of shapes, including stemmed vessels, so wheel-thrown pottery can be distinguished from handmade. Potters could now produce many more pots per hour, a first step towards industrialization. 

Many modern scholars suggest that the first potter&#x27;s wheel was first developed by the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia. A stone potter&#x27;s wheel found at the Sumerian city of Ur in modern-day Iraq has been dated to about 3129 BC, but fragments of wheel-thrown pottery of an even earlier date have been recovered in the same area. However, southeastern Europe and China have also been claimed as possible places of origin. A potter&#x27;s wheel in western Ukraine, from the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, has been dated to the middle of the 5th millennium BC, and is the oldest ever found, and which further precedes the earliest use of the potter&#x27;s wheel in Mesopotamia by several hundred years. On the other hand, Egypt is considered as &quot;being the place of origin of the potter&#x27;s wheel. It was here that the turntable shaft was lengthened about 3000 BC and a flywheel added. The flywheel was kicked and later was moved by pulling the edge with the left hand while forming the clay with the right. This led to the counterclockwise motion for the potter&#x27;s wheel which is almost universal.&quot; Thus, the exact origin of the wheel is not wholly clear yet.
In the Iron Age, the potter&#x27;s wheel in common use had a turning platform about over the floor, connected by a long axle to a heavy flywheel at ground level. This arrangement allowed the potter to keep the turning wheel rotating by kicking the flywheel with the foot, leaving both hands free for manipulating the vessel under construction. However, from an ergonomic standpoint, sweeping the foot from side to side against the spinning hub is rather awkward. At some point, an alternative solution was invented that involved a crankshaft with a lever that converted up-and-down motion into rotary motion.

In Japan the potter&#x27;s wheel first showed by in the Asuka or Sueki period (552–710 CE) where wares were more sophisticated and complicated. In addition to the new technology of the wheel, firing was also changed to a much higher temperature in a rudimentary kiln. The industrialization continued through the Nara period (710–794) and into the Heian, or Fujiwara, period (794–1185). With higher temperature firings, new glazes followed (green, yellowish brown, and white), in addition new styles and techniques of glazing emerged. 

Ceramic wares that emerged from China were processed with a very similar beginning as Japan. The history of Chinese pottery began in the Neolithic era about 4300 BC down to 2000 BC. Unlike Japan, which focused on production of everyday wares, China created mostly decorative pieces with few opportunities for industrialization and production of ceramic wares. Because China focused on decorative wares, most of their pottery was centered around porcelain instead of earthen wares seem almost everywhere else, and they used the potter&#x27;s wheel for the development of porcelain clay culture. Porcelain took off during the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), when the iconic blue and white porcelain ceramics emerged. Several places in China mix traditional elements and methods with modern design and technologies. 

Native Americans have been creating ceramics by hand and in more modern eras started incorporating a wheel into their work. Pottery can be identified in the Southwest of North American dating back to 150 CE and has been an important part of Native American culture for over 2,000 years. Historically Native Americans have been using the coiling method to achieve their decorative and functional pieces, and the technology to create an electric wheel did not show up until the arrival of Europeans. However, smaller turntables or slow wheels could have been used occasionally. 

The use of the motor-driven wheel has become common in modern times, particularly with craft potters and educational institutions, although human-powered ones are still in use and are preferred by some studio potters. 

== Industrialization ==

Social consequences that can arrive of these technological advancements include increased economic advancements in the sales of pottery created using the potter’s wheel and industrialization of the ceramics processes. The potter’s wheel greatly increased the production rate of ceramics, which allowed for more products to be created. With the industrialization of ceramics in Japan, ceramics also lost some of its historical value, and some techniques and meanings of the ceramics were lost in the process.

== Techniques of throwing ==

A skilled potter can quickly throw a vessel from up to of clay. Alternatively, by throwing a vessel and adding coils of clay then throwing again, pots may be made even taller, with the heat of a blowlamp being used to firm each thrown section before adding the next coil. Similarly, multiple sections may be thrown and combined to create large vessels. Large wheels and masses of clay can also allow for multiple people to work on a pot simultaneously, which can create very large ceramic pieces. This practice is used in Jingdezhen, China, where 3 or more potters may work on one pot at the same time. 

There are a variety of methods to throwing, though almost all involve the following steps in some form: center the clay on the wheel, open a hole in the clay, creating a donut shaped ring of clay around the base of the pot, then raise or shape the walls to create the pots final shape. The specifics of these steps, including the motions of the hands, can vary from culture to culture, as well as from potter to potter. In most cultures, the wheel spins counterclockwise and the right hand is placed on the outside of the pot as it is thrown. Japanese pottery is thrown oppositely, with the wheel spinning clockwise and the right hand on the interior of the pot. However, modern wheels powered by electric motors often allow for rotation in either direction, allowing the potter to choose which direction works best for their technique, hand dominance and personal preferences. 

== The potter&#x27;s wheel in myth ==
In Ancient Egyptian mythology, the deity Khnum was said to have formed the first humans on a potter&#x27;s wheel.

<text>John William &quot;Long John&quot; Baldry (12 January 1941 – 21 July 2005) was an English musician and actor. In the 1960s, he was one of the first British vocalists to sing the blues in clubs and shared the stage with many British musicians including the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. Before achieving stardom, Rod Stewart and Elton John were members of bands led by Baldry. He enjoyed pop success in 1967 when &quot;Let the Heartaches Begin&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK, and in Australia where his duet with Kathi McDonald, &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;, reached No. 2 in 1980.

Baldry lived in Canada from the late 1970s until his death, in which he continued to make records there. In the mid 1980s, he took up voiceover work. Two of his best-known voice roles were as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and KOMPLEX in &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Wars&quot;.

==Early life==
John William Baldry was born on 12 January 1941, at East Haddon Hall, East Haddon, Northamptonshire, which was serving as a makeshift wartime maternity ward, on 12 January 1941, the son of William James Baldry (1915–1990), a Metropolitan Police constable and his wife, Margaret Louisa (née Parker; 1915–1989); their usual address was recorded as 18 Frinton Road, East Ham. His early life was spent in Edgware, Middlesex, where he attended Camrose Primary School until the age of 11, after which he attended Downer Grammar School (now Canons High School).

==Blues bands of the 1960s==

Baldry grew to , resulting in the nickname &quot;Long John&quot;. He appeared quite regularly in the early 1960s in the Gyre &amp; Gimble coffee lounge, around the corner from Charing Cross railway station, and at the Bluesville R. &amp; B. Club, Manor House, London, also Klooks Kleek (Railway Hotel, West Hampstead). He appeared weekly for some years at Eel Pie Island on the Thames at Twickenham and also appeared at the Station Hotel in Richmond, one of the Rolling Stones&#x27; earliest venues.

In the early 1960s, he sang with Alexis Korner&#x27;s Blues Incorporated, with whom he recorded the first British blues album in 1962, &quot;R&amp;B from the Marquee&quot;. At stages, Mick Jagger, Jack Bruce and Charlie Watts were members of this band while Keith Richards and Brian Jones played on stage, although none played on the &quot;R&amp;B at the Marquee&quot; album. When the Rolling Stones made their debut at the Marquee Club in July 1962, Baldry put together a group to support them. Later, he was the announcer introducing the Stones on their United States-only live album &quot;Got Live If You Want It!&quot; in 1966.

Baldry became friendly with Paul McCartney after a show at the Cavern Club in Liverpool in the early 1960s, leading to an invitation to sing on one of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 television specials, &quot;Around The Beatles&quot;. In the special, Baldry performs &quot;Got My Mojo Workin&#x27;&quot; and a medley of songs with members of the Vernons Girls trio; in the latter, the Beatles are shown singing along in the audience.

In 1963, Baldry joined the Cyril Davies R&amp;B All Stars with Nicky Hopkins playing piano. He took over in 1964 after the death of Cyril Davies, and the group became Long John Baldry and his Hoochie Coochie Men featuring Rod Stewart on vocals and Geoff Bradford on guitar. Stewart was recruited when Baldry heard him busking a Muddy Waters song at Twickenham Station after Stewart had been to a Baldry gig at Eel Pie Island. Long John Baldry became a regular fixture on Sunday nights at Eel Pie Island from then onwards, fronting a series of bands.

In 1965, the Hoochie Coochie Men became Steampacket with Baldry and Stewart as male vocalists, Julie Driscoll as the female vocalist and Brian Auger on Hammond organ. After Steampacket broke up in 1966, Baldry formed Bluesology featuring Reg Dwight on keyboards and Elton Dean, later of Soft Machine, as well as Caleb Quaye on guitar. Dwight, when he began to record as a solo artist, adopted the name Elton John, his first name from Elton Dean and his surname from John Baldry.

Following the departure of Elton John and Bluesology, Baldry was left without a backup band. Attending a show in the Mecca at Shaftesbury Avenue, he saw a five-piece harmony group called Chimera from Plymouth, who had recently turned professional. He approached them after their set to tell them how impressed he was by their vocal harmonies and that they would be ideal to back him on the cabaret circuit he was currently embarking on, which they did.

==Solo artist==
In 1967, he recorded a pop song &quot;Let the Heartaches Begin&quot; that went to number one in Britain, followed by a 1968 top 20 hit titled &quot;Mexico&quot;, which was the theme of the UK Olympic team that year. &quot;Let the Heartaches Begin&quot; made the lower reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US. Baldry was still touring, doing gigs with Bluesology, but the band refused to back his rendition of &quot;Let the Heartaches Begin&quot;, and left the stage while he performed to a backing-tape played on a large Revox tape-recorder.

In 1971, John and Stewart each produced one side of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot; which became Baldry&#x27;s most popular album and made the top 100 of the US album chart. The album featured &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Lay No Boogie Woogie on the King of Rock and Roll&quot; which became his most successful song in the US. Baldry&#x27;s first tour of the US was at this time. The band included Micky Waller, Ian Armitt, Pete Sears, and Sammy Mitchell. Stewart and John would again co-produce his 1972 album &quot;Everything Stops For Tea&quot; which also made the lower reaches of the US album charts. The same year, Baldry worked with ex-Procol Harum guitarist Dave Ball. The 1979 album &quot;Baldry&#x27;s Out&quot; was recorded in Canada, which he released at Zolly&#x27;s Forum; a nightclub in Oshawa, underneath the Oshawa Shopping Centre.

In a 1997 interview with a German television programme, Baldry claimed to be the last person to see singer Marc Bolan before Bolan&#x27;s death on 16 September 1977, having conducted an interview with the fellow singer for an American production company, he says, just before Bolan was killed in a car accident.

==Move to Canada, later career==
After time in New York City and Los Angeles in 1978, Baldry lived in Dundas, Ontario from 1980 to 1984 before settling in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he became a Canadian citizen. He toured the west and east coasts as well as the United States northwest. 

In 1976, he teamed with Seattle singer Kathi McDonald, who became part of the Long John Baldry Band, touring Canada and the United States. In 1979 the pair recorded a version of the Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;, following which McDonald became part of his touring group for two decades. The song entered the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and was a No. 2 hit in Australia in 1980. &quot;(Walk Me Out In the) Morning Dew&quot;, a song from his 1980 &quot;Boys in the Band&quot; album, became a hit in the Netherlands in 1981.

He last recorded with the Stony Plain label. His 1997 album &quot;Right To Sing The Blues&quot; won a Juno Award in the Blues Album of the Year category at the Juno Awards of 1997.

In 2003, Baldry headlined the British Legends of Rhythm and Blues United Kingdom tour, alongside Zoot Money, Ray Dorset and Paul Williams. Baldry&#x27;s final United States performance was held at Barrister Hall in Columbus, Ohio, on 19 July 2004. Baldry&#x27;s final United Kingdom tour as the Long John Baldry Trio concluded with a performance on 13 November 2004 at The King&#x27;s Lynn Arts Centre, King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, England. The trio consisted of Baldry, Butch Coulter on harmonica and Dave Kelly on slide guitar.

==Personal life==
According to Giorgio Gomelsky, Baldry&#x27;s flamboyant mannerisms made his homosexuality an open secret within the music industry during the early 1960s; until 1967, male homosexual acts were unlawful in Britain, and so Baldry did not publicly disclose his orientation. Baldry had a brief relationship with Dave Davies of the Kinks.

In 1968, Elton John tried to take his own life after relationship problems with a woman, Linda Woodrow. His lyricist Bernie Taupin and Baldry found him, and Baldry talked him out of marrying her. The song &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; from &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; was about the experience.

In 1978, Baldry&#x27;s then-upcoming album &quot;Baldry&#x27;s Out&quot; announced his formal coming out, and he addressed sexuality problems with a cover of Canadian songwriter Barbra Amesbury&#x27;s &quot;A Thrill&#x27;s a Thrill&quot;.

===Health and death===
During the mid-1970s, Baldry suffered from depression exacerbated by his collapsing career (particularly the failure of his 1973 album &quot;Good to Be Alive&quot;) and separation from an Austrian boyfriend who was required to leave the United Kingdom when his visitor visa expired. As a result, he developed an addiction to alcohol and painkillers.

Following an incident in which he was allegedly mugged in Amsterdam, Baldry was found barely conscious by his sister, Margaret, in their Muswell Hill home, having overdosed on Valium and alcohol in an apparent suicide attempt. Baldry was institutionalised for less than a week, reportedly stopping his dependencies cold turkey.

By the release of his 1986 album &quot;Silent Treatment&quot;, Baldry suffered from crippling gout – which required several pairs of special shoes – as well as bronchial and sinus issues. Shortly after moving into a condominium on Vancouver&#x27;s 4th Avenue in 1995, Baldry was hospitalised and underwent surgery for a bleeding stomach ulcer. He quit smoking afterwards and ceased performing in clubs that allowed smoking. During a performance in Banbury promoting his 1999 live album &quot;Live, Long John Baldry Trio&quot;, Baldry was hospitalised for another bleeding ulcer caused and obscured by his arthritis medication indometacin. A few days after being discharged from Horton General Hospital, he developed agonising gout across his body, prompting Rod Stewart to admit him to the London Clinic, where he stayed for three weeks.

In 2002, Baldry remarked that he had developed spinal osteoporosis and dorsocervical lipodystrophy. He underwent hip replacement surgery to treat his osteoporosis, after which Tom Lavin of the Powder Blues Band noted that he appeared healthier.

Although he had ceased smoking, Baldry developed a persistent hacking cough and chronic wheezing by late 2004; according to Felix &quot;Oz&quot; Rexach, Baldry&#x27;s partner of 25 years, he had fallen ill with pneumonia after returning from a European tour earlier that year. Baldry held a phobia of hospitals, fearing that he would &quot;never come out&quot;, and so resisted Rexach&#x27;s attempts to get him medical attention. After becoming too ill to endure, he was finally admitted to a hospital in March 2005, and was moved to a rehabilitation clinic two weeks later, where Rod Stewart visited him. In early April, his condition deteriorated and he was moved to an intensive care unit, where he was fitted with a tracheotomy. Despite weeks of exploratory operations on Baldry&#x27;s lung, the prognosis was grim; his doctor believed that he was unlikely to survive, and even if he did, he would likely not be able to perform again due to the damage to his lungs. On 1 July, Baldry&#x27;s condition was deemed beyond treatment, as he had contracted MRSA due to his depleted immune system. Baldry&#x27;s personal friend and unofficial archivist, Jeff Edmunds, selected Sister Rosetta Tharpe&#x27;s &quot;Up Above My Head&quot; as the last song Baldry listened to. Surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones, Baldry was pronounced dead at 10:30 pm on 21 July 2005 at Vancouver General Hospital at the age of 64. The cause of death was listed as a severe chest infection. He was survived by Rexach, his brother Roger, and his sister Margaret.

<text>Pobóg is a Polish coat of arms that was used by many noble families in medieval Poland and later under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

Research by professional analysts using references such as &quot;Herbarz Polski&quot; by Kaspar Niesiecki, &quot;Herbarz Polski&quot; by Adam Boniecki, &quot;Herby Rodów Polskich&quot; and &quot;Rycerstwo polskie wieków średnich&quot; by Professor F. Piekosiński revealed that the Pobóg origins trace back to the forming of tribal clans probably established by Goths in 150 AD. The system was associated with the ancient Slavonic family community structure and Sarmatian family system. In the struggles for control over agricultural soil, the feudal clan system evolved as the best defense against invaders sweeping in from the east and west.

According to legend strongly supported by Professor F. Piekosiński, the Pobóg-Pobodze clan is a junior branch of the Popielid dynasty, which ruled Poland from the 7th through 9th centuries, before the Bolescic-Piast dynasty (9th to 14th centuries), another junior branch of the Popielid dynasty. The Popielids-Pobóg clan is part of the senior branch of the Popielid dynasty, the Ogończyk clan, as Polish clan history research by Piekosiński suggests.

The Pobóg name was most likely formed from the proclamation Pobodze, call &quot;wishing&quot; in old Polish Po Bodze (&quot;may God keep you in His care&quot;). In oldest judicial records it is found in that form precisely. Proclamation Pobóg appear in family in 16th century. Other historians claim that the name Pobóg derived from the name of this Bug River. In this statement Pobóg means &quot;after Bug&quot;. They placed the Pobóg clan&#x27;s ancient territory around the Bug River in North-East Malopolska (Lesser Poland). So, estates in Małopolska were just one portion of the clan territories. 

The great families of the Pobóg clan reached noble status for their services to prince, faith and community as warriors and scholars. They later become even more prominent as numerous branches of the same house acquired distant estates, some of which were located in other countries. From the 12th century onwards, this ancient clan was identified with the great social and economic evolution which made this territory a landmark contributor to the development of the nation in the 14th century. Pobóg clan participated in the victorious crusade against pagan Prussians and Yotvingians tribes in 1190 under the command of prince Casimir II the Just. One clan member became famous for personally taking pagan commander prisoner. In 1331 the Pobóg clan participated in a victorious battle at Płowce against Teutonic Order. In 1359, at Poloniny (Polonini) against Moldavian army. In 1410 Pobóg clan participated under its own colours in the biggest and most famous battle in Europe at this time, at Grunwald (Tannenberg), where the Polish and Lithuanian armies were victorious against the Teutonic Order. The families&#x27; warriors were led by Jakub of Koniecpol, palatinus of Sieradz. In 1413 in Horodło (during the signing of the Union of Lublin), Pobóg clan represented by Jakub of Koniecpol and Piotr of Popow had adopted Lithuanian boyar Rało.

Jan Długosz, main Polish mediaeval historian (about 1460 AD), wrote of the Pobóg clan that they were &quot;ad iracundiam proni&quot; (&quot;prone to anger&quot;). According to the work of Jan Długosz and some other documents, the Pobóg coat of arms had in the beginning of 15th century another image.

With the Teutonic Order of Knights pushing from the north and Tartars from the east, the clans fought to position themselves for best survival and trade by forming alliances with families in neighbouring countries.

Casimir IV Jagiellon became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1447, consolidating the two nations, and the clan built many castles during the next century against Turks, Tartars and Muscovites, who became a peril.

The Pobóg clan of families continued to make important contributions to the life of Europe in the middle and later. From the 15th century onwards they held significant positions of prestige and power becoming involved in tribal struggles for supremacy, and branched into Pomorze (Pomerania), Russia, Latvia, Lithuania and also Moravia, Hungary and Moldavia. Notable from this time amongst the Clans of Poland was the ancient Pobóg clan of families.

== Famous Ancestors ==

Stefan was archbishop of Gniezno. At Stefan&#x27;s, instigation the sejm was called in Gniezno at which it was decided to bring Kazimierz from the Cluniac monastery and put him on his father&#x27;s throne, to which end they would not stint their work and efforts. He then went to Rome and asked Pope Benedict IX to release Kazimierz from his monastic vows and profession; then in Cluny he labored to talk Kazimierz into assuming the throne of Poland. Kazimierz bowed to his pleas and persuasions, and Stefan accompanied him back to Poland and crowned him and his wife, kin to the Ruthenian princes; and he also placed the crown on Boleslaw the Bold after him. He brought a lawsuit against the Bohemians over the pillaging of Poland and especially of the Gniezno cathedral, but he gained little from this. Death overtook him during these efforts in 1059.

Paprocki in &quot;Gniazdo cnoty&quot; mentions Bolesta, cup-bearer to king Kazimierz, in 1080. The same author writes on the basis of Czyrzyce monastery lists that Stefan, Kraków palatinus (duke), was flourishing in 1145. Paprocki, after Kromer, lists another Bolesta, castellan of Wizna, who held a certain part of the administration in Prussia in 1167, in the days of Bolesław IV the Curly. His son was supposedly the first starosta (count) of Płock. In the same place he read of Florjan, palatinus (duke) of Sandomierz died in 1243. Comes (count) Msciwoj sealed a document in Pobóg coat of arms in 1231 and 1235. His son was Mikolaj palatinus (duke) of Kraków. Other Pobóg&#x27;s Adam was Kraków castellan in 1260. Paprocki also includes Jakob, Sieradz castellan, here; according to him, Jakób was the father of Piotr, bishop of Płock, who died in 1263. Bernard, also bishop of Płock was a member of Pobóg clan also. Wolmir, bishop of Kujawy, in „Lives of the Kujawy&quot; by bishop Darnalewski states that he was a Pobóg; from pastor of Kruszwica to Kujawy canon, he was chosen by the chapter for the see in 1258; he was chancellor under the Mazovian princes Ziemowit and Kazimierz. He suffered many wrongs at the hands of Swietopelk, prince of Pomerania, and had many quarrels with Kazimierz, prince of Łęczyca and Kujawy, when he laid upon him the censure of the church; many estates went to the Kujawy church, both bought by him and bestowed by various lords. Having successfully established the border between his diocese and that of Chełmno, he died in 1271. Damalewski numbers Swietosław, bishop of Poznań, among the Pobógs. Bolesta, Mazovian general starosta (count), is on a letter of Mazovian prince Jan in 1387, as shown in Paprocki&#x27;s &quot;O herbach&quot;. (IMPW)

<text>Antoine Duhamel (30 July 1925 – 11 September 2014) was a French composer, orchestra conductor and music teacher.

== Life and career ==
Born in Valmondois in the Val-d&#x27;Oise département of France, Antoine Duhamel was one of the three sons of the French writer Georges Duhamel and actress Blanche Albane. He studied music at the Sorbonne. He was a pupil of René Leibowitz, an exponent of Arnold Schoenberg’s dodecaphonic and serial method of composing. Together with other Leibowitz pupils, Serge Nigg, André Casanova and Jean Prodromidès, he gave the first performance of Leibowitz&#x27;s &quot;Explications des Metaphors&quot;, Op. 15, in Paris in 1948. He wrote the score for his first film in 1960, going on to work with many of Europe&#x27;s film directors. In 2002 he was awarded the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for his music for the Bertrand Tavernier directed film, Laissez-passer.

Duhamel scored several of Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s films, including &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; and &quot;Week End&quot;. He died at the age of 89 in September 2014.

<doc id="1064897" wikidata="Q425550" url="?curid=1064897" title="Steel Angel Kurumi">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by Kaishaku. An anime series adaptation directed by Naohito Takahashi, animated by Oriental Light and Magic, produced by Pony Canyon with character designs by Yuriko Chiba and Yūji Ikeda and music by Toshihiko Sahashi has been translated and released in North America by ADV Films. In 2008, Crunchyroll announced it had partnered with Pony Canyon to release the &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi&quot; series for streaming and download. The entire series was compiled in a Blu-ray box set by Pony Canyon on September 19, 2012.

The Kurumi series as a whole consists of the first season &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi&quot;, four OVA episodes entitled &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi Encore&quot;, a second season by the name of &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi 2&quot;, and a prequel OVA series entitled &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi 0&quot;. A live-action adaptation was made, titled &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi Pure&quot;, but has a different continuity to the anime. This series was originally aired in Japan as part of Wowow&#x27;s Anime Complex.

The first anime series is set in an alternate history version of Japan during the Taishō period, while the second series takes place in the 21st century.

==Plot==
Steel Angel Kurumi 1: Set during Japan&#x27;s Taishō era, The story follows a young boy named Nakahito Kagura. He is pushed by a group of his classmates to go into a house that is rumored to belong to a mad scientist. While inside, he comes across in what seems to be a lifelike doll. At the same time, the Japanese Army carries out an attack on the house. During the attack the &quot;doll&quot; falls over and Nakahito accidentally kisses it, causing it to awaken. The doll turns out to be a Steel Angel called Kurumi, who is being hunted by the military for mysterious reasons.

Steel Angel Kurumi 2: Seventy-five years later, Nako Kagura is the great-granddaughter of the main protagonist from the previous series who is shown to be a high school student and an aspiring musician who also gets her chance to discover the existence of Kurumi and the Steel Angels. Unfortunately after Kurumi steals her first kiss, Nako&#x27;s wealthy childhood friend Uruka Sumeragi becomes furious and upset; and does everything in her power (which including hiring her father&#x27;s highly trained agents and powerful mecha-like robots) to defeat Kurumi and win back Nako&#x27;s affection.

==Characters==

===First series===
:
:The primary male protagonist for the show, Nakahito unwittingly becomes the master of Steel Angel Kurumi when he accidentally awakens her with a kiss. Hesitant and unsure of himself, he teaches Kurumi as much as he can while slowly falling in love with the hyperactive girl. A mystic of the Onmyou (yin and yang) tradition, he has no observable powers. Much to his chagrin, his older brother Kamihito boasts great control of spiritual abilities. Although he has latent potential, as evidenced by his awakening of Kurumi, Nakahito&#x27;s numerous attempts at honing his direct abilities end in failure. Clearly caught between manhood and boyhood, Nakahito seems unsure of how to handle the relentless attention of Kurumi and his other numerous one-sided love interests.
:
:A Steel Angel built by Dr. Ayanokouji and equipped with a Mark II Heart, she is awakened by Nakahito&#x27;s kiss in the first episode and immediately becomes possessive of him while simultaneously pledging her love and service to him. The main female lead and an incredibly wild individual, she is overwhelmingly manic when it comes to Nakahito, whom she calls &quot;Master&quot;. She is very protective of her master and her sisters, she will stop at nothing to ensure their safety. She is impossibly strong and rather handily defeats all her opponents due to her Mark II Heart. Although she does her best to follow orders and help out the Kagura brothers, her clumsy and ditzy nature proves to be a significant stumbling block. She is the oldest of the Angel &quot;sisters&quot; and assumes a fairly typical &quot;older sister&quot; attitude when speaking with them. Kurumi has pink hair and wears a blue maid&#x27;s outfit with red trim.
:
:Another Steel Angel built by Dr. Ayanokouji, Saki was activated by Dr. Amagi with Dr. Brandow&#x27;s help, and given orders to destroy Kurumi and seize her Mark II Heart. Amagi and the General decide to use the largest of the seized Angel Hearts to give Saki as much power as possible. Saki and Kurumi fight, with the latter being defeated easily due to Nakahito&#x27;s still-standing order to not fight. The victory is short-lived however, as Saki&#x27;s improper activation causes her to collapse. Kurumi kisses Saki, and her Mark II Heart re-energizes Saki&#x27;s Angel Heart. The action permanently activates Saki, and the master-servant relationship is reinstated, with Saki pledging her loyalty and love to Kurumi. Kurumi largely ignores this vow, but the two mutually call each other &quot;sister&quot; from then on. Saki is very quiet, the antithesis of Kurumi, and is quite lady-like in comparison. She is the kindest, and maybe the sweetest character in the show. She maintains wild fantasies about herself and Kurumi, but never speaks about them or properly expresses her love.
:
:The third Steel Angel built on the design by Dr. Ayanakouji, she was activated by the Academy to destroy Kurumi. She is very strong due to having two Angel Hearts installed instead of one; however, this also means she is exempted from following the orders of Dr. Walski, her creator. Karinka is infamous for kidnapping and nearly killing Saki. She is very temperamental, devious, and has occasionally shown traits of sadism. She later joins Nakahito and the group, originally to figure out Kurumi&#x27;s power, but she eventually develops a crush on Nakahito. It was thanks to Nakahito that Karinka became friendly. Like her elder sisters, she does not care if Nakahito sees her naked.

===Second series===
:
:Great granddaughter of Nakahito, Nako is a bespectacled soft-spoken, shy, and clumsy 9th grade student at an all-girls school called Momonoki Academy. She lives at the old Kagura shrine with her single mother, Misaki (which proves even further that dark blue hair just runs in the family), and lives next door to her very rich neighbor and best friend, Uruka. Nako is also a very skilled cellist, and may prove to one day be famous. The day she found Kurumi was the day she gave her first kiss, and from then on was the new master of Steel Angel Kurumi. Now being the receiver of the same affection that was given to her great ancestor Nakahito, Nako is constantly chased and protected by Kurumi.
:
:A Steel Angel built by Dr. Ayanokouji and equipped with a Mark II Heart, she is reawakened by Nako&#x27;s kiss in the first episode and gives the same affection to Nako that was given to her last master Nakahito.
: 
:A tenth grade high school student at Momonoki Academy and the best friend of Nako until Kurumi came along. Uruka is in love with Nako, and had originally hoped to be the one to take Nako&#x27;s first kiss. On the day that Kurumi appeared, she was the first witness to see the fateful kiss, to which she could not get over for an entire day. Uruka now sees Kurumi as an obstacle to Nako and will try anything to remove Kurumi, even if it means asking her father to call upon the family&#x27;s private army to take her down. When they find that Saki is a Steel Angel, the family army decides to use her as a weapon against Kurumi, the &quot;source of Uruka-chan&#x27;s unhappiness.&quot; On the day that Saki was to be awakened, Uruka was there to supervise the process, but got involved in a fantasy of her own, involving Nako, and ended up kissing Saki. Saki then falls in love with her new master, and Uruka wants nothing to do with her.
;Kyanwan
:The first animal Steel Angel, Kyanwan is Kurumi&#x27;s pet dog that has the ability to transform into a jet, which then transforms into mechanical wings for Kurumi, or also into fins for speed underwater. Part cute &quot;magical girl&quot; pet and useful plot device, Kyanwan generally remains by Kurumi&#x27;s side unless he is with Nako&#x27;s mother.
:
:Uruka&#x27;s wealthy, loving father. He owns an entire collection of mecha robots and gear that his daughter Uruka uses to destroy Kurumi.
:Uruka Sumeragi&#x27;s father slammed his fist on his table and his statue crumbled to pieces, revealing Saki in the statue. She was activated by a kiss of Uruka Sumeragi. She is in love with both Kurumi and Uruka.
:Although not a new character, she does get a character design makeover. Losing the &quot;flight attendant leotard&quot; look that she had in the first series, she now has curly pigtails and pants. Again history repeats itself in her introduction, and just like last time, her awakening was not by a kiss. Having no master, she runs off of the program that Steel Angels are to protect humanity, not fall in love and become servants to them. Karinka Mark II&#x27;s upgrades include built-in flight ability and increased tactical battle data. Again, history repeats when Karinka kidnaps Saki, fights Kurumi, and loses after finding that Kurumi has more strength and will to fight because of love, specifically Nako. And all over again, Karinka gets a crush on whomever Kurumi loves, and Nako becomes victim to another suitor.
:
:Nako&#x27;s eccentric single mother, who allow&#x27;s Kurumi to live in her household.
:
:Nako&#x27;s music teacher.

==Media==

===Manga===
The manga was being produced first. However, it is significantly different from the anime. In the manga, Nakahito discovers Kurumi in the same fashion, he was being bullied and fell into Dr. Ayanoukoji&#x27;s lab.

The academy travels back in time to find the world&#x27;s greatest mystic. To do that, they give each nation the ability to design its own steel angel. They then hold a Steel Fight to see who the strongest mystic is. During the Steel Fight, all steel angels are shut down because of a revolt, and a demon exits her fake steel angel body. She places a curse on Nakahito and travels into the future. The crew also goes into the future to destroy the demon and remove the curse. They live with Dr. Amagi&#x27;s granddaughter.

===Anime===
====&quot;Steel Angel Kurumi&quot;====
A 24-episode anime television series was animated by Oriental Light and Magic and directed by Naohito Takahashi. The anime aired in Japan on Wowow between October 5, 1999, and April 4, 2000.

====&quot;Steel Angel Kurumi Encore&quot;====
Four additional OVA short stories of the Steel Angels: Saki becomes a film actress, Karinka goes on a blind date with Kamihito, Kurumi practices the art of becoming a traditional Japanese woman, and the rest of the Steel Angels engage in a contest to win Nakahito&#x27;s heart.

====&quot;Steel Angel Kurumi 2&quot;====
An alternate story of the Steel Angel Kurumi series set in the early 21st century. Bringing back the feeling of love polygons, the twist in this 12-episode continuation is that almost all of the characters are female, bringing a Yuri element to the story.

The story takes place back at the Kagura Shrine, in AD 200X, about 4 generations after Nakahito Kagura. One day, Nako Kagura and her best friend Uruka get lost in the shrine&#x27;s basement labyrinth (formerly a bomb shelter) and run across a dog and a giant, scary, flying statue. As Nako and Uruka run away from the scary flying statue, Nako trips and is caught by the statue, which covers her in a divine light. She is then given a message by Dr. Ayanakouji through the statue, the statue then breaks apart and out falls Kurumi, right onto Nako&#x27;s lips. Again, the events come full circle, and Kurumi awakens from a new master&#x27;s kiss.

====&quot;Steel Angel Kurumi Zero&quot;====
This OVA story takes place in the distant future in which Kurumi, Saki, and Karinka all live inside of an apartment together along with their landlady Excelia. The 3 episode OVA which aired in the midst of the second series, takes place mainly inside of the apartment as Kurumi comes home to the apartment from school to notify her house mates that she has met a boy at school whom she has fallen in love with.

The story then proceeds from there as Kurumi handles her depression and loneliness after the boy she is in love with moves away from her, and then finds out that he is dying. In every episode, the feelings within Kurumi causes a glowing angel to appear before her, and later, in front of the others.

This series has a much darker story, with no comedy or action elements as evident in the other series. The color palette is very limited except for the characters who still keep their colorful, bright hair.

===Live-action series===
&quot;Steel Angel Kurumi Pure&quot; (鋼鉄天使くるみpure) is a 24 episode Japanese television drama produced in 2002. The story is set the 21st century where the rapid evolution of robot technology makes it possible to use them as nurses in hospitals. These new robots are then referred to as &#x27;kangoroids&#x27;. Ayanokouji Corporation is the leading company in this area. They are developing new kangoroids for home use, which has the code name &#x27;Steel Angel&#x27;. When the 1st prototype named Kurumi is completed, they choose one boy as its monitor. The boy is Nakahito Kagura, a nephew of the president of Ayanokouji Corporation. He is a junior high student but he has contained himself in his room after an incident and refuses to leave. He soon receives a package in the mail that contains the prototype Kurumi kangoroid. While he&#x27;s embarrassed with Kurumi at first, her devotion slowly makes him accept her.

==Reception==

In a review at Anime News Network, Zac Bertschy commented that &quot;The storyline is mostly forgettable&quot;, however he added that &quot;The animation is smooth and polished, moreso than other series in this vein. The music, especially the catchy opening theme song, is surprisingly well-done and pleasant to listen to.&quot; 

Chris Beveridge from Mania gave &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi 2&quot; a &quot;B&quot; and noted that &quot;It&#x27;s a sequel that, while it&#x27;s not the best thing in the world, it doesn’t actively harm your thoughts on the first series.&quot;

Steel Angel Kurumi is rated 6.7/10 on IMDB based on 197 user reviews (as of July 2024).

<doc id="1064909" wikidata="Q1811957" url="?curid=1064909" title="Lee Roy Jordan">
<text>Lee Roy Jordan (born April 27, 1941) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide under head coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant, he played 14 years in the NFL for the Cowboys from 1963 to 1976. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Excel, Alabama, Jordan was the fifth of seven children of Walter Sr. and Cleo Jordan. He has three older brothers Walter Jr., Carl and Bennie Ray and three sisters Lottie, Agnes and Darlene (who died at age two, of leukemia). He was a standout at fullback at Excel High School and graduated in 1959. He played college football for the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa under head coach Bear Bryant.

Jordan excelled as both a linebacker and center for the Crimson Tide. In his sophomore season of 1960, he helped the Crimson Tide finish with an 8–1–2 record. In the Bluebonnet Bowl, versus the Texas Longhorns, he was named the game&#x27;s MVP in a 3–3 tie.

The following year, Jordan was again an important part of the team as Alabama finished with an 11–0 record, a Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship, and the national championship. The season included six shutouts, which included a 34–0 win over rival Auburn. Led by senior quarterback Pat Trammell (1940–1968), Alabama wrapped up the season with a 10–3 victory over Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl.

In his senior season in 1962, the Crimson Tide fell short of another national championship with a 10–1 record with sophomore quarterback Joe Namath. The loss was by one point at Georgia Tech in mid-November, their first defeat in over two years. In his final game for the Tide, Jordan recorded 31 tackles in a 17–0 victory over Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, attended by President John F. Kennedy. For his performance, he received his second MVP award in a bowl game. At the end of his senior year, he received unanimous All-American status and the Lineman of the Year award.

During his career for Alabama, Jordan received high praise from Bryant, who stated, &quot;He was one of the finest football players the world has ever seen. If runners stayed between the sidelines, he tackled them. He never had a bad day, he was 100 percent every day in practice and in the games.&quot;

In early August 1963 in Chicago, he was part of the College All-Star team that defeated the defending champion Green Bay Packers.

In 1980, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. In 1983, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1988, he received the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award.

==Professional career==
Jordan was selected sixth overall in the 1963 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys, and was the fourteenth overall pick in the AFL draft, taken by the Boston Patriots. He chose the NFL and signed in early January. During preseason in 1963 he was named the Cowboys&#x27; weakside linebacker and became the first rookie linebacker in franchise history to start a season-opener.

He shared time with Jerry Tubbs at middle linebacker in 1965, then took over and teamed up with Chuck Howley and Dave Edwards to form one of the greatest linebacking corps in NFL history. His teammates nicknamed him &quot;Killer&quot; and named him team captain for the defense.

In 1971, he had a team-record 21 tackles against Philadelphia Eagles on September 26. On November 4, 1973, he intercepted three passes in the first quarter from the Cincinnati Bengals&#x27; Ken Anderson within the span of five minutes, returning one 31 yards for a touchdown. The picks were collectively named one of the ten most memorable moments in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN in 2008.

Jordan was usually the smallest middle linebacker in the league at only and ( more than at Alabama), but his competitiveness and drive made up for his lack of size. Head coach Tom Landry said of Jordan, &quot;He was a great competitor. He was not big for a middle linebacker, but because of his competitiveness, he was able to play the game and play it well. His leadership was there and he demanded a lot out of the people around him as he did of himself.&quot; He ran Landry&#x27;s &quot;Flex&quot; defense on the field with unmatched intensity and efficiency. He watched game film endlessly; his contract included a projector for his home.

He became the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in solo tackles (743) in his 14 seasons with the Cowboys. He was a two-time All-Pro and a five-time Pro Bowler. He also helped the Cowboys to three Super Bowls and five NFC Championship games. Jordan was an able defender against the run and pass, and had a penchant for recovering loose footballs. He remains tied for second in club history with 18 career fumble recoveries.

More than 25 years after his retirement, Jordan still ranks second in Cowboys&#x27; history in career solo tackles with 743, second in career assisted tackles with 493, second in combined total tackles with 1,236 and first with 154 consecutive starts. He also holds the third and fourth highest totals of solo tackles in a single season with 100 in 1975 and 97 in 1968. In his 14 NFL seasons, he intercepted 32 passes (seventh in club history), returning them for 472 yards and three touchdowns.

He was selected to Cowboys Silver Season All-Time Team. In 1988, he was among fifteen finalists for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame but did not make the cut (among those finalists, him and Lou Rymkus are the only ones who did not eventually become elected into the Hall). In 1989, he became the seventh member of the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor. He was the first member inducted by Jerry Jones.

In 2018, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Jordan to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2018 

==Personal life==
Jordan married his college sweetheart, Mary &quot;Biddie&quot; Banks of Eutaw, and they had three sons, David, Lee and Chris Jordan.

Jordan currently heads the Lee Roy Jordan Lumber Company, headquartered in Dallas.

<text>John Jeremy Pierce (born 1941) is an American science fiction editor, historian and critic.

== Career ==

Pierce published the science fiction fanzine &quot;Renaissance&quot; from 1968 through 1974, and was an outspoken critic of the New Wave. In the 1970s he edited &quot;The Best of Murray Leinster&quot;, &quot;The Best of Cordwainer Smith&quot; and &quot;The Best of Raymond Z. Gallun&quot; for Del Rey Books. In 1977–78, he was named editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot; at a time when the magazine was in financial trouble, an experience he later recounted in &quot;Thirteen Months of Torment&quot;.

After leaving &quot;Galaxy&quot;, Pierce focused on a four-volume (1987–1994) critical history of science fiction under the general title, &quot;A Study in Imagination and Evolution&quot;, adopting a conceptual framework, as opposed to a strictly chronological approach, and using parallels with biological evolution and dialectics to characterize the evolution of the genre as a whole. As of 2012, he was working on a revised and updated version.

He has written critical essays and book introductions on Cordwainer Smith, and essays on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; for the fanzines &quot;Wrapped in Plastic&quot; and &quot;Spectrum&quot; and has had other articles published in &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction and Science Fiction Studies&quot;. Besides works related to science fiction and popular culture, he is the author of a family history, &quot;The Children of Levi Peacock&quot; (2002).

==Personal life==
Pierce is the son of John Robinson Pierce, the engineer, scientist (and science fiction writer) who coined the word &quot;transistor&quot;. He is married to Marcia (née Feinbaum), widow of Arata Suzuki, and lives in Ramsey, New Jersey. He works as an editor at two trade magazines, &quot;Private Label&quot; and &quot;Quick Frozen Foods International&quot;.

<doc id="1064914" wikidata="Q1814176" url="?curid=1064914" title="Sigma Xi">
<text>Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society () is an international non-profit honor society for scientists and engineers. Sigma Xi was founded at Cornell University by a junior faculty member and a small group of graduate students in 1886 and is one of the oldest honor societies. Membership in Sigma Xi is by invitation only, where members nominate others on the basis of their research achievements or potential. Sigma Xi goals aim to honor excellence in scientific investigation and encourage cooperation among researchers in all fields of science and engineering. Many of the world&#x27;s most influential scientists have been members of Sigma Xi, such as Albert Einstein, Linus Pauling, Barbara McClintock, and Sally Ride.

==Overview==
Sigma Xi has nearly 60,000 members who were elected to membership based on their research achievements and potential. It has more than 500 chapters in North America and around the world. In addition to publishing &quot;American Scientist&quot; magazine, Sigma Xi provides grants annually to promising young researchers and sponsors a variety of programs supporting ethics in research, science and engineering education, the public understanding of science, international research cooperation and the overall health of the research enterprise. The Society is based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

Sigma Xi was one of six honor societies that co-founded the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) on . Its participation was short lived, with the decision to withdraw and operate again as an independent society made just over a decade later, effective in . It resigned from ACHS because &quot;it had decided to devote itself to research primarily, that it no longer considered itself a strictly college organization, and hence was somewhat outside of the field occupied by the Association, and that for these reasons it felt constrained to withdraw from the Association.&quot;

Today, Sigma Xi participates in a more loosely coordinated lobbying association of four of the nation&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious honor societies, called the Honor Society Caucus. Its members include Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Xi, and Omicron Delta Kappa.

==History==
Sigma Xi originated in 1886 at Cornell University. Founded by engineering students and Cornell faculty member, Frank Van Vleck, the society&#x27;s primary objective was to acknowledge significant scientific research and foster cooperation among scientists from various disciplines.

By 1888, Sigma Xi included five female members and established chapters at educational institutions such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Rutgers College. By the end of the 19th century, the society consisted of over 1,000 members in eight chapters.

In the early 20th century, following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Sigma Xi&#x27;s Stanford and Berkeley chapters were involved in reconstruction and public health initiatives. The society later introduced the publication &quot;American Scientist&quot;, which discusses scientific and technological developments. During World War I, the National Research Council collaborated with Sigma Xi to organize research facilities. The society expanded significantly after the war, and by the 1930s, it had chapters at prestigious institutions like Harvard, Caltech, MIT, and Princeton.

Sigma Xi initiated the Distinguished Lectureships Program in the late 1930s, aimed at promoting its activities and research findings. By 1950, the society&#x27;s membership numbered 42,000. In 1947, the Scientific Research Society of America (RESA) was created to support research in various settings. The two societies combined in 1974 under the name Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society. In 1989, Sigma Xi revised its mission statement, emphasizing the importance of science and its role in society. Currently, Sigma Xi has approximately 60,000 members in over 500 chapters worldwide. The society remains committed to recognizing scientific achievements and promoting global collaboration in science and technology. Notable past presidents of Sigma Xi include Frederick Robbins, a Nobel Prize recipient, and Rita Colwell, the former National Science Foundation Director.

==Motto and name==
The Greek letters &quot;Sigma&quot; and &quot;Xi&quot; form the acronym of the Society&#x27;s motto, or &quot;Spoudon Xynones,&quot; which translates as &quot;Companions in Zealous Research.&quot; The word &#x27;Honor&#x27; was added to the name of the Society at the 2016 Annual Meeting. According to Sigma Xi President Tee L. Guidotti,

&quot;Sigma Xi, of course, is our basic name and has been since the organization was founded in 1886 as the scientific and engineering counterpart to Phi Beta Kappa. Like all &quot;Greek letter&quot; societies, whether professional or social, it is an acronym for the motto of the organization, (Spoudon Xynones), which translates as &quot;companions in Zealous Research.&quot; For many years, we were referred to as &quot;Society of the Sigma Xi.&quot; In the early twentieth century, some in the leadership wanted &quot;Sigma Xi&quot; to be dropped altogether in favor of some formulation such as &quot;Scientific Research Society of America.&quot; In a strange quirk of history, both names survived because the organization split in the 1940s into an academic honor society (Sigma Xi) and an honor society for applied research and engineering (the Scientific Research Society of America, called RESA). RESA was a separate entity, wholly owned by Sigma Xi, and represented engineers and scientists at non-academic institutions, such as government and industrial research laboratories. In an even stranger development, Sigma Xi and RESA merged back together in 1974 and eventually began calling itself Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society.&quot;

==William Procter Prize==

The William Procter Prize for Scientific Achievement is an award presented by Sigma Xi. This prestigious prize is given to a scientist who has made an outstanding contribution to scientific research and has demonstrated an ability to communicate the significance of this research to scientists in other disciplines.

The prize was established in 1950 in honor of William Procter, a distinguished business leader and philanthropist who had a strong commitment to scientific research and development. Procter was an heir to the Procter &amp; Gamble Company and served as its president and chairman.

Recipients of the William Procter Prize are recognized for their achievements in both research and communication, reflecting the dual emphasis of Sigma Xi on promoting both scientific excellence and interdisciplinary communication. Along with the recognition, the awardee also delivers a lecture at the society&#x27;s annual meeting or another appropriate occasion.

Over the years, the William Procter Prize has been awarded to many notable scientists from a wide range of disciplines, underscoring the prize&#x27;s commitment to honoring and promoting interdisciplinary research.

==Chapters==
As of May 4, 2023, 350 chapters are active in the United States, 170 are inactive, and the society has chartered over 20 chapters in other countries.

==Notable members==

More than 200 winners of the Nobel Prize have been Sigma Xi members, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, James Watson, Barbara McClintock, John Goodenough, and Jennifer Doudna.

<text>Chirton is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, on the southern edge of the Vale of Pewsey about south-east of Devizes. The parish includes the hamlet of Conock, about half a mile west of Chirton village.

Both settlements are just north the A342 Devizes-Andover road and are reached by separate lanes from the main road. The northern boundary of the parish follows approximately the course of the River Avon, and in the south the parish extends onto Salisbury Plain.

== History ==
Chirton (17 households and one mill) and Conock (18) were recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Early in the 12th century an estate at Chirton was granted to the recently established Lanthony Priory, Gloucester, who retained it until the Dissolution.

The mill recorded in Domesday Book was probably that later known as Church Mill, on the Avon in the north-east corner of the parish. It belonged to Chirton manor and therefore later to Lanthony; by 1572 it was owned by John Eyre of Wedhampton, Chirton and Great Chalfied. A descendant sold it in 1671 to Ralph Brideoake, dean of Salisbury, who presumably made the purchase on behalf of the almshouses at Heytesbury, whose charity owned it until the early 20th century. Their tenants, the Chandler family, used the site for malting; there was also a corn mill in the later 19th century. The buildings fell into disuse in the early 20th century and today those that remain are dwellings.

The population of the parish peaked around the middle of the 19th century, with 467 recorded at the 1851 census, around a third of them at Conock. Numbers declined to 261 by 1901.

Some of downland in the southernmost part of the parish, south of an ancient east-west track, was purchased by the War Department in 1899–1900 and today forms part of the Salisbury Plain Training Area.

When the Stert and Westbury Railway was opened through the Vale in 1900, the nearest station was near Patney, north of Chirton village. Known initially as &#x27;Patney Bridge&#x27;, this was soon changed to &#x27;Patney and Chirton&#x27; to avoid confusion with Putney Bridge station in London. The station closed in 1966.

=== Conock ===
The manor recorded in Domesday Book was held by Robert, Count of Mortain (half-brother of William the Conqueror) and tenanted by Grestain Abbey, Normandy. By at least the 14th century it was administered from Wilmington Priory, the abbey&#x27;s cell in East Sussex. In 1324 the land was seized by the king, along with other alien priories, and it was acquired in the 1350s by Michael de la Pole (later Lord Chancellor and Earl of Suffolk), and his brothers Edmund and Thomas. In 1442 their descendant William (later Duke of Suffolk), together with his wife Alice, gave the manor to their recently established almshouse at Ewelme, Oxfordshire (Alice&#x27;s home village).

The Ewelme charity retained the Conock estate into the 20th century. Their tenants included several Ernle generations, beginning with Sir Walter Ernle, 1st Baronet (died 1682). During the 18th century, their descendants the Warriners gradually acquired leases from the Ewelme trustees, amounting to most of Conock tithing by the early 19th century. The Ewelme trustees sold the manor house in 1945 and Manor Farm in 1948 to Sir Frederick Sykes (died 1954), formerly Chief of the Air Staff, Member of Parliament and Governor of Bombay. In 1970, the charity retained Conock Old Manor, Conock Cottage (18th century) and a few estate cottages; these properties were sold in the early 21st century.

== Religious sites ==
The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist has Norman features; in the 12th century the church was granted to the newly established Llanthony Secunda priory at Gloucester. Some masonry in the chancel is from that century, as is the stone font with its eroded high-quality carving of the twelve apostles. The south doorway of c.1175 has two orders of elaborate carving, described by Orbach as &quot;lavish&quot;. The aisles were made wider in the 14th century, and the tower and south porch were added in the 15th century. The timbers of the nave roof are c.1200 but the chancel roof was replaced in the severe restoration carried out in 1850 by William Butterfield, which also saw changes to several windows and the addition of the vestry. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1962.

The pulpit and pews are by Butterfield, and much of the stained glass is from the same 1850 restoration, including chancel windows by William Wailes. Four of the six bells are from the early 18th century. Monuments in the churchyard include four chest tombs for members of the Bruges family, from the 18th century and early 19th.

The benefice was united with Marden in 1923, and the vicar was to live at the parsonage house in Chirton. From 1951, the vicar also held the benefice of Patney, which was added to the united benefice in 1963. The three benefices were separated in 1976. Today the church is served by the Cannings and Redhorn Team Ministry, which covers a group of eight churches in the Vale of Pewsey.

Conock had a chapel in the 13th century, which fell into disuse after the land was seized by the king.

==Local government==
Chirton is a civil parish with an elected parish council, styled as Chirton &amp; Conock Parish Council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority responsible for almost all local government functions, and is represented there by Paul Oatway.

== Notable buildings ==
The vicarage house mentioned at Chirton in 1609 is probably the present-day Yew Tree Cottage, which has 17th-century timber frames and 19th-century additions. It was replaced by a three-bay brick house close to the church, built c.1800 and extended at the rear to designs of J. P. Seddon in 1878.

The former farmhouse to the east of the church began as a timber-framed house in the 15th or 16th century, and was refaced in brick in the 18th.

The house known as Conock Old Manor was built in the late 17th century, then largely rebuilt in 1753 for Gifford Warriner (died 1787). In brick with stone quoins, the L-shaped two-storey house has seven bays on the west elevation and five on the north. The MP, journalist, author and broadcaster Woodrow Wyatt leased the house for a time and was living there in 1970.

=== Conock Manor ===
Pevsner describes Conock Manor as &quot;a Georgian house of great charm&quot;. There was probably a house here in the 15th century but the present house dates in part from c.1700. It was altered in 1789 for Gifford Warriner (died 1820) and the architect Richard Ingleman carried out improvement and enlargement for his son Ernle in 1817 (Historic England) or soon after 1820 (Orbach); this work included encasing the house in limestone ashlar and adding two single-storey wings to the two-storey house. Interior alterations were made in 1934 by a later lessee, RFC officer Robert Smith-Barry.

The west entrance front has five bays, the central one brought forward and pedimented, above a semicircular porch described as &quot;elegant&quot; by Orbach. The porch has fluted Ionic columns, and at each end of the facade are two-storey pilasters in the same style; these are repeated in pairs on the fronts of Ingleman&#x27;s wings. On the garden side, the central door with broken curved pediment was probably the original front door of 1700. Smith-Barry installed 18th-century marble fireplaces in the hall and in Ingleman&#x27;s library.

The house was designated as Grade II* listed in 1962. In 2010, the nine-bedroom house with and other dwellings were offered for sale at £7.3million.

Access to the estate is through a gateway with four 19th-century limestone piers. As the driveway curves towards the house, decorative iron railings and pedestrian gates line the south-east side. The brick stable block is from the mid to late 18th century, and its two-storey central block has a copper-clad cupola on Tuscan columns; perhaps a later addition, although there is a bell dated 1765.

Around 1820, the surrounding area – including the Old Manor and Manor Farm – was laid out in Picturesque style, with parkland, a ha-ha and tree-planting. A area, encompassing the whole of Conock hamlet, was designated Grade II on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in 1987.

== Amenities ==
Chirton has a church of England primary school which serves the nearby villages. Sited near the church, the building began as a National School in the 1840s.

<text>Elsie Louise Ferguson (August 19, 1883 – November 15, 1961) was an American stage and film actress. Seen by some as an early feminist, she promoted suffrage, which she discussed in interviews, and supported animal rights.

==Early life==
Born in New York City, Elsie Ferguson was the only child of Hiram and Amelia Ferguson. Her father was a successful attorney. Raised and educated in Manhattan, she became interested in the theater at a young age and made her stage debut at 17 as a chorus girl in a musical comedy. For almost two years, from 1903 to 1905, she was a cast member in &quot;The Girl from Kays&quot;. In 1908, she was leading lady to Edgar Selwyn in &quot;Pierre of the Plains&quot;. By 1909, after several years apprenticeship under several producers, including Charles Frohman, Klaw &amp; Erlanger, Charles Dillingham and Henry B. Harris, she was a major Broadway star, starring in &quot;Such a Little Queen&quot;. In 1910, she spent time on the stage in London. Actresses Evelyn Nesbit and Ethel Barrymore were friends of hers.

During World War I, a number of Broadway stars organized a campaign to sell Liberty Bonds from the theatre stage before the performance as well as at highly publicized appearances at places such as the New York Public Library. On one occasion, Ferguson is reputed to have sold $85,000 worth of bonds in less than an hour.

==Stardom==

At the peak of her popularity, several film studios offered her a contract but she declined them all until widely respected New York-based French director Maurice Tourneur proposed she appear in the lead role as a sophisticated patrician in his 1917 silent film &quot;Barbary Sheep&quot;. She also may have consented to films because she no longer had the protection of her Broadway employers Henry B. Harris, who died on the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, and Charles Frohman, who perished on the &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915. Producer and director Adolph Zukor then signed her to an 18-film, three-year, $5,000-per-week contract.

Following this first film, Ferguson was billed prominently in promotional campaigns, and starred in two more films directed by Tourneur under a lucrative contract from Paramount Pictures that paid her $1,000 per day of filming in addition to her weekly contract income. Her only surviving complete silent film is &quot;The Witness for the Defense&quot; (1919), co-starring Warner Oland and performed as a play in 1911 by her friend Ethel Barrymore. A surviving fragment of footage of Ferguson from &quot;The Lie&quot; or &quot;The Avalanche&quot; can be seen in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The House That Shadows Built&quot; (1931). Other brief surviving footage of Ferguson is preserved in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;A Trip to Paramountown&quot; (1922)

Continuing to play roles of elegant society women, Ferguson was quickly dubbed &quot;The Aristocrat of the Silent Screen&quot;, but the aristocratic label also was because she was known as a difficult and sometimes arrogant personality with whom to work. Many of the films she agreed to do were because they were adaptations of stage plays with which she was familiar.

Elsie Ferguson eventually followed the move west and bought a home in the hills of Hollywood, California. In 1920, she traveled to the Middle East and Europe. She fell in love with Paris and the French Riviera, and within a few years, she bought a permanent home there. 

In 1921, she accepted another contract offer from Paramount Pictures to star in four films to be spread over a two-year period. One of these was the 1921 film entitled &quot;Forever&quot; in which she starred with Wallace Reid.

==&quot;Talkies&quot; and retirement==
Ferguson&#x27;s last silent film before returning to Broadway was the 1925 drama &quot;The Unknown Lover&quot;. In 1930, she made her first sound film that also would be her final film, titled &quot;Scarlet Pages&quot;, which is now preserved in the Library of Congress. The film was based on a 1929 Broadway production of the same name that she also starred in. She was described as having a &quot;pleasantly low-pitched voice with perfect diction.&quot;

Well known as difficult to work with, temperamental, and argumentative, she married four times. Following her final marriage at age 51, she and her husband acquired a farm in Connecticut and divided their time between it and her home in Cap d&#x27;Antibes. 

Ferguson made her final appearance on Broadway in 1943, at the age of 60, that met with critical acclaim. She played in &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;, a play written by her neighbor Rose Franken. The play closed eight weeks after it opened. Critics hailed Ferguson&#x27;s performance as &quot;glowing&quot; and having &quot;the charm and winning manner of old.&quot;

Ferguson died in Lawrence Memorial Hospital in New London, Connecticut, in 1961. She lived on an estate called White Gate Farms. She was interred in the Duck River Cemetery in Old Lyme, Connecticut. A very wealthy woman with no heirs and a lover of animals, she left a large part of her considerable estate to a variety of charities, including several for animal welfare.

<doc id="1064938" wikidata="Q2090057" url="?curid=1064938" title="Jelita coat of arms">
<text>Jelita is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families. 

==History==
One of the oldest Polish coats of arms. First depicted on the seal of Tomisław z Mokrska from 1316.

Additionally, the Polish medieval chronicler, diplomat and soldier Jan Długosz referred to those bearing the Jelita coat of arms as &quot;a clan born in Poland of men who are modestly devoted to dogs and hunting.&quot;

==Legend==
Legend has it that this coat of arms was granted by King Władysław I Łokietek to a peasant soldier (and his family) after the Battle of Płowce (1331) in which the Polish armies defeated the 40,000-strong force of the Teutonic Knights with minimal casualties. The man fought with great courage and only fell in battle when pierced by three spears in the abdominal area which caused his bowels to fall out. Shortly before his death, the King ennobled the fatally wounded man. Hence, the three crossed spears in the coat of arms, as well as the name Jelita, Bowels or Guts.

==Blazon==

There are three lances of gold (or yellow), displayed in the design of a star on a red field, so that two on the sides are shown with their ends and points upward and the center lance with its point straight downward. on the helmet is a demi goat leaping with its forepaws upward, facing to the right, with horns on its head. The goat on top is the symbol of persistence, practical wisdom and an emblem of a man who wins through diplomacy rather than war. It may also refer to the goat crest of Lublin. The Act of the Union of Lublin, signed in 1569, created the so-called Commonwealth of two Nations, under one monarch, with one parliament and unified monetary systems.

The heraldic motto of this coat of arms is &quot;To mniey boli&quot; (It hurts less).

==Notable bearers==
Notable bearers of this coat of arms include:

* House of Zamoyski
** Adam Zamoyski
** Jan Zamoyski
** Joanna Barbara Zamoyska
** Gryzelda Konstancja Zamoyska
** Jan &quot;Sobiepan&quot; Zamoyski
** Tomasz Zamoyski

<text>James L. Quinn was an American science fiction editor and publisher.

Quinn was the founding publisher of the science fiction magazine &quot;If&quot; and, after Paul W. Fairman left shortly after its launch in 1952, became its editor as well as publisher until 1958. During his tenure, the magazine&#x27;s circulation never sold as well as he&#x27;d hoped, even with the assistance of Larry Shaw and a short tenure by Damon Knight as editor of the magazine. After several issues edited by Knight failed to reverse the circulation slide (many sf magazines saw a drop in circulation after the 1957 launch of Sputnik, probably for a variety of reasons), Quinn sold the title to Robert Guinn, publisher of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, where it continued with H.L. Gold as the editor, with assistance from eventual editor Frederik Pohl.

Quinn continued primarily as a publisher of word-puzzle magazines into the 1970s; several of his titles continue to be published by Kappa Publishers Group (as of 2011). (&quot;If&quot; was merged with &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1974, though there have been attempts to revive the title since then.)

<doc id="1064953" wikidata="Q3330573" url="?curid=1064953" title="Qualla Boundary">
<text>The Qualla Boundary or The Qualla is territory held as a land trust by the United States government for the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), who reside in Western North Carolina. The area is part of the large historic Cherokee territory in the Southeast, which extended into eastern Tennessee, western South Carolina, northern Georgia, and Alabama. Currently, the largest contiguous portion of the Qualla lies in Haywood, Swain, and Jackson counties and is centered on the community of Cherokee, which serves as the tribal capital of the EBCI. Smaller, non-contiguous parcels also lie in Graham and Cherokee counties, near the communities of Snowbird and Murphy, respectively.

The tribe purchased this land in the 1870s, and it was subsequently placed under federal protective trust; it is not a reservation created by the government. Individuals can buy, own, and sell the land, provided they are enrolled members of EBCI tribe.

==Etymology==
Qualla comes from the Cherokee word (&#x27;old woman&#x27;). It refers to Polly, an elder Cherokee woman who lived in the area.

==Location==
The Qualla Boundary is located at . The main part of the Qualla Boundary lies in eastern Swain and northern Jackson counties (just south of Great Smoky Mountains National Park). A small portion of the main trust lands extends eastward into Haywood County. The trust lands include many smaller non-contiguous sections to the southwest in Marble, Hiwassee, and Hanging Dog areas of Cherokee County, and the Snowbird community in Graham County. The total land area of these regions is 213.934 km2 (82.6 sq mi), with a 2000 census resident population of 8,092 people.

==History==

The Cherokee and their ancestors have long occupied the area, having migrated there centuries before Europeans arrived. During their colonial expansion west, European settlers sometimes came into conflict with the Cherokee, whose territory extended into present-day Tennessee and northern Georgia. After the late 18th century and warfare with American settlers during and after the Revolutionary War, many of the Cherokee moved farther south along the Tennessee River, into Georgia and westward into Alabama, establishing at least eleven new towns .

The Cherokee were forcibly removed in the late 1830s from much of this area, especially the Black Belt in Georgia and Alabama, under federal authority as authorized by Congress in the 1830 Indian Removal Act. They were relocated to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, in what is the present-day state of Oklahoma.

During the winter of 1838 and early the spring of 1839, the U.S. Federal Government relocated approximately 11,000 Cherokee from their homeland in North Carolina, in what is known as the Trail of Tears. Some of the Cherokee were able to evade the initial removal and hide in the Great Smoky Mountains, some were free to stay on their lands because of earlier treaties, but the majority of the Cherokee people were removed from the land. This was when the main struggle for land at what became the Qualla Boundary began.

The Qualla Boundary was first surveyed in 1876 by M. S. Temple under the auspices of the United States Land Office. These pieces were embodied in a map published as the &quot;Map of the Qualla Indian reserve&quot;. The Qualla Boundary is a land trust supervised by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land is a fragment of the extensive historical homeland of the Cherokee in the region and was considered part of the Cherokee Nation during the 19th century, prior to certain treaties and Indian Removal in the 1830s. William Holland Thomas had lived and worked among the Cherokee people for a good portion of his life. He had a knowledge of their traditions and language and was close friends with some members of the tribe. The Cherokee valued and respected Thomas; he had studied law and was adopted into the tribe and named as successor by its hereditary chief. He is the only European American to have served as chief in their history.

Thomas purchased lands around the Oconaluftee River for the tribe, the total area adding up to around 50,000 acres; the purchased lands are a large part of what makes up the Boundary today. The Cherokee organized and formed a corporation in 1870 to be able to purchase and hold additional lands. The Cherokee who gained the ability to live in North Carolina were considered to be an independent band from the Cherokee Nation living in Oklahoma.

In the 1930s, the federal government requested the tribe to cede land for the construction of a new motorway, called the Blue Ridge Parkway, that would cut through the Qualla Boundary to end at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The tribe resisted the federal government, which initially wanted the land for free. In 1939, the tribe and the federal government reached an agreement and signed a pact for right-of-way acquisition; in return the federal government would make a $40,000 payment for the tribe&#x27;s land, require the state to build a regular highway through the Soco Valley (US 19), and transfer two other parcels to the tribe, known as the Boundary Tree tract (north of US 441, near the national park entrance) and Ravensford tract (east of the Oconaluftee River and Raven Fork confluence). Two years later, the U.S. Congress decided not to give the tribe the Ravensford tract as stated in the pact. In 2003, the tribe negotiated a land swap with the federal government; this involved the tribe buying near Waterrock Knob then trading it for the Ravensford tract. In 2009, Cherokee Central Schools opened a $140 million school campus on the Ravensford tract.

==Government and law==

The tribal community functions like most municipalities, operating schools, law enforcement, and rescue services, in addition to their own hospital and gaming casino, known as Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee. They have opened a second location of the casino on their land in Murphy, North Carolina. The tribe has operated a court system since 1987.

Tribal police have exclusive police jurisdiction on Indian lands. The FBI and other federal agencies have jurisdiction to handle certain major federal criminal offenses. N.C. State Highway Patrol, motor vehicle inspectors, wildlife officers, state alcohol agents, SBI agents, and other state peace officers assigned to counties that overlap with the Qualla Boundary can be called to assist tribal law enforcement officers, and can be commissioned as &quot;special officers&quot; of the Department of the Interior to assist in federal investigations. Non-tribal members charged with a crime in Qualla Boundary are referred to county courts.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The Qualla Boundary is divided into seven communities, which are similar to townships.

There are no municipalities, instead each community elects two representatives to the tribal council; except for Cherokee County and Snowbird, which share two representatives to the tribal council. Cherokee, a census-designated place, overlaps most of Painttown and Yellowhill, with a small portion also in Wolftown.

==Education==

From 1890 to 1954, the U.S. Indian Service (later renamed the Bureau of Indian Affairs) operated the Cherokee Boarding Schools in Cherokee. It replaced these with elementary day schools, located closer to students&#x27; homes in Big Cove, Soco, Birdtown, and Snowbird. In 1962 all elementary day schools were consolidated into Central Elementary School in Cherokee. 

In 1975, Cherokee High School was opened with grades seven through twelve. In 1990 Cherokee Central Schools became a tribally operated school district, under a grant from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, with students assigned from Big Cove, Birdtown, Painttown, Wolftown, and Yellowhill communities. In 1996, the school district established the Kituwah curriculum for kindergarten through sixth grade, which incorporates the Cherokee language. Prior to this, the schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs allowed only English to be used. In 2004, the EBCI established the New Kituwah Academy, a private bilingual Cherokee-English language immersion school for Cherokee students in kindergarten through sixth grade, located in the Yellowhill community.

In 1975 Western Carolina University opened its Cherokee Center in cooperation with the EBCI, which is the headquarters for outreach and involvement between residents in the Qualla Boundary and outside surrounding communities. It provides services including application process, transcript request, scholarships, internships placement, high school recruitment, as well as college level courses. The Cherokee Center is supported by an advisory board composed of representatives from the EBCI and Western Carolina University.

==Representation in media==
In the mid-1950s, much of Disney&#x27;s five-part television series, &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (starring Fess Parker), was filmed here.

<doc id="1064958" wikidata="Q1684070" url="?curid=1064958" title="Jastrzębiec coat of arms">
<text>Jastrzębiec () is one of the most ancient Polish coat of arms. Dating back to the 10th century, it has been used by Poland&#x27;s oldest szlachta families — Poland&#x27;s Immemorial nobility — and remains in use today.

==History==

===Legend of the coat of arms===
According to the Polish-Czech writer and heraldist Bartosz Paprocki, this coat of arms is called &quot;Jastrzebiec&quot; because the clan&#x27;s pagan ancestors bore a Goshawk, or &quot;Jastrzab&quot;.

In the era of King Bolesław the Brave, circa 999, during a siege of the mountain fortress Łysa Góra – two miles from Bozecin, now called Swiety Krzyz (Holy Cross) – the Christian besiegers were challenged by the pagan holders of the place, to &quot;Send forth one from among you who is willing to fight for Christ, in a challenge against one of our men.&quot; Jastrzebczyk, a knightly member of the Jastrzebiec clan invented horseshoes that enabled his horse to climb the slippery slopes and to defeat and bring the pagan champion before the king. The rest of the Polish forces, their horses similarly shod, scaled the mountain to defeated their enemy. In gratitude, king granted Jastrzebczyk the right to bear a horseshoe with a cross as part of his arms, with the Goshawk being elevated above the shield.

It is doubtful that Jastrzebczyk in 999, was the first in Poland to shoe horses. Poppaea, in the time of the Roman emperor Nero, had her horse shod with silver shoes. Others before her used iron. In 278, in Bohemia, there was a noble house with three horseshoes on its seal. In Poland, in the time of Leszek II, Leszek the Traitor shod his horse to cross Pradnik Field, which was covered in barbs, to get to a crown on a pillar, and was credited as being the inventor of horseshoes. It may therefore be that Jastrzebczyk renewed a previous practice.

Possibly, the arms arrived in Poland with Lech, the legendary founder of Poland. The cross may have added for a member of his family who was baptized (in &quot;Stromata&quot;, Paprocki affirms that one member of this family while in foreign lands, converted to Christianity there, and this was the cause of the Polish prince Mieczyslaw&#x27;s Mieszko conversion). The antiquity of the arms is further attested to by one of the Jastrzebczyks being among the twelve voivodes who at different times ruled the entire country.

The antiquity of the Jastrzebiec coat-of-arms is also evident by the fact that no other coats of arms is borne by more families. Paprocki says, in &quot;O herbach&quot;, that several hundred years ago the clan called themselves simply Jastrzebczyks. Not until after the days of Archbishop Wojciech of Gniezno did foremost members of this house began to write &quot;z Rytwian&quot; (&quot;from Rytwiany&quot;). Other members similarly named themselves after the estates they possessed.

Jastrezebiec&#x27;s antiquity lead others coat-of-arms to be derived from it, including Dąbrowa, Zagłoba, and Pobóg. These arms are also called &quot;Boleszczyc&quot;, in Silesia, and &quot;Lazanki&quot;, in Mazovia. In other places Jastrzebczyks are called by names coming from the word for &quot;goshawk&quot;, &quot;Kaniowa&quot; or &quot;Kudbrzowa&quot;. In Paprocki&#x27;s day there was a Jastrzebiec castle, belonging to the Zborowskis; General Piotr Zborowski from Rytwiany, Kraków voivode, tore it down, dug it out, and had a large pond put in its place.

===Ancestors of this house===
Based on a grant of privilege to a monastery in 999, Paprocki cites the most ancient member of this house as being a castellan of Sandomierz, a man named Mszczuj. Mszczuj&#x27;s two sons Mszczuj and Jan, who signed themselves &quot;from Jakuszewice&quot;, were both made canons in Kraków by Bishop Lambert in 1061. In 1084, Dlugosz wrote that the Jastrzebczyks who came from Hungary with Mieczyslaw, son of Boleslaw the Bold.

Derszlaw was cup-bearer for King Bolesław Wry-mouth in 1114. Bolesław IV the Curly granted the title to the villages of Jakuszewice and Kobelniki to Derszlaw&#x27;s sons Wojciech and Derszlaw, of whom Wojciech was the Sandomierz standard-bearer. Paprocki cites a fragment of his in &quot;O herbach&quot;, but the long stretch of time between them and their father, 166 years, indicates that they were not the sons of Derszlaw the cup-bearer. Paprocki cites a monastery grant of privilege given in 1199 for Borzywoj and Derszlaw Jastrzebczyk, heirs to Jakuszowice. He also includes Piotr, son of Wojciech, the Sandomierz standard-bearer.

Swentoslaw, a pastor from Poznań and Gniezno canon, was chosen to be bishop of Poznań; already of an advanced age, he had retired, but he yielded to those urging him and accepted the office. He spent only a year at this see before his death in 1176 and was buried in the church. Nakiel. w Miechov. fol. 66, praises the good works of this Swietoslaw, for saving his monastery at its beginning with generous alms; he ascribes to Swietoslaw the Pobog arms. Yet Długosz in &quot;Vitae Episc. Posnan&quot;, and others, call him a Jastrebczyk. Paprocki writes that in Jędrzejów a grave from the year 1206 is covered with a stone on which the Jastrzębiec arms are still visible, but the letters can no longer be read.

Piotr Brevis (called &quot;Maly&quot; (&quot;small&quot;), as &quot;brevis&quot; is Latin for &quot;short&quot;) was chosen to be the nineteenth bishop of Plock in 1254. In the fifth year of his episcopate, he moved to another see. However in &quot;Vitae Episc. Plocens&quot;, Lubienski ascribed no coat-of-arms to him yet wrote Piotr Brevis was of a noble clan. Paprocki in &quot;O herbach&quot;, added that Piotr Brevis was a Jastrzebczyk.

Silesian Bishop Jan of Wrocław was the first Pole to ascend the episcopacy, inasmuch as only Italians had held the position before. Bishop Jan of Wrocław elected in 1062, presided for 10 years, and died in 1072. This is attested to by Dlugosz in &quot;Kronika&quot;, wherein he wrote that Bishop Jan of Wrocław was of the Jastrzebiec clan.

Additional forebears of this clan are Michal, castellan of Kraków in 1225; Mistuj, voivode of Kraków in 1242; Scibor, voivode of Leczyca in 1242; and Msciug, voivode of Sandomierz in 1342. A letter of Kazimierz the Great, King of Poland, given to the Strzelno monastery, mentions, &quot;inter praesentes&quot;, Mszczuj, Kraków chamberlain.

Jedrzej, Bishop of Vilna, called &quot;Vasilo&quot; by the Lithuanians, was an apostolic shepherd in the days of King Władysław II Jagiełło. Kromer. In 1399, Jedrzej proselytized Christianity in pagan Lithuania. Marcisz, brother of Bishop Jedrzej, endowed the Franciscan Fathers in Nowe Miasto with a monastery and he bought Zborów, from which came the family of Zborowskis.

Wojciech, Archbishop of Gniezno, was born in the village of Lubnica. His father, possessed of a meager fortune, gave up Wojciech to the Bensowa parish church. As Dlugosz wrote n &quot;Vitae Episcop. Posnan.&quot;:

I give you up, my son, not into the ranks of students but of bishops. Remember, when you have become a bishop, do not forget your current standing, in which you see both your mother and me, your brothers and sisters: this lack of means in which you were born is greater than could fade from your memory if you had the greatest fortune. When you become a bishop, do this for me, make a church of brick in this place where I give you up for schooling.

Wojciech listened to all of this and promised to fulfill the exhortation as a paternal order. The hopes of both were realized, for Wojciech, soon became a priest, from being a Kraków scholastic, as Dlugosz says, or from being a Kraków dean and Poznan pastor, he became the mitred prelate of Poznan in 1399. Tearing down the wooden church in Bensowa, he had a brick one built in 1407, and later settled the friars of St. Paul the Hermit there, and gave to it the villages of Bensowa, Bensowka, Bydlowa, and Bystronowice. Besides this, he founded the collegiate church in Warsaw, and the cathedral.

Thus for 14 years Wojciech held that post at that church in a laudable manner, so that he was held in high regard by all, both for his wisdom, which was demonstrated at every chancellery function, and for his piety. But he put himself under great strain when, having removed Piotr Wiss, of Leszczyc arms, from the Kraków episcopacy. He recalled Wiss to that of Poznan and he himself occupied the Kraków bishopric in 1412. He had many quarrels because of it: for as soon as the matter arose at the Council of Konstanz it moved all the priests assembled there with compassion for Peter Wiss, and surely Wiss would have returned to his bishopric if he had not died at that point.

Wojciech, more secure after Wiss&#x27;s death, founded a city, having cleared some woods, and called it Jastrzebie. He endowed and gave to it two parish churches in Sandomierz province: one in Wysokie, in Lublin district; the other in Kortynicak, in Sandomierz district. He designated a tithe for the altar of St. Agnes, in Kraków diocese. Then in 1423, he was elevated to the rank of metropolitan and primate, and there left a memory of his generosity, funding two benefices, one theological and one juridical, as well as a third in Kalisz. He set up an altar in Leczyca, returned regular canons to Klodawa, and raised their church to collegiate rank. He died in 1436, an important, judicious man and a great lover of his country, as Dlugosz and Damalew praised him in &quot;Vitae Archiepisc. Gnesn.&quot;, and Starowol. in &quot;Vitae Episc. Cracov&quot;.

Wojciech had amassed considerable wealth, which he left to his successors, and while yet alive bought for them Rytwiany, in Sandomierz district, and Borzyslawice, in Leczyca district, where he funded benefices. The sources of that wealth were suspect, in that the curate of the Poznań Cathedral had shown him the collection and treasury of the ancient kings of Poland, of which the curates had passed on knowledge in secret, each to the next, until that time.

From that time, Wojciech&#x27;s successors began to sign their names as &quot;z Rytwian&quot; (&quot;from Rytwiany&quot;): his brother was Scibor, voivode of Leczyca, who had twenty sons. Paprocki saw all their portraits in the Bensowa church, but the signatures under them could not be read. Eight of the sons died in the Prussian war, the other twelve were various castellans.

In the Jastrzębiec family, there is also the case of a man from the Witowski family, who, on the basis of his marriage, left for Russia, from where, in the next generation, a high-ranking aristocrat Katarina Wiltawsky returned to the vicinity of Krakow, who married a Polish German (Pruska), who took her surnames and Russian titles of nobility. Their descendant Baron Wiltawský attended the coronation of Emperor Charles VI. in Prague. The descendants of this line remained settled in the vicinity of Ratibórz and Opava.

==Blazon==
The following is from the classic heraldic reference &quot;Herbarz Polski&quot;, by Kasper Niesiecki, S. J., Leipzig edition, 1839-1846. In this book, for each &quot;herb&quot; (clan shield or coat of arms) the blazon, or verbal description of the arms, is first given in authentic heraldic style, followed by a translation from the Polish description by Niesiecki.
Arms: azure, a horseshoe reversed, between its branches, a small cross patée en abime, both or. Upon a wreath of the colors mantled of his liveries whereon is set for a crest: out of a ducal coronet, a hawk proper, wings surgent, belled and jessed, holding in its dexter talons, a charge of the shield.

On a shield in a blue field is a gold horseshoe, with its heels pointed straight up, and in its center a cross; on the helmet over a crown is a goshawk with its wings slightly raised for flight, facing the right side of the shield. On its legs are small bells and a leather strap, in its right talon it holds a horseshoe with cross, like those on the shield.
In heraldry, the right and left sides of a shield are considered from the standpoint of the bearer—i. e., the one holding the shield. His right would be your left and vice versa. The tinctures (colors) are as follows: &quot;azure&quot; = blue; &quot;gules&quot; = red; &quot;sable&quot; = black; &quot;or&quot; = gold; &quot;argent&quot; = silver; and &quot;vert&quot; = green. All charges (pictures) on a shield are assumed to be facing dexter (bearer&#x27;s right side) unless otherwise specified. In Polish heraldry, all animals or birds are assumed to be in their natural coloring unless otherwise specified.

<text>Zaremba is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta (noble) families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
The first historical record of the Zaremba coat of arms appears on the shield of Thomas II Zaremba, prince-bishop of Nysa, in 1270 CE. In the 12th century, the Zaremba clan itself founded the town and endowed the church of Tuliszkow. Tuliszkow would become the seat of the Zaremba clan and in 1450, Mikolaj Zaremba, castellan of Leczyca, built the St. Vitus church, which still stands today.

The Zaremba coat of arms is mentioned by Romain Gary in his novel &quot;Promise at dawn&quot;.



==Blazon==
Per fess or and gules, embattled. In chief a demi lion rampant issuant sable, langued gules. In base three golden bricks 2 and 1 garnished or. For a crest: out of a ducal coronet a lion as in the arms.

==Notable bearers==

Thomas II Zaremba, Prince–Bishop of Nysa, 13th century

Marcin of Sławsko, Lord High Steward of Kalisz, 14th century

Andrzej Zaremba, Bishop of Poznań, 14th century

Jan Suchorzewski, nobleman, politician, and soldier (ca. 1740–1804)

Józef Zaremba, Polish military commander and general of the 18th century.

<doc id="1064988" wikidata="Q41140" url="?curid=1064988" title="Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language">
<text>The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language () was a body of academics convened in the early part of the 1900s (decade) to decide on the issue of which international auxiliary language should be chosen for international use. The ultimate decision of the committee charged by the Delegation was to adopt the Esperanto language, but with certain reforms. The result became a distinct language known as Ido.

==Creation==
The Delegation was founded in 1901 by French academics Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau, who had noted the language difficulties arising among international bodies convening during the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. Working with European esperantists, they gathered support for the Delegation from professional societies, companies, and universities.

Among the chief aims of the Delegation were to select a language to be taught alongside &quot;natural languages&quot; and allow written and spoken communication in an international environment. Three conditions were laid out for the language to be chosen:

#It must be capable of serving the needs of science, in addition to everyday life, commerce and general communication,
#It must be able to be easily learned by all people of average education, and especially those of the civilized nations of Europe, and
#It must not be a living language.

In June 1907, the Delegation convened and refused to decide the ultimate issue, but rather, at Couturat&#x27;s insistence, created a committee to make the decision.

==The Committee==
The Delegation Committee arranged to meet in Paris starting on the 15th of October 1907. Supporters of Esperanto, including its author L. L. Zamenhof, warned Couturat that the committee had no authority to impose an international language, but they had received assurances from Couturat that Esperanto would be chosen anyway. The members of the Committee were:

*Manuel Barrios, President of the Peruvian Senate
*Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, Professor of Linguistics, University of St. Petersburg
*Émile Boirac, University of Dijon, author and Esperanto supporter known for the phrase déjà vu
*Charles Jacques Bouchard, Professor, Paris College of Medicine
*Loránd Eötvös, Hungarian Academy of Sciences
*Wilhelm Förster, President of the International Committee for Weights and Measures
*Col. George Harvey, Esperanto supporter and editor of the &quot;North American Review&quot;
*Otto Jespersen, philologist, University of Copenhagen
*Spyridon Lambros, University of Athens
*Constantin Le Paige, University of Liege
*Wilhelm Ostwald, University of Leipzig, future Nobel Prize winner (chemistry)
*Hugo Schuchardt, University of Graz.

The committee heard from representatives of language projects, including Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano in support of his own Latino sine flexione. Esperanto was represented by Louis de Beaufront, an active supporter of the language. Other languages, such as Bolak, Spokil and Idiom Neutral received the attention of the committee.

Towards the end of the Committee&#x27;s meeting, committee members received a proposal by an anonymous author identified as &quot;Ido&quot; (I.D. in Esperanto, possibly for &quot;Internacia Delegacio&quot; International Delegation, but also meaning &quot;offspring&quot; in Esperanto). The proposal reformed Esperanto in a number of ways, including removing circumflexed letters, dropping the mandatory accusative ending and reforming the plural. The reforms were endorsed by Esperanto&#x27;s representative, de Beaufront.

The decision of the committee was to adopt Esperanto in principle, but with the reforms spelled out by Ido. A permanent commission was set up to see the implementation of the reforms. The anonymous &quot;Ido&quot;, author of the reform project, was later revealed to be Louis de Beaufront, acting in concert with Louis Couturat.

==Aftermath==

The commission delivered an ultimatum to the Esperanto Language Committee, the nearest approximate to a governing body of the Esperanto movement at the time. A response was demanded in one month, but this was logistically impossible as members of the Language Committee spread out all over Europe and beyond. After a month passed with no response, the commission broke relations with the Esperantists.

A number of Esperantists did migrate to the movement, including a number of influential leaders of the movement, but most ordinary speakers did not support the Ido reforms. This prompted the observation from outsiders that the Idists were generals without an army, and the Esperantists were an army with no generals. Less than a year later, the Universala Esperanto-Asocio was created to provide stronger leadership within the Esperanto movement, which had not received organizational guidance from its inventor, Dr. Zamenhof. While Esperantists have little regard for the Delegation and its decisions, partisans of Ido continue to insist that the Delegation Committee was legitimate. The Ido language even today still has a following.

The Encyclopedia of Esperanto summarizes the Esperantists&#x27; position as follows:

:&quot;La &quot;Delegitaro&quot; estis unu-homa afero, sen kunvenoj aŭ difinita regularo. La unu klara regulo, ke aŭtoroj de lingvoprojekto ne rajtas partopreni, estis rompita. El la 12 membroj de la komitato nur du estis lingvistoj, kaj nur 4 partoprenis; oni aldonis nomojn de anstataŭantoj aŭ novaj membroj sen rajtigo. La fina rezolucio estis voĉdonita de nur tri el la 12 plus 4 anstataŭantaj kaj la sekretarioj. Oni sendis al la L. K. 25 kopiojn de la projekto, por disdoni ilin inter 100 membroj de la L. K. (loĝantaj ankaŭ ekster Eŭropo) kaj postulis respondon post unu monato.&quot;

:The &quot;Delegation&quot; was a one-man enterprise, without meetings or a definitive set of rules. The one clear rule, that authors of language projects have no right to participate, was broken. Of the 12 members of the committee, only two were linguists, and only four participated; they added names of substitutes or new members without permission. The final resolution was voted upon by only three of the twelve plus four substitutes and the secretaries. They sent to the L.K. (Esperanto Language Committee) 25 copies of the project, to distribute among its 100 members (some of whom were living outside of Europe) and demanded a response in one month.

<text>Karen Eliot is a multiple identity, a shared pen name that anyone is welcome to use for activist and artistic endeavours. It is a manifestation of the &quot;open pop star&quot; idea within the Neoist movement. The name was developed in order to counter the male domination of that movement, the most predominant multiple-use names previously being Monty Cantsin and Luther Blissett.

The experimental composers and artists David Chokroun, Aydem Azmikara, André Éric Létourneau, Marc Couroux, Engram Knots, and Vanessa Grey have used &quot;Karen Eliot&quot; to collectively and anonymously write musical compositions during and throughout their lifetimes. According to writer Eldritch Priest, as a composer &quot;Karen Eliot belongs to nobody and is no &quot;one&quot;...the collective nature and schematic indirection of &#x27;Karen Eliot&#x27; circulates her contradictions and inconsistencies in a way that keeps doubt and the status of her reality in play.&quot; Many of André Éric Létourneau&#x27;s radio-art works are also signed by Karen Eliot.

==History of multiple-use names==
These multiple names were developed and popularized in artistic subcultures of the 1970s to 1990s like Mail Art, Neoism and post-Situationist discourse, with the pseudonym Rrose Sélavy – jointly used by Dada artist Marcel Duchamp and the surrealist poet Robert Desnos – forming a historical precedent, as did the poetry of Taliesin. The political references go back much further, for instance to Ned Ludd.

In the 1960s underground culture the multiple name Emmett Grogan was adopted by San Francisco Diggers. In the 1970s the multiple name Wally was adopted by The Wallies of Wessex, a group of squatters in and around Stonehenge.

<text>Marjorie Ellen Mahoney Dusay (; née Mahoney; February 20, 1936 – January 28, 2020) was an American actress known for her roles on American soap operas. She was especially known for her role as Alexandra Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a role she played on and off from 1993 through the show&#x27;s 2009 cancellation, as well as Jean Faircloth, the wife of Douglas MacArthur, in the 1977 movie &quot;MacArthur&quot;.

==Career==
In 1967, Kansas native Dusay was a member of the Session, an improvisational comedy group in Los Angeles, formed by Rob Reiner. One member of the Session was Richard Dreyfuss. 

Dusay started her career with a small role as a waitress alongside Elvis Presley in the film &quot;Clambake&quot; in 1967. 
She appeared on December 21, 1967, in an episode of television&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot;. Dusay also appeared in &quot;Sweet November&quot; (1968).

Dusay&#x27;s early career focused on appearances in episodic television programs, including &quot;Get Smart, The Wild, Wild West, Bonanza, The Mod Squad, Love, American Style, The F.B.I., Mannix, The Bionic Woman,&quot; and &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; She appeared on &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; in its 1969 episode &quot;Benvenuto... Who?&quot; as a beautiful French diamond thief named Eugenie. In 1968, Dusay played a special agent in the TV series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, in an episode titled &quot;Twenty-Four Karat Kill&quot;. In 1969, Dusay played a woman who agrees to testify against a mobster in &quot;The Singapore File&quot;, as well as appearing three times as seductive temptresses on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. In 1968-69 she played Gloria in the CBS comedy &quot;Blondie&quot;.

Notable roles include her performance as alien Kara in &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot;, the first episode of season three of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In it, Dusay delivered arguably one of the most memorable lines of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;: &quot;Brain and brain — what is brain?!&quot; She was a popular guest at &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan conventions, often appearing with personal friend and fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor Michael Dante.

She starred as Jean MacArthur in the 1977 film &quot;MacArthur&quot;, and guest-starred as Blair Warner&#x27;s mother, Monica Warner, on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. Dusay would appear on &quot;Facts&quot; on a recurring basis over the course of the show&#x27;s run. In 1982, she appeared as Kate Hanrahan, a madam/con artist, in several episodes of &quot;Bret Maverick&quot;, in 1982-1983, she portrayed Beverly Tepperman in &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, and in 1979 she was Jennifer in &quot;Stop Susan Williams&quot;.

Summer 1999, Dusay starred in Andrew Repasky McElhinney&#x27;s period art-slasher film, &quot;A Chronicle of Corpses&quot; (released 2001). The film made a &quot;festival splash&quot; and was praised by Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as belonging &quot;to the small but significant tradition of outsider art in American movies - films like Herk Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; or George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; - that reflect powerful personalities formed outside any academic or professional tradition.” Dusay was praised for her performance as &quot;Grandmother Elliot&quot; in &quot;A Chronicle of Corpses&quot; which culminates in a &quot;tour de force&quot; seven-minute monologue for her character. She received uniformly good notices and several acting awards for her work in &quot;A Chronicle of Corpses&quot; the including winning the prestigious Silver Unicorn for Best Actor (&quot;Unicornio de plata a la mejor Interpretación&quot; — the highest acting honor) at The 3rd Annual Estepona Fantastic Film Festival (held in Spain 23–29 September 2002). &quot;A Chronicle of Corpses&quot; was named one of the Top Ten Movies of the Year by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and its original camera negative is in the permanent collection of MoMA - The Museum of Modern Art (New York). On the occasion of her death, &quot;Film International&quot; published a fond remembrance of Marj Dusay by &quot;A Chronicle of Corpses&quot; writer/director McElhinney.

=== Daytime ===
Dusay made her soap debut in April 1983, replacing Carolyn Jones as the powerful Washington, DC, matriarch Myrna Clegg on &quot;Capitol&quot;, which she played through the final episode in March 1987. As the rival of the kindly Clarissa McCandless (Constance Towers), she had a part in practically every storyline, as well as a steady leading man in veteran film actor Richard Egan. Dusay received two Supporting Actress &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; nominations for this part.

She then took over for Shirley Anne Field as the troubled Pamela Pepperidge Capwell Conrad on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1987–88 and in 1991. As C.C. Capwell&#x27;s first wife and Mason Capwell&#x27;s mother, she also became the mother-in-law to Mason&#x27;s half-sister, Kelly, who married Pamela&#x27;s other son, Jeffrey Conrad. A brief affair with C.C. ended badly, causing Pamela to go insane and try to kill Kelly. Her 1991 return had Pamela seemingly recovered, but quickly slipping back into insanity when Mason took her to C.C.&#x27;s for a surprise dinner. 

In 1993, Dusay briefly filled in for Louise Sorel as Vivian Alamain on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; while Sorel was on medical leave. After a nationwide search for an actress to take over for the enormously popular Beverlee McKinsey as Alexandra Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, Dusay was cast in the role and began airing in August 1993, remaining on the show until March 1997. She returned for a brief stint from November 1998 to February 1999. 

Dusay originated the role of Vanessa Bennett on &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1999, a role she played until 2002. As the mother of Dr. David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry, her co-star from &quot;Guiding Light&quot;) and Leo DuPres (Josh Duhamel), she also became Palmer Cortlandt&#x27;s last wife, playing opposite James Mitchell. Dusay then once again returned to the role of Alexandra on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, this time replacing Joan Collins, who left three months into a six-month contract. 

In late May 2005, Dusay was one of several cast members taken off contract due to budget cuts. Dusay continued to make recurring appearances on the show. Dusay played a 2006 storyline where Alexandra married younger man Cyrus Foley (Murray Bartlett) to keep Cyrus in the country - while scheming to keep him out of a younger woman&#x27;s bed. While Dusay&#x27;s appearances were greatly reduced after this storyline ended, she did appear in the show&#x27;s final year, opposite Grant Aleksander, who played her onscreen nephew Philip Spaulding. CBS announced the cancellation of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on April 1, 2009, and the final show aired on September 18, 2009. Dusay appeared as Alexandra during the final week of the show. Alexandra attended her brother&#x27;s funeral and had a &quot;happy ending&quot; of sorts when she reunited with former romantic partner Fletcher Reade.

==Personal life==
In 1955, she married John Dusay, a physician. They had a son, Randy, and a daughter, Debra, who is an actress. The marriage ended in divorce in 1962. In 1967, she married Thomas Perine, who died in 1987. Randy Dusay died in 1993 from AIDS. 

Beginning in 1984, Dusay sponsored the Marj Dusay Celebrity Golf Tournament in Russell, Kansas. The event was designated as a fundraiser for the Kansas Child Abuse Prevention Centers and for establishing a statewide hotline.

On January 28, 2020, Dusay died at age 83 in Manhattan, New York.

<text>Hale is a village and electoral ward within the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. It lies about southwest of the city of Manchester, and is contiguous with the southeast of Altrincham. The population of the built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics at the 2021 census was 16,715. 

==History==
The toponym &quot;Hale&quot; derives from the Old English &quot;halh&quot;, meaning a nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area that has natural features that provide shelter. The name Hale occurs in a number of places throughout Britain.

The oldest record of Hale is in the Domesday Book of 1086. However, what little evidence there is – in the form of etymology and a few surviving records of events in the area – points to Saxons settling the area in the 7th century. The Domesday Book records that in the reign of Edward the Confessor in the mid-11th century a Saxon thegn, Ælfward, held the manor of Hale, and after the Norman Conquest of England his lands were held by the Norman Hamon de Massey who also gained Dunham and Bowdon. The Massey family remained barons of this area until the mid-14th century, due to the extinction of the Massey line. A this time Hale was divided between the Booths of Dunham – the family that became the Earls of Stamford – and two other owners. Throughout this period the area around Hale was mainly agricultural.

Hale expanded and prospered over throughout the Middle Ages to the extent that by the middle of the 15th century a tithe barn had been established in Hale Barns – the value of the tithe taken from Hale was more than double that of any other township in the Bowdon parish. The growth of Hale resulted in the establishment of Hale Barns as a separate settlement to the east. Previously Hale Barns had merely been an isolated extension of the main settlement of Hale, but the first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns is in documentation from 1616.

The Cheshire Midland Railway (later the Cheshire Lines Committee) opened from Altrincham to Knutsford on 22 May 1862 with a station in Hale named Peel Causeway. It was the arrival of the railway in Hale in the mid-19th century that prompted the change from an agricultural village to a commuter area for middle class merchants working in the city. The station was renamed Hale in 1902.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Hale, at metropolitan borough level: Trafford Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. For national elections, Hale forms part of the Altrincham and Sale West constituency.

===Administrative history===

Hale was historically a township in the ancient parish of Bowdon, which formed part of the Bucklow Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Bowdon, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Hale became a civil parish.

When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, Hale was given a parish council and included in the Bucklow Rural District. In 1900, the parish was converted into an urban district, with the exception of the more rural eastern part of the parish which was separated from Hale to become a new parish called Ringway.

Hale Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester.

==Geography==
Hale is southeast of Altrincham with the villages of Hale Barns and Bowdon to the east and west respectively. Hale is bounded by the River Bollin to the south and Altrincham Golf Course to the north. The local geology consists of sand and gravel deposited in the last ice age. In common with much of Cheshire, the bedrock of Hale is mainly sandstone.

==Demography==
According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Hale had a population of 15,315. The 2001 population density was 2,847 per km², with a 100 to 96.6 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 25.5% were single (never married) and 56.2% married. Hale&#x27;s 6,198 households included 26.0% one-person, 45.8% married couples living together, 5.3% were co-habiting couples, and 5.6% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 13.7% had no academic qualifications, significantly lower than the averages of Trafford (24.7%) and England (28.9%).

In 1931, 26.4% of Hale&#x27;s population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 56.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this doubling of the middle classes in Hale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 14.9% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 10.6% in Hale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. This shows that Hale is an affluent suburb, alongside neighbouring Bowdon. Hale was named by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as the 12th most expensive place in Britain with house prices 194% higher than those in surrounding areas and having increased by 78% since 2003.

===Population change===
==Economy==

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents aged 16–74 was 24.7% property and business services, 14.5% retail and wholesale, 12.1% health and social work, 10.7% manufacturing, 9.9% education, 6.3% transport and communications, 4.6% finance, 4.1% construction, 3.6% hotels and restaurants, 3.3% public administration, 0.6% agriculture, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.1% mining, and 5.0% other. Compared with national figures, Hale had a relatively high percentage of residents working in property, and a relatively low percentage working in agriculture, public administration, and manufacturing. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 1.7% students were with jobs, 4.6% students without jobs, 7.3% looking after home or family, 2.5% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.2% economically inactive for other reasons. The 1.6% unemployment rate of Hale was low compared with the national rate of 3.3%, and the proportion of people who were self-employed was significantly higher than the national average of 8.3.

==Religion==
At the 2001 UK census, 71.2% of Hale&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 6.9% Jewish, 3.1% Muslim, 1.2% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, and 0.1% Sikh. The census recorded 10.9% as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 6.3% did not state their religion.

===Christian landmarks===
St. Peter&#x27;s Church of England church was built in 1892 and is a fine example of late Victorian architecture. Hale Chapel was established in Hale Barns by Nonconformists in 1723 on what is now Chapel Lane. It underwent alterations around 1880. The Chapel is the earliest place of worship in either Hale or Hale Barns and is a Grade II* listed building. It also features an eighteenth-century pulpit and nineteenth-century stained glass.

===Jewish landmarks===
The Hale &amp; District Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1976. Having started in a flat, the community moved to their current synagogue on Shay Lane in 1978. The move was necessary due to increasing attendance. The original Shule and Community Centre building in Hale served its members for 20 years until the community outgrew its facilities. In 2002, a rebuilding project was launched, forcing the congregation to hold its services in a tent in a neighbouring field for 16 months, until the new Hale Shule and P.J. Davis Community Centre was consecrated and opened in March 2003. A Sephardi synagogue is also undergoing construction, and is due to be open later this year or in early 2015.

===Muslim landmarks===
In July 2003 the former St David&#x27;s Church on Grove Lane, Hale was converted it into a Mosque by the Altrincham Muslim Association. The Mosque serves the Muslim community of Hale and families who live in the outlying areas of Lymm, Mobberley, Bucklow Hill, Mere and Knutsford.

==Transport==

Hale is near the transport interchange in Altrincham and has regular bus services to Hale and Hale Barns. The village is also west of Manchester Airport. Hale railway station, in the centre of Hale, is on the Mid-Cheshire Line between Chester and Manchester.

==Landmarks and culture==
Royd House is situated on Hale Road. The house was designed by architect Edgar Wood and built for himself as his home. It is regarded as one of the most advanced examples of early-20th century domestic architecture and is referenced in a number of architectural digests. Royd House is a Grade I listed building.

Hale Library is situated in Leigh Road. The centre of Hale village has a bowling green. A crown green bowling green is attached the Bull&#x27;s Head public house in Hale Barns. There are many parks, including Stamford Park named after Earl of Stamford, who lived at Dunham Massey.

<doc id="1065009" wikidata="Q1474679" url="?curid=1065009" title="Smart material">
<text>Smart materials, also called intelligent or responsive materials, are designed materials that have one or more properties that can be significantly changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli, such as stress, moisture, electric or magnetic fields, light, temperature, pH, or chemical compounds. Smart materials are the basis of many applications, including sensors and actuators, or artificial muscles, particularly as electroactive polymers (EAPs).

==Types==

There are a number of types of smart material, of which are already common. Some examples are as following:
* Piezoelectric materials are materials that produce a voltage when stress is applied. Since this effect also applies in a reverse manner, a voltage across the sample will produce stress within sample. Suitably designed structures made from these materials can, therefore, be made that bend, expand or contract when a voltage is applied.
*Shape-memory alloys and shape-memory polymers are materials in which large deformation can be induced and recovered through temperature changes or stress changes (pseudoelasticity). The shape memory effect results due to respectively martensitic phase change and induced elasticity at higher temperatures.
* Photovoltaic materials or optoelectronics convert light to electrical current.
* Electroactive polymers (EAPs) change their volume by voltage or electric fields. 
* Magnetostrictive materials exhibit a change in shape under the influence of magnetic field and also exhibit a change in their magnetization under the influence of mechanical stress.
* Magnetic shape memory alloys are materials that change their shape in response to a significant change in the magnetic field.
* Smart inorganic polymers showing tunable and responsive properties.
* pH-sensitive polymers are materials that change in volume when the pH of the surrounding medium changes. 
* Temperature-responsive polymers are materials which undergo changes upon temperature.
* Halochromic materials are commonly used materials that change their color as a result of changing acidity. One suggested application is for paints that can change color to indicate corrosion in the metal underneath them.
* Chromogenic systems change color in response to electrical, optical or thermal changes. These include electrochromic materials, which change their colour or opacity on the application of a voltage (e.g., liquid crystal displays), thermochromic materials change in colour depending on their temperature, and photochromic materials, which change colour in response to light—for example, light-sensitive sunglasses that darken when exposed to bright sunlight.
* Ferrofluids are magnetic fluids (affected by magnets and magnetic fields).
* Photomechanical materials change shape under exposure to light.
* Polycaprolactone (polymorph) can be molded by immersion in hot water.
* Self-healing materials have the intrinsic ability to repair damage due to normal usage, thus expanding the material&#x27;s lifetime.
* Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are smart material systems which produce large strains (up to 500%) under the influence of an external electric field.
* Magnetocaloric materials are compounds that undergo a reversible change in temperature upon exposure to a changing magnetic field.
* Thermoelectric materials are used to build devices that convert temperature differences into electricity and vice versa.
* Chemoresponsive materials change size or volume under the influence of external chemical or biological compound.

<text>Ernst Franz Sedgwick Hanfstaengl (; 2 February 1887 – 6 November 1975) was a German American businessman and close friend of Adolf Hitler. He eventually fell out of favour with Hitler and defected from Nazi Germany to the United States. He later worked for Franklin D. Roosevelt and was once engaged to the author Djuna Barnes.

==Early life and education==
Hanfstaengl, nicknamed &quot;Putzi&quot;, was born in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, the son of a German art publisher, Edgar Hanfstaengl, and an American mother. He spent most of his early years in Germany and later moved to the United States. His mother was Katharine Wilhelmina Heine, daughter of Wilhelm Heine, a cousin of American Civil War Union Army general John Sedgwick. His godfather was Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He had an elder sister, Erna, two elder brothers Edgar and Egon, and a younger brother Erwine.

He attended Harvard College and became acquainted with Walter Lippmann and John Reed. A gifted pianist, he composed several songs for Harvard&#x27;s football team. He graduated in 1909.

He moved to New York City, where he took over the management of the American branch of his father&#x27;s business, the Franz Hanfstaengl Fine Arts Publishing House. Many mornings he would practice on the piano at the Harvard Club of New York City, where he became acquainted with both Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt. Among his circle of acquaintances were the newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst, author Djuna Barnes, to whom he was engaged, and actor Charlie Chaplin.

At the outbreak of World War I, he asked the German military attaché in New York City, Franz von Papen, to smuggle him back to Germany. Slightly baffled by the proposal, the attaché refused, and Hanfstaengl remained in the U.S. during the war. After 1917, the American branch of the family business was confiscated as enemy property.

==Career==

===Admirer and confidant of Hitler===
Hanfstaengl returned to Germany in 1922. While living in his native Bavaria, he first heard Adolf Hitler speak in a Munich beer hall. A fellow member of the Harvard&#x27;s Hasty Pudding club who worked at the U.S. Embassy asked Hanfstaengl to assist a military attaché sent to observe the political scene in Munich. Just before returning to Berlin, the attaché, Captain Truman Smith, suggested that Hanfstaengl go to a Nazi rally as a favor and report his impressions of Hitler. Hanfstaengl was so fascinated by Hitler that he soon became one of his most intimate followers, although he did not formally join the Nazi Party until 1931. &quot;What Hitler was able to do to a crowd in 2½ hours will never be repeated in 10,000 years,&quot; Hanfstaengl said. &quot;Because of his miraculous throat construction, he was able to create a rhapsody of hysteria. In time, he became the living unknown soldier of Germany.&quot;

Hanfstaengl introduced himself to Hitler after the speech and began a close friendship and political association that would last through the 1920s and early 1930s. After participating in the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Hanfstaengl briefly fled to Austria, while the injured Hitler sought refuge in Hanfstaengl&#x27;s home in Uffing, outside Munich. Hanfstaengl&#x27;s wife, Helene, allegedly dissuaded Hitler from committing suicide when the police came to arrest him.

For much of the 1920s, Hanfstaengl introduced Hitler to Munich high society and helped polish his image. He also helped to finance the publication of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and the NSDAP&#x27;s official newspaper, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (People&#x27;s Observer). Hitler was the godfather of Hanfstaengl&#x27;s son Egon. Hanfstaengl composed both Brownshirt and Hitler Youth marches patterned after his Harvard football songs and, he later claimed, devised the chant &quot;Sieg Heil&quot;. Included among Hanfstaengl&#x27;s friends during this period were Hanns Heinz Ewers and fellow Nazi Party worker and journalist Kurt Lüdecke.

When Winston Churchill was staying at the Hotel Regina in Munich in late August 1932, Hanfstaengl introduced himself and said he could easily arrange a meeting with Hitler there since he came to the hotel every evening around five o&#x27;clock. At the time, Churchill said he had no national prejudices against Hitler and knew little of his &quot;doctrine or record and nothing of his character.&quot; 

In the course of the conversation with Hanfstaengl, Churchill asked, &quot;Why is your chief so violent about the Jews? I can quite understand being angry with the Jews who have done wrong or who are against the country, and I understand resisting them if they try to monopolise power in any walk of life; but what is the sense of being against a man because of his birth? How can a man help how he is born?&quot; Hanfstaengl, according to Churchill, must have relayed this to Hitler because the next day, around noon, he came to the hotel to tell Churchill that Hitler would not be coming to see him after all. In addition, Hitler may not have wanted to meet with Churchill, who was then not in power and thought to be of no importance. Churchill declined to meet with Hitler on several subsequent occasions.

During the Reichstag fire, Hanfstaengl was staying at Göring&#x27;s official residence, noticed the fire, and alerted members of the Nazi Party.

===Fall from power===
As the Nazi Party consolidated its power, several disputes arose between Hanfstaengl and Germany&#x27;s Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels. In 1933, Hanfstaengl was removed from Hitler&#x27;s staff. He and Helene divorced in 1936. Hanfstaengl fell completely out of Hitler&#x27;s favour after he was denounced by Unity Mitford, a close friend of both the Hanfstaengls and Hitler.

In 1937, Hanfstaengl received orders to parachute into an area held by the nationalist side of the Spanish Civil War, to assist in negotiations. While on board the plane he feared a plot on his life and learned more details from the pilot about the mission, who eventually admitted he had been ordered to drop Hanfstaengl over Republican-held territory, which would have meant almost certain death. The pilot eventually landed on a small airfield near Leipzig after claiming an engine malfunction following a brief talk with Hanfstaengl, which allowed him to escape.

That version of the story was related by Albert Speer in his memoirs, who said that the &quot;mission&quot; to Spain was an elaborate practical joke, concocted by Hitler and Goebbels, designed to punish Hanfstaengl after he had displeased the Führer by making &quot;adverse comments about the fighting spirit of the German soldiers in combat&quot; during the Spanish Civil War. Hanfstaengl was issued sealed orders which were not to be opened until his plane was in flight, which specified that he was to be dropped in &quot;Red Spanish territory&quot; to work as an agent for Francisco Franco. The plane, according to Speer, was merely circling over Germany containing an increasingly disconcerted Hanfstaengl, with false location reports being given to convey the impression that the plane was drawing ever closer to Spain. After the joke had played itself out, the pilot declared he had to make an emergency landing and landed safely at Leipzig Airport. Hanfstaengl was so alarmed by the event that he defected soon afterward.

In a late 1960s interview at his home in Schwabing in Munich, Hanfstaengl said that he was convinced he was to be tossed out of the plane and parachute over northern Germany.

===Imprisonment===
He made his way to Switzerland and, after securing his son Egon&#x27;s release from Germany, he moved to Great Britain, where he was imprisoned after the outbreak of World War II. He was later moved to a prison camp in Canada. 

===Cooperation with United States===
In 1942, Hanfstaengl was turned over to the U.S., worked for U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;S-Project&quot; and revealed information on approximately 400 Nazi leaders. He provided 68 pages of information on Hitler alone, including personal details of Hitler&#x27;s private life. In 1943, he helped Henry Murray, the director of Harvard University&#x27;s psychological clinic, Walter Charles Langer, a psychoanalyst, and other experts create a report for the Office of Strategic Services, titled &quot;Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler&quot;. 

In 1944, Hanfstaengl was handed back to the British, who repatriated him to Germany at the end of World War II. William Shirer, a CBS journalist who resided in Nazi Germany until 1940 and was in frequent contact with Hanfstaengl, described him as an &quot;eccentric, gangling man, whose sardonic wit somewhat compensated for his shallow mind.&quot;

Hanfstaengl wrote &quot;Unheard Witness&quot; (1957), which was later re-released as &quot;Hitler: The Missing Years&quot;, about his experiences. In 1974, Hanfstaengl attended his 65th Harvard reunion, where he regaled the Harvard University Band about the authors of various Harvard fight songs.

==Personal life==
On 11 February 1920, Hanfstaengl married Helene Elise Adelheid Niemeyer of Long Island. Their only son, Egon Ludwig, eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps. A daughter, Hertha, died at the age of five.

==Death==
Hanfstaengl died in Munich on 6 November 1975. In 2004, Peter Conradi authored a biography of Hanfstaengl, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Piano Player: The Rise and Fall of Ernst Hanfstaengl, Confidante of Hitler, Ally of FDR&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Hanfstaengl was portrayed by Liev Schreiber in the 2003 Canadian television miniseries &quot;&quot;. American actor Randy Quaid played him in the 1982 television film &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;. Ronald Pickup played him in the 1989 miniseries &quot;The Nightmare Years&quot;.
In the 1964 fiction novel, &quot;Herzog&quot;, written by &quot;Saul Bellow&quot;, a Putzi Hanfstaengl is mentioned as being Hitler&#x27;s personal pianist. This fact was confirmed by Hanfstaengl himself, who said in 1969 that he was able to soothe Hitler to sleep with his piano playing.

In his story &quot;The Sacred Grove&quot;, collected in &quot;While Rome Burns&quot;, Alexander Woollcott refers to an encounter with an uncooperative attendant in a New York picture store in 1916, whom he later identifies as Hanfstaengl.

In chapter 3 of “Munich Wolf” (2024) by Rory Clements, the fictional main character Detective Sebastian Wolff is introduced on page 20 to the non-fictional person of Ernst ‘Putzi’ Hanfstaengl.

<text>Benson &amp; Hedges is a British brand of cigarettes owned by American conglomerate Altria. Cigarettes under the &quot;Benson &amp; Hedges&quot; name are manufactured worldwide by different companies such as Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges, Philip Morris USA, British American Tobacco, or Japan Tobacco, depending on the region. In the UK, they are registered in Old Bond Street in London, and were manufactured in Lisnafillan, Ballymena, Northern Ireland, before production was moved to Eastern Europe in 2017.

They are predominantly made from Virginia tobacco.

==History==

Benson &amp; Hedges was founded in London in 1873 by Richard Benson and William Hedges as Benson and Hedges Ltd. Alfred Paget Hedges succeeded his father in the business in 1885, the same year which Richard Benson left the business. The 1900s saw branches of Benson &amp; Hedges Ltd. opening in the United States and Canada. In 1928, the American branch became independent, and was bought by Philip Morris in 1958. Benson &amp; Hedges Ltd in the UK was acquired by the Gallaher Group in 1955.

A Royal Warrant was issued to the British company in 1878, after the required five years of supply to the Royal Family. It was revoked in 1999 due to a &quot;lack of demand in the royal households&quot;. The Warrant seal, which had previously been on the flip lid of the box, was removed.

== Spin-offs ==
In July 1968, Philip Morris released Virginia Slims which were a spin-off of Benson &amp; Hedges intended to be sold to women. They were sold during a period of time where society was beginning to realize the dangers of smoking. Therefore, they were a thinner and more &quot;elegant&quot; alternative to regular cigarettes.

==Sponsorships==

===Formula 1===
From to , the company was the primary sponsor of the Jordan Grand Prix team. When racing in countries with bans on tobacco advertising (such as the United Kingdom, France and later Germany, Belgium, Canada, United States, Italy, Turkey), the team used alternative liveries such as &quot;Bitten &amp; Hisses&quot;, &quot;Buzzin&#x27; Hornets&quot;, &quot;Bitten Heroes&quot; and &quot;Be on Edge&quot; to bypass the bans on cigarette advertising while still promoting their product.

===Australian Touring Car Championship===

Benson &amp; Hedges sponsored Tony Longhurst&#x27;s team in the 1980s and early 1990s in Australian Touring Car racing. All sponsorships ceased when 1996 federal government legislation banned tobacco advertising at sporting events.

===Ice skating===
Benson &amp; Hedges sponsored a touring ice show, &quot;Benson &amp; Hedges on Ice&quot;, in the late 1980s.

===Cricket===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the company was a major sponsor of international cricket, with naming rights for Test Cricket with the home Australia tests and most of the one-day international tournaments held in Australia including the World Series Cup, the World Championship of Cricket held in 1985 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Victoria and the 1992 Cricket World Cup held by Australia and New Zealand and the English County one day cup competition the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. The Australian sponsorship ended in 1996 due to the Federal Governments ban on tobacco advertising while the sponsorship in England carried on until 2002 when the UK Government banned tobacco sponsorship which led to the English competition to be replaced by the T20 Cup now known as the T20 Blast.

===Other===
Benson &amp; Hedges was a big sponsor of the iD Dunedin Fashion Week in New Zealand from the 1940s until 1995, around the time tobacco sponsorship was banned completely. The Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 was already in force in 1990 which restricted smoking in offices, the public parts of workplaces, and in public and eating places and transport; banned advertising of tobacco products, tobacco sponsorship, and tobacco advertising on other goods, and established a health sponsorship council. Before that however, Benson &amp; Hedges sponsored the fashion week by awarding their tickets in gold cigarette box-inspired packaging and by allowing the women to pick various novelty items and cigarette accessories.

Benson &amp; Hedges sponsored the &quot;Symphony of Fire&quot; fireworks competitions in Montreal, Quebec, Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia, until tobacco advertising laws passed by the Government of Canada came into force in 2000. Also, on 29 November 2000, Benson &amp; Hedges pulled their sponsorship of the Toronto International Film Festival as a response to the new federal legislation that would come into effect in October 2003 that eliminated tobacco companies&#x27; ability to sponsor events and the arts. 

Benson &amp; Hedges sponsored the movie &quot;B&amp;H Golden Dreams&quot; (next &quot;B&amp;H Gold &amp; Dreams&quot;) and &quot;B&amp;H Golden Dreams Extreme&quot; on TV3 in the 1990s.

==Controversy==
===Canadian class-action lawsuit===
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada, JTI-Macdonald Corp, and Rothmans Benson &amp; Hedges, were the subject of the largest class-action lawsuit in Canadian history, brought by current and former smokers. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies faced a potential payout of C$27 billion (US$27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.

On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan had awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.

==Markets==
The cigarettes are available in Gold or Silver forms, and in some countries also as Red, Green (Menthol), Blue, White and Black. Japan Tobacco also manufactures Hamlet cigars.

In the United States, the brand is owned by Philip Morris USA and available varieties include Kings (box), Menthol (box), Multifilter Kings (soft pack), DeLuxe (box), DeLuxe Menthol (box), Luxury, and Luxury Menthol (soft pack or box). Beginning in 1967, US television ads for the Benson and Hedges brand featured a musical theme (written by Mitch Leigh) called &quot;The Disadvantages Of You;&quot; of which an adapted version charted briefly for a group called The Brass Ring. The commercials humorously depicted various &quot;disadvantages&quot; encountered by smokers struggling to adapt to the unusual length of Benson and Hedges 100s, which were &quot;longer than king-size, at the same price as king-size&quot;. These commercials ran until cigarette advertising was banned on US television in 1971. The related print advertising campaign ran for several years afterward.

The brand was or still is sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Ceuta and Melilla, Italy, Cyprus, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya, South Africa, Seychelles, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Canada, United States, Mexico, Jamaica, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Croatia .

===UK market===

In the 1980s, the company&#x27;s products were advertised in a series of posters and cinema films which featured the gold pack in various surreal juxtapositions and transformations, devoid of words and people. 
In 2001, brand was changed from Special Filter to Gold, and a Silver version was introduced, with reduced tar content and 0.1 mg less nicotine, at a slightly cheaper price. In 2008, a 14 cigarette pack was launched, alongside existing 10 and 20 packs. In July 2009, a Gold and Silver versions of rolling tobacco were launched. , the company&#x27;s UK brands were Gold, Silver, White and Gold Superkings, and rolling tobacco. Discontinued former brands in the UK have included: Sovereign, Gold Bond, Virginia Red, Virginia Blue, and Black.

In October 2012, a new cigarette called Benson and Hedges Dual was introduced. If the smoker prefers a menthol cigarette, they press the capsule inside of the filter and the cigarette goes from regular to a menthol tasting cigarette. In 2020, however, this cigarette was taken off the market due to the EU menthol cigarette ban.

===Overseas markets===
In the 1930s, Benson &amp; Hedges (Overseas) Ltd was established by Abraham Wix to handle international trade. This branch was acquired by British American Tobacco in 1956. Today, British American Tobacco markets Benson &amp; Hedges throughout Asia and the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand, but with the exception of Taiwan and the Philippines. The Canadian branch of Benson and Hedges is owned by Philip Morris International.

In Australia, the company&#x27;s cigarettes are available as Classic 25s, Rich 25s, Smooth 20s, 25s, Subtle 25s, Fine 25s and Ultimate 25s, in the standard Australian plain packaging.

<doc id="1065039" wikidata="Q7683053" url="?curid=1065039" title="Tangley">
<text>Tangley is a village in the English county of Hampshire, north of the old market town of Andover and the village of Charlton, Hampshire.

Tangley Parish covers an area of and has just under 600 residents in three villages, Tangley, Wildhern and Hatherden and the hamlets of Charlton Down and Little Hatherden. It lies in the north west corner of Hampshire and most of it is an officially designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The houses are typical of the different kinds to be found in the area with the older ones being of flint and brick and chalk cob with thatched or tiled roofs.

A walk through the parish of Tangley takes one through woodland, downland and farmland. The villages are scattered over the chalklands south of the Hampshire downs, on high land which overlooks the Bourne valley to the north and the remains of Chute Forest to the west.

==History==
The name Tangley is Anglo-Saxon. The earliest reference, in 1174, calls it Tangelea, meaning a wood or clearing (leah) on a tongue, or perhaps tongues, of land. Tangelea 1175. Possibly &#x27;woodland clearing at the spits of land&#x27;. Old English tang + leah

In the sixteenth century the manor of Tangley was owned by the Reade family, whose most distinguished member was Sir Richard Reade (1511–1575), who served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland in the 1540s.

Tangley has a War Memorial dedicated to those who gave their lives in the Great War of 1914–1918.

Tangley has become famous for the devastating fire that consumed its manor house, and resulted in the deaths of MP Michael Colvin and his wife in February 2000.

The small Victorian church of St Thomas is surrounded by its old graveyard with ancient yew trees. People have prayed here for centuries and three sarsen stones remain, as possible evidence there was pagan worship there before Christian times.

==Landmarks==
Tangley was the last point for the drovers who walked their sheep over the downs to the Weyhill Fair in October each year. Tangley offered refreshments and lodging to the drovers, and their flocks in the form of five inns or beer houses, of which two remained until recently – The Fox to the south and The Cricketer&#x27;s in the centre of the village.
*Cricketers Arms
*The Fox Inn

The Cricketer&#x27;s is now closed.

Tangley Parish Hall, which was rebuilt in 1959, is situated in the peaceful village of Wildhern. It lies on a -acre site which is in a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.

<doc id="1065042" wikidata="Q2672465" url="?curid=1065042" title="Dołęga coat of arms">
<text>Dołęga (pronunciation: ) is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==Blazon==
&quot;&quot;Azure&quot;, a downward opened horse-shoe &quot;argent&quot; with a cross former of the same charged on the edge of its arch. Inside the horse-shoe an &quot;argent&quot; arrow whose downward point protrudes. Helmet with mantling &quot;azure&quot;, lined &quot;argent&quot;. Crowned. Crest: a vulture&#x27;s wing with an &quot;argent&quot; arrow shot through.&quot;
There are four varieties of the coat of arms of which one is shown on RHS of top of the page.
==History==
This coat-of-arms appears in 1345, as the seal of Mysliborz, a Judge of Dobrzyn (Dobrzyń nad Wisłą).

In a 1373 manuscript of Jan, the Bishop of Płock, the village of Łeg is first mentioned as a Dołęga Clan possession.

It is surrounded by villages once owned by Dołęga Clan families. These are: Dabrowa, Dziedzice, Grabow, Gzino, Koskowo, Luzniewo, Mlice, Osiek, Ossowa, Zakrzewo, Zalesie, and others, owned respectively by the Dabrowski, Dziedzicki, Grabowski, Gzinski, Koskowski, Luzniewski, Mlicki, Osiecki, Ossowski, Zakrzewski, and Zaleski families etc. These villages and Płock are in the Masovian region of east Poland.

In 1413 the Act of Horodlo Union the Dołęga crest was transferred to Lithuania. Many of the clan families emigrating at the beginning of the seventeenth century migrated to Lithuania. Some settled in the parish areas of Vilnius, given land and properties from Russians who were either killed or exiled.

A court record of 1373 describes the war cry as &quot;Do Langa&quot;. In records after 1400 the two words merge as &quot;Dolanga,&quot; then more recently as Dołęga. &quot;Do łęga&quot; means &quot;To Łeg!&quot; and perhaps served as a rallying point in times of conflict, or for the local clan celebrations.

Others say Dołęga means &quot;To Bows&quot; a cry to arms as the enemy approached. Another source says the word Dołęga in old Polish, meant - having great physical strength, forcefulness.
The coat was born in Poland in King Boleslaw Krzywousty&#x27;s (1102–1139) war against the Prussians. While defending a castle under siege, Polish knights ambushed the Prussian army. A knight named Dołęga shot the hoof of the Prussian army commander&#x27;s horse with his crossbow so well that the Prussian commander was thrown from it. The Polish knights captured and executed him during the ambush. This inspired the Polish people to rise up and attack, and the Prussians were driven back by Polish sabers. Dołęga took an arrow in the appendix, but the battle was won. As a reward for his amazing shot, the King granted him a coat of arms after his name, Dołęga. The coat of arms he received depicts a raven wing, the heraldic symbol of loyalty and faith, and a horseshoe representing the horse hoof he shot.

There is a village named Prusy which ostensibly for purposes of inheritance, was divided up among Dołęga Clan members. The name of this village may have given rise to the &#x27;myth&#x27;, that at one time, Dołęga clansmen might have defeated and captured Prussian (Baltic-speaking) enemies, and reduced them to serfs on their various properties.

Also there is a village called Dołęga in Małopolskie district of southern Poland which has a well-preserved nineteenth-century szlachta noble manor house (now a museum) surrounded by a natural forest park, in which there is a small chapel built by the nobleman owner. It was quite common for the nobleman to provide money/men to build the village church or chapel depending on size and riches of the family.

In December 1990, the Ulanów City Council, Nisko County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, Southern Poland adopted Resolution No. X/54/90 on granting the Statute of the Municipality and the City Lancers in which it was given municipality and city coat of arms &quot;Dołęga&quot; in the image and shape of which used the city founder Stanislaw de Ulin Magna Uliński. The image of the coat of arms was placed on the building of the municipality and town in the national emblem as well as the seals and the Board of Municipal and Town.

<text>Michael Cole Mussina (born December 8, 1968), nicknamed &quot;Moose&quot;, is an American former baseball starting pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles (1991–2000) and the New York Yankees (2001–2008). In 2019, Mussina was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Mussina spent his entire career in the American League East, won at least 11 games in 17 consecutive seasons – an American League record – and recorded a career .638 winning percentage. Among pitchers, he ranks 23rd in strikeouts (2,813), and 23rd all-time in pitching Wins Above Replacement (82.9), 33rd in all-time wins (270), 33rd in games started (535), 66th in innings pitched (3,562.2). A five-time All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove winner, Mussina&#x27;s consistency resulted in six top-five finishes in the voting for his league&#x27;s Cy Young Award.

==Early life==
Mussina was born on December 8, 1968, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. At Montoursville Area High School in Montoursville, Pennsylvania he had a 24–4 win–loss record with a 0.87 earned run average (ERA) for the school&#x27;s baseball team. In the summer, he played for the Montoursville American Legion Baseball team. While playing baseball in college, he also played in the summertime for Jerseytown, Pennsylvania of the North Branch Baseball League of PA (NBBL).

Mussina also excelled in the sports of football and basketball as his records remain near the top of Montoursville High School&#x27;s all-time boys&#x27; basketball career scoring leaders with over 1,000 points scored. An outstanding placekicker, he received an offer to play college football from Penn State University head coach Joe Paterno, but he turned down the offer to focus on playing baseball. He also received a Division 1 college basketball scholarship offer from Vanderbilt University.

As a high school senior, Mussina just missed being the valedictorian of his graduating class. According to some reports, he intentionally came up short to avoid delivering a commencement speech.

Mussina was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 1987 but chose to attend college at Stanford University rather than sign.

==College career==
Mussina enrolled at Stanford University, where he played college baseball for the Stanford Cardinal baseball team. In three years with the Cardinal, Mussina compiled a 31–16 record with a 3.89 ERA. He made two College World Series appearances and was selected as an All-American. His junior year in 1990 was his best, finishing 14–5 with a 3.50 ERA over 149 innings, before being drafted again by the Baltimore Orioles, this time as a first round pick (20th overall).

Mussina graduated from Stanford in 1990 with a degree in economics. He is a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues===
Mussina made his professional debut with the Class AA Hagerstown Suns of the Eastern League in 1990. In the minor leagues, Mussina posted a 2.38 ERA in 189 innings.

===Baltimore Orioles (1991–2000)===

====1992–1995====
In 1992, Mussina&#x27;s first full season with the Orioles, he finished with an 18–5 record and a 2.54 ERA in 241 innings. His .783 win–loss percentage led the league, and his 1.79 BB/9 was second best behind Chris Bosio. His four shutouts were tied for second in the league behind only Boston&#x27;s Roger Clemens. He finished fourth in the American League Cy Young Award voting, and pitched one perfect inning in the 1992 All-Star Game.

 Mussina struggled in 1993 due to shoulder soreness, which placed him on the disabled list (DL) from July 22 to August 19. Nonetheless, he won 14 games while posting the seventh best winning percentage in the American League. Mussina also allowed 83 earned runs in only 167.2 innings of work for a 4.46 ERA while striking out 117 batters. He was voted onto the All-Star team, however he did not pitch in the game. There was a controversial incident toward the end of the game when Mussina chose to warm up in the bullpen, despite the fact AL manager Cito Gaston had told him that he would not enter the game. Orioles fans believed Mussina was warming up in preparation to come in and pitch the ninth inning, and when Gaston put Duane Ward in to pitch the ninth inning, the fans at Camden Yards spent the rest of the game chanting &quot;We Want Mike&quot; and booing Gaston very loudly, as the popular slogan &quot;Cito Sucks&quot; was born in Baltimore. The slogan could be seen on T-shirts or heard even years later in Baltimore any time the visiting Blue Jays came to town. Gaston was never treated well by Baltimore fans for the rest of his managerial career and he was subject to death threats for not pitching Mussina in the game. For his part, Mussina said he was just getting his work in, as he was scheduled to throw that day, and it was apparent Gaston did require his services. Mussina returned from the DL in August against the Texas Rangers, only to have the Orioles shut him down three weeks later in mid-September due to lower back pain.

Mussina returned to form in 1994, but a player&#x27;s strike cut his season short, causing him to finish with only 16 wins and 99 strikeouts in 176.1 innings of work. Mussina finished tied for second in the league in wins, and his 3.06 ERA placed him fourth. He was selected to his third consecutive All-Star Game and pitched one inning, giving up one hit while striking out one batter. Mussina finished fourth in voting for that year&#x27;s American League Cy Young Award.

In 1995, Mussina started and won Cal Ripken&#x27;s record-breaking 2,131st consecutive game on September 6, 1995.
Mussina led the league with 19 wins and had one of his finest statistical seasons. He struck out 158 batters in 221.2 innings, allowing only 81 earned runs for an ERA of 3.29. Mussina led the league with four shutouts, and he also allowed a league-low 2.03 BB/9, while his 1.069 WHIP was second only to Seattle&#x27;s Randy Johnson. Despite his excellent season, Mussina was not elected to that year&#x27;s All-Star Game, and finished fifth in the American League Cy Young Award voting.

====1996–2000====
In 1996, Mussina won 19 games and set a new career high of 243.1 innings. His league-leading 36 games started were also a career high. 18 of his starts that year were quality starts. In his last start of the season, the Orioles bullpen blew a late-inning lead, costing Mussina a 20-win season. Mussina also won his first Gold Glove that year.

Mussina did not start the Opening Day game in 1997 due to elbow tendonitis. He had been the Opening Day starter for the Orioles every year since 1993. Mussina finished the season with a 15–8 record, and his 3.20 ERA was fourth best in the league. In addition, his 218 strikeouts were a career high and established a franchise record. Mussina was again selected for the All-Star team but did not appear in the game. He finished sixth in the American League Cy Young Award voting and won his second consecutive Gold Glove. In the 1997 American League Championship Series he pitched 15 innings over two starts, allowing one run and four hits, and striking out 25—an ALCS record at the time. However, the Orioles failed to score in both of his starts, and Mussina ended up receiving no-decisions for each.

Mussina&#x27;s 1998 season was punctuated by two separate trips to the DL, including for injury resultant from when a ball hit by Sandy Alomar Jr. struck him on the face and fractured his nose. Mussina still won 13 games and post a 3.49 ERA, with 175 strikeouts in 206.1 innings. His strikeout-to-walk ratio was good for second in the league. Mussina won his third consecutive Gold Glove with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage out of 50 total chances. On April 11, Mussina struck out Detroit&#x27;s Bip Roberts for his 1,000th career strikeout.

In 1999, he finished second in the league with 18 wins, and his 3.50 ERA and .720 win–loss percentage were good for third. Mussina struck out 172 batters in 203.2 innings while walking just 52, for a 3.31 K/BB ratio. He was selected as an All-Star and pitched one inning. Mussina finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting that year behind Pedro Martínez. He committed just one error out of 61 total chances and won his fourth consecutive Gold Glove, further cementing his reputation as one of the top defensive pitchers in baseball.

In 2000, Mussina recorded his first and only losing season, going 11–15. However, he did not pitch as badly as his record suggests, as he allowed 100 earned runs in a league-leading 237.2 innings for a 3.79 ERA. He struck out 210 batters while allowing 44 walks. Opponents batted just .255 off him. He finished sixth in voting for the Cy Young Award that year.

===New York Yankees===
Following the 2000 season, Mussina decided to leave the Orioles via free agency. He signed a six-year, $88.5 million contract with the New York Yankees on November 30, 2000.

====2001–2004====
 Mussina finished the 2001 season with a 17–11 record. He was second in the league in ERA (3.15), strikeouts (214), shutouts (3), and strikeout/walk ratio (5.10), and fifth in strikeouts/9 IP (8.42) and complete games (4). Mussina pitched seven shutout innings in Game 3 of the 2001 American League Division Series and the Yankees went on to win the game 1–0, and eventually the series, becoming the only team to win a division series after losing the first two games at home. Mussina started Games 1 and 5 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, posting an 0–1 record with a 4.09 ERA in 11 innings pitched.

In 2002, Mussina was second in the AL in walks/9 IP (1.65), third in strikeouts (182) and strikeouts/9 IP (7.60), eighth in wins (18), and ninth in walks/9 IP (2.00). He held batters to a .198 batting average when the game was tied.

In 2003, Mussina was third in the league in strikeouts/9 IP (8.18) and strikeout/walk ratio (4.88), fourth in strikeouts (195) and walks/9 IP (1.68), fifth in wins (17), and eighth in ERA (3.40). He held batters to a .190 batting average when there were two outs and runners in scoring position. During Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS, Mussina authored one of the greatest clutch pitching performances of all time. With the Yankees trailing Boston 4–0, Mussina made the first relief appearance of his career. With runners on the corners and nobody out, Mussina struck out Jason Varitek before inducing Johnny Damon to hit into a double play. Mussina went on to pitch 2 more scoreless innings and kept the Yankees within striking distance in a game they later came back to win.

In 2004, plagued by a series of injuries, Mussina ended the year with a 12–9 record and a 4.59 ERA. He was fourth in the league in strikeouts (195), and eighth in walks/9 IP (2.19).

====2005–2008====
In 2005, Mussina finished with a 13–8 record and a 4.41 ERA. He was seventh in the AL in strikeouts/9 IP (7.11).

In 2006, he ended the season with a 15–7 record. He was second in the league in OBP against (.279), third in the American League in walks/9 IP (1.60; a career-best), batting average against (.241), and strikeout/walk ratio (4.91), fourth in ERA (3.51), sixth in win–loss percentage (.682). He fanned Cody Ross to reach the 2,500 strikeout mark on June 25. Mussina also became the first pitcher in American League history to win 10 or more games for 15 consecutive seasons.

On November 20, 2006, Mussina and the Yankees reached a preliminary agreement, pending a physical, on a two-year, $23 million contract. Earlier in the off-season the Yankees declined the one-year, $17 million option on Mussina&#x27;s previous contract. Under that back-loaded six-year, $88.5 million contract, Mussina earned $19 million in each of the last two seasons.

 In 2007, Mussina became just the ninth player to win 100 games with two different teams—he had won 147 with Baltimore. However, with the Yankees locked in a tight pennant race, Mussina struggled and temporarily lost his spot in the rotation to prospect Ian Kennedy. After just one relief appearance, (the first of his regular season career), Mussina returned as a starter, going 3–0 in his final four starts to end with 11–10 record and a career-high 5.15 ERA. The &#x27;07 season for Mussina and Mets&#x27; pitcher Tom Glavine was the subject of a 2008 book by John Feinstein, &quot;Living on the Black: Two Pitchers, Two Teams, One Season to Remember&quot;, showcasing a pivotal season for two New York City pitchers as Mussina nailed down milestone career win #250 with the Yankees and Glavine earned win #300 with the cross-town Mets.

In 2008, Mussina started his eighth season with the Yankees as a much-needed veteran of an inexperienced rotation. The year began with difficulty reminiscent of 2007, and many noted a sharp decline in his pitch velocity. Owner Hank Steinbrenner suggested that Mussina should &quot;learn how to pitch like Jamie Moyer&quot;, and no longer rely so much on his fastball. Although that remark was widely interpreted as a slight, Mussina joked in response that he could not pitch like Moyer because he did not throw left-handed, and afterwards he excelled, going 9–1 in his subsequent 11 starts. On June 14, he recorded his 10th win of the season, extending his American League record to 17 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins. On September 18, Mussina notched his 18th victory of the season and led the Yankees to a 9–2 victory over the first place White Sox in his final start at Yankee Stadium. On September 28, he won 20 games for the first time at the age of 39, with a 6–2 win over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, becoming the oldest first-time 20 game winner in MLB history. He finished 20–9 with a 3.37 ERA. His 67.6% first-strike-percentage was the highest among major league starters.
Mussina would later finish second to Cleveland Indians pitcher Cliff Lee in the voting for American League comeback player of the year honors. On November 6, he was awarded his seventh career Gold Glove Award, and the third in his career with the Yankees. He would later finish behind Lee again in the balloting for the 2008 AL Cy Young Award. Mussina&#x27;s sixth-place finish was his best since 2001.

Mussina officially announced his retirement on November 20, 2008. Mussina is the first pitcher to retire following a 20-victory season since Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax in 1966.

==Near-perfect games==
Mussina pitched several near-perfect games throughout his career:
* On July 17, 1992, he retired the first 12 Texas Rangers before surrendering a double to Kevin Reimer. Mussina retired the final 15 batters he faced for a one-hit 8–0 shutout.
* On May 30, 1997, he retired the first 25 Cleveland Indians before surrendering a single to Sandy Alomar Jr. with one out in the ninth. Mussina struck out the last two batters for a one-hit 3–0 shutout.
* On August 4, 1998, he retired the first 23 Detroit Tigers he faced before surrendering a double to Frank Catalanotto with two outs in the eighth. Mussina gave up another hit in the eventual two hit 4–0 shutout.
* On August 1, 2000, he tossed a one-hitter against the Minnesota Twins.
* On September 2, 2001, he retired the first 26 Boston Red Sox he faced; he then ran pinch-hitter Carl Everett (batting for Joe Oliver) to a 1-and-2 count before Everett blooped a single to left-center. Mussina then retired leadoff man Trot Nixon on a grounder, striking out 13 batters in a one-hit 1–0 shutout. The losing pitcher was David Cone—the pitcher of the last perfect game at the time, on July 18, 1999. Although Mussina did not achieve perfection, James Buckley Jr. considered it special enough to include an appendix chapter about it in his 2002 book &quot;Perfect: The Inside Story of Baseball&#x27;s Sixteen Perfect Games&quot;.

==Postseason performance==
Mussina collected an overall 7–8 record and 3.42 ERA, with 145 strikeouts in 23 career postseason games. His finest postseason occurred in 1997 for the Orioles, when in four games he went 2–0 with a 1.24 ERA in 29 innings pitched while allowing 11 hits, four earned runs, seven walks and 41 strikeouts. Notably, he twice outdueled Seattle Mariners ace Randy Johnson in head-to-head matchups during the ALDS. A feature on &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s website ranked his performance the sixth-most memorable moment at Camden Yards.

==Pitching style==
Early in his career, Mussina&#x27;s arsenal included a four-seam fastball that topped out at 95 mph, a two-seam fastball, a slider, a changeup, and a plus knuckle-curve. He was always a finesse pitcher, and coming up through the Orioles&#x27; organization, he was often compared to Jim Palmer. He received praise for the ability to make in-game adjustments to compensate for days when he was not at his best.

Mussina&#x27;s prolonged success was also the result of his ability to make adjustments. He added a splitter to his repertoire and replaced his knuckle-curve with a more conventional curveball. He became more skilled at changing speeds with his breaking pitches and using different arm angles to confuse batters as well as to compensate for the diminishing speed of his fastball.

During spring training in 2006, Yankees catcher Jorge Posada noticed the unique grip Mussina used for his changeup and promptly hit a home run off it during an intra-squad game. Posada alerted Mussina to the tip-off, and he adjusted the grip. This new changeup was difficult for batters to recognize and was considered a main reason for his success that season.

Mussina&#x27;s remarkable results in 2008 were attributed to changes in pitching style. While in the past he was known for painting the outside corner of the plate with a mid-90s four-seam fastball, he began to work on both sides of the plate with his diminished upper-80s fastball. Additionally, when throwing the fastball, he often used the two-seam grip, which gives the ball late breaking motion. Despite his lower fastball velocity, Mussina maintained a significant differential in pitch speed by also lowering the velocity of his changeup. In addition to those more obvious changes, Craig Brown of &quot;The Hardball Times&quot; also attributed Mussina&#x27;s renaissance to excellent control, noting that he was walking fewer batters than ever before and was becoming a ground-ball pitcher for the first time in his career.

Throughout his career, Mussina also complemented his pure pitching ability by doing the little things well. He issued very few walks, held baserunners well, and fielded his position superbly.

==Hall of Fame debate==

Mussina&#x27;s candidacy for the Hall of Fame was the subject of debate. &quot;Do I compare to some guys who are in? I think I do&quot;, Mussina told &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2006. The only other pitchers to match Mussina&#x27;s 17 seasons of 10 or more victories are Ted Lyons, Tom Glavine, Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Walter Johnson, Greg Maddux, Warren Spahn, Cy Young, Don Sutton, Tom Seaver, Tommy John and Steve Carlton; all are Hall of Famers, except Tommy John. Of the 23 eligible pitchers who have at least 265 wins and an ERA of 3.69 or less, 20 are in the Hall of Fame, his ERA is the third highest ahead of Bobby Wallace, who was a full-time pitcher for just two seasons, and Red Ruffing. Mussina&#x27;s consistency was often overshadowed by the dominant peaks of contemporaries like Pedro Martínez and Randy Johnson. Mussina&#x27;s ERA may have suffered from playing at a time when hitters dominated.

In 2014, Mussina received 20.3% of the vote on his first ballot (75% required for induction). In 2015, he received 24.6% on his second ballot. He rose to 43.0% in 2016 on his third ballot. In his fourth year of eligibility, support for his candidacy continued to steadily increase, as he received 51.8% of the vote. In 2018, he received 63.5% of the vote, inching closer to the 75% mark. 
Mussina was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame on August 25, 2012.

On January 22, 2019, Mussina was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, receiving 76.71% of the vote. He chose not to have a logo on his bust, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like I can pick one team over the other because they were both great to me. I did a lot in Baltimore and they gave me the chance and then in New York we went to the playoffs seven of eight years, and both teams were involved. To go in with no logo was the only decision I felt good about&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mussina married Jana McKissick in 1997. The couple has two sons, Brycen and Peyton. He also adopted his step-daughter Kyra, who is Jana&#x27;s from a previous marriage. He still resides in his hometown of Montoursville, where he is well known. He often helps out with the athletic programs at his high school and he operates a training camp for student athletes in the area. He serves on the Little League International Board of Directors, based in nearby South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Mussina is the head basketball coach for the boys&#x27; team at Montoursville Area High School. He accepted the position in June 2013. When he received the phone call notifying him that he had been elected to the Hall of Fame, he had just completed a practice with his team.

Mussina is of Slavic descent. Due to his last name, which was Americanized by his ancestors, he is often misidentified as an Italian American; before the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006, Gene Orza, the chief operating officer of the players union, even asked him to play for Italy on that assumption.

In December 2014, Mussina was announced as one of the six recipients of the 2015 Silver Anniversary Awards, presented annually by the NCAA to outstanding former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers. The award is based on both athletic and professional success.

Mussina is also a crossword puzzle enthusiast and was featured in the 2006 documentary film &quot;Wordplay&quot;.

He is also a collector of tractors and vintage cars.

<text>Paprzyca is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
Herb Paprzyca (Bychawa, Kuczawa, Ruchaba, Ruczaba, Paprzyca, Rakwicz) – coat of arms, with the clan&#x27;s battle cry of Iwiczna and Kuszaba.

&quot;From the Czech, this coat of arms was to be brought to Poland by Bolesław the Chaste, and this is how it was to be acquired: &quot;A lady was told that a maid had bore three sons, and she not only had her suspected of adultery on this occasion (understanding that with one husband so many children can not be) but also punished her severely. It came about thanks to the Divine cause, who defends the innocent, that the same lady gave birth to nine sons quickly. Whether then, whether ashamed or afraid of some lousy disagreement with her husband, she ordered a serving woman to have eight sons in a near river drowned, one of them only left to raise. At that time, her husband was not at home, but for the preparation of God, he came when the serving woman was carrying the children to their sad fate. He asked her: what are you carrying? She answered - I am carrying pups to drown. The husband looked inside out of curiosity if there was no one fit for game hunting; then he saw the children and learned everything. Secretly he ordered the miller to raise the sons. When they grew up, he guests and neighbours to a feast, and after feeding them he asked them as to what that a mother deserved who would kill her children, All judged her death worthy; Only then the father says: let my puppies stand here: they bring eight boys, all in the same coloring, vividness and complexity, almost all equal height. He explained to all those who have been invited what happened to them and, turning to his wife, he says - for this sin, you worthy of punishment much more significant, only God has kept you from sin through me; for this, thank him for his holy providence. Is it then for the sons in remembrance of this revolution or the miller who raised them as a reward, the shape of the coat of arms, the authors disagree.&quot;

==Blazon==
Description of the coat of arms 

In the silver field, a black millstone with a middle silver rynd. In the jewel, eight silver puppies heads in two rows; two at the top looking right, two left, one at the bottom looking right, and three turned left.
The description of the coat of arms Kuszaba appears already in Jewels of Jan Długosz: as Kuszaba. &quot;Cuius insignia lapis molaris griseus cum ferrea paprzicza in or campo.&quot; What in Translation means: Kuszaba. Which sign a millstone grey with iron debris in a white field.
According to Niesiecki (...), there should be a millstone upright, grey in color, with a cast iron in the middle, as in the field, in the field with white, on the helmet with eight puppies.
Szymański claims that &quot;(...) in a silver field, a millstone (black) with silver papy&quot;.
By the act of the Harold Union, the coat of arms was transferred to Lithuania (the Lithuanian boyar Manstold adopted the boyar, he adopted Marmicz from Iwiczny Iwicki, the Łęczyca bailiff).

<text>Basildon railway station is on the London, Tilbury and Southend line, serving the town of Basildon, Essex. It is down the main line from London Fenchurch Street and is situated between to the west and to the east. Its three-letter station code is BSO. The station and all its trains are currently operated by c2c.

== History ==
The &quot;Pitsea direct&quot; line of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway was opened between East Horndon and Pitsea on 1 June 1888 and allowed trains between London and Southend to avoid the longer route via Tilbury, significantly reducing journey times. Laindon station opened with the new line in 1888 and Pitsea, originally opened in 1855, became a junction station. 

Basildon was designated a new town on 4 January 1949. Laindon and Pitsea stations fell within the new town boundary, albeit on the periphery. As was the case at other new towns, it took many years to deliver a railway station. Basildon station was opened by British Rail on 25 November 1974. 

In September 2022, the down (towards Southend) platform was partially closed, preventing 12-carriage trains from calling at the station in that direction.

== Design ==
The station has two platforms, both located on the upper level.

The ticket hall houses a retail unit as well as self-service ticket machines. The ticket office has three serving positions.

== Services ==
Basildon is served by c2c trains westbound to Fenchurch Street in the City of London and eastbound to Shoeburyness in eastern Essex.

As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
* 4 tph (trains per hour) westbound to London Fenchurch Street (2 tph all stations and 2 tph semi-fast)
* 4 tph eastbound to (2 tph all stations and 2 tph semi-fast)

<text>Lis (Polish for &quot;Fox&quot;) is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by many noble families of Clan Lis.

==The legend of the coat of arms==

In 1058 Duke Casimir I the Restorer while chasing the pagan Lithuanians and Yotvingians who devastated Polish lands, came to Sochaczew. He sent a knight of the Lis Clan (&quot;Fox Clan&quot;) to scout the region for enemies. When the knight came across a river he met a strong enemy unit. Unable to attack them alone, he decided immediately to shoot a lighted arrow into the air to call for reinforcements. Help arrived soon and defeated the enemies. A grateful Casimir granted the brave knight a new coat of arms with an arrow in the escutcheon and his former sign - the fox - was placed in the crest.

<doc id="1065067" wikidata="Q7356817" url="?curid=1065067" title="Rodman gun">
<text>The Rodman gun is any of a series of American Civil War–era columbiads designed by Union artillery officer Thomas Jackson Rodman (1815–1871). The guns were designed to fire both shot and shell. These heavy guns were intended to be mounted in seacoast fortifications. 8-inch, 10-inch, 13-inch, 15-inch, and 20-inch bore () Rodman guns were produced. Other than size, the guns were all nearly identical in design, with a curving bottle shape, a large flat cascabels, and ratchets or sockets for the elevating mechanism. Rodman guns were true guns that did not have a howitzer-like powder chamber, as did many earlier columbiads. Rodman guns differed from all previous artillery because they were hollow cast, a new technology that Rodman developed that resulted in cast-iron guns that were much stronger than their predecessors.

== Casting ==
Traditionally, a gun was cast as a solid body, with the bore then drilled out of the solid metal. In this method, a newly cast gun cooled from the outside in. Castings shrink as they cool. As each succeeding layer cooled it contracted, pulling away from the still molten metal in the center, creating voids and tension cracks. Drilling out the bore removed the voids, but the tensions in the metal were still toward the outside. Rodman devised a method of hollow casting where the gun cooled from the inside out, so that as cooling occurred, it created compression rather than tension. This resulted in a much stronger gun.

In Rodman&#x27;s method, a cooling core was placed in the mold before casting. This core consisted of a watertight cast-iron tube, closed at the lower end. A second, smaller tube, open at the bottom was inserted into the first. As the molten iron was poured into the mold, water was pumped through the smaller tube to the bottom of the larger tube. The water rose through the space between the two tubes and flowed out at the top. The water continued flowing as the metal cooled. To further ensure that the gun cooled from the inside out, a fire was built around the iron flask containing the gun mold, keeping the gun mold nearly red-hot. For an 8-inch Rodman columbiad, the core was removed 25 hours after casting and the flow of water continued through the space left by the core for another 40 hours. Over of water was used in the process. For larger guns, the cooling periods were longer and more water was used.

After cooling the gun, the machining process began. The bore was bored out to proper size, the exterior was turned smooth, the trunnions were turned on a trunnion lathe, and a vent was drilled.

Columbiads were not the only guns cast using Rodman&#x27;s method. Dahlgren XV-inch shell guns for the US Navy were also hollow cast. A 20-inch hollow cast gun, which may not have been identical to the two guns supplied to the US Army, was sold to Peru.

Rodman guns were cast at the Fort Pitt Foundry, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Scott Foundry, Reading, Pennsylvania; Cyrus Alger &amp; Co., Boston, Massachusetts; and the West Point Foundry, Cold Spring, New York.

== Carriages ==

Rodman guns were mounted on three types of carriages—a front-pintle barbette carriage, a center-pintle barbette carriage, and a casemate carriage. All of these carriages were made of wrought iron. All three types of carriage were similar in design, having an upper carriage that was placed on a two-rail chassis. The gun and upper carriage recoiled along the chassis. The chassis would pivot to train the gun left or right.

The barbette carriages were designed to fire over a parapet and could be used in either permanent or temporary fortifications. The front pintle carriage pivoted at the front of the chassis. This made the gun mount more compact and allowed the gun and detachment to be better protected by embrasures and traverses. The center pintle carriage gave the gun a 360° traverse and was stronger for guns firing at high angles because the pintle, the strongest part of the carriage, would have been under the breech when the gun was fired at high angles.

The casemate carriage was designed to fire from casemates, which were chambers in permanent fortifications. The carriage was essentially a front-pintle design, with the pintle fixed in the masonry in front of the chassis and below the guns embrasure. A &quot;tongue&quot; connected the chassis to the pintle. The casemate carriage has a lower profile than the barbette carriages.

The 8-inch and 10-inch Rodman guns could be mounted on all three types of carriages. The 15-inch Rodman guns were mounted on both types of barbette carriage. The two 20-inch guns were mounted on front-pintle barbette carriages.

Sling carts were used to transport these guns to the carriages.

== Production ==

Rodman guns were all nearly identical in design, with a curving soda bottle shape, the only differences being the size of the gun. They were all smoothbore guns designed to fire spherical shot and shell, primarily against ships. The guns were elevated and depressed by means of a lever called the elevating bar. The point of this lever fits into ratchets on the earliest guns cast, or sockets on the later guns. The fulcrum, called the ratchet post, fit on the rear transom of the upper carriage. The ratchet post was cast iron and had several notches for adjusting the position of the elevating bar.

Only one 13-inch Rodman gun appears to have been made, but it was placed in service. Two 20-inch Rodman guns were emplaced at Fort Hamilton, New York. A third, shorter 20-inch gun was cast for USS &quot;Puritan&quot; using the Rodman technology. One 20-inch Rodman gun remains in a park just north of Fort Hamilton, and another is at Fort Hancock, New Jersey.

The other, smaller Rodman guns were placed in seacoast fortifications around the United States. It took eight men to load and fire a 10-inch Rodman gun, and 12 men for a 15-inch Rodman gun.

Over 140 Rodman guns survive today. They may be seen at coastal fortifications around the country.

== Use ==

Rodman guns saw little action during the Civil War. Two 10-inch columbiads were used in 1864 and 1865 in Union operations against Fort Sumter. It seems likely, due to the time period in which they were used, that these were Rodman guns rather than earlier model columbiads. Other reports of the use of 8-inch and 10-inch columbiads may refer to Rodman guns. The 15-inch Rodman guns were never fired in anger; however, they were widely deployed in coast defense until replaced by Endicott Period fortifications in 1895–1905. Some Rodmans of various sizes, along with Parrott rifles, were deployed shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898 as a stopgap; it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast.

The 20-inch Rodmans were only fired eight times in practice to determine the effect of the projectiles. It was nearly impossible to find a target that would leave enough evidence to measure the effect of hits. The first four shots were fired with charges of 50, 75, 100, and of gunpowder, reaching a bore pressure of . Four more shots were fired in March 1867 with charges of 125, 150, 175, and throwing the projectile with the barrel elevated to 25 degrees.

=== Rifled versions ===
During the War, and immediately after, attempts were made to cast rifled Rodman guns. Unsuccessful attempts were made to cast a 12-inch rifle in 1861, an 8-inch rifle in 1862, and another 12-inch rifle in 1868. However, Robert Parker Parrott at the Cold Spring Foundry, across the Hudson River from the United States Army Military Academy at West Point, used the Rodman water core method of casting to produce large-bore rifled guns in 200- and 300-pound models. Parrott rifles that had been cast using the Rodman method were inscribed with the initials WC in order to differentiate those guns from ones that had been cast using ordinary methods. Primarily these guns were used on naval vessels, especially large monitors.
In the 1870s and 1880s, efforts focused on converting existing Rodman guns into rifles. 10-inch Rodman smoothbore guns were converted into 8-inch rifles. The first method used was inserting a wrought iron rifle sleeve through the muzzle; a similar steel sleeve was also used later. The last method involved drilling and tapping the breech of the 10-inch Rodman and inserting a rifled steel sleeve and screwing it in tight with a threaded breech plug. These breech-inserted guns are easily recognized by the square cascabel which was designed to provide purchase for screwing the breech plug and liner securely into the gun.

These conversions were not viewed favorably and were primarily seen as cheap stopgaps until modern breech-loading rifles could be developed and emplaced. However, the 8-inch converted rifle was widely deployed in fortifications constructed in the 1870s, and remained in service until 1905.

=== Confederate copies ===

In 1859 Joseph R. Anderson of the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia, and Junius L. Archer of the Bellona Foundry in Midlothian, Virginia (the only two gun foundries then operating in what would become the Confederacy), failed to adopt the Rodman technique of hollow casting, and as result the US Army cancelled contracts with both firms for casting columbiads. Therefore, at the outbreak of the war, southern foundries were not capable of casting guns using the Rodman method.

The Confederates used solid cast 8-inch and 10-inch columbiads that resemble Rodman guns. A closer examination of these Confederate columbiads reveals that they have a straighter cylindrical contour between the trunnions and the breech as opposed to the sweeping continuous curve of the Rodman gun. The Confederate columbiads have longer trunnions that were intended for use with heavy wooden carriages. The Union gun were designed to be mounted in iron carriages with thinner cheeks, permitting shorter trunnions. The exteriors of the Confederate columbiads are rough, not having been finished on a lathe as were their Union counterparts.

On November 14, 1864, and February 20, 1865, at the Tredegar Iron Works, Anderson cast two 12-inch columbiads using the Rodman method. The guns were made too late and were never finished or mounted.

== Similar weapons ==

The 3-inch ordnance rifle and the 4.5-inch siege rifle were frequently misidentified as Rodmans. Neither gun was hollow cast. The 3-inch ordnance rifle was made of hammer-welded wrought iron, and the 4.5-inch siege rifle was conventionally cast.

This error was not limited to those ignorant of artillery; in November 1864 Brig. Gen. John Milton Brannan, chief of artillery in the Union Department of the Cumberland, described the armament of the Chattanooga forts as including several 3-inch and 4.5-inch Rodman guns. First Lieutenant Henry S. Hurter of the 1st Minnesota Light Artillery Battery wrote in his report to Oscar Malmros, Adjutant General for the State of Minnesota, &quot;On the 5th of March captain Clayton exchanged the old guns, two 12-pound howitzers, and two 6-pound rifled guns, caliber 3.67, for four new rifled 3-inch Rodman&#x27;s guns.&quot; The letter was written on November 11, 1864, in Georgia.

<doc id="1065068" wikidata="Q1753179" url="?curid=1065068" title="Anthems of Rebellion">
<text>Anthems of Rebellion is the fifth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy. This was the first Arch Enemy album to feature clean vocals. The clean vocals were sung by Christopher Amott on &quot;End of the Line&quot; and &quot;Dehumanization&quot;.

A music video was produced for the album&#x27;s single, &quot;We Will Rise&quot;, which saw moderate airing on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and &quot;Uranium&quot;. It featured a legion of people racing across a beach under a darkened sky. According to the band, one of the participants in the video hurt an ankle considerably in leaping off a large hill but did not sue.

A video was also produced for &quot;Dead Eyes See No Future&quot;, which consisted of a live performance. The song also appeared on the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; Original Soundtrack.

The songs &quot;Dehumanization&quot;, &quot;Leader of the Rats&quot;, &quot;End of the Line&quot;, and &quot;Instinct&quot; can be heard on the MTV reality series &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;; End of the Line is heard in the season 2 episode Mardi Gras, Pt. 1.

==Release==
At its time of release, &quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; gave Century Media its then highest first-week Soundscan sales in the United States, and later became one of the top ten best-selling albums under the record label.

===Bonus disc===
In numerous regions, a bonus DVD was supplied with the initial release in three forms. Track listings would be identical, save the Europe jewel case edition, which omitted &quot;Exist to Exit&quot; (5.1). The U.S. jewel case release and Europe digipak included all tracks available on the releases.

==Reception==
&quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; was received mostly well. Sean Palmerston and Laura Taylor of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; praised the album stating that it is the &quot;finest album so far without a doubt&quot; and that &quot;with Gossow&#x27;s death-rattle vocals, and tight performances all around, &quot;Anthems of Rebellio&quot;n is a pretty delectable razor to the eardrums&quot;, respectively. Gregory Bradley of Metal Review called the album of &quot;a vicious beast of millennium death/thrash&quot;. He praised the Angela Gossow vocals stating that they &quot;are absolutely top notch, some of the best and most signature vocals out there.&quot; Bradley also comments that the backing vocals were &quot;a very welcome surprise&quot;. Justin Donnelly of &quot;Blistering&quot; that praised Gossow writing that her &quot;vocal delivery is a solid improvement, and not only complements the aggressive music, but seems to bring more power and style than ever before&quot;, commented that the inclusion of Christopher Amott&#x27;s backing vocal &quot;works surprisingly well&quot;. He said that everything on &quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; makes it &quot;one of Arch Enemy&#x27;s most finest, most diverse yet satisfying releases to date&quot;. About the clean vocals, Jackie Smit of &quot;Chronicles of Chaos&quot; commented that they were &quot;well-implemented&quot;. Smit felt that the keyboard lines &quot;add a welcome dash of variety to the proceedings&quot;. Nevertheless, he disliked of the lyrics, but stated that &quot;Arch Enemy have produced perhaps their best record to date&quot;, though.

EvilG of Metal Rules praised the producer and the band. He said that &quot;the sound and clarity of the album is great, thanks to producer Andy Sneap&quot; and that the band &quot;easily outplays many of their peers from the melodic death metal and blackened thrash metal heap, yet they still manage to push the boundaries of their musical style and create a fury that is second to none.&quot; Critic Anders Sandvall, also of Metal Rules, stated that &quot;the band has done a masterpiece in their genre&quot;. Carl Begai of &quot;Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles&quot; called Sneap&#x27;s production &quot;ridiculously perfect&quot; and stated that &quot;Metallica could learn a lot from listening to this album&quot;. He comments that &quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; &quot;is an excellent follow-up to their now classic breakthrough album&quot;, but the band will probably never surpass the song &quot;Enemy Within&quot; from &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;. Ralph of &quot;Lords of Metal&quot; praised the album and the production of Sneap. He completes stating that &quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; is a &quot;very complete metal record&quot;. David Atkinson of &quot;RevelationZ Magazine&quot; praised the album stating that &quot;this is everything Metallica was, should have been and could have been!&quot;. Atkinson compared it with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Metallica and &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; by Megadeth and called it of classic.

Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic called Gossow&#x27;s performances of &quot;superb&quot;. He also mentioned that the band balances out the heavy and melodic parts very well and praised the album when he wrote that &quot;infectious melodic guitars, top notch vocal efforts, superb song writing, this album has everything one would want from a band of this stature. Definitely an impressive album.&quot; However, Stagno wrote that the songs &quot;Tear Down the Walls&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot; are unnecessary. Tony Daley of Blabbermouth.net said that Mike Amott is a fantastic guitarist, but felt that the album &quot;still isn&#x27;t quite what he and his band are realistically capable of.&quot; Vincent Eldefors of &quot;Tartarean Desire&quot; praised Gossow, however, he said that the previous release was more impressive. Todd Kristel of Allmusic, who wrote a mixed review of the album, stated that &quot;In general, the lyrics aren&#x27;t particularly impressive and the band has only mixed success at musically evoking the pervasive sense of menace they seem to be going after.&quot; Meanwhile, he concluded that it &quot;is a reasonably solid album that should appeal to the band&#x27;s fans.&quot;

After the Union of Horodło of 1413 CE several boyar families adopted this coat of arms.

<text>A saveloy is a type of highly seasoned sausage, usually bright red, normally boiled and available in fish and chip shops around Britain. It is sometimes also available fried in batter.

== Etymology ==
The word is believed to be derived from Middle French or , originating from Old Italian (&#x27;pigs brains&#x27;), ultimately from the Latin (&#x27;brain&#x27;). Its first known use in the English language in this meaning was 1784. is still the name of a sausage in Italy; it is longer and thinner than standard Italian sausages.

== Ingredients ==
Although the saveloy was traditionally made from pig brains, the ingredients of a shop-bought sausage are typically pork (58%), water, rusk, pork fat, potato starch, salt, emulsifiers (tetrasodium diphosphate, disodium diphosphate), white pepper, spices, dried sage, preservatives (sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate), and beef collagen casing.

The saveloy is mostly eaten with chips.

== England and Wales==

Popular in the northeast of England, saveloys are sometimes eaten in a &quot;saveloy dip&quot; sandwich: the bun is dipped in the water in which the saveloy has been boiled, or in gravy, with a layer of stuffing and pease pudding, additionally seasoned with English mustard. Elsewhere in England (particularly London) and Wales, saveloy is most commonly served in fish and chip shops.

== Australia and New Zealand ==
The saveloy is eaten in Australia and New Zealand, often dipped in batter and deep fried, when it is known as a &quot;battered sav&quot;.

At the turn of the 20th century, the saveloy was described in an Australian court case as a &quot;highly seasoned dry sausage originally made of brains, but now young pork, salted&quot; but by the mid-century, it was commonly defined by its size as a sausage, as opposed to a frankfurter at . This distinction may be due to frankfurters’ popularisation in that country (as the main ingredient in hot dogs). Saveloys also tend to have more seasoning and are thicker.

In Australia, saveloys are usually a beef-pork blend. As in England, they are sold at fish-and-chip shops, as well as bought from supermarkets, to be simmered at home.

Saveloys are often the basis of the New Zealand battered-sausage-on-a-stick &quot;hot dog&quot;, very similar to the US corn meal-battered variant of the corn dog as sold at fairgrounds and shows. The Australian showground version is often called a &quot;dagwood dog&quot;, when prepared on site (and should not be confused with the &quot;pluto pup&quot;, equivalent to the US Pronto Pup, a mass-produced, pre-prepared product that is essentially the same, but which invariably uses frankfurters, rather than saveloys and can often be found at takeaway shops).

A cocktail sausage is a smaller version of the saveloy, about a quarter of the size; in Australia sometimes called a &quot;baby sav&quot;, a &quot;footy frank&quot; or a &quot;little boy&quot;, and in New Zealand and Queensland called a &quot;cheerio&quot;. These are a popular children&#x27;s party food in New Zealand and Australia, often served hot, with tomato sauce.

== United States ==
A type of hot dog which is almost indistinguishable from the saveloy is popular in the state of Maine, where it is commonly known as a &quot;red hot&quot; or &quot;red snapper&quot;.

<doc id="1065085" wikidata="Q34601" url="?curid=1065085" title="Chilon of Sparta">
<text>Chilon of Sparta () (fl. 6th century BC) was a Spartan politician credited with the militarization of Spartan society, and one of the Seven Sages of Greece.

==Life==
Chilon was the son of Damagetus, and lived towards the beginning of the 6th century BC. Herodotus speaks of him as contemporary with Hippocrates, the father of Peisistratus. Diogenes Laërtius states that he was an old man in the 52nd Olympiad (572 BC), and that he was elected an ephor (overseer) in Sparta in the 56th Olympiad (556/5 BC). Alcidamas states that he was a member of the Spartan assembly. Diogenes Laërtius even goes so far as to claim that Chilon was also the first person who introduced the custom of joining the ephors to the kings as their counselors.

Chilon is said to have helped to overthrow the tyranny at Sicyon, which became a Spartan ally. He is also credited with the change in Spartan policy leading to the development of the Peloponnesian League in the sixth century BC. Another legend claims that he died of joy when his son gained the prize for boxing at the Olympic games, and that his funeral was attended by all the Greeks assembled at the festival.

One of his descendants married king Anaxandridas II of Sparta and had a son with him, king Cleomenes I.
==Sayings and teachings==
Chilon of Sparta also said the famous Ancient Greek proverb: &quot;Το λακωνίζειν εστί φιλοσοφείν&quot;, in English &quot;less is more&quot;, or &quot;brevity is the soul of wit&quot;, or &quot;brevity is a way of philosophy&quot;, which means that the best way of being a philosopher is through brevity and describes the Spartans&#x27; way of thinking and attitude.
Diogenes Laërtius describes him as a writer of elegiac poems, and attributes many sayings to him: 
* &quot;Do not speak evil of the dead.&quot;
* &quot;Honor old age.&quot;
* &quot;Prefer punishment to disgraceful gain; for the one is painful but once, but the other for one&#x27;s whole life.&quot;
* &quot;Do not laugh at a person in misfortune.&quot;
* &quot;If one is strong be also merciful, so that one&#x27;s neighbors may respect one rather than fear one.&quot;
* &quot;Learn how to regulate one&#x27;s own house well.&quot;
* &quot;Do not let one&#x27;s tongue outrun one&#x27;s sense.&quot;
* &quot;Restrain anger.&quot;
* &quot;Do not dislike divination.&quot;
* &quot;Do not desire what is impossible.&quot;
* &quot;Do not make too much haste on one&#x27;s road.&quot;
* &quot;Obey the laws.&quot;
According to an inscription at the Bath of the Seven Sages in Ostia &quot;cunning Chilon taught to fart silently.&quot; Chilon was the sage traditionally credited with the famous Delphic maxim: &quot;Know thyself&quot;—though this attribution is not universal, and others of the Seven Sages of Greece, or even the god Apollo himself, were also variously supposed to be its originators.

<text>Giuseppe Acerbi (May 3, 1773August 25, 1846) was an Italian naturalist, explorer and composer.

==Biography==
Giuseppe Acerbi was born on May 3, 1773, in Castel Goffredo, in Lombardy. He was an Italian naturalist, explorer and composer. In 1798, Acerbi traveled to Lapland, publishing his experiences in &quot;Travels through Sweden, Finland and Lapland to the North Cape in the years 1798 and 1799&quot; (1802). Some of his works can be found in the New York Society Library in New York, New York. He also written other works along with compositions that became popular.

During his travels, he collected some Finnish folk melodies and religious songs, one of which he used in a Clarinet Concerto. This was the first Finnish melody to be used in serious music.

In 1836, Acerbi retired from his travels and career. He returned to his hometown Castel Goffredo. He began to organize and administer his notes and collections from his travels. He never completed the task; Giuseppe Acerbi died in his hometown of Castel Goffredo, Italy on August 25, 1846. He was seventy-three years old.

== Education ==
Giuseppe Acerbi was educated by both his parents at a young age. As he got older, he eventually was taught by a tutor that demanded Acerbi to learn Italian, French, German and English as an addition of knowing his native Lombard language. He also learned Latin to add to his list of languages. He was taught about classic music, art, and become heavily involved with the sciences. At the age of twenty one, he graduated and received a degree of law from University at Pavia.

== Travels ==

Since the start of his travels, the Finnish coast was not what Acerbi expected. From the beginning, Acerbi hated it. He was shocked by the culture of the people and did not enjoy it.
After fighting with other explorers that were part of his trip, Acerbi decided travel through Finnish Lapland by himself on his return of going home. On his way, he recorded hundreds of pages of observations on the Sami people. He wrote notes on the Sami music, language, clothing and the customs. Eventually, he would grow to appreciate the Sami people and culture.

During his stay in Finland he picked up several books of poems, &quot;Jos mun tuttuni tulisi ( &quot;If you were my dear&quot;)&quot;, the lullaby &quot;Nuku, nuku nurmilintu ( &quot;Sleep, sleep little bird&quot;)&quot;, the poem of Antti Keksi about the flood of the river Tornionjoki in 1677, eventually becoming a religious song. He recorded the melody of the song &quot;Do Not Be afraid of the People of Finland&quot; and of Kalevala, the Finnish epic poem, composed of 50 songs, or runi, describing the execution of the poems, the local shaman singers, 

The figure of Acerbi is much more famous in Finland than in Italy: the Finnish radio station&#x27;s title is derived from its melody. Acerbi returned to Italy for after the publication of his book.

The , an Italian literary award, is named for Acerbi.
