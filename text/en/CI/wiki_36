<text>Sainte-Geneviève Library (, ) is a university library of the universities of Paris, administered by the Sorbonne-Nouvelle University (a public liberal arts and humanities university) located at 10, place du Panthéon, across the square from the Panthéon, in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.

It is based on the collection of the Abbey of St Genevieve, which was founded in the 6th century by Clovis I, the King of the Franks. The collection of the library was saved from destruction during the French Revolution. A new reading room for the library, with an innovative iron frame supporting the roof, was built between 1838 and 1851 by architect Henri Labrouste. The library contains around 2 million documents, and currently is the principal inter-university library for the different universities of Paris, and is also open to the public. It is administratively affiliated with Sorbonne Nouvelle University.

==History==
===The Monastic library===
The Abbey of St Genevieve is said to have been founded by King Clovis I and his queen, Clotilde. It was located near the present church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont and the present Panthéon, which was built atop the original abbey church. The abbey was said to have been founded at the beginning of the 6th century at the suggestion of Saint Genevieve, who selected the site, across from the original Roman forum. She died in 502 and Clovis died in 511, and the basilica was completed in 520. It held the tombs of Saint Genevieve, Clovis, and his descendants.

By the 9th century, the basilica had been transformed into an Abbey church, and a large monastery had grown up around it, including a scriptorium for the creation and copying of texts. The first record of the existence of the Sainte-Genevieve library dates from 831, and mentions the donation of three texts to the Abbey. The texts created or copied included works of history and literature, as well as theology, However, in the course of the 9th century, the Vikings raided Paris three times. While the settlement on the Ile-de-la-Cité was protected by the river, the abbey of Saint-Genevieve was sacked, and the books lost or carried away.

The library was gradually reassembled. During the reign of Louis VI of France (1108–1137) the Abbey had a particularly important role in European scholarship. The doctrines originally taught by Saint Augustine, and promoted by Suger (1081–1151), the influential religious advisor to the King, required the reading aloud of scriptures, and specified that each monastery have a workshop to produce books and place to keep them. From 1108 to 1113, the scholar Peter Abelard taught at the Abbey school, challenging many aspects of traditional theology and philosophy. 
Around about 1108, the theology school of the Abbey of Saint Genevieve, was joined with the School of Notre Dame Cathedral and the school of the Royal Palace to form the future University of Paris.By the early 13th century the university library was already famous throughout Europe. The early holdings of the library from this time are listed in a 13th-century inventory (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS lat. 16203, fol. 71v). The 226 titles and authors included in the 13th century inventory include bibles, commentaries and ecclesiastical history; but also books on philosophy, law, science and literature. It was open not only to students, but also to French and foreign scholars. The manuscripts were of considerable value: each manuscript was marked with a warning notice that any person who stole or damaged a manuscript would be punished by anathema, or excommunication from the church.

===15th Century to the 18th century===
Shortly after Gutenberg produced his first printed books in the mid-15th century, the library began collecting printed books. The University of Paris invited several of his collaborators to Paris to begin a new publishing house. The library possesses a text of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; published in 1499, with engravings after the drawings of Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini. At the same time, the Abbey continued to produce manuscripts illuminated by hand. The Wars of Religion seriously disrupted the activities of the library. In the 16th and 17th century the library ceased to acquire new books and stopped producing catalogs of its holdings. Many manuscripts were dispersed and sold.

The library was brought back to life beginning in 1619, during the reign of Louis XIII, by Cardinal Francois de Rochefoucauld. He saw the library as an important weapon of the Counter-Reformation against Protestantism. He donated six hundred volumes from his personal collection. The new library director, Jean Fronteau, asked writers including Pierre Corneille, and famous librarians including Gabriel Naudé, to help update and expand the collection. However, he had to leave, under suspicion of being a heretical Jansenist. He was succeeded by Claude Du Mollinet, librarian from 1673 until 1687. Du Mollinet founded a famous small museum, the &quot;Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, with Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, medals, rare minerals and stuffed animals, within the library. By 1687 the library possessed twenty thousand books, and four hundred manuscripts.

During the late 18th century, the library acquired copies of the major works of the Age of the Enlightenment, including the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. In the same spirit, the library and the Cabinet of Curiosities were opened to the public. The Library was still attached to the Abbey and the University of Paris, but it ceased to be a library of theology only; by the mid-eighteenth century a majority of the works were in other fields of knowledge. While the Abbey still paid part of the cost, the major part was paid by the City of Paris.

===The Revolution and its aftermath===
Following the French Revolution, the status of the Library changed dramatically. In 1790, the Abbey was secularized, and all of its property, including the library, was confiscated, and the community of monks who ran the library was broken up. Due to the diplomatic skills of the director, Alexandre Pingré, his reputation as an astronomer and geographer, and his contacts within the new government, the collection was not dispersed, and actually grew, as the library took in the collections confiscated from other Abbeys. The library was granted equal status with the National Library, the future Mazarine Library and Arsenal Library, and could draw books from the same sources. Pingré remained as director until his death in 1796.

In 1796, the name of the library was changed; it became the National Library of the Panthéon. named for the neighboring Abbey church, then under construction, which had also been confiscated and renamed. While the collection of books remained intact, the famous cabinet of Curiosities was broken up and some its collection was dispersed to the National Library and Museum of Natural History. However, the Library did manage to retain a large number of objects, including the celebrated astronomical clock, the oldest example of its kind, acquired by the library in about 1695, and a variety of terrestrial and celestial globes, as well as objects illustrating cultures around the world, which are on display in the library today. The library also displays a notable collection of eighty-six busts of French scientists, some made by the leading French sculptors of the 17th and 18th centuries, including busts by Antoine Coysevox, Jean-Antoine Houdon, and François Girardon.

===The early 19th century===
The library continued to flourish in the early 19th century, under the French Directory and then the Empire of Napoleon. After the death of Pingré the library was directed by Pierre Claude Francois Daunou. He traveled to Rome, following Napoleon&#x27;s army, and arranged for the transfer to Paris of books confiscated from the papal collections. The library also received collections of books confiscated from nobles who had fled abroad during the Revolution. At the time of the fall of Napoleon, the library had a collection of one hundred ten thousand books and manuscripts.

The fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the monarchy brought new problems for the library. The collection of the library had more than doubled in size, and needed more space. However, the library shared the 18th-century building of the old Abbey Sainte-Genevieve with a prestigious school, originally known as the central school of the Panthéon, then as the Lycée Napoleon, and then and today as the Lycée Henri IV. The two institutions battled for space between 1812 and 1842. Though the library was supported by famous writers, including Victor Hugo and Jules Michelet, the son of King Louis-Philippe was a student at the lycée, and the lycée won. The library was finally expelled from its building. Some features of the old building, including the painted dome, can still be seen within the Lycée.

===The Labrouste building===
After the expulsion of the library from its old site, the government decided to build a new building for the collection. It was the first library in Paris to be constructed specifically as a library. The site chosen was close to the old library. It had originally been occupied by the medieval Collége de Montaigu, where Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola, John Calvin and François Rabelais had been students. After the Revolution that building had been transformed into a hospital and then a military prison, and was largely in ruins. It was to be demolished to make way for the new library.

The architect chosen for the project was Henri Labrouste. Born in 1801, he had studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he won the Prix de Rome in 1824, and spent six years studying Italian classical and Renaissance architecture. He had received few architectural commissions, but in 1838 he received the title of Inspector of Historic Monuments, and in this capacity he began to plan the new building. Since the Lycée wanted the space as soon as possible, all the books had been moved in 1842 to a temporary library in the only surviving building of Montaigu College. His project was confirmed by the Chamber of Deputies in 1843, and a budget voted. The building was completed in December 1850. and opened to the public on 4 February 1851.

The new library showed the influence of the prevailing academic beaux-arts style and the influence of Florence and Rome, but in other ways it was strikingly original. The base and facade resembled Roman buildings, with simple arched windows and discreet bands of sculpture. The façade, exactly the length of the reading room, and the large windows, expressed the function of the building. The primary decorative element of the façade is a list of names of famous scholars.

Unlike earlier buildings, the major decorative element of the building was not on the façade, but in the architecture of the reading room. The slender iron columns and the lace-like cast iron arches under the roof were not concealed; combined with the large windows they gave an immediate impression of space and lightness. It was a major step in the creation of modern architecture.

The large (278 by 69 feet) two-storied structure filling a wide, shallow site is deceptively simple in plan: the lower floor is occupied by stacks to the left, rare-book storage and office space to the right, with a central vestibule and stairway leading to the reading room which fills the entire upper story. The vestibule was designed to symbolize the beginning of a journey in search of knowledge, the visitors arrives through a space decorated with murals of gardens and forest and passes busts of famous French scholars and scientists. The monumental staircase from the ground floor to the reading room is placed so it doesn&#x27;t take any space from the reading room. Labrouste also designed building so that a majority of the books (sixty thousand) were in the reading room, easily accessible, with a minority (forty thousand) in the reserves. The iron structure of this reading room—a spine of sixteen slender, cast-iron Ionic columns dividing the space into twin aisles and supporting openwork iron arches that carry barrel vaults of plaster reinforced by iron mesh—is revered by Modernists for its introduction of high technology into a monumental building.

Labrouste went on to design the Salle Labrouste, the main reading room in the old Bibliothèque Nationale de France in the Rue de Richelieu, Paris, built between 1862 and 1868. Later in the century, the American architect Charles Follen McKim used the Sainte-Geneviève Library building as the model his design of the main building of the Boston Public Library. It also influenced the design of university libraries in the United States, including Low Memorial Library at Columbia University in New York, the Doe Library of the University of California at Berkeley by John Galen Howard, also a former student of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and the Margaret Carnegie Library at Mills College in California, designed by Julia Morgan, also a former student of the Ecole des Beaux Arts.

===Later years – expansion and modification===
Between 1851 and 1930, the library&#x27;s collection grew from one hundred thousand volumes to over a million, requiring a series of reconstructions and modifications. In 1892, a hoist was installed to lift books from the reserves to the reading room; it is now on display. A more serious change was made between 1928 and 1934. The number of seats in the reading room was doubled to seven hundred fifty. To accomplish this, the seating plan of the reading room was drastically changed; the original plan had long tables which stretched the entire length of the room, divided by a central spine of bookshelves, making the room seem even longer. In the new plan, the central bookshelves were removed and tables crossed the room, increasing the seating but reducing the linear effect. As the collection continued to grow, a new annex in the modernist style was added in 1954. The later computerization of the catalog created space for an additional one hundred seats. The building was classified as a national historic monument in 1992. Today the library is classified as a national library, a university library and a public library.

==Notable users==
Notable users of the library included the paleontologist Georges Cuvier, the botanist Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, the historian Jules Michelet, and Victor Hugo. It also appears as a setting in works of fiction, including in &quot;Les Illusions Perdues&quot; of Honoré de Balzac, in the novels of Simone de Beauvoir, in &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce and the writings of Guillaume Apollinaire. The Portuguese novelist Aquilino Ribeiro was a user of the library. The artist Marcel Duchamp was employed in the book reserve in 1913, at the time he was enjoying his first public exhibition in New York, and in his notes for his most famous sculpture Large Glass, he recommends that those seeking to understand him &quot;read the &quot;entire&quot; section on perspective in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève.&quot;

<text>Terence John Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 2nd Marquess of Dufferin and Ava DL JP (16 March 1866 – 7 February 1918), styled Lord Terence Blackwood between 1888 and 1900 and Earl of Ava between 1900 and 1902, was a British diplomat.

==Early life==
Lord Dufferin was the second son of Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and Hariot Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava. His father was Governor General of Canada of in the 1870s and Viceroy and Governor-General of India in the 1880s and his mother was known for leading an initiative to improve medical care for women in British India.

His paternal grandparents were Price Blackwood, 4th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye and Helen Blackwood, Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye (a granddaughter of the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan), members of &quot;the Ascendancy&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s Anglo-Irish aristocracy. His maternal grandfather was Archibald Hamilton-Rowan of Killyleagh Castle (now Northern Ireland).
As a younger son, he was not expected to inherit the title, but on the death of his brother Archibald, Earl of Ava at the Siege of Ladysmith in the Second Boer War on 11 January 1900, he became the heir and assumed the courtesy title Earl of Ava himself before succeeding his father in 1902.

==Career==
From 1891 to 1918, he worked as a clerk at the Foreign Office, Second Secretary of the Diplomatic Service and a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for County Down.

==Personal life==

Lord Dufferin married Florence &quot;Flora&quot; Davis, a rich American singer who was the daughter of New York banker John Hagy Davis, of 24 Washington Square, New York City, in 1893. Together, they were the parents of three daughters:

* Lady Doris Gwendoline Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1895–1984), who married Captain Cecil Bernard Gunston, MC (1885–1934) of the Coldstream Guards, son of Major Bernard Gunston, formerly of the 5th Dragoon Guards, on 19 October 1922.
* Lady Ursula Florence Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (9 Feb 1899-13 Feb 1982), who married Arthur Swithin Newton Horne, formerly of The King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment and Government Secretary of the Federated Malay States (d. 1954).
* Lady Patricia Ethel Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1902–1983), who married Henry Russell, the former director of the Boston Opera Company and the son of musician Henry Russell, on 11 June 1926.

Lord Dufferin died from pneumonia on 7 February 1918 and was buried at the Dufferin ancestral seat of Clandeboye, County Down. The marquessate passed to his youngest brother, Lord Frederick Blackwood. Two years after his death his widow married again, to Richard George Penn Curzon, 4th Earl Howe, and died on 14 April 1925.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter, he was the grandfather of Hermione Hamilton Gunston (b. 1923), who married Lt. Col. Sir Walter Luttrell MC, and Sonia Helen Gunston JP (b. 1926), appointed Temporary Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II in 1967, and who married Thomas Fairfax, 13th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (d.1964) and had issue including Nicholas Fairfax, 14th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (b. 1956).

<text>Portrait Gallery is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1975.

== History ==

An early version of &quot;Someone Keeps Calling My Name&quot;, done in a folk-rock vein reminiscent of The Byrds, appeared on the obscure 1966 album Chapin recorded with his brothers, &quot;Chapin Music!&quot;. The main guitar riff (and entire arrangement) in this version is strikingly similar to The Blue Things&#x27; equally obscure 1966 track &quot;Doll House.&quot; Another version of the song was recorded for the 1972 album Sniper and Other Love Songs under the title of &quot;City Sweet&quot;, but didn&#x27;t make the final cut. It was later released in 2004 on the Heads &amp; Tales / Sniper &amp; Other Love Songs CD compilation.

The album artwork was designed and illustrated by Milton Glaser.

&quot;Record World&quot; said the single &quot;Tangled Up Puppet &quot;shows the lyricist at his incisive best.&quot;

<doc id="1055517" wikidata="Q580864" url="?curid=1055517" title="Economy of Africa">
<text>The economy of Africa consists of the trade, industry, agriculture, and human resources of the continent. , approximately 1.3 billion people were living in 53 countries in Africa. Africa is a resource-rich continent. Recent growth has been due to growth in sales, commodities, services, and manufacturing. West Africa, East Africa, Central Africa and Southern Africa in particular, are expected to reach a combined GDP of $29 trillion by 2050.

In March 2013, Africa was identified as the world&#x27;s poorest inhabited continent; however, the World Bank expects that most African countries will reach &quot;middle income&quot; status (defined as at least US$1,025 per person a year) by 2025 if current growth rates continue.
There are a number of reasons for Africa&#x27;s poor economy: historically, even though Africa had a number of empires trading with many parts of the world, many people lived in rural societies; in addition, European colonization and the later Cold War created political, economic and social instability.

However, , Africa was the world&#x27;s fastest-growing continent at 5.6% a year, and GDP is expected to rise by an average of over 6% a year between 2013 and 2023. In 2017, the African Development Bank reported Africa to be the world&#x27;s second-fastest growing economy, and estimates that average growth will rebound to 3.4% in 2017, while growth increased to 4.2% in 2018. Growth has been present throughout the continent, with over one-third of African countries posting 6% or higher growth rates, and another 40% growing between 4% and 6% per year. Several international business observers have named Africa as the future economic growth engine of the world. The African Union&#x27;s Agenda 2063 contains goals for furthering economic integration on the continent, having implemented a free-trade area in 2018. 

== List Of African countries by GDP ==

== History ==
For millennia, Africa&#x27;s economy has been diverse, driven by extensive trade routes that developed between cities and kingdoms. Some trade routes were overland, some involved navigating rivers, still others developed around port cities. Large African empires became wealthy due to their trade networks, for example Ancient Egypt, Nubia, Mali, Ashanti, the Oyo Empire and Ancient Carthage
. Some parts of Africa had close trade relationships with Arab kingdoms, and by the time of the Ottoman Empire, Africans had begun converting to Islam in large numbers. This development, along with the economic potential in finding a trade route to the Indian Ocean, brought the Portuguese to sub-Saharan Africa as an imperial force. Colonial interests created new industries to feed European appetites for goods such as palm oil, rubber, cotton, precious metals, spices, cash crops other goods, and integrated especially the coastal areas with the Atlantic economy.

A significant factor on economic development was the gain of human capital by the elite. Between the 14th and 20th century, it can be observed that in regions with more elite violence and hence higher chances to die at a younger age the elite did not invest much in education. Therefore, their numeracy (as a measure of human capital) tends to be lower than in less safe countries and vice versa. This can explain the difference in economic development between the African regions.•

=== 20th century upheaval ===
Following the independence of African countries during the 20th century, economic, political and social upheaval consumed much of the continent. An economic rebound among some countries has been evident in recent years, however.

The dawn of the African economic boom (which is in place since the 2000s) has been compared to the Chinese economic boom that had emerged in Asia since late 1970s. In 2013, Africa was home to seven of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing economies.

As of 2018, Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa by nominal GDP, followed by South Africa; in terms of PPP, Egypt is second biggest after Nigeria. Equatorial Guinea has Africa&#x27;s highest GDP per capita. Oil-rich countries such as Algeria, Libya and Gabon, and mineral-rich Botswana have emerged among the top economies since the 21st century, while Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo are potentially among the world&#x27;s richest nations by natural resources, but have sunk into the list of the world&#x27;s poorest nations due to pervasive political corruption, warfare, and emigration. Botswana stands out for its sustained strong and stable growth since independence.

== Current conditions ==

 The United Nations predicts Africa&#x27;s economic growth will reach 3.5% in 2018 and 3.7% in 2019. As of 2007, growth in Africa had surpassed that of East Asia. Data suggest parts of the continent are now experiencing fast growth, thanks to their resources and increasing political stability and &#x27;has steadily increased levels of peacefulness since 2007&#x27;. The World Bank reports the economy of Sub-Saharan African countries grew at rates that match or surpass global rates. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the improvement in the region&#x27;s aggregate growth is largely attributable to a recovery in Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa, three of Africa&#x27;s largest economies.

Sub-Saharan Africa was severely harmed when government revenue declined from 22% of GDP in 2011 to 17% in 2021. 15 African nations hold significant debt risk, and 7 are currently in financial crisis according to the IMF. The region went on to receive IMF Special Drawing Rights of $23 billion in 2021 to assist critical public spending.

In 2007, the fastest-growing nations in Africa included Mauritania with growth at 19.8%, Angola at 17.6%, Sudan at 9.6%, Mozambique at 7.9% and Malawi at 7.8%. Other fast growers included Rwanda, Mozambique, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia. Growth was dismal, negative or sluggish in many parts of Africa including Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo and Burundi.

As of a June 2010 report by McKinsey &amp; Company, the rate of return on investment in Africa was the highest in the developing world.

Debt relief is being addressed by some international institutions in the interests of supporting economic development in Africa. In 1996, the UN sponsored the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, subsequently taken up by the IMF, World Bank and the African Development Fund (AfDF) in the form of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). As of 2013, the initiative has given partial debt relief to 30 African countries.

In early 2021, the European Investment Bank, with the help of the Making Finance Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4A), surveyed 78 banks in Sub-Saharan Africa for the EIB Banking in Africa study. The banks that took part control nearly 30% of the continent&#x27;s assets. Almost two-thirds of Banks surveyed tightened lending rules, but more than 80% expanded their use of restructuring or loan moratoriums. Few banks were required to modify their employee levels, while slightly under one-third adjusted their prices. Approximately half of the answering banks had employee guarantees, the majority of which came from the central bank, the government, or an international financial institution.
Fiscal stimulus packages in African countries through to mid-2020 amounted to roughly 1–2% of GDP, with monetary stimulus amounting to about 2% of GDP. This is close to the IMF&#x27;s global average for low-income developing nations, which is around 2% of 2020 GDP over a one-year period from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing markets adopted a package worth around 4% of GDP, whereas advanced countries executed a package worth approximately 16% of GDP. As African nations struggled to address the health and economic repercussions of the pandemic, the average fiscal deficit throughout Africa increased from 5% of GDP in 2019 to over 8% in 2020. Due to a lack of fiscal headroom, the deficit resulted in increasing borrowing, which African countries have less capacity to absorb than other developed economies.

Northern and Southern African countries took the most total measures to address the COVID-19 recession, with an average of 14 measures per country. 34 African nations adopted steps to increase liquidity and lower borrowing costs, mostly through lowering the policy rate. South Africa, for example, has decreased policy rates by 200 basis points or more. The most used measure has been to modify the handling of nonperforming loans by lowering provisioning requirements. To help banks get through the COVID-19 recession, authorities limited dividends or other uses of earnings, permitted the temporary release of capital buffers, eased capital or liquidity requirements, or made other temporary adjustments to prudential standards.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, African private investment was steady in 2020, rising to $4.3 billion from $3.9 billion in 2019 as pipeline and current transactions were closed. For resource-intensive nations, real per capita GDP is anticipated to stay below pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024, with growth of barely 1% per year in 2022 and 2023. Before the pandemic, 2% or more of growth had been anticipated.

In 2023, East Africa had the largest crowding out pressures, whereas North Africa had the lowest. In a recent report, female-led businesses were found more likely to invest in innovation, export goods and services, and provide employee training. Over half of the banks studied in this report indicated a lower percentage of non-performing loans among enterprises run by women than males. Female-led firms also had lower rates of bankruptcy and were less likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 65% of banks in Africa were found to have a gender focused strategy in place. The crowding out index showed improvement in 2024, but it remains at a high level.

Africa’s share of global GDP has stagnated at 3.1% over the last two decades, with slow income convergence with developed nations. Despite better market conditions in 2024, access to finance remains a significant barrier to development. In sub-Saharan Africa, private sector credit dropped from 56% of GDP in 2007 to 36% in 2022. This decline is linked to slow growth in private capital stock, which lags behind other regions, potentially hindering private sector growth and industrialization.

A commonly cited barrier to development in Africa is the continent&#x27;s relatively low level of industrialisation. Inadequate infrastructure, a lack of skilled labor, and limited access to finance, are hindering Africa&#x27;s development. In recent years, Africa has faced declines in foreign direct investment, overseas development aid, portfolio investments, and cross-border bank flows. 

To meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, Africa requires an additional $194 billion in annual financing.
=== Trade growth ===
Trade has driven much of the growth in Africa&#x27;s economy in the early 21st century. China and India are increasingly important trade partners; 12.5% of Africa&#x27;s exports are to China, and 4% are to India, which accounts for 5% of China&#x27;s imports and 8% of India&#x27;s. The Group of Five (Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates) are another increasingly important market for Africa&#x27;s exports.

=== Future ===

Africa&#x27;s economy—with expanding trade, English language skills (official in many Sub-Saharan countries), improving literacy and education, availability of splendid resources and cheaper labour force—is expected to continue to perform better into the future. Trade between Africa and China stood at US$166 billion in 2011.

Africa will only experience a &quot;demographic dividend&quot; by 2035, when its young and growing labour force will have fewer children and retired people as dependents as a proportion of the population, making it more demographically comparable to the US and Europe. It is becoming a more educated labour force, with nearly half expected to have some secondary-level education by 2020. A consumer class is also emerging in Africa and is expected to keep booming. Africa has around 90 million people with household incomes exceeding $5,000, meaning that they can direct more than half of their income towards discretionary spending rather than necessities. This number could reach a projected 128 million by 2020.

During the President of the United States Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. A new program named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the U.S., was also unveiled by Obama.

With the introduction of the new economic growth and development plan introduced by the African Union members about 27 of its members who average some of the most developing economies of the continent will further boost economic social and political integration of the continent. The African Continental Free Trade Area will boost business activities between member states and within the continent. This will further reduce too much reliance on importation of finished products and raw materials in to the continent.

The gap between rich and poor countries is predicted to continue to grow over the coming decades.

=== Entrepreneurship ===
Entrepreneurship is key to growth. Governments will need to ensure business friendly regulatory environments in order to help foster innovation. In 2019, venture capital startup funding grew to 1.3 billion dollars, increasing rapidly. The causes are as of yet unclear, but education is certainly a factor.

=== Climate change ===
== Causes of the economic underdevelopment over the years ==
The seemingly intractable nature of Africa&#x27;s poverty has led to debate concerning its root causes. Endemic warfare and unrest, widespread corruption, and despotic regimes are both causes and effects of the continued economic problems. The decolonization of Africa was fraught with instability aggravated by cold war conflict. Since the mid-20th century, the Cold War and increased corruption, poor governance, disease and despotism have also contributed to Africa&#x27;s poor economy.

According to The Economist, the most important factors are government corruption, political instability, socialist economics, and protectionist trade policy.

=== Infrastructure ===

According to the researchers at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa.

It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa&#x27;s improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005 and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average 30–40% returns for telecommunications (ICT) investments, over 40% for electricity generation, and 80% for roads.

In Africa, it is argued that to meet the MDGs by 2015, infrastructure investments would need to reach about 15% of GDP (around $93 billion a year). Currently, the source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by state spending, others by overseas development aid (ODA) and yet others by private investors. In sub-Saharan Africa, the state spends around $9.4 billion out of a total of $24.9 billion.

In irrigation, SSA states represent almost all spending; in transport and energy a majority of investment is state spending; in Information and communication technologies and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, aid, the private sector and non-OECD financiers between them exceed state spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased from $7 billion (2002) to $27 billion (2009). China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor.

=== Colonialism ===
The principal aim of colonial rule in Africa by European colonial powers was to exploit natural wealth in the African continent at a low cost. Some writers, such as Walter Rodney in his book &quot;How Europe Underdeveloped Africa&quot;, argue that these colonial policies are directly responsible for many of Africa&#x27;s modern problems. Critics of colonialism charge colonial rule with injuring African pride, self-worth and belief in themselves. Other post-colonial scholars, most notably Frantz Fanon continuing along this line, have argued that the true effects of colonialism are psychological and that domination by a foreign power creates a lasting sense of inferiority and subjugation that creates a barrier to growth and innovation. Such arguments posit that a new generation of Africans free of colonial thought and mindset is emerging and that this is driving economic transformation.

Historians L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan have argued that Africa probably benefited from colonialism on balance. Although it had its faults, colonialism was probably &quot;one of the most efficacious engines for cultural diffusion in world history&quot;. These views, however, are controversial and are rejected by some who, on balance, see colonialism as bad. The economic historian David Kenneth Fieldhouse has taken a kind of middle position, arguing that the effects of colonialism were actually limited and their main weakness wasn&#x27;t in deliberate underdevelopment but in what it failed to do. Niall Ferguson agrees with his last point, arguing that colonialism&#x27;s main weaknesses were &quot;sins of omission&quot;. Analysis of the economies of African states finds that independent states such as Liberia and Ethiopia did not have better economic performance than their post-colonial counterparts. In particular the economic performance of former British colonies was better than both independent states and former French colonies.

Africa&#x27;s relative poverty predates colonialism. Jared Diamond argues in &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; that Africa has always been poor due to a number of ecological factors affecting historical development. These factors include low population density, the tsetse fly, malaria, lack of navigable rivers, and the north–south orientation of Africa&#x27;s geography. However Diamond&#x27;s theories have been criticized by some including James Morris Blaut as a form of environmental determinism. Historian John K. Thornton argues that sub-Saharan Africa was relatively wealthy and technologically advanced until at least the seventeenth century. Some scholars who believe that Africa was generally poorer than the rest of the world throughout its history make exceptions for certain parts of Africa. Acemoglue and Robinson, for example, argue that most of Africa has always been relatively poor, but &quot;Aksum, Ghana, Songhay, Mali, [and] Great Zimbabwe ... were probably as developed as their contemporaries anywhere in the world.&quot; A number of people including Rodney and Joseph E. Inikori have argued that the poverty of Africa at the onset of the colonial period was principally due to the demographic loss associated with the slave trade as well as other related societal shifts. Others such as J. D. Fage and David Eltis have rejected this view.

=== Language diversity ===
African countries suffer from communication difficulties caused by language diversity. Greenberg&#x27;s diversity index is the chance that two randomly selected people would have different mother tongues. Out of the most diverse 25 countries according to this index, 18 (72%) are African. This includes 12 countries for which Greenberg&#x27;s diversity index exceeds 0.9, meaning that a pair of randomly selected people will have less than 10% chance of having the same mother tongue. However, the primary language of government, political debate, academic discourse, and administration is often the language of the former colonial powers, English, French, Arabic, or Portuguese.

=== Trade-based theories ===
Dependency theory asserts that the wealth and prosperity of the superpowers and their allies in Europe, North America and East Asia is dependent upon the poverty of the rest of the world, including Africa. Economists who subscribe to this theory believe that poorer regions must break their trading ties with the developed world in order to prosper.

Less radical theories suggest that economic protectionism in developed countries hampers Africa&#x27;s growth. When developing countries have harvested agricultural produce at low cost, they generally do not export as much as would be expected. Abundant farm subsidies and high import tariffs in the developed world, most notably those set by Japan, the European Union&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy, and the United States Department of Agriculture, are thought to be the cause. Although these subsidies and tariffs have been gradually reduced, they remain high.

Local conditions also affect exports; state over-regulation in several African nations can prevent their own exports from becoming competitive. Research in Public Choice economics such as that of Jane Shaw suggest that protectionism operates in tandem with heavy State intervention combining to depress economic development. Farmers subject to import and export restrictions cater to localized markets, exposing them to higher market volatility and fewer opportunities. When subject to uncertain market conditions, farmers press for governmental intervention to suppress competition in their markets, resulting in competition being driven out of the market. As competition is driven out of the market, farmers innovate less and grow less food further undermining economic performance.

=== Governance ===

Although Africa and Asia had similar levels of income in the 1960s, Asia has since outpaced Africa, with the exception of a few extremely poor and war-torn countries like Afghanistan and Yemen. One school of economists argues that Asia&#x27;s superior economic development lies in local investment. Corruption in Africa consists primarily of extracting economic rent and moving the resulting financial capital overseas instead of investing at home; the stereotype of African dictators with Swiss bank accounts is often accurate. University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers estimate that from 1970 to 1996, capital flight from 30 sub-Saharan countries totalled $187bn, exceeding those nations&#x27; external debts. Authors Leonce Ndikumana and James K. Boyce estimate that from 1970 to 2008, capital flight from 33 sub-Saharan countries totalled $700bn.

Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko became notorious for corruption, nepotism, and the embezzlement of between US$4 billion and $15 billion during his reign. Socialist governments influenced by Marxism, and the land reform they have enacted, have also contributed to economic stagnation in Africa. For example, the regime of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, particularly the land seizures from white farmers, led to the collapse of the country&#x27;s agricultural economy, which had formerly been one of Africa&#x27;s strongest; Mugabe had been previously supported by the USSR and China during the Zimbabwe War of Liberation. Tanzania was left as one of the world&#x27;s poorest and most aid-dependent nations, and has taken decades to recover. Since the abolition of the socialist one-party state in 1992 and the transition to democracy, Tanzania has experienced rapid economic growth, with growth of 6.5% in 2017.

=== Foreign aid ===
Food shipments in case of dire local shortage are generally uncontroversial; but as Amartya Sen has shown, most famines involve a local lack of income rather than of food. In such situations, food aid—as opposed to financial aid—has the effect of destroying local agriculture and serves mainly to benefit Western agribusiness which are vastly overproducing food as a result of agricultural subsidies.

Historically, food aid is more highly correlated with excess supply in Western countries than with the needs of developing countries. Foreign aid has been an integral part of African economic development since the 1980s.

The aid model has been criticized for supplanting trade initiatives. Growing evidence shows that foreign aid has made the continent poorer. One of the biggest critics of the aid development model is economist Dambisa Moyo (a Zambian economist based in the US), who introduced the Dead Aid model, which highlights how foreign aid has been a deterrent for local development.

Today, Africa faces the problem of attracting foreign aid in areas where there is potential for high income from demand. It is in need of more economic policies and active participation in the world economy. As globalization has heightened the competition for foreign aid among developing countries, Africa has been trying to improve its struggle to receive foreign aid by taking more responsibility at the regional and international level. In addition, Africa has created the ‘Africa Action Plan’ in order to obtain new relationships with development partners to share responsibilities regarding discovering ways to receive aid from foreign investors.

== Trade blocs and multilateral organizations ==
The African Union is the largest international economic grouping on the continent. The confederation&#x27;s goals include the creation of a free trade area (established in 2018), a customs union (African Union Passport), a single market, a central bank (African Central Bank), and a common currency (African Monetary Union), thereby establishing an economic and monetary union. The African Investment Bank is meant to stimulate development. The AU plans also include a transitional African Monetary Fund leading to an African Central Bank. Some parties support development of an even more unified United States of Africa.

International monetary and banking unions include:
* Central Bank of West African States
* Bank of Central African States
* Common Monetary Area
Major economic unions are shown in the chart below.

=== Regional economic organizations ===
During the 1960s, Ghanaian politician Kwame Nkrumah promoted economic and political union of African countries, with the goal of independence. Since then, objectives, and organizations, have multiplied. Recent decades have brought efforts at various degrees of regional economic integration. Trade between African states accounts for only 11% of Africa&#x27;s total commerce as of 2012, around five times less than in Asia. Most of this intra-Africa trade originates from South Africa and most of the trade exports coming out of South Africa goes to abutting countries in Southern Africa.

There are currently eight regional organizations that assist with economic development in Africa:

== Economic variants and indicators ==

After an initial rebound from the 2009 world economic crisis, Africa&#x27;s economy was undermined in the year 2011 by the Arab uprisings. The continent&#x27;s growth fell back from 5% in 2010 to 3.4% in 2011. With the recovery of North African economies and sustained improvement in other regions, growth across the continent is expected to accelerate to 4.5% in 2012 and 4.8% in 2013. Short-term problems for the world economy remain as Europe confronts its debt crisis. Commodity prices—crucial for Africa—have declined from their peak due to weaker demand and increased supply, and some could fall further. But prices are expected to remain at levels favourable for African exporter.

=== Regions ===
Economic activity has rebounded across Africa. However, the pace of recovery was uneven among groups of countries and subregions. Oil-exporting countries generally expanded more strongly than oil-importing countries. West Africa and East Africa were the two best-performing subregions in 2010.

Intra-African trade has been slowed by protectionist policies among countries and regions, and remains low at 17 percent, compared to Europe, where intra-regional trade is at 69 percent. Despite this, trade between countries belonging to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a particularly strong economic region, grew six-fold over the past decade up to 2012. Ghana and Kenya, for example, have developed markets within the region for construction materials, machinery, and finished products, quite different from the mining and agriculture products that make up the bulk of their international exports.

The African Ministers of Trade agreed in 2010 to create a Pan-Africa Free Trade Zone. This would reduce countries&#x27; tariffs on imports and increase intra-African trade, and it is hoped, the diversification of the economy overall.


=== African nations ===

== Economic sectors and industries ==
Because Africa&#x27;s export portfolio remains predominantly based on raw material, its export earnings are contingent on commodity price fluctuations. This exacerbates the continent&#x27;s susceptibility to external shocks and bolsters the need for export diversification. Trade in services, mainly travel and tourism, continued to rise in year 2012, underscoring the continent&#x27;s strong potential in this sphere.

=== Agriculture ===

48% of working people in Africa work in agriculture, the highest in the world. The situation whereby African nations export crops to the West while millions on the continent starve has been blamed on the economic policies of the developed countries. These advanced nations protect their own agricultural sectors with high import tariffs and offer government subsidies to their farmers. which many contend leads the overproduction of such commodities as grain, cotton and milk. The impact of agricultural subsidies in developed countries upon developing-country farmers and international development is well documented. Agricultural subsidies can help drive prices down to benefit consumers, but also mean that unsubsidised developing-country farmers have a more difficult time competing in the world market; and the effects on poverty are particularly negative when subsidies are provided for crops that are also grown in developing countries since developing-country farmers must then compete directly with subsidised developed-country farmers, for example in cotton and sugar. The IFPRI has estimated in 2003 that the impact of subsidies costs developing countries $24 billion in lost incomes going to agricultural and agro-industrial production; and more than $40Bn is displaced from net agricultural exports. The result of this is that the global price of such products is continually reduced until Africans are unable to compete, except for cash crops that do not grow easily in a northern climate.

In recent years countries such as Brazil, which has experienced progress in agricultural production, have agreed to share technology with Africa to increase agricultural production in the continent to make it a more viable trade partner. Increased investment in African agricultural technology in general has the potential to reduce poverty in Africa. The demand market for African cocoa has experienced a price boom in 2008. The Nigerian, South African and Ugandan governments have targeted policies to take advantage of the increased demand for certain agricultural products and plan to stimulate agricultural sectors. The African Union has plans to heavily invest in African agriculture and the situation is closely monitored by the UN.

Ticks are a constant pressure on the continent&#x27;s livestock. Although acaricides have been commonly used by farmers here, they are becoming less effective. Tick vaccines are under development and may fill this void.

=== Energy ===

Africa has significant resources for generating energy in several forms (hydroelectric, reserves of petroleum and gas, coal production, uranium production, renewable energy such as solar, wind and geothermal). The lack of development and infrastructure means that little of this potential is actually in use today. The largest consumers of electric power in Africa are South Africa, Libya, Namibia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe, which each consume between 1000 and 5000 KWh/m2 per person, in contrast with African states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Tanzania, where electricity consumption per person is negligible.

Petroleum and petroleum products are the main export of 14 African countries. Petroleum and petroleum products accounted for a 46.6% share of Africa&#x27;s total exports in 2010; the second largest export of Africa as a whole is natural gas, in its gaseous state and as liquified natural gas, accounting for a 6.3% share of Africa&#x27;s exports. Only South Africa is using nuclear power commercially.

=== Infrastructure ===
Lack of infrastructure creates barriers for African businesses. Although it has many ports, a lack of supporting transportation infrastructure adds 30–40% to costs, in contrast to Asian ports.

Railway projects were important in mining districts from the late 19th century. Large railway and road projects characterize the late 19th century. Railroads were emphasized in the colonial era, and roads in &#x27;post-colonial&#x27; times. Jedwab &amp; Storeygard find that in 1960–2015 there were strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development. Influential political include pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.

Many large infrastructure projects are underway across Africa. By far, most of these projects are in the production and transportation of electric power. Many other projects include paved highways, railways, airports, and other construction.

Telecommunications infrastructure is also a growth area in Africa. Although Internet penetration lags other continents, it has still reached 9%. As of 2011, it was estimated that 500,000,000 mobile phones of all types were in use in Africa, including 15,000,000 &quot;smart phones&quot;.

=== Mining and drilling ===


The mineral industry of Africa is one of the largest mineral industries in the world. Africa is the second biggest continent, with 30 million km2 of land, which implies large quantities of resources. For many African countries, mineral exploration and production constitute significant parts of their economies and remain keys to future economic growth. Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first or second in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium.

African mineral reserves rank first or second for bauxite, cobalt, diamonds, phosphate rocks, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Many other minerals are also present in quantity. The 2005 share of world production from African soil is the following: bauxite 9%; aluminium 5%; chromite 44%; cobalt 57%; copper 5%; gold 21%; iron ore 4%; steel 2%; lead (Pb) 3%; manganese 39%; zinc 2%; cement 4%; natural diamond 46%; graphite 2%; phosphate rock 31%; coal 5%; mineral fuels (including coal) &amp; petroleum 13%; uranium 16%.

Since Africa is home to large reserves of the minerals needed for the ongoing energy transition, i.e. the transition to renewable energy technologies, the predicted increase in global demand for these critical minerals could become a driver of sustainable economic development on the continent, not least for the mineral-rich countries of Africa. The African Union has outlined a policy framework, the Africa Mining Vision, to leverage the continent’s mineral reserves in pursuit of sustainable development and socio-economic transformation. A key ambition in this vision is to transform Africa&#x27;s economies from today&#x27;s high levels of commodity export to a larger share of industrial manufacturing of higher value-added products, an ambition that will require investments in capacity building, research and development.

=== Manufacturing ===
Both the African Union and the United Nations have outlined plans in modern years on how Africa can help itself industrialize and develop significant manufacturing sectors to levels proportional to the African economy in the 1960s with 21st-century technology. This focus on growth and diversification of manufacturing and industrial production, as well as diversification of agricultural production, has fueled hopes that the 21st century will prove to be a century of economic and technological growth for Africa. This hope, coupled with the rise of new leaders in Africa in the future, inspired the term &quot;the African Century&quot;, referring to the 21st century potentially being the century when Africa&#x27;s vast untapped labor, capital, and resource potentials might become a world player.
This hope in manufacturing and industry is helped by the boom in communications technology and local mining industry in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Namibia has attracted industrial investments in recent years and South Africa has begun offering tax incentives to attract foreign direct investment projects in manufacturing.

Countries such as Mauritius have plans for developing new &quot;green technology&quot; for manufacturing. Developments such as this have huge potential to open new markets for African countries as the demand for alternative &quot;green&quot; and clean technology is predicted to soar in the future as global oil reserves dry up and fossil fuel-based technology becomes less economically viable.

Nigeria in recent years has been embracing industrialization, It currently has an indigenous vehicle manufacturing company, &quot;Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM)&quot; which manufactures Rapid Transit Buses, Trucks and SUVs with an upcoming introduction of Cars. Their various brands of vehicle are currently available in Nigeria, Ghana and other West African Nations. Nigeria also has few Electronic manufacturers like Zinox, the first Branded Nigerian Computer and Electronic gadgets (like tablet PCs) manufacturers. In 2013, Nigeria introduced a policy regarding import duty on vehicles to encourage local manufacturing companies in the country. In this regard, some foreign vehicle manufacturing companies like Nissan have made known their plans to have manufacturing plants in Nigeria. Apart from Electronics and vehicles, most consumer, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, building materials, textiles, home tools, plastics and so on are also manufactured in the country and exported to other west African and African countries. Nigeria is currently the largest manufacturer of cement in Sub-saharan Africa. and Dangote Cement Factory, Obajana is the largest cement factory in sub-saharan Africa. Ogun is considered to be Nigeria&#x27;s industrial hub (as most factories are located in Ogun and even more companies are moving there), followed by Lagos.

The manufacturing sector is small but growing in East Africa. The main industries are textile and clothing, leather processing, agribusiness, chemical products, electronics and vehicles. East African countries like Uganda also produce motorcycles for the domestic market.

=== Investment and banking ===

Africa&#x27;s US$107 billion financial services industry will log impressive growth for the rest of the decade as more banks target the continent&#x27;s emerging middle class. The banking sector has been experiencing record growth, among others due to various technological innovations.

China and India have showed increasing interest in emerging African economies in the 21st century. Reciprocal investment between Africa and China increased dramatically in recent years amidst the current world financial crisis.

The increased investment in Africa by China has attracted the attention of the European Union and has provoked talks of competitive investment by the EU. Members of the African diaspora abroad, especially in the EU and the United States, have increased efforts to use their businesses to invest in Africa and encourage African investment abroad in the European economy.

Remittances from the African diaspora and rising interest in investment from the West will be especially helpful for Africa&#x27;s least developed and most devastated economies, such as Burundi, Togo and Comoros. However, experts lament the high fees involved in sending remittances to Africa due to a duopoly of Western Union and MoneyGram that is controlling Africa&#x27;s remittance market, making Africa is the most expensive cash transfer market in the world. According to some experts, the high processing fees involved in sending money to Africa are hampering African countries&#x27; development.

Remittances continue to be the most important source of external financial flows to Africa, accounting for 3.8% of GDP in 2021. However, only approximately 30% of it is dedicated to economic activities, the majority of which are in the informal sector, limiting its potential for productive transformation.

Angola has announced interests in investing in the EU, Portugal in particular. South Africa has attracted increasing attention from the United States as a new frontier of investment in manufacture, financial markets and small business, as has Liberia in recent years under their new leadership.

There are two African currency unions: the West African Banque Centrale des États de l&#x27;Afrique de l&#x27;Ouest (BCEAO) and the Central African Banque des États de l&#x27;Afrique Centrale (BEAC). Both use the CFA franc as their legal tender. The idea of a single currency union across Africa has been floated, and plans exist to have it established by 2020, though many issues, such as bringing continental inflation rates below 5 percent, remain hurdles in its finalization.

==== Stock exchanges ====
As of 2012, Africa has 23 stock exchanges, twice as many as it had 20 years earlier. Nonetheless, African stock exchanges still account for less than 1% of the world&#x27;s stock exchange activity. The top ten stock exchanges in Africa by stock capital are (amounts are given in billions of United States dollars): but nowadays there are around 29 stock exchanges in Africa:

* South Africa (82.88)(2014)
* Egypt ($73.04 billion (30 November 2014 est.))
* Morocco (5.18)
* Nigeria (5.11) (Actually has a market capitalisation value of $39.27 Bln)
* Kenya (1.33)
* Tunisia (0.88)
* BRVM (regional stock exchange whose members include Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo: 6.6)
* Mauritius (0.55)
* Botswana (0.43)
* Ghana (.38)

Between 2009 and 2012, a total of 72 companies were launched on the stock exchanges of 13 African countries.

<text>Burt Lake is a lake in Cheboygan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The western shore of the lake is on the boundary with Emmet County. The lake is named after William Austin Burt, who, together with John Mullett, made a federal survey of the area from 1840 to 1843.

The lake is approximately long from north to south, about at its widest, and at its deepest. Major inflows to the lake are the Maple River, which connects with nearby Douglas Lake, the Crooked River, which connects with nearby Crooked Lake, the Sturgeon River which enters the lake near the point where the Indian River flows out of the lake into nearby Mullett Lake and the Little Carp River which enters on the northern end of the lake.

The lake is part of the Inland Waterway, by which one can boat from Crooked Lake several miles (km) east of Petoskey on the Little Traverse Bay of Lake Michigan across the northern tip of the lower peninsula&#x27;s so-called mitten to Cheboygan on Lake Huron. Along with nearby Mullett Lake and Black Lake, it is noted for its population of Lake Sturgeon, which briefly held the record of largest sturgeon caught in the USA.

YMCA Camp Al-Gon-Quian and Burt Lake State Park are both located on the southern shore of the lake. The unincorporated community of Burt Lake is on the southwest shore on M-68. Interstate 75 passes to the east of the lake, with two interchanges near the south end of the lake at the unincorporated community of Indian River.

<doc id="1055530" wikidata="Q7968289" url="?curid=1055530" title="Wapping Tunnel">
<text>Wapping or Edge Hill Tunnel in Liverpool, England, is a tunnel route from the Edge Hill junction in the east of the city to the Liverpool south end docks formerly used by trains on the Liverpool-Manchester line railway. The tunnel alignment is roughly east to west. The tunnel was designed by George Stephenson with construction between 1826 and 1829 to enable goods services to operate between Liverpool docks and all locations up to Manchester, as part of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was the first transport tunnel in the world to be bored under a city. The tunnel is long, running downhill from the western end of the long Cavendish cutting at Edge Hill in the east of the city, to Park Lane Goods Station near Wapping Dock in the west. The Edge Hill portal is near the former Crown Street Station goods yard. The tunnel passes beneath the Merseyrail Northern Line tunnel approximately a quarter of a mile south of Liverpool Central underground station.

==History==
Liverpool is built on an escarpment running down to the River Mersey. The original proposal for the railway out of Liverpool was a route north along the docks and riverbank. This route proved problematic with local landowners. The new route entering the city centre from the east required considerable engineering works in addition to the tunnel. The 1-in-48 gradient of the tunnel was much too steep for the power of the steam locomotives of the day. A large stationary steam engine was installed at the Cavendish cutting at Edge Hill in a short tunnel bored into the rock face on the side of the cutting, near a decorative Moorish Arch spanning the cutting. Goods wagons were hauled by rope up from the Park Lane goods station at the south end docks. The goods wagons were hitched to locomotives at the Edge Hill junction for the continuing journey to all locations from Liverpool to Manchester. The tunnel opened in 1830 and closed on 15 May 1972.

The dockside portal to the tunnel is clearly visible on Kings Dock Street. This was the middle of three short exit tunnels at the western end, which met in a short open ventilation cutting between Park Lane and Upper Frederick Street. The quoted length of includes both the main tunnel and the short exit tunnel.

The Edge Hill entrance is still open to the atmosphere, but is not accessible to the public. The portal is the central of three tunnels at the western end of the Cavendish cutting. The right hand tunnel is the original 1829 tunnel into Crown Street Station. The left hand tunnel is the later 1846 tunnel into the Crown Street goods yard. This tunnel currently has tracks, for use as a headshunt and locomotive run-round for goods trains. However, artwork from before the third tunnel was constructed shows that a portal was already present from the outset - this was purely for architectural symmetry and is, in fact, a store room.

Other visible evidence of the tunnel still exists, in the form of three imposing red-brick ventilation towers. One is on the landscaped park between Crown Street and Smithdown Lane, one on Blackburne Place (&quot;illustration&quot;), and one close to Grenville Street South. There were at least two others that were later demolished, one adjacent to Great George Street, and one by Myrtle Street.

== Plans for partial reinstatement of tunnel ==

In the 1970s, during planning work for the Merseyrail underground in Liverpool city centre, there were two proposals to use parts of the Wapping Tunnel or Waterloo Tunnel (Victoria Tunnel) to connect Liverpool Central underground station and Edge Hill junction. During the construction of the Merseyrail network in the 1970s a part of the new tunnel south out of Central Station passed over the Wapping Tunnel at right angles. The new tunnel dropped into the upper part of the Wapping tunnel reducing its height. This would require lowering the floor of the tunnel at this point to allow trains to pass. When the junction on the Northern Line tunnel south of Central station was built in the late 1970s, two header tunnels were constructed to cater for branching into the Wapping Tunnel. 

In May 2007 it was reported that chief executive of Merseytravel, Neil Scales, had prepared a report outlining the possibilities for reuse of the tunnel. The November 2016 refresh of Mersytravel&#x27;s Long Term Strategy references a &quot;Wapping Tunnel Scheme&quot; in Network Rail&#x27;s CP7 period. Merseytravel hope to re-use the tunnel to create new underground connections into burrowing junctions south of Liverpool Central station on the Northern Line to allow trains to run between Central station and Edge Hill station and beyond.

Merseytravel commissioned a feasibility study into the re-opening of the tunnel which was completed in May 2016. The study was focused on using the Wapping Tunnel to connect the Northern and City Lines together and the possible creation of a new station along the route to serve the city&#x27;s Knowledge Quarter. The report found that the Wapping Tunnel was in good condition though suffered from flooding in places and would require some remedial work, however the concept of re-opening the tunnel was viable.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* 28 September 1907, Brakesman John Fairbrother, was working a train to the docks. The train stopped in the tunnel and as Fairbrother went to lift some of the wagon brakes he slipped bruising his back and knees. While he was not injured further, lifting the brakes caused the train to descend uncontrollably down the tracks damaging 13 wagons and 4 brake vans.

<text>Railnews is a national monthly newspaper and news website for the British railway network.

==Content==
&quot;Railnews&quot; concentrates on issues important to employees of the railway industry, such as investment, careers, changes to industry structure, political developments, industrial relations and other trade union matters. It also maintains a focus on the people of the rail industry, rather than the companies alone. As a trade title covering the modern industry, it is not designed for railway enthusiasts or the heritage railway market.

The ethos of &quot;Railnews&quot; is to be &quot;dispassionate, objective and accurate&quot;. Following this, &quot;Railnews&quot; never carries unmarked advertorials, although much of its advertising revenue does come from major railway suppliers and operators.

==History==

&quot;Railnews&quot;, in the early days spelt &#x27;Rail News&#x27;, was originally the house newspaper of British Railways, published by the British Railways Board. It first appeared in 1963 under the editorship of Keith Horrox with a price of 6d, replacing the former magazines which had been produced for each railway Region, although Regional &#x27;slip&#x27; pages continued for many years. From 1978 to October 1996 it was issued free to all employees of British Rail. An attempt to sell it as a result of the privatisation of British Rail was unsuccessful and production ceased in October 1996. In February 1997 the title was revived by some former BR managers, with Sir William McAlpine as Chairman and Cyril Bleasdale as Managing Director. Both maintained these positions until their deaths. The managing director is now David Longstaff. Only four months went by between the ending of the BR version and the launch in March 1997 of its independent successor.

==Today==
&quot;Railnews&quot; is no longer a house journal with a particular stance to maintain and, although fully supportive of the industry it serves, it carries objective, balanced reports. Distributed to both individual subscribers and large railway companies (who have corporate subscriptions) it penetrates the entire industry from trackside to boardroom.

The newspaper and website were both fully redesigned in February 2012, bringing a new, cleaner, more modern look to the title. Since September 2009 the Managing Editor has been former BBC journalist Sim Harris. He succeeded Paul Whiting, who has retired.

<text>Cham is a municipality in the canton of Zug in Switzerland.

==Location==

Cham is located on the northern shore of Lake Zug, northwest of the cantonal capital of Zug. Surrounding Cham, Steinhausen is to the east, Hünenberg is to the west, Lake Zug is south, and Maschwanden and Knonau in the Canton of Zürich are to the north. The town has an area of . The train station is located above sea level and the highest point in town is above sea level.

The town is located at the mouth of the Lorze river, with two sections (Kirchbühl and Städtli) located on both sides of the river. Cham also includes a number of smaller villages; Enikon, Lindencham, Friesencham, Hagendorn, Rumentikon, Niederwil, Oberwil and Bibersee.

Cham has an area, , of . Of this area, 63.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while 13.2% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 21.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.8%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).

==History==

The shores of Lake Zug were populated at least 6000 years ago with several sites in Cham. A number of finds in the village of Oberwil in Cham show that there were a number of middle and late Bronze Age settlements in Cham. In 1944–45 a large, unique Roman watermill with multiple waterwheels was found in the village of Hagendorn. A Roman warehouse from the same era has been discovered in the village of Heiligkreuz.

The city&#x27;s name, Cham, means &#x27;village&#x27; and refers to a large Celtic settlement on the shore of Lake Zug. Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, there was also an Alamannic settlement, but only place names remain. The first mention of the town (as &quot;Chama&quot;) occurred on 16 April 858 when King Louis the German gave the town to his daughter, Hildegard, the abbess of the Fraumünster Abbey in Zürich. The town was administered by a variety of nobles and bailiffs over the following centuries.

In 1360 the town was granted a charter as well as the rights to hold a market and enroll citizens. This charter, granted by Charles IV, was given to Gottfried von Hünenberg as the ruler of the city. The Habsburgs, attempting to maintain their influence in the region following the loss of Zug to the Swiss Confederation in 1364, bought part of the town in 1366 and completely bought the Hünenberg family out in 1370. However, following the decisive Habsburg defeat in the Battle of Sempach in 1386, Cham was taken by Zug and Schwyz. The Habsburgs had pawned the town to a citizen of Zürich, Götz Mülner, and so Zug was not able to completely own the city until the loan was repaid in 1415. The city would remain under the control of the vogt or bailiff of Zug until the French invasion of 1798.

In the 16th century, the reform-minded preacher Jost Müller unsuccessfully attempted to bring the Reformation to Cham.
Following the 1798 invasion of Switzerland and the collapse of the Old Swiss Confederacy, Cham finally became an independent town; although the citizens still paid some taxes and tithes to Zug until 1816 when most were abolished and 1872 when the last one ended.

The rapid industrialization of the second half of the 19th century caused a population boom in Cham and the surrounding villages. The population doubled between 1850 and 1880 and continued to grow at a slightly slower rate afterward. The first urban plan and construction ordinances came into being in 1950. A goal of the planning was to maintain the character of the industrial part of the city, becoming a center for the surrounding villages and preserve the parkland along the lake. In 1991 the town was awarded the Wakker Prize for the preservation of its architectural heritage. By 1990 Cham was the third largest city in the canton of Zug.

==Demographics==
Cham has a population (as of ) of . 19.6% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years, the population has grown at a rate of 14%. Most of the population () speaks German (85.7%), with Serbo-Croatian being second most common (3.1%) and Italian being third (1.9%).

In the 2007 federal election, the most popular party was the SVP which received 31.3% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the CVP (22.2%), the FDP (18.2%) and the Green Party (17.8%).

In Cham, about 76.4% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either a university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;).

The historical population was

==Sights and recreation==
This small town has its own medical clinic, institutions for primary and secondary education, kindergarten and a public green with sports facilities available all year round.

Cham also provides visitors and residents alike with hotel services, congress hall, churches (Roman Catholic and Reformed), a marina, and a castle (St. Andreas). The church of St. James is a late Baroque building from the 18th century, with a late Gothic tower from the 15th century. There are several well-established restaurants providing a variety of local and international cuisines.

===Heritage sites of national significance===
There are a number of Swiss heritage sites of national significance in Cham. These include the &quot;Eslen&quot;, a Neolithic lake shore settlement, the church and Cistercian convent at Frauenthal, the Castle of St. Andreas, two buildings in the old city, and the brickyard.

==Transportation==
Cham is located from Zug and is centrally located between Luzern () and Zürich (). The Swiss Federal Railways line from Luzern through Thalwil to Zürich occasionally stops in Cham. The E41 highway passes near Cham. The city can also be reached by bus from Zug and in the summer by boat.

==Industry==
Cham has an unemployment rate of 2.05%. , there were 206 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 68 businesses involved in this sector. 2,151 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 179 businesses in this sector. 4,900 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 783 businesses in this sector.

For most of Cham&#x27;s history, farming and light industry were the main sources of income. The Lorze River has always been a key for the development of the city. The first recorded watermill in Cham was built in 1279. About 1641 a dyeing and bleaching operation was built along the river. In 1657 a paper mill was built, which partly mechanized in the 1720s and had the first paper machine in 1840. Following several mergers and expansions, this factory became the first Swiss wood pulp factory. In the 20th century it became Papierfabrik Cham AG, the largest company in Cham.

In 1863, a cotton spinning and weaving company opened in Cham. Following a major fire in 1888 the factory closed, but the dormitories for child laborers for the factory are now a children&#x27;s home.

In 1864, Cham was connected to the Zürich-Lucerne train line. In 1866, the American Page family founded the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham to take advantage of this new rail line. The company initially produced only condensed milk, but soon grew to produce other milk products. In 1905, it merged with the Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé Company to form Nestlé. The company expanded rapidly; by 1907, they had over 1,000 milkmen in 44 locations. In 1913 a conflict over money between the factory and the milkmen led to a strike and weakened the company. Following World War I, the company faced financial crisis and began to shut down production in Cham.

In 1905, one-third of the population worked in agriculture, while half worked in industry. By 1955, nearly two-thirds of the population worked in industry. In the following year, industrial jobs decreased while the central location and low taxes encouraged a growth in service industries. In 2001, 80% of the businesses and 58% of the jobs are in service industries, while 40% are in manufacturing.

==Sport==
SC Cham is the municipality&#x27;s football club.

<text>Dr. Massouda Jalal (داکتر مسعوده جلال) is the first woman in the history of Afghanistan who ran for the Office of the President of Afghanistan in 2002, 2004, and again in 2019. Dr. Jalal emerged as a leading voice of Afghan women after her election as the Representative to the 2002 Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) as she became one of the frontrunners for the position of Interim President of Afghanistan, opposite to ex-president Hamid Karzai.

Serving as the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs (2004-2006) in the cabinet of government of Afghanistan and the head of the Commission for the Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW), she left behind a string of legacies that includes the framework for the National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA), a ten-year plan for women to liberate Afghan women from poverty and promote their participation in public life.

Between 2001-2004, Dr. Jalal also served as the only Afghan woman as the member of the “Peace Delegation of Afghanistan&quot;. Before joining politics, she worked as a Professor at the Kabul Medical University, and she has also worked in leadership positions in the UN World Food Programme, UNHCR, and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Afghanistan. She is fluent in Persian, Pashto, English, Dutch, and Hindi/Urdu and moderately fluent in French and German languages. 

==Early life and education==
Born to a middle-class family in Kapisa Province of Afghanistan, one of seven children, Jalal moved to Kabul to attend high school. After scoring the second highest marks at the national level in the National College Entrance Exam of Afghanistan (Konkor), she attended the Kabul Medical University as a first generation high school and college student, where she later joined the faculty. Amidst raging war in the early 1990s, she and her academic colleagues founded the Human Rights Commission which reported human rights violations to the UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan. She was a member of the faculty in the Kabul Medical University until 1996, when the Taliban government had her removed. After her removal from the Kabul Medical University&#x27;s faculty, she worked as a National Senior Program Officer and Head of Women&#x27;s Department for United Nations-World Food Programme (UN-WFP), Consultant to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Senior Program Officer for the United Nation&#x27;s Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Under the Taliban rule, her efforts for women and girls’ right to education and work led her to get arrested for political reasons. She was released from prison through United Nation Headquarter&#x27;s intervention. Her husband, Professor Dr. Faizullah Jalal, has been a professor of Law and Political Science at Kabul University for the past 30 years and they have three children. Taliban security service officers arrested Professor Faizullah Jalal on 8 January 2022 for his alleged role in criticizing Taliban government on social media.

==Political career==
Jalal was elected as a Representative of her Kabul neighborhood to the 2002 Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) of Afghanistan. In 2002, when she ran for the Office of the President in the Interim Government of Afghanistan, she was placed into consideration to lead Afghanistan as Interim President, but she was finally placed a second to ex-president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai. She turned down the offer to become ex-President Hamid Karzai&#x27;s first Vice President in exchange for the withdrawal of her candidacy.

In 2003, Jalal was again elected from Kabul to the Constitutional Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) of Afghanistan. During the drafting of the Constitution of Afghanistan, she worked with fellow women delegates to lobby for the inclusion of women and human rights provisions, including Article 22; Article 53, Section 2; Article 44; Article 54, Section 2; and Articles 83 and 84. During the Constitutional debates on whether Afghan women should be given the right to vote and run as a candidate for high positions in government, her experience in running as a presidential candidate was used as reference by the supporters, citing that she had already practiced that right. By running as presidential candidate, she had already set the benchmark on the highest level of position in which Afghan women should be allowed to compete. This gist of the debate was reflected in the documentation of the Constitutional Commission and was covered by media.   

Dr Massouda Jalal run again for the Office of the President of Afghanistan as the only woman candidate in the 2004 Afghan presidential election. In 2004 election, Jalal was placed 6th among 17 male candidates. From 2001 – 2004. She was the only Afghan woman who was part of the delegation of Afghanistan during the peace negotiations. In this role, she actively participated in formal peace negotiations.

Serving as the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs (2004-2006) in the cabinet of government of Afghanistan and the head of the Commission for the Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW), she left behind a string of legacies that includes the framework for the National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA), a ten-year plan for women to liberate Afghan women from poverty and promote their participation in public life. She was also Head of the Commission for the Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW), which was also adopted later as a decree to liberate Afghan women from fear, violence and oppression. During her time as the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs she travelled to all provinces of Afghanistan. During one of her official trips to the Takhar province of Afghanistan, her convoy was targeted and bombed, leaving two of her guards severely injured. Her efforts to strive to promote human rights, women rights, equality, justice and peace during her work as the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs are published in two books.

Furthermore, &quot;Frontrunner: The Afghan Woman Who Surprised the World&quot; is a documentary made on her. It is the heroic story of the first woman to run for President of Afghanistan. Although she ultimately lost the election to ex-president Hamid Karzai, her courageous campaign opened the door for over 550 women to run for Parliament just a few months later.

==Civil Society Activism ==
Ever since she left working for the government of Afghanistan in 2006, she has been engaged in human rights, civil society, social, and political activism. She is the founder of Jalal Foundation, a non-profit, non-government organization that brings together women&#x27;s councils and organizations to build women&#x27;s capacity, protect women&#x27;s rights, promote women&#x27;s political participation, and bring the voices of women in international fora. Dr. Massouda Jalal has also founded the Freedom Message Weekly Newspaper—an activist tabloid that exposed the abuses of women&#x27;s right and human rights and promoted democracy and freedom of expression in Afghanistan. In these capacities she has traveled to more than 50 countries of the world to represent Afghan women and raise their voices in the international platforms. She is also the founder and co-founder of multiple women&#x27;s organizations and networks in Afghanistan and the region.

In 2010, gunmen attacked two Jalal Foundation women&#x27;s rights activists in Helmand when they were on an official trip, killing one and putting the other in a coma. The attack forced Dr. Jalal to halt her travels. More recently, during her third run for the Office of President in 2019, Dr Jalal boldly critiqued extremism and the violations of human rights and women&#x27;s rights in the national and international media. This resulted in several attacks on her and her family members, including her house and office were bombed by the enemies of peace and democracy. After the fall of Kabul in August 2021, Jalal was forced to go into exile to the Netherlands.

==Awards and honors==

<text>Revolutionary Workers Headquarters (RWH) was a U.S. Marxist-Leninist organization that formed out of a split from the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) in 1977. After Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, died in 1976, the majority of the RCP&#x27;s leadership criticized the post-Mao Chinese leadership as &quot;revisionist&quot; and &quot;capitalist-roaders&quot;, saying that China was no longer a socialist country.

A sizable minority of the RCP (led by Micky Jarvis and Leibel Bergman) believed China was still a socialist country, and continued to support the post-Mao Chinese Communist Party under new leader Hua Guofeng. They left the RCP to form the RWH. Aside from differences on how to assess the changes in China, the RWH also criticized the RCP for ultra-leftism, or left-idealism in their approach to political work in the U.S. After leaving the RCP, the RWH also did an extensive critique of the RCP&#x27;s line on the national question, criticizing the RCP for being &quot;white chauvinist&quot;.

The RWH published this critique in a lengthy pamphlet titled &quot;Build the Black Liberation Movement&quot;, which itself was subsequently criticized by Amiri Baraka of the League of Revolutionary Struggle in a pamphlet titled &quot;RWH on the BLM: Wrong Again!&quot; as having white chauvinist errors. The RWH made efforts to unite in the early 1980s with the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), but then the CP(M-L) dissolved. In 1985, the RWH merged with the Proletarian Unity League and the Organization for Revolutionary Unity to form the Freedom Road Socialist Organization.

During its brief existence, RWH cadre were active in various movements, including the labor movement, struggles of oppressed nationalities, the women&#x27;s movement, the student movement, the struggle for divestiture from companies doing business in then-apartheid dominated South Africa, and others. Through its cadres who worked in the Revolutionary Student Brigade, the RWH was directly involved with the founding of the Progressive Student Network.

Initially, RWH activity was almost exclusively found in urban areas of the Midwest and the East; it expanded to the West Coast when it absorbed the Bay Area Communist Union in 1979.
While the RWH was structured according to the principles of democratic centralism, it did not consider itself a communist party &quot;per se&quot;, but rather a &quot;pre-party organization.&quot;

<text>Mullett Lake is a lake in Cheboygan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The lake is named after John Mullett, who, together with William A. Burt, made a federal survey of the area from 1840 to 1843. A neighboring lake was named after Burt. Historically, Mullett Lake has been recorded as Mullet Lake, Mullet&#x27;s Lake, and Mullett&#x27;s Lake on maps and documents.

==Description of lake==

Major inflows to the lake are the Indian River, which connects with nearby Burt Lake, Pigeon River, Little Pigeon River, and Mullett Creek. The Cheboygan River flows out of the northeast end of the lake.

The lake is part of the Inland Waterway, by which one can boat from Crooked Lake and Round Lake near the Little Traverse Bay on Lake Michigan across the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula to Cheboygan on Lake Huron.

The Inland Waterway was a Native American trade route that was later opened to small steamer and modern recreational traffic.

Interstate 75 passes to the west of the lake, with two interchanges near the south end of the lake at the unincorporated community of Indian River. M-27 passes along the northern shore of the lake through the unincorporated communities of Mullett Lake and Topinabee, while M-33 running north–south passes along a portion of the eastern shore through the community of Aloha.

Mullett Lake is an excellent fishery, containing large populations of game species, including brown trout, brook trout, rainbow trout, lake trout, splake, smelt, northern Pike, muskellunge, yellow perch, walleye, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, sunfish and most notably lake sturgeon (the state record specimen was taken from these waters)

In the census-designated place of Mullett Lake, which is located on the north end of Mullett Lake, there is a historic former Michigan Central passenger train station. The station sits directly at the end of Polish Line Road and has about of lake front property. It was bought in 1950 by an old railroad employee once it shut down and was turned into a family cottage. The &quot;Old Depot&quot;, which is the nickname for the cottage, was the main connection between Detroit and Mackinaw City. The former railbed now serves as the North Central State Trail.

<doc id="1055571" wikidata="Q1362206" url="?curid=1055571" title="Paul Walsh">
<text>Paul Anthony Walsh (born 1 October 1962) is an English former professional footballer who now works as a television pundit.

A pacey and skilful forward, he scored a total of 127 goals in 521 league games in a 17-year career in the English Football League and Premier League; he also won five senior caps for England in an eleven-month international career beginning in June 1983. He began his career at Charlton Athletic, making his first team debut aged 16 in September 1979. He helped Charlton to win promotion out of the Third Division in 1980–81 and then won a place on the PFA Team of the Year in 1981–82. He moved from the Second Division into the First Division when Luton Town paid £400,000 to acquire his services in July 1982. He continued to impress and was named as PFA Young Player of the Year in 1984. He moved to Liverpool for a £700,000 fee in May 1984 and was named in the PFA Team of the Year in his second season for the club as Liverpool won the league title and the Football League Super Cup. He went on to struggle with injury at Anfield, though still managed to appear in losing finals of the 1984 FA Charity Shield, 1984 European Super Cup, 1985 European Cup, and 1987 Football League Cup, as well as help Liverpool to the league title and FA Cup double in 1985–86, and to finish as runners-up in the league in 1984–85 and 1986–87.

He was sold on to Tottenham Hotspur for a £500,000 fee in February 1988 and played for Spurs in their 1991 FA Cup Final victory over Nottingham Forest. However, he was frozen out of the first team after punching a coach (Ray Clemence) at the club, and after a brief loan spell at Queens Park Rangers was moved on to Portsmouth for a £400,000 fee in June 1992. A popular player at Fratton Park, supporters voted him Player of the Season in 1992–93, and he was named on the PFA Team of the Year in 1993–94. He returned to the top flight with Manchester City after signing for £750,000 in March 1994. He returned to Portsmouth for a £600,000 fee in September 1995 but was forced to retire due to cruciate ligament damage in February 1996. After retiring as a player, he became a football pundit and became a regular face on Sky Sports&#x27; &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot;. He was capped five times by England, scoring one goal.

==Club career==
Paul Walsh was born to Don and June Walsh in Plumstead on 1 October 1962; his father was an electrician and his mother worked at Tate &amp; Lyle. He grew up supporting Arsenal. However, his father was a season-ticket holder at West Ham United. Despite his natural skill, his small stature meant he was frequently overlooked in junior football. He was spotted playing for local youth side Londinium by Charlton Athletic scout Jim Fibbins and signed schoolboy forms aged 14. In a 1986 interview with &quot;Shoot&quot; magazine, Walsh cited Londinium manager John O&#x27;Connor as the biggest influence on his career. After leaving school he also began working part-time at a meat factory and later a fruit packing factory before he joined Charlton on a full-time basis.

===Charlton Athletic===
Walsh made his debut for the Reserves in September 1978, playing right midfield against Portsmouth at Fratton Park. He made his first team debut in the English Football League at 16 years old, coming on as a half-time substitute for Dick Tydeman in a Second Division fixture with Shrewsbury Town on 22 September 1979; he provided the assist for Martin Robinson&#x27;s winning goal. Manager Andy Nelson handed him his first professional contract on his 17th birthday, a two-year contract paying £100 a week. However, Nelson was sacked the following March, and the &quot;Addicks&quot; were relegated into the Third Division at the end of the 1979–80 season.

Following the sale of Mike Flanagan to Crystal Palace, new manager Mike Bailey played Walsh in a strike partnership with Derek Hales in the 1980–81 campaign. Due to a League Cup draw, the season opened with three matches against Brentford, and Walsh scored his first senior goal at Griffin Park in a 3–1 defeat before scoring a hat-trick in the return fixture at The Valley, a 5–0 victory; this made him the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the club&#x27;s history. He ended the campaign with 18 goals in all competitions, whilst Hales was named in the division&#x27;s PFA Team of the Year. Charlton were at the top of the table for most of the season, but a loss of form from February cost them the title, though promotion was still secured with a third-place finish.

Bailey left Charlton to replace Alan Mullery as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion manager, and the Charlton board ironically decided to name Mullery as Bailey&#x27;s successor. Charlton finished the 1981–82 season in 13th place, and Walsh scored 15 goals in total. He performed well against divisional champions Luton Town, giving captain Mal Donaghy a difficult afternoon, which was enough to win him a move to his next club.

===Luton Town===
Walsh was signed by Luton Town manager David Pleat for £400,000 plus Steve White in July 1982. Pleat had an attacking philosophy that allowed Walsh to express himself and score goals. In only his second game for Luton at Kenilworth Road, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–3 win over Notts County, the second goal of which was voted Goal of the Season as he beat numerous defenders before chipping the goalkeeper. On the final day of the 1982–83 season Luton needed to beat Manchester City at Maine Road to remain in the First Division, and a late Radomir Antić volley secured the &quot;Hatters&quot; a 1–0 win and a place in the top-flight. After the game, Pleat celebrated by running down the touchline in a scene that became an iconic moment of 1980s football in England.

Luton enjoyed an excellent start to the 1983–84 season and were in third place on Boxing Day. On 10 December, Walsh scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 win over Stoke City at the Victoria Ground. However, a run of just three wins in 24 games saw Luton go from title contenders to relegation candidates, as well as exit the FA Cup in a 4–3 defeat to rivals Watford at Vicarage Road. Luton ended the campaign in 16th place, and Walsh was voted as PFA Young Player of the Year, ahead of candidates such as Ian Rush, Nigel Callaghan and John Barnes.

===Liverpool===
Liverpool manager Joe Fagan bought Walsh for a £700,000 fee in May 1984. Walsh turned down an approach from Italian Serie A side Como to join Liverpool. He joined Liverpool in time to travel with the players to Rome to see them win the 1984 European Cup Final. He made his debut as a substitute on 18 August 1984 in the 1–0 Charity Shield defeat to derby rivals Everton. With Ian Rush injured at the start of the 1984–85 season, Walsh partnered Kenny Dalglish up front, and he scored just 14 seconds into his Anfield debut on 27 August in a 3–0 win over West Ham United. However, he picked up a knee injury in October which caused him to miss six weeks and allowed Rush to re-establish himself as Dalglish&#x27;s preferred strike partner. He scored 13 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions throughout the 1984–85 campaign, the most significant goal being the equaliser in the last minute of extra-time against rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals at Goodison Park. However, Liverpool would lose the replay and also finished as runners-up in the league and European Cup. Walsh started the 1985 European Cup Final against Juventus at Heysel Stadium but had to come off early in the second half after aggravating a stomach injury; Liverpool lost the game 1–0, though the day would be remembered for the disaster which cost 39 lives.

Fagan&#x27;s retirement in May 1985 and Dalglish&#x27;s subsequent promotion to player-manager meant that instead of gradually succeeding Dalglish as Liverpool&#x27;s main striker, Walsh had to contend with a rival for his position as the club&#x27;s manager. He missed 1985–86 pre-season after undergoing a hernia operation. He returned to fitness against Oxford United on 14 September. He had a bitter argument with Dalglish at half-time, which initially seemed to spell the end of his Liverpool career as he was placed on the transfer list. He returned to the first team, though, and was taken off the transfer list by his own request and soon entered a scoring streak. However, his form was ended after he ruptured his ankle ligaments in a collision with Manchester United&#x27;s Kevin Moran on 9 February. He returned to action six weeks later. Still, he continued to suffer from ankle trouble and was ruled out for the rest of the season, ending the campaign with 18 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions throughout the campaign. His injury caused him to miss the 1986 FA Cup Final, though he had played enough league games to secure a First Division winners medal as Liverpool won the league by a two-point margin over Everton. His contribution to the club&#x27;s success was not forgotten as he was named in the First Division&#x27;s PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Mark Lawrenson.

Writing in his 2015 autobiography, Walsh was highly critical of Liverpool&#x27;s Boot Room culture, particularly then-medical staff Ronnie Moran and Roy Evans:

He again missed pre-season in the summer of 1986, as he underwent an operation to correct his ankle injury. He recovered to earn a place on the bench for the second leg of the Football League Super Cup final victory over Everton on 30 September, but though he only entered the game as a late substitute he broke his hand after falling awkwardly. The day after the match, he had to drive himself to the hospital for an x-ray and to receive treatment. Having recovered from this injury, he went on to score a hat-trick in a 6–2 home win over Norwich City. He then went 12 games without a goal, and John Aldridge was signed to add competition to the forward roles. Walsh started at Wembley in the 2–1 League Cup final defeat to Arsenal, before being taken off for Dalglish after 73 minutes. Liverpool finished second in the league, nine points behind Everton, and Walsh scored only six goals in 32 appearances throughout the campaign.

The arrival of new forwards of Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge and John Barnes left Walsh only making occasional appearances in the 1987–88 campaign. He played just nine games without scoring a goal, though maintained fitness by playing games for the reserves. He began drinking heavily, later admitting &quot;the only thing I was interested in by that point was getting pissed and enjoying myself&quot;.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Walsh was signed by Tottenham Hotspur for £500,000 in February 1988, just after the appointment of Terry Venables as manager. He continued to drink heavily and admitted to being a &quot;ring leader&quot; of a drinking culture alongside Neil Ruddock, Terry Fenwick and David Howells which was to the detriment of the club&#x27;s on-field progress. He ended the 1987–88 season with one goal in 11 games for Spurs. He later said he was &quot;running at 70% capacity&quot;.

Walsh was partnered with new-signing Paul Stewart for the 1988–89 season, whilst fellow new arrival Paul Gascoigne boosted both the club&#x27;s attacking potential and drinking culture. Spurs had a poor start to the season and were in a relegation battle during the first half of the season, and only Gascoigne and Chris Waddle were creating and scoring goals. Walsh felt that manager Terry Venables was too easy on the players and particularly too easy on Walsh himself who &quot;needed someone on my case a bit more&quot;. He later described the season as &quot;just a blur&quot; as Spurs turned their campaign around to finish in sixth place despite Walsh scoring just six goals from 32 starts and five substitute appearances.

Venables brought Gary Lineker back from Barcelona, and Stewart was selected to be Lineker&#x27;s striker partner for the 1989–90 season, leaving Walsh on the bench. An injury to Stewart gave Walsh a chance to win back his first-team place, and he marked his return to the first team with the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over rivals Arsenal, though failed to capitalise on this performance and again was dropped. Later in the season, he had to be taken off at half-time against Wimbledon as he had a long night of drinking with George Best the previous night. Spurs finished third in the league that season. He ended the campaign with three goals from 13 starts and 18 substitute appearances.

He was on the bench for the first nine games of the 1990–91 campaign, but in his first start scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Sheffield United. However, Venables dropped him to the bench for the following game, and Walsh became &quot;cynical and pissed off&quot; as he felt nothing he could do could displace either Stewart and Lineker, though he ended the season with 20 starts and 19 substitute appearances. He did though make an appearance at Wembley in the 1991 FA Cup Final, coming on for Vinny Samways 82 minutes into a 2–1 victory over Nottingham Forest.

Walsh missed two weeks of the 1991–92 pre-season with a groin injury, and on his first game back for the reserves at White Hart Lane punched reserve team manager Ray Clemence in the face after Clemence substituted him off after an hour. Walsh was suspended for two weeks and upon his return was loaned out to Queens Park Rangers for a month. QPR manager Gerry Francis wanted to make the signing a permanent one, but the club were unable to afford the £800,000 fee Spurs had asked for. After returning to Spurs, he again punched someone in the face, this time a supporter who had shouted abuse to Walsh on the pitch after a game against Norwich City. He ended the campaign with three goals in 22 starts and 15 substitute appearances.

===Portsmouth===
Walsh was signed by Portsmouth for a £400,000 fee in June 1992, as manager Jim Smith prepared for a promotion challenge from the new Division One in the 1992–93 season. To tempt him out of the top-flight, &quot;Pompey&quot; manager Jim Smith offered him a four-year contract on a higher wage than he had been on at Spurs, whilst the club also bought his London home off him to facilitate his move to the south coast. In his autobiography, he admitted that he was not keen on joining Portsmouth but stated that he decided to take a much more professional approach to his career in terms of training and eating healthier food to start the 1992–93 pre-season in good physical condition; he credited his new approach to the birth of his first child. Ironically though, a virus picked up on a family holiday to Saint Lucia caused him to miss a month early in the season and drained him of fitness. He recovered to build a strike partnership with Guy Whittingham, whilst midfielders Alan McLoughlin and Mark Chamberlain made an effective four-pronged attack, and with two games to go Portsmouth were top of the table and needed only to beat relegation-threatened Sunderland to secure an automatic promotion place. However, they lost the match 4–1, and Walsh was sent off; he wrecked the Roker Park dressing rooms in a fit of temper. Portsmouth missed out on automatic promotion on goal difference, Walsh was suspended for the play-off games, and Portsmouth lost at the semi-final stage to Leicester City. Despite Whittingham scoring 47 league goals in all competitions, it was Walsh who the fans voted as their Player of the Year.

With Whittingham sold, Walsh failed to build an effective partnership with new signing Gerry Creaney, and Portsmouth failed to put together a promotion push for the 1993–94 season. However, Walsh scored both goals in a 2–2 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford in the League Cup, putting himself back on the radar for top-flight clubs in need of strikers.

===Manchester City===
Manchester City manager Brian Horton, his former captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh&#x27;s services in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left to play and had also signed another new striker, Uwe Rosler – a German player who had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding, however, and the arrival of wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to steer clear of the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.

Horton tried to accommodate Niall Quinn, returning from a long-term injury, alongside Rösler and Walsh in the first team for the 1994–95 season, and as a result, had a very strong attacking team. City were in sixth place and pushing for European qualification for the first time since the 1970s by December, but then ten games without a win and three months without a goal for Walsh saw City fall down the table. They ended the campaign in 17th place and Horton was sacked. New manager Alan Ball tried to build a team around new signing Georgi Kinkladze for the 1995–96 campaign, and Walsh felt that the time had come to leave Maine Road.

===Return to Portsmouth===
Former Spurs teammate Terry Fenwick, now manager at Portsmouth, took Walsh back to Fratton Park in exchange for Gerry Creaney (valued at £600,000) in September 1995; Walsh signed a three-year contract with the club. He scored five goals in 21 league games in the 1995–96 season before suffering a micro-fracture of the fibula in a seemingly innocuous incident during a 1–1 draw with Millwall at The Den on 27 January. He played against Leicester City on 10 February, but his knee collapsed. The resulting cruciate ligament damage meant that he never played professional football again, although he did not announce his retirement until the following year. He became assistant first-team coach at the club upon his retirement. He had a testimonial game at Fratton Park in May 1998. He was a popular figure at the club, and in February 2005 he came second in the &quot;Football Focus&quot; poll to find the club&#x27;s &quot;cult hero&quot;, behind teammate Alan Knight.

==International career==
Walsh was selected for the England youth team&#x27;s summer trip to the Adria Cup at Yugoslavia in 1979. He was selected for the 1980 UEFA European Under-18 Championship in East Germany, which England won, though he made only two substitute appearances during the tournament. Soon after signing for Luton Town in 1982, he became a regular in the England under-21 side during the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He played both legs against Greece, and scored the winning goal against Hungary to take England into the knock-out stages.

Walsh won his first senior England cap under Bobby Robson on 12 June 1983, in a 0–0 friendly draw with Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground during a two-week tour of the continent. Three days later he scored the only goal of the game against Australia in the second match of the tour at Brisbane&#x27;s Lang Park. He then went on to secure his third cap within the space of seven days in a 1–1 draw with Australia at the Olympic Park Stadium. He earned a fourth cap playing alongside club-mate Brian Stein in a 2–0 defeat to France at Parc des Princes on 29 February 1984. The last of his five senior appearances for England came on 2 May 1984 in a 1–0 British Home Championship defeat to Wales at Wrexham&#x27;s Racecourse Ground.

==Style of play==
In 1986, Bob Paisley described Walsh as an &quot;individualist&quot; best suited for a lone striker role due to his selfish play, tremendous pace and dribbling ability. He was able to shoot powerfully with both feet. He had an aggressive temperament, which led to occasional bookings and red cards for ill-discipline.

==Post-retirement==
Walsh became a football agent for a short time and represented Lee Bradbury during his move to Manchester City. He also invested in property and other businesses, though he lost money by investing in Australian fraudster Peter Foster. Walsh began working in the media after retiring as a player and first began working as a pundit on Sky Sports in 2001, and since that time has appeared regularly on &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; and &quot;Football First&quot;. In December 2007, he led a campaign against speeding fines in Hampshire.

==Personal life==
He married Bev in 1990, and the couple had their first child, Jordan, on 12 January 1991. They had another son, Mason, on 22 November 1995, who turned professional at AFC Bournemouth in April 2014. Walsh published his autobiography, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Good&quot;, in 2015. His son, Mason, played for Bognor Regis Town.

<doc id="1055577" wikidata="Q1639736" url="?curid=1055577" title="Black Hole Sun">
<text>&quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; is a song by American rock band Soundgarden. Written by frontman Chris Cornell, the song was released in May 1994 by A&amp;M Records as the third single from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Superunknown&quot; (1994). Considered to be the band&#x27;s signature song, it topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart, where it spent a total of seven weeks at number one. Despite peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; finished as the number-one track of 1994 for that listing. Worldwide, the single reached the top 10 in Australia, Canada, France, and Ireland, while in Iceland, it reached number one. The accompanying music video was directed by Howard Greenhalgh.

&quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was included on Soundgarden&#x27;s 1997 greatest hits album &quot;A-Sides&quot;; it also appeared on the 2010 compilation album &quot;Telephantasm&quot;. In 2021, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song number 368 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Origin and recording==
&quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was written by frontman Chris Cornell. In 2014, Cornell explained the song&#x27;s origins to Uncut Magazine:

Cornell said that he wrote the song in about 15 minutes. He used a Gretsch guitar to write the song, and commented, &quot;I wrote the song thinking the band wouldn&#x27;t like it—then it became the biggest hit of the summer.&quot; Cornell came up with the song while using a Leslie speaker. Guitarist Kim Thayil said that the Leslie model 16 speaker was perfect for the song as &quot;it&#x27;s very Beatlesque and has a distinctive sound. It ended up changing the song completely.&quot; Thayil said that the song &quot;wasn&#x27;t safe as milk, but it wasn&#x27;t glass in someone&#x27;s eye either. It was the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down. Now it&#x27;s the &#x27;Dream On&#x27; of our set.&quot; The song was performed in a slightly sharp drop D tuning, similar to the tuning used on the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hunted Down&quot;. Drummer Matt Cameron called the song &quot;a huge departure&quot;. Credit is due to Michael Beinhorn and Brendan O&#x27;Brien, producer and recording engineer, respectively.

Appearing on The Pods &amp; Sods Network in July 2017, Beinhorn detailed the process of recording &quot;Superunknown&quot; and shared his reaction to first hearing &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;: &quot;I think for the rest of my entire life, until I draw my last breath, I&#x27;ll never ever forgot how I felt when they started playing that song. From the very first few notes, I felt like I&#x27;d been hit by a thunderbolt. I was just absolutely stunned. What in the world is this? I get goosebumps thinking about it now.&quot;

==Composition==

Musically, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; has been described as grunge, psychedelic rock, alternative rock, hard rock, and stoner rock. Regarding the song&#x27;s lyrics, Cornell stated, &quot;It&#x27;s just sort of a surreal dreamscape, a weird, play-with-the-title kind of song.&quot; He also said that &quot;lyrically it&#x27;s probably the closest to me just playing with words for words&#x27; sake, of anything I&#x27;ve written. I guess it worked for a lot of people who heard it, but I have no idea how you&#x27;d begin to take that one literally.&quot; In another interview he elaborated further, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s funny because hits are usually sort of congruent, sort of an identifiable lyric idea, and that song pretty much had none. The chorus lyric is kind of beautiful and easy to remember. Other than that, I sure didn&#x27;t have an understanding of it after I wrote it. I was just sucked in by the music and I was painting a picture with the lyrics. There was no real idea to get across.&quot; Commenting upon how the song was misinterpreted as being positive, Cornell said, &quot;No one seems to get this, but &#x27;Black Hole Sun&#x27; is sad. But because the melody is really pretty, everyone thinks it&#x27;s almost chipper, which is ridiculous.&quot; When asked about the line, &quot;Times are gone for honest men&quot;, Cornell said:

It&#x27;s really difficult for a person to create their own life and their own freedom. It&#x27;s going to become more and more difficult, and it&#x27;s going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to get what they want. There&#x27;s so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We&#x27;ve been so lucky that we&#x27;ve never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.

==Reception==
===Commercial performance===
&quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was released as a single in mid-1994. It became the most successful song from &quot;Superunknown&quot; on American rock charts, and became the band&#x27;s best-known song overall. It appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 Airplay chart, reaching the top 30. The following week it debuted on the Top 40 Mainstream, where it peaked at number nine in its eighth week and remained on the chart until its 20th week. The song peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song spent a total of seven weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; received the award for Best Hard Rock Performance and received a nomination for Best Rock Song.

Outside the United States, the single was released in Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In Canada, the song reached the top 10 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart. It remained in the top 10 for three weeks and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting song in Canada. &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; reached the UK top 20 and was the last single from the album that charted in the UK top 20; it remains the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the UK. &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; debuted at number 10 in Australia but quickly descended the chart; however, widespread airplay and a promotional visit to Australia stimulated a resurgence of interest in &quot;Superunknown&quot;. &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; would peak at number six on the Australian Singles Chart. &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; reached the top 30 in Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, and was a top-10 success in France and Ireland. It topped the Icelandic Singles Chart for a week and was a moderate top-20 success in Sweden. The single has sold over three million copies worldwide.

===Critical reception===
Greg Prato of AllMusic called the song &quot;one of the few bright spots&quot; of mid-1994, when &quot;the world was still reeling from Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide the previous April&quot;. He said, &quot;The song had a psychedelic edge to it (especially evident in the verse&#x27;s guitar part), as the composition shifted between sedate melodicism and gargantuan guitar riffs. The lyrics were classic Chris Cornell—lines didn&#x27;t exactly make sense on paper but did within the song.&quot; Ann Powers of &quot;Blender&quot; proclaimed that &quot;Cornell&#x27;s fixation with the Beatles pays off with the hit single &#x27;Black Hole Sun&#x27; &quot;. In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton wrote, &quot;Easily the most commercial single the US band have released to date&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; techniques—fuzz-toned low chords, legato lead-guitar hooks and lumpy Ringo Starr-style drumming...are linked to Lennon-style melody in &#x27;Black Hole Sun&#x27;.&quot; Roger Morton from &quot;NME&quot; named it &quot;the best moment&quot; from their album, &quot;a melodramatic downer ballad, whose bleakness is offsett by some curious psychedelic guitar figures.&quot; J.D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated, &quot;With its yearning, Lennonesque melody and watery, Harrison-style guitar, &#x27;Black Hole Sun&#x27; is a wonderful exercise in Beatleisms; trouble is, it&#x27;s not a very good song, offering more in the way of mood and atmosphere than melodic direction.&quot; Roy Wilkinson from &quot;Select&quot; noted &quot;the descending corkscrew melody&quot; of the song.

The solo for &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, performed by Thayil, was ranked number 63 on &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot;, and number 56 on &quot;Total Guitar&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Hottest Guitar Solos&quot;. The song was included on VH1&#x27;s countdown of the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;90s&quot; at number 25. It was also included on VH1&#x27;s countdown of the &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs&quot; at number 77. According to Nielsen Music&#x27;s year-end report for 2019, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was the ninth most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 125,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song number four on their list of the 15 greatest Soundgarden songs, and in 2021, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number one on their list of the 20 greatest Soundgarden songs.

==Music video==
The surreal and apocalyptic music video for &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was directed by British video director Howard Greenhalgh, produced by Megan Hollister for Why Not Films (London, England), shot by Ivan Bartos, and features post-production work by 525 Post Production (Hollywood, California) and Soho 601 Effects (London). The video follows a suburban neighborhood and its vain inhabitants with grotesquely exaggerated grins, which are eventually swallowed up when the Sun suddenly turns into a black hole, while the band performs the song somewhere in an open field. In the video, Cornell is wearing a fork necklace given to him by Shannon Hoon of Blind Melon. In an online chat, the band stated that the video &quot;was entirely the director&#x27;s idea&quot;, and added, &quot;Our take on it was that at that point in making videos, we just wanted to pretend to play and not look that excited about it.&quot; They said that the video was one of the few Soundgarden videos the band was satisfied with.

The video was released in June 1994. After several weeks of airplay on MTV, a second version of the video was substituted containing more elaborate visual effects than the original, including the addition of a computer-generated black hole. The music video for &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; became a hit on MTV and received the award for Best Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1995, it received the Clio Award for Alternative Music Video. The video is available on the CD-ROM &quot;Alive in the Superunknown&quot;.

<text>Dance Band on the Titanic is the seventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1977. Its vinyl release is a double album. It was later released as a single CD.

==Reception==
Reviewed at the time of release, &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr Chapin is such a master at his particular craft that his music itself is totally middle class, boring and as bland as the outward appearances and the public lifestyles of the men and women in his songs. So what is Chapin trying to do? Express suburban, boredom and frustration in realistic photographic detail? He does that alright.&quot;
The album sold poorly, but was voted Album of the Year by &quot;The Times&quot; of London

<doc id="1055590" wikidata="Q48786" url="?curid=1055590" title="Sakharov Prize">
<text>The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, commonly known as the Sakharov Prize, is an honorary award for individuals or groups who have dedicated their lives to the defence of human rights and freedom of thought. Named after Russian scientist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, the prize was established in December 1988 by the European Parliament.

A shortlist of nominees is drawn up annually by the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Development. The MEPs who make up those committees then select a shortlist in September. Thereafter, the final choice is given to The European Parliament&#x27;s Conference of Presidents (President and political group&#x27;s leaders) and the laureate&#x27;s name is announced late in October. The prize is awarded in a ceremony at the Parliament&#x27;s Strasbourg hemicycle (round chamber) in December. The prize includes a monetary award of €50,000.

The first prize was awarded jointly to South African Nelson Mandela and Russian Anatoly Marchenko. The 1990 award was given to Aung San Suu Kyi, but she could not receive it until 2013 as a result of her political imprisonment in Burma. The prize has also been awarded to organisations, the first being the Argentine Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1992. Six Sakharov laureates were subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize: Aung San Suu Kyi (1991), Nelson Mandela (1993), Malala Yousafzai (2014), Denis Mukwege (2018), Nadia Murad (2018) and Memorial (2022).

Razan Zaitouneh (2011) was kidnapped in 2013 and is still missing. Nasrin Sotoudeh (2012) was released from prison in September 2013, but is still barred from leaving Iran, along with fellow 2012 laureate Jafar Panahi. The 2017 prize was awarded to the Democratic Opposition in Venezuela, under boycott of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left.

As of 2024, the prize has been awarded to 51 recipients: 39 individuals (with 3 posthumously given) and 12 organizations.

<text>Amos Lawrence (April 22, 1786 – December 31, 1852) was an American merchant and philanthropist.

==Biography==
Amos Lawrence was born in Groton, Massachusetts. Lawrence attended elementary school in Groton and briefly attended the Groton Academy. In 1799, at age 13, Amos Lawrence became a clerk at a country store in Dunstable, Massachusetts, and a few months afterward was promoted to a variety store in Groton. After the completion of his apprenticeship, in April 1807, Amos went to Boston with $20 of his savings. His employers&#x27; business there failed. Amos was appointed by the creditors to settle the firm&#x27;s accounts, and after doing that to their satisfaction he rented a shop on Cornhill and founded a dry-goods establishment on his own account in December. In 1808, his brother Abbott entered his employ as chief clerk, and in 1814 became a partner in the firm, now called A. &amp; A. Lawrence and later A. &amp; A. Lawrence and Co. The firm continued until Amos&#x27;s death and became the greatest wholesale mercantile house in the United States. It was successful even in the hard times of 1812 to 1815, and afterwards engaged particularly in selling woolen and cotton goods on commission. In 1818, A. &amp; A. Lawrence purchased 50 shares of the Suffolk Bank, a clearinghouse bank on State Street in Boston.

The firm did much for the establishment of the cotton textile industry in New England. In 1830, it came to the aid of financially distressed mills of Lowell, Massachusetts. In that year, the Suffolk, Tremont and Lawrence companies were established in Lowell, and Luther Lawrence, the eldest brother, represented the firm&#x27;s interests there. In 1845–1847, the firm established and built up Lawrence, Massachusetts, named in honor of Abbott Lawrence, who was a director of the Essex Company, which controlled the water power of Lawrence, and afterwards was president of the Atlantic Cotton Mills and Pacific Mills there.

In 1831 when his health failed, Amos Lawrence retired from active involvement in the firm, where thereafter Abbott Lawrence was the head. The later years of Amos&#x27;s life were spent mostly in furthering various philanthropic enterprises. According to his records, from 1829 until his death, Amos Lawrence gave over $639,000 (in 1840s dollars) to charitable causes. In 1842, he decided not to allow his property to increase any further, and in the last eleven years of his life he spent in charity at least $525,000. To Williams College, he gave nearly $40,000; to Groton Academy, which later changed its name to Lawrence Academy to honor both Amos and his brother, William, he gave over $20,000; to Wabash College, Kenyon College, and the theological seminary at Bangor, Maine, he also gave sizable sums.

His private donations were numerous, requiring several rooms in his house to coordinate them. Among other things, Amos Lawrence donated libraries to academic institutions, established a children&#x27;s hospital in Boston, and gave $10,000 for the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument (Lawrence&#x27;s father had fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill). He gave to many good causes on a smaller scale, taking especial delight in occasionally giving books from a bundle in his sleigh or carriage as he drove.

Upon his death in Boston in 1852, his fortune was estimated at $14,100,000, roughly $600,000,000 in today&#x27;s dollars.

==Family==
Lawrence was the fourth son of Samuel Lawrence and Susanna (née Parker) Lawrence. Samuel Lawrence was a Revolutionary War officer and one of the founders of Groton Academy (now Lawrence Academy at Groton), where Amos was educated. Samuel was in turn descended from John Lawrence of Wissett in Suffolk, England, who was one of the first settlers of Groton. Among Amos Lawrence&#x27;s brothers were Luther Lawrence and Abbott Lawrence. The family firm, with Abbott Lawrence at its head, founded Lawrence, Massachusetts.

On June 6, 1811, Lawrence married Sarah Richards. They had three children, including Amos A. Lawrence. After Richards died in 1819, Amos Lawrence married Nancy Means Ellis, widow of former U.S. Representative for New Hampshire and New Hampshire Superior Court justice Caleb Ellis, on April 11, 1821. Lawrence had two more children from his second marriage.

Amos A. Lawrence was the founder of Lawrence, Kansas (thus its name) through his work with the New England Emigrant Aid Company, founded the University of Kansas, and also helped found Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. His son, Bishop William Lawrence, was the longtime Episcopal bishop of Massachusetts.

Jane Pierce, who served as First Lady during the presidency of her husband, Franklin Pierce, from 1853 to 1857, was Lawrence’s niece.

<text>Gun Fight, known as in Japan and Europe, is a 1975 multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, and released by Taito in Japan and Europe and by Midway in North America. Based around two Old West cowboys armed with revolvers and squaring off in a duel, it was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat. The Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor instead of TTL. The game&#x27;s concept was adapted from Sega&#x27;s 1969 arcade electro-mechanical game &quot;Gun Fight&quot;.

The game was a global commercial success. In Japan, &quot;Western Gun&quot; was among the top ten highest-grossing arcade video games of 1976. In the United States, &quot;Gun Fight&quot; sold 8,600 arcade cabinets and was the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1975, second highest-grossing arcade game of 1976 and fifth highest arcade game of 1977.

It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built-in game in 1977 and later the Atari 8-bit computers.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Western Gun&quot; is a single-screen shooter where two players compete in an Old West gun fight. It was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat. When shot, the characters fall to the ground and the words &quot;GOT ME!&quot; appear above the body. The game has two joysticks per player: an eight-way joystick for moving the computerized cowboy and the other for changing the shooting direction. Unlike later dual stick games, &quot;Western Gun&quot; has the movement joystick on the right.

Obstacles between the characters block shots, such as a cactus, and (in later levels) stagecoaches. The guns have limited ammunition, with each player given six bullets. A round ends if both players run out of ammo. Gunshots can ricochet off the top and bottom edges of the playfield, allowing for indirect hits.

Taito&#x27;s original &quot;Western Gun&quot; allows the two players to move around anywhere on the screen. Midway&#x27;s version, &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, restricts each player to their respective portions of the screen and also increased the size of the characters.

==Development==

=== Western Gun ===
&quot;Western Gun&quot; was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado for Taito Corporation. He based the gameplay off of the electro-mechanical game &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1969) released by Sega. &quot;Gun Fight&quot; featured two cowboys on a movable track behind rock walls were separated by a field of objects like cacti, trees, and a saloon. If the players shot the cacti, the top would temporarily fall over, as would the cowboy if struck. Points were accumulated by shooting an opponent as many times as possible within the allotted timeframe. Nishikado adapted the mechanics of the original game and added rocks that bullets could ricochet off. Cacti in the environment would be partially destroyed when shot.

Having previously explored creating representational humanoids with the game &quot;TV Basketball&quot; (1974), Nishikado pushed the bar further by creating two articulated characters who could wander the screen as well as move their arms to aim the gun. The game was developed using transistor–transistor logic (TTL), as game development had not yet moved to microprocessors. The game was among the most complex TTL games developed in the 1970s.

The game features two sets of controls – one joystick to move the character and fire the weapon and another for aiming the arm. The secondary joystick only allows for vertical movement, with direction being dependent on the movement of the character. &quot;Western Gun&quot; could be considered the first twin-stick shooter.

=== Gun Fight ===
Taito had previously made licensing deals with Midway Manufacturing to release their video games in the United States, including &quot;TV Basketball&quot; and &quot;Speed Race&quot; (1974) (renamed &quot;Wheels&quot; by Midway). Once &quot;Western Gun&quot; was in development, the game was shown to representatives of Midway. The executives were not impressed with the game&#x27;s graphics, which they considered unappealing for North American audiences.

Dave Nutting Associates (DNA) was a coin-operated game development firm operated by Dave Nutting and Jeffery Fredriksen. Previously, DNA had tried to interest Midway&#x27;s parent company Bally Manufacturing in a microprocessor-based pinball game. Though Bally did not accept this deal, DNA maintained a close relationship. Using the Intel 8080 microprocessor, Fredriksen developed hardware to power arcade video games. He pioneered the use of a cost-effective framebuffer, which enabled versatility to create any type of game they desired. The hardware included a special barrel shifter circuit built from discrete chips. The microprocessor used this to shift each pattern of picture bits to the proper horizontal bit offset, reading back each shifted byte and then writing it into the framebuffer. The 8080, like other microprocessors of its era, had shift instructions that could only shift by a single bit position. With the shifter circuit, the microprocessor could quickly shift a picture byte by several bit positions, giving it more time for other work. 

Nutting and Fredriksen developed a basic demonstration of a baseball game and showcased it to Midway, who had created many pitch-and-bat electro-mechanical baseball games. Midway instead proposed that DNA should adapt &quot;Western Gun&quot; to their arcade hardware. To program this translation, Fredriksen recruited from his alma mater the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The head of the Robotic and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Richard Northouse, agreed to have two of his students sent to DNA as a work-study. Thomas A. McHugh (1946-2020) and another programmer (later replaced by Jamie Fenton) were propositioned to work on &quot;Gun Fight&quot;. McHugh took the offer and served as the principle programmer under game designer David Nutting. The game was programmed in assembly language using an Intellec 8 microprocessor development system, with graphical elements translated from hexadecimal code.

DNA&#x27;s version increased the size of the player characters, while at the same time restricting each character&#x27;s movement on their respective halves of the screen. It also added limited shots, indicated by a set of bullets drawn graphically at the bottom of the screen. The game&#x27;s cabinet featured a bezel which provided indications of score, game time, and bullets. The screen also featured an overlay which rendered the white graphical elements of the screen yellow. Controls were altered slightly from &quot;Western Gun&quot;, with a larger aiming stick featuring a wider range of movement rather than purely vertical.

Their version of the game eliminated the rock obstacles, added indestructible trees, and created a progression of stages after each round. More obstacles were added to the field as the scores got higher, introducing a moving stagecoach to serve as an additional impediment.

Midway&#x27;s version was released as &quot;Gun Fight&quot; in November 1975.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Western Gun&quot; was among the top ten highest-rated arcade video games of 1976 by operators polled in the 1976 New Year&#x27;s Holiday period.

&quot;Gun Fight&quot; sold 8,600 units in the United States, making it among the best selling video games of the time period and the top selling game released in 1975.

In March 1976, the first annual &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade chart listed &quot;Gun Fight&quot; as third best-charting video game among its polled operators. In October the same year, &quot;RePlay&quot; listed &quot;Gun Fight&quot; in second place, below Midway&#x27;s &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;. In November 1977, the first annual &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade chart listed &quot;Gun Fight&quot; as the fifth best-charting arcade video game of 1977. &quot;Play Meter&quot; later listed it among the top 30 top arcade games of 1978 among operators polled.

Tomohiro Nishikado believed that his original version was more fun than Midway&#x27;s version, but he was impressed with the Midway machine&#x27;s improved graphics and smoother animation. He was inspired to explore microprocessor-based hardware, which eventually resulted in &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978). The hardware of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; is incredibly similar to &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, including the use of the barrel shifter circuit. The hardware was also reused in subsequent Dave Nutting Associates-developed Midway games including &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; (1976) and &quot;280 ZZZAP&quot; (1976). In Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders Part II&quot; of 1979, this circuit was replaced by a Fujitsu MB14241, a single-chip implementation of the barrel shifter introduced in &quot;Gun Fight&quot;.

In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed it as the eleventh greatest video game of the 1970s.

==Ports==
When Dave Nutting Associates developed the Bally Professional Arcade console, they included a built-in version of Gun Fight in the system&#x27;s ROM. This version was programmed by Alan McNeil, later of &quot;Berzerk&quot; fame.

In 1984, Epyx released &quot;Gun Fight&quot; bundled with another Midway game, &quot;Sea Wolf II&quot;, for Atari 8-bit computers as part of their &quot;Arcade Classics&quot; compilation.

==Legacy==
Gun Fight was popular enough to spawn a sequel released in 1977, &quot;Boot Hill&quot;.

The game was included in GameSpy&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; in 2002. They commented that &quot;&quot;Gun Fight&quot; was the first game to feature two humanized characters attempting to outfight each other, which would become one of the most common themes in games for the next 25-plus years&quot;; that it was one of the first Japanese video games imported to North America; and that Midway&#x27;s version &quot;was the first microprocessor-based arcade game&quot;.

&quot;Outlaw&quot; released for the Atari Video Computer System was a clone of &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, rather than the arcade game it was named after which was a light gun shooting game.

In 1982, the clone &quot;Gunfight&quot; was released for the Atari 8-bit computers by Hofacker / Elcomp Publishing. &quot;The Duel&quot; for the Commodore 64 is a clone released in 1985.

Taito used a control scheme similar to &quot;Western Gun&quot; for the run and gun video game &quot;Front Line&quot; (1982). In 1995, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; host Dominik Diamond called Sega&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Virtual On: Cyber Troopers&quot; &quot;a futuristic version&quot; of &quot;Gun Fight&quot;.

<text>ZF Sachs AG, also known as Fichtel &amp; Sachs, was founded in Schweinfurt in 1895 and was a well-known German family business. At its last point as an independent company, the company name was Fichtel &amp; Sachs AG.

In 1997, the automotive supplier was taken over by Mannesmann and renamed Mannesmann Sachs AG. As of 2001, Sachs belonged to ZF Friedrichshafen as a subsidiary company ZF Sachs AG. In 2011, ZF Sachs, like other Group subsidiaries, was legally merged with ZF Friedrichshafen AG and the independent business units integrated into the ZF divisions. Sachs has since become a brand of ZF Friedrichshafen AG. The head office for development, production and sales of products of the brand Sachs remained in Schweinfurt. The Schweinfurt plant is today (2017) the largest location of the automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen.

Today, Fichtel &amp; Sachs is a German manufacturer of automotive parts, producing powertrain and suspension components. In the past the company also having produced ball bearings, motorcycle engines, bicycle parts and – via its subsidiary Sachs Motorcycles – motorcycles, mopeds, motorised bicycles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs).

== History ==
=== Ernst Sachs era ===

==== Early beginnings ====
In 1894, Ernst Sachs made his first design attempts for bicycle hubs, with the first patent on November 23 on bicycle ball bearings with sliding ball tread. On August 1, 1895, Ernst Sachs (technical director) and Karl Fichtel (commercial management) founded Schweinfurt Precision Ball Bearing factories (Fichtel &amp; Sachs as oHG) with a founding capital sum of 15,000 Deutsche marks. First ball bearings and bicycle hubs were made. In 1896, Schweinfurt Precision Ball Bearing factories already employed 70 workers, who produced about 50 to 70 hubs daily.

==== World-famous inventions ====

* 1889: Bicycle freewheel by Ernst Sachs.
* 1903: Backpedal brake by Ernst Sachs.
* 1903: Torpedo freewheel hub: bicycle component with integrated freewheel and coaster brake, by Ernst Sachs.

The bicycle gear was not invented by Fichtel &amp; Sachs, but developed over decades. This developed the conventional, modern bike, with its basic components from Fichtel &amp; Sachs.

===== Birth of globalisation =====

After the invention of the torpedo freewheel hub in 1903, Ernst Sachs was the first to have the idea to not patent the whole product, but worldwide to patent only one component, without which no one could build a modern bike. This led to product piracy in China at the time, with confoundingly similar falsifications of the torpedo freewheel hub. After the invention of the well-known torpedo freewheel hub, which preceded eight years of construction work and was already so mature that it has barely changed over many decades, the company grew rapidly. By 1905, they were employing 1,800 employees and had a production of 382,000 torpedo hubs.

==== Rapid growth ====
Sachs&#x27;s father-in-law, Wilhelm Höpflinger, received a patent for the first usable ball cage still used today in the ball bearing industry. Fichtel &amp; Sachs was one of the world&#x27;s leading companies for rolling bearings, where Sachs registered more than 100 patents, and bicycle hubs before the First World War. A further development boost brought the conversion of multiple of the factories to armaments during the war, when the number of employees rose from 5000 to 8000.

In 1911, Karl Fichtel died and in 1912, in order to counter the high customs duties to nearby Austria-Hungary, Sachs acquired a factory in Černýš (Tschirnitz) on the river Ohře (Eger) in Bohemia, today part of Perštejn. Somewhat later, a subsidiary factory was built in the United States. During the four years of the war, the number of Fichtel &amp; Sachs employees increased from 3,000 to around 8,000. In addition to hubs and ball bearings of all kinds, armour products were manufactured in Schweinfurt. Today&#x27;s main plant (North Plant), between Hauptbahnhof and Ernst-Sachs-Straße, is based on a weapons and projectile factory, which Fichtel &amp; Sachs built here first, in what is now the eastern plant area.

In 1919, the first works council was elected at Fichtel and Sachs, one year before the Works Councils Act &quot;()&quot; was implemented nationwide.

In the inflation year 1923, the transformation into a public company took place. A holding company of the company, the Sachs GmbH, was founded in the same year in Munich. At the turn of the year 1927/1928, the number of employees rose to a provisional high of 9,026. The hub production accounted for 67% of the total production, the remainder fell on rolling bearings. Sachs founded a company pension, the Ernst-Sachs-Hilfe.

==== Interwar period ====


In 1929, on the eve of the great recession of 1929/30, Ernst Sachs sold the rolling bearing division with 3000 coworkers, which made about half of the enterprise, to the Swedish conglomerate SKF. This merged with the Schweinfurt Fries &amp; Höpflinger AG, the Maschinenfabrik Rheinland from Krefeld, the Riebe-Werke and the rolling bearing production of the German weapons and munitions factories DWM, both in Berlin, to the United Ball Bearings AG (VKF, from 1953 SKF GmbH). With the proceeds Sachs paid off the Fichtel heirs and invested in sustainable developments, such as clutches, small engines and shock absorbers.

=== Willy Sachs era ===

==== National Socialism ====
In 1932, Ernst Sachs died, and his only son Willy Sachs took over the company. In 1937 he presented at the Saxonette auto show a 60 cc engine that could be installed in the rear hub of bicycles.

At the beginning of the Second World War, the number of employees was again at 7,000. During the war, there was no significant change in the product range. Almost every German tank was equipped with Sachs clutches. Among the over 7,000 workers in 1944, many were forced laborers.

At the end of the war, 67% of the production facilities were destroyed.

==== Early post-war period ====
In 1956, the company presented a semi-automatic transmission called Saxomat. From the end of the Second World War to the mid-1980s, Fichtel &amp; Sachs also produced single-cylinder two-stroke gasoline engines with capacities of 50 to 400 cubic centimeters, which were called StaMo. From 1953, a single-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine was built under license from Holder, which was initially used with 500, later with 400 and 600 cubic centimeters, especially in tugs and small tractors.

=== Successor ===
Consul Willy Sachs died in 1958. His son Ernst Wilhelm Sachs was appointed a full member of the executive board. In 1960, the first air-cooled Wankel engine in the world (for stationary operations) was developed. From then until the mid-1970s, small single-disc rotary engines were produced. At the Schweinfurt location alone, more than 10,000 employees were counted. In 1967, Ernst Wilhelm Sachs left the company&#x27;s executive board and, together with his brother Gunter Sachs, becomes deputy chairman of the supervisory board. On the world market, Fichtel &amp; Sachs was able to maintain a leading and sometimes dominant position in the market with its four main products - small engines, bicycle hubs, clutches and shock absorbers - until the 1980s.

In the 1960s and 1980s, Fichtel &amp; Sachs took over various other traditional brands and manufacturers of bicycles and bicycle components, including Hercules, Rabeneick, Huret, Maillard and Sedis.

In 1969, the foundation stone was laid in Schweinfurt for a second plant, the Süd plant in the new industrial area of Hafen-West, which doubles the size of the plant premises. In 1971, the Sachs racing service was built, with rally registration and support. In 1973, the wide hub program is complemented by the automatic switching two-speed Torpedo-Automatic. Ernst Wilhelm Sachs died in a 1977 heliskiing accident in Val d&#x27;Isere.

In 1981, the Foundation of Fichtel &amp; Sachs (West Africa) Ltd. in Lagos, Nigeria, together with Salzgitter AG was founded. In 1986, Fichtel &amp; Sachs started to develop prototypes for micro combined heat and power plants and started 10-year field trials.

=== Mannesmann &amp; Bosch / Siemens era ===
After the sale of the majority shareholding to the British GKN group in 1977 had been prohibited by the consumer financial conduct authorities, as well as the death of Ernst Wilhelm Sachs, the sale of the company was excluded due to a clause of his will for the next 10 years. In 1987, Gunter Sachs and his brother&#x27;s daughters sold the company to Mannesmann. In 1991, the takeover was completed by Mannesmann and the majority entry of Mannesmann in the Boge AG with the former head office in Eitorf, which was also completely taken over two years later.

In 1997, engine construction was discontinued or sold and the production of bicycle hub gears and other components sold to SRAM. Sachs Bikes took over part of the two-wheeler activities. Furthermore, this year Fichtel &amp; Sachs was renamed Mannesmann Sachs. As part of the Mannesmann takeover by Vodafone, the company went in 2000 as part of the previously founded Mannesmann Atecs to a consortium of companies around Bosch and Siemens.

=== ZF Friedrichshafen Era ===
In 2001, Fichtel &amp; Sachs was sold to ZF Friedrichshafen and renamed ZF Sachs in the same year. The traditional French chain manufacturer Sedis has been resold to the Indian bicycle and industrial holding &#x27;Tube Investments&#x27;.

As early as November 2002, a large development center was opened in the Werk-Süd.

On August 1, 2011, the company merged with ZF Friedrichshafen. As a result, ZF Sachs as an independent company, the business operations and the brand Sachs led ZF Friedrichshafen.

The Schweinfurt south plant has been continuously expanded since the takeover by ZF until today, also with a plastic center and a development center for e-mobility. In 2017, the Schweinfurt location with 9,500 employees almost reached its peak employee number from the post-war period.

== Products ==

=== Today&#x27;s product range ===
Today&#x27;s product range coming from the Schweinfurt plants of ZF Friedrichshafen AG includes drive components such as clutch systems, torque converters, dual-mass flywheels, electric drives and complete modules for hybrid vehicles, as well as suspension components such as shock absorbers and damping systems for cars, trucks, motorcycles and rail vehicles.

Examples products:

* Nivomat (a portmanteau of the French &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;) is the name for a vehicle suspension level-control technology previously created by Mannesmann-Sachs (now ZF Sachs). Compared to the common use of springs, struts, and shock absorbers in a car suspension, Nivomat replaces all of these components with a single unit per wheel which provides damping, ride control, and a self-levelling function. The Nivomat system uniquely incorporates an internal pump which relies on relative movement between the axle and the chassis to provide the levelling and damping function.

=== Sachs-Motors ===
Fichtel &amp; Sachs began producing a vehicle engine with a displacement of 74 cubic centimeters in 1930. As early as 1932, followed by a model with 98 cubic centimeters. In the 1930s, the bike with auxiliary motor &quot;Saxonette&quot;, stationary and boat engines and motorcycle engines were included in the program. After the war, the old engine range was supplemented by a large number of new designs with 50 cubic centimeter displacement for mopeds, mopeds, small and light motorcycles. Engines with larger displacement were used in small and snowmobiles and motorcycles.

The stationary engine area was expanded by two-stroke diesel engines and mower engines with different capacities. Of particular note is the development of a range of Wankel engines in various sizes for a wide variety of applications. After the assumption of the enterprise by Mannesmann the engine production was stopped 1997.

=== Bicycle components ===
Fichtel &amp; Sachs produced its own bicycle component groups until the takeover of the bicycle division by SRAM in the mid-1990s. For brake production Sachs cooperated with Modolo and in the production of derailleurs with Weinmann and Simplex.

== Renak in Reichenbach ==
In 1944, the production of the torpedo freewheel hub was outsourced from Schweinfurt to Reichenbach in the Vogtland. At the end of the war, production was interrupted. In August 1945, the operation was taken over by the state government of Saxony and handed over to the USSR on November 1, 1946, trading as part as Awtowelo. On 1 May 1952 it became the VEB vehicle parts factory Fichtel &amp; Sachs, Reichenbach the GDR. In 1956, the Renak brand was protected for the VEB Renak works (Reichenbacher hubs and coupling plants). The mid-1960s, the production of bicycle parts reached a peak with exports to 40 countries, but it was throttled and stopped the export.

On July 1, 1990, the transformation to RENAK-Werke GmbH took place. Products such as steering bearings, bottom bracket, idler sprockets and unbraked steel hubs have been discontinued. Fichtel &amp; Sachs AG took over the production of the jet hub. Under the administration of the Treuhandanstalt, the company was privatized in several sections.

The bicycle components business unit, which only produced the coaster brake hub Univers (torpedo) and Speed (Jet) and aluminum hubs, was sold to the Flying Pigeon Bicycle Group Corporation (Tianjin) from China on April 1, 1994, and the RENAK International GmbH with approx 30 employees.

On March 7, 1994, the Reichenbacher hub and bicycle components GmbH was founded and the production of the hub dynamo Enparlite (mechanically switched off, with gearbox) prepared. End of 1994, the sale of the Univers and speed hub production including the trademark RENAK Flying Pigeon back to the Reichenbacher Hubs and Fahrrad-Komponenten GmbH, which then shortened its name to RENAK Komponenten GmbH.

== Re-introduction ==
The Sachs brand was revived in 2018, and is now a major producer of bikes.

<doc id="1055610" wikidata="Q7974296" url="?curid=1055610" title="Waterloo Tunnel">
<text>The Waterloo Tunnel in Liverpool, England, is a former railway tunnel, long, which opened in 1849. Its western end was at 53.414829, -2.994385, underneath Pall Mall. From here the line continued under Great Howard Street to Waterloo Goods railway station, now the site of the Kingsway Tunnel Ventilation Shaft, after 1895 continuing beyond to the dock railway system and on to Liverpool Riverside at the Pier Head for direct connection to the passenger liners. The eastern end opens into a short () cutting, four tracks wide between Byrom Street and Fontenoy Street, which connects to the Victoria Tunnel, which emerges at Edge Hill station. It is effectively one long tunnel from Edge Hill to Liverpool Waterloo Dock with two names along its route. The tunnels were given two different names because initially trains in the Victoria Tunnel were cable hauled and in the Waterloo Tunnel locomotive hauled. Both tunnels closed on 19 November 1972.

In May 2007 it was reported that chief executive of Merseytravel, Neil Scales, had prepared a report outlining the possibilities for reuse of the Victoria/Waterloo and Wapping tunnels. Merseytravel safeguard the tunnel for future use.

In 2016, work began on replacing the road bridge on Great Howard Street that crosses over the dock entrance to the tunnel. Whilst it would have been cheaper to remove the existing bridge and in fill the resulting gap, the Department for Transport insisted the bridge was replaced at a cost of £9.7 million in order to preserve the tunnel for future use.

<doc id="1055612" wikidata="Q34558" url="?curid=1055612" title="Alexander Wetmore">
<text>Frank Alexander Wetmore (June 18, 1886 – December 7, 1978) was an American ornithologist and avian paleontologist. He was the sixth Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He was also an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences.

== Early life and education ==
The son of a physician, Frank Alexander Wetmore was born in North Freedom, Wisconsin. Developing an interest in birds at an early age, he made his first field journal entry (a pelican seen while on vacation in 1894) at the age of eight. By 1900, Wetmore published his first paper &quot;My Experience with a Red-headed Woodpecker,&quot; in the magazine Bird-Lore. To further his education Wetmore enrolled at the University of Kansas in 1905. During his studies there he did a stint as an assistant in the University Museum, under the direction of Charles D. Bunker. Alexander Wetmore later received his BA from the University of Kansas in 1912; finally receiving his MS in 1916 and his PhD in 1920 from George Washington University. Wetmore began federal service in 1910, working for the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture. In 1915, he researched the use of lead shot in causing death in waterfowl. His paleontological research led to his work on the fossil birds &quot;Palaeochenoides mioceanus&quot; and &quot;Nesotrochis debooyi&quot;.

From April 1923 to July 1924, Wetmore was the lead scientist of the Tanager Expedition, a series of five biological surveys to study the flora, fauna and geology of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Atoll and Wake Island. In 1924, Wetmore joined the Smithsonian Institution as the superintendent of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. In 1925, Wetmore was appointed assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, becoming secretary between 1945 and 1952. In 1929, he participated in the Pinchot South Sea Expedition. In 1939, he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union
He wrote &quot;A Systematic Classification for the Birds of the World&quot; (1930, revised in 1951 and 1960). This Wetmore Order received widespread acceptance, remaining popular until the end of the twentieth century. From 1944 to 1946, Wetmore served as the 15th president of The Explorers Club. Between 1946 and 1966, Wetmore made annual trips to Panama to study and collect specimens of the birds of the Isthmus. His 4-volume magnum opus, &quot;Birds of the Republic of Panama&quot;, was published by the Smithsonian between 1965 and 1984, the last volume appearing posthumously. He also served on the boards of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1946 to 1953, and of the National Geographic Society, where he served successively as vice chairman, acting chairman, and chairman emeritus of the Committee for Research and Exploration, from 1933 until his death, in his final years as a trustee emeritus.

Several taxa of birds have been named in his honor, including the Cretaceous genus &quot;Alexornis&quot; and the tanagers &quot;Wetmorethraupis sterrhopteron&quot; and &quot;Buthraupis wetmorei&quot;. Insects, mammals, amphibians, mollusks, and one plant (an Argentinian cactus), as well as a bridge in Panama and the Wetmore Glacier in the Antarctic, have also been named after him. Wetmore is commemorated in the scientific names of one species and two subspecies of reptiles: &quot;Pholidoscelis wetmorei&quot;, &quot;Uromacer frenatus wetmorei&quot;, and &quot;Anolis brevirostris wetmorei&quot;.

In 1953, he married Annie Beatrice van der Biest Thielan, who became guarantor of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union after his death in 1978. His papers and an oral history interview are held at the Smithsonian Institution.

<doc id="1055615" wikidata="Q7288062" url="?curid=1055615" title="Ralph Sandwich">
<text>Sir Ralph Sandwich (1235–1308) (also known as Rauf de Sanduiz, Ralph de Sandwich and Ralph of Sandwich), of Dene (in Margate), Ham, and Ripple, Kent, Winchfield, Hampshire, etc., was an English administrator and justice. He was Steward of the King&#x27;s Demesne, Constable of Canterbury (1278), and Royal Warden (Lord Mayor) of London (1286, 1288–1293).

==Biography==
He was the son of Simon of Sandwich, the brother of clergyman Henry of Sandwich, and Gillian Sandwich. His family had close connections with Simon de Montfort, and his uncle&#x27;s links with Montfort&#x27;s administration is most likely what brought Ralph into government. By September 1264 he had become part of the captive King&#x27;s household, and on 1 January 1265 he became Master of the Great Wardrobe. On 7 May he was made Keeper of the Great Seal, although without the governmental position which accompanied it. He was only allowed to use it for routine writs, otherwise the presence of Peter de Montfort and two others was required.

On 4 August 1265, Sandwich was captured at the Battle of Evesham fighting on the losing side for de Montfort. His lands were confiscated and given to Roger de Leybourne and his father&#x27;s lands awarded to Leybourne&#x27;s son William, who also married Juliana de Sandwich (1245-1327) on 16 October 1265; she was the daughter of Sir Henry de Sandwich (died c. 1249). After his pardon in 1266, Sandwich maintained a relationship with the Leybourne family, acting as a lawyer to Roger&#x27;s widow in 1272 and executing her will in 1276. After the death of his uncle Henry of Sandwich in 1273, he was made administrator of the See of London, having already acted as their administrator during Henry&#x27;s exile in Rome. In November 1273 he was appointed to audit the accounts of the Constable of Dover Castle, and in 1274 was summoned to attend the coronation of Edward I. In November 1275 he was one of three men appointed as a Steward of the King&#x27;s Demesne, with his responsibilities being the counties of the south and west. The post, which involved large amounts of travel, handling of huge sums of money (over £7000 between 1277 and 1279) and the supervision of large building works at Devizes, Banstead, and Odiham, completely exhausted one of his colleagues.

He also acted as Keeper of the Port of Dover, Keeper of the Forest of Dean and administrator of the See of Canterbury during the 1278–1279 vacancy. In 1280 he was appointed to negotiate for the site of New Winchelsea. A member of the King&#x27;s council, Sandwich was in 1278 appointed justice &quot;coram rege&quot; (in the presence of the King) for when the king was in Kent, and was with the judges when Alexander III of Scotland paid homage in Westminster in October. In 1285 Edward took direct control of London, appointing Sandwich as Warden of London on 1 July and Constable of the Tower on 10 September. Until 1293 Sandwich was the effective Mayor of London, and presided over the city&#x27;s Court of Hustings. He was appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1289 after the previous holder, Sir Thomas Weyland, became a fugitive &#x27;until the king makes further provision&#x27;, and stepped down in 1290 after a replacement was found. Between 1286 and 1307 he sat every year as a justice at the original Old Bailey, and sat as a justice at the trial of William Wallace at Westminster Hall in 1305.

He attended Edward II&#x27;s coronation in February 1308, and on 24 March turned the custody of the Tower of London over to John Cromwell. He died before 20 August and was buried in Greyfriars Church. In 1309 Henry de Eynesford, Nicholas de Sandwich, Thomas de Boynton, and William de Berton, clerk, executors of the will of Ralph de Sandwich, deceased were summoned to answer William de Carleton, Baron of the Exchequer, and his associates, executors of the will of William, Bishop of Norwich, deceased regarding a debt of £40. By an unknown first wife, he appears to have had a daughter, Desirée (or Desiderata) (living 1330–1), wife of Geoffrey de Lucy, Knt. He married (2nd) Maud, widow of Thomas de Belhouse, who survived him.

<text>Living Room Suite is the eighth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1978.

The album peaked at No. 133 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Production==
The album was produced by Chuck Plotkin. Chapin and his label were unhappy with the album, with Chapin going back to the studio to rerecord a few of the songs after the album had been released.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Record Collector&quot; wrote that &quot;musically, Harry occasionally steps out of his folk-friendly comfort zone, serving up some delicious blue-eyed soul on &#x27;It Seems You Only Love Me When It Rains&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="1055623" wikidata="Q158322" url="?curid=1055623" title="Stern (magazine)">
<text>Stern (, German for &quot;Star&quot;, stylized in all lowercase) is an illustrated, broadly left-liberal, weekly current affairs magazine published in Hamburg, Germany, by Gruner + Jahr, a subsidiary of Bertelsmann. Under the editorship (1948–1980) of its founder Henri Nannen, it attained a circulation of between 1.5 and 1.8 million, the largest in Europe&#x27;s for a magazine of its kind.

Unusually for a popular magazine in post-war West Germany, and most notably in the contributions to 1975 of Sebastian Haffner, &quot;Stern&quot; investigated the origin and nature of the preceding tragedies of German history. In 1983, however, its credibility was seriously damaged by its purchase and syndication of the forged Hitler Diaries. A sharp drop in sales anticipated the general fall in newsprint readership in the new century. By 2019, circulation had fallen under half a million.

==History and profile==
===Journalistic style===
Henri Nannen produced the first 16-page issue (with the actress Hildegard Knef on the cover) on 1 Aug 1948. He had been able to obtain the licence from the British military government in Hannover despite his wartime service in , a military propaganda unit in Italy. He moved the magazine to Hamburg where, in 1965, he founded , now one of the largest publishing houses in Europe.

Under Nannen&#x27;s direction, sought to present itself as an exemplar of what in Germany is called (&#x27;useful journalism&#x27;). The emphasis is on providing sufficient background on topic to allow readers opportunity to arrive at their own judgements rather than have these decided for them editorially or (as was commonly the case in the tabloid output of rival publisher ) in the headlines. As a result articles tended to be longer and more investigative, while distinguished from those of the similarly directed by the wider range of social and life-style issues covered, and by a greater reliance of illustration and graphic design.

===Breaks with the Adenauer consensus===
Stern was open to the questioning, from a liberal and left perspective, of the post-war political and social order in West Germany identified with the long Chancellorship (1949–1963) of Konrad Adenauer.

In the 1962 affair, Stern denounced as violations of constitutional norms and press freedom, the effective closure by the government of the magazine&#x27;s publishing rival. In a contest seen a key turning point in the culture of the Federal Republic away from the deference demanded by the old (&#x27;authoritarian state&#x27;), Stern (together with Springer Press and ) offered presses, teletypes and office space so it could continue publishing while being investigated for national security disclosures.

 found nothing to extenuate in the later violence of the Red Army Faction (the &quot; Gang&quot;), but in the 1960s it had not been completely hostile to the student protest movement from which the &quot;urban guerillas&quot; first emerged. In June 1967, it permitted Sebastian Haffner to denounce the police response to a demonstration in West Berlin in which student protester Benno Ohnesorg was killed, as &quot;a systematic, cold-blooded, planned pogrom&quot;. In contrast the Springer&#x27;s responded: &quot;Students threaten: We shoot back&quot;.

Like the student left, was willing to break the relative post-war silence on the recent National-Socialist past. In serialisations Haffner developed his thesis that Hitler&#x27;s war was a tragedy foretold in the circumstances of German unification in the nineteenth century. It was a position consistent with editorial support for the of the new Social-Democratic Chancellor Willi Brandt. As interpreted by many conservatives this amounted to an acceptance of Germany&#x27;s postwar division, and territorial losses in the east, as permanent.

 (No. 50, 1970) published Sven Simon&#x27;s (Axel Springer Jr.) iconic picture of Brandt kneeling before the memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising on 20 Dezember 1970 on a double spread. It was accompanied by an interview with Brandt&#x27;s Polish host, premier Józef Cyrankiewicz, with whom he had that day signed the Treaty of Warsaw. At the same time, sought to discredit the rival conservative weekly &quot;Quick&quot;, which in opposition to the Treaty had published material from its secret protocols. It accused the magazine&#x27;s editor Hans van Nouhuys of having been a double agent, at one time in the employ of the East German . successfully withstood the charge of defamation.

===Encounters with second-wave feminism===
In a further challenge to settled post-war conventions, on June 6, 1971 appeared with the headline &quot;We&#x27;ve had abortions!&quot; (Issue 24/1971). In an action initiated by Alice Schwarzer, 374 women confessed to having had pregnancies terminated. They were protesting Paragraph 218 of West Germany&#x27;s penal code, the under which abortion was illegal. The taboo-breaking publicity was viewed by many as a milestone in the feminist revival of the 1970s.
However, , itself became the target of the new feminism when, in 1978, Schwarzer and nine other women sued , and Nannen, on the grounds that the magazine&#x27;s frequent &quot;cover girls&quot; denied the human dignity of women by presenting them &quot;as a mere sexual object&quot;. The immediate occasion was a picture of the model Grace Jones, described by Schwarzer in her monthly &quot;Emma&quot; (7/1978) as &quot;a black woman, naked, in her hand a phallic microphone and around the shackles – heavy chains&quot;. (It later occurred to Schwarzer that they might also have complained of the image&#x27;s racism).

Nannen protested that the magazine&#x27;s nudes should be seen in the same light as Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;The Unclothed Maja&quot; (1797) and that the freedom of the press was at issue. The complainants proved unable in law to indict soft-pornographic practices that were rife in the popular press, but Nannen allowed that the case had &quot;made us think&quot;.

There was no obvious shift in the editorial culture of the magazine. The uncovered &quot;cover-girl&quot; tradition, sometimes in the form of celebrity shoots (&quot;With Madonna alone at home&quot;, 10 January 1992), continued. Feminists also had occasion to object to article content. In 1990, published the title story &quot;I am a masochist&quot; in which author Sina-Aline Geißler discussed her literary coming-out as a member of the BDSM scene. This caused an intense public debate, and women later occupied the magazine&#x27;s editorial offices alarmed at what they believed was a glamorisation of misogynist abuse.

===Scandal of the Hitler Diaries===

For very much more damaging publicity followed its serialisation, beginning in April 1983, of the so-called Hitler Diaries. Scientific examination soon proved that the &quot;diaries&quot;, for which the magazine had paid 9.3 million , were forgeries. The resulting fiasco led to the resignation of the magazine&#x27;s editors, a sit-in by staff to protest the &quot;management&#x27;s bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards&quot;, and a major press scandal that is still regarded as a low point in German journalism.

A publication &quot;once known for its investigative reporting&quot; became a byword for the folly and hazards of &quot;sensation-seeking check book journalism&quot;. &#x27;s credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine many years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation.

===Trump: ===

In its 24 August 2017 edition demonstrated its continued ability and willingness to generate cover-page controversy (and, for the purpose, to discard the restraints of ). A photo-shopped image depicted then United States President, Donald Trump, draped in the American flag while giving a stiff-armed Nazi salute. &quot;&quot;, read the headline, or &quot;his struggle&quot; – a reference to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s autobiographical manifesto, . The sub-headline reads: &quot;Neo Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, racism: How Donald Trump fuelled hatred in America&quot;.

The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, while critical of President Trump&#x27;s failure, in his remarks following the 13 May &quot;Unite the Right&quot; rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, to &quot;make a distinction between Nazis and KKK protesters and those who opposed them&quot;, described &quot;the depiction of the president as a latter-day Hitler by a major German publication&quot; as &quot;untrue and beyond the pale&quot;. &quot;Germans&quot;, they suggest, &quot;must surely know that by misappropriating [...] Nazi symbols and terms associated with Adolf Hitler, they belittle and becloud the crimes of the past.&quot; Jewish leaders in Germany similarly argued that the depiction of Trump as the new Hitler diminished () Nazi genocide.

Stern responded: &quot;The right-wing protesters in Charlottesville raised their arms in the Nazi salute and the American president has not distanced himself from this gesture or from the mindset of the people. On the contrary, Donald Trump had seen in some of them &#x27;fine people.&#x27; With this attitude, he identifies with the protesters and greets them in a transcendent sense – that is exactly what the cover visualises. It is, of course, far from us to want to minimise the atrocities of the National Socialists&quot;.

Trump made several other covers. For the 19 January 2017 edition he was seated on the Lincoln Memorial throne: &quot;The Emperor, how Donald Trump is changing the world and why he is so dangerous for us&quot;. For the 10 September 2020 edition he was in close up: &quot;American Psycho, how Donald Trump is systematically destroying democracy&quot;.

===Diminishing sales and circulation===
Thanks in part, perhaps, to the 1992 closure of &quot;Quick&quot;, at the turn of the century was still selling well over one million copies. Its print circulation fell to 896,000 copies in 2010 and to 390,000 in 2020, 50,000 above the illustrated, more-celebrity-oriented weekly, , but falling for the first time below that of . By October 2023 at 313,200 sales had fallen below both rivals: &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; at 690,600 and &quot;Bunte at&quot; 327,043.

&quot;Stern&quot; has had an on-line presence since 1995. The e-paper circulation of has almost tripled since 2015: from almost 8,500 copies in the second quarter of 2015 to around 26,800 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The significant decrease in the total circulation remains. Actual readership, however, is several times higher than copies sold or subscribed to online.

The fall in advertising sales has been commensurate with the fall in circulation: an advertising revenue of 218 million euros in 2003 had fallen to 107.3 million euros by 2020. It is a measure of the general decline of newsprint that in 2020 still took first place in the ranking of the popular magazines with the highest advertising sales.

It is notable that a 2013 reformatting of the printed edition mimics on-line features and conventions. There is a greater use of sidebars and infographics. The language is less formal, and there is even greater emphasis on arresting large-print photography.

<doc id="1055626" wikidata="Q4834641" url="?curid=1055626" title="Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department">
<text>The BART Police (BARTPD), officially the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department, is the transit police agency of the BART rail system in the U.S. state of California. The department has approximately three hundred police personnel, including over two hundred sworn peace officers. The chief, Kevin Franklin commands the agency&#x27;s law enforcement, parking, and community relations services. BART Police participates in a mutual aid agreement with other Bay Area law enforcement agencies. In 2011 and 2012 the department came under national scrutiny due to several officers involved in fatalities of the rail system&#x27;s patrons.

When terrorism began to be treated as a more active threat after the September 11 attacks, BART increased its emphasis on infrastructure protection. The police department hosts drills and participates in counter-terrorism working groups. The agency has an officer assigned full-time to the FBI&#x27;s Joint Terrorism Task Force. Furthermore, a command officer is designated as a mutual-aid, counter-terrorism, and homeland-security liaison. BART&#x27;s police dogs are certified in explosives detection.

The stated goal of the BART Police Department is to build a more community-oriented police force that is tough on crime and strong on customer service. Zone commanders and their personnel form working partnerships with BART riders, employees, community groups, educational institutions, and businesses. The goal is to ensure that personal safety, quality of life, and protection of property remain among BART&#x27;s top priorities for the stakeholders in its community.

== History ==
In 1969, three years before BART opened for revenue service, the transit district&#x27;s board of directors recommended that local police and sheriff&#x27;s departments patrol the stations, trains, rights-of-way, and other BART-owned properties that were within their respective jurisdictions. The police chiefs and sheriffs, forecasting that BART&#x27;s proposal would create jurisdictional disputes and inconsistent levels of police service, rejected the board&#x27;s proposal. As a result, legislation was passed to form an autonomous law enforcement agency, the BART Police Department.

During BART&#x27;s first 13 years of revenue service, police officers reported to the transit district&#x27;s headquarters in Oakland. In 1985, a team of officers was assigned to report to the Concord transportation facility, where a police field office was established. By not having to travel the 20 miles between Oakland and Concord, the officers were able to patrol their beats longer and become more familiar with the community. BART riders, station agents, and train operators benefited from having more police presence and interaction with the same officers. This led to three additional field offices within six months.

In July 1993, then-police chief Harold Taylor recommended a comprehensive plan to decentralize the department into four geographical police zones, each with its own headquarters and field offices. Zone commanders would be given personnel, equipment, and resources to manage their respective police operations. A peer-review panel, which included four police chiefs and the safety-audit administrator from the American Public Transportation Association, gave Chief Taylor&#x27;s plan its endorsement, along with other recommendations on how the BART police could work more closely with other transit employees, communities, businesses, and schools that the transit district serves.

Police command-level officers provide input to planners for BART&#x27;s future extensions to Warm Springs and Santa Clara County.

BART Police formerly had an eagle-top shield type badge, but in April 2011 switched to the 7-point star style traditional to Bay Area law enforcement. Uniforms are dark blue, similar to SFPD.

Officers are usually armed with either a SIG Sauer P320 or a Glock pistol for the sidearm.

===Officer-involved fatalities===

====Bruce Edward Seward====
In 2001, a mentally ill man named Bruce Edward Seward was shot by an officer at the Hayward Station. Reportedly the sleeping passenger awoke and grabbed the officer&#x27;s nightstick causing the officer to reflexively shoot him; resulting in death.

====Oscar Grant====
In 2009, officer Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant III on the Fruitvale station.

Eyewitnesses gathered direct evidence of the shooting with cellular video cameras which were later submitted to social networks such as YouTube in addition to media outlets. The videos were watched hundreds of thousands of times online. In the days following the shooting, peaceful and violent demonstrations occurred.

After an investigation and public uproar, Mehserle was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, to which he pleaded not guilty. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2010 and was sentenced to two years. Mehserle served his sentence at the Los Angeles County Jail and was released in 2011 on parole.

Subsequent to the criminal trial Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris filed a US$25 million wrongful death civil lawsuit against BART on behalf of Grant&#x27;s daughter and girlfriend.

In response to the Grant shooting, BART created a civilian oversight committee to monitor police-related incidents. The civilian oversight of the BART Police Department is directly attributable to the leadership of Assemblyman Sandre Swanson who authored the legislation, BART director Carole Ward Allen who lobbied members of the California state legislature to create an oversight committee with an Independent Auditor position, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who signed the bill into law.

====Charles Hill====
In 2011, a mentally ill homeless man, Charles Blair Hill, assaulted two officers with weapons at the Civic Center / UN Plaza station in San Francisco. As a result, he was shot by BART police. The department reported that Hill was drunk and armed with two knives and a broken bottle. Approximately twenty-three seconds after arriving on scene, the officers fired three rounds, striking Hill in the chest and killing him. BART Police chief Kenton Rainey stated lethal force was appropriate.

The shooting of Charles Hill led to a non-violent but disruptive demonstration by approximately seventy-five protesters inside the Civic Center and 16th Street Stations on July 11. Demonstrators departing the 16th St Mission station returned downtown on Mission St, blocking traffic and engaging in acts of vandalism en route. One citizen was arrested for intoxication.

====Sahleem Tindle====
Officer Joseph Mateu shot and killed Sahleem Tindle in January 2018. Officer Mateu had heard shots, and ran to the scene where two men were fighting over a gun. He intervened, firing into Tindle&#x27;s back three times. The shooting resulted in a civil rights lawsuit against BART. Prosecutors wound up declining to file any charges.

===Cell phone network shutdown===
On August 11, 2011, BART officials successfully prevented another evening-commute anti-police demonstration by shutting down the public cell phone network serving their jurisdiction in and between the downtown San Francisco stations. The police had received information that the protest was to be coordinated live via internet and text messages. This was the first documented instance of any government agency in the United States shutting down public communications to disrupt a protest. The American Civil Liberties Union called the decision &quot;in effect an effort by a governmental entity to silence its critics.&quot;

== Operations ==

The BART police have various positions in their ranks. including peace officers, community service officers, dispatchers, revenue protection guards, and administrative staff. Most officers are assigned to patrol, and others are assigned to special operations teams.

The department&#x27;s decentralized patrol bureau is divided into six police zones. Each has its own headquarters and field office(s). The police department has: criminal investigation, personnel and training, record, warrant, crime analysis, traffic administration, property and evidence, and revenue protection divisions. There is also the office of the chief which is composed of an internal affairs and a budget coordination office.

Further specialties for the police department include: field training officer, K9, background investigations, crime analyst, administrative traffic officer, FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) investigator, special-enforcement teams, recruiting and personnel, and crisis intervention teams.

The agency has police facilities in: Castro Valley, Daly City, Concord, El Cerrito, Hayward, Oakland, Pittsburg, Pleasanton, San Bruno, San Francisco, San Leandro, Fremont, San Jose, and Walnut Creek.

==Fallen officer==
One BART police officer has died in the line of duty.

<text>Walter Giffard (April 1279) was Lord Chancellor of England and Archbishop of York.

==Family==

Giffard was a son of Hugh Giffard of Boyton in Wiltshire, a royal justice, by Sibyl, a daughter and co-heiress of Walter de Cormeilles. He was born about 1225, and may have been the oldest son. Hugh and Sybil were entrusted with the care of the young Prince Edward in 1239. In 1256 Giffard and his mother received the king&#x27;s licence to live in Boyton Castle. Giffard&#x27;s brother was Bishop Godfrey Giffard, who was Bishop of Worcester and also Lord Chancellor of England; his sister Mabel was the Abbess of Shaftesbury Abbey. Walter was also a kinsman of William of Bitton I, who was Walter&#x27;s predecessor at Bath. The family was also related to Walter de Gray, who was Archbishop of York from 1215 to 1255.

==Career==
Giffard studied at Cambridge University and took his Master of Arts at Oxford University. While at university Adam Marsh wrote to another scholar praising Giffard&#x27;s scholarly skills. Giffard took holy orders and became a canon and archdeacon of Wells and a papal chaplain. On 22 May 1264 he was elected Bishop of Bath and Wells and received the temporalities on 1 September 1264. As the Archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy was in France, Giffard travelled to Paris to be consecrated at Notre-Dame on 4 January 1265. The service was performed by Peter d&#x27;Acquablanca, the Bishop of Hereford, Giffard having first sworn that he would not take part against King Henry III. However, the barons were angered that he had ventured abroad against their will and ravaged nearly all his manors. Archbishop Boniface ordered him to excommunicate Simon de Montfort the Earl of Leicester and his party on Giffard&#x27;s return to England. Following the Battle of Evesham, on 10 August 1265 King Henry made Giffard Chancellor and awarded him a stipend of five hundred marks a year. In August of the following year he was appointed one of the arbitrators for drawing up the Dictum of Kenilworth which provided the disinherited lords a means of recovering their estates.

On 15 October 1266 Giffard was appointed by Pope Clement IV to the Archbishopric of York. As part of this elevation he resigned the chancellorship and was enthroned on 1 November 1266, receiving his temporalities on Boxing Day. Soon after his enthronement he became involved in a dispute with Archbishop Boniface of Canterbury about the right to carry his cross erect in the southern province, and ended up making an appeal to Rome.

Although Giffard had family wealth and much money associated with his office, he could not keep clear of debt. In the years after his appointment he paid 1600 marks to Italian money-lenders, 550 marks to certain merchants of Paris, and in 1270 sent 200 marks to his agents at Rome to expedite his affairs, hoping, &quot;...for the present to keep out of the whirlpool of usury.&quot; Despite his own financial problems he seems to have been kind to his relatives, paying for his nephew&#x27;s education and giving his brother Godfrey the Archdeaconry of York. His register contains many gifts to the poor, and he helped support schoolmasters at Beverley. He also supported the scholarly careers of two of his successors at York, John le Romeyn and William Greenfield.

On 13 October 1269 Giffard officiated at the translation of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s relics. When leaving England, Prince Edward (who was then heir to the throne) appointed him by will in 1270 as one of the tutors of his sons. He also assisted Edward in bringing John de Warenne the Earl of Surrey to justice for the murder of Alan la Zouche at Westminster. Upon the death of Henry III on 20 November 1272 the Great Seal was delivered to the Archbishop as first Lord of the Council in order for him, Roger Mortimer and Robert Burnell to be appointed to govern the Kingdom until the return of the new king, now Edward I, to the country in August 1274. Giffard again acted in this capacity during the king&#x27;s absence in 1275.

==Death==
Giffard died at York on or about 22 April 1279, and he was buried in York Minster, probably in the choir. Archbishop Thoresby later removed his body to a tomb which he had erected in the presbytery. Contemporary reports state that Giffard was a handsome, happy and genial man who was fond of luxury; as a result of this in later life he grew fat which affected both his health and his temper. He was noted at the time as being a man of high character who was able and industrious.

Originally called &quot;Lieder der Zeit Musikverlag&quot;, VEB Deutsche Schallplatten was founded in 1947 by Ernst Busch, a socialist singer and actor.

On April 1, 1953, the private GmbH-company had to change to a state-controlled VEB (Volkseigener Betrieb, &quot;People-owned enterprise&quot;).

On March 18, 1955, the &quot;VEB Lied Der Zeit&quot; was renamed to &quot;VEB Deutsche Schallplatten Berlin&quot;.

In 1990, it became Deutsche Schallplatten GmbH Berlin (DSB). 

== Labels ==
Labels of VEB Deutsche Schallplatten included:
* Amiga for contemporary pop, rock music and jazz
* Eterna for classical music, operas, operettas
* Litera for radio plays, poetry readings

<text>Latter Days is a 2003 American romantic comedy drama film about the relationship between a closeted Mormon missionary and his openly gay neighbor. The film was written and directed by C. Jay Cox and stars Steve Sandvoss as the missionary, Aaron, and Wes Ramsey as the neighbor, Christian. Joseph Gordon-Levitt appears as Elder Ryder and Rebekah Johnson as Julie Taylor. Mary Kay Place, Khary Payton, Erik Palladino, Amber Benson, and Jacqueline Bisset have supporting roles.

&quot;Latter Days&quot; premiered at the Philadelphia International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival on July 10, 2003, and was released in various U.S. states over the next 12 months. Later the film was shown at several gay film festivals. It was the first film to portray LGBTQ Mormon characters, and the conflict between the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and same-sex romantic and sexual relationships. Showings in some U.S. states were controversial. Various religious groups demanded that the film be withdrawn from theaters and video stores under boycott threats.

The film was met with mixed reactions from film critics but was popular with most film festival attendees. At the North American box office, &quot;Latter Days&quot; made about $835,000, which barely covered the production&#x27;s budget of $850,000. In 2004, freelance writer T. Fabris adapted the film into a novel, which was published by Alyson Publications.

==Plot==
Elder Aaron Davis, a young Mormon from Pocatello, Idaho, is sent to Los Angeles with three other missionaries to spread the faith. They move into an apartment next to openly gay party boy Christian Markelli and his roommate Julie, an aspiring singer. Christian and Julie work as servers at Lila&#x27;s, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne.

Christian makes a bet with his co-workers that he can seduce one of the Mormons, and soon comes to believe that Aaron, the least experienced missionary, is a closeted homosexual. Aaron and Christian become acquainted through several encounters in the apartment complex. When Christian accidentally injures himself, Aaron helps him indoors and cleans his wound. Christian attempts to seduce Aaron, but the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian&#x27;s remark that sex &quot;doesn&#x27;t have to mean anything&quot;. Aaron accuses him of being shallow and walks out. Worried that Aaron is correct, Christian joins a charity, delivering meals to people with AIDS. He gains new insights through a friendship with one of the beneficiaries. Aaron meets and befriends Lila, whose life partner has died, unaware of her connection to Christian.

Aaron&#x27;s fellow missionary, Paul Ryder, has a cycling accident. Returning to his apartment, a distraught Aaron encounters Christian, who tries to comfort him with a hug. Both men are overwhelmed by their feelings and end up kissing, failing to notice the return of Aaron&#x27;s roommates. Aaron is sent home in disgrace, leading Christian to confront Ryder, who is angry that Christian corrupted Aaron for no reason. Christian admits that he initially just wanted to win a bet, but says &quot;it&#x27;s not about that&quot; anymore. Seeing Christian&#x27;s distress, Ryder tells him that Aaron&#x27;s flight has a five-hour layover in Salt Lake City.

Christian finds Aaron standing outside the airport terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his misgivings, Aaron admits his own feelings of love. With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron&#x27;s pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is excommunicated by the church elders, led by his father, who is the stake president. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him that he must pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that he might be gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. His parents send him to a treatment facility in an attempt to change his sexual orientation.

Christian locates Aaron&#x27;s home address and phone number. Aaron&#x27;s mother informs him that, &quot;Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; thanks to you I have lost my son.&quot; Believing Aaron is dead, Christian spends the next few days thinking continually about Aaron. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron&#x27;s watch to his mother. After looking at the watch&#x27;s inscription, which mentions charity, she tries to go after Christian, but he has already left.

Julie writes a song based on Christian&#x27;s journal entry about the ordeal. Julie shows Christian her video for the song, and he is upset that Julie used his writings without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something good would come from it. In the treatment facility, Aaron hears Julie&#x27;s song when her video airs on television. The video prompts Aaron to return to Los Angeles in search of Christian. When a stranger answers the door to Christian&#x27;s apartment, Aaron is heartbroken, thinking that Christian has returned to his party boy ways and moved on. Having nowhere else to go, Aaron makes his way to Lila&#x27;s restaurant and begins to recount his journey to her. Christian walks into the dining room, and is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate Thanksgiving with Christian&#x27;s co-workers. Lila tells everyone that, no matter what, they will always have, &quot;a place at my table, and a place in my heart&quot;.

==Cast==

* Steve Sandvoss as Elder Aaron Davis, a young Latter-day Saint from Pocatello, Idaho, who falls in love with Christian and must choose between his sexuality and his church. The producers auditioned a large number of people before casting Sandvoss, saying he &quot;blew us away.&quot;
* Wes Ramsey as Christian William Markelli, an LA party boy aspiring to be an actor, Christian has his ideas of happiness and the meaning of life challenged when he falls for the simple but kind-hearted Aaron. Ramsey said on the DVD Special featurette, &quot;The character of Christian was on so many levels intriguing to me. I was just so excited and feel very blessed to have the opportunity to tell that story through his eyes.&quot;
* Rebekah Johnson as Julie Taylor, Christian&#x27;s roommate who tries to break out into the music world and on the way stop Christian from falling apart.

* Jacqueline Bisset as Lila Montagne, the owner of Lila&#x27;s, a restaurant where Christian, Traci, Julie, and Andrew work. Her lover is terminally ill in hospital, but she still finds time to support Christian and Aaron with her witty and sarcastic advice. Bisset herself said, &quot;I like humor, so I just, I really enjoyed doing all the cracks.&quot;
* Amber Benson as Traci Levine; Traci has moved from New York to LA to become an actress and works at Lila&#x27;s to support herself. Traci does not like living in LA, but later admits she did not like New York much either.
* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, judgmental young missionary assigned as Aaron&#x27;s partner, Ryder is not enthusiastic about being in LA and even less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but good sense of humor made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.

* Khary Payton as Andrew, an aspiring actor, but one who spends more time at Lila&#x27;s gossiping and telling racy anecdotes. Andrew has been HIV positive for quite some time, but remains in good health.
* Rob McElhenney as Elder Harmon, the oldest of the LDS missionaries who has been assigned as their leader.
* Dave Power as Elder Gilford, Harmon&#x27;s missionary partner.
* Erik Palladino as Keith Griffin, a gay man dying of AIDS, drowning in his own bitterness and despair until befriended by Christian. Cox said that Palladino&#x27;s performance was not how he originally envisioned it, but he could not now imagine a different person playing Keith.
* Mary Kay Place as Sister Gladys Davis, Aaron&#x27;s deeply religious mother, who, despite showing unconditional love and affection toward Aaron before he leaves for Los Angeles, cannot accept the fact that her son is gay.
* Jim Ortlieb as Elder Farron Davis, Aaron&#x27;s father, who serves as a Latter-day Saint Stake President in Pocatello, excommunicates Aaron from the church upon learning that he is gay. Farron is portrayed as a distant, evasive individual.
* Linda Pine as Susan Davis, the only Davis who accepts her brother&#x27;s homosexuality. In a deleted scene, she tells Aaron that his homosexuality has changed nothing between them. She also discovers Aaron&#x27;s suicide attempt, and in a panic, is able to save him just in time.

==Themes==
Cox has stated that the film is primarily about a love story between two characters. There is also an exploration of religious attitudes towards homosexuality, and the dilemma of religious homosexuals, torn between who they are and what they believe. A non-fiction film with similar themes that has been contrasted with &quot;Latter Days&quot; is &quot;Trembling Before G-d&quot;.

Cox has also said that there is a massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a religion so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality. In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay. Nevertheless, a major theme of &quot;Latter Days&quot; is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.

==Production==
&quot;Latter Days&quot; was written and directed by C. Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story. Cox based both characters – Christian and Aaron – on himself. He was raised as a Mormon and served a mission before coming out as gay, and had wondered what the two halves of himself would have said to each other if they had ever met. 
&quot;Latter Days&quot; was filmed in several locations in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget. After Cox had financed the search for initial backing, funding was acquired from private investors who wanted to see the film made. However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained difficult. It was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, who picked it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.

Despite coming from a Mormon background, Cox had to research details of the excommunication tribunal, which is held after Aaron is sent back to Idaho. Former Mormons told him about their experiences and provided Cox with &quot;a pretty accurate representation, right down to the folding tables.&quot; According to Cox experienced actress Jacqueline Bisset also added valuable suggestions for improvements to the story.

Casting for the two main characters did not focus on their sexuality, but their ability &quot;to show vulnerability&quot;. In a behind-the-scenes commentary, Steve Sandvoss explains that he did not want to play his character as a gay character, and Wes Ramsey emphasizes that the love story aspect of the film to him was detached from the character&#x27;s gender. Due to several nude and kissing scenes, &quot;Latter Days&quot; was released unrated.

==Release==
&quot;Latter Days&quot; premiered at the Philadelphia International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival on July 10, 2003, where it received a standing ovation. When the cast came on stage, they received another standing ovation. The film had a similar reception both at OutFest a week later and at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. The film also screened at the Seattle and Washington film festivals before being released across the United States over the following 12 months. Later, the film was shown at numerous gay film festivals and released internationally, namely in Barcelona and Madrid (where it was also a popular pick) and in Mexico City. Since its initial release, it received nine best film awards, as Cox mentioned in 2005 on a featurette included on the United Kingdom DVD.

The film was banned by Madstone Theaters, an arthouse cinema chain with nine theaters across the country, which claimed it was &quot;not up to [our] artistic quality&quot;. The company was pressured with threatened boycotts and protests by conservative groups to withdraw their planned release. At the North American box office, &quot;Latter Days&quot; made $834,685 from a total of 19 theaters. As of January 2011, the film was the top-grossing film from its distributor, TLA Releasing.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Critics&#x27; reviews have been mixed; on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 46% of 48 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average score of 5.4/10. Frank Scheck, reviewer for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, wrote: &quot;Cox&#x27;s screenplay, while occasionally lapsing into the sort of clichés endemic to so many gay-themed films, generally treats its unusual subject matter with dignity and complexity.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert gave it two and a half stars out of four, declaring that the script was peopled from the &quot;Stock Characters Store&quot; and &quot;the movie could have been a.) a gay love story, or b.) an attack on the Mormon Church, but is an awkward fit by trying to be c.) both at the same time.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commented &quot;this movie is often as kitschy and artificial as ... &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;&quot; (another film written by Cox).

Other reviewers were more favourable, such as &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; critic Liz Braun, who said &quot;Latter Days&quot; was &quot;the most important gay male movie of the past few years.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented: &quot;At once romantic, earthy and socially critical, &quot;Latter Days&quot; is a dynamic film filled with humor and pathos.&quot; Gary Booher, an editor for the LGBTQ Mormon organization , said &quot;It was so realistic that it was scary. I felt exposed as the particulars of my experience and of others I know was brazenly spread across the big screen for all to behold.&quot;

===Awards===
==Soundtrack==
Eric Allaman scored the soundtrack to the film after shooting wrapped, and composed much of the score himself. Several scenes featuring the rapid passing of time, such as Christian&#x27;s desperate search for Aaron at Salt Lake City Airport, were scored with techno style beats, and scenes with emotional content were given a more &quot;ambient &#x27;tronica feel&quot;. A total of three songs were written by C. Jay Cox for Rebekah Johnson to sing: &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Another Beautiful Day&quot;, and &quot;Tuesday 3:00 a.m.&quot;. Allaman was very impressed with Cox&#x27;s musical ability, and both men composed more songs as background music.

The official soundtrack album was released on October 26, 2004. Due to contractual reasons, Johnson did not appear on the album, and her character&#x27;s songs were performed by Nita Whitaker instead.

==Novelization and other releases==
In 2004, the &quot;Latter Days&quot; screenplay was adapted into a novel by freelance writer T. Fabris, which was published by Alyson Publications. The book was faithful to the film, but added several extra scenes that explained confusing aspects of the film and gave more about the characters&#x27; backgrounds. For example, the reason Ryder tells Christian where to find Aaron is his own broken heart over a girl he fell in love with while on his mission training. The novel also added dialogue that had been cut out of the film: finishing, for example Christian&#x27;s cry – in the film – of &quot;That&#x27;s the hand I use to…&quot; with &quot;masturbate with&quot;.

In France, &quot;Latter Days&quot; has been titled &quot;La Tentation d&#x27;Aaron&quot; (&quot;The Temptation of Aaron&quot;), and the DVD given a cover showing Aaron in a nude and suggestive pose. A new trailer was also released, which is considerably more sexual than the original. In Italy, &quot;Latter Days&quot; is distributed by Fourlab. The film was re-titled &quot;Inguaribili Romantici&quot; (&quot;Hopeless Romantics&quot;), shown on pay-TV on Sky Show in December 2006, and then released on DVD by Fourlab&#x27;s gay-themed label &quot;OutLoud!&quot;. The film is also available in an Italian-language-dubbed version.

<text>West Bengal Socialist Party (WBSP) was a political party in the Indian state of West Bengal. WBSP was formed when the Bengali socialists in the then Janata Party split in the beginning of the 1980s (the other faction became the Democratic Socialist Party). WBSP was a part of Left Front. The party leader, Kiranmoy Nanda, was the Fisheries Minister in the West Bengal government.

The party upheld the ideals of Jayaprakash Narayan, Ram Manohar Lohia and Narendra Dev.

In 1990s, the party merged with the Samajwadi Party of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Kiranmoy Nanda became one of the national secretaries of SP. But due to the differences between SP and the Communists in April, 1999 over supporting Congress in forming a government after the defeat of the Vajpayee government in the trust vote, WBSP was resurrected once again.

In the state assembly elections 2001 WBSP launched four candidates, supported by Left Front. All four got elected. In total the party received 246 407 votes. In 2005 municipal polls in Kolkata, WBSP contested 2 seats (ward no. 55 and 63) as a part of LF. It lost in both seats.

In the 2006 West Bengal state assembly election, WBSP retained its four seats.
Senor leaders of the party included Moni Pal and Jonmejay Ojha. The party has influences in parts of East Midnapore, Malda, Nadia and Murshidabad.

In 2008 Panchayat Elections, it has secured a zilla parishad seat in Malda.
It won 2 municipality seats in the Krishnagar municipality in 2008.

In April 2010, WBSP merged with the Samajwadi Party of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Kiranmoy Nanda again became a general secretary of SP.

<doc id="1055651" wikidata="Q153059" url="?curid=1055651" title="Deep fryer">
<text>A deep fryer (or deep fat fryer) is a kitchen appliance used to cook foods by full immersion in hot oil—deep frying. The cooking oil (or fats) are typically between temperatures of .

Long common in commercial kitchens, household models now available have become increasingly prevalent.

Deep frying has become well known in the United States, from frying sticks of butter to Twinkies, but the method can be traced back to Roman times.

==Features==

Deep fryers generally have a basket to lower the food into the oil tank and raise it when the food has finished cooking. Fryer baskets purchased separately are not standardized and when selected, need to fit into the deep fryer. There are timers and alarms, automatic devices to raise and lower the basket into and out of the oil, ventilation systems to exhaust frying odors from the kitchen, an oil filtration system or chemical treatment to improve the re-usability of the same amount of oil, and mechanical or electronic temperature controls that save energy and prevent fires by continuously sensing and adjusting the temperature of the oil.

==Construction==

The modern commercial fryer has improved energy efficiency, resulting from better heat transfer systems. Commercial fryers with infrared heating or convection heating are efficient, but often expensive. Infrared heating uses a radiant heat transfer process and convection heating operates through air circulating, while standard fryers utilize hot combustion gases. Most standard fryers are very hot, so they should be handed carefully. The most common fryer models are electric and gas fryers.

Electric restaurant fryers are popular in counter top models, because of their mobility and easy installation. They lose less heat than gas fryers, because their heating elements are immersed in the oil and have a faster temperature recovery time between frying cycles. Gas fryers heat up more quickly and to a higher cooking temperature than electric fryers. They can be powered by either natural gas or propane, both of which are generally less expensive energy sources than electricity. This makes gas power especially popular in floor model fryers. Commercial fryers are generally available in mild steel or stainless steel. Stainless steel is less likely to corrode or stain than mild steel. Mild steel also expands under heat, which may damage the welds over time. Because of this, stainless steel fryers often come with a much longer warranty than mild steel fryers.

Some commercial fryers have a &quot;cold zone&quot; at the bottom of the fry pot. This is where food particles, such as breading, batter or broken off pieces of food, sink to, while the lower temperature keeps them from burning and tainting the oil. A tube-style fry pot has a large cold zone because the tubes are slightly above the bottom of the vat, leaving generous space for cooler oil and crumbs. This is particularly useful for cooking heavily breaded foods (such as a blooming onion). A tube-style fry pot is more difficult to clean than an open fry pot, but the tubes allow easy access to the heat source. Tube fryers are often less expensive than their open fry pot counterparts.

Open fry pots have an external heat source, which makes them easier to clean and affords better access to the oil, but they generally offer a smaller cold zone, so food particles could pollute the flavor of the oil. However, these fryers work very well for lightly breaded foods. Flat-bottomed restaurant fryers (another type of open fry pot fryer) can also be difficult to clean and have no cold zone, but they are highly effective for frying dough. Flat-bottom fryer pots may also be used with a batter trapping insert that keeps loose batter from quickly scorching on the bottom where the heat is applied normally. A batter trap can also help keep loose batter from being stirred up in the oil and adhering to subsequent batches of food in order to make foods taste better and extend the cooking oil&#x27;s usability.

Some domestic fryers incorporate an angled motorized rotary basket that circulates its contents through the hot oil. This design reduces the amount of oil required to roughly half compared to a more traditionally designed fryer. Domestic fryers are generally much smaller than their commercial counterparts and typically have a capacity of two to four liters.
==Temperature controls==
Temperature controls for deep fryers can be implemented, but are uncommon. Without them the deep fryer needs to be watched consistently to ensure safety. There sometimes are &quot;computerized temperature controls&quot; in fryers on the market today, especially in commercial fryers. In fact, some modern fryers have an automatic shutoff control, just in case the temperature gets too high, which adds another level of sophistication and safety. It is a good idea to use a separate or external thermometer, even if the unit has temperature controls, in case there is a malfunction and to ensure that the internal temperature of the food meets government regulations.

==Oil filtration==
An oil filtration system, chemical treatment, or absorbent powder (diatomaceous earth or synthetic magnesium silicates) all help remove tiny food particles that are not always visible. Using these systems doubles the life of the oil. Oil filtration systems can sometimes be purchased as an enclosed part of the fryer to avoid involving employees in the somewhat dangerous process of filtering the oil with an exterior system. Many restaurants use a portable oil filtration system to transport waste oil to a disposal area. However, even old oil is not completely useless. There are ways (involving other chemicals and machinery) to &quot;recycle&quot; old oil as biodiesel that can power diesel vehicles. Bio-diesel increases energy security resulting in many environmental benefits and even helping decrease greenhouse emissions. Pouring used oil, such as fats and grease, down the drain should be avoided, as this can cause food build up and clogged pipes, restricting the flow of liquids. This often results in costly restoration and cleaning.

==Accessories==
Deep fryer accessories are products that are designed to improve the process of frying. A typical accessory of a deep fryer is the frying basket, which holds items to be fried and lets users take the food out of the fryer without using other tools. A skimmer is a screen (either coarse, medium, or fine) attached to a handle and used to remove food from the fryer. A thermometer is an essential accessory of a deep fryer because the temperature is critical to get the best-tasting food and ensure that the food is cooked to an appropriate temperature. To make sure the fryer itself stays in good condition, a cleaning solution is required, while a pump and filter can help to keep the oil clean. Cleaning brushes help to scrape away burnt bits of food from the sides and bottom of the fryer without damaging it.

==Automated deep fryers==

The automated deep fryer has a different system that incorporates a single basket unit or double basket unit, which could be useful in loading, cooking, and serving food. The refrigerated storage compartment has a portion controller and dispenser, a separate cooking chamber having a frying vessel. Most automated deep fryers include an air filtration system which gets rid of the greasy smell of fried foods. The system additionally incorporates a microprocessor controller. Some automated deep fryer have an automated feature to ensure that the food is cooked consistently at the correct temperature and for the correct amount of time.

== Fire risks and personal safety ==

Since cooking foods at high temperatures in order to kill bacteria and pathogens is required, cautionary measures need to be taken into consideration. One of these precautions is the use of water and other solutions around deep fryers because water or ice that meets hot oils is likely to gurgle, splash, and bubble onto nearby surfaces or objects. In fact, the use of water or ice with hot oil can cause the water to evaporate at that high temperature leading to severe bodily injury or heated explosions. This is commonly referred to as the flash point and should always be avoided. It is always best to use a chemical agent like a fire extinguisher or cover the oil with a non-porous object like a metal lid or platter instead of liquids like water. Another precaution to consider when using a deep fat fryer to make sure that the oil does not overflow when food items are placed into the fryer and that the food item can be completely submerged to ensure even cooking, especially for large objects like a turkey. If the oil meets flames, from stove top burners and other sources, the results can be life-threatening like heated or gaseous oils that can explode nearby workstations while causing wall and ceiling fires. Another factor that can cause oil fires is the environment surrounding the deep fryer such as keeping the work area clear of objects and placing hot oil containers/fryers on smooth surfaces so that they do not spill. Furthermore, carbon monoxide can be created from deep-frying and little ventilation/air flow can cause people in the area to be poisoned, which is especially dangerous, so carbon monoxide detectors should be maintained in working order.

<text>Solomon Grundy (Cyrus Gold) is a supervillain and occasional antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was originally depicted as a murder victim brought back to life as a corporeal revenant or zombie, though subsequent versions of the character have occasionally depicted a different origin. His name is taken from the 19th century nursery rhyme &quot;Solomon Grundy&quot;.

Grundy was introduced as an enemy of comic book hero Alan Scott (the original Green Lantern), but has since become a prominent enemy for a number of superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and other members of the Justice League. As a revenant whose backstory often involves coming back to life after being deposited in the swamp, later writers have also given him ties to Swamp Thing, one of DC&#x27;s horror-fantasy heroes.

Solomon Grundy has been adapted into numerous media outside comics, including television series and films. Mark Hamill and Fred Tatasciore, among others, have voiced the character in animation. The character made his live-action debut as The Acolyte in the second season of the Arrowverse series &quot;Arrow&quot;, portrayed by Graham Shiels, and appeared as [[Butch Gilzean]] in the first four seasons of Fox&#x27;s television series &quot;Gotham&quot;, portrayed by Drew Powell. Grundy also appeared in the first and second seasons of &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed via CGI.

==Publication history==
Created by Alfred Bester, he first appeared in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #61 (October 1944).

Grundy is the focus of one of the four &quot;Faces of Evil&quot; one-shots that explore the aftermath of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, written by Scott Kolins and Geoff Johns, with art by Shane Davis. It is the introduction to a seven part mini-series featuring the character.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
====Earth-Two version&#x27;s history====

In the late 19th century, a wealthy merchant named Cyrus Gold is murdered and his body is disposed of in Slaughter Swamp, near Gotham City. Fifty years later, he is reanimated as a zombie-like creature composed partly of swamp matter with no memory of his previous life. He becomes an enemy of the Green Lantern, Alan Scott, proving to be a difficult enemy due to being made of wood and thus resistant to his powers.

A criminal scientist calling himself the Baron of York kills his brother and takes over his gang, stating to them that he knows where to find the body of Solomon Grundy. Once the body is found, the Baron of York injects Grundy with concentrated chlorophyll upon knowing his background. The side effect turns Solomon Grundy into a plant. When the Baron of York bluffs about him being worshipped and served, Solomon Grundy kills the Baron of York and takes over his gang. While noting that Solomon Grundy is more invulnerable to his ring due to the chlorophyll, Green Lantern chases after Solomon Grundy until he becomes exhausted in the petrified forest in Arizona. Using his ring, Green Lantern traps Grundy in a green plasma bubble for a time.

A freak weather occurrence releases Solomon Grundy from his prison. Making his way across country, Grundy heads for the headquarters of the Justice Society of America. Green Lantern arrives early for the meeting and when the other members arrive, they find their headquarters smashed to pieces and Green Lantern missing from the ranks. Johnny turns on the radio, which blares the warning that Solomon Grundy is on the loose; the members believe, based on a large, muddy footprint on the floor, that Grundy got to HQ and took Green Lantern. The radio continues its report, listing cities where Grundy was seen, so each member picks a city and heads for it to try to find Green Lantern while Wonder Woman stays behind. The scene now shifts back to the moment at JSA HQ where Green Lantern had opened the door. To his surprise, Doiby Dickles walks in, and informs him that Grundy has freed himself and is on the loose. Green Lantern leaves immediately, hoping to find Grundy before any of the JSA members are hurt going after him. Minutes later, Grundy arrives at JSA HQ, and, not finding the Lantern there, he smashes the place up, then leaves. Green Lantern and Doiby use a special radio-like device Alan Scott had developed that is attuned to the mental wavelengths of Grundy himself; Green Lantern calculates the path of Grundy and announces over the radio in JSA HQ where Grundy will strike. When Green Lantern and Grundy meet, Grundy rips a tree out by its roots and smashes it into the Lantern. Green Lantern fights back with his power ring and fists until both men fall into a nearby stream and over a small waterfall. The Lantern is severely dazed and tries to ward off Grundy with his ring, but he is much too weak. Grundy grabs Green Lantern by the throat and begins to squeeze the life out of him, holding his head underwater. However, Hawkman strikes Grundy with his mace, and Doctor Mid-Nite revives the Lantern. A combined attack brings down Grundy, and Green Lantern deposits Grundy on a distant, lifeless planet.

A battle soon commences when Grundy&#x27;s body gravitates towards young astronomer Dick Cashmere as he learns to ride light waves, resulting in his assuming Cashmere&#x27;s identity for a time while leaving the real one bound and gagged, though the Society finds him soon after. In this incarnation, he gains intelligence, which he subsequently loses when Green Lantern defeats and buries Grundy in 1947.

At this point, Grundy is freed and enlisted along with several other supervillains by the time-traveling criminal Per Degaton in his second appearance, who has traveled to 1941 to capture the Justice Society of America on the day of the attack on timeline, hoping to change history and take over the world. Grundy encounters Green Lantern, Flash, and Wonder Woman in Echo Park, whom Grundy knows from 1947. Grundy bests the costumed trio, and is summoned by a mysterious voice to deliver them or &quot;pay the penalty&quot;. The All-Star Squadron comes to their rescue, and Grundy is the last villain to be transported back. He is thrust back to the Moon, where he remains for over two decades, as this timeline is erased once Degaton is defeated.

After many years, Grundy is knocked loose from his planet prison and returns to Earth to battle Green Lantern, Hourman, and Doctor Fate. At this point, he has temporary mastery over all wooden objects. Solomon Grundy is imprisoned orbiting the Earth in a stronger bubble created by the combined powers of Green Lantern and Doctor Fate.

Grundy was once pulled to Earth-One and substituted for the superstrong Blockbuster due to a machine that was accidentally pulling the Earths together in warp-space and substituting people. During this event, he had absorbed some of Doctor Fate&#x27;s magic, is stronger than before, and is even able to telekinetically lift Flash into the air. He hates Green Lantern so much he thinks everyone he sees is Green Lantern. He is imprisoned inside a mountain by Earth-One Green Lantern after being lifted up by Earth-One Hawkman and dazed by blows from all the heroes, but when the machine is turned off he is substituted for Blockbuster on Earth-Two and renews the attack, defeating numerous heroes. However, the JSA and JLA went to battle an Anti-Matter being that was threatening both Earths in Warp-Space after being summoned by Doctor Fate, who had sensed the threat due to the Spectre. As the heroes return, they find Green Lantern had placed Grundy and Blockbuster together to occupy them, and the two have knocked the hate out of each other. Grundy is then taken back to his Earth by the Justice Society.

In his next appearance, Solomon Grundy battles the combined might of both the Justice Society, and later their counterparts the Justice League, nearly to a standstill at Slaughter Swamp, when he develops an affection for a lost alien child who has accidentally been sent to Earth-2 and is dying due to separation from his pet. Having absorbed magic from Doctor Fate and Green Lantern, Grundy is easily able to defeat the combined might of Superman, Flash, Earth-Two Hawkman, Earth-One Hawkman, and Green Lantern, until he is defeated by both Green Lanterns and sealed in Slaughter Swamp. The alien child is finally reunited with his pet and sent back to his own dimension.

While imprisoned, Grundy incorrectly deduces that the second Green Lantern&#x27;s Earth must contain a second Solomon Grundy and crosses over from his Slaughter Swamp prison on Earth-Two to Earth-One where he overpowers that Earth&#x27;s Superman before being tricked and stranded on the moon.

Solomon Grundy briefly works with the Injustice Society when the Fiddler retrieves Grundy from the moon of Earth-One to attack the JSA. The two defeat Hawkman and Wildcat before Grundy is thrown into a cooling volcano by Power Girl and Superman.

Grundy goes on to afflict Green Lantern and his teammates, including the Huntress who is the first female for whom he develops an affection. After Solomon Grundy is rescued from a glacier by Alan Scott&#x27;s daughter, Jade, Grundy becomes loyal to her and, for a while, is an ally of Infinity, Inc. Eventually, this affectionate relationship turns tragic as the villainous Marcie Cooper, a.k.a. Harlequin of the Dummy&#x27;s Injustice Unlimited, uses her illusion powers to disguise herself as Jade. Harlequin manipulates Grundy to attack the members of Infinity Inc., one by one. She convinces him to press the unconscious Mister Bones&#x27; bare hand against Skyman; since Bones&#x27;s skin constantly exudes a cyanide-based compound, this quickly leads to Skyman&#x27;s death. Once Grundy found out that Marcie had duped him, he savagely beat her within an inch of her life. This is the beginning of the end for Infinity Inc., and for Grundy&#x27;s quasi-heroic career.

====Earth-One version&#x27;s history====
When Earth-Two&#x27;s Solomon Grundy visited Earth-One, he left behind some residual cells in the sewers. The Earth-One Solomon Grundy is born when the Parasite uses an enhanced crystal to metabolically hasten the growth of residual cells which becomes a new, much more bestial version. During a clash with Superman, it is determined that his might is too much for the Man of Steel, so Superman flies the monster to an alien world inhospitable to all save the hardiest life as the zombie propels himself through the air, mimicking his one-time adversary.

This version repeatedly plagues Superman for years until during an encounter wherein multiple Grundys are spawned, Superman and the Swamp Thing both encounter the Grundy clones. Soon, Superman obtains a compound from S.T.A.R. Labs which causes the Grundys to become inert, in effect killing the seemingly unkillable man-thing. The Swamp Thing attempts to cry out for Superman to stop as he believes Grundy to meet the definition of life, but the Swamp Thing is unable to express this due to his physical difficulty in speaking. This version of Grundy returns one final time, without explanation, leading a gang in the Earth-One Gotham City. He is apparently destroyed yet again when Batman tricks the creature into a blast furnace, where it is apparently consumed by the flames.

This version of Grundy was retroactively erased from history after the revamping of Superman in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of Solomon Grundy has a similar history to his Earth-Two counterpart and debuts during the &quot;&quot; storyline. Grundy and a newly disfigured Harvey Dent strike up an odd friendship after Dent escapes the slaughterhouse to plot his revenge on Carmine Falcone. Grundy also appears earlier in the story while Batman pursues one of the suspects who bombed Dent&#x27;s house into the sewers during Thanksgiving. Grundy attacks both of them, but Batman drives him off by blinding him with a shot of mace. In the feature-length animated film adaptation of &quot;The Long Halloween&quot; Part One, Batman gently persuades Grundy to cease hostilities toward the bomber and allow Batman to assume custody, removing the undesirable intruder and resuming Grundy&#x27;s status quo of relative tranquility, successfully appealing to Grundy&#x27;s simple desire for peace, quiet and solitude in his humble sewer lair. Later as a somewhat humorous twist, Batman provides Solomon Grundy with a Thanksgiving dinner.

After Infinity, Inc. disbands, Solomon Grundy loses his loyalty towards Jade. A clash with Alan Scott and Jade in the pages of &quot;Green Lantern Corps Quarterly&quot; ends with Grundy turning into a statue of petrified wood. The heroes believe the threat of Grundy to have ended once and for all, but they are mistaken.

Shortly thereafter, Grundy reappears in Gotham in the pages of &quot;&quot;, battling Batman once again and killing the female descendant of one of the killers of Cyrus Gold.

Grundy&#x27;s next major appearance is in &quot;Starman&quot;, lurking in Opal City&#x27;s sewers. Jack Knight befriends Grundy, who has become innocent and childlike. Grundy also becomes friends with previous Starman Mikaal Tomas, and dies while sacrificing himself to save Jack Knight from being crushed by a collapsing building. When Grundy appears again, he has returned to his malicious persona; the joint efforts of Jack Knight, Batman, Alan Scott, and The Floronic Man are needed to stop him.

The origins of Grundy&#x27;s resurrection come from the fact that the Parliament of Trees, a high council of Plant Elementals, tried to turn him into the newest Plant Elemental. However, the process was missing one vital piece: fire, as a Plant Elemental cannot be fully created unless it died in flames. Since Grundy&#x27;s death did not involve fire at all, the process is not complete, and he becomes a sort of half-functional Plant Elemental. Grundy has been seemingly destroyed on several occasions, only to rise from the swamp again in a new incarnation. Each version of Grundy has been somewhat different from the last, depending on the medium used to dispatch him (and the drawing style of the current artist. The original Grundy, for example, had prominent front teeth). Some have been truly evil; some much less so. Some versions are more mindless than others; some are moderately intelligent, recalling the literate, well-spoken monster of Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

Grundy hides out for a time in the Arrowcave, the long-abandoned former headquarters of Green Arrow. While searching for artifacts of his former life, Oliver and his former ward, Roy Harper / Arsenal, stumble onto Grundy&#x27;s new hideout. The story, accurately and humorously entitled &quot;Grundy No Like Arrows in the Face!&quot;, is found in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 3) #18. Green Arrow notes that this version seems much more violent, and manages to kill him by choking him with the string to his broken bow (despite the fact that Grundy does not have a heartbeat, functional veins, or need to breathe). In &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 3) #53, &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Green Arrow helps Dr. Chrissie Cavendish, a S.T.A.R. Labs employee, who claims she is the great-great-granddaughter of the man the monster spawned from, to find and cure him. Her cure warps her into a monster much worse than Grundy. Green Arrow subdues the new monster, and leaves Grundy be. It is not known if Grundy is still using this building.

In the first issue of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Seven Soldiers of Victory&quot;, Issue #0 of the same name, one of the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp recounts the death of the miserly pedophile, Cyrus Gold, killed at the hands of an enraged mob, but also mentions that Gold could just as easily have been the innocent victim of a misunderstanding, as Slaughter Swamp is a point in space where time means nothing. In the final issue, the same Unknown Man punishes another of his group – the Eighth Man, Zor – by dressing him in Cyrus Gold&#x27;s clothing and leaving him for the mob to find, implying that Zor – an extremely vain character, notable for attempting several times to overthrow the Universe and for having defeated The Spectre – would later become the first Solomon Grundy.

Grundy is manipulated by Gorilla Grodd via mind control into attacking Batman and Superman for President Luthor for the bounty of one billion dollars in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;. Batman is able to stop Grundy.

While no specifics are given during the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, Solomon Grundy is also coerced into joining the Secret Society of Super Villains. He participates in the final strike against the Secret Six. Ragdoll II encounters Grundy in a doorway. Ragdoll&#x27;s scarred face relates to Grundy, and Grundy goes on to turn against the Secret Society. The aftermath of that battle is inconclusive, but Grundy evidently survives, as he was last seen in a murky swamp in &quot;JSA Classified&quot;. In it, he is convinced by Icicle to help Wizard, who is in trouble.

After helping Icicle free Johnny Sorrow from Prometheus&#x27; cosmic key, Grundy stays with the newly formed Injustice Society.

Solomon Grundy is seen fighting against the Blood Pack in the Battle of Metropolis, until he is vaporized by Superboy-Prime&#x27;s heat vision, which apparently kills the Blood Pack and destroys Grundy&#x27;s current incarnation.

In Brad Meltzer&#x27;s &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, Grundy is reborn with intelligence after being killed in the Battle of Metropolis. He is revealed to be the mastermind behind the abduction of Red Tornado&#x27;s robot body (it is revealed he gained this intelligence when he was reborn after being burned by Prime). Grundy expresses a desire to stop his cycle of dying and being reborn and so it appears he enlists the help of Professor Ivo to build him an Amazo body to live in forever. The Red Tornado kills Grundy with F5 tornado winds, ripping him apart.

He later appears in the &quot;Salvation Run&quot; mini-series as one of the villains exiled to another planet. He is killed during a battle with Parademons. His body, awaiting its inevitable resurrection, is left behind when the villains leave the Hell Planet. However, when the villains exit, Grundy&#x27;s hand trembles, accompanied with a groaning sound.

In the one-shot &quot;Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy&quot; (March 2009) by Geoff Johns and Scott Kolins, Cyrus Gold returns to life in Slaughter Swamp, as he was prior to becoming Grundy. He returns to Gotham City, but is shot by police after attacking a charity worker. In the police morgue, he transforms into Solomon Grundy. Grundy is once more an unintelligent monster, repeating the opening line of the nursery rhyme. A week later, having retreated to the sewers, he has a fight with Killer Croc. At the end of the fight, exhausted, he reverts to Cyrus Gold again. He finds himself in front of his own grave, where the Phantom Stranger tells him he has seven days to undo his curse, as &quot;There is an unholy night coming, as black as the dead&#x27;s blood. And it&#x27;s best if Solomon Grundy was not around for it&quot; (a reference to the upcoming &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline). Alan Scott serves as his reluctant guide, as the story continues in the &quot;Solomon Grundy&quot; miniseries.

In the countdown to &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Cyrus Gold was given one week to discover the truth of who murdered him, so he could repent for all of his sins and gain absolution. Alan Scott and the Phantom Stranger were given as his guides throughout the week, while Etrigan was trying to take him to Hell. Gold had a habit of getting killed. No matter how much damage was done to his body, he resurrected as a complete Solomon Grundy, driven to kill. Eventually it is revealed that Gold committed suicide, meaning he forced the curse of Solomon Grundy on himself. The end of the series&#x27; run shows Grundy reanimated as a Black Lantern, and Cyrus Gold in hell. Grundy then tracks down and attacks Bizarro, using a past friendship they had to stir up the creature&#x27;s emotions. Bizarro eventually defeats Grundy by flying him into the sun, which completely incinerates him, and the black ring.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
The Prime Earth Solomon Grundy is introduced in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;. His appearance resembles that of his Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; depictions. Solomon Grundy was briefly seen fighting Arkillo of the Sinestro Corps and Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps.

Solomon Grundy is pursued by Batman in Gotham City before the former incapacitates him. Grundy recites the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme while being pursued before Batman finished it for him when he defeats Grundy.

During &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles&quot; arc, Solomon Grundy is among the villains on Joker&#x27;s side in his war against Riddler.

The sorceress Selena created a mindless clone of Solomon Grundy from his DNA sample to serve as the muscle for the Fatal Five and fought Supergirl.

In a flashback, Solomon Grundy is among the villains that protected Ingrid Karlsson during a riot at Arkham Asylum. Before Ingrid was killed by an inmate using a rogue Batarang despite the villains getting her away from the riot, she gave birth to Astrid Arkham who would later become Arkham Knight.

In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, a flashback to 1941 has Doctor Fate and Salem the Witch Girl assisting Mister Miracle of the Justice Society Dark in fighting Solomon Grundy. After he is subdued, Miracle suggests that they go after Bride of Grundy. Huntress leads the Justice Society of America in recruiting Grundy. When Salem tries to revive him to a human form, her curse causes her to reduce Grundy to a skeleton. Grundy assisted the Justice Society of America in fighting the zombies summoned by Gentleman Ghost using a special sphere. When Icicle attacked the sphere and unknowingly unleashed Surtr, Grundy and Huntress reprimanded him.

In the &quot;DC All In&quot; initiative, Solomon Grundy joins Scandal Savage&#x27;s incarnation of the Injustice Society.

==Powers and abilities==
Solomon Grundy has superhuman strength and stamina. His strength is roughly on par with Kryptonians. He is virtually indestructible and immortal thanks to the elemental energy that imbues his form with pseudo-life. He is nearly invulnerable to physical, magical, and energy attacks and he is not affected by fire or low temperatures. He has proven highly resistant to the effects of the original Green Lantern&#x27;s power ring (which is attributed to his part-plant essence; originally because he had absorbed plant matter from the swamp, and later because he was a partial &quot;plant elemental&quot; like Swamp Thing).

Grundy possesses a healing factor. While he has occasionally been destroyed, he has always returned to life sooner or later, though often with different personalities and powers.

Seeking to understand the Pit&#x27;s power, Ra&#x27;s repeatedly murdered Grundy until Wonder City was eventually shut down and Gotham City built over it, with the Iceberg Lounge being built over Grundy&#x27;s prison. After the Penguin finds him, he uses Grundy to kill traitorous underlings and attempt to kill Batman, who eventually defeats Grundy.

<text>Edge Hill railway station is a railway station that serves the district of Edge Hill, Liverpool, England and is one of the oldest railway stations in the world.

There have been two stations of that name. The first stood a short distance south-west of the present station and its remains are still visible, although the site is not open to the public.

Edge Hill is the first station after departure from . The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Northern Trains. Other services by Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains pass through the station, although they are non-stop.

== Early history ==

The first station opened on 15 September 1830 as part of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was located in a wide by long, deep sandstone cutting, with three tunnels at the west end.

==The new station==

As early as May 1831 the directors had concluded that Crown Street station was too far removed from the centre of Liverpool so they commissioned a survey to be made with a view to finding a way of bringing the railway into the town. George Stephenson produced a plan in June 1831 to provide a line, mainly in a tunnel, from Edge Hill to the cattle market at Haymarket. Liverpool Common Council approved the scheme subject to it being restricted to passengers only and plans were drawn up in October 1831 for submission to Parliament. The Bill received Royal Assent on 23 May 1832, tenders were let and work started in 1833.

Parliament had forbidden locomotives to run through tunnels and the railway had therefore to build stationary engines at the top of the incline up from Lime Street. The decision to extend the railway to Lime Street station required the construction of a new station at Edge Hill, situated to the north of the old station so that it was on the new line at the tunnel portal. Plans were approved in December 1834, and a contract for the construction of the new station and engine houses was let in March 1835. The new station was about by in area with stone platforms with all the station buildings set back from the platform edges.

Trains descended to Lime Street by gravity under the control of two brakesmen riding in an open brake waggon, being rope-hauled by a winding engine back up to Edge Hill. This system, constructed by Mather, Dixon and Company under the direction of John Grantham, ended in 1870.

The new Edge Hill station was opened in 1836 and has been in continuous use ever since.

Sidings to the north of the station (sometimes called Exhibition Road after the adjacent thoroughfare leading to the exhibition hall) served as a terminus for excursionists visiting the 1886 &quot;Shipperies&quot; and 1887 Royal Jubilee Exhibitions.

The venue on Edge Lane had its own sidings to the south, including access to the building itself, for delivery of exhibits and removal of materials when the site closed.

== Layout ==
Facing west there are two tunnels visible from the platforms. The northernmost tunnel is the Waterloo Tunnel, and the southern tunnel leads to . The station consists of two island platforms, each with an original building dating from 1836. This makes it one of the world&#x27;s oldest passenger railway station still in use, although the former Liverpool Road station in Manchester is the oldest surviving station building. Art exhibitions are held on the approach road to the Southern island platform. An arts centre called Metal now occupies part of the building on the Manchester-bound platform.

Around 400 yards from the station in the Manchester direction is a key junction, where the Merseytravel City lines separate into two: one goes towards (serving the southern Liverpool-Manchester line and the West Coast Main Line) and the other towards (serving the Wigan and Manchester Victoria lines). The Canada Dock Branch line runs through the station towards Bootle Oriel Road. There is also a carriage servicing depot just to the east of the junction on the line towards Mossley Hill which is used by Alstom to maintain train operator Virgin West Coast&#x27;s Pendolino fleet.

The station buildings are Grade II listed. Network Rail applied for planning permission in November 2016 to update the ticket desk and counter to make it more accessible to passengers with disabilities.

The ticket office (on the northern island platform) is staffed throughout the day (05:30–00:10, Monday–Saturday). Whilst electronic ticket machines are present, in January 2021 customer information screens were installed and commissioned providing customers with train running information for all four platforms (which are linked by a subway). The buildings on platforms 3 and 4 are no longer in use by the railway, but are used by Metal Culture for Art studios. Step-free access is available to platforms 1 and 2 only, as the subway to the other platforms has stairs.

== Services ==
Edge Hill lies on both routes of the Liverpool to Manchester Line from Liverpool Lime Street. On Mondays to Saturdays, there is an hourly service on the northern branch to via and an hourly service on the southern branch to Manchester Oxford Road via Warrington Central, and a half-hourly service to Wigan North Western via St Helens Central, with 4 trains per hour westbound to . There is no Sunday service.

== Points of interest ==
In 2009, arts organisation Metal completed a major renovation of the Engine House, Boiler Room and Accumulator Tower at Edge Hill Station, after successfully raising capital funding from Kensington Regeneration, Merseytravel, Northern Rail, Railway Heritage Trust and Network Rail. This included works by Al and Al, entitled XXX: Get Off At Edge Hill.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* 8 March 1906, shunt horse driver John Short, was injured after wagons being pulled by horses detached, catching him between the horses and the wagons.

<text>Clarence Holmes, better known as Ready Rock C, is an American hip hop record producer, beatboxer, and rapper. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff (Jeffrey Townes), then known as DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince. According to Holmes, he left the group in 1990 because Smith &quot;wanted the spotlight all to himself.&quot;

Holmes sued Smith and Townes in 1999, claiming he was owed one-third of the group&#x27;s profits. The case was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.

<text>Alamannia, or Alemania, was the kingdom established and inhabited by the Alemanni, a Germanic tribal confederation that had broken through the Roman &quot;limes&quot; in 213.

The Alemanni expanded from the Main River basin during the 3rd century and raided Roman provinces and settled on the left bank of the Rhine River from the 4th century.

Ruled by independent tribal kings during the 4th and the 5th centuries, Alamannia lost its independence in the late 5th century and became a duchy of the Frankish Empire in the 6th century. As the Holy Roman Empire started to form under King Conrad I of East Francia (reigning 911 to 918), the territory of Alamannia became the Duchy of Swabia in 915. Scribes often used the term &quot;Suebia&quot; interchangeably with &quot;Alamannia&quot; in the 10th to the 12th centuries.

The territory of Alamannia as it existed from the 7th to 9th centuries centred on Lake Constance and included the High Rhine, the Black Forest and the Alsace on either side of the Upper Rhine, the upper Danube River basin as far as the confluence with the Lech River, with an unclear boundary towards Burgundy to the south-west in the Aare River basin (the Aargau). Raetia Curiensis, although not part of Alemannia, was ruled by Alemannic counts, and became part of the Duchy of Swabia since it was established by Burchard I (Duke of Alemannia from 909 to 911).

The territory corresponds to what is still the area of Alemannic German in the modern period, French Alsace, German Baden and Swabia, German-speaking Switzerland and the Austrian Vorarlberg.

In the area of present-day Switzerland, the Alemannic territory expanded during the High Middle Ages, with the Walser migration into the Alps, with the Zähringer and later the influence of Bern towards Upper Burgundy, and into Grisons as lower Raetia came under the rule of the Werdenberg counts.

==Geography==

The Alamanni were pushed south from their original area of settlement in the Main basin and in the 5th and 6th century settled new territory on either side of the Rhine. 
Alemannia, under Frankish rule (later the Duchy of Swabia) within the Holy Roman Empire, covered a territory that was more or less undisputed during the 7th to 13th centuries, organised into counties or &quot;pagi&quot;.

In Swabia: 
&quot;Hegowe&quot; (Hegau), between Lake Constance, the upper Danube and the Swabian Jura. &quot;Perahtoltaspara&quot; (Berchtoldsbaar) in the upper Neckar basin, left of the upper Danube as far as Ulm, including the source of the Danube. &quot;Nekargowe&quot; (named for the Neckar, capital Canstatt). 
&quot;Swiggerstal&quot; (the modern Ermstal), &quot;Filiwigawe&quot; (Filsgau, named for the Fils), &quot;Trachgowe&quot; (Drachgau, near Schwäbisch Gmünd) and &quot;Alba&quot; (Albuch) between the Neckar and the Danube. &quot;Duria&quot; (Duriagau) between Ulm and Augsburg.

&quot;Albegowe&quot; (Allgäu), &quot;Keltinstein&quot; (between Geltnach and Wertach) and &quot;Augestigowe&quot; (capital Augsburg) along the Lech forming the border to Bavaria. &quot;Rezia&quot; (Ries, ultimately from the name of the Roman province of &quot;Raetia&quot;) in the Northeastern corner, left of the Danube (capital Nördlingen). &quot;Linzgowe&quot; (Linzgau) and &quot;Argungowe&quot; (named for Argen River) north of Lake Constance. &quot;Eritgau&quot;, &quot;Folcholtespara&quot; (Folcholtsbaar), &quot;Rammegowe&quot; (Rammachgau) and &quot;Illargowe&quot; (named for the Iller, capital Memmingen) on the right side of the Danube.

In Baden: &quot;Brisigowe&quot; (Breisgau) along the Upper Rhine opposite Sundgau, and &quot;Mortunova&quot;, the later Ortenau, along the Upper Rhine opposite Nordgau. &quot;Alpegowe&quot; (Albgau), centered on St. Blaise Abbey, Black Forest.

In modern France (the Alsace): &quot;Suntgowe&quot; (Sundgau) and &quot;Nordgowe&quot; (Nordgau).

In modern Switzerland: &quot;Augestigowe&quot; (the territory surrounding Augst) and &quot;Turgowe&quot; (modern Thurgau, named for the Thur; Zürichgau was detached from Thurgau in the 8th century).

The territory between Alamannia and Upper Burgundy was known as &quot;Argowe&quot; (modern Aargau, named for the Aare). The pertinence of this territory to either Alamannia or Upper Burgundy was disputed.

The county of Raetia Curiensis was absorbed into Alamannia in the early 10th century. It comprised the &quot;Ringowe&quot; (Rheingau, named for the Rhine) and &quot;Retia&quot; proper.

==History==

===Tribal kingdoms===

Originally a loose confederation of unrelated tribes, the Alemanni underwent coalescence or ethnogenesis during the 3rd century, and were ruled by kings throughout the 4th and 5th centuries until 496, when they were defeated by Clovis I of the Franks at the Battle of Tolbiac.

The Alemanni during the Roman Empire period were divided into a number of cantons or &quot;goviae&quot;, each presided by a tribal king. But there appears to have been the custom of the individual kings uniting under the leadership of a single king in military expeditions.
Some kings of the Alemanni of the 4th and 5th centuries are known by name, the first being Chrocus (died 306), a military leader who organized raids across the limes during the 3rd century.
Chnodomarius (fl. 350) supported Constantius II in the rebellion of Magnentius.
Chnodomarius was the leader of the Alemannic army in the battle of Strasbourg in 357.

Macrian, Hariobaudes, Urius, Ursicinus, Vadomarius, and Vestralpus were Alemannic kings who in 359 made treaties with Julian the Apostate. Macrian was deposed in an expedition ordered by Valentinian I in 370. Macrian appears to have been involved in building a large alliance of Alemannic tribes against Rome, which earned him the title of &quot;turbarum rex artifex&quot; (&quot;king and crafter of unrest&quot;).

The Romans installed Fraomar as a successor of Marcian, but the Bucinobantes would not accept him and he was expelled and Macrian restored and Valentinian made the Bucinobantes his &quot;foederati&quot; in the war against the Franks. Macrian was killed on campaign against the Franks, in an ambush laid by the Frankish king Mallobaudes.

Gibuld (fl. 470) is the last known king of the Alemanni. His raid on Passau is mentioned in the &quot;vita&quot; of Saint Lupus. The name of Gibuld&#x27;s successor who was defeated at Tolbiac is not known.

===Merovingian duchy===
After their defeat in 496, the Alemanni bucked the Frankish yoke and put themselves under the protection of Theodoric the Great of the Ostrogoths but after his death they were again subjugated by the Franks under Theudebert I in 536. Thereafter, Alamannia was a nominal dukedom within Francia.

Though ruled by their own dukes, it is not likely that they were very often united under one duke in the 6th and 7th centuries. The Alemanni most frequently appear as auxiliaries in expeditions to Italy. The Duchy of Alsace was Alemannic, but it was ruled by a line of Frankish dukes and the region around the upper Danube and Neckar rivers was ruled by the Ahalolfing family and not by the ducal house which ruled central Alamannia around Lake Constance. Rhaetia too, though Alamannic, was ruled by the Victorids coterminously with the Diocese of Chur.

Alamannia was Christianised during the 7th century, although not as thoroughly as either Francia to its west or Bavaria to its east. The first Alamannic law code, &quot;Pactus Alamannorum&quot;, dates to this period. The Roman dioceses of Strasbourg and Basel covered Alsace and that of Chur, as mentioned, Rhaetia. Alamannia itself had a diocese only in the east, at Augsburg (early 7th century). There were two Roman bishoprics, Windisch and Octodurum, which were moved early to other sites (Avenches and Sitten respectively).

Western Alamannia did eventually (7th century) receive a diocese (Constance) through the cooperation of the bishops of Chur and the Merovingian monarchs. The foundation of Constance is obscure, though it was the largest diocese in Germany throughout the Merovingian and early Carolingian era. The dioceses of Alamannia, including Chur, which had been a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Milan, were placed under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Mainz by the Carolingians.

After the death of Dagobert I in 638, Alamannia, like Bavaria, Aquitaine, and Brittany, broke its ties with its Frankish sovereigns and struggled for independence. This was largely successful until the early 8th century, when a series of campaigns waged by the Arnulfing mayors of the palace reduced Alamannia to a province of Francia once again.
It was, however, during this period of &quot;de facto&quot; independence that the Alamanni began to be ruled by one duke, though Alsace and Rhaetia remained outside of the scope of Alamannia.

Between 709 and 712, Pepin of Heristal fought against Lantfrid, who appears as &quot;dux&quot; of the Alamanni, and who committed to writing the second Alamannic law code, the &quot;Lex Alamannorum&quot;. In 743, Pepin the Short and Carloman waged a campaign to reduce Alamannia and in 746 Carloman began a final thrust to subdue the Alamannic nobility. Several thousand Alamanni noblemen were summarily arrested, tried, and executed for treason at a Council at Cannstatt.

===Carolingian rule===

During the reign of Louis the Pious, there were tendencies to renewed independence in Alamannia, and the 830s were marked by bloody feuds between the Alamannic and Rhaetian nobility vying for dominion over the area. Following the Treaty of Verdun of 843, Alamannia became a province of East Francia, the kingdom of Louis the German, the precursor of the Kingdom of Germany. It was called a &quot;regnum&quot; in contemporary sources, though this does not necessarily mean that it was a kingdom or subkingdom. At times, however, it was.

It was granted to Charles the Bald in 829, though it is not certain whether he was recognised as duke or king. It was certainly a kingdom, including Alsace and Rhaetia, when it was granted to Charles the Fat in the division of East Francia in 876. Under Charles, Alamannia became the centre of the Empire, but after his deposition, it found itself out of favour. Though ethnically singular, it was still plagued by Rhaetian-Alamannic feuds and fighting over the control of the Alamannic church.

Alamannia in the late 9th century, like Bavaria, Saxony, and Franconia, sought to unite itself under one duke, but it had considerably less success than either Saxony or Bavaria. Alamannia was one of the &quot;jüngeres Stammesherzogtum&quot;, one of the &quot;younger&quot; stem duchies, or tribal duchies, which formed the basis of the political organisation of East Francia after the collapse of the Carolingian dynasty in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.

In the 10th century, no noble house of Alamannia succeeded in founding a ducal dynasty, as the Ottonians did in Saxony or the Liutpolding in Bavaria, though the Hunfridings came closest.

The duchy encompassed the area surrounding Lake Constance, the Black Forest, and the left and right banks of the Rhine, including Alsace and parts of the Swiss plateau, bordering on Upper Burgundy. The boundary with Burgundy, fixed in 843, ran along the lower Aare, turning towards the south at the Rhine, passing west of Lucerne and across the Alps along the upper Rhône to the Saint Gotthard Pass. In the north, the boundary ran from the Murg (some 30 km south of Karlsruhe) to Heilbronn and the Nördlinger Ries. The eastern boundary was at the Lech. Argovia was disputed territory between the dukes of Alamannia and Burgundy.

Burchard II, son of the late Burchard I and count in Raetia Curiensis, took the title of duke of Swabia, Duke acknowledged by the newly elected king Henry the Fowler in 919. The duchy of Swabia was ruled by the Hohenstaufen during 1079–1268 and was disestablished with the execution of Conradin and its territory was politically fragmented during the succeeding interregnum period.

==Legacy==

Alemannic German persists as a separate family of dialects within High German.
The distribution of the Low Alemannic and High Alemannic subgroups largely correspond to the extent of historical Alemannia, while the Highest Alemannic dialects spread beyond its limits during the High Middle Ages. The Brünig-Napf-Reuss line is a cultural boundary within High Alemannic which marks the division of Alemannia proper and the Argovia marches between Alemannia and Burgundy.

The names for Germany in modern Arabic (), Catalan (&quot;Alemanya&quot;), Welsh (&quot;Yr Almaen&quot;), Cornish (&quot;Almayn&quot;), French (&quot;Allemagne&quot;), Persian (&quot;ألمان&quot;), Galician-Portuguese (&quot;Alemanha&quot;), Spanish (&quot;Alemania&quot;), and Turkish (&quot;Almanya&quot;) all derive from Alamannia. A similar correspondence exists for &quot;German&quot;, both as the language and the adjectival form of &quot;Germany&quot;.

==List of rulers of Alamannia==
===Independent kings===

The following are the known names of early Alemannic kings. They did not necessarily rule all of Alamannia, but were more likely petty kings ruling over smaller tribes or cantons, e.g. Macrian (fl. 370), king of the Alamannic tribe of the Bucinobantes.

===Carolingians===
The Alemanni were under direct Carolingian rule during 746 (Council of Cannstatt) to 892.
Intermittently, junior members of the Carolingian dynasties were appointed &quot;regulus&quot; or &quot;subregulus&quot; of Alemannia while at other times, 
Alemannia was under the direct administration of the Carolingian kings (after 843 kings of East Francia).
* Childeric III (King of the Franks 743–751)
** Carloman 744–747
** Drogo 747–748
* Pepin the Short 748–768 (King of the Franks 751–768)
* Carloman I (King of the Franks 768–771)
* Charlemagne (King of the Franks 768–814)
** Hnabi Ahalolfing, grandson of Gotfrid, is mentioned as an Alamannic duke during the reign of Charlemagne

** Bernard 888–892
* Louis the Child (King of East Francia 889–911)
** Burchard I Hunfriding 909–911
From the later 8th century, Alemannic dynasties were able to establish themselves once again.
Variously called counts, or margraves, or dukes, these native dynasties during the later years of Carolingian rule managed to establish themselves as de facto independent, establishing the &quot;younger stem duchy&quot; of Alemannia/Swabia by the early 10th century.
The rivalry between the Hunfridings and Ahalolfings was decided in favour of Burchard II Hunfriding in the Battle of Winterthur of 919.

<text>The Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) () is a rapid transit and commuter rail company owned by the São Paulo State Department for Metropolitan Transports. It was created on 28 May 1992, from several railroads that already existed in Greater São Paulo, Brazil.

Part of the Greater São Paulo rail system, the CPTM has 57 stations in five lines, with a total length of . The system carries about 2 million passengers a day. On 7 December 2018, CPTM set a weekday ridership record with 3,221,035 trips.

==History==
Most of railways now run by the CPTM were built between 1860 and 1957 by the São Paulo Railway (the lines 7 and 10), Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana (the lines 8 and 9) and Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil (lines 11 and 12). These railways were eventually incorporated into the state-owned Rede Ferroviária Federal (RFFSA) in 1957 and Ferrovia Paulista S.A. (FEPASA) 1971. Finally, in 1992 the urban sections of RFFSA and FEPASA merged, forming the CPTM.

Between the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s, the CPTM began the conversion of some metropolitan lines to provide a service similar to rapid transit and better integrate with the São Paulo Metro. Most of the stations where either rebuilt or modernized and new trains were purchased allowing the headway of lines to be as low as four minutes in some lines. This experience started in the Line E in the year 2000, in the stretch known as &quot;East Express&quot;, serving the east end of São Paulo City and running parallel to the Line 3 - Red.

The proposed Trens Intercidades regional railway project is considering using the Line 7 tracks for providing service to neighboring cities of Jundiaí, Campinas and Americana.

In 2018, the CPTM opened the Line 13, the first line completely built and operated by the company. This line connects the Line 12 to the São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, with a special Express service connecting it to the central Luz station, and another service connecting it to the Brás station, both only operating on a specific schedule.

==Operation==
The CPTM operates five lines in the Greater São Paulo area, identified by number and color. Most of these lines run on existing surface tracks that continue out of Greater São Paulo as MRS Logística intercity freight lines and share right of way with freight trains. The more lightly used outer sections of several lines have level crossings.

Service starts every day at 4 AM, when trains depart from each terminus, until the last train leaves at midnight. On Saturdays operation is extended until 1 AM.

The company charges a flat fare that can be paid either by magnetic ticket sold in the stations or with a rechargeable smartcard, and grants access to any of the rail lines on the Greater São Paulo, including lines operated by the São Paulo Metro.

<doc id="1055714" wikidata="Q910487" url="?curid=1055714" title="Come as You Are (Nirvana song)">
<text>&quot;Come as You Are&quot; is a song by American rock band Nirvana, written by frontman and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It is the third track and the second single from the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the single released in March 1992. It was the band&#x27;s second and final American top 40 hit, reaching number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and second UK top 10 hit, reaching number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The single reached the top 10 in eight countries and the top 40 in eleven further countries.

The unexpected success of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; drew Nirvana to mainstream success, with &quot;Nevermind&quot; being released two weeks after the single&#x27;s release. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band and its management company debated whether to release &quot;Come as You Are&quot; or &quot;In Bloom&quot; as the next single from the album due to Cobain&#x27;s concerns over similarity of the former with Killing Joke song &quot;Eighties&quot; (1984). After some persuasion by the management company, Cobain agreed to release &quot;Come as You Are&quot; as the second single because of its commercial potential. Killing Joke were upset over the song, and there were rumors that a lawsuit had been filed over the song, though the suit never materialized. Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker was said to be upset about the whole situation, and he felt that Nirvana handled the matter poorly. Similarities between &quot;Come as You Are&quot; and &quot;Life Goes On&quot; by the Damned have also been noted.

The music video for &quot;Come as You Are&quot; was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who drew inspiration for it from the cover artwork of &quot;Nevermind&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Come as You Are&quot; 445th on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and it placed 452nd on the 2010 edition of the list.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Come as You Are&quot; was one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto the rehearsal tape the group sent to producer Butch Vig prior to the recording of &quot;Nevermind&quot; in 1991. The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, in early 1991. Cobain recorded his guitar solo in two takes, as well as three takes of vocals, of which the first was used. Vig then asked Cobain to double track his vocals throughout the entire song. During the harmony overdub session, Cobain accidentally sang the phrase &quot;And I don&#x27;t have a gun&quot; too early, appearing the fourth time he sings the word &quot;memoria&quot; after the guitar solo. When this mistake was discovered, Cobain decided to keep it in the final recording. Vig sampled Cobain singing &quot;memoria&quot; from the middle of the song and placed it in the background of the song near the end twice. The band also performed an acoustic version of the song on MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993. The recording later appeared on &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; in November 1994.

==Composition and lyrics==
&quot;Come as You Are&quot; is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of three minutes and thirty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a heavy rock tempo of 120 beats per minute. &quot;Come as You Are&quot; is composed in the key of E minor, while Kurt Cobain&#x27;s vocal range spans one octave and one note, from a low of E3 to a high of F4. The song alternates between the chords of E5 and D5 during the verses and Esus4 and G in the pre-chorus, while at the refrain it changes to the chord progression of A–C5. It begins with Cobain playing an unaccompanied guitar riff for eight seconds. Cobain used an Electro-Harmonix Small Clone guitar chorus pedal to give his instrument a &quot;watery&quot; or &quot;echoey&quot; tone during the verses and pre-choruses and as a result of which, the pedal has been associated with the song ever since. He is joined by the rest of the band for the first verse, which is moody and subdued. Once the band reaches the chorus, the song reaches full volume. The shift in dynamics is a technique Nirvana used on many of its songs. The song features one of Cobain&#x27;s longest guitar solos. &quot;Kurt really did not play a lot of solos,&quot; Vig said. &quot;This one is more of a melodic part based on the vocal melody. It&#x27;s not trying to show off pyrotechnics. It complements the melody of the song.&quot;
Many have speculated the song to be about heroin, which Cobain was struggling with at the time of writing and recording. The lyrics &quot;Come 
doused in mud, soaked in bleach&quot; speak directly to a Seattle-area HIV prevention campaign from the time period encouraging addicts to sterilize their needles with bleach before using them with the tagline &quot;If doused in mud, soak in bleach&quot;, and &quot;As a friend, as a trend, as a known enemy&quot;, for some, was further allegory of addiction to the drug. After Cobain&#x27;s death, Sub Pop records approached G. Alan Marlatt at the University of Washington to set up a memorial fund to establish an addiction treatment center titled the &quot;Come as You Are&quot; center, but the funding fell through after the record label was sold to Warner Music Group.

Cobain described the lyrics of &quot;Come as You Are&quot; as contradictory, and said the song was about &quot;people and what they&#x27;re expected to act like.&quot; Pointing to the line &quot;Take your time, hurry up, choice is yours, don&#x27;t be late,&quot; essayist Catherine J. Creswell writes that in Cobain&#x27;s lyrics, clump into strings of empty clichés whose own ostensible meaning is forced into contradictions or simple rhyme sound.&quot;

In light of Cobain&#x27;s suicide in 1994, AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming suggests that hearing &quot;Cobain sing &#x27;and I swear that I don&#x27;t have a gun&#x27; gives &#x27;Come as You Are&#x27; an edge it was never meant to have when [&quot;Nevermind&quot;] was first released in 1991.&quot; Deming reasons that the &quot;I don&#x27;t have a gun&quot; lyric is Cobain&#x27;s &quot;attempt to reassure listeners that ... his target is the world at large rather than the individuals in it, and that there was still room in this damaged world for everyone.&quot; Others have suggested the lyrics regarding the &quot;gun&quot; are metaphors for escapism and turmoil found in heroin usage.

==Release==
Wary of the similarity between the main riff of &quot;Come as You Are&quot; and English post-punk band Killing Joke&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Eighties&quot;, Nirvana and its management were unsure about releasing the song as the second single from &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Danny Goldberg, head of Nirvana&#x27;s management Gold Mountain, later revealed that &quot;[w]e couldn&#x27;t decide between &#x27;Come as You Are&#x27; and &#x27;In Bloom.&#x27; Kurt was nervous about &#x27;Come as You Are&#x27; because it was too similar to a Killing Joke song but we all thought it was still the better song to go with. And, he was right, Killing Joke later did complain about it.&quot; Nirvana biographer Everett True writes that &quot;Come as You Are&quot; was eventually chosen for release as a single because &quot;Goldberg favoured the more obviously commercial song&quot;.

It was anticipated that the first single from &quot;Nevermind&quot;, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, would be a &quot;base-building alternative cut&quot;, while &quot;Come as You Are&quot; would be able to cross over into other radio formats. However, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; became a surprise hit and boosted the band&#x27;s popularity, whereas &quot;Come as You Are&quot; served to maintain it. After its release as a single in March 1992, &quot;Come as You Are&quot; peaked at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single stayed on the chart for 18 weeks. The song also reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks charts. The single also broke the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the ninth spot, where it was also the week&#x27;s highest new entry. In Israel, it was voted in at number 3 on the IBA&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Israel&quot; singles chart. This song ranked number 82 in &quot;Blender&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;, and 452nd on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2019, the song was placed at number 17 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.

Although members of Killing Joke claimed the main guitar riff of &quot;Come as You Are&quot; plagiarized the riff of &quot;Eighties&quot;, the band reportedly did not file a copyright infringement lawsuit, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine attributes to &quot;personal and financial reasons&quot;. However, conflicting reports state that Killing Joke did file a lawsuit but that it was either thrown out of court, or that it was dropped following Cobain&#x27;s death. Geordie Walker, Killing Joke&#x27;s guitar player, said that the band was &quot;very pissed off about that, but it&#x27;s obvious to everyone. We had two separate musicologists&#x27; reports saying it was. Our publisher sent their publisher a letter saying it was and they went &#x27;Boo, never heard of ya!&#x27;, but the hysterical thing about Nirvana saying they&#x27;d never heard of us was that they&#x27;d already sent us a Christmas card!&quot;

Later it was also noted that a third song, the Damned&#x27;s &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, pre-dated both and contained a similar riff to both songs.

In 1999, &quot;Come as You Are&quot; was voted in at number 49 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Rock Tracks Ever!&quot;. As of April 2016, according to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, &quot;Come as You Are&quot; was the sixth most streamed song from the 1990s on Spotify. According to Nielsen Music&#x27;s year-end report for 2019, &quot;Come as You Are&quot; was the third most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 134,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who later directed the videos for &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;In Bloom&quot;, and &quot;Sliver&quot;, as well as Pantera&#x27;s music video for &quot;This Love&quot;. After the unsatisfactory experience filming the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; video with Samuel Bayer, Cobain selected Kerslake due to his impressionistic style. Cobain was unable to formulate any ideas beyond homaging the &quot;Nevermind&quot; album cover and including &quot;a lot of purples and reds&quot;, so he let Kerslake conceptualize the video. Filming took place between January 16-20, 1992. The band shot outdoor footage in Wattles Park in Hollywood Hills a few days prior to the main video shoot. This took place in an Air National Guard hanger at Van Nuys Airport. Kerslake projected this footage in the background of many shots in the main part of the video.

The video features the band in a dark room, where the appearance of falling water in front of the band distorts and blurs the band members&#x27; forms (an idea suggested by Cobain). Throughout the video, clips such as cells multiplying at an incredible rate and an unborn organism in its embryonic stages are shown. The video also features Kurt Cobain swinging violently on a chandelier as water begins to flow into the room as well as a dog wearing a cone collar trying to go down stairs, a baby swimming underwater (a reference to the cover of &quot;Nevermind&quot;), and a pistol sinking. Towards the end, a clip of the band appears, with Cobain in the front, lying on the ground and kissing the camera.

The music video was placed into heavy rotation on MTV in the US. It was placed into the Buzz Bin on MTV Europe, before being placed into active and heavy rotation. It was also played on MTV Australia, &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Video Smash Hits&quot; in Australia.

In his biography, The Storyteller, Grohl wrote that he can no longer watch the video because it reminds him what a bad state that Cobain was in at the time due to his heroin abuse.

==Legacy==
In 2005, a sign was put up in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain&#x27;s hometown, that reads &quot;Welcome to Aberdeen: Come As You Are&quot; as a tribute to Cobain. The sign was paid for and created by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee, a non-profit organization created in May 2004 to honor Cobain. Founded by author Jeff Burlingame and Aberdeen City Councilman Paul Fritts, the committee also plans to create a Kurt Cobain Memorial Park and a youth center in Aberdeen.

The song appears in two scenes of &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot;, a 2008 film starring Ryan Reynolds, and is a thematic element.

The 2016 film &quot;As You Are&quot; was named after the Nirvana track. The plot &quot;revolves around a trio of high schoolers in the 1990s, trying to find their way through the difficult maze of adolescence.&quot;

A cover of the song, performed by Civil Twilight, appears in the end scene of the &quot;Defiance&quot; episode &quot;Down in the Ground Where the Dead Men Go&quot;. Elvis impersonator Jim &quot;The King&quot; Brown also covered the song on his 1998 album &quot;Gravelands&quot;.

A remix of the song was used for trailers of Marvel&#x27;s 2017 Netflix series &quot;The Defenders&quot;.
It also made an appearance in the 2019 film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, and subsequently peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock Songs chart with a 267 percent increase to 2000 downloads sold and a 30 percent increase to 2.8 million US streams in week ending March 14, 2019.

The song &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song&quot; by Blink-182 references &quot;Come as You Are.&quot; &quot;Come as You Are&quot; features the lyrics, &quot;Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don&#x27;t be late,&quot; while &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song,&quot; in turn, features the lyrics, &quot;I took my time, I hurried up, the choice was mine, I didn&#x27;t think enough.&quot;

The song was also featured in the closing credits of the Season 2 finale of the Apple TV+ alternative history series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;.

&quot;Come As You Are (House Mix)&quot; is an electronic tribute with trumpeter Maurice &quot;Mobetta&quot; Brown and house music DJ Chip E. from &quot;Nirvana Reimagined as House and Techno&quot; by producers Jonathan Hay and Cain McKnight.

The song was used in the Luca Guadagnino film Queer, during the introduction of the character Eugene Allerton (played by Drew Starkey).

<text>Legends of the Lost and Found: New Greatest Stories Live is the second live album by the American singer/songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). It featured ten new songs plus live versions of six tracks from recent albums. The album was not released on CD until 2005 when the Chapin family acquired the rights to the music. The new version was remixed from the original multitrack recordings by Harry&#x27;s son Josh (executive producer) and Chapin Foundation board member and archivist Jason Dermer (producer/engineer). While making every attempt to stay true to the original version&#x27;s sound as mixed by Steve Chapin, the new release features a revised track order that better follows the progression and feel of a Harry Chapin concert from that time period, as well as vocals that, through modern technique, rely less on the overdubs that were used in the original.

<doc id="1055725" wikidata="Q935455" url="?curid=1055725" title="SEAT Altea">
<text>The SEAT Altea is an automobile produced by the Spanish automaker SEAT from 2004 to 2015 being previewed by the Salsa Emoción concept. As a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), the car was designed by the Italian Walter de Silva, and was launched in March 2004, as the first example of SEAT&#x27;s new corporate look. The third generation Toledo was identical, except for the addition of a larger boot similar to the one in the Renault Vel Satis. It was launched at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show.

Another extended version, the Altea XL, is also available (having been first presented at the 2006 Paris Motor Show). In 2007, the Altea Freetrack, with four-wheel drive and higher suspension, was released.

On 21 August 2015, SEAT announced that the Altea and Altea XL had been discontinued. Although no direct replacement for the Altea was planned, SEAT is following the global shift from MPVs to SUVs, by launching its own SUV model based on the SEAT León. In February 2016, the Ateca was launched, which was the successor to the Altea according to CEO Luca de Meo: &quot;For us, the Ateca is the replacement of the Altea.&quot;

==Overview==
The Altea was released a few years after many of its competitors arriving on the scene, but it was expected to sell well. However, it exceeded expectations, and 31,223 Alteas were sold within the first year. It is a family oriented five seater, which attempts to portray a more sporty image than most of its rivals. The car is based on Volkswagen Group&#x27;s A5 (PQ35) platform.

An unusual design feature is the &#x27;vertical parked&#x27; windscreen wipers, which are designed to improve pedestrian safety. They disappear in to the window surround either side of the screen. The effect is a completely cleanly swept windscreen, but does mean the &#x27;A pillars&#x27; are rather wide and cause a blind spot.

There were six trim levels: Essence, Reference, Reference Sport, Stylance, Sport (no longer available in the United Kingdom) and FR. Internal combustion engines are available, with the range topping 2.0 FR Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) delivering , available since April 2006.

There are five gearboxes available (depending on market and engine); five or six speed manual, five speed tiptronic automatic, and six or seven speed Direct-Shift Gearbox. It is named after the Spanish city of Altea.

==Safety==
The SEAT Altea was tested in 2004, for its safety performance under the assessment scheme Euro NCAP, and it achieved an overall rating of five stars:
*Adult occupant 
*Child occupant 
*Pedestrian 

==Awards==
*&quot;Red Dot: Best of The Best&quot; Design Award, from the Nordrhein-Westfalen (Germany) Design Centre 
*&#x27;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Automobile 2004&#x27;, in Milan
*&#x27;Autonis&#x27; Design Award, by the &quot;Auto-Strassenverkehr&quot; and &quot;MOT&quot; magazines
*&#x27;Best Concept Car in 2003&#x27;, by the Designers (Europe) organisation (for the SEAT Altea Prototipo) 
*&#x27;Towncar of the Year&#x27; Award, by the Caravan Club, in collaboration with the English magazine &quot;What Car?&quot;
*&#x27;Auto Trophy&#x27; 2004 and 2005, by the German car magazine &quot;Autozeitung&quot;

The SEAT Altea XL is an longer variant of the normal SEAT Altea, a five door five seat compact multi purpose vehicle (MPV), with increased luggage capacity compared to the standard Altea. It was launched at the Paris Motor Show in September 2006. Sales commenced in November 2006.

The SEAT Altea Freetrack is dimensionally similar to the Altea XL, but is designed as compact sport-utility vehicle (SUV). It features raised suspension for increased ground clearance and larger plastic bumpers, and plastic wheel arch and sill extensions, which all increase its exterior dimensions.

All versions of the Freetrack, except the 2.0 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) 2WD, are equipped with a Haldex Traction based on demand four-wheel drive (4WD). The 4WD versions are also called Seat Altea 4. In Mexico and Russia, the SEAT Altea Freetrack is marketed simply as the SEAT &quot;Freetrack&quot;.

Although the Freetrack is available with 4WD, it is not marketed by SEAT as an &quot;SUV&quot;. However, the Freetrack could be seen as a competitor for small SUVs from other marques. The possible internal combustion engine choices are almost the same as for the normal Altea. When launched, it was available in a very uncommon intense yellow. This colour was also seen on models in several promotional brochures - however the colour scheme went out of production by August 2010.

<text>Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí was a gauge railway line in São Paulo, Brazil.

On 13 September 1946, the São Paulo Railway was nationalised by the federal government, and passed to be managed by the Brazilian Ministry of Transportation and Public Works (). In 1948 it was renamed and in 1957 became part of (RFFSA). It was incorporated by RFFSA in 1969.

In the 1970s, the haulage system was replaced by a three blade abt system which was installed by the Japanese firm Marubeni. The locomotives for this changeover had been constructed by Hitachi.
New locomotives (7) were ordered in 2010 from the Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail. The rack-and-pinion locomotives are supposed to be the most powerful ever built, with over 5000 kW of power they develop 760 kN of tractive force. The first unit is already undergoing testing as of June 2012. The first two units should be shipped of to Brazil by fall in order to undergo testing on the track before the end of the year.

<text>Namaqualand (Khoikhoi: &quot;Nama-kwa&quot; meaning Nama Khoi people&#x27;s land) is an arid region of Namibia and South Africa, extending along the west coast over and covering a total area of . It is divided by the lower course of the Orange River into two portions – Little Namaqualand to the south and Great Namaqualand to the north.

Little Namaqualand is within the Namakwa District Municipality, forming part of Northern Cape Province, South Africa. It is geographically the largest district in the country, spanning over 26,836 km2. A typical municipality is Kamiesberg Local Municipality. The semidesert Succulent Karoo region experiences hot summers, sparse rainfall, and cold winters.

Great Namaqualand, in the Karas Region of Namibia, is sparsely populated by the Nama, a Khoikhoi people who have traditionally inhabited the Namaqualand region.

==Tourism==

The area’s landscape ranges from an unexploited coastal strip in the west to semidesert areas in the north-east. Famed for its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, its wild flowers during spring, its wealth of minerals, and cultural history, Namaqualand is a popular region for international and local tourists. The Namakwa coastline and the banks of the Orange River are popular for their hiking trails and off-roading routes.

The beginning of the flower season varies from year to year, but usually occurs between August and October. The natural landscape is continually monitored with the first sign of spring and flower season being the arrival of Namakwa daisies. When purple vygies bloom, spring is coming to an end.

The Namaqua National Park is situated west of the N7, one of South Africa&#x27;s national roads. This conservation area is a great biodiversity hotspot, with the highest concentration of succulent plants of any of the world&#x27;s arid regions. More than a thousand of its estimated 3500 floral species cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

The Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park, on the border of Namibia and South Africa, was known as the Richtersveld National Park in South Africa and the Ai-Ais Hot Springs Game Park in Namibia before the two parks were formally combined in August 2003. What was once the Richtersveld National Park nurtures about 30% of South Africa’s succulent species.

==Modern settlements in the river area==
Some of the more prominent towns in this area are Springbok, being the largest in the region, and Kleinzee and Koiingnaas, both private mining towns owned by De Beers Diamond Mines. This area is quite rich in alluvial diamonds deposited along the coast by the Orange River. Oranjemund is another mining town along this coast, situated in Namibia, but very much on the border. As the name suggests, it is at the mouth of the Orange River, which forms the border between South Africa and Namibia. 

The town of Alexander Bay is located away opposite the river on the South African side and is linked to Oranjemund by the Ernest Oppenheimer Bridge. Other links crossing the river further upstream are a reintroduced pontoon at Sendelingsdrift in the Richtersveld National Park, and road bridges at Vioolsdrif (the main border crossing between the two countries) and at the remote border crossing of Onseepkans.

A vibrant fishing industry is found along this stretch of the South African west coast, especially in Port Nolloth, the major resort town of Namaqualand, and Hondeklipbaai, or Dogstonebay, called such because of a large boulder outside the town, which when viewed correctly, looks vaguely like a dog sitting down. 

Since the 19th century, copper has been mined at Springbok and its surrounding towns such as Okiep, while a large mine extracting copper, lead, zinc, and silver is located at Aggeneys, further inland.

==People==

The region is known for its cultural history, which was preserved by the Nama and Khoisan tribes. The Nama people are a group of Khoikhoi people. Around 50% of the Nama population and 80% of the neighboring Herero population were brutally killed by the German Empire between 1904 and 1907 in a racial extermination during the Herero and Nama genocide. Nama people traditionally speak the Khoekhoe language.

<text>Anuchin is a lunar impact crater that lies on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It is located to the south of the larger crater Lamb, and to the north-northwest of Kugler.

The rim of Anuchin remains relatively sharply defined, although it has been subject to wear due to subsequent impacts. The satellite crater Anuchin L lies astride the southern rim, but the otherwise the outer wall is not significantly incised. The interior floor is nearly featureless, with no central peak at the midpoint and only a few tiny craterlets. But it does not possess the darker hue of a crater interior that has been resurfaced by lava flows.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Anuchin.

<text>The Willamette National Forest is a National Forest located in the central portion of the Cascade Range of the U.S. state of Oregon.
It comprises . Over 380,000 acres (694 mi2, 1,540 km2) are designated wilderness which include seven major mountain peaks. There are also several National Wild and Scenic Rivers within the forest. The forest is named for the Willamette River, which has its headwaters in the forest. The forest&#x27;s headquarters are located in the city of Springfield. There are local ranger district offices in McKenzie Bridge, Detroit, Sweet Home, and Westfir.

The forest stretches for over 100 miles (160 km) along the western slopes of the Cascades in Western Oregon. It extends from the Mount Jefferson area east of Salem to the Calapooya Ridge which divides the watersheds of the Willamette and Umpqua rivers. About 61% of the forest is located in Lane County, but there are large areas in Linn, Marion, and Douglas counties, as well as much smaller areas in Clackamas and Jefferson counties.

== History ==
:&quot;This section includes edited text from the Willamette National Forest website, which is in the public domain.&quot;

The Cascade Forest Reserve was created in September 1893 by proclamation of U.S. President Grover Cleveland, in response to numerous petitions from local citizens requesting protection of the Cascade Range. The Cascade Forest Reserve stretched from the Columbia River almost to the California border. From 1893 to 1897, the Cascade Forest Reserve was largely managed as a preserve.

The Sundry Civil Appropriations Act of June 1897 (an organic act) appropriated funds for management of the national forest reserves and mandated management goals. Those management goals included: &quot;…securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of the citizens of the United States&quot;, protection of the forests from destruction by fire and depredations, and development of mineral resources, among other provisions. The Organic Act led to establishment of forest reserve boundaries, forest supervisors, and forest ranger patrol districts. Addie Morris and Cy Bingham were noteworthy early rangers in areas that would become the Willamette National Forest.

In 1908, the Cascade Forest Reserve was divided into the Oregon National Forest, the Cascade National Forest, the Umpqua National Forest and the Crater National Forest. In 1911, the Santiam National Forest was created from parts of the Oregon National Forest and the Cascade NF. The Deschutes National Forest was created from the portions that drain into the Deschutes River. In 1933, the Santiam National Forest and the Cascade National Forest were combined to form the Willamette National Forest.

The period of 1905 to 1933 featured decentralized administration for the forests of the western Cascades. Forest and district administrative boundaries were further refined. The U.S. Forest Service made efforts to establish relationships with local communities and with the forest users. This was a time of extensive recreation planning in the western Cascades. A fire control organization was built. Mining claims were established, and the first large timber sales were sold near Detroit and Oakridge.

During the Great Depression and World War II, the Willamette National Forest became a representative of the federal government in the communities of the western Cascades. Efforts were made to improve employment and economic conditions through the Civilian Conservation Corps and through the use of sustained yield forestry. During World War II, the Willamette stepped up timber sales to provide resources for the war effort. Between 1942 and 1945, the Willamette sold of timber.

The years 1945 to 1970 mark an era of intensive forestry and forest management. This era included dramatic increases in recreation use, timber sales, dam construction, campground construction, and wildlife management. Mining claims were looked at much more critically. Grazing on the national forest was reduced and then virtually discontinued during this era. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm downed an estimated of timber and created many log jams on the rivers. Two years later, in 1964, the Christmas week flood hit the Willamette hard. Six campgrounds were fully destroyed, and seven more were damaged. Roads, bridges, and culverts were also lost. The passage of the Wilderness Act earlier that year created new wilderness areas and controversy over the management for the new areas. This era also marked the establishment and growth of an activist environmental movement. The movement is best known for the controversy surrounding the French Pete addition to the Three Sisters Wilderness.

The history of the Forest Service and the Willamette National Forest after 1970 is one of dramatic change and heated controversies. The Willamette&#x27;s timber sales continued at about per year through the 1970s; however, the price bid per thousand increased dramatically. This price speculation led to timber sale defaults and sale buy-backs in the early 1980s. The volume not cut in the early 1980s was resold in the latter half of the decade. The &quot;section 318&quot; bill passed by the U.S. Congress increased the volume sold on the Willamette in 1990 to nearly of timber. After that, timber sale volumes declined rapidly. The Willamette National Forest Land Management Plan was approved in 1990. The plan was amended in 1993 by the Northwest Forest Plan (also called the President&#x27;s Plan). In 1997, the Willamette&#x27;s planned sale volume was .

== Official areas ==

About one fifth, or , of the Willamette National Forest is designated as wilderness area, some of which conserve its old-growth forests:
* Diamond Peak Wilderness at is mostly located within the Deschutes National Forest
* Middle Santiam Wilderness at 
* Menagerie Wilderness at 
* Mount Jefferson Wilderness at is partially located within the Mount Hood and Deschutes National Forests
* Mount Washington Wilderness at is partially located within the Deschutes National Forest
* Opal Creek Wilderness at 
* Three Sisters Wilderness at is partially located within the Deschutes National Forest
* Waldo Lake Wilderness at 

== Geography ==

The elevation of the forest ranges from about 1,500 feet (460 meters) above sea level on the western edge of the forest to almost 10,500 ft (3,200 m) at the top of Mount Jefferson, Oregon&#x27;s second-highest peak. Seven major peaks of the Cascades—Mount Jefferson, Mount Washington, Three Fingered Jack, Diamond Peak, North, Middle and South Sisters—as well as numerous high mountain lakes are within these wilderness areas. The McKenzie and the North Fork Middle Fork Willamette River are part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

==Ecology==
The forest receives 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 millimeters) of precipitation each year from moist onshore Pacific Ocean flow which encounters adiabatic cooling rising over the Cascades. Much of the precipitation is received in the form of snow which accumulates in higher elevations from October through April. The rain and snow melt drain into the McKenzie, Santiam, and Willamette rivers, which flow from the forest and provide high-quality drinking water to Eugene, Salem, Corvallis, and Albany. There are over 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) of rivers and streams in the forest and over 375 lakes.

The forest&#x27;s dominant tree species is the Douglas-fir, the state tree of Oregon. Douglas-fir is a valuable timber species in the United States. The forest contains some stands of old-growth forest, some of which are over tall, among the tallest trees in the world, with tree diameters ranging from . A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was .

Over one dozen other conifer species are common in the forest, including western redcedar, incense-cedar, western white pine, ponderosa pine, Pacific yew, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and several species of fir. The forest is home to over 300 species of fish and wildlife, including the northern spotted owl, mule deer, bald eagle, Chinook salmon, black-tailed deer, bull trout, black bear, cougar, southern red-backed vole, elk, wolverine, and several other sensitive and threatened species.

== Conservation ==

The forest is central to the famous controversy between the logging industry and the endangered species status of the northern spotted owl. Environmentalists maintain that the forest was aggressively clearcut for many years threatening a federally listed endangered species. The timber industry contended that the forest can simultaneously provide lumber jobs and wildlife habitat. Since April 1994, the forest has been governed by the Northwest Forest Plan, which restricts, but does not eliminate, logging in potential spotted owl habitat.

<text>The Battle of Inchon (), also spelled Battle of Incheon, was an amphibious invasion and a battle of the Korean War that resulted in a decisive victory and strategic reversal in favor of the United Nations Command (UN). The operation involved some 75,000 troops and 261 naval vessels and led to the recapture of the South Korean capital of Seoul two weeks later. The code name for the Inchon operation was Operation Chromite.

The battle began on 15 September 1950 and ended on 19 September. Through a surprise amphibious assault far from the Pusan Perimeter that UN and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces were desperately defending, the largely undefended city of Incheon was secured after being bombed by UN forces. The battle ended a string of victories by the North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA). The subsequent UN recapture of Seoul partially severed the KPA&#x27;s supply lines in South Korea.

The UN and ROK forces were commanded by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of the United States Army. MacArthur was the driving force behind the operation, overcoming the strong misgivings of more cautious generals to a risky assault over extremely unfavorable terrain. The battle was followed by a rapid collapse of the KPA; within a month of the Incheon landing, the Americans had taken 135,000 KPA troops prisoner.

==Background==
===Pusan Perimeter===

From the outbreak of the Korean War following the invasion of South Korea by North Korea on 25 June 1950, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and ground combat equipment over the ROK and UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the defending units, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, forcing it to retreat in disarray. From their initial 25 June offensive to fighting in July and early August, the KPA used this tactic to defeat the UN forces they encountered and push southward. However, with the establishment of the Pusan Perimeter in August, UN forces held a continuous line which the KPA could not flank. The KPA advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces.

When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on 5 August, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, they conducted direct assaults resulting in the Battle of Masan, the Battle of Battle Mountain, the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the Battle of Taegu, and the Battle of the Bowling Alley. On the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, the ROK repulsed three KPA divisions at the Battle of P&#x27;ohang-dong. The KPA attacks stalled as UN forces repelled the attack. All along the front, the KPA reeled from these defeats, the first time in the war North Korean tactics had failed.

By the end of August the KPA had been pushed beyond their limits and many of the original units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems wracked the KPA, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for their units. However, the KPA retained high morale and enough supply to allow for another large-scale offensive. On 1 September the KPA threw their entire military into one final bid to break the Pusan Perimeter, the Great Naktong Offensive, a five-pronged simultaneous attack across the entire perimeter. The attack caught UN forces by surprise and almost overwhelmed them. KPA troops attacked Kyongju, surrounded Taegu and Ka-san, recrossed the Naktong Bulge, threatened Yongsan, and continued their attack at Masan, focusing on Nam River and Haman. However, despite their efforts, in one of the most brutal fights of the Korean War, the KPA were unsuccessful. Unable to hold their gains, the KPA retreated from the offensive a much weaker force, and vulnerable to counterattack.

===Planning===

Days after the beginning of the war, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the US Army officer in command of all UN forces in Korea, envisioned an amphibious assault to retake the Seoul area. The city had fallen in the first days of the war in the First Battle of Seoul. MacArthur later wrote that he thought the KPA would push the ROK back far past Seoul. He also said he decided days after the war began that the battered, demoralized, and under-equipped ROK, many of whom did not support the South Korean government put in power by the United States, could not hold off the KPA even with American support. MacArthur felt that he could turn the tide if he made a decisive troop movement behind KPA lines, and preferred Incheon, over Chumunjin-up or Kunsan as the landing site. He had originally envisioned such a landing, code-named Operation Bluehearts, for 22 July, with the US Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division landing at Incheon. However, by 10 July the plan was abandoned as it was clear the 1st Cavalry Division would be needed on the Pusan Perimeter. On 23 July, MacArthur formulated a new plan, code-named Operation Chromite, calling for an amphibious assault by the US Army&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Division and the United States Marine Corps (USMC)&#x27;s 5th Marine Regiment in mid-September 1950. This, too fell through as both units were moved to the Pusan Perimeter. MacArthur decided instead to use the US Army&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division, his last reserve unit in East Asia, to conduct the operation as soon as it could be raised to wartime strength.

In preparation for the invasion, MacArthur activated the US Army&#x27;s X Corps to act as the command for the landing forces, and appointed Major General Edward Almond, his chief of staff, as Corps&#x27; commander, anticipating the operation would mean a quick end to the war. Throughout August, MacArthur faced the challenge of re-equipping the 7th Infantry Division as it had sent 9,000 of its men to reinforce the Pusan Perimeter and was far understrength. He also faced the challenge that the USMC, reduced in size following World War II, had to rebuild the 1st Marine Division, using elements of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade fighting at Pusan as well as the 1st Marine Regiment and the 7th Marine Regiment, which pulled US Marines from as far away as the Mediterranean Sea to Korea for the task. MacArthur ordered Korean Augmentation To the United States Army (KATUSA) troops, ROK conscripts assigned to US Army units, to reinforce the 7th Infantry Division, while allocating all equipment coming into Korea to X Corps, despite it being crucially needed by the US Army&#x27;s Eighth Army on the Pusan Perimeter.
MacArthur decided to use the Joint Strategic and Operations Group (JSPOG) of his United States Far East Command (FECOM). The initial plan was met with skepticism by the other generals because Incheon&#x27;s natural and artificial defenses were formidable. The approaches to Incheon were two restricted passages, which could be easily blocked by naval mines. The current of the channels was also dangerously quick——and tides were so extreme as to prevent immediate follow-on landings. Finally, the anchorage was small and the harbor was surrounded by tall seawalls. United States Navy Commander Arlie G. Capps noted that the harbor had &quot;every natural and geographic handicap.&quot; US Navy leaders favored a landing at Kunsan, closer to the Pusan perimeter and the KPA main axis of supply through Taejon, but MacArthur did not think landing there would produce a sufficiently decisive victory. He also felt that the KPA, who also thought the conditions of the Incheon channel would make a landing impossible, would be surprised and caught off-guard by the attack.

On 23 August, the commanders held a meeting at MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters in Tokyo. Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Joseph Lawton Collins, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Forrest Sherman, and United States Air Force (USAF) operations deputy Lieutenant General Idwal H. Edward all flew from Washington, D.C., to Japan to take part in the briefing; Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force General Hoyt Vandenberg did not attend, possibly because he &quot;did not want to legitimize an operation that essentially belong[ed] to the Navy and the Marines.&quot; The Marine Corps staff, who were to be responsible for leading the landing at Incheon, were not invited, which became a contentious issue. During the briefing, nine members of the staff of US Navy Admiral James H. Doyle spoke for nearly 90 minutes on every technical and military aspect of the landing. MacArthur told the officers that although a landing at Kunsan would bring a relatively easy linkup with the Eighth Army, it &quot;would be an attempted envelopment that would not envelop&quot; and would place more troops in a vulnerable pocket of the Pusan Perimeter. MacArthur won over Sherman by speaking of his affection for the US Navy and relating the story of how the Navy carried him out of Corregidor to safety in 1942 during World War II. Sherman agreed to support the Incheon operation, leaving Doyle furious.
MacArthur spent 45 minutes after the briefing explaining his reasons for choosing Incheon. He said that, because it was so heavily defended, the North Koreans would not expect an attack there, that victory at Incheon would avoid a brutal winter campaign, and that, by invading a northern strong point, UN forces could cut off KPA lines of supply and communication. Sherman and Collins returned to Washington, D.C., and reported back to Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved MacArthur&#x27;s plan on 28 August. President Truman also provided his approval.

The landing at Incheon was not the first large-scale amphibious operation since World War II. That distinction belonged to the United Nations landing that took place on 18 July 1950 at Pohang, South Korea. However, that operation was not made in KPA-held territory and was unopposed.

Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble&#x27;s Joint Task Force 7 consisted of Fast Carrier Task Force 77 for fighter cover, interdiction, and ground attack; Royal Navy Admiral William Andrewes&#x27; Task Force 91 for Blockade and Covering Force; Rear Admiral George R. Henderson&#x27;s Task Force 99 for Patrol and Reconnaissance; Captain Bernard L. Austin&#x27;s Service Squadron 3, operating Task Force 79 for Logistics Support; Admiral James H. Doyle&#x27;s Invasion Force - Attack Task Force 90; and the Military Sea Transportation Service, which was to bring in the United States Army&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division on 18 September 1950.

==Prelude==
Before the main land battle, UN forces landed spies in Incheon and bombarded the city&#x27;s defenses via air and sea. Deception operations were also carried out to draw North Korean attention away from Incheon.

===Maintaining surprise===

With men, supplies, and ships obviously concentrating at Pusan and in Japanese ports for a major amphibious operation and the press in Japan referring to the upcoming landings as &quot;Operation Common Knowledge,&quot; the UN command feared that it would fail to achieve surprise in the Incheon landings. Exacerbating this fear, the leader of a North Korean-Japanese spy ring arrested in Japan in early September 1950 had a copy of the plan for Operation Chromite, and the UN forces did not know whether he had managed to transmit the plan to North Korea before his arrest. US Navy patrol aircraft, surface warships, and submarines operated in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) and the Yellow Sea to detect any reaction by North Korean, Soviet, or People&#x27;s Republic of China military forces, and on 4 September 1950 F4U Corsair fighters of Fighter Squadron 53 (VF-53) operating from the aircraft carrier shot down a Soviet Air Force A-20 Havoc bomber after it opened fire on them over the Yellow Sea as it flew toward the UN naval task force there.

In order to ensure surprise during the landings, UN forces staged an elaborate deception operation to draw North Korean attention away from Incheon by making it appear that the landing would take place to the south at Kunsan. On 5 September 1950, aircraft of the USAF&#x27;s Far East Air Forces began attacks on roads and bridges to isolate Kunsan, typical of the kind of raids expected prior to an invasion there. A naval bombardment of Kunsan followed on 6 September, and on 11 September USAF B-29 Superfortress bombers joined the aerial campaign, bombing military installations in the area.

In addition to aerial and naval bombardment, UN forces took other measures to focus North Korean attention on Kunsan. On the docks at Pusan, USMC officers briefed their men on an upcoming landing at Kunsan within earshot of many Koreans, and on the night of 12–13 September 1950 the Royal Navy frigate landed US Army special operations troops and Royal Marine Commandos on the docks at Kunsan, making sure that North Korean forces noticed their visit.

UN forces conducted a series of drills, tests, and raids elsewhere on the coast of Korea, where conditions were similar to Incheon, before the actual invasion. These drills were used to perfect the timing and performance of the landing craft, but also were intended to confuse the North Koreans further as to the location of the invasion.

===Incheon infiltration===
On 17 August 1950, ROK Navy Intelligence Unit infiltrated in Yonghung-do (Yeongheung Island) and Tokchok-do (Deokjeok Island) conducted Operation X-ray (:ko:X-ray 작전) to obtain information on the conditions there until 14 September. 

Separately on 1 September 1950, UN reconnaissance team (members were from US military intelligence Unit including KLO, CIA) also infiltrated in Yonghung-do (Yeongheung Island) to obtain information on the conditions there.

The team, led by US Navy Lieutenant Eugene F. Clark, landed at Yonghung-do (Yeongheung Island), an island in the mouth of the harbor. From there, the team relayed intelligence back to the UN Command. With the help of locals, Clark gathered information about tides, beach composition, mudflats, and seawalls. A separate reconnaissance mission codenamed Operation Trudy Jackson (:ko:트루디 잭슨 작전), which dispatched Youn Joung (former ROK Navy Lieutenant) and Ke In-ju (former ROK Army Colonel) to Incheon to collect further intelligence on the area, was mounted by the US military.

The tides at Incheon have an average range of and a maximum observed range of , making the tidal range there one of the largest in the world and the littoral maximum in all of Asia. Clark observed the tides at Incheon for two weeks and discovered that American tidal charts were inaccurate, but that Japanese charts were quite good. Clark&#x27;s team provided detailed reports on KPA artillery positions and fortifications on the island of Wolmi-do (Wolmi Island), at Incheon and on nearby islands. During the extended periods of low tide, Clark&#x27;s team located and removed some North Korean naval mines, but, critically to the future success of the invasion, Clark reported that the North Koreans had not in fact systematically mined the channels.

When the KPA discovered that the agents had landed on the islands near Incheon, they made multiple attacks, including an attempted raid on Yonghung-do with six junks. Clark mounted a machine gun on a sampan and sank the attacking junks. In response, the KPA killed perhaps as many as 50 civilians for helping Clark.

===Bombardments of Wolmi-do and Incheon===
On 10 September 1950, five days before the Incheon landing, 43 American warplanes flew over Wolmi-do, dropping 93 napalm canisters to &quot;burn out&quot; its eastern slope in an attempt to clear the way for American troops.

The flotilla of ships that landed and supported the amphibious force during the battle was commanded by Vice Admiral Arthur D. Struble, an expert in amphibious warfare. Struble had participated in amphibious operations in World War II, including the Normandy landings and the Battle of Leyte. He got underway for Incheon in his flagship, the heavy cruiser , on 12 September 1950. Among his ships were the Gunfire Support Group, consisting of &quot;Rochester&quot;, the heavy cruiser , the British light cruisers and , and the six US destroyers of Task Element 90.62, made up of , , , , , and .
Royal Canadian Navy destroyers , and also participated in the invasion task force.
At 07:00 on 13 September, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 9, headed by &quot;Mansfield&quot;, steamed up Flying Fish Channel and into Incheon Harbor, where it fired upon KPA gun emplacements on Wolmi-do and in Incheon. Between them, two British cruisers and six American destroyers fired almost a thousand 5-inch (127-mm) and 6-inch (152-mm) shells onto the fortifications. The attacks tipped off the KPA that a landing might be imminent, and the KPA officer in command on Wolmi-do assured his superiors that he would throw their enemies back into the sea. North Korea&#x27;s 918th Coastal Artillery Regiment returned fire, hitting &quot;Collett&quot; seven times, &quot;Gurke&quot; three times, and &quot;Lyman K. Swenson&quot; twice. Aboard &quot;Lyman K. Swenson&quot;, Lieutenant (junior grade) David H. Swenson was killed and eight others were wounded.
The American destroyers withdrew after bombarding Wolmi-do for an hour and &quot;Rochester&quot;, &quot;Toledo&quot;, &quot;Jamaica&quot;, and &quot;Kenya&quot; proceeded to bombard the KPA batteries for the next three hours from the south of the island. Lieutenant Clark and his South Korean squad watched from hills south of Incheon, plotting locations where KPA machine guns were firing at the flotilla. They relayed this information to the invasion force via Japan in the afternoon.

During the night of 13–14 September, Struble decided on another day of bombardment, and the destroyers moved back up the channel off Wolmi-do on 14 September. They and the cruisers bombarded the island again that day, and planes from the carrier task force bombed and strafed it.
At 00:50 on 15 September 1950, Lieutenant Clark and his South Korean squad activated the lighthouse on the island of Palmido. Later that morning, the ships carrying the amphibious force followed the destroyers toward Incheon and entered Flying Fish Channel, and the US Marines of the invasion force got ready to make the first landings on Wolmi-do.

===Naval mine clearance===
Within weeks of the outbreak of the Korean War, the Soviet Union had shipped naval mines to North Korea for use in coastal defense, with Soviet naval mine warfare experts providing technical instruction in laying and employment of the mines to North Korean personnel. Some of the mines were shipped to Incheon. The UN forces did not become aware of the presence of mines in North Korean waters until early September 1950, raising fears that this would interfere with the Incheon invasion. It was too late to reschedule the landings, but the North Koreans laid relatively few and unsophisticated mines at Incheon. Destroyers in the assault force visually identified moored contact mines in the channel at low tide and destroyed them with gunfire. When the invasion force passed through the channel at high tide to land on the assault beaches, it passed over any remaining mines without incident.

==Battle==

===Green Beach===

At 06:30 on 15 September 1950, the lead elements of X Corps hit &quot;Green Beach&quot; on the northern side of Wolmido. The landing force consisted of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Taplett and nine M26 Pershing tanks from the USMC 1st Tank Battalion. One tank was equipped with a flamethrower and two others had bulldozer blades. The battle group landed from tank landing ships (LSTs). The entire island was captured by noon at the cost of just 14 casualties.

The KPA defenders were outnumbered by more than six to one by the UN troops. KPA casualties included over 200 killed and 136 captured, primarily from the 918th Artillery Regiment and the 226th Independent Marine Regiment. The forces on Green Beach had to wait until 19:50 for the tide to rise, allowing another group to land. During this time, extensive shelling and bombing, along with anti-tank mines placed on the only bridge, kept the small KPA force from launching a significant counterattack. The second wave came ashore at &quot;Red Beach&quot; and &quot;Blue Beach&quot;.

The North Koreans had not been expecting an invasion at Incheon. After the storming of Green Beach, the KPA assumed (probably because of deliberate American disinformation) that the main invasion would happen at Kunsan. As a result, only a small force was diverted to Incheon. Even those forces were too late, and they arrived after the UN forces had taken Blue Beach and Red Beach. The troops already stationed at Incheon had been weakened by Clark&#x27;s guerrillas, and napalm bombing runs had destroyed key ammunition dumps. In total, 261 ships took part.

For Red Beach and Blue Beach, Vice Admiral James H. Doyle, commander of an amphibious ready group, announced that H-Hour, time of landing, would be 17:30.

The KPA 22nd Infantry Regiment had moved to Incheon before dawn on 15 September, but retreated to Seoul after the main landing that evening.

===Red Beach===

The Red Beach forces, made up of the Regimental Combat Team 5, which included the 3rd Battalion of the Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC), used ladders to scale the sea walls. Lieutenant Colonel Raymond L. Murray, serving as commanding officer of the 5th Marines, had the mission of seizing an area long and deep, extending from Cemetery Hill (northern) at the top down to the Inner Tidal Basin (near Tidal Basin at the bottom) and including the promontory in the middle called Observatory Hill. (See Map) The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines would be on the left, against Cemetery Hill and northern half of Observatory Hill. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines would take the southern half of Observatory Hill and Inner Basin.
Late on the afternoon of 15 September the LSTs approached Red Beach and as the lead ships, they came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire from KPA defenders on Cemetery Hill. Despite the concentrated fire, they disembarked assault troops and unloaded vital support equipment. In addition, their guns wiped out KPA batteries on the right flank of Red Beach. Three (, , and &quot;LST 973&quot;) of the eight LSTs took some hits from mortar and machine gun fire, which killed a sailor and injured a few others. The LSTs completed unloading and cleared the beach at high tide early on 16 September.

After neutralizing KPA defenses at Incheon on the night of 15 September, units from Red Beach opened the causeway to Wolmi-do, allowing the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines and the tanks from Green Beach to enter the battle for Incheon.

===Blue Beach===
The 1st Marine Regiment, under the command of Colonel Lewis &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, landed at Blue Beach, southeast of Red and Green beaches. Their mission, once the beach was secure, was to capture the suburb of Yongdungp&#x27;o, cross the Han River, and form the right flank of the attack on Seoul itself. As the 1st Marine Regiment approached the coast, the combined fire from several KPA gun emplacements sank one LST. Destroyer fire and bombing runs silenced the KPA defenses. When the Blue Beach forces finally arrived, the KPA forces at Incheon had already surrendered, so they met little opposition and suffered few additional casualties. The 1st Marine Regiment spent much of its time strengthening the beachhead and preparing for the move inland.

Immediately after KPA resistance was extinguished in Incheon, the supply and reinforcement process began. Seabees and Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) that had arrived with the US Marines constructed a pontoon dock on Green Beach and cleared debris from the water. The dock was then used to unload the remainder of the LSTs. Early that morning of 16 September, Lieutenant Colonel Murray and Puller had their operational orders from 1st Marine Division commander General Oliver P. Smith. The 5th Marines (from Red and Green Beaches) started generally east along the Incheon-Seoul road, intending to link up with the left of the 1st Marine Regiment so both regiments could move on Seoul. Six solitary T-34 tanks moving west towards Incheon appeared as the advancing 5th Marines reached the village of Kansong-ni. A strike force of eight Marine F4U Corsairs from VMF-214 attacked the tanks, destroying two and driving the others off. M26 Pershing tanks of the 1st Tank Battalion destroyed three more KPA tanks shortly thereafter. South of the 5th Marines, the 1st Marines, having spent most of the day consolidating its scattered units, did not move east until about 16:00.

During the night of 16-17 September, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, occupied a forward defensive position commanding the Seoul highway just west of Ascom City. Behind it the 1st Battalion held a high hill. From a forward roadblock position, members of an advanced platoon of D Company, at 05:45 on the 17th, saw the dim outlines of six tanks on the road eastward. Infantry accompanied the tanks, some riding on the armor. The KPA armored force moved past the hidden outpost of D Company. At 06:00, at a range of yards, rockets fired from a bazooka set one of the tanks on fire. Pershing tanks now opened fire on the T-34s and recoilless rifles joined in. Within five minutes combined fire destroyed all six enemy tanks and killed 200 of an estimated 250 enemy infantry. Only one man in the 2nd Battalion was wounded.

==Air attack on USS &quot;Rochester&quot; and HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot;==
Just before daylight at 05:50 on 17 September, two Soviet-made North Korean aircraft—probably Yakovlev Yak-9s—were seen overhead from &quot;Jamaica&quot;, and while trying to identify them any doubts about their allegiance and intentions were resolved by the explosion of a bomb close to the port side of &quot;Rochester&quot;. Four bombs were dropped, one hitting and denting &quot;Rochester&#x27;s&quot; crane but not exploding. There were no American casualties. As the aircraft turned away &quot;Jamaica&quot; opened fire with her port battery on the leading aircraft. The second aircraft then turned to port to strafe &quot;Jamaica&quot;, scoring several hits: one armor-piercing round entering Y turret through the armor at the back of the gun house and wounding a man in the leg; one chipping the side armor of the ship; one exploding round burst on the plate surrounding the loaders of a quadruple pom-pom, wounding three men (one of whom died later of his wounds after being transferred to the hospital ship ); and one on the foremast at the level of the gun direction platform, scattering small splinters. Every close range weapon available opened fire on this aircraft, which disintegrated as it went over the ship, crashing close to the starboard side of &quot;Jamaica&quot;.

==Breakthrough==
===Kimpo Airfield===
Kimpo airfield was the largest and most important in Korea and MacArthur demanded its early capture. Once it was secured, the Fifth Air Force and USMC aviation units could bring fighters and bombers over from Japan to operate more easily against North Korea.
The 5th Marines advanced rapidly on the 17th and by 18:00 its 2nd Battalion was at the edge of Kimpo airfield. In the next two hours the battalion seized the southern part of the airfield. The 400-500 KPA soldiers who ineffectively defended it appeared surprised and had not even mined the runway. During the night several small enemy counterattacks hit the perimeter positions at the airfield between 02:00 and dawn, 18 September. The Marines repulsed these company-sized counterattacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the KPA troops, who finally fled to the northwest; E Company and supporting tanks played the leading role in these actions. Kimpo was secured during the morning of 18 September. Kimpo airfield was in excellent shape; the North Koreans had not had time to do any major demolition. In fact, several North Korean planes were still on the field. Kimpo would now become the center of UN land-based air operations.

On 19 September US engineers repaired the local railroad up to inland. After the capture of Kimpo airfield, transport planes began flying in gasoline and ordnance for the aircraft stationed there. The Marines continued unloading supplies and reinforcements. By 22 September they had unloaded 6,629 vehicles and 53,882 troops, along with 25,512 tons (23,000 tonnes) of supplies.

===Advance to the Han River===
On the 18th, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, sent units on to the Han River beyond the airfield, and the 1st Battalion captured Hill 99 northeast of it and then advanced to the river. Continuing its sweep along the river, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, on the 19th swung right and captured the last high ground (Hills 118, 80, and 85) a mile west of Yongdungp&#x27;o. At the same time, the 2nd Battalion seized the high ground along the Han River in its sector. At nightfall, 19 September, the 5th Marines held the south bank of the Han River everywhere in its zone and was preparing for a crossing the next morning.

Meanwhile, the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade relieved the ROK Marines of responsibility for the security of Inchon, and the ROK&#x27;s moved up on the 18th and 19th to the Han River near Kimpo. Part of the ROK Marines extended the left flank of the 5th Marines, and its 2nd Battalion joined them for the projected crossing of the Han River the next day. In this action, the 1st Marines had attacked east toward Yongdungp&#x27;o astride the Seoul highway. Its armored spearheads destroyed four KPA tanks early on the morning of the 17th. Then, from positions on high ground (Hills 208, 107, 178), short of Sosa, a village halfway between Inchon and
Yongdungp&#x27;o, a regiment of the KPA 18th Division checked the advance. At nightfall the Marine regiment dug in for the night a mile from Sosa. At Ascom City, just west of Sosa, American troops found 2,000 tons of ammunition for American artillery, mortars, and machine guns, captured there by the North Koreans in June, all still in good condition.

On the morning of the 18th the 1st Marines resumed their attack and passed through and around the burning town of Sosa at midmorning. By noon the 3rd Battalion had seized Hill 123, a mile east of the town and north of the highway. KPA artillery fire there caused many casualties in the afternoon, but neither ground nor aerial observers could locate the artillery firing from the southeast. Beyond Sosa the North Koreans had heavily mined the highway and on 19 September the tank spearheads stopped after mines damaged two tanks. Engineers began the slow job of removing the mines and, without tank support, the infantry advance slowed. But at nightfall advanced elements of the regiment had reached Kal-ch&#x27;on Creek just west of Yongdungp&#x27;o.

On the morning of 18 September, the 7th Infantry Division&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment landed at Incheon and the remainder of the regiment went ashore later in the day. The next morning, the 2nd Battalion moved up to relieve a Marine battalion occupying positions on the right flank south of Seoul. Meanwhile, the 7th Division&#x27;s 31st Infantry Regiment came ashore at Incheon. Responsibility for the zone south of Seoul highway passed to the 7th Division at 18:00 on 19 September. The 7th Infantry Division then engaged in heavy fighting with KPA forces on the outskirts of Seoul.

===Battle of Seoul===


In contrast to the quick victory at Incheon, the advance on Seoul was slow and bloody.

Before the battle, North Korea had just one understrength division in the city, with the majority of its forces south of the capital. X Corps commander Almond assumed command of the operation on September 21 and was in an enormous hurry to capture Seoul by September 25, exactly three months after the North Korean assault across the 38th Parallel. On 20 September, the Marines entered Seoul and casualties mounted as the forces engaged in house-to-house fighting.

Almond declared Seoul liberated the evening of 25 September, a claim repeated by MacArthur the following day. However, at the time of Almond&#x27;s declaration, US Marines were still engaged in house-to-house combat as the KPA remained in most of the city. It was not until 28 September that the last of the KPA elements were driven out or destroyed.

===Pusan Perimeter breakout===

While the 5th Marines came ashore at Incheon, the last KPA troops in South Korea still fighting were defeated when Walton H. Walker&#x27;s Eighth Army breakout from the Pusan Perimeter started on 16 September, joining the Army&#x27;s X Corps in a coordinated attack on KPA forces. By 22 September the KPA forces around the Perimeter were in full retreat and the Eighth Army and ROK forces began a full counteroffensive to pursue the KPA on 23 September. Of the 70,000 KPA troops around Pusan, in the aftermath of the Pusan Perimeter battle, KPA casualties from 1-15 September ranged from 36,000 to 41,000 killed and captured, with an unknown total number of wounded. However, because UN forces had concentrated on taking Seoul rather than cutting off the KPA&#x27;s withdrawal north, the remaining 30,000 KPA soldiers escaped to the north, where they were soon reconstituted as a cadre for the formation of new KPA divisions hastily re-equipped by the Soviet Union. The UN assault continued into North Korea on 30 September.

==Analysis==
Most military scholars consider the battle one of the most decisive military operations in modern warfare. Spencer C. Tucker, the American military historian, described the Incheon landings as &quot;a brilliant success, almost flawlessly executed,&quot; which remained &quot;the only unambiguously successful, large-scale US combat operation&quot; for the next 40 years. Commentators have described the Incheon operation as MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;greatest success&quot; and &quot;an example of brilliant generalship and military genius.&quot;

However, Russell Stolfi argues that the landing itself was a strategic masterpiece but it was followed by an advance to Seoul in ground battle so slow and measured that it constituted an operational disaster, largely negating the successful landing. He contrasts the US military&#x27;s 1950 Inchon-Seoul operation with the German offensive in the Baltic in 1941. American forces achieved a strategic masterpiece in the Inchon landing in September 1950 and then largely negated it by a slow, tentative, 11-day advance on Seoul, only away. By contrast, in the Baltic region in 1941 the German forces achieved strategic surprise on the first day of their offensive and then, exhibiting a breakthrough mentality, pushed forward rapidly, seizing key positions and advancing almost in four days. The American advance was characterized by cautious, restrictive orders, concerns about phase lines, limited reconnaissance and command posts well in the rear, while the Germans positioned their leaders as far forward as possible, relied on oral or short written orders, reorganized combat groups to meet immediate circumstances, and engaged in vigorous reconnaissance. Despite this criticism, Inchon was taken within 24 hours with the loss of only a few dozen U.S. troops and General Walton Walker refused to go on the offensive in southeastern South Korea unless the Inchon landings were successful, as shown in the Pusan Perimeter Offensive.

<doc id="1055748" wikidata="Q3454185" url="?curid=1055748" title="Sequel (album)">
<text>Sequel is the ninth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1980 (see 1980 in music). It was the last complete album released during Harry&#x27;s lifetime. A tenth studio album, &quot;The Last Protest Singer&quot;, made up of material he was working on at the time of his death, was released about six years after he died.

The title song reports further events in the lives of Harry and Sue, the characters in Chapin&#x27;s hit song &quot;Taxi&quot;, and peaked at  23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (the original went to No. 24). A follow-up single, &quot;Story of a Life&quot;, failed to reach the Hot 100 chart (peaking at No. 105), but is historic as it was Chapin&#x27;s final 45.

The album was re-released under the title &quot;Remember When the Music&quot; with the addition of two previously unreleased tracks. It was re-released with only the original ten tracks as &quot;Storyteller&quot; in 1999. It was also remastered in 2001 with four additional tracks.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that &quot;the album is bogged down in gushing sentimentality, and is ultimately 44 minutes, 35 seconds of maudlin musical waste.&quot;

<doc id="1055751" wikidata="Q3107459" url="?curid=1055751" title="Dagger of the Mind">
<text>&quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot; is the ninth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Shimon Wincelberg (under the pen name &quot;S. Bar-David&quot;) and directed by Vincent McEveety, it first aired on November 3, 1966.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; visits a rehabilitation facility for the criminally insane where the chief doctor has been using a device which destroys the human mind.

This episode introduces the Vulcan mind meld.

The title is taken from a soliloquy by the title character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, commanded by Captain Kirk, makes a supply run to planet Tantalus V, a colony where the criminally insane are confined for treatment. The facility&#x27;s director is Dr. Tristan Adams, a psychiatrist famous for advocating more humane treatment of such patients. After the &quot;Enterprise&quot; delivers supplies and receives cargo from Tantalus, a man emerges from the container taken aboard and assaults a technician. Reaching the bridge, the intruder demands asylum, but Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch. In sickbay, the intruder identifies himself as Simon van Gelder, and a computer check reveals that he is not a patient, but Dr. Adams&#x27;s assistant.

When they inform Tantalus of van Gelder&#x27;s capture, Dr. Adams claims that van Gelder&#x27;s testing of an experimental treatment device on himself is responsible for his disturbed condition. McCoy, suspicious, urges Kirk to investigate. Kirk transports down to the colony with one of the ship&#x27;s psychiatrists, Dr. Helen Noel.

Adams introduces them to a strangely emotionless therapist, Lethe, and gives Kirk and Noel a tour of the colony. Although he is affable and accommodating, his staff, like Lethe, all seem lacking in affect. Adams shows Kirk and Noel the treatment device he referred to: a &quot;neural neutralizer&quot;. He claims that the machine, harmless at low intensity, is used only to calm agitated inmates. Noel is satisfied with his explanation, but Kirk remains suspicious.

On the &quot;Enterprise&quot; van Gelder becomes increasingly frantic, warning that the landing party is in danger, but when he tries to explain the danger and refers to the neural neutralizer, he is convulsed with pain. Spock mind-melds with van Gelder to enable him to tell his story. Spock learns that the neural neutralizer can empty a mind of thoughts, leaving only an unbearable feeling of loneliness, and that Adams has been using it on inmates and staff to gain total control of their minds. The first officer assembles a security team, but the colony&#x27;s force field blocks transport and communication.

Unaware of events on the ship, Kirk decides to secretly test the neutralizer on himself, with Noel at the controls. She finds that she can easily implant thoughts into Kirk&#x27;s mind, even altering his memory of a recent Christmas-party encounter between the two of them. Adams appears, overpowers Noel, seizes the controls, increases the neutralizer&#x27;s intensity, and proceeds to convince Kirk that he has been madly in love with Noel for years. Kirk and Noel are then confined to quarters.

On Kirk&#x27;s orders, Noel enters the facility&#x27;s physical plant through a ventilation duct, and interrupts Kirk&#x27;s next neutralizer session by shutting off power to the entire complex. Freed from the neutralizer, Kirk attacks Adams, leaving him alone and unconscious in the treatment room. A guard discovers Noel&#x27;s sabotage, they fight and she defeats him with an athletic kick that sends him hurtling into the electric circuitry, killing him. With the force field now off, Spock beams down to the planet, disables the force field, and restores power to the colony. This reactivates the neural neutralizer, and without anyone else in the room to say anything, it completely empties Adams&#x27; mind, killing him.

Back on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk is informed that van Gelder has destroyed the neural neutralizer. McCoy is surprised that loneliness could be lethal, but Kirk, after his experience, is not.

==Production==
The episode&#x27;s title was taken from William Shakespeare&#x27;s Macbeth. Macbeth is planning to murder the King of Scotland, and sees a dagger that he attempts to grasp, but it&#x27;s only a hallucination.

Shimon Wincelberg originally wrote a reference to Hillel the Elder&#x27;s “Torah on one leg” parable, but Roddenberry mandated an attribution to “the ancient skeptic.” Wincelberg, incensed by Roddenberry&#x27;s rewrites, requested a name change to S. Bar-David for the airing.

Playing mentally disturbed Van Gelder took a toll on the actor Morgan Woodward. Reportedly when he finished filming the episode he went home and took a rest for four days.

==Reception==
In 2010, &quot;SciFiNow&quot; ranked this the eighth best episode of the original series.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;B&quot; rating, noting that the episode had &quot;a handful of excellent moments (the mind-meld, that damn booth) that don&#x27;t fit as well as they should&quot;. Handlen noted Kirk and Noel&#x27;s relationship as the plot&#x27;s &quot;weakest element&quot;, and that Adams did not make a compelling villain. On the other hand, he felt that Nimoy made Spock&#x27;s mind meld sequence &quot;fairly effective&quot;. The booth and its effect on Adams were also cited as memorable moments in the episode.

==Legacy and influence==
* In articles in the magazines &quot;Starlog&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, actor Morgan Woodward called the role of Dr. Simon Van Gelder the most physically and emotionally exhausting acting job of his career. Desperate to get out of Westerns and expand his range, he was cast against type for this episode and was so well regarded that he came on board next season to play the tragic Capt. Ronald Tracey in &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;. Playing Van Gelder did take its toll on his personal life, as he confessed that for three weeks afterwards he was anti-social towards friends and family. He was grateful that this episode opened up whole new opportunities for him.
* The second-season &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods&quot; is a parody of this episode.

<text>George Kirbye (c. 1565 – buried 6 October 1634) was an English composer of the late Tudor period and early Jacobean era. He was one of the members of the English Madrigal School, but also composed sacred music.

Little is known of the details of his life, though some of his contacts can be inferred. He worked at Rushbrooke Hall near Bury St Edmunds, evidently as a tutor to the daughters of Sir Robert Jermyn. In 1598 he married Anne Saxye, afterwards moving to Bury St Edmunds. Around this time he probably made the acquaintance of John Wilbye, a much more famous madrigalist, who lived and worked only a few miles away, and whose style he sometimes approaches. In 1626 his wife died, and he is known to have been a churchwarden at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bury St Edmunds during the next several years until his death.

Kirbye&#x27;s most significant musical contributions were the psalm settings he wrote for East&#x27;s psalter, &quot;The Whole Book of Psalmes&quot; (1592), the madrigals he wrote for the &quot;Triumphs of Oriana&quot; (1601), the famous collection dedicated to Elizabeth I, and an independent set of madrigals published in 1597. Kirbye was employed by East to arrange tunes featured in his psalter, and it is his arrangement, with the melody in the tenor, of Tye&#x27;s melody to accompany Psalm 84 &quot;How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place&quot; which is today sung to While Shepherds watched their flocks by night.

Stylistically, his madrigals have more in common with the Italian models provided by Marenzio than do many of the others by his countrymen: they tend to be serious, in a minor mode, and show a careful attention to text setting; unlike Marenzio, however, he is restrained in his specific imagery.

Kirbye avoided the light style of Morley, which was hugely popular, and brought into the madrigal serious style of pre-madrigal English music. He is not as often sung as Morley, Weelkes or Wilbye, but neither was he as prolific; still, some of his madrigals appear in modern collections, such as the Oxford Book of English Madrigals.

<text>The Rouen Business School () was a leading French business school.
It was founded in 1871. On 24 April 2013, Rouen Business School and Reims Management School announced the merger of the two schools into a single entity - NEOMA Business School.

Rouen Business School&#x27;s quality is recognised by its &quot;triple-crown&quot; accreditations (AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS) and its &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27; ranking 13th position best European Master in Management. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; also highlights the particular quality of the education it provides in finance, ranking the &quot;Grande Ecole&quot; program 8th best in Europe and 4th best in France.

==History==
Established in 1871 in the then-vibrant industrial city of Rouen, it is the second business school to be created in France.

Groupe ESC Rouen was formed in 1996, gathering together four independent schools, all managed and financed mainly by the Rouen Chamber of Commerce and Industry. These schools are ESC Rouen, the leading school of the group, IFI, ISPP and ECAL - each school having a distinctive mission and student base.

ESC Rouen is a founding member of the Chapitre des Ecoles du Management de la Conférence des Grandes Ecoles (Chapter of Management Schools belonging to the Conférence des Grandes Ecoles). The school is also a member of EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) and AACSB (International Association for Management Education).

ESC Rouen received EQUIS accreditation from the European Foundation for Management Development for a second time in May 2005. Later, the school has received AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) and AMBA (Association of Masters of Business Administration) accreditations.

<doc id="1055763" wikidata="Q7634956" url="?curid=1055763" title="Sugar plantations in the Caribbean">
<text>Sugar plantations in the Caribbean were a major part of the economy of the islands in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Most Caribbean islands were covered with sugar cane fields and mills for refining the crop. The main source of labor, until the abolition of chattel slavery, was enslaved Africans. After the abolition of slavery, indentured laborers from India, China, Portugal and other places were brought to the Caribbean to work in the sugar industry. These plantations produced 80 to 90 percent of the sugar consumed in Western Europe, later supplanted by European-grown sugar beet.

== The sugar trade ==
===Sugar cane development in the Americas===
The Portuguese introduced sugar plantations in the 1550s off the coast of their Brazilian settlement colony, located on the island of Sao Vincente. As the Portuguese and Spanish maintained a strong colonial presence in the Caribbean, the Iberian Peninsula amassed tremendous wealth from the cultivation of this cash crop. Other imperial states observed the economic boom catalyzed by the plantation system. They began colonizing the remaining American territories, hoping to capitalize on the lucrative cultivation and trade of natural resources.

Sugar was the most important crop throughout the Caribbean, although other crops such as coffee, indigo, and rice were also grown. Sugar cane was best grown on relatively flat land near coastal waters, where the soil was naturally yellow and fertile; mountainous parts of the islands were less likely to be used for cane cultivation. The coastal placement of commercial ports gave imperial states a geographic advantage in shipping crops throughout the transatlantic world.

Sugar created a unique political ecology, the relationship between labor, profits, and ecological consequences, in the Caribbean. Imperial powers forcefully displaced West African peoples to cultivate sugar using slave labor. By exploiting labor and the natural world, imperial conflicts arose in the Caribbean vying for political and economic control. For example, conflicts among the English, Spanish, French, Dutch, and various indigenous peoples manifested for territorial gain; regarding the region&#x27;s political ecology, these European states exploited the environment&#x27;s resources to such an extent that sugar production stagnated. Due to the loss of trees, needed for timber in the sugar refinement process, European imperial powers began competing and fighting over the Caribbean during the middle 17th century. This process would not have been possible without the invention of windmills to produce sugar more efficiently.

Following European settlers&#x27; entry into the Caribbean world, massive demographic changes occurred. Indigenous populations began dying at unprecedented rates due to the influx of old-world diseases brought by colonists. Estimates of these population losses vary from 8.4 million to 112.5 million. This extreme diminishment of native populations cleared room for plantation construction and lessened the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples.

===Move from South America to the Caribbean===
Although the sugar trade in the Americas was initially dominated by the Portuguese Empire, the Dutch–Portuguese War would cause a shift which would have knock-on effects for the further growth of the sugar trade in the Caribbean and particularly the production of rum (made from sugar cane juice). In 1630, the Dutch seized Recife near Pernambuco in what is today Brazil (the Dutch called this New Holland after they took over) and this territory included some sugar plantations worked by African slaves who had been brought to the territory earlier. Some of the slave plantation owners were &quot;Cristão-Novo&quot;, i.e. &quot;New Christian&quot; Sephardic Jews who had been forced to convert to the Catholic Church. As the Portuguese Inquisition was in operation and the Dutch Calvinists were generally more tolerant of Jews, they were happy to side with them over the Catholic Portuguese and remained in the area operating their substantial sugar-orientated slave plantations, now under Dutch sovereignty. They even founded the first public synagogue in the Americas there in 1636; the Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue.

Further north in the Caribbean, the Protestant Kingdom of England was beginning to challenge the interest of the Catholic powers in the region such as the Spanish Empire and the Kingdom of France, taking control of a number of islands, including Jamaica and Barbados. One of these men, Colonel James Drax who had interests in Barbados, visited Dutch Brazil in 1640 and purchased a triple-roller sugar mill and a set of copper cauldrons (used for turning sugar cane into molasses, i.e. sugar cane juice used in rum production). This technology, although originating in Sicily had spread to the New World and had been improved to aid the sugar plantations in other ways, bringing their expert knowledge of technologies in cultivating rum from the sugar cane and working as merchants, supplying them with African slaves to work the plantations, helping to make Barbados the sugar capital of the Caribbean and the rum capital of the world. By 1706, the laws against Jews owning sugar plantations in Barbados were dropped, by which time Jewish involvement in rum production was reduced to a nominal status.

During the colonial period, the arrival of sugar culture deeply impacted the society and economy in the Caribbean. It not only dramatically increased the ratio of slaves to free men, but it increased the average size of slave plantations. Early sugar plantations made extensive use of slaves because sugar was considered a cash crop that exhibited economies of scale in cultivation; it was most efficiently grown on large plantations with many workers. People from Africa were imported and made to work on the plantations. For example, prior to 1650 more than three-quarters of the islands&#x27; population were of European descent. In 1680, the median size of a plantation in Barbados had increased to about 60 slaves. Over the decades, the sugar plantations began expanding as the transatlantic trade continued to prosper. In 1832, the median-size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves. For about 100 years, Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region. The colony&#x27;s prosperity remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production expanded in larger colonies, such as Saint-Domingue and Jamaica. As part of the mass sugar industry, sugar cane processing gave rise to related commodities such as rum, molasses, and falernum.

The West India Interest was formed in the 1740s, when the British merchants joined with the West Indian sugar planters. The British and West Indies shared profits and needs. This organization was the first sugar-trading organization which had a large voice in Parliament.

In the 1740s, Jamaica and Saint Domingue (Haiti) became the world&#x27;s main sugar producers. They increased production in Saint Domingue by using an irrigation system that French engineers built. The engineers also built reservoirs, diversion dams, levees, aqueducts, and canals. In addition, they improved their mills and used varieties of cane and grasses.

===19th century===
According to a 2021 study, &quot;historical property rights institutions [in Haiti] created high transaction costs for converting land to cane production&quot;, relative to the other Caribbean countries. As a result, Haiti lost its place as the leading sugar producer in the world.

After the end of slavery in Saint Domingue at the turn of the 19th century, with the Haitian Revolution, Cuba became the most substantial sugar plantation colony in the Caribbean, outperforming the British islands.

In the 19th century, sugar dominated Martinique, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Croix, Barbados, the Leeward Islands, Saint Domingue, Cuba, as well as many other islands that had been run by French, British, or Spanish owners. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the sugar cane industry came to dominate Puerto Rico&#x27;s economy, both under the colonial rule of Spain and under the United States.

After slavery, sugar plantations used a variety of forms of labour including workers imported from colonial India and Southern China working as indentured servants on European owned plantations (coolie). In the 20th century, large-scale sugar production using wage labour continued in many parts of the region.

== Slavery on Caribbean sugar plantations ==

The Europeans forced the indigenous peoples of various Caribbean islands to provide the physical labor necessary for the production of sugarcane. The indigenous populations of the Caribbean were decimated by illness after initial colonization and were left with few numbers. In order to continue production for the crop, Europeans introduced African slaves to the island through the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. The time at which this happened varies from island to island.

Sugarcane harvesting during the time of colonization in the Caribbean was a labor-intensive process. Firstly, it was harvested by hand, and the sucrose inside needed to be harvested quickly to not be spoiled. To extract the juice, it must be chopped, ground, pressed, pounded, or soaked in liquid before it is heated. Once heated, the liquids evaporate until only the crystals remain. Each step is labor-intensive and requires technical knowledge and skill. These tasks were performed by enslaved individuals until emancipation.

In 1807, Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act, prohibiting the trade of slaves in the British Empire. This act extended to the Caribbean plantations under British control. Without the labor influx of slaves through the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the system became harder to maintain. Years later, in 1838, more than half a million people in the Caribbean were emancipated from slavery as a result of the 1833 Emancipation Bill.

Slavery on Plantations in the Caribbean involved a series of interconnected relationships and power dynamics between the enslaved and the more elite population on the island. Women were integral in the social dynamic of the plantations and in the labor itself. &quot;There was a gendering of health, wealth and energy on sugar plantations. The majority of field slaves were women and the majority of women worked in the field.&quot;. Women were heavily involved in the labor of the plantations and were also having children and going to work in the fields at the same time. The Newton Slave Burial Ground showed the evidence of this brutality towards enslaved women, &quot;which may point towards greater levels of interpersonal abuse or even domestic violence for women&quot;. The brutality towards enslaved women is reflected in the archaeological evidence on the Newton Burial Ground.

== Environmental impact ==
The sugar cane industry had an adverse impact on the environment as this industry grew in Caribbean countries. These included the destruction of forests, water pollution, and loss of fertility and erosion of soils. These problems were seen on various different scales in the Dominican Republic in the 16th century; Martinique in the 17th century; Jamaica and Haiti in the 18th century; and Cuba and Puerto Rico in the 19th century.

In 1492, Christopher Columbus arrived on the northern coast of Hispaniola and Spanish colonization began to establish itself. By the late 16th century, demand and production for sugar, one of the central exports of the island, had increased. Much of the indigenous population suffered from disease and famine, and many pre-colonial smaller-scale farms were replaced by larger-scale farms. These farms required more land and moist soil close to water sources, resulting in deforestation and water pollution.

During the 17th century in the Lesser Antilles, many of the islands in the Lesser Antilles suffered ecological losses after the introduction of monoculture for sugar plantations. On the Caribbean island Nevis in particular, the island was nearly deforested during the mid-1600s and much of the topsoil quality deteriorated as a result of a large influx of plantations.

Although these nations have taken measures to mitigate the impacts of the sugar revolution, in some there are still traces of what the environmental historian of the Caribbean and Latin America, Reinaldo Funes Monzote, describes as a &quot;serious deterioration&quot; of the natural environment, with socio-economic consequences.

The impacts concerning irrigation and pollution of water runoff are seen as the most profound issues in sugar cane cultivation.

<text>Rob Fleming (born November 11, 1971) is a Canadian politician who sat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 2005 provincial election, when he defeated one-term Liberal Party incumbent, Sheila Orr, until 2024. Initially representing Victoria-Hillside, he was re-elected in subsequent elections in the renamed constituency of Victoria-Swan Lake. A member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP), he was named to the cabinet of British Columbia in July 2017 as Minister of Education, before assuming the post as Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure in November 2020, serving in that position until 2024. Prior to entering provincial politics, he was a city councillor in Victoria, British Columbia from 1999 to 2005.

In the 38th Parliament Fleming was the New Democrat critic for Advanced Education, sat on the Select Standing Committee on Education, and introduced two education-related private member bills: the &quot;Private Post-Secondary Accountability and Student Protection Act, 2007&quot; and the &quot;Restoring Credibility to Universities Act, 2008&quot;. He was also assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts and introduced the &quot;Payday Lending Act, 2006&quot; which sought to regulate the conditions of payday loans and led to the government adopting the &quot;Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act&quot; a year later.

In the 39th Parliament Fleming became the NDP&#x27;s environment critic. He introduced the &quot;Cosmetic Pesticide and Carcinogen Control Act&quot; and sat on the subsequent Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which investigated potential bans or regulations on pesticides used for cosmetic purposes. Fleming also introduced the &quot;Species at Risk Protection Act&quot;, after the government delayed a promise to review its species-at-risk legislation, and the &quot;Sustainable Development Indicators and Reporting Act, 2011&quot; which sought to create a Sustainable Development Board to report on provincial sustainability-related indicators. Fleming sat on the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives which considered the petition seeking the repeal of the Harmonized Sales Tax.

In the 40th Parliament Fleming was appointed to be the NDP&#x27;s education critic. He introduced the private member bill &quot;Youth Voter Registration Act&quot; that would have allowed provisional voter registration of people between the ages of 16 and 18, a measure that was later adopted in 2019.

==Background==
Born in Windsor, Ontario, Fleming and his family moved to BC when he was three years old, settling on Greater Vancouver&#x27;s North Shore. In the 1988 federal election, he assisted in the New Democratic Party&#x27;s campaign in the riding of Capilano—Howe Sound. From 1993 to 1995 he attended the university transfer program at Camosun College in Saanich, which later awarded him the 2008 Distinguished Alumni Award. While at Camosun, Fleming served as communications coordinator for the student society.

He then enrolled in the University of Victoria (UVic), where he majored in history. As president of the UVic Students&#x27; Society, he was active in acquiring universal access to BC Transit for students through a U-Pass system. After graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in 2002, he started work with a communication consulting business.

He met his wife Maura Parte while attending UVic; they have two children together.

==Municipal politics==
While still at university, he stood as a candidate for Victoria City Council in the 1999 municipal elections as a member of the Victoria Civic Electors, which ran a joint slate of seven candidates with the Green Party. Fleming finished third in voting, securing him a seat on the eight-member council. He was re-elected councillor in 2002, this time receiving the second highest vote count. He traveled to El Salvador in 2004, as part of a 13-member delegation of election observers to monitor the presidential election.

While on Victoria City Council, Fleming gained a reputation for being a &quot;fiscally prudent democratic socialist&quot;. He supported the legalization of secondary suites, the construction of the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre (but voted against the option to have it privately operated), and amendments to bylaws to target aggressive panhandling. As a director on the board of the Capital Regional District (CRD), Fleming was vice-chair of the CRD Housing Corporation where he advocated for an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. He sat on the Victoria Regional Transit Commission and has advocated for transit service expansion and light rail in Greater Victoria. He was a member of the Provincial Capital Commission and was the only member to vote against, due to concerns with the long-term lease agreement and risks involved, replacing the plant and animal conservatory Crystal Gardens with the multi-media tourist attraction, The B.C. Experience, which filed for bankruptcy protection three months after opening.

==Provincial politics==
With the 2005 BC general election still a year away, Fleming declared his interest in seeking the NDP nomination in the Victoria-Hillside riding. Within a few months, former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Steve Orcherton, who had won the riding in 1996 but lost in 2001, declared his candidacy for the NDP nomination. The primary was billed as a contest between the hard line &quot;old-school union man&quot; Orcherton versus the &quot;new wave&quot; moderate Fleming which was seen as the symbolic struggle that was occurring throughout the party. Fleming won the NDP nomination in January and began campaigning in April for the general election. Fleming was one of five candidates across the province who were endorsed by the Conservation Voters of British Columbia. In the May general election Fleming defeated the incumbent BC Liberal Sheila Orr and Green Party candidate and small business owner Steve Filipovic. Fleming resigned from his position as Victoria city councillor to become a New Democratic MLA, as part of the Official Opposition.

===38th Parliament===
In the 38th Parliament, Fleming and chaired the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts and part way through the 2nd session he was assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Education which focused on adult literacy. He introduced several pieces of legislation, including the &quot;Payday Lending Act, 2006&quot;, which sought to license payday lenders and regulate the conditions of payday loans, including plain language rules, rights to cancellation, signage requirements. While Solicitor General John Les stated he was in favour of many of the regulations, he felt the bill was premature and that changes to the federal &quot;Criminal Code&quot; were required before proceeding with such regulations, despite other provinces already having passed similar legislation. The bill was granted first reading on May 8, 2006, but without the government support the bill was not adopted. However, a year later, a similar bill, introduced by Les, the &quot;Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act, 2007&quot; was introduced and adopted concurrent with federal amendments to the Criminal Code.

Fleming was assigned the role of critic for advanced education. He introduced the &quot;Private Post-Secondary Accountability and Student Protection Act, 2007&quot; which was intended to increase the accountability of private career training institutions and increasing the enforcement abilities of the Degree Quality Assessment Board. He spoke out against deregulation that allowed diploma mills like Rutherford University and Kingston College which advertised to foreign students. He introduced the &quot;Restoring Credibility to Universities Act, 2008&quot; which sought to repeal the &quot;World Trade University Canada Establishment Act&quot; and portions of the 2007 &quot;Education Statutes Amendment Act&quot; concerning private post-secondary institutions. Fleming also took on the role as the NDP tourism critic and objected to Tourism Minister Bill Bennett&#x27;s decision not to participate in the National Vigil Project (a light display honouring Canadians killed World War One) due to costs and, in response to funding cuts to Tourism BC, he criticized government self-promotional advertising.

===39th Parliament===
While his riding was re-aligned to create Victoria-Swan Lake, Fleming easily won re-election facing no opposition for the NDP nomination and receiving 61% of the votes in the May 2009 general election. In the 39th Parliament, his party once again formed the Official Opposition to a BC Liberal majority government. Party leader Carole James assigned him the role of environment critic with the intent of re-casting the party&#x27;s image on environmental issues following the party&#x27;s negatively received campaign plank of repealing the carbon tax. Fleming, and the party, stopped calling for a repeal of the carbon tax and instead emphasized a more nuanced position in providing alternatives which would improve the tax. He linked planned increases in transit fares to global warming and spoke out against fee increases at provincial park campsites.

In November 2009, and again in April 2010, he introduced the &quot;Cosmetic Pesticide and Carcinogen Control Act&quot; which would have prohibited the sale or use of cosmetic pesticides, other than those deemed low-risk. The Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides was struck, with Fleming as deputy chair, to investigate the potential for regulating or banning the use or sale of pesticides used for cosmetic purposes. They first convened in July 2011 and reported in 2012.

In the August 2009 Throne Speech the BC government committed to striking a task force on the topic of species-at-risk, but with no action since then, Fleming introduced his own &quot;Species at Risk Protection Act&quot; in May 2010, based on similar legislation in Ontario. The Minister of Environment Barry Penner responded in June by striking a ten member species-at-risk task force consisting of academics and representatives of industry and non-profit organizations, who were told to make recommendations to directly cabinet. The task force report was submitted in January 2011 but, with the government not making the report public, Fleming re-introduced his legislation in June 2011 the report was made public less than a month later).

In addition, Fleming participated in two committees. In the first two sessions he was deputy chair of the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills, which met once in each session to review private bills. He was member of the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives, the committee that only met twice, both times in September 2010, to deal with a petition seeking the repeal of the Harmonized Sales Tax; Fleming and the three other New Democratic Party members voted to recommend introducing the draft &quot;HST Extinguishment Act&quot; into the Legislative Assembly, while the five BC Liberal members voted to initiate the 2011 British Columbia sales tax referendum.

During the BC NDP leadership election to replace Carole James, Fleming supported Mike Farnworth, though Adrian Dix eventually won. Dix kept Fleming as the critic for Environment. When Parliament re-convened for a fourth session Fleming introduced another private member bill, the &quot;Sustainable Development Indicators and Reporting Act, 2011&quot; which sought to create a Sustainable Development Board to measure and report on indicators of BC&#x27;s economic, environmental and social sustainability.

===40th Parliament===
With the May 2013 election approaching, the 41-year-old Fleming sought re-election in the Victoria-Swan Lake riding. He defeated the BC Liberal candidate, small-business owner Christina Bates, and the BC Green candidate Spencer Malthouse. Despite his win and favourable polling, Fleming&#x27;s party lost the general election and again formed the official opposition. Fleming was critical of party leader Adrian Dix&#x27;s positive-only campaigning during the election, partly blamed for the upset loss, saying that it allowed their opponents to define who they were and then attack that without response. Dix appointed Fleming to the role of education critic, moving his previous role of environment critic to Spencer Chandra Herbert.

Upon Dix&#x27;s resignation as leader of the BC NDP, Fleming was considered as a potential candidate and actively considered seeking the role. However, after both John Horgan and Mike Farnworth announced their intention to run, Fleming decided he would not; he later endorsed Horgan&#x27;s candidacy. Horgan went on to become the leader and kept Fleming in his education critic role.

In December 2015, Fleming fired his constituency assistant who was subsequently arrested, in July 2016, for defrauding the Victoria-Swan Lake constituency office of $120,420 since March 2009. Fleming sponsored the private member bill &quot;Youth Voter Registration Act, 2015&quot; which sought allow provisional voter registration of people between the ages or 16 and 18, one of the recommendations of a 2011 report by the Chief Electoral Officer. The bill was not advanced and he re-introduced it in February 2017 as the &quot;Election (Increasing Youth Participation) Amendment Act, 2017&quot;. The measure was eventually adopted during the 41st Parliament as part of the &quot;Election Amendment Act, 2019&quot;.

===41st Parliament===
For the 2017 general election Fleming was challenged by digital media management consultant Stacey Piercey for the BC Liberal Party, Vancouver medical researcher Chris Maxwell for the Green Party, and David Costigane for the Vancouver Island Party. Fleming was again re-elected with his party forming the Official Opposition, but this time in a BC Liberal minority government. However, in the first session of the 41st Parliament the BC Liberal government lost a confidence vote and the second session began with the BC NDP forming a minority government. In July 2017, Premier John Horgan appointed Fleming Minister of Education in the Executive Council of British Columbia. In that role he oversaw the suspension of in-class learning in the province&#x27;s schools during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; that August he announced the re-opening of schools on September 10, 2020 for the new school year.

===42nd Parliament===
In the October 2020 snap election called by Premier John Horgan, Fleming handily won re-election with more than 59% of the vote. Following a cabinet shuffle on November 26, 2020, he was reassigned to the position of the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, replacing Claire Trevena, the incumbent minister who declined to seek re-election. He was in turn replaced by Jennifer Whiteside as Minister of Education.

In the new cabinet announced by Premier David Eby on December 7, 2022, Fleming retained the post of Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<text>Baade is a lunar impact crater that is located near the southwest limb of the Moon on the near side, to the southwest of the enormous Mare Orientale impact basin. The area to the east of this crater forms the junction between the 280-km-long Vallis Bouvard to the north and the narrower, 160-km-long Vallis Baade to the south-southeast. Both valleys radiate away from the impact basin to the north.

The outer wall of Baade remains sharp-edged, with little appearance of erosion due to subsequent impacts. The rim is generally circular, with some of the inner wall. The crater interior is rough and irregular, with a generally bowl-shaped appearance that lacks a sharply defined floor. There is no central peak at the midpoint of the interior, and no craterlets of note mark the surface.

This crater lies within the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

<text>The São Paulo Railway Company (SPR, nickname &quot;Ingleza&quot;, transl.: &quot;The English&quot;) was a privately owned British railway company in Brazil, which operated the gauge railway from the seaport at Santos via São Paulo to Jundiaí. The company was nationalised in 1946 and became the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí.

The São Paulo Railway consists of three parts:
* The long adhesion railway at the coast from Santos to Piaçaguera near Cubatão
* The long steep grade from Piaçaguera to Paranapiacaba
* The adhesion railway on the plateau from Paranapiacaba via São Paulo to Jundiaí

Three different systems were used to climb the steep grade between Piaçaguera and Paranapiacaba:
* A four section cable railway with stationary steam engines, in use from 1867 till 1970, called &quot;Serra Velha&quot;, transl.: &quot;Old Mountain&quot;
* A five section cable railway with stationary steam engines, in use from 1901 till 1982, called &quot;Serra Nova&quot;, transl.: &quot;New Mountain&quot;
* An electrified rack-and-adhesion railway built on the right of way of the abandoned &quot;Serra Velha&quot; opened in 1974, called &quot;Sistema Cremalheira-Aderência&quot;, transl.: &quot;System Rack-and-adhesion&quot;

== Planning ==

In 1859, a group of people led by the Barão de Mauá convinced the Brazilian government that it was important to construct a railroad connecting São Paulo to the seaport at Santos. The main purpose of the project was the transport of the coffee grown on the inland plateau to the Atlantic coast for export. The biggest difficulty was the task to overcome the steep east slope of the 800-meter high Serra do Mar, which was considered to be nearly impracticable. Therefore, Barão de Mauá asked Britain to clarify the feasibility of a railway line for locomotive hauled trains within a budget limit of 200,000 £. The greatest technician for this subject was consulted: Scottish railroad engineer James Brunlees.

Brunlees visited Brazil and considered that the project was feasible. He recommended engineer Daniel Makinson Fox to Barão de Mauá for the execution of the project. Fox was at that time only 26 years old but had already experience in the construction of railways through the mountains of northern Wales and the hillsides of the Pyrenees. He realised that the railway could only climb the slope in the Serra do Mar if a long incline system was built. An adhesion railway would have used to overcome the slope and would have also overrun the 200,000 £ budget.

== Construction ==

Daniel Fox&#x27;s proposal for the railway line from Santos to Jundiaí including the incline system was approved by Brunlees and the &quot;São Paulo Railway Company&quot; (SPR) was established to build the railway system and operate it for 90 years. Since the capital of the company was mainly British also the official company name was in English, not Portuguese. The railway company contracted with Robert Sharpe &amp; Sons to acquire the land, execute the works and supply all rolling stock and plant.

Construction on the long adhesion railway Santos – Piaçaguera began on 15 March 1860 and on the incline system in the year 1861.

The road was constructed without explosives since it was felt that the slopes were very unstable. The rock was excavated only with plug and feathers. Embankments of in height were constructed to protect the tracks from the frequent torrential rains in the area, which used about rocks. The line did not have any tunnels.

In spite of all the difficulties, the construction finished 10 months ahead of the date specified in the contract, which was eight years. The &quot;São Paulo Railway&quot; was opened on 1867-02-16.

== &quot;Serra Velha&quot; – the first incline system ==
The part of the route climbing the Serra do Mar consisted of four 10.3% grade cable railway sections with the following length: 
* section 1: 
* section 2: 
* section 3: 
* section 4: 

At each section the wagons were attached to a steel wire rope with the help of a specially fitted brake van called &quot;Serrabreque&quot; (transl.: &quot;Hill Brake&quot;). The steel cable was driven by a stationary steam winding engine at the top end of the section, where a extension with a 1.3% grade was also fitted, so that the wagons could be led to the next section.

The incline system was later called &quot;Serra Velha&quot; (transl.: &quot;Old Mountain&quot;) to distinguish it from the later built second incline system called &quot;Serra Nova&quot;.

== &quot;Serra Nova&quot; – the second incline system ==
The large volume of coffee shipments and the growth of the cities in the São Paulo region required more transport capacity. Therefore, the construction of a second incline system started in 1895. The new line ran parallel to the already existing one in about distance. It had five sections using continuous steel wire ropes which were moved by stationary steam engines. Each section was about long and had a grade of 8%. Two to three wagons were coupled to the rope with the help of small locomotives fitted with grip engaging with the cable. These locomotives were also able to handle the wagons in the terminal station and between the sections so that the operation of the incline system was facilitated. The locomotives have been called &quot;Locobreque&quot; (transl.: &quot;Brake locomotives&quot;). In case the weight of the wagons to be lifted was too heavy compared to the wagons lowered at the same time, tank cars filled with water were used to counterbalance the system. The incline system was used in revenue service till 1982.

== Protests ==
In 1889, the first protests were made against the British monopoly over the route to Porto de Santos, which culminated in the construction of &quot;Mairinque–Santos&quot; in 1937, by the .

== Nationalisation ==
On 1946-09-13, the railroad was nationalised by the Brazilian government, and renamed the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí, and on 1948-09-27, it was merged with most of the other Brazilian railways into the &quot;Rede Ferroviária Federal SA&quot; (RFFSA).

==&quot;Sistema Cremalheira-Aderência&quot; – the Rack-and-adhesion railway==
In the 1970s (well after it had been renamed), the haulage system was replaced by an Abt rack system with a maximum gradient of 10.4 %, which was installed by Japanese firm Marubeni. The locomotives for this changeover were constructed by Hitachi with the help of SLM. They work with 3 kV DC supplied by overhead lines.

Starting from 2012, the original Hitachi locomotives were replaced by seven new-built machines supplied by Stadler.

<text>Huddersfield New College is a former grammar school and current sixth form college located in Salendine Nook on the outskirts of Huddersfield, in the county of West Yorkshire, England. On 30 November 2023 the college was assessed as &#x27;Good&#x27; following an OFSTED review

Huddersfield New College is situated to the west of the town, on &quot; New Hey Road&quot; (A640) less than a mile from junction 23 of the M62. It should not be confused with Huddersfield Technical College, which became Kirklees College in 2008.

In 2019 the college was recognised as the TES 6th Form College of the Year.

==History==
===Huddersfield College ===
Huddersfield College was founded in 1839. Henry Ernest Atkins, the chess master, was principal from 1909 to 1936.

===Huddersfield New College as a boys grammar school===

Huddersfield New College was founded in 1958 when the existing Huddersfield College was merged with Hillhouse Technical School to form a new boys&#x27; grammar school at a new campus at Salendine Nook with 950 boys. In 1959, the girls-only Longley Technical High School moved to the campus, with a new school called Huddersfield High School also on New Hey Road with 700 girls run by Huddersfield Education Committee. Princess Margaret opened the girls&#x27; school on the campus on 14 November 1958. The whole site, including Salendine Nook High School, had cost £1 million. Sir Edward Boyle opened Huddersfield New College on 26 March 1958.

The last admission of 11-year-olds was in 1972, and the college then began a gradual transition from a boys only grammar school to a co-educational sixth form college. During the dissolution of the grammar schools under Harold Wilson&#x27;s watch (an old boy of the nearby Royds Hall Grammar School), he infamously said that &quot;grammar schools would be dismantled over his dead body&quot;. However the sixth form college has retained much of the academic-minded ethos of his former school.

===Huddersfield New College as a co-educational sixth form college===
It became a sixth form college when the two grammar schools, Huddersfield New College and Huddersfield High School, gradually merged from 1973. In 1974 it was administered by Kirklees Metropolitan Council until 1993 when funded by the FEFC. In 2001 it was administered by West Yorkshire LSC, whose executive director was Margaret Coleman, a former principal of the college.

==Buildings==
More recently, the eastern half of the original 1958 built building has been demolished, and replaced with a modern construction grafted onto the remaining half of the original building.

In January 2007 building works commenced to expand the current school to increase capacity. New buildings will house additional classrooms for Geography, Art, Psychology, Textiles, Modern Languages, IT, Media Studies and a new student dining area (known as the IT Café by students). Additional expansion to &#x27;The Boiler House&#x27; – the current performing arts area is also commencing, yielding increased classrooms a recording studio and a new theatre. There has also been expansion to the sports centre, which now houses: Sports Studies, Travel and Tourism, Sociology, Health and Social Care, Children&#x27;s Learning, Care and Development. Also a large gym with state-of-the-art equipment, and a large sports hall.

In September 2012 the college completed the construction of a £100,000 3G AstroTurf pitch which is also used by the neighbouring Salendine Nook High School.

==Academic performance==
In October 2011 the college was formally inspected by Ofsted, who praised the college and rated it as &quot;a good college with outstanding features&quot;. Ofsted said that the college was showing a lot of improvement year-on-year and that the quality of teaching across all areas was good. All courses have high success rates, and students enjoy their time at the college.

On 17 May 2016 the college was assessed as &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; in all 6 inspection domains following an OFSTED review. They are the first Sixth Form College to receive such an accolade under the new (September 2016) inspection framework.

<doc id="1055777" wikidata="Q16993940" url="?curid=1055777" title="Gandy dancer">
<text>Gandy dancer is a slang term used for early railroad workers in the United States, more formally referred to as &quot;section hands&quot;, who laid and maintained railroad tracks in the years before the work was done by machines.
The British equivalents of the term &quot;gandy dancer&quot; are &quot;navvy&quot; (from &quot;navigator&quot;), originally builders of canals, or &quot;inland navigations&quot;, for builders of railway lines, and &quot;platelayer&quot; for workers employed to inspect and maintain the track. In the Southwestern United States and Mexico, Mexican and Mexican-American track workers were colloquially &quot;traqueros&quot;.

In the United States, early section crews were often made up of recent immigrants and ethnic minorities who vied for steady work despite poor wages and working conditions, and hard physical labor. The Chinese, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans in the Western United States, the Irish in the Midwestern United States, African Americans in the Southern United States, and East Europeans and Italians in the Northeastern United States all worked as gandy dancers.

There are various theories about the derivation of the term, but most refer to the &quot;dancing&quot; movements of the workers using a specially manufactured &quot;lining&quot; bar, which came to be called a &quot;gandy&quot;, as a lever to keep the tracks in alignment.

== Etymology ==
The term has an uncertain origin. A majority of early northern railway workers were Irish, so an Irish or Gaelic derivation for the English term seems possible.

Others have suggested that the term gandy dancer was coined to describe the movements of the workers themselves, i.e., the constant &quot;dancing&quot; motion of the track workers as they lunged against their tools in unison to nudge the rails, often timed by a chant; as they carried rails; or, speculatively, as they waddled like ganders while running on the railroad ties.

But most researchers have identified a &quot;Gandy Shovel Company&quot; or, variously, &quot;Gandy Manufacturing Company&quot; or &quot;Gandy Tool Company&quot; reputed to have existed in Chicago as the source of the tools from which gandy dancers took their name. Some sources even list the goods manufactured by the company, i.e., &quot;tamping bars, claw bars, picks, and shovels.&quot; But others have cast doubt on the existence of such a company. The Chicago Historical Society has been asked for information on the company so many times that they have said, &quot;It&#x27;s like a legend,&quot; but they have never been able to find a Gandy company in their old records.

== History ==
Though rail tracks were held in place by wooden ties (&quot;sleepers&quot; outside the U.S. and Canada) and the mass of the crushed rock (&quot;ballast&quot;) beneath them, each pass of a train around a curve, through centripetal force and vibration, produces a tiny shift in the tracks, requiring that work crews periodically realign the track. If allowed to accumulate, such shifts could eventually cause a derailment. 
For each stroke, a worker would lift his lining bar (gandy) and force it into the ballast to create a fulcrum, then throw himself forward using the bar to check his full weight (making the &quot;huh&quot; sound recorded in the lyrics below) so the bar would push the rail toward the inside of the curve. 

The process is explained at the &quot;Encyclopedia Alabama&quot; folklore section:

&quot;Each workman carried a lining bar, a straight pry bar with a sharp end. The thicker bottom end was square-shafted (to fit against the rail) and shaped to a chisel point (to dig down into the gravel underneath the rail); the lighter top end was rounded (for better gripping). When lining track, each man would face one of the rails and work the chisel end of his lining bar down at an angle into the ballast under it. Then all would take a step toward their rail and pull up and forward on their pry bars to lever the track—rails, crossties and all—over and through the ballast.&quot;

Workers also needed to periodically level the track by jacking it up in the low spots. Standing shoulder to shoulder, they raised the track with square-ended picks and pushed ballast under the railroad ties. Even with repeated impacts from the work crew of eight, ten, or more, any progress made in shifting the track would not become visible until after a large number of repetitions.

As maintenance of way workers, besides lining bars gandy dancers also used special sledge hammers called spike mauls to drive spikes, shovels or ballast forks to move track ballast, large clamps called &quot;rail dogs&quot; to carry rails, and ballast tamper bars or picks to adjust the ballast. The same ground crews also performed the other aspects of track maintenance, such as removing weeds, unloading ties and rails, and replacing worn rails and rotten ties. The work was extremely difficult and the pay was low, but it was one of the only jobs available for southern black men and newly arriving immigrants at that time. Black men working on the railroad were held in high esteem among their peers. There&#x27;s a blues song that says &quot;when you marry, marry a railroad man, every day Sunday, a dollar in your hand.&quot;

=== Early economic circumstance of maintenance of way employees ===

In 1918, in an article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; about the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Robert W. Bruere explained the economic circumstances that sometimes drove gandy dancers and other itinerant workers to join that organization:
The division superintendent of a great Western railroad recently explained to me his reluctant part in the creation of the socially disintegrating conditions out of which the migratory workers and the rebellious propaganda of the I. W. W. have sprung. &quot;The men down East,&quot; he said, &quot;the men who have invested their money in our road, measure our administrative efficiency by money return—by net earnings and dividends. Many of our shareholders have never seen the country our road was built to serve; they get their impression of it and of its people, not from living contact with men, but from the impersonal ticker. They judge us by quotations and the balance-sheet. The upshot is that we have to keep expenses cut close as a jailbird&#x27;s hair. Take such a detail as the maintenance of ways, for example—the upkeep of tracks and road-beds. This work should be going on during the greater part of the year. But to keep costs down, we have crowded it into four months. It is impossible to get the number and quality of men we need by the offer of a four months&#x27; job. So we publish advertisements broadcast that read something like this:

:::&quot;Men Wanted! High Wages!&quot;
:::&quot;Permanent Employment!&quot;

&quot;We know when we put our money into these advertisements that they are— well, part of a pernicious system of sabotage. We know that we are not going to give permanent employment. But we lure men with false promises, and they come. At the end of four months we lay them off, strangers in a strange country, many of them thousands of miles from their old homes. We wash our hands of them. They come with golden dreams, expecting in many cases to build homes, rear families, become substantial American citizens. After a few weeks, their savings gone, the single men grow restless and start moving; a few weeks more and the married men bid their families good-by. They take to the road hunting for jobs, planning to send for their families when they find steady work. Some of them swing onto the freight-trains and beat their way to the nearest town, are broke when they get there, find the labor market oversupplied, and, as likely as not, are thrown into jail as vagrants. Some of them hit the trail for the woods, the ranches, and the mines. Many of them never find a stable anchorage again; they become hobos, vagabonds, wayfarers—migratory and intermittent workers, outcasts from society and the industrial machine, ripe for the denationalized fellowship of the I. W. W.&quot; Bruere concluded, &quot;[t]his is a small but characteristic example of a vast system of human exploitation that has been developed by the powerful suction of our headlong industrial expansion...&quot;

Black historian and journalist Thomas Fleming began his career as a bellhop and then spent five years as a cook for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In a weekly series of articles he wrote of his memories of the Mexican section hands in the 1920s and 30s. He recalled that the Southern Pacific gave them a place to sleep: old boxcars converted into two-room cabins. The company would take old boxcars, remove the wheels, and lay them alongside the tracks. He remembers that the workers had a lot of children who attended the public schools, but the ones he met during his childhood were &quot;kind of meek, and took a lot of abuse from the other kids&quot;. Fleming says that &quot;you found them right outside of all towns in California; that was part of the landscape.&quot; He suggests that they may have been the only ones who were willing to do the job because they got the lowest pay of any railroad workers, only about $40 a month.

During the early 1940s when the U.S. was involved in the fighting of World War II, the days of Rosie the Riveter, a few women worked as gandy dancers. During the war years so many of the men were away that the U.S. developed a severe labor shortage and women stepped in to do what, to that time, had been done exclusively by men. A 1988 article in &quot;The Valley Gazette&quot; carried the story of several local women who had worked on the Reading Railroad in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania as gandy dancers. In an interview one of the women, Mary Gbur, said that it was the money, about $55 a week, that had attracted her to the job: “Money was short and I wanted to help my children continue their education after high school. And the railroad beat the $18 a week the dime store paid.” Gbur called the work &quot;gruesome and boring&quot; and apparently it was seen by the townspeople as degrading for a woman to be doing manual labor, leaving the women feeling embarrassed about the work they were doing. However, she said, &quot;One day attitudes changed when a voice boomed out, &#x27;I am sure proud of you ladies!&#x27;&quot; The voice was that of the village priest.

=== Early use of term ===

Michael Quinion identified the first known (printed) use of the term gandy dancer as 1918, but with so little understanding of the origin of the term it is impossible to know when it came into being. An article in the May 1918 edition of the weekly publication The Outlook (New York) asks the question:

:What is a &quot;gandy dancer&quot;? The words were on a blackboard outside a store on the Bowery. In old times they might have suggested the proximity of a cheap dance house. But the Bowery has changed. Within the space of a few blocks there are now more than a score of &quot;labor bureaus&quot; where formerly were low dives and &quot;suicide halls&quot;. Inquiry of an Italian employee of the bureau elicited the information that a &quot;gandy dancer&quot; is a railway worker who tamps down the earth between the ties, or otherwise &quot;dances&quot; on the track. The announcement read:

::Men wanted for track work cinder ballast no rock straight time rain or shine paid weekly accommodation very good. Board furnished $5 per week. It is a good job particularly for veteran gandy dancers. It&#x27;s a few miles out and requires no weeks toil to get back to this burg.

A story published in the August 1931 edition of Boys&#x27; Life, a monthly magazine of the Boy Scouts of America for boys 6 to 18, mentions the term &quot;gandy&quot;. In the story, &quot;Eddie Parker&quot;, about 17 or 18 years old and characterized as the all-American type, takes on a job as a worker in a railway section crew. His new co-workers are all Italian immigrants, or, as referred to in the story, &quot;snipes&quot;. The &quot;snipes&quot; are characterized as lazy, stupid, and lovers of garlic, olive oil, and Italian music. &quot;Eddie&quot; figures a way to get the Italians to work at pumping the hand car – used to get to and from the section the crew would be working on that day – by using their love of music. He explains that he &quot;hooked a grind organ onto the under frame and attached the handle to the axle crank..,[and] whenever the axel turns the handle has to follow it.&quot; Throughout the story, the workers are referred to as section crew workers, but the hand-car is referred to as a &quot;gandy&quot;.

In the 1960s Maintenance of Way laborers were still being called &quot;gandy dancers&quot; by track foremen in Oregon, and the tamping rod was called a &quot;gandy pole&quot; by most or simply a &quot;gandy&quot;.

== Songs and chants ==
While most southern railroad maintenance workers were African American, gandy dancers were not strictly southern or African American. Section crews were often made up of recent immigrants and ethnic minorities who vied for steady work despite poor wages and working conditions, and hard physical labor. The Chinese, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans in the West, the Irish in the Midwest, and East Europeans and Italians in the Northeast laid and maintained track as well. Though all gandy dancers sang railroad songs, it may be that black gandy dancers, with a long tradition of using song to coordinate work, were unique in their use of task-related work chants.

Rhythm was necessary both to synchronize the manual labor, and to maintain the morale of workers. Work songs and hollers sung in a call-and-response format were used to coordinate the various aspects of all rail maintenance; slower speech-like &quot;dogging&quot; calls to direct the picking up and manipulating of the steel rails and unloading, hauling and stacking of the ties, and more rhythmic songs for spiking and lining (aligning) the rails and tamping the bed of ballast beneath them.

In 1939 John Lomax recorded a number of railroad songs which contain an example of an &quot;unloading steel rails&quot; call; it is available at the American Memory site.

There is no doubt that country singer Jimmie Rodgers was influenced by the working songs of the gandy dancers. His father, a section foreman in Meridian, Mississippi, brought his son with him to work as a water boy where he would have been exposed to their musical chants. Rodgers went on to be known as the &quot;Singing Brakeman&quot; and the Father of Country Music.

Anne Kimzey of the Alabama Center For Traditional Culture writes: &quot;All-black gandy dancer crews used songs and chants as tools to help accomplish specific tasks and to send coded messages to each other so as not to be understood by the foreman and others. The lead singer, or caller, would chant to his crew, for example, to realign a rail to a certain position. His purpose was to uplift his crew, both physically and emotionally, while seeing to the coordination of the work at hand. It took a skilled, sensitive caller to raise the right chant to fit the task at hand and the mood of the men. Using tonal boundaries and melodic style typical of the blues, each caller had his own signature. The effectiveness of a caller to move his men has been likened to how a preacher can move a congregation.&quot; Typical songs featured a two-line, four-beat couplet to which members of the gang would tap their lining bars against the rails until the men were in perfect time and then the caller would call for a hard pull on the third beat of a four-beat chant. Veteran section gangs lining track, especially with an audience, often embellished their work with a one-handed flourish and with one foot stepping out and back on beats four, one, and two, between the two-armed pulls on the lining bars on beat three. USC-Columbia has a vintage gandy dancer video which demonstrates the singing, dancing-like rhythm, lining tool, and a very large crew.

=== Documentary ===

In 1994, folklorist Maggie Holtzberg, working as a folklore fieldworker to document traditional folk music in Alabama, produced a documentary film &quot;Gandy Dancers&quot;. Holtzberg relates,
:&quot;Knowing that the occupational art of calling was fast receding into the collective memories of railroad retirees, I was motivated to locate individuals and document what I could of their passive repertoire of work song lore, before it was lost. At the start, I contacted railroad company officials. When I asked about finding gandy dancers to talk to, there was often a short pause and then a perplexed comment as to how I knew of this arcane tradition. One man laughed and told me I would need to contact a medium since the use of section gangs was abolished in the 1960s. There were, however, some encouraging leads. An owner of a railroad maintenance company remembered &quot;one caller with a real high pitched voice who could go ten hours a day and never repeat a chant.&quot; He agreed that it was important to document what remained of the calling tradition but said, &#x27;One man couldn&#x27;t begin to explain the process of lining track. You would have to get a crew together to do it,&#x27; which, in the end, was exactly what we did.&quot;

It had been many years since modern machinery had replaced section crews, so Holtzberg spoke with older or retired roadmasters who might remember the callers, or know where they might be living. She managed to locate a number of callers and interviewed them in their homes. However, the men found it difficult to call track in their living room as opposed to being out on the track with the sound of rapping lining bars to call against. They met at a nearby railroad club that was rebuilding a depot museum. In this familiar environment the men quickly began to remember the old calls, and especially so when a train passed by blowing its whistle. Holtzberg recalls the words of John Cole, at 82 the oldest of the men:

:&quot;Listen to that train. Yeah! That&#x27;s a train! The hawk and buzzard went up north . . . You hear it blowing. I got a gal live behind the jail . . . That&#x27;s a train . . . all it took was that noise.&quot; The train whistle blew and dopplered down in pitch.

The film was completed in 1994 and is available at the Folkstreams website. The trailer for the film is available at YouTube.

=== Typical call lyrics ===
The caller simultaneously motivated and entertained the men and set the timing through work songs that derived distantly from call and response traditions brought from Africa and sea shanties, and more recently from cotton-chopping songs, blues, and African-American church music. A good caller could go on all day without ever repeating a call. The caller needed to know the best calls to suit a particular crew or occasion. Sometimes calls with a religious theme were used and other times calls that would evoke sexual imagery were in order. An example:

:I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;ve been told
:Susie has a jelly roll
:I don&#x27;t know...huh
:But I&#x27;ve been told...huh
:Susie has...huh
:A jelly roll...huh

In these calls the men begin to tap their gandy against the rail during the first two lines to get in rhythm and unison. Then with each &quot;huh&quot; grunt the men throw their weight forward on their gandy to slowly bring the rail back into alignment.

:Up and down this road I go
:Skippin&#x27; and dodging a 44
:Hey man won&#x27;t you line &#x27;um...huh
:Hey won&#x27;t you line &#x27;um...huh
:Hey won&#x27;t you line &#x27;um...huh
:Hey won&#x27;t you line &#x27;um...huh

Retired gandy dancer John Cole explained spike driving songs in the documentary &quot;Gandy Dancers&quot;.

:&quot;So gandy dancing goes in with the music. That&#x27;s the way it’s been since way back. In the beginning of the railroad, you had to line it up. That’s where the gandy dancers come in. And you even gandy danced behind a maul. Even spiking, you make the spike maul talk; you sing to it. Like when you’re driving a spike down. [SINGING] “Big cat, little cat, teeniny kitten. Big cat!” That’s you driving the spike as hard as you could. He’d holler, “Make a wheel out of that maul.” And that means spike fast. And so, with two of us spiking, you make that maul talk! “Big cat, little cat, teeniny kitten,” and that spike would be down.&quot;

In 1996 two former callers, John Henry Mealing and Cornelius Wright, received National Heritage Fellowship awards as &quot;Master Folk and Traditional Artists&quot; for their demonstrations of this form of African-American folk art.

=== Military cadence calls ===

In the armed services, a military cadence call, also known as a Jody call, is a traditional call-and-response work song sung by military personnel while running or marching. As a sort of work song, military cadences take their rhythms from the work being done. Many cadences have a call and response structure wherein one soldier initiates a line and the remaining soldiers complete it, thus instilling teamwork and camaraderie for completion. Like lining calls, they also serve to mock one&#x27;s superiors, vent anger and frustration, relieve boredom, and to boost spirits by poking fun or boasting.

It is believed that Private Willie Lee Duckworth Sr., who was stationed at Fort Slocum, New York as one of eight “Colored Infantrymen” in 1944, made up “Sound Off”, also known as the “Duckworth Chant”, which is used to this day in the U.S.Army and other branches of the military. Media researcher Barry Dornfeld, who co-authored the documentary &quot;Gandy Dancer&quot;, believes that
Duckworth&#x27;s military cadence calls were influenced by his familiarity with track lining calls. Dornfeld writes, &quot;I recently uncovered a connection between the southern African American tradition of call-and-response works songs and military cadence calls used in drill training, popularly known as “Jody calls.” 

Duckworth, who was born in 1924 in Washington County, Georgia, would have been familiar with the use of work chants sung for all kinds of agricultural work. He was also the same generation of the gandy dancers who used chants to line track. At the time he was drafted to serve in WW II, Duckworth was working in a sawmill. He was sent to a provisional training center in Fort Slocum, N.Y., in March 1944. As the story goes, Duckwork, on orders from a non-commissioned officer, improvised his own drill for the soldiers in his unit. Soon after, all the ranks were buzzing and keeping rhythm. Col. Bernard Lentz, who was the base commander at the Fort, approached Duckworth and asked where he developed his unique chant. “I told him it came from calling hogs back home,” Duckworth said. “I was scared, and that was the only thing I could think of to say.”

== Popular culture ==

The Gandy Dancer State Trail is a 47-mile rail trail for hiking, biking and other recreational uses, that follows the old Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie railroad grade from St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, through a bit of eastern Minnesota and terminating in Superior Wisconsin.

&quot;The Gandy Dancers&#x27; Ball&quot; is a song recorded by Frankie Laine in 1951, but with gandy dancers as actual dancers at a railroad workers&#x27; ball. Laine sang it with a chorus of dancers in the 1955 comedy film &quot;Bring Your Smile Along&quot;.

In 1962, The Ventures recorded the song &quot;Gandy Dancer&quot;, an original instrumental composition that was released on their album &quot;Going to the Ventures Dance Party&quot;.

Singer/political activist Bruce &quot;Utah&quot; Phillips, in &quot;Moose Turd Pie&quot;, told a tall tale of working as a gandy dancer in the American southwest. Phillips ascribed the source of the workers&#x27; shovels to the possibly mythical Gandy Shovel Company of Chicago.

Gandy dancers are celebrated in The Gandy Dancer Festival, in Mazomanie, Wisconsin.

The Ann Arbor (Michigan) railroad station was converted into a restaurant called the Gandy Dancer.

Folk singer Huddie Ledbetter (aka Lead Belly), sang about the work of the gandy dancer in the lyrics of an unaccompanied work song, &quot;Linin&#x27; Track&quot;. It has since been recorded by many others, including Dave &quot;Snaker&quot; Ray and Taj Mahal.

The bassist Fred Turner of the rock group Bachman-Turner Overdrive wrote a song called &quot;Little Gandy Dancer&quot; that appeared on the group&#x27;s first album in 1973.

In the 2005 point-and-click adventure game, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, a series of achievable titles could be obtained by performing various actions. One of these titles was the &#x27;Gandy Dancer&#x27;, bestowed on players for demonstrating their effective dance routines.

<text>Greenhead College is a sixth form college, and former grammar school, located in Huddersfield, in the county of West Yorkshire, England. The current principal is Mo Bunter. With over 2,700 students, it is a large sixth form college, attracting students from as far afield as Wakefield, Manchester, Barnsley, Bradford, Leeds, Halifax, Wetherby and even Wales. It is located next to Greenhead Park which is one of the largest parks in Huddersfield.

==History==
===Grammar school===
Greenhead High School for Girls was founded in 1909. The last O-levels were taken in June 1977. The girls grammar school incrementally became a sixth form college, from September 1973.

Graham Cooksey moved from Thomas Rotherham College to be headmaster from January 1973.

===Sixth form college===
It was a full sixth form college from September 1977.

==Reputation==
The college topped both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s A level college league tables in 2006. It came fourth in 2007 and sixth in 2008. It was also the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;&#x27;s Sixth Form College of the Year, 2014-15.

==Subject choices==
Students usually study 3 subjects at A level. There are over 30 different subjects for students to study.

==Admissions==
Students from partnership feeder schools are given priority for places at the college, and are required to obtain a minimum of GCSE grades 4 in Maths and English language in addition to three GCSE grade 6s to gain a place at the college. Some subjects have more specific entry requirements.

Current partner schools are All Saints Catholic High School, Newsome High School, Almondbury High School and Language College, Colne Valley High School, North Huddersfield Trust School, Holmfirth High School, Honley High School, King James&#x27;s School, Moor End Technology College, Netherhall Learning Campus, Royds Hall Academy and Salendine Nook High School.

Students from other schools are considered based on their mock GCSE results, a one-to-one interview and the availability of subject places, this after partner school students have been taken into consideration. Students from the Calderdale secondary schools, including The Brooksbank School, The Crossley Heath School and North Halifax Grammar School, can be accepted through the application process. In 2005, then-principal Martin Rostron said he believed the college has been criticised for selecting only the best students, which he denied, saying that Greenhead took those of all abilities.

==Campus==

The Greenhead College campus is on one site, near the centre of Huddersfield, directly next to Greenhead park.

The college has approximately 8 main buildings, all of which are internally linked. Each building represents a subject or a group of similar subjects. On 26 May 2004, the college officially opened a new building on the campus, the Conway Building. The building was dedicated to the former principal, Dr Kevin Conway.

The college has a small football field on site and a small hockey field. Two tennis courts were replaced in early 2012 to make way for a new maths and science building, opened by the Duke of Kent. Many enrichments (extra curricular activities) offered by the college are done off campus due to the lack of outdoor space owing to the proximity to Huddersfield town centre.

==Redevelopment==
In 2008 Ryder Architecture were commissioned to draw up plan for a new project with would provide a series of new buildings which were linked to the existing buildings via a central atrium hub. These buildings provided educational classrooms as well as various support and ancillary accommodation. The existing site was constrained with several existing buildings which would have caused a complex phased construction process. It was estimated that the project would cost approximately £15 million.

In December 2008 a report examining the feasibility of the project was approved by the college. An application was submitted to the Learning and Skills Council in July 2009 with construction works commencing January 2010 for a duration of 2 years. Unfortunately LSC funding was not received and the project was placed on hold until alternative funding could be sourced.

In November 2023 the college opened its new &#x27;Hirst&#x27; building, named after former alumni and now biological scientist Judy Hirst. The Hirst building is a £25 million project funded by the Department for Education and built in collaboration between construction companies Galliford Try and Mace. Whilst the building is now open, work to connect the main building with the other buildings on site continues, along with construction and landscaping of an outdoor social space which should be complete by late Summer 2025.

The Hirst building provides facilities for the teaching of chemistry, biology, psychology and government and politics. These subjects relocated from the old Langsplain building, which was demolished as a result of the decant. There are also large study and social areas with new catering facilities. The building is also carbon-neutral and features a bio roof and solar panels to generate electricity for the building.
==Extracurricular activities==
Greenhead is well praised for its enrichment programmes which encourages pupils to partake in extracurricular activities designed to build students character, their personal, sporting and social interests and prepares them more effectively both for higher education and future employment. It was first introduced in 1990. Its most recent praise was from Ofsted in 2011 from their spot check report.

Enrichment is mandatory for student to undertake, this encourages pupils to partake supporting the programs success. There are a huge variety of courses for students to choose form including The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, sports, music and drama, information technology, voluntary services and The World Challenge; additionally students are free to start new courses on the proviso they can gain enough support for them. In 2011 a total of 79 different courses were available to students including 22 different sporting activates such as badminton, basketball, cycling, football (men and women’s), rugby (men and women’s), judo and squash and 9 different music groups. Alongside a variety of enrichment activities offered as part of the college programme, the music department offers annual opportunities for students across Kirklees to perform and compose. In 2018, the Greenhead College &#x27;Carol for Yorkshire&#x27; raised over £700 for charity, and 2021 is the inaugural year of the Greenhead New Music Competition. Taster sessions are provided so that students can make informed decisions.

As part of the enrichment program, pupils must take part in the college &#x27;Step Into&#x27; programme in their first year. Work shadowing placements include medical, political, scientific and language based jobs, usually at a senior level within the respective companies. If a pupil does not wish to do work shadowing, many projects, from circus skills to mathematical art, are available.

==Awards==
* Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in 1996
* The Educational Institution of the Year Award in 1999
* The Beacon College Award in May 1999, and again in September 2004
* The Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Excellence in 2000 (for the second time)

<doc id="1055788" wikidata="Q8032910" url="?curid=1055788" title="Woodlands, Glasgow">
<text>Woodlands is an area of Glasgow, Scotland. Situated on the north-west edge of the city centre, Woodlands is located within Glasgow&#x27;s fashionable West End, east of Hillhead, south of Woodside, north of the Park District and Kelvingrove Park, and west of Charing Cross and Garnethill.

Woodlands has a substantial population of residents of Pakistani and Indian heritage, as well as a large number of students. The area is in the vicinity of the University of Glasgow and Glasgow School of Art. The housing stock mostly consists of 19th century terraces, townhouses, and blonde and red sandstone tenement housing, with modern redevelopment which is also predominantly in the tenement style.

== History ==

The area of flat land on the east bank of the River Kelvin was used as an industrial area. From at least the early 1600s, the site was the location of a watermill which processed grain. In 1790, William Gillespie constructed Glasgow&#x27;s first and only water driven cotton mill, with bleach and print fields also located in the vicinity. As part of the Blythswood Estate, Woodlands was officially incorporated into the city of Glasgow in 1830.

In 2021, Woodlands was the location of the Murder of Esther Brown.

== Points of interest ==
Woodlands is home to the Arlington Baths Club. The club is located on Arlington Street. Burnbank Park, which was situated on what is now Barrington Drive, was the home of the Caledonian Cricket Club, and was the home ground of Rangers F.C. from September 1875 to March 1876.

49 West Princes Street was the home of Marion Gilchrist, the victim in the famous Oscar Slater case.

There is a statue erected in the memory of Bud Neill on the corner of Woodlands Road and Woodlands Gate.

== Public transport ==
Public transport includes Kelvinbridge and St George&#x27;s Cross Subway stations, located respectively at the western and eastern extremes of the district, as well as numerous bus routes along Great Western and Woodlands Roads.

<text>Babbage is an ancient lunar impact crater that is located near the northwest limb of the Moon, named after Charles Babbage. It is attached to the southeastern rim of the prominent crater Pythagoras. The crater remnant named South intrudes into the southeastern floor of Babbage.

The outer rim of Babbage has been eroded and modified by a multitude of subsequent impacts, until all that remains is a ring of rounded hills. The most notable of these modifications is the satellite crater Babbage D, which overlays the southwestern rim. The northeast rim of this satellite crater is missing, and it forms a bay on the perimeter of Babbage. Oenopides is another worn formation attached to the southwest edge of this protuberance.

The outer of Pythagoras lies across the floor of Babbage, forming a region of rough terrain in the northwest part of the interior. The remainder of the crater floor is relatively flat, although it is marked by many tiny craterlets. The most notable feature on the floor is the satellite crater Babbage A, which lies in the southeast part of the interior. This feature has not been significantly worn, and appears much younger than the remainder of the formation. Just to the west of Babbage A is the smaller Babbage C, a bowl-shaped formation.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Babbage.

<text>Naganagani (Compagnie Nationale Naganagani) was a state-owned airline based in Burkina Faso. It was founded in 1984 and launched operations with a single cargo Boeing 707 jet registered as XT-ABX. In the airline&#x27;s final years, the plane was operated on behalf of Air Afrique. An extra passenger-configured 707, XT-ABZ, joined the company in 1987. In 1989 a third 707, XT-BBF, was purchased for use as a presidential aircraft.

<text>DSTN (double super twisted nematic), also known as dual-scan super twisted nematic or simply dual-scan, is an LCD technology in which a screen is divided in half, which are simultaneously refreshed giving faster refresh rate than traditional passive matrix screens. It is an improved form of supertwist nematic display that offers low power consumption but inferior sharpness and brightness compared to TFT screens. 

== History ==
For several years (early 1990s to early 2000s), TFT screens were only found in high-end laptops due to them being more expensive and lower-end laptops offering DSTN screens only. This was at a time when the screen was often the most expensive component of laptops. The price difference between a laptop with DSTN and one with TFT could easily be $400 or more. However, TFT gradually became cheaper and essentially captured the entire market, before being replaced with IPS (itself in the process of being replaced with OLED, starting with high-end).

DSTN display quality is poor compared to TFT, with visible noise, smearing, much lower contrast and slow response. Such screens are unsuitable for viewing movies or playing video games of any kind.

<doc id="1055799" wikidata="Q1092939" url="?curid=1055799" title="Titular church">
<text>In the Catholic Church, a titular church () is a church in Rome that is assigned to a member of the clergy who is created a cardinal. These are Catholic churches in the city, within the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rome, that serve as honorary designations symbolising the relationship of cardinals to the pope, the bishop of Rome. According to the 1983 Code of Canon Law, a cardinal may assist his titular church through counsel or through patronage, although &quot;he has no power of governance over it, and he should not for any reason interfere in matters concerning the administration of its good, or its discipline, or the service of the church&quot;.

There are two ranks of titular churches: titles and deaconries. A title () is a titular church that is assigned to a cardinal priest (a member of the second order of the College of Cardinals), whereas a deaconry () is normally assigned to a cardinal deacon (a member of the third order of the college). If a cardinal priest or a cardinal deacon is later appointed a cardinal bishop (a member of the first order of the college), he is typically transferred from his titular church to the vacant title of a suburbicarian diocese in the vicinity of Rome. Patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches who are created cardinal bishops are not assigned titles of suburbicarian dioceses.

A cardinal may request that he be transferred to another titular church in a consistory; in addition, when a cardinal deacon opts to become a cardinal priest (usually after ten years), he may request either that his deaconry be elevated &quot;pro hac vice&quot; (&#x27;for this occasion&#x27;) to a title or that he be transferred from his deaconry to a vacant title. Other churches in Rome can also be established as new titular churches. Occasionally, a titular church may be held &quot;in commendam&quot; (&#x27;in trust&#x27;) by a cardinal who has been transferred to a different titular church or to a suburbicarian diocese.

== History ==
Before the legalization of Christianity in Rome the &quot;tituli&quot; were private buildings used as Christian churches—also called &quot;domus ecclesiae&quot; or &quot;house churches&quot;—and each took the name of the owner of the building, either a wealthy donor, or a priest appointed by the Church authorities to run it. For instance, the , now the church of the Santi Quattro Coronati, drew its name from its foundress, who doubtless owned the extensive suburban Roman villa whose foundations remain under the church and whose audience hall became the ecclesiastical basilica. The most ancient reference to such a Roman church is in the &quot;Apology against the Arians&quot; of Athanasius in the fourth century, which speaks of a council of bishops assembled &quot;in the place where the Priest Vitus held his congregation&quot;.

By the end of the 5th century such churches numbered 25, as is confirmed by the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;. The same number, though with different identities, is given in the reports of councils held in Rome in 499 and 595. In 1120, however, the number is given as 28. In modern times, many more have received the status of &quot;tituli&quot; or titular churches, while others over the centuries have been abandoned. Some of the latter have been demolished by natural events, war or urban development.

In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees, the priests in charge of the &quot;tituli&quot; churches, and the clergy in charge of the deaconries. These were known collectively as the cardinals. Given the importance of this privilege, the term &quot;cardinal&quot; came to be understood as bestowing high rank.

Accordingly, when it became customary to attribute for honorific reasons the title of cardinal to ecclesiastics living outside Rome, each was assigned theoretical responsibility for one or other of the Roman churches, a legal fiction establishing their position within the Pope&#x27;s diocese of Rome. It was understood that they had no obligation to reside in Rome, and so were not personally responsible for the pastoral care of the titular churches assigned to them. This practice is still in force today.

== Present situation ==
Today, the cardinal priests have a loose patronal relationship with their titular churches, whose cardinal protector they are called. Their names and coats of arms are inscribed on plaques in the churches, they are expected to preach at the church occasionally when they are in Rome, and many raise funds for their church&#x27;s maintenance and restoration, but they no longer participate in the actual management of the churches. There are (as of 2015) 160 presbyteral titular churches.

Many cardinals are assigned to &quot;tituli&quot; with some connection to their home see or country, such as the national churches in Rome. For example, Jean-Claude Turcotte, former archbishop of Montreal, was made Cardinal Priest of the Santi Martiri Canadesi (Holy Canadian Martyrs); André Vingt-Trois, former Archbishop of Paris, is the cardinal priest of San Luigi dei Francesi (St. Louis, King of France).

== Cardinal deacons ==
In the wider sense, the term &quot;titular church&quot; is also loosely applied to the &quot;deaconries&quot; in Rome assigned to the cardinal-deacons.
Originally, a &quot;deaconry&quot; was a charitable institution in Christian Rome, first mentioned in connection with Pope Benedict II (684–685). It would seem that in an early period there were seven deaconries, each corresponding to one of the seven divisions of the city. As the terms implies, each was entrusted to a deacon. Pope Adrian I (772–795) fixed their number at 18, a number that remained constant until the 16th century.

Since the medieval period, men appointed cardinal deacons are often holders of high office in the Roman Curia. However, there have also been some recent developments since it was established that cardinals over the age of 80 would not participate in the conclave that elects a new Pope. Despite this new rule, the Popes have continued to appoint as cardinals a limited number of priests or bishops who have already reached 80 years of age. Often such men are assigned to the order of cardinal deacons. Among the cases that may arise are those of a bishop or archbishop who is widely esteemed but is not made a cardinal for some specific (though rarely publicly announced) reason. It may be, for example, that such a appointment, given while he is under the age of 80, would increase in a disproportionate way the number of cardinals from a single country eligible to participate in the next conclave, or else it would risk creating an expectation that his successors will in future necessarily be made cardinals, too. In other cases, it has become the custom for the Pope to appoint from time to time as cardinals a small number of highly regarded theologians who have already reached the age of 80. Often in these cases, the rank assigned has been that of cardinal deacon.

There is also a practice of changing the rank of the cardinalatial church from deaconry to priestly title or vice versa, permanently or, as the phrase goes, &quot;pro hac vice&quot; (&quot;for this turn&quot;). For instance, a man appointed a cardinal deacon will by definition be assigned a church that has the rank of a &quot;deaconry&quot;. It is customary for a cardinal deacon, after ten years, to be able to petition for promotion to the rank of cardinal priest. This is usually granted. In this case, he may be assigned a completely different cardinalatial church which has the rank of a &quot;titulus&quot;. However, a commonly used alternative procedure is to raise the church to which he is already attached &quot;pro hac vice&quot; to the rank of a &quot;titulus&quot;.

In 2015 there were 67 &quot;deaconries&quot; assigned or assignable to one of the cardinals.

== Cardinal bishops ==

The cardinal bishops were originally the successors of the residential bishops who governed the seven dioceses around Rome known as suburbicarian dioceses. They had varying roles in the running of the diocese of Rome, sometimes functioning similarly to present-day auxiliary bishops. Cardinal bishops are now honorarily granted the title of a suburbicarian diocese, with the dean of the College of Cardinals additionally gaining that of Ostia.

Patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches who become cardinals (individually, not by right of their office) constitute an exception: their own patriarchal see is counted as their cardinal title. They belong to the order of cardinal bishops and, in the order of precedence, come before the cardinal priests and immediately after the cardinals who hold the titles of the seven suburbicarian sees.

<doc id="1055800" wikidata="Q7727625" url="?curid=1055800" title="The Cornell Review">
<text>The Cornell Review is an independent newspaper published by students of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. With the motto, &quot;We Do Not Apologize,&quot; the &quot;Review&quot; has a history in conservative journalism and was once one of the leading college conservative publications in the United States. While the ideological makeup of its staff shifts over the years, the paper has consistently accused Cornell of adhering to left-wing politics and political correctness, delivered with a signature anti-establishment tone. 

==History==

===Founding===
&quot;The Cornell Review&quot; was founded on Cornell&#x27;s Ithaca campus in 1984. Jim Keller, a government major, founded &quot;The Cornell Review&quot; during his senior year in the spring of 1984. The paper drew immediate and critical attention for its discordant rhetoric and &quot;shock journalism&quot;. Ann Coulter, then an undergraduate in the history department of the College of Arts and Sciences, served as its editor during the fall of 1984.

Much of the paper&#x27;s structure in the early years was influenced by the unanticipated success of the &quot;Dartmouth Review&quot; at Dartmouth College, which inspired conservative students at other institutions to found similar newspapers. The Institute for Educational Affairs, founded in 1978 to assist conservative academics, created The Collegiate Network in 1984 to offer these groups technical and financial assistance.

During the 1980s the &quot;Review&quot; targeted affirmative action, gay rights, communist sympathizers, abortion, and anti-apartheid activists, while defending the Reagan Administration, the Greek system, and the university administration (against striking workers). It notably criticized university-sponsored ethnicity-oriented residential communities, known as &quot;program houses&quot;, as segregationist.

In 1986, some students voiced their opposition to the paper by seeking out and shredding nearly every copy of one issue at a multitude of locations on campus during the early morning hours after delivery.

===Merger with &quot;Cornell American&quot;===
In 1992, before the &quot;Review&quot; had backed down from its more controversial positions, a deliberately unsensational rival publication began printing called &quot;The Cornell American&quot;. It became the &quot;demesne&quot; of social conservatives until it ceased publishing in 1996.

In 2003 and 2004, successive editors began a controversial revamp of the &quot;Review&quot;, swinging it toward a more libertarian conservatism and a more neutral editorial position. In response, former &quot;Review&quot; writer and activist Ryan Horn resurrected a new &quot;Cornell American&quot; to take up the social conservatism from which the &quot;Review&quot; had distanced itself. The &quot;Cornell Review&quot; and the &quot;Cornell American&quot; had switched roles: the &quot;Review&quot; had become the calmer and lower profile paper, and the &quot;American&quot; the more traditional.

Rivalry between the &quot;Review&quot; and the &quot;American&quot; began to die down during the ensuing years as the staffs of the respective papers changed and the editorial positions of both papers began to converge. In April 2007, students from the &quot;Review&quot; and the &quot;American&quot; agreed to merge the two papers in the interest of preserving a conservative voice on campus. The &quot;Review&quot; assumed the &quot;American&quot;&#x27;s slogan: &quot;Limited Government, Traditional Values, America First.&quot; It then reverted to the original &quot;Review&quot; slogan, &quot;The Conservative Voice on Campus,&quot; until it changed to &quot;We Do Not Apologize&quot; in late 2014. The change was made due to the growing libertarian nature of the newspaper&#x27;s staff and editorial stance.

===21st century===
The &quot;Review&quot; was embroiled in several controversies in the 1990s. In 1993, its funding was threatened after it printed a cartoon critical of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s move to permit homosexuals in the U.S. military which was widely called homophobic.

In 1997, the &quot;Review&quot; printed an anonymous editorial lampooning the Oakland, California school district&#x27;s move to teach in African-American English (AAE). Entitled &quot;So U Be Wantin&#x27; to Take Dis Class,&quot; it presented a mock catalogue of courses taught in a pastiche of AAE, for instance &quot;Da white man be evil an he tryin&#x27; to keep da brotherman down. We&#x27;s got Sharpton and Farrakhan so who da...man now, white boy.&quot; A student protest followed in which a number of copies of the &quot;Review&quot; were burned. The editors defended the editorial as satire and criticized the burning as suppression of free speech.

The &quot;Review&quot; historically prints pieces that bring great debate and controversy. In the autumn of 2002, &quot;Cornell Review Online&quot; published a column by Elliott Reed whose &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; piece exposed a coverup of vibrators to be sold at the campus health center. Reed discovered an email to a listserv which claimed the health center had agreed to sell vibrators and solicited comments from female students. The university claimed the email &quot;jumped the gun&quot;, as no decision had been made at that time. The &quot;Review&quot; was awarded a &quot;Campus Outrage&quot; nod from the conservative organization, Accuracy in Academia, for the piece.

The &quot;Review&quot; found itself in uncharted territory in 2008, with the election of 2008 and a national trend toward more liberal thinking. It marked the first time since 2001 that a Democratic president had been in office, but for the Review, the election of Barack Obama marked a greater shift on Cornell&#x27;s campus. The &quot;Review&quot; conducted a poll in 2012 that found that 60% of Cornell students that were registered to vote would be voting for Obama, compared to 14% for Mitt Romney.

==Cornell Insider==
In December 2008, &quot;The Cornell Review&quot; started its blog, Cornell Insider. It is primarily focused on breaking campus events.

The Insider has been linked by blogs of all sizes, including IvyGate. Legal Insurrection, Campus Reform,

The website also broke stories that were followed by media outlets, including &quot;The Hill&quot;, RealClearPolitics and &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;.

==Management and operations==
The &quot;Review&quot; was incorporated in 1986 as The Ithaca Review, Inc. The editorial staff is headed by an undergraduate editor-in-chief, while the business staff is headed by an undergraduate president.

Funding for the &quot;Review&quot; comes primarily from the Collegiate Network, a syndicate of conservative campus newspapers funded by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.

<doc id="1055801" wikidata="Q2249967" url="?curid=1055801" title="Babcock (crater)">
<text>Babcock is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It was named by the IAU in 1970, after American astronomer Harold D. Babcock. It lies on the northeastern edge of Mare Smythii, to the southeast of Mare Marginis. To the south of Babcock is the crater Purkynĕ, and to the east-northeast lies Erro. Babcock is located in a region of the Moon&#x27;s surface that is occasionally brought into view during favorable librations, although it is seen from the edge and so little detail can be discerned from an observer on the Earth.
The rim of Babcock has been eroded, notched and modified by subsequent impacts, leaving a somewhat irregular and uneven outer rim. The interior has been resurfaced by lava flows, and is relatively flat. In place of a central peak, a small crater lies very close to the crater midpoint. This crater has been designated Zasyadko. A smaller crater lies on the interior near the northern edge.

The area about Babcock has been subject to past inundations by basaltic lava flows, leaving the surface relatively flat and the remnants of ghost craters visible as curved ridges in the ground.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Babcock.

<text>Topinabee ( ) is an unincorporated community in Cheboygan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Mullet Township along the southwestern shores of Mullett Lake.

As an unincorporated community, Topinabee has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49791 ZIP Code.

==Geography==

Topinabee is located in Mullett Township in Cheboygan County along the southwest shores of Mullett Lake. It is in the Northern Michigan region of the Lower Peninsula around south of the Mackinac Bridge.

The lakefront community is centered along M-27, which is known locally as North Straits Highway. Interstate 75 runs about to the west. Located along Mullett Lake, Burt Lake is to the west. The Indian River is to the south and connects the two large lakes, and this stretch of waterways is known as the Inland Waterway. The city of Cheboygan is about to the northeast. The census-designated place of Indian River is directly to the south. Numerous other lakefront unincorporated communities are located to the north along M-27, including Long Point, Birchwood, Silver Beach, and Mullett Lake.

Topinabee has its own post office with the 49791 ZIP Code, which is primarily used for post office box services. The post office is located in the center of the community at 1593 North Straits Highway. Most of the community itself is served by the Cheboygan 49791 ZIP Code, while areas to the south are served by the Indian River 49749 ZIP Code.

The Mullett Township Hall and Fire Department is located in Topinabee at 1491 North Straits Highway. The fire department serves the community, the portion of the Mullett Township on the west side of Mullett Lake, and portions of the neighboring townships. The community is served by Inland Lakes Schools centered just to the south in Indian River.

==History==

The community was founded as early as 1881 when Michigan Central Railroad officials planned to establish a resort here on the southern shores of Mullett Lake. That year, hotel proprietor H. H. Pike moved to the area and platted the community. He named it for Potawatomi tribal leader Topinabee (Great Bear Heart), who ultimately signed the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. The treaty gave large areas of native lands to the European settlers, including Fort Dearborn. While Pike suggested the name Topinabee, the railroad company suggested the name Portage, but it was deemed too common of a name.

Pike, who was originally from Burlington, Vermont, moved to Niles, Michigan and frequently traveled up north through the area. He was so impressed with the location that he wanted to settle in the area in anticipation of the expanding railroad. Pike built his tavern on the west side of Mullett Lake prior to the railroad&#x27;s construction. He purchased land, opened his business, and platted the community with the hopes that the railroad would pass through the area on its way to the Straits of Mackinac. Another settler built a hotel on the opposite side of the lake with the hopes that the railroad would instead run along the east side of Mullett Lake. In 1881, the Michigan Central Railroad constructed its line on the west side through Pike&#x27;s property, and this led to the growth of the Topinabee community. The train depot was built the following year.

A post office in Topinabee opened on April 17, 1882 with Daniel Stofer serving as the first postmaster. A railroad depot was built near the shores of the lake about north of Indian River. The community centered along the railroad, and Pike&#x27;s hotel served as a main business for early travelers. The hotel was three stories tall and could accommodate up to 40 guest. The community grew to include a boat launch along the Inland Waterway, a tavern, and a casino. By 1886, trains ran daily through Topinabee. Pike sold many plats of his property to allow settlers to build cottages, and Topinabee became a popular resort community. The community had a population of 34 in 1895.

The steamboat &quot;Topinabee&quot; was established in 1903 along the Inland Waterway. The &quot;Topinabee&quot; ran daily and took travelers from Oden through the Inland Waterway to Cheboygan with many stops along the way. The steamboat would sometimes head further north to St. Ignace. The steamship would stop in Topinabee for an hour along its route for passengers to have dinner. Several other steamboats also utilized the Inland Waterway, which, in addition to the railroad, brought many people to Topinabee.

Pike died in 1900, and Edward Bailey purchased the hotel and renamed it Pike&#x27;s Summer Tavern. The hotel burned down in 1917 but was rebuilt the next year and named Hotel Topinabee. By this time, Topinabee had an established population and downtown area that included several shops and a bowling alley. The community became a popular tourist destination due to its scenic and peaceful environment. The hotel burned down again in 1928 and was rebuilt again. During the Great Depression, the hotel no longer became profitable and was sold to Edward Moloney for $850 in 1935. The hotel closed in 1950, and another fire in 1965 led to the hotel being razed in 1970.

===Recent history===

In 1958, the railway line was disestablished, and the train depot was bought by the township. The former station was converted into a historical museum and library, while the railway lines themselves were eventually removed. The structure was then converted into a full-time library, which still houses a safe that contains many historic railroad records and photographs.

By late-1961, Topinabee would benefit from the creation of M-27, which is a state highway that serves as a direct connector route from Interstate 75 in the south to U.S. Route 23 to the north in the city of Cheboygan. The highway passes directly through Topinabee and is known locally as North Straits Highway.

The path along the former railway line was converted into the North Central State Trail, which was completed in 2007. The trail is used primarily for biking, as well as snowmobiles during the winter. The trail connects Gaylord to Mackinaw City and runs directly through Topinabee along the shores of Lake Mullett. The Topinabee Trailhead is north of Indian River and continues north for to Cheboygan.

The Topinabee Library received a technology upgrade though a $7,804 grant by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in July 2000. By early 2022, the library received numerous structural upgrades, including new paint, interior shelving, and improvements to the surrounding environment. The Topinabee Library is listed as part of the US-23 Heritage Route. The area around the library and Lake Mullett shoreline has been organized as the Topinabee Beach Park with modern amenities along the North Central State Trail.

<text>Borman is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies across the southeast section of the mountainous inner ring, within the walled basin named Apollo.

The rim of Borman remains sharp-edged, although a smaller crater lies across its northwestern rim. The interior is rough but relatively flat. Borman L is an older and much more worn crater that is attached to the southern rim of Borman.

Borman crater is named after the American astronaut Frank Borman. In 1968, Borman and his Apollo 8 crewmates became the first humans to orbit the Moon. Two nearby craters are named after the other crew members, William Anders (Anders crater) and Jim Lovell (Lovell crater).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Borman.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Borman A — &quot;See&quot; McNair (crater).
* Borman X — &quot;See&quot; Resnik (crater).
* Borman Y — &quot;See&quot; McAuliffe (crater).
* Borman Z — &quot;See&quot; Jarvis (crater).

<text>A guernsey, or gansey, is a seaman&#x27;s knitted woollen sweater, similar to a jersey, which originated in the Channel Island of the same name, sometimes known as a knit-frock in Cornwall, especially Polperro.

==Origins==
The guernsey is the mainstay of Guernsey&#x27;s knitting industry which can be dated back to the late 15th century when a royal grant was obtained to import wool from England and re-export knitted goods to Normandy and Spain. Peter Heylin described the manufacture and export of &quot;waste-cotes&quot; during the reign of Charles I. The first use of the name &quot;guernsey&quot; outside of the island is in the 1851 &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot;, but the garment was in use in the bailiwick before that.

The guernsey was traditionally knitted by the fishermen&#x27;s wives and the pattern passed down from mother to daughter through the generations. While commercially available sweaters are machine knit, the final finishing of these machine-knit parts is completed by hand.

Mary Wright argues that the use and wearing of guernseys throughout the British Isles for over a century and a half almost justifies the guernsey for qualification as a national costume. A guernsey from the Folk Museum Guernsey was included in the 2010 BBC project &quot;A History of the World in 100 Objects&quot;.

The term can also refer to a similarly shaped garment made of woven cloth, also called a Guernsey shirt or smock. There are a number of different names for the same garments, for instance Guernsey frock, Guernsey shirt, smock-frock, or fisherman’s frock. Essentially these are all the same garment, with the materials varying based on the purpose for which it is worn.

==Pattern==
Two styles of guernsey exist: a plain &quot;working&quot; guernsey and a &quot;finer&quot; example that was generally saved for special occasions and Sunday-best attire. Traditionally, Ganseys were seamless and worked in the round using the circular knitting method.

The &quot;working&quot; guernsey design was kept simpler in order to reduce the amount of time and materials needed to produce. The sale of knitted garments to supplement family income was important to many island families and thus the garments that were sold were also of a simple design. It is estimated that a total of 84 hours was needed to complete a guernsey: a simpler design could be produced faster than a more elaborate one.

Twenty-four principal patterns have been identified in Cornwall alone, each one again drawing inspiration from ropes, chains, waves, nets and sand-prints.

Worn as a source of pride and often knitted by prospective wives &quot;to show the industrious nature of the woman he was about to marry&quot;, the &quot;finer&quot; guernsey was more elaborately patterned than its working cousin. With the advent of the machine-knitted guernsey and the decline in the knitting industry, this guernsey is a much rarer sight.

It is not uncommon for a guernsey to last several decades and be passed down in families. Guernseys knitted for children were knitted to be &quot;grown into&quot; and often came down to the knee.

==Use in the British Armed Forces==
The guernsey was first widely used in the rating uniform of the 19th-century British Royal Navy. It is said that guernseys were worn at the Battle of Trafalgar (although these were probably made from woollen cloth, rather than knitted).

Orders for variants of the guernsey have also come from the Intelligence Corps, the Mercian Regiment, the Tank Regiment and Gurkha Logistics where they form part of officer uniforms.

== Export Market ==
Guernseys are still being knitted for local use and export. Japan is at present one of the biggest export markets. In January 2025 NHK(Japan&#x27;s national TV network) came to the Guernsey to make a documentary about the island&#x27;s famous knitwear.

== Use in other languages ==
The translation for the word &quot;jumper&quot; or &quot;sweater&quot; in the Goidelic languages, Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx, are &quot;geansaí&quot;, &quot;geansaidh&quot; and &quot;gansee&quot; respectively, all borrowings from the English guernsey/gansey. The Norwegian word &quot;genser&quot; is derived from &quot;guernsey&quot; and means sweater or jumper. In Danish a guernsey is called a &quot;sømandstrøje&quot;, meaning a seaman&#x27;s sweater.

<text>Boss is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northeast rim of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Due to its location, the crater is viewed from the side by observers on the Earth, and its visibility is subject to libration effects. It was named by the IAU in 1964 for astronomer Lewis Boss.

This formation has not been significantly eroded by impacts, and it retains a well-defined outer rim that is not overlain by smaller craters of note. The inner wall is wide and has a d surface. The interior floor has a low central peak that is offset slightly to the north from the midpoint.

The closest named craters are Vashakidze to the southeast on the far side of the Moon, and the heavily eroded Riemann to the south. Further to the southwest is the prominent crater Gauss, and to the north-northwest is the Mare Humboldtianum.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Boss.

<text>The University of Victoria Students&#x27; Society (UVSS) is a student union that represents undergraduate students at the University of Victoria. The students&#x27; society was founded in 1921 and incorporated in 1964. It provides services and operates business for students through the Student Union Building (SUB), and historically has advocated for special interests on campus.

==Governance==

===Board of directors===
The Board of Directors is the decision-making body for the Society and directs all work of the Society. The board is composed of student representatives elected from the student body. The board is made up of:

* Five salaried executives:
** Director of Outreach &amp; University Relations,
**Director of Student Affairs, 
**Director of Finance &amp; Operations, 
**Director of Events, and; 
**Director of Campaigns &amp; Community Relations
* A Director of International Student Relations,
* 2 Directors at-large,
* 9 Faculty Directors; and,
* Five advocacy group representatives: 
**The Native Students&#x27; Union,
**Pride Collective, 
**The Students of Colour Collective, 
**The Society for Students with a Disability, and; 
**Gender Empowerment Centre (GEM)

===Elections===
Board members are elected annually in March and advocacy representatives are nominated by their groups and approved by the board.

Up until 2009, the elections to the UVSS Board of Directors were run internally by a committee of the Society and staff members. Since that time, the UVSS has changed its by-laws and has given much of its authority to run the elections away to externally hired individuals. Policy for the elections is still determined by the Board of Directors.

==History==

===Founding===
The Students&#x27; Society was first incorporated in 1964, just one year after the creation of the University of Victoria (UVic) itself, as the Alma Mater Society of the University of Victoria (AMS). The AMS took its name from student associations like the University of British Columbia and McGill University, to which Victoria College (UVic&#x27;s predecessor) was affiliated. The name was changed in 1989 to make clearer what the organization actually is, a student society.

Students at the newly founded UVic already had their own building and a ready-made students&#x27; society, as students at Victoria College (now the home of Camosun College) were organized well before the UVic campus opened. As early as 1957, students at Victoria College began levying a building fee in anticipation of their new home at UVic. Consequently, the Student Union Building (SUB) was one of the first buildings built on campus. The SUB opened in 1963, built with matching funds made available by the provincial government&#x27;s building fund program. The building itself only consisted of the SUB Upper Lounge, the wing where the General Office is now located, and a downstairs section which housed the original Felicita&#x27;s Pub.

Between 1963 and 1970, membership in the Society was around two thousand students. There were only four buildings on campus and in 1967, when the residence buildings went up, only 300 students lived on campus. The Society at that time was mostly operated by volunteers and a very small staff. However, towards the end of the sixties, the Society began to grow more sophisticated. By the seventies, the cafeteria (previously more of a kiosk) began operating regularly, the Society got a liquor license, and the pub increased its hours. What is now Cinecenta got its start with students, working out of an office in the SUB, showing movies using a 16mm projector in the MacLaurin and Elliot buildings.

In 1976 the building expanded, again financed through students. This time, however, the fee referendum to finance the additional 30 000 square feet failed. The Society&#x27;s operating budget could only finance a smaller addition of 13 000 square feet, which meant that many of the architectural features originally designed for the expansion were lost. The 1976 addition saw the wing where Cinecenta and the Munchie Bar, Medicine Centre Pharmacy, Chiropractor, and On the Fringe are now located. Also the third floor was added as the home of CFUV (now located in the SUB&#x27;s lower level).

===1980s and 1990s===
The Society’s organizational structure changed significantly in 1989. At this point, the Society began employing its own general manager. In the fall of 1989, the entire structure of the Society was reorganized into the divisional structure, which exists with some modifications today.

The Student Initiatives Project, approved by referendum in 1991, consisted of a significant fee increase to finance the expansion and renovation of the SUB, to build a campus Day Care building, and to finance an Emergency Student Aid Fund. The completion of the expansion and renovation of the SUB in 1996 was another significant marker in the history of the Society. The SUB as it is known today is a product of that expansion.

===2000s===

The growth and change of the 1990s led to a worsening financial situation which reached a crisis point in 2001. The Society had been running deficits every year for about 10 years until the cumulative deficit had reached the hundreds of thousands. As if this unsustainable trend wasn’t enough, the Society rang up an over $400,000 deficit in just one year in 2000–2001. The huge deficit was only discovered during the Society’s annual audit in fall 2001, as the corrupt Business &amp; Operations Manager, Vivek Sharma, had been falsifying statements and stealing from the Society. The Board responded swiftly and decisively by pressing charges against the since resigned Sharma, terminating the General Manager, and conducting a forensic audit.

After this crisis unfolded, the Board of Directors embarked on a plan to tighten controls in the SUB’s business operations by such methods as reducing labour costs and food wastage, controlling liquor, and putting locks on freezers and coolers to prevent theft. The Society also secured a half-million dollar loan from UVic against the SUB, which was instrumental in ensuring that the Society was able to meet its financial obligations without interruption. As the 2001–2002 financial year was already half over when the financial crisis was uncovered, the Society could not escape another deficit in the hundreds of thousands. However, beginning in 2002–2003 the Society ran surpluses every year until the Society’s debt of approximately $1 million was repaid in full in 2006–2007.

In 2008 the United Steel Workers union representing staff at the UVSS went on strike for a three months, this in combination with a weak economy, and rising costs pushed the Society back into a $350,000 debt by 2009.

===2010-present===
To address the growing deficit and put the Society back on its feet the 2010-2011 board put a number of fee referendums to members in November 2010 all of which passed. The Capital Fund was reduced and shifted into the Operations Fund, dedicated fees for events and elections were established, and a modest increase of 40 cents per full-time student per semester, each semester over a three-year period was also established. Besides this, the 2010-2011 board shifted from a three-person senior management structure to a two-person management structure which further reduced costs for the Society.

In 2010-11, the Board moved from a 4-person executive structure to a 5-person executive structure. This change was passed at a Special General Meeting in January 2010 and was largely done in acknowledgement of the fact that certain executive positions had an inordinate amount of work in comparison to other positions.

Major changes on the political front happened in the early twenty-tens as well. After holding a referendum on membership in the Canadian Federation of Students, UVSS members voted to leave the Federation in March 2011 after more than twenty-five years of membership. Following this, the UVSS established the Where&#x27;s The Funding? campaign in conjunction with a number of other student societies in BC.

In recent years, the divestment movement has been a primary focus for UVSS campaigns.

==Student groups==
===Clubs===
Clubs are interest groups run by students and administered by the UVSS. There are over 150 student groups on a variety of topics.

Clubs receive a small amount of funding each semester from a student levy and are governed by clubs policy and Clubs Council.

===Course Unions===
Course Unions are department focused student groups run by students from a specific department and administered by the UVSS. There are over 25 Course Unions representing departments across campus, a list of all active clubs can be found on the UVSS Course Union Website. Any student that wants to start a Course Union can do so by talking to the Director of Student Affairs who has an office located in the Students’ Society Centre (SUB B103)

Course Unions receive a small amount of funding each semester from a student levy and are governed by Course Union policy and Course Union council.

===Professional Development Unions (PDUs)===
There are four active Professional Development Unions at the University of Victoria. Each PDU is run semi-autonomously with funds being raised solely by the students within that department. While each PDU raises its own funds, they are considered under the umbrella of the UVSS for purposes related to the University Act (British Columbia).

===Advocacy Groups===
Advocacy groups are organizations within the UVSS serve to represent certain special interests on campus or within society. Advocacy groups are funded by imposing fees on students that are created through by referendum. Each of the groups has voting representation on the UVSS Board of Directors.

==Affiliate organizations==

Affiliate organizations are on-campus groups that receive a student levy that has been approved by referendum. All of the affiliate groups act semi-autonomously with their own governing structures.

===The Martlet===
The Martlet is a bi-weekly student newspaper at the University of Victoria (UVic) in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. There are over a dozen employees on the payroll, but significant work is done by student volunteers (writing, taking photos, copy editing). The Martlet is funded partially by student fees, and partially by advertisements. The newspaper is distributed freely around the UVic campus and various locations around greater Victoria every second Thursday during the school year, and on a monthly basis in the summer. The paper also maintains a website. The Martlet was a member of the Canadian University Press but ceased membership in 2013.

===CFUV 101.9FM===
CFUV is a campus/community radio station broadcasting on 101.9 FM in British Columbia, Canada. It serves the University of Victoria, Greater Victoria and, via cable, Vancouver Island and many areas in the Lower Mainland. It is owned and run by the University of Victoria Student Radio Society. The station offers programs that include a diverse range of musical styles and talk shows on political and cultural issues.

===Vancouver Island Public Interest Research Group (VIPIRG)===
VIPIRG is a non-profit organization dedicated to research, education, advocacy and action in the public interest.

VIPIRG also hosts an alternative research centre with magazines, videos, books and clippings dealing with a wide range of social justice and environmental issues.

===UVic Sustainability Project (UVSP)===
UVSP is a student-run organization that strives to work with the campus community to achieve a balance between what is ecologically necessary, socially desirable and economically feasible at UVic.

===UVic Campus Community Gardens===
The Campus Community Garden is a UVSS club that manages the urban agriculture space on campus, with practical support from Facilities Management and the UVic Sustainability Office. The garden is located off of Mckenzie Avenue across from the athletic fields. There are 90 plots at the gardens. Due to the high demand for plots, rentals are restricted to current UVic students, faculty and staff, though volunteers from outside the UVic community are welcome.

==Services==

===Universal Bus Pass (U-PASS)===
The Universal Bus Pass (U-PASS), started in 1999, allows students unlimited travel on the Victoria Regional Transit System. The Pass must be renewed each semester at either the University Centre or the Info Booth in the SUB and costs the equivalent of one adult monthly pass.

===Anti-Violence Project (AVP)===
The Anti-Violence Project (AVP) is the on-campus sexual assault centre. The support services are confidential and available to anyone who has experienced sexualized violence or knows someone who has.

===Food Bank===
Rising tuition costs and debt loads signalled an increase in the needs of the membership and in September 2000, the Board of Directors began funding and operating an emergency food bank in the SUB. By 2003, demand had increased substantially and a referendum approved a $0.50 per student levy to operate the food bank.

===Health and Dental Plan===
Established by student referendum, the UVSS Health and Dental Plan is extended health and dental coverage specifically for students. 
All undergraduate students who are registered in at least 3 units of on-campus classes are automatically enrolled in the health plan.

===Ombudsperson===
The Office of the Ombudsperson is an independent, impartial, and confidential resource for undergraduate and graduate students (current, former, or prospective) and other members of the University community.

The Office provides information and guidance on students’ rights &amp; responsibilities, and UVic regulations &amp; procedures. The Ombudsperson is also an &quot;agent for change,&quot; recommending improvements to policies and advocating for fair procedures. The ombuds office also offers workshops and talks on conflict and communication, fairness, and related issues.

===Other services===
Though the Student Union Building, the UVSS also offers free phones, a banner room, a darkroom, and study space.

==Controversies==

*2008-2013 Youth Protecting Youth (YPY) was a anti-abortion club at UVic and funded by students. Over the past few years there have been a number of discussions and controversies relating to their activities on-campus. In 2008 and 2009 funding was cut off as a result of the groups posters and activities. In 2010 funding and ratification were lost as a result of continuing controversial activities. In 2010 YPY launched a lawsuit against the UVSS where they were given back their withheld funding and ratification. YPY lost their booking privileges in spring 2012 because of a graphic display held on campus. YPY has since filed a constitutional lawsuit against UVic in relation to a cancelled booking in February 2013. An out-of-court settlement was agreed and as of 2017, YPY is a regular student club which participates in standard events such as &quot;clubs day&quot;.
*2010 Fraternities and Sororities were looking to get recognised by UVic and the UVSS. This resulted in one of the largest AGMs in UVSS history where students ultimately decided to not recognize the Fraternities and Sororities. The groups do continue to exist without the University recognition.
*2009-2012 From 1985 to 2011 the UVSS was member local 44 of the Canadian Federation of Students. In late 2009, a petition was circulated among the membership to demand a referendum on continued membership. Despite having reached the required number of signatures, the CFS denied that the petition was valid. The UVSS retained a lawyer on behalf of the membership in order to demand a legal referendum. In March 2011, 70.5% of UVic students voted in a referendum to leave the CFS. The UVSS&#x27;s membership in CFS-National ended on June 30, 2011. The provincial component of the CFS, CFS-BC, has since removed the UVSS as a member.
*The UVSS received two F&#x27;s in the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedom&#x27;s report &quot;The State of Campus Free Speech in 2012&quot;. 
*The Campus Freedom Index, run by the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedom, ranks universities&#x27; and student unions&#x27; free speech practices. It gave the UVSS F&#x27;s in &quot;student union policies&quot; and D&#x27;s in &quot;student union practices&quot; in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.
*In March 2017 Third Space (the advocacy group for women and transgender students) spent thousands of its student-funded budget to erect a white wall with &quot;How do you challenge white supremacy?&quot; written on it in front of the Student Union Building. There were black markers left for students to write their responses. Overnight the wall was vandalized with white supremacist messages. The wall was removed.

<text>Norman is a small lunar impact crater on the Oceanus Procellarum, to the south and slightly west of the crater Euclides. To the west-southwest is Herigonius. There are few other features of note in the vicinity, apart from some minor wrinkle ridges in the surface of the mare.

Norman is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. This feature was previously designated Euclides B prior to being renamed by the IAU.

<doc id="1055819" wikidata="Q6605429" url="?curid=1055819" title="Lost ball">
<text>The Laws of cricket determine how a lost ball is dealt with.

== Lost ball per 2017 Law changes ==
The 2017 Code of the Laws of cricket state that if the ball can not be found or recovered, the umpire will call and signal Dead ball (Law 20.4.2.10). The ball then ceases to be in play. Any penalties and runs completed plus the run in progress if the batsmen had crossed before the call of Dead ball will be added to the score (Law 18.9). If the batsmen had not crossed they would be returned to the ends that they occupied prior to the incomplete run. For instance if batsman A at the north end crosses batsman B before the call that run will count. If batsman A had not crossed batsman B he would be returned to the north end and that run would not count.

The wear on a ball determines how it behaves in the air and when it pitches. As a result of this, when Dead ball is called, Law 4.5 requires the umpires to replace the ball with one in a similar condition.

== Lost ball prior to 2017 Law changes ==
Before the Laws of cricket were rewritten and reordered in 2017, a different procedure applied which was governed by the old Law 20. Any fielder would be able to call &quot;lost ball&quot; upon which the ball would automatically become dead. The batting team would keeps any penalty that would have been declared if the delivery was not fair (see no-ball and wide) plus the greater of 6 runs, or runs completed plus the run in progress if the batsmen had crossed before the call of &#x27;lost ball&#x27; was made.

<text>Tlen.pl was an adware licensed Polish instant messaging service. It was fully compatible with the main Polish Gadu-Gadu instant messenger. It was launched in 2001 and discontinued in May 2016.

The communication protocol is based on open-source jabberd code, but it was modified significantly, making it incompatible with generic XMPP clients and servers. Among other features, Tlen.pl allows for voice chats, SMS sending and video conferences. The versions later than 4.0 allow for creation and usage of plugins. Since then more than 130 plugins have been created by the community.
By April 2008 there were more than 1 500 000 registered users and 780 000 real users of Tlen.pl.

Tlen is also integrated with the o2.pl mail system, which allows users to use mail in three domains: o2.pl; go2.pl and Tlen.pl. It is possible to easily access the mail system from the application. Tlen.pl automatically checks the user&#x27;s account and if there is any new mail, it displays a notification on their screen.

It is also possible to connect to Tlen.pl from the Tlen.pl homepage with a browser.

Since version 6.0.1.7, Tlen has included the Tlenofon plugin, which enables VoIP functionality for the client. Tlenofon is similar to the Skype service and offers low-priced calls to Poland and other countries.

In the second half of 2009, Tlen 7 Beta was published. There were no longer any advertisements. The popularity of the service has been declining, however. The software has not been updated since 2011, and the server has been shut down on 10 May 2016.

<text>LIAT (1974) Ltd, also known as Leeward Islands Air Transport Services and operating as LIAT, was a regional airline headquartered in Antigua and Barbuda that operated high-frequency inter-island scheduled services to 15 destinations in the Caribbean. The airline&#x27;s main base was V.C. Bird International Airport, Antigua and Barbuda, with a secondary base at Grantley Adams International Airport, Barbados.

On 27 June 2020, the Antiguan prime minister Gaston Browne announced that LIAT would be liquidated following increased debt and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline will be reformed into a new entity Liat (2020) which will continue to provide connections between the Caribbean islands. Liat (2020) commenced limited service in August 2024.

On 24 July 2020, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda secured an order for administration for LIAT and named Cleveland Seaforth of BDO as administrator of the company. Seaforth was given a 120-day deadline to devise a restructuring plan and present it to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court.

LIAT ceased operations on 24 January 2024.

==History==

===Early years===
Leeward Islands Air Transport Services was founded by the late Kittitian (now Sir) Frank Delisle in Montserrat on 20 October 1956 and began flying with a single Piper Apache operating between Antigua and Montserrat. With the acquisition in 1957, of 75 percent of the airline by the larger, better known BWIA, LIAT was able to expand to other Caribbean destinations and to obtain new aircraft types, such as the Beechcraft Bonanza and de Havilland Heron. Hawker Siddeley HS 748s came in 1965, due to the airline&#x27;s decision to phase out the Herons. In 1968, LIAT was operating some flights via an agreement with Eastern Air Lines to provide passenger feed at this U.S.-based air carrier&#x27;s hub located in San Juan, Puerto Rico and was flying &quot;Eastern Partner&quot; service between San Juan and Antigua, St. Kitts and St. Maarten.

LIAT was not always an all-propeller aircraft airline. After Court Line, a UK-based air carrier, obtained 75 percent of the airline in 1971, LIAT entered the jet age, using stretched British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 500 twin jets provided by Court Line for their busier Caribbean routes. Smaller Britten-Norman Islander STOL-capable (short take-off and landing) twin prop aircraft were operated during this time as well as 48-passenger seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 &quot;Avro&quot; turboprops. LIAT operated the stretched version of the British-manufactured BAC One-Eleven, being the series 500 model, which was comparable to McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 being flown during the late 1960s and early 1970s, by a competing airline, Puerto Rico-based Caribair (Puerto Rico). The BAC One-Eleven jets were supplied to LIAT by U.K.-based Court Line. According to a 1973 LIAT route map, the airline was operating scheduled BAC One-Eleven series 500 jet service at this time from Antigua, Barbados, Caracas, Venezuela, Fort-de-France, Martinique, Kingston, Jamaica, Port of Spain, Trinidad, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Lucia (via Vigie Airport which is now George F.L. Charles Airport), St. Maarten, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Tobago.

Court Line went bankrupt in August 1974, and the BAC One-Elevens were removed from the LIAT fleet. In order to keep the airline flying, the governments of 11 Caribbean nations stepped in and acquired the airline. The jets were replaced with a series of smaller types, such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL (short take-off and landing) turboprop. By late 1979, LIAT was operating three aircraft types including the 48-passenger seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 &quot;Avro&quot; turboprop as well as the 9-passenger seat Britten-Norman Islander and the 18-passenger seat Britten-Norman Trislander with the latter two aircraft having STOL capability for short runways.

The 1980s were a decade of growth for the airline. By 1986, many daily flights were operated to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as other regions that the airline had never flown to. Faster de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8 turboprops were acquired to reduce flight times systemwide.

In November 1995, LIAT was partially privatized, to save it from bankruptcy once again. LIAT also began operating the larger 50-seater de Havilland Canada DHC-8-300 Dash 8 turboprop.

===Development since the 2000s===
In June 2013, LIAT received its first ATR 72 series 600 aircraft (registration V2-LIA). The airline completed its transition from the Dash 8 fleet to an all ATR fleet in 2016.

In January 2007, the airline announced an intended merger with Caribbean Star Airlines, and they entered into a commercial alliance, involving the flying of a combined schedule. All flights were marketed as LIAT, although the airlines continued to operate separately using their own air operators&#x27; certificates, until after completion of the merger. The merged airline was planning to use the LIAT brand with a merged fleet which is standardized on the Bombardier Dash 8 Q300. However, in June 2007, the shareholder governments of Barbados, Antigua, and St. Vincent gave the go-ahead to the board of directors to buy out the assets of Caribbean Star instead. LIAT purchased Caribbean Star Airlines on 24 October 2007, and five of the Caribbean Star&#x27;s DHC-8 aircraft were then transferred to LIAT. As another result of the merger, LIAT changed its slogan to &quot;LIAT, Star of the Caribbean&quot;, which was used as the slogan for a short time, and was then changed back to &quot;The Caribbean Airline&quot;.

On 27 June 2020, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda announced that LIAT would be liquidated following a series of unsuccessful months due to COVID-19. The airline was reformed as a new entity that provides vital connections between the Caribbean islands.

LIAT suspended all their operations on 24 January 2024, resulting in the layoffs of more than 90 employees.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
The airline is owned by eleven Caribbean governments, with three being the major shareholders: Barbados, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines along with Dominica (94.7%); other Caribbean governments, private shareholders, and employees (5.3%). It has 667 employees (in December 2018). The government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, which also is the majority shareholder along with Jamaica of another regional carrier, Caribbean Airlines, the national airline of Trinidad and Tobago, is a minority shareholder in LIAT. However, it allows the Government of Barbados to use these shares by proxy.

The airline is currently in Administration as the Government of Antigua and Barbuda seeks to take over and restructure the airline. However, the ownership has not changed as of March 2021.

===CEOs===
On April 22, 2014, British aviation executive David Evans was appointed as CEO of LIAT. Evans&#x27; appointment came weeks after the shareholders mandated Chairman Jean Holder to study the future of the airline for 100 days, and shareholder Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves had boasted that more than 200 people had applied for the position. Evans resigned on April 13, 2016, amidst a heated meeting with the board of directors, leaving LIAT yet again without a CEO. In August 2017, Julie Reifer-Jones was appointed CEO of the company. She was the first female CEO of the airline and the only female CEO of an airline in the Caribbean. On 31 July 2020, Reifer-Jones announced her departure in a letter to employees. The airline is currently in administration so a CEO has not been appointed.

===Headquarters===
The airline is headquartered in Antigua. The engineering and flight operations department are located at the V. C. Bird International Airport in Saint George Parish, Antigua. The corporate headquarters which includes the call centre and customer relations departments are located at the Sealy Building on Sir George Walter Highway. The commercial department is located in St. Michael, Barbados.

===Criticism===
LIAT has a mixed reputation among both locals and visitors to and from the Caribbean Islands. Their flights often operate irregularly, with inconsistent arrival and departure. Baggage is often misdirected or not loaded entirely. They are known for having very poor customer service, late departures, flights cancellation, and their staff are criticized as surly and unhelpful. These problems were exacerbated with the 2010 strikes and again during the labor disputes in 2013 and 2017 – with many flights canceled and passengers stranded and unable to receive refunds. The management and head operators of the airline make it clear that they are not responsible for any flight cancellations or stranded passengers.

==Destinations==

LIAT provided service in the Eastern Caribbean region from Puerto Rico in the north to Georgetown, Guyana, in the south, linking the chain of islands in between.

===Codeshare agreements===
Until 2008, LIAT&#x27;s services to Anguilla, Antigua, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, and St. Vincent were codeshared with Carib Aviation, which also used Antigua and Barbuda as its hub. The agreement was canceled due to Carib Aviation&#x27;s discontinuation of all flights effective September 30, 2008.

LIAT in 2018, announced that it would join the Caribsky Alliance with Air Antilles and WINAIR. The alliance would make it easier for travel by having codeshare agreements between the three carriers.

The airline formerly maintained codeshare agreements with:
* BWIA West Indies Airways
* Carib Aviation
* Caribbean Helicopters

===Cargo services===
LIAT also provided cargo services, with its service called &quot;Quikpak&quot;. This service provided Airport-to-Airport &amp; Door-to-Door, customs-cleared delivery service throughout the Caribbean. The delivery time was typically within one or two days, and it was guaranteed by the LIAT staff.

LIAT would also begin all-cargo services with a Dash 8-100, which was to be converted from a passenger aircraft to a full-fledged cargo aircraft. Once the new cargo service came on stream, customers for the first time would be able to book cargo online on the company&#x27;s website. The introduction of its new cargo service was planned for later in 2011.

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===
At the time of its closure in January 2024, the LIAT fleet consisted of the following aircraft:
===Fleet development===
Early in 2013, the airline announced plans to acquire two entirely new types of turboprop aircraft, the 48-seat ATR 42 series 600 and 68-seat ATR 72 series 600 to replace its aging fleet of Dash 8&#x27;s, both purchased directly by the airline and acquired during their merger with Caribbean Star. The introduction of these new prop-jets would mark the first time that LIAT operated ATR aircraft. LIAT began accepting deliveries in mid-2013. Later in 2013 then CEO, Capt. Ian Brunton apologized for what he described as a &#x27;meltdown&#x27; around a re-fleeting exercise, with LIAT changing aircraft from Dash-8 types to ATR 42 and ATR 72 types. The troubles, which stranded thousands of passengers across LIAT&#x27;s 1,300 miles of network, started in early August and continued for some two months while LIAT struggled with crewing both types and deliveries of the new aircraft. To compound the problems, an engine of one of the new aircraft took a week to be replaced, and one of the new aircraft was chartered to the Prime Minister of Taiwan in the middle of the debacle. The CEO blamed the numerous flight delays and cancellations on &quot;unscheduled maintenance, crew shortages, bad weather, airport limitations, obtaining licenses for operating our new ATR aircraft, Tropical Storm Chantal, strong surface winds, unfavorable weather conditions, airport limitations, and runway lights&quot;. Capt. Brunton resigned in late September, with his departure on October 1, 2013.

===Previously operated===
The LIAT retired fleet includes the following aircraft types:
* ATR 72-600 
* Beechcraft twin Bonanza
* de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100
* Bombardier Dash 8-300
* BAC 1-11-500 - The BAC One-Eleven series 500 was the only jet aircraft type ever operated by LIAT.
* Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander
* Britten-Norman BN-2A-III Trislander
* de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter
* de Havilland DH-114 Heron
* Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante
* Hawker Siddeley HS 748

==Accidents and incidents==
*On August 23, 1959, a LIAT de Havilland DH-114 Heron 2B crashed on landing in St. Kitts. The aircraft was en route between St. Johns, Antigua, and St. Kitts. After landing, it overran the runway and was damaged beyond repair. No one was seriously injured and there were no fatalities.
*LIAT Flight 319: On August 4, 1986, a LIAT de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter crashed into the Caribbean Sea. The aircraft was en route between St. Lucia and St. Vincent when it crashed due to poor weather conditions, while on approach. After a full day&#x27;s search failed to find a trace of the Twin Otter, all of the 11 passengers and two crew were presumed dead.
*On December 2, 2010, LIAT flight LI362, a Bombardier Dash 8-Q300 (DHC-8-300) carrying 24 passengers, en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, made an emergency landing at the V.C. Bird International Airport in Antigua after losing a wheel from one of the main landing gear. As a precautionary measure, emergency services were placed on standby. The aircraft landed safely with no major damage or any injuries to the passengers or crew.
*On August 25, 2013, LIAT flight LI774, a Bombardier Dash 8-Q300 (DHC-8-300) carrying 43 passengers, en route from Guyana to Barbados made an emergency landing at the Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados after losing a wheel from one of the main landing gear on takeoff from Guyana. The aircraft landed safely with no major damage or any injuries to the passengers or crew.

<doc id="1055837" wikidata="Q1701027" url="?curid=1055837" title="Peary (crater)">
<text>Peary is the closest large lunar impact crater to the lunar north pole. At this latitude the crater interior receives little sunlight, and portions of the southernmost region of the crater floor remain permanently cloaked in shadow. From the Earth the crater appears on the northern lunar limb, and is seen from the side.

==Observation and etymology==
Since Peary is located nearly on the limb of the Moon as viewed from Earth, high-quality images of the crater were not available until space probes started photographing the Moon; the first high-quality images came from the US Lunar Orbiter 4 spacecraft. Since it is located nearly at the lunar north pole, it was named after the polar explorer Robert Peary.

==Physical features==

Peary is nearly circular, with an outward bulge along the northeast rim. There is a gap in the southwestern rim, where it joins the slightly smaller crater Florey. The outer rim of Peary is worn and eroded, creating a rugged mountainous ring that produces long shadows across the crater floor. The crater floor itself is relatively flat, but is marked by several small craterlets, particularly in the southeastern half. The southern third of the interior remains cloaked in shadows, and so its features can be readily discerned only by means of ranging methods (for example, laser altimetry).

Because of the low sun angle, the average temperature on the crater floor of Peary is between 30 and 40 K, one of the coldest locations in the Solar System.

===Illumination===
In 2004, a team led by Dr Ben Bussey of Johns Hopkins University, using images taken by the Clementine mission, determined that four mountainous regions on the rim of Peary appeared to remain illuminated for the entire lunar day. These unnamed &quot;peaks of eternal light&quot; are due to the Moon&#x27;s extremely small axial tilt, which also gives rise to permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters. &quot;Clementine&quot;″s images were taken during the northern lunar hemisphere&#x27;s summer season, and more detailed lunar topography collected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) showed that no points on the Moon receive perpetual light during both winter and summer.

The northern rim of Peary is considered a likely site for a future Moon base, due to this near-constant illumination, which would provide both a relatively stable temperature and a nearly uninterrupted solar power supply. It is also near permanently shadowed areas that may contain some quantity of frozen water.

<text>The Zürcher Schlittschuh Club Lions are a professional ice hockey team located in Zürich, Switzerland, playing in the National League (NL). Their home arena is the 12,000-seat Swiss Life Arena. The team was founded in 1930 and played at the Dolder-Kunsteisbahn from its establishment until 1950. Between 1950 and 2022 they played at the Hallenstadion.

==History==
ZSC Lions were formed in 1997 as a result of the merger of the two local teams: the highly popular Zürcher Schlittschuh Club (German for &quot;Zürich Skating Club&quot;), who were struggling financially in National League A, and the ice hockey section of Grasshopper Club Zürich of the National League B, backed by entrepreneur and billionaire Walter Frey.

ZSC was the first Swiss team to play in an indoor arena (Hallenstadion). They won the Swiss championship in the years 1936, 1949 and 1961 and the prestigious Spengler Cup in 1944 and 1945. After the merger, the ZSC Lions won the Swiss Championship in 2000, 2001, 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2018, and moreover won the IIHF Continental Cup in 2001 and 2002.

===Champions Hockey League and Victoria Cup===

During the 2008–09 Season, the ZSC Lions participated in the first ever Champions Hockey League. For the group stage, they were placed in group D with HC Slavia Praha and Linköpings HC. The Lions qualified for the semi-finals with a 3–1 record, first place in the group. With their defeats of the Finnish Espoo Blues, 6–3 and 4–1 respectively, they qualified for the tournament final. The first leg of the final was held on January 21, 2009 in the Magnitogorsk Arena where the Lions came back from a 0–2 deficit to Metallurg Magnitogorsk to end with a 2–2 tie. The second leg was played a week later, on January 28, 2009, in the Diners Club Arena in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland. ZSC Lions won the game and the Silver Stone Trophy with a 5–0 victory.

With their victory in the Champions Hockey League, the ZSC Lions qualified to play the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League for the 2009 edition of the Victoria Cup challenge. Playing at their home arena, the Lions upset the Blackhawks with a 2–1 victory, winning the trophy. It was the first time since 1991 that the Blackhawks had lost to a club in Europe.

<text>Shaler is a lunar impact crater that lies on the southeast interior edge of the Montes Cordillera mountain ring that surrounds the immense Mare Orientale formation. It is located near the southwest limb of the Moon on the near side, and so is viewed nearly from on edge from the Earth. Just to the northwest of the crater is the slightly smaller crater Wright.

The long, irregular Vallis Bouvard valley begins at the southern rim of Shaler, and winds its way to the south-southeast towards the crater Baade. This is one of several such valleys that radiate away from the southeast edge of the Mare Orientale impact basin, the other two being Vallis Inghirami and Vallis Baade.

Shaler has been affected by its location on the southern edge of the Montes Cordillera, as the floor is rough and irregular, particularly toward the southwest where several small, parallel clefts appear in the surface. The rim is nearly circular, although slightly flattened along the south edge, and the edge remains sharply defined with little appearance of erosion.

<text>Dahl, now officially Hagen-Dahl, is a locality within the independent city of Hagen in the southeastern Ruhr, in Germany. It was incorporated into Hagen in 1975 together with Rummenohl and Priorei.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The remains of an old hill fort, Ambrock, have been found under a farm in Dahl (previously in Delstern), the Ribberthof (formerly Unter-Ambrock; the farm was renamed in the 19th century to honor the chief donor to the Ambrock Clinic, which is located on the grounds of the former Ober-Ambrock farm). This indicates that it was a fortified encampment sometime in pre-Carolingian times, that is, prior to the 9th century. Two archaeological digs have not uncovered enough finds for a definite dating, but uninterpreted runic inscriptions found in material re-used for the construction of the farm indicate great age. The two estates of Ober- and Unter-Ambrock are mentioned in early mediaeval sources.

The earliest written mention of a location in Dahl is a 1050 deed of gift to Werden Abbey mentioning the estate of &quot;Rumenscetha&quot; (Rumscheid) and its owner, Aeluekin.

===1200–1800===

In the late Middle Ages, a knightly manor of &#x27;the Lord of Dael&#x27; is mentioned. Together with the stone church built in the second half of the 13th century, which is perhaps the oldest remaining building in the Volme valley, the site of this manor forms the centre of today&#x27;s Dahl. The manor house and the church were both in large part destroyed by a catastrophic fire on 17 September 1729.

===19th century===
After 1817, Dahl was an independent settlement, with its own mayor, within the district of Breckerfeld, but by order of the government of the Kingdom of Prussia was administratively subordinate to the district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of Hagen.

In 1823, Felix Gerstein, the local governor, had a residence built in classical style, Haus Dahl. The estate included of land, a mill, and 32 smallholdings and farms on both sides of the River Volme.

In the course of increasing industrialisation and the associated economic expansion, in 1844–47 the country road in the Volme valley was expanded, and around 1850 a stone bridge was built across the river to accommodate the increased traffic.

In 1874 the Volmetal-Bahn railway line opened between Hagen and Brügge in Lüdenscheid, which considerably sped up transport of the raw materials needed by industry, wood and iron ore (from the Siegerland) into the Ruhr and to the small ironworking shops in the valleys near the Volme.

===20th century===
In 1970 the former independent settlement of Dahl, consisting of Dahl, Priorei and Rummenohl, was incorporated into the town of Breckerfeld in the &quot;Kreis&quot; of Ennepe-Ruhr. In 1975, the Parliament of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia decided to transfer it to the metropolitan district of Hagen.
