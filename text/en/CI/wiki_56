<text>The Crossing is the debut album released by Scottish band Big Country in July 1983. The album reached #3 in the UK; overseas, it hit #4 in Canada on the &quot;RPM&quot; national Top Albums Chart and #18 in the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1983. It went on to be certified platinum in the UK and Canada. It contains the song &quot;In a Big Country&quot; which is their only U.S. Top 40 hit single. 

==Background==
In May 1982, Big Country signed a recording contract with Phonogram and soon began recording what was supposed to be their debut album with producer Chris Thomas. However, the entire recording session would eventually be scrapped when Big Country felt Thomas was not fully committing to the band due to other production commitments. Three songs were salvaged from the sessions – &quot;Harvest Home&quot;, &quot;Balcony&quot; and &quot;Flag of Nations (Swimming)&quot; – and released as the &quot;Harvest Home&quot; single in September 1982 through Phonogram&#x27;s imprint Mercury Records, reaching number 91 in the UK Singles Chart.

With new producer Steve Lillywhite, the band recorded the single &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; in early 1983, which became a UK Top Ten hit. In May, on the back of the single&#x27;s success, Lillywhite and the band proceeded to record &quot;The Crossing&quot;, which would include a re-recorded &quot;Harvest Home&quot;.

Stuart Adamson and fellow guitarist Bruce Watson used the MXR Pitch Transposer 129 effect pedal to create a guitar sound reminiscent of bagpipes. Also contributing to the band&#x27;s unique sound was their use of the e-bow, a hand-held device which, through the use of magnets, causes the strings of an electric guitar to vibrate producing a soft attack which sounds more like strings or synthesizer.

The album has been remastered and reissued on three occasions. The latest version released by Universal in 2012 in advance of the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary includes a second disc of previously unissued demos. Also included in the set are tracks produced by Chris Thomas from the first abortive attempt to record the band&#x27;s debut album. The demos include the earliest recordings done by Adamson and Watson, some of which were recorded on four-track prior to recruiting either a drummer or bassist for the band.

The set also includes a booklet with interviews (new in the case of the current band members and archived in the case of the late Stuart Adamson) by the journalist and author Tim Barr. Lyrics for all of the key songs are also included, and the album has been remastered by Paschal Byrne from the original master tapes. In total, ten previously unreleased tracks were included in the deluxe, digitally remastered edition.

==Music and lyrics==
The songs on &quot;The Crossing&quot; deal with topics including loss (&quot;Inwards,&quot; &quot;Chance&quot;), separation (&quot;Close Action&quot;), dehumanization (&quot;Lost Patrol&quot;), and the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion (&quot;The Storm&quot;). Many of the songs are characterized by Mark Brzezicki&#x27;s highly-compressed drums and the heavily effects-treated, layered guitars of Adamson and Watson. The music often demonstrates a clear influence of Scottish traditional music, particularly obvious in the pipe-band rhythms of &quot;In a Big Country&quot; and &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; and the swirling, Gaelic guitar intro to &quot;The Storm.&quot; This caused the band to be categorized as a Celtic rock band, which sometimes led to unfavorable comparisons with other bands such as Thin Lizzy.

==Reception==
Critic Kurt Loder of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a glowing review, writing:

<doc id="1062850" wikidata="Q1334000" url="?curid=1062850" title="School of Salamanca">
<text>The School of Salamanca () is an intellectual movement of 16th-century and 17th-century Iberian Scholastic theologians rooted in the intellectual and pedagogical work of Francisco de Vitoria. From the beginning of the 16th century the traditional Catholic conception of man and of his relation to God and to the world had been assaulted by the rise of humanism, by the Protestant Reformation and by the new geographical discoveries and their consequences. These new problems were addressed by the School of Salamanca. 

The name is derived from the University of Salamanca, where de Vitoria and other members of the school were based. The Salamanca School of economic thought is frequently regarded as an early precursor to the Austrian School of Economics. This is due to its development of the subjective theory of value, its advocacy for free-market principles, and its focus on the supply and demand of money—ideas that would eventually contribute to the modern concept of sound money.

==Scope of the term==
Most properly, the term applies merely to the intellectual movement of the early 16th century at the university of Salamanca led by Francisco de Vitoria. The University of Salamanca was founded in 1218 and was one of the homes of Thomisitic theology. More broadly, it comprises the bulk of Iberian Renaissance-Scholastic philosophy. In its broadest application, the notion is sometimes applied to the entirety of Second scholasticism, of which Vitoria&#x27;s career and legacy are but an early, albeit formative part. This, however, is highly misleading, as there are important strands of Second scholasticism, such as the Baroque Scotism, of which connexion to the Salamancan legacy is rather tenuous.

The term most often connotes developments specifically in the fields of philosophy of law and economics associated with Vitoria&#x27;s legacy; for Scholastic philosophy and theology of the 16th century in general the term &quot;Renaissance Scholasticism&quot; is now preferred by scholars.

==History and leading figures==
The intellectual movement started with Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546) and Domingo de Soto (1494–1560), both Dominican Thomists. The Thomist line was continued by the Carmelites Complutenses and Salmanticenses.

In the latter part of the 16th century, the newly founded Jesuits rose to intellectual prominence, with authors such as the Conimbricenses, Pedro da Fonseca (1528–1599), Luis de Molina (1535–1600), Gabriel Vásquez (†1604), and Francisco Suárez (1548–1617). 

With Suárez, however, the intellectual movement had already vastly surpassed its roots and Suárez&#x27;s legacy defines the transition from Renaissance to Baroque scholasticism of the 17th and 18th centuries, for which the term &quot;School of Salamanca&quot; is no longer appropriate.

== Law ==
===Philosophy of law===
Many leading figures of the school, such as Francisco de Vitoria, Domingo de Soto, Martín de Azpilcueta (or Azpilicueta), Tomás de Mercado, or Francisco Suárez, were not just philosophers and theologians but also jurists and scholars of natural law and of morality. They undertook the adaptation of the teachings of Thomas Aquinas to the then new political-economic order.

The juridical doctrine of the School of Salamanca represented a profound transformation of medieval concepts of law, with a revindication of liberty not habitual in Europe of that time. 

The natural rights of man came to be, in one form or another, the center of attention, including rights as a corporeal being (right to life, economic rights such as the right to own property) and spiritual rights (the right to freedom of thought and to human dignity).

=== Natural Law===
The members of the School of Salamanca were the first people to develop a modern approach of natural law. 

For Domingo de Soto, the theologian&#x27;s task is to assess the moral foundations of civil law. That&#x27;s how he criticized the new Spanish charities&#x27; laws on the pretext that they violated the fundamental rights of the poor, or that Juan de Mariana considered that the consent of population was needed in matter of taxation or money alteration.

Except for the earlier Laws of Burgos, the views of the Salamanca school constituted a quasi-novelty in European thought and went counter to those then predominant in Spain, and Europe that people indigenous to the Americas had no such rights. .

===Sovereignty===

The School of Salamanca distinguished two realms of power, the natural or civil realm and the realm of the supernatural, which were often conflated in the Middle Ages through granting royal control of investiture of bishops, or the temporal powers of the pope. 

One direct consequence of the separation of realms of power is that the king or emperor does not legitimately have jurisdiction over souls, nor does the pope have legitimate temporal power. This included the idea that there are limits on the legitimate powers of government. 

Thus, according to Luis de Molina a nation is analogous to the mercantile corporations of his time, in that those who govern are holders of power (effectively sovereigns) but a collective power, to which they are subject, derives from them jointly. 

Nonetheless, in de Molina&#x27;s view, the power of society over the individual is greater than that of a mercantile corporation over its members, because the power of the government of a nation emanates from God&#x27;s divine power (as against merely from the power of individuals sovereign over themselves in their business dealings).

At this time, the monarchy of England was extending the theory of the divine right of kings—under which the monarch is the unique legatee of God&#x27;s power—asserting that subjects must follow the monarch&#x27;s orders, in order not to contravene God&#x27;s design. Counter to this, several adherents of the School sustained that the &quot;people&quot; are the vehicle of divine sovereignty, which they, in turn, pass to a prince under various conditions. In this, the late scholastics were instrumental in the development of early modern theories of political representation.

Possibly the one who went furthest in this direction was Francisco Suárez, whose work &quot;Defensio Fidei Catholicae adversus Anglicanae sectae errores&quot; (&quot;The Defense of the Catholic Faith against the errors of the Anglican sect&quot; 1613) was the strongest contemporary defense of popular sovereignty. Men are born free by their nature and not as slaves of another man, and can disobey even to the point of deposing an unjust government. 

As with de Molina, he affirms that political power does not reside in any individual, but he differs subtly in that he considers that the recipient of that power is the people as a whole, not a collection of sovereign individuals—in the same way, Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s theory of popular sovereignty would consider the people as a collective group superior to the sum that composes it.

Gabriel Vásquez (1549–1604) held that natural law is not limited to the individual, but obliges societies to respect natural rights and justice.

For Suárez, the political power of society is contractual in origin because the community forms by consensus of free wills. The consequence of this contractualist theory is that the natural form of government is either a democracy or a republic, while oligarchy or monarchy arise as secondary institutions, whose claim to justice is based on consent of the governed organized in a political body.

===The law of peoples and international law===

Francisco de Vitoria played an important role in the early modern comprehension of &quot;ius gentium&quot; (the rights of nations). He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to relations between nations, concluding that international society as well ought to be ruled by just forms respecting the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and right. Vitoria has been referred to, along with Grotius, as the “father of international law.”

Francisco Suárez subdivided the concept of &quot;ius gentium&quot;. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished &quot;ius inter gentes&quot; from &quot;ius intra gentes&quot;. Ius inter gentes (which corresponds to modern international law) was a just agreement among the majority of countries, although being positive law, not natural law, it was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, &quot;ius intra gentes&quot;, or civil law, is specific to each nation.

Many scholars have argued for the importance of Vitoria and Suárez as the forerunners and founders of the International law field, and the precursors of the seminal text &quot;De iure belli ac pacis&quot; by Grotius. Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.

===Just war===
The School of Salamanca made significant contributions to just war theory, particularly in the writings of Francisco de Vitoria, Francisco Suárez, and Luis de Molina. Building on Thomas Aquinas and Augustine of Hippo, these scholars developed further the ethics of warfare.

Vitoria argued in his lecture &quot;De Indis&quot; that a just war requires legitimate authority, a just cause, and proportional means. He opposed wars motivated by religious conversion, territorial expansion, or personal ambition. Additionally, Vitoria held that both Christian and non-Christian societies possessed natural rights, rejecting the concept of natural slavery and affirming the right of indigenous peoples to sovereignty and property.

Suárez and Molina expanded on Vitoria’s ideas by making distinctions between natural law and the &quot;ius gentium&quot;. They proposed that, while natural law is universally binding, &quot;ius gentium&quot; constitutes a set of agreed-upon principles among nations, laying the groundwork for modern international law. Molina also recognized the possibility that each side in a conflict might perceive its cause as just, adding nuance to the subjective experience of warfare.

The Salamanca scholars debated the moral implications of Spain’s actions in the Americas, including the treatment and enslavement of indigenous peoples. Figures like Bartolomé de las Casas advocated for the rights of Amerindians against claims by Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, who viewed indigenous people as natural slaves. The consensus among Salamanca thinkers, however, was that enslavement based on race or religion was unjustifiable. Instead, they allowed for slavery only under limited conditions, such as capture in a just war, while condemning racial discrimination in enslavement.

These ideas marked a critical shift in moral and legal philosophy, as Salamanca scholars developed frameworks that emphasized universal human rights, dignity, and the ethical limitations of warfare, laying the intellectual groundwork for later developments in human rights and international law.

===The conquest of America===

In the 16th century, the School of Salamanca was the first to use the natural law&#x27;s principle that rights reside in the individual to question the Spanish colonization on the indigenous people of the Americas.

Francisco de Vitoria began his analysis of conquest by rejecting &quot;illegitimate titles,&quot; or illegitimate reasons for conquest. He was the first to dare to question whether the bulls of Alexander VI known collectively as the &quot;Bulls of Donation&quot; were a valid title of dominion over the newly discovered territories. In this matter he did not accept the universal primacy of the emperor, the authority of the pope (because the pope, according to him, lacked temporal power), nor the claim of voluntary submission or conversion of the Native Americans. One could not dismiss them as sinners or ignorant savages: they were free people by nature, with legitimate property rights. When the Spanish arrived in America they brought no legitimate title to occupy and rule those lands.

Vitoria also analyzed whether there were legitimate claims of title over discovered lands. He elaborated up to eight legitimate titles of dominion. The first and perhaps most fundamental relates to communication between people, who jointly constitute a universal society. 

==== Universal right to travel and conduct commerce ====
&quot;Ius peregrinandi et degendi&quot;, developed primarily by Francisco de Vitoria in the 16th century, established the universal right to travel and conduct commerce throughout the world, regardless of territorial governance or religious differences. This concept emerged as a fundamental principle within international law theory during the Age of Discovery.

Vitoria articulated this right in his lectures &quot;De Indis&quot; (On the Indians), arguing that restrictions on free movement and trade violated natural law. The doctrine encompassed several key elements: the right to travel (ius peregrinandi), the right to dwell in foreign territories (ius degendi), and the right to engage in commerce (ius commercii). 

Vitoria also used this principle to justify certain aspects of Spanish colonization. He argued that if indigenous peoples of the Americas denied these natural rights to Spanish travelers and merchants, the denied parties possessed a just cause for war (bellum iustum) and could legitimately claim territories acquired through such defensive actions. This interpretation significantly influenced subsequent colonial legal theory and the development of early modern international law. This doctrine remains relevant to modern debates about migration, international trade, and sovereignty.

==== The right to preach and proselytize ====
The second form of legitimate title over discovered lands referred to the right of the Spanish to preach and proselytize. The Indians could voluntarily refuse conversion, but forbidding missionaries would make the matter analogous to the first case. Nonetheless, Vitoria noted that although this can be grounds for a just war, it is not necessarily prudent because of the resulting death and destruction.

The other cases of this casuistry are:
* If the pagan sovereigns force converts to return to idolatry.
* If there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government.
* In the case of overthrowing a tyranny or a government that is harming innocents (e.g. human sacrifice)
* If associates and friends have been attacked—as were the Tlaxcaltecas, allied with the Spanish but subjected, like many other people, to the Aztecs—once again, this could justify a war, with the ensuing possibility of legitimate conquest as in the first case.
* The final &quot;legitimate title&quot; although qualified by Vitoria himself as doubtful, is the alleged mental incapacity of the foreign population resulting in lack of just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity and only for the advantage of the Indians.

Emperor Charles V, then ruler of Spain, took offense to this doctrine of &quot;legitimate&quot; and &quot;illegitimate&quot; titles purporting to limit his prerogatives, and he tried without success to stop its promulgation.

=== Contract Law ===

First movement to systematise contract law, the contractual doctrin of School of Salamanca is based on two pillars : freedom and equity.

The School of Salamanca played a great role in the diffusion of the contractual consensualism. If this idea was already admitted in canon law since the 12th Century and the application of the principle &quot;pacta sunt servanda&quot;, the civil law only followed this way in the 16th century after the call of famous jurists like Luis de Molina. Moreover, preceded notably by Leonardus Lessius, the jesuit Pedro de Oñate claimed the existence of a &quot;contractual freedom&quot; and an &quot;autonomy of the will&quot; on the grounds that the Man, created by God who made him free, have an autonomy in the management of his goods and of his commitments. However, this liberty isn&#x27;t complete because it cannot overstep the principle of free consent and because the contrat cannot ignore the formalism required by the authorities, or have an immoral object.

The members of the School of Salamanca also thought, following Luis de Molina, that contracts have been established for common utility and consequently, that natural law can&#x27;t tolerate a privileged party. To allow the application of this principle of commutative justice, they elaborated the concept of just price. Every violation of this notion constitutes a &quot;laesio&quot; for one, and an unjust enrichment, an infraction to the seventh Commandments and a sin for the other. Only a restitution of the undue prince enables the absolution and bring back the contractual equilibrium.

==Economics==

The School of Salamanca has been described as the &quot;first economic tradition&quot; in the field of economics. This put the origins of economic theory on Europe&#x27;s mainland, prompting a reassessment of the entire history of the discipline. Much attention has been drawn to the economic thought of the School of Salamanca by Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s &quot;History of Economic Analysis&quot; (1954). It did not coin, but certainly consolidated, the use of the term School of Salamanca in economics. Schumpeter studied scholastic doctrine in general and Spanish scholastic doctrine in particular, and praised the high level of economic science in Spain in the 16th century. He argued that the School of Salamanca most deserves to be considered the founders of economics as a science. The School did not elaborate a complete doctrine of economics, but they established the first modern economic theories to address the new economic problems that had arisen with the end of the medieval order. Unfortunately, there was no continuation of their work until the end of the 17th century and many of their contributions were forgotten, only to be rediscovered later by others.

The thinking of the School was defined as &quot;pro-market, pro-hard money, anti-state in many ways, pro-property, and pro-merchant to a surprising extent.&quot;

The English historian of economic thought Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson and Belgian legal historian Wim Decock have published numerous articles and monographs on the School of Salamanca.

Although there does not appear to be any direct influence, the economic thought of the School of Salamanca is in many ways similar to that of the Austrian School. Murray Rothbard referred to them as &quot;proto-Austrians&quot;.

===Antecedents===

In 1517, de Vitoria, then at the Sorbonne, was consulted by Spanish merchants based in Antwerp about the moral legitimacy of engaging in commerce to increase one&#x27;s personal wealth. From today&#x27;s point of view, one would say they were asking for a consultation about the entrepreneurial spirit. Beginning at that time, Vitoria and other theologians looked at economic matters. They moved away from views that they found to be obsolete, adopting instead new ideas based on principles of natural law.

According to these views, the natural order is based in the &quot;freedom of circulation&quot; of people, goods, and ideas, allowing people to know one another and increase their sentiments of brotherhood. This implies that merchantry is not merely not reprehensible, but that it actually serves the general good.

===Private property===
The adherents of the School of Salamanca all agreed that property has the beneficial effect of stimulating economic activity, which, in turn, contributed to the general well being. Diego de Covarrubias y Leyva (1512–1577) considered that people had not only the right to own property but—again, a specifically modern idea—they had the exclusive right to the benefit from that property, although the community might also benefit. Nonetheless, in times of great necessity, there, all goods become a commons.

Luis de Molina argued that individual owners take better care of their goods than is taken of common property, a form of the tragedy of the commons.

=== Money, value, and price ===
With their reflexions on Contract law and fairness in exchange, the members of the School of Salamanca were often confronted with the concept of value. Thus observing the effect of American silver and gold arrivals in Spain, namely lessening of their values and augmentation of prices, Martín de Azpilcueta established the idea of a value-scarcity, first form of the quantity theory of money.

The just price of something, which respects the principle of commutative justice, depend on many factors. It have a certain latitude because it&#x27;s not the result of God&#x27;s will or of labor but of the common estimation of the people (communis aestimatio hominum). On this Luis Saravia de la Calle wrote in 1544:
Those who measure the just price by the labour, costs, and risk incurred by the person who deals in the merchandise or produces it, or by the cost of transport or the expense of traveling...or by what he has to pay the factors for their industry, risk, and labour, are greatly in error... For the just price arises from the abundance or scarcity of goods, merchants, and money...and not from costs, labour, and risk... Why should a bale of linen brought overland from Brittany at great expense be worth more than one which is transported cheaply by sea?... Why should a book written out by hand be worth more than one which is printed, when the latter is better though it costs less to produce?... The just price is found not by counting the cost but by the common estimation.

However, as Friedrich Hayek has written, the school rarely followed this idea through systematically. His members thought that authories were sometimes required to intervene and to control prices, especially in monopoly cases or for staples. The opportunity of an economic interventionnism, called arbitrism, wasn&#x27;t unanimously accepted : if somes thought that the prince concerned of public interest is more trustable that greedy merchants, like Domingo de Soto and Tomás de Mercado, others like Luis de Molina, Leonardus Lessius or Juan de Lugo considered that any intervention of the authorities is inopportune owing to the corruption and the clientelism that it&#x27;ll created.

===Interest on money===
Usury (which in that period meant &quot;any&quot; charging of interest on a loan) has always been viewed negatively by the Catholic Church. The Third Lateran Council condemned any repayment of a debt with more money than was originally loaned; the Council of Vienne explicitly prohibited usury and declared any legislation tolerant of usury to be heretical; the first scholastics reproved the charging of interest. In the medieval economy, loans were entirely a consequence of necessity (bad harvests, fire in a workplace) and, under those conditions, it was considered morally reproachable to charge interest.

In the Renaissance era, greater mobility of people facilitated an increase in commerce and the appearance of appropriate conditions for entrepreneurs to start new, lucrative businesses. Given that borrowed money was no longer strictly for consumption but for production as well, it could not be viewed in the same manner. The School of Salamanca elaborated various reasons that justified the charging of interest. The person who received a loan benefited; one could consider interest as a premium paid for the risk taken by the loaning party. There was also the question of opportunity cost, in that the loaning party lost other possibilities of utilizing the loaned money. Finally, and perhaps most originally, was the consideration of &quot;money itself&quot; as a merchandise, and the use of one&#x27;s money as something for which one should receive a benefit in the form of interest.

Martín de Azpilcueta also considered the effect of time, formulating the time value of money. All things being equal, one would prefer to receive a given good now rather than in the future. This preference indicates greater value. Interest, under this theory, is the payment for the time the loaning individual is deprived of the money.

==Theology==
Under Francisco de Vitoria, the University of Salamanca led a period of intense activity in theology, especially a renaissance of Thomism, whose influence extended to European culture in general, but especially to other European universities. Perhaps the fundamental contribution of the School of Salamanca to theology is the study of problems much closer to humanity, which had previously been ignored, and the opening of questions that had previously not been posed. The term &quot;positive theology&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish this new, more practical, theology from the earlier &quot;scholastic theology&quot;.

===Morality===
To analyze the morality of the acts was considered the most practical and useful study one could undertake to serve society. The novel contributions of the School in law and economics were rooted in concrete challenges and moral problems which confronted society under new conditions.

Over the years a casuistry, a fixed set of answers to moral dilemmas, had been developed. However, by its nature, a casuistry can never be complete, leading to a search for more general rules or principles. From this developed probabilism, where the ultimate criterion was not truth, but the certainty of not choosing evil. Developed principally by Bartolomé de Medina and continued by Gabriel Vázquez and Francisco Suárez, Probabilism became the most important school of moral thought in the coming centuries.

=== The &quot;De auxiliis&quot; controversy ===
The &quot;De auxiliis&quot; controversy was a dispute between Jesuits and Dominicans which occurred at the end of the 16th century. The topic of the controversy was grace and predestination, that is to say how one could reconcile the liberty or free will of humans with divine omniscience. In 1582 the Jesuit Prudencio Montemayor and Fray Luis de León spoke publicly about human liberty. Domingo Báñez considered that they gave free will too great a weight and that they used terminology that sounded heretical; he denounced them to the Spanish Inquisition, accusing them of Pelagianism, a belief in human free will to the detriment of the doctrine of original sin and the grace granted by God. Montemayor and de León were banned from teaching and prohibited from defending such ideas.

Báñez was then denounced to the Holy Office by Leon, who accused him of &quot;committing the error of Lutheranism&quot;, that is of following the doctrines of Martin Luther. According to Lutheran doctrine, man is &quot;dead in his trespasses&quot; (Ephesians 2:1) as a consequence of original sin and cannot save himself by his own merit; only God can save man, &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot; (Ephesians 2:8–9) Báñez was acquitted.

Nonetheless, this did not end the dispute, which Luis de Molina continued with his &quot;Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis&quot; (1588). This is considered the best expression of the Jesuit position. The polemic continued over the course of years, including an attempt by the Dominicans to get Pope Clement VIII to condemn the &quot;Concordia&quot; of de Molina. Finally Paul V in 1607 recognized the liberty of Dominicans and Jesuits to defend their ideas, prohibiting that either side of this disagreement be characterized as heresy.

===The existence of evil in the world===
The existence of evil in a world created and ruled by an infinitely good and powerful God has long been viewed as paradoxical. (See Problem of evil). Vitoria reconciled the paradox by arguing first that free will is a gift from God to each person. It is impossible that each person will always freely choose only the good. Thus, evil results from man&#x27;s ability not to choose good, by virtue of his free will.

<text>Brooklyn is a mostly residential neighborhood in southeast Portland, Oregon. It sits along the east side of the Willamette River in the vicinity of Reed College. Founded as a neighborhood in the late 1860s, the neighborhood today is a middle-class area comprising mainly single family homes, interspersed with remaining industrial sites along the river and a large railyard. This railyard was home to Southern Pacific 4449 as well as several other large antique steam and diesel-electric locomotives.

==History==

The area of the neighborhood was inhabited by Clackamas people before settlement by colonizers. The first documented colonizer of the area was Giddeon Tibbets, who was granted the stolen land in the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. He arrived in the area in 1851, building a family home and grist mill. Tibbets renamed the area &quot;Brookland&quot; due to the river, creeks, and lakes on his property. In 1868 Tibbets subdivided the property into smaller lots and allowed the Oregon Central Railroad to cross the property. The rail line and the subdivision quickly brought in a large number of residents to the neighborhood, which acquired its current name of &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. The influx led to the construction of a town square at the corner of Powell Boulevard and Milwaukie Avenue. In the 1890s, the neighborhood received an influx of largely Roman Catholic German-Americans. While many of the German street/landmark names were changed during World War I, the neighborhood continues to bear the traces of this period today, with several older German-American businesses, as well as the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and the 1891 Johan Poulsen House. In 1908, The contracting firm Geibisch and Joplin built this neighborhood&#x27;s original sewer system.

In the 1920s, the neighborhood changed drastically as a part of a citywide construction effort. The construction of the Ross Island Bridge over the Willamette destroyed the town square. At the same time, many of the streams and ponds in the neighborhood were filled in. The construction of McLoughlin Boulevard (Oregon Route 99E) severed the neighborhood&#x27;s connection to the Willamette waterfront. The construction of an overpass on 17th avenue also divided the neighborhood in two.

By the 1960s, the neighborhood had acquired the reputation as being poverty-stricken. During this time, future Portland mayor Tom Potter began his police career in Portland as a beat officer in the neighborhood, as well as nearby Sellwood to the south. According to Potter, he acquired many of the basic tenets of his philosophy of community policing while as a young officer in the neighborhood. Potter became involved in the Brooklyn Action Corps (BAC), a community organization that was founded during this time to combat the poverty, crime, and drugs that were afflicting the neighborhood.

By the 1980s, the neighborhood had undergone a nearly complete turnaround. Today it is regarded as among southeast Portland&#x27;s most desirable residential neighborhoods. The construction of the Eastbank Esplanade in Portland allowed the neighborhood to regain its connection to the Willamette River, and the opening of the Orange Line light rail, completed in September 2015, has created easier mass-transit access to downtown.

<doc id="1062869" wikidata="Q8013991" url="?curid=1062869" title="William Kidston">
<text>William Kidston (17 August 1849 – 25 October 1919) was an Australian bookseller, politician and Premier of Queensland, from January 1906 to November 1907 and again from February 1908 to February 1911.

==Early life==
William Kidston was born in Falkirk, Scotland on 17 August 1849, the son of an ironworker. He became an apprentice ironmoulder at age 13. He married Margaret Scott in 1874. Dissatisfied with ironmoulding, he emigrated to New South Wales with his family in 1882, and moved again to Queensland, arriving in Rockhampton at 1883.

In Rockhampton, Kidston started a new career as a bookseller. During the early 1890s, growing industrial unrest pitted the newly formed trade union movement against the conservative colonial government led by Thomas McIlwraith in a series of strikes. The 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike led to the government deploying military forces. Kidston, a member of the local militia, was in strong support of the strikers, and received a court martial when he refused enrolment as a special constable in the anti-strike force.

==Ascent into Parliament==

The unionists&#x27; defeat at the hands of the government prompted the labour movement to aim for political representation in the Parliament of Queensland. The Australian Labour Federation (ALF) sought to repeal the antiquated anti-striking laws that had been used against the strikers. Kidston wrote a poem, entitled &quot;The Ballot is the Thing,&quot; in support of the unionists&#x27; goals. Kidston became the main ALF figure in Rockhampton and campaigned for electoral reform – abolition of plural voting, and extension of the franchise. In addition to the cause of the labour movement, Kidston also supported the separatist organisations in Rockhampton that sought to make Central Queensland a separate colony. Kidston stood unsuccessfully as a separatist candidate for Rockhampton in 1893. In the elections of 1896 he was elected as an endorsed Labor candidate.

In Parliament, Kidston began agitating for a broad coalition of progressive elements to defeat the conservative &quot;Continuous Ministry&quot; now led by Hugh Nelson and achieve electoral reform. Such overtures met with little enthusiasm from either the Labor or Liberal elements. In 1899 he was re-elected and campaigned against Federation of the Australian colonies, believing that the proposed Constitution would disadvantage Queensland financially and disappointed by the provision leaving the creation of new states in the hands of the existing state parliaments. He was again re-elected in 1902, by which stage the separatist movement was dying down.

The faltering Ministerialists were beginning to fracture, and when Robert Philp resigned as premier following a narrow win on an important vote, Kidston briefly found himself Treasurer in 1899 in the world&#x27;s first parliamentary labour government under Anderson Dawson. The government lasted only a week before it was defeated on the floor of parliament, an experience which convinced Kidston of the necessity of seeking support outside of the ALF proper.

In 1903 an alliance of disaffected Ministerialists, Liberals and the ALF brought down Philp&#x27;s government and replaced him with Arthur Morgan. Kidston, a close friend of Morgan, again became treasurer. He was, along with William Browne, one of two Labor members of the ministry. After Browne&#x27;s death in 1904, Kidston became the most senior Labor minister. The parliamentary situation, with equal numbers for both the Morgan-Kidston coalition and the ex-Ministerialists, proved unwieldy, and an election was called. Labor became the largest party in the parliament but Kidston was content to let Morgan retain the dominant role in the coalition. Kidston defended Labor&#x27;s coalition with Morgan, arguing that it had resulted in a public works programme, and fairer taxation and electoral systems.

==Premiership==

By 1905, Kidston&#x27;s collaboration with non-Labor elements had provoked criticism from sections of the Labor movement, and when the Labor convention in May endorsed a socialist objective, Kidston protested vigorously. When Hugh Nelson died in January 1906, Morgan took his place as president of the Queensland Legislative Council, which led to Kidston&#x27;s ascension as premier. In May 1907, he announced the formation of his own political party, to which a majority of the Labor members in parliament declared allegiance.

The early years of Kidston&#x27;s premiership were dominated by his fight with the conservative Legislative Council, which rejected much of his legislation. In 1908, when Kidston asked the governor, Lord Chelmsford, to appoint more Council members to secure passage of his legislation, Chelmsford refused and Kidston resigned in protest. Robert Philp was commissioned as premier but, without a majority in the Legislative Assembly, could not govern. Chelmsford attempted to dissolve the Assembly, but before he could do so, the Assembly blocked supply. The paralysis was ended when Chelmsford dissolved the Assembly, guaranteed supply in his capacity as governor, and called an election.

Kidston&#x27;s party won the most seats, and formed a government with Labor&#x27;s support. Kidston immediately acted to curtail the council&#x27;s powers. He also proceeded with laws enacting electoral reform and the establishment of Wages Boards. However, he lost Labor&#x27;s support when he authorised private railway construction in the state, but remained in office, supported by Philp&#x27;s conservative grouping. In late 1908, presaging the Fusion in the Commonwealth Parliament, Kidston&#x27;s and Philp&#x27;s parties merged into one anti-Labor force. After several of his former supporters deserted him, Kidston called another election in October 1909, which his Liberal Party won comfortably.

After lengthy negotiations, Kidston succeeded in ensuring amendments to the Commonwealth Constitution to provide the States with returned customs and excise revenue. He enacted further electoral reform by redistributing electorate boundaries, abolishing dual-member electorates, and entrenching one vote one value, though that would later be undone through malapportionments by subsequent governments. , he remains the last person to make a comeback as Premier of Queensland after losing the position.

In 1911, he resigned to take up a position as President of the Land Court, which he maintained until 1919.

He died in October that year in Coorparoo and was buried in South Rockhampton Cemetery.

<text>Westport, Nova Scotia is a village in Digby County, Nova Scotia and it is located on Brier Island in the Bay of Fundy. As of 2021, the population was 193.

==History==
The settlement began with the arrival of David Welch and his family in 1769, as well as the Morrells. This was followed by the arrival of several more United Empire Loyalist families in 1783.

The village was incorporated in 1946.

A ferry service connects the village with Freeport, Nova Scotia on Long Island. A second ferry runs from Digby Neck to Long Island.

Joshua Slocum, the first person to sail solo around the world, grew up in Westport, where his mother was born. A monument in his memory was built on the southern end of the village.

Mathematician Roland Richardson was the principal of Westport&#x27;s high school from 1899 to 1902.

<text>Pey de Garros (modern Gascon: &quot;Pèir de Garròs&quot;; 1530–1585), was the most important Occitan poet of the Renaissance. He was instrumental in the evolution of the Gascon dialect into a literary language.

Garros was born at Lectoure, Gascony. He studied law, theology, and Hebrew at the University of Toulouse and served as the &quot;avocat-général&quot; of Pau for a time. He strove to restore the Gascon dialect to prominence, translating the Psalms into Gascon in 1565, as well as publishing a volume of poetry (&quot;Poesias Gasconas&quot;) in 1567. 

The translation was ordered by Queen Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, who decreed Calvinism to be the official faith in the Kingdom of Navarre, as well as commissioning Arnaud de Salette to produce a distinct Béarnese translation of the Psalms.

Garros died in Pau.

<doc id="1062901" wikidata="Q1424880" url="?curid=1062901" title="Orthogenesis">
<text>Orthogenesis, also known as orthogenetic evolution, progressive evolution, evolutionary progress, or progressionism, is an obsolete biological hypothesis that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in a definite direction towards some goal (teleology) due to some internal mechanism or &quot;driving force&quot;. According to the theory, the largest-scale trends in evolution have an absolute goal such as increasing biological complexity. Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and Henri Bergson.

The term &quot;orthogenesis&quot; was introduced by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor Eimer five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear (straight-line) model of directed evolution. With the emergence of the modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared; modern supporters include E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 1948, by stating that it implied &quot;some supernatural force&quot;. The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as &quot;the mysterious inner force&quot;. Despite this, many museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression that evolution is directed. 

The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse notes that in popular culture, evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the &quot;March of Progress&quot;, from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.

==Definition==

The term orthogenesis (from Ancient orthós, &quot;straight&quot;, and Ancient , &quot;origin&quot;) was first used by the biologist Wilhelm Haacke in 1893. Theodor Eimer was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as &quot;the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups&quot;.

In 1922, the zoologist Michael F. Guyer wrote:

According to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:

In 1988, Francisco J. Ayala defined progress as &quot;systematic change in a feature belonging to all the members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature&quot;. He argued that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggested that science should focus on the question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is &quot;improvement&quot;. This may be compared to Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality&quot;.

In 1989, Peter J. Bowler defined orthogenesis as:

In 1996, Michael Ruse defined orthogenesis as &quot;the view that evolution has a kind of momentum of its own that carries organisms along certain tracks&quot;.

==History==
===Medieval===
The possibility of progress is embedded in the mediaeval great chain of being, with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in Aristotle&#x27;s biology, from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The medieval chain, as in Ramon Lull&#x27;s &quot;Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind&quot;, 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.

===Pre-Darwinian===
The orthogenesis hypothesis had a significant following in the 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as Lamarckism were being proposed. The French zoologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) himself accepted the idea, and it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, the hypothesized mechanism of which resembled the &quot;mysterious inner force&quot; of orthogenesis. Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change, and in invertebrate paleontology thought there was a gradual and constant directional change. Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was teleological (had a definite goal). Charles Darwin himself rarely used the term &quot;evolution&quot; now so commonly used to describe his theory, because the term was strongly associated with orthogenesis, as had been common usage since at least 1647. His grandfather, the physician and polymath Erasmus Darwin, was both progressionist and vitalist, seeing &quot;the whole cosmos [as] a living thing propelled by an internal vital force&quot; towards &quot;greater perfection&quot;. Robert Chambers, in his popular anonymously published 1844 book &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; presented a sweeping narrative account of cosmic transmutation, culminating in the evolution of humanity. Chambers included detailed analysis of the fossil record.

===With Darwin===
Ruse observed that &quot;Progress &quot;(sic, his capitalisation)&quot; became essentially a nineteenth-century belief. It gave meaning to life—it offered inspiration—after the collapse [with Malthus&#x27;s pessimism and the shock of the French Revolution] of the foundations of the past.&quot;
The Baltic German biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876) argued for an orthogenetic force in nature, reasoning in a review of Darwin&#x27;s 1859 &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; that &quot;Forces which are not directed—so-called blind forces—can never produce order.&quot; 
In 1864, the Swiss anatomist Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905) presented his orthogenetic theory, &quot;heterogenesis&quot;, arguing for wholly separate lines of descent with no common ancestor.
In 1884, the Swiss botanist Carl Nägeli (1817–1891) proposed a version of orthogenesis involving an &quot;inner perfecting principle&quot;. Gregor Mendel died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an &quot;idioplasm&quot; transmitted inherited characteristics, dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics. According to Nägeli many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed. Charles Darwin saw this as a serious challenge, replying that &quot;There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual difference&quot;, but was unable to provide a specific answer without knowledge of genetics. Further, Darwin was himself somewhat progressionist, believing for example that &quot;Man&quot; was &quot;higher&quot; than the barnacles he studied.
Darwin indeed wrote in his 1859 &quot;Origin of Species&quot;:



In 1898, after studying butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, &quot;On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation&quot;. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance that would be difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book &quot;Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth&quot;. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer&#x27;s criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.

===Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Numerous versions of orthogenesis (see table) have been proposed. Debate centred on whether such theories were scientific, or whether orthogenesis was inherently vitalistic or essentially theological. For example, biologists such as Maynard M. Metcalf (1914), John Merle Coulter (1915), David Starr Jordan (1920) and Charles B. Lipman (1922) claimed evidence for orthogenesis in bacteria, fish populations and plants. In 1950, the German paleontologist Otto Schindewolf argued that variation tends to move in a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism. In 1964 George Gaylord Simpson argued that orthogenetic theories such as those promulgated by Du Noüy and Sinnott were essentially theology rather than biology.

Though evolution is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely consistent with the modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes been referred to as &quot;orthoselection&quot; but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.

Recent work has supported the mechanism and existence of mutation biased adaptation, meaning that limited local orthogenesis is now seen as possible.

==Theories==
For the columns for other philosophies of evolution (i.e., combined theories including any of Lamarckism, Mutationism, Natural selection, and Vitalism), &quot;yes&quot; means that person definitely supports the theory; &quot;no&quot; means explicit opposition to the theory; a blank means the matter is apparently not discussed, not part of the theory.


The various alternatives to Darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, &quot;bathmism&quot;, to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope&#x27;s complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.

==Status==

===In science===
The stronger versions of the orthogenetic hypothesis began to lose popularity when it became clear that they were inconsistent with the patterns found by paleontologists in the fossil record, which were non-rectilinear (richly branching) with many complications. The hypothesis was abandoned by mainstream biologists when no mechanism could be found that would account for the process, and the theory of evolution by natural selection came to prevail. The historian of biology Edward J. Larson commented that

The modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms it came to be held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.

By 1948, the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, as editor of the journal &quot;Evolution&quot;, made the use of the term &quot;orthogenesis&quot; taboo: &quot;It might be well to abstain from use of the word &#x27;orthogenesis&#x27; .. since so many of the geneticists seem to be of the opinion that the use of the term implies some supernatural force.&quot; For these and other reasons, belief in evolutionary progress has remained &quot;a persistent heresy&quot;, among evolutionary biologists including E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, although often denied or veiled. The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse wrote that &quot;some of the most significant of today&#x27;s evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism alive and well in their work.&quot; He argued that progressionism has harmed the status of evolutionary biology as a mature, professional science. Presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist, with humans at the top of the &quot;Tower of Time&quot; in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., while &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine could illustrate the history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man. Ruse noted that at the popular level, progress and evolution are simply synonyms, as they were in the nineteenth century, though confidence in the value of cultural and technological progress has declined.

The discipline of evolutionary developmental biology, however, is open to an expanded concept of heredity that incorporates the physics of self-organization. With its rise in the late 20th-early 21st centuries, ideas of constraint and preferred directions of morphological change have made a reappearance in evolutionary theory.

===In popular culture===

In popular culture, progressionist images of evolution are widespread. The historian Jennifer Tucker, writing in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, notes that Thomas Henry Huxley&#x27;s 1863 illustration comparing the skeletons of apes and humans &quot;has become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution.&quot; She calls its history extraordinary, saying that it is &quot;one of the most intriguing, and most misleading, drawings in the modern history of science.&quot; Nobody, Tucker observes, supposes that the &quot;monkey-to-man&quot; sequence accurately depicts Darwinian evolution. &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; had only one illustration, a diagram showing that random events create a process of branching evolution, a view that Tucker notes is broadly acceptable to modern biologists. But Huxley&#x27;s image recalled the great chain of being, implying with the force of a visual image a &quot;logical, evenly paced progression&quot; leading up to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, a view denounced by Stephen Jay Gould in &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;.

Popular perception, however, had seized upon the idea of linear progress. Edward Linley Sambourne&#x27;s &quot;Man is But a Worm&quot;, drawn for &quot;Punch&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, mocked the idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals, with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes, primitive men, a Victorian beau, and Darwin in a pose that according to Tucker recalls Michelangelo&#x27;s figure of Adam in his fresco adorning the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This was followed by a flood of variations on the evolution-as-progress theme, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s 1925 &quot;The Rise and Fall of Man&quot;, the sequence running from a chimpanzee to Neanderthal man, Socrates, and finally the lawyer William Jennings Bryan who argued for the anti-evolutionist prosecution in the Scopes Trial on the State of Tennessee law limiting the teaching of evolution. Tucker noted that Rudolph Franz Zallinger&#x27;s 1965 &quot;The Road to Homo Sapiens&quot; fold-out illustration in F. Clark Howell&#x27;s &quot;Early Man&quot;, showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man, fitted the palaeoanthropological discoveries &quot;not into a branching Darwinian scheme, but into the framework of the original Huxley diagram.&quot; Howell ruefully commented that the &quot;powerful and emotional&quot; graphic had overwhelmed his Darwinian text.

===Sliding between meanings===

Scientists, Ruse argues, continue to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like Richard Dawkins embed the idea of cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, memes, that act much like genes. Dawkins can speak of &quot;progressive rather than random ... trends in evolution&quot;. Dawkins and John Krebs deny the &quot;earlier [Darwinian] prejudice&quot; that there is anything &quot;inherently progressive about evolution&quot;, but, Ruse argues, the feeling of progress comes from evolutionary arms races which remain in Dawkins&#x27;s words &quot;by far the most satisfactory explanation for the existence of the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess&quot;.

Ruse concludes his detailed analysis of the idea of &quot;Progress&quot;, meaning a progressionist philosophy, in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary thought came out of that philosophy. Before Darwin, Ruse argues, evolution was just a pseudoscience; Darwin made it respectable, but &quot;only as popular science&quot;. &quot;There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years&quot;, until mathematicians such as Fisher provided &quot;both models and status&quot;, enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to &quot;people [biologists] still firmly committed to Progress&quot; as a philosophy.

==Facilitated variation==

Biology has largely rejected the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example is the development of wing pattern in some species of &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.

<text>Johann Joseph Fux (; – 13 February 1741) was an Austrian composer, music theorist and pedagogue of the late Baroque era. His most enduring work is not a musical composition but his treatise on counterpoint, &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;, which has become the single most influential book on the Palestrinian style of Renaissance polyphony.

==Life==
Fux&#x27;s exact date of birth is unknown. He was born to a peasant family in Hirtenfeld, Styria, Austria. Relatively little is known about his early life, but likely he went to nearby Graz for music lessons. In 1680 he was accepted at the Jesuit Ferdinandeum University there, where his musical talent became apparent. From 1685 until 1688 he served as organist at St. Moritz in Ingolstadt. Sometime during this period he must have made a trip to Italy, as evidenced by the strong influence of Corelli and Bolognese composers on his work of the time.

By the 1690s he was in Vienna, and attracted the attention of Emperor Leopold I with some masses he composed; the emperor was sufficiently impressed by them to assist him with his career after this point. In 1698, Leopold hired him as court composer. Fux traveled again to Italy, studying in Rome in 1700; it may have been here that he acquired the veneration for Palestrina which was so consequential for music pedagogy.
Fux became the Hofkapellmeister (head musician of the Wiener Hofmusikkapelle) in 1715, along with Antonio Caldara as his vice-Kapellmeister, and F.B. Conti as the court composer.

Fux served Leopold I until the latter&#x27;s death, and two more Habsburg emperors after that: Joseph I, and Charles VI, both of whom continued to employ him in high positions in the court. Fux was famous as a composer throughout this period, and stood out among his contemporaries as the highest ranking composer in the Holy Roman Empire. However, this renown gradually became eclipsed later in the 18th century as the Baroque style died out. Although his music until recently never regained favor, his mastery of counterpoint influenced countless composers through his treatise &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; (1725). Haydn largely taught himself counterpoint by reading it and recommended it to the young Beethoven. Mozart had a copy of it that he annotated.

==&quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;==

The &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; (Steps or Ascent to Mount Parnassus) is a theoretical and pedagogical work written by Fux in Latin in 1725, and translated into German by Lorenz Christoph Mizler in 1742. Fux dedicated it to Emperor Charles VI.

The work is divided into two major parts. In the first part, Fux presents a summary of the theory on &quot;Musica Speculativa,&quot; or the analysis of intervals as proportions between numbers. This section is in a simple lecture style, and looks at music from a purely mathematical angle, in a theoretical tradition that goes back, through the works of Renaissance theoreticians, to the Ancient Greeks. Fux explains that intervals in exact mathematical proportions result in larger and smaller half tones, and he also mentions that some organists added extra keys (split halves to use smaller and bigger half tones), but that adding extra keys on a keyboard was problematic and for this reason they divided every note in &quot;&quot; (two equal parts), resulting in equal temperament. He continues:
 The works of Mersenne, Cicero and Aristotle are among the several references quoted by Fux in this section.

The second part, on &quot;Musica Pratica,&quot; is the section of this treatise where the author presents his instruction on counterpoint, fugue, double counterpoint, a brief essay on musical taste, and his ideas on composing sacred music, writing in the &quot;a cappella&quot; and in the &quot;recitativo&quot; style. This part is in the form of a dialog, between a master (Aloysius, Latin for Luigi, who is meant to represent Palestrina&#x27;s ideas) and a student, Josephus, who represents Fux himself, a self-admitted admirer of Palestrina. At the outset, Fux states his purpose: &quot;to invent a simple method by which a novice can progress, step by step, to attain mastery in this art.&quot; and gives his opinion of contemporary practice: &quot;I shall not be deterred by the most ardent haters of school, nor by the corruptness of the times.&quot; He also states that theory without practice is useless, thus stressing practice over theory in his book.

While &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; is famous as the origin of the term &quot;species counterpoint&quot;, Fux was not the first one to invent the idea. In 1610, Girolamo Diruta, a composer of the Venetian school, published &quot;Il Transilvano&quot;, which presented the Renaissance polyphonic style as a series of types: one note against one note, two notes against one note, suspensions, and so forth. Fux&#x27;s work repeated some of Diruta&#x27;s, possibly coincidentally, since he is not known to have had a copy.

In species counterpoint, as given in Fux, the student is to master writing counterpoint in each species before moving on to the next. The species are, in order, note against note; two notes against one; four notes against one; ligature or suspensions (one note against one, but offset by half of the note value); and florid counterpoint, in which the other species are combined freely. Once all the species are mastered in two voices, the species are gone through again in three voices, and then in four voices. (Occasionally, in modern counterpoint textbooks, the third and fourth species are reversed with suspensions being taught before four notes against one.) Fux expressed the intention of adding sections on how to write counterpoint for more than four parts, indicating that rules in this area were to be &quot;less rigorously observed&quot;. However, citing his poor health as a result of gout and age, he chose to conclude the book as it stood.

Modern counterpoint education is greatly indebted to &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;, and Fux presented the ideas with such clarity and focus that both subsequent and modern counterpoint texts continue to cite his work, from the book by Albrechtsberger (&quot;Gründliche Anweisung zur Komposition&quot;) to 20th century examples such as the book by Knud Jeppesen (&quot;Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century&quot;). Furthermore, &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; is a noteworthy historical document in that it clearly delineates the stylistic distinction of the entire baroque era between an antique and sacred style and a more modern and largely secular style.

The Latin edition of Fux&#x27;s &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; from the year 1725, translated by Lorenz Christoph Mizler, is the only surviving book of J.S. Bach&#x27;s personal library of theoretical works. As Mizler was a student of J.S. Bach, musicologist Christoph Wolff has suggested that Bach may have played some part in persuading Mizler to translate the treatise.

==Works==

In addition to writing &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;, Fux also composed numerous sacred and secular works. Fux&#x27;s compositions were catalogued by Ludwig Ritter von Köchel who also catalogued Mozart&#x27;s works.

==Sacred compositions==
Fux&#x27;s sacred works include masses (such as &quot;Missa canonica,&quot; &quot;Missa Corporis Christi,&quot;), requiems, oratorios (including &quot;Santa Dimpna, Infanta d&#x27;Irlanda, K 300a&quot; (1702), &quot;Il fonte della salute, K 293 &quot;(1716)), litanies, Vespers settings, motets, graduals, offertories, Marian antiphons (consisting of 21 settings of &quot;Alma Redemptoris mater&quot;, 22 settings of &quot;Ave Regina&quot;, 9 of &quot;Regina coeli&quot;, and 17 of &quot;Salve regina&quot;), settings of the text &quot;Sub Tuum Praesidium&quot;, hymns (many of which are lost), Sequences, Introits, Communion hymns, German sacred songs (all lost), and other sacred works.

Some of Fux&#x27;s masses (along with Caldara and others) utilized the canon (imitative counterpoint in its strictest form) as a compositional technique, one of the telltale signs of the stile antico. Other indications of the &quot;stile antico&quot; include large note values (whole, half, or quarter notes).

However, while most associate Fux with composing in the &quot;stile antico&quot;, referring to him as the &quot;Austrian Palestrina&quot;, due to his treatise Gradus ad Parnassum, he also had the ability to compose in the &quot;stile moderno&quot; as well, evident in his oratorios, such as &quot;Santa Dimpna, Infanta d&#x27;Irlandia&quot;. For instance, many of the movements in the second half of &quot;Santa Dimpna&quot; make use of da capo aria form, and the eight (surviving) arias demonstrate the baroque concept of the &quot;affect&quot;, as demonstrated by the vocal &quot;coloratura&quot; and instrumental figures.

Fux, along with other composers, such as Hofer, Biber, and Caldara established a solid repertory of Catholic church music in southern Germany and Austria, despite the presence of the better-known Protestant church music in northern Germany.

==Secular compositions==
Besides sacred works, Fux was a composer of vocal and instrumental music. His works include 19 operas, 29 partitas, 10 oratorios, and about 80 masses. Fux&#x27;s instrumental compositions include 50 church sonatas, Concentus musico-instrumentalis (1710), and keyboard works. Fux&#x27;s compositions for Clavier include five Partitas, a 20-minute Capriccio, a Ciaccona, an Harpeggio Prelude and Fugue, an Aria Passaggiata, and a set of twelve Minuets.

The Concentus musico-instrumentalis is a cycle of seven partitas scored for woodwind, brass, and string instruments. This cycle, published in 1701, was to Joseph, King of Rome. Its cosmopolitan admixture of French, Italian, and German movements and its festive characteristics can be found in Fux&#x27;s keyboard suites, which are heavily ornamented and treble-dominated. Most Italian operas of that period were concentrated on the solo aria. Whereas, Fux&#x27;s operas employ an ensemble of solo singers and the large arias often use a concertizing solo instrument. Fux&#x27;s emphasis on contrapuntal structures was conservative and represented the older manner of treating musical texture.

Fux&#x27;s early operas show characteristics of the late 17th century such as using arioso passages in recitatives. His style is primarily a combination of his preference for contrapuntal textures, a vivid mastery of vocal and instrumental rhetoric and Italianate ornamentation, and colorful use of obbligato scoring. Compared to his Italian contemporaries, it is Fux&#x27;s manipulation of the da capo aria that represents his exceptional sense of dramma per musica: his scoring, texture, and motivic-thematic integration allow an individual style to arise while the idealized passions of the Affektenlehre attain dramatic life.

Most of his dramatic operas were premiered at the Hoftheater, Vienna; otherwise given below. List of Fux&#x27;s 19 operas:
*&quot;Il fato monarchico, festa teatrale&quot; (18 Feb. 1700; music not extant)
*&quot;Neo-exoriens phosphorus, id est neo-electus et infulatus praesul Mellicensis&quot;, Latin school opera (1701; music not extant)
*&quot;L&#x27;offendere per amare ovvera La Telesilla&quot;, dramma per musica (25 June 1702; music not extant)
*&quot;La clemenza d&#x27; Augusto&quot;, poemetto drammatico (15 Nov. 1702; music not extant)
*&quot;Julo Ascanio re d&#x27;Alba&quot;, poemetto drammatico (19 March 1708)
*&quot;Pulcheria&quot;, poemetto drammatico (21 June 1708)
*&quot;Il mese di Marzo, consecrato a Marte&quot;, componimento per musica (19 March 1709)
*&quot;Gli ossequi della note&quot;, componimento per musica (15 July 1709)
*&quot;La decima fatica d&#x27;Ercolo, ovvero La Sconfitta di Gerione in Spagna&quot;, componimento pastorale-eroico (1 Oct. 1710)
*&quot;Dafne in lauro&quot;, componimento per camera (1 Oct. 1714)
*&quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, componimento da camera per musica (1 Oct. 1715)
*&quot;Angelica vincitrice di Alcina&quot;, festa teatrale (14 Sept. 1716)
*&quot;Diana placate&quot;, componimento da camera (19 Nov. 1717)
*&quot;Elisa&quot;, festa teatrale per musica (Laxenburg, 28 Aug. 1719)
*&quot;Psiche&quot;, coponimento da camera per musica (19 Nov. 1720)
*&quot;Le nozze di Aurora&quot;, festa teatrale per musica (6 Oct. 1722)
*&quot;Constanza e Fortezza&quot;, festa teatrale (Prague, 28 Aug. 1723) – his notable opera
*&quot;Giunone placata&quot;, festa teatrale per musica (19 Nov. 1725)
*&quot;La corona d&#x27;Arianna&quot;, festa teatrale (28 Aug. 1731)

The festive opera &quot;Constanza e Fortezza&quot; (Constancy and Strength), with a libretto by Pietro Pariati (1665–1733), was Fux&#x27;s most notable opera. It was performed twice in a specially designed open-air theatre in Prague Castle on the occasion of the coronation of Charles VI as King of Bohemia in 1723. The set was designed by the court theatre architect Giuseppe Galli-Bibiena (1696–1756). This work is regarded as a festive coronation opera because both performances of this opera took place a few days before the coronation of Charles VI as King of Bohemia and of his consort Elisabeth Christina as Queen. There was an issue of the double celebratory function of this opera – coronation of Charles VI and Elisabeth Christina&#x27;s birthday.

<doc id="1062917" wikidata="Q2304007" url="?curid=1062917" title="List of James Bond allies">
<text>This is a list of allies of &quot;James Bond&quot; who appear throughout the film series and novels.

== MI6 ==

=== M ===
M is a Rear Admiral of the Royal Navy, and the head of the Secret Intelligence Service. Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as 24 films. M has been portrayed by Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, John Huston and Edward Fox.

=== Miss Moneypenny ===
Miss Moneypenny is the secretary to M. The films depict her as having a reserved romantic interest in Bond, although Fleming&#x27;s novels do not imply such a relationship while the John Gardner and Raymond Benson novels emphasise it more. In the film series, Moneypenny has been portrayed by Lois Maxwell, Barbara Bouchet, Pamela Salem, Caroline Bliss, Samantha Bond and Naomie Harris.

=== Q ===
Q (standing for Quartermaster) is the head of Q Branch (or later Q Division), the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Service. His real name is Major Boothroyd, but Bond and M never use his name. He has appeared in 20 of 23 Eon Bond films; all except &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. The character was also featured in the non-Eon Bond films &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. He has been portrayed by Desmond Llewelyn for most of the films, and by Peter Burton, Geoffrey Bayldon, Alec McCowen, John Cleese (first as R in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;), and Ben Whishaw.

=== Bill Tanner ===

Bill Tanner is MI6&#x27;s Chief of Staff. Tanner is a Bond ally appearing regularly in the novels of Ian Fleming and John Gardner, as well as in Kingsley Amis&#x27; &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;, but did not become a regular cinematic character until the Brosnan and Craig era of films. Among his most prominent cinematic roles was in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), in which Tanner was given a bigger part while M was &quot;on leave&quot;, due to Bernard Lee&#x27;s death that prevented him from reprising his role as M in the film. He otherwise has minor roles in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), and appears in two of the four Brosnan films. Tanner appears in four of the five Craig films, taking on an increased role as M&#x27;s chief aide and a friend and ally of Bond.

In 1965, Amis wrote the authorised spin-off &quot;The Book of Bond, or Every Man His Own 007&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek guide to being a spy. The book is not credited to Amis, but rather to Lt. Col. William &quot;Bill&quot; Tanner.
* Michael Goodliffe (1974) (uncredited)
* James Villiers (1981)
* Michael Kitchen (1995–1999)
* Rory Kinnear (2008–present)

=== Mary Goodnight ===
Mary Goodnight is Bond&#x27;s second personal secretary. She first appears in the novel &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, then again in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. By the time of her appearance in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, she has been assigned to the Kingston station of the service, although she has a much larger role. She appears later in the Jeffery Deaver novel &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;. She is shown to have a strong friendship with Miss Moneypenny.

She appears in the film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; as a Bond girl, played by Britt Ekland.

=== Loelia Ponsonby ===
Loelia Ponsonby is Bond&#x27;s shared personal secretary in many of the Bond novels. She is also the secretary for 008 and 0011, both of whom share an office with Bond. She retires and is replaced in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; by Mary Goodnight after she marries a member of the Baltic Exchange. For the films, her flirtatious relationship with Bond is transferred to and replaced by Miss Moneypenny. Ponsonby nearly made an appearance in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, but she was removed from the final draft. The name of the character may be based on the Duchess of Westminster of the same name.

=== Charles Robinson ===
Charles Robinson is the Deputy Chief of Staff at MI6. He first appears in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, then later in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, and &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. Played by Colin Salmon, Robinson appears to be M&#x27;s right-hand man and is often seen at her side. When Bond reports in with MI6, he often does so to Robinson.

=== Smithers ===
One of Q&#x27;s assistants, Smithers makes two film appearances: in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;Octopussy&quot;. He is played by Jeremy Bulloch. He is a distinct character from Colonel Smithers, a Bank of England official whom Bond consults in the novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and its film version.

=== 00 agents ===
The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the elite of the Secret Service. Agents with the 00 prefix have proven themselves capable enough in the field to be entrusted with the licence to kill: the authorisation to, at their own discretion, commit acts of assassination and other controversial activities in order to complete their missions, without having to first seek permission from headquarters.

The following 00 agents have been referenced onscreen in the James Bond films. Additional 00 agents, ranging from 001 to 0012, have been referenced in literature and in comic strips.
* 002 – Mentioned in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, named Bill Fairbanks and killed by Francisco Scaramanga. A different 002 (name not revealed) appears during the opening sequence of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.
* 003 – Body found in a snowbank at the start of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;.
* 004 – Killed during the opening sequence of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.
* 005 – Seen attending a meeting during &quot;Thunderball&quot;.
* 006 – Named Alec Trevelyan, a one-time ally and friend of Bond who is presumed dead for nine years; he is the primary antagonist in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.
* 007 – Can refer to both James Bond and Nomi, MI6 agent holder of the codename in &quot;No Time to Die&quot;.
* 008 – Mentioned by M in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as a potential replacement for Bond if his mission fails. Bond also mentions this to Goldfinger himself. 008 is also mentioned in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; as an alternate choice to assassinate General Pushkin if Bond refuses to do so.
* 009 – Seen early in &quot;Octopussy&quot;, killed by twins working for General Orlov. However, 009 still manages to complete his mission by returning a forged Fabergé egg and Bond later avenges his death. 009 is also mentioned in the film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; as the agent who initially shoots Renard. 009 is mentioned again in &quot;Spectre&quot; as the intended recipient of the Aston Martin DB10 after it was reassigned from Bond. Bond steals the car for use in his own mission, leaving 009 without it.

Additional unidentified 00 agents are seen briefly in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

== Recurring allies ==

=== Felix Leiter ===

* Jack Lord (1962)
* Cec Linder (1964)
* Rik Van Nutter (1965)
* Norman Burton (1971)
* David Hedison (1973 &amp; 1989)
* Bernie Casey (1983)
* John Terry (1987)
* Jeffrey Wright (2006, 2008 &amp; 2021)

A revised version of the character of Felix Leiter appears in the 1954 television adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. In that version, Leiter is a British agent named Clarence Leiter and is played by Michael Pate.

=== General Anatoly Gogol ===
General Anatoly Gogol is the head of the KGB in the films &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Moonraker&quot;, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Octopussy&quot;, and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. In his final appearance, in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, the character has become a post-Glasnost envoy in the Foreign Service and is succeeded as head of the KGB by General Pushkin. In the end credits of the film, his first name is listed as &quot;Anatol&quot;, although in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, M referred to him as Alexis.

Gogol is played by Walter Gotell (who also played SPECTRE henchman Morzeny in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;). With the KGB, Gogol often allies himself with Bond to stave off the possibility of war with the West, an ideal that is not always shared with his comrades—such as when he argues against Soviet General Orlov&#x27;s reckless proposal of military conquest in &quot;Octopussy&quot;, and uncovers Orlov&#x27;s theft of priceless jewels from the Kremlin.

Only in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; does Gogol act as an enemy, but even then his actions are more those of a respectful competitor. He particularly opposes the methods of the villain Max Zorin in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. General Gogol has a secretary named Miss Rublevitch, played by Eva Rueber-Staier, being some sort of Soviet counterpart to Miss Moneypenny.

=== Sir Frederick Gray ===
Sir Frederick Gray is the Minister of Defence in the films &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;Moonraker&quot;, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Octopussy&quot;, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. He is always listed in the closing credits as &quot;Minister of Defence&quot;, and is played by Geoffrey Keen.

In &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, after being briefed on his forthcoming mission to Egypt, Bond holds a private discussion with Gray, to whom he refers as &quot;Freddie&quot;. It is never revealed how they know each other well enough for Bond to be so informal. In the next few films, Bond calls Gray &quot;Minister&quot;, for most of their scenes include other officials. It is also suggested that he belongs to no particular political party; direct references are made to Margaret Thatcher in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, even though he had also held the post in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot; – which were both made during the government led by James Callaghan.

=== Marc-Ange Draco ===
Draco is the head of the Unione Corse, a (real-life) major European crime syndicate and a rival of SPECTRE. He appears in the novels &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, working as an ally of Bond; and &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot;, where 007&#x27;s former father-in-law turns out to be linked to the villain of the Union. He also appears in the film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, portrayed by Gabriele Ferzetti.

=== René Mathis ===
Mathis is a long-time friend of Bond and an agent of the French secret service Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage (SDECE). He is a main character in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and a supporting character in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; and &quot;Devil May Care&quot;. Mathis captures the SMERSH villain Rosa Klebb, and uses cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep Bond alive until a doctor arrives after Bond is poisoned by Klebb. In &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, it is revealed that he originally met Bond on assignment in Monte Carlo prior to World War II, when Bond was trying to crack down on a group of Romanians cheating at a local casino with the use of invisible ink. Mathis is reassigned to work with Bond at the time of the events in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, where he poses as a radio salesman, assisting Bond and introducing him to Vesper Lynd.

In the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, Bill Tanner asks Moneypenny to send a copy of SPECTRE&#x27;s ransom demand letter to Mathis at the Deuxième Bureau. In &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot;, he is captured by the head of the Union &quot;Le Gérant&quot; and is blinded with lasers. Bond later saves him from imprisonment. A younger version of Mathis appears in the &quot;Young Bond&quot; short story &quot;A Hard Man to Kill&quot;.

The characters of Mathis and Vesper Lynd are combined to form Valerie Mathis in the original 1954 &quot;Climax!&quot; production of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Mathis first appears onscreen in the 1967 version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, played by Duncan Macrae. Here, he is a police officer, prompting Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers) to state that it has been worrying him that despite his supposed nationality, Mathis has a Scots accent: &quot;Aye, it worries me too&quot;, Mathis replies. In the 2006 adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Mathis is an MI6 agent, played by Giancarlo Giannini. Mathis is suspected of being a traitor and informant to Le Chiffre and arrested. Upon the discovery that Vesper was the real traitor, Bond advises that MI6 should continue interrogating Mathis because his innocence has not yet been established. Mathis appears again in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, having retired to an Italian villa given to him by MI6. He joins Bond to bring down Dominic Greene, only to be killed by corrupt policemen working for Greene. Before dying, Mathis asks Bond to forgive Vesper and make peace with her death.

=== May Maxwell ===
May Maxwell is Bond&#x27;s loyal and elderly Scottish housekeeper, who is often mentioned in Ian Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels. She also appears in several John Gardner novels and the Anthony Horowitz novel &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot;, as well making a cameo appearance in the first &quot;Young James Bond&quot; novel, &quot;SilverFin&quot;. She has yet to make an appearance in any of the Bond films. May is named after the housekeeper of Ivar Bryce, a friend of Fleming.

=== Sir James Molony ===
A noted neurologist whose expertise is frequently employed by M and the Secret Services, Molony appears in the novels &quot;Dr No&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

=== Sheriff J. W. Pepper ===
Sheriff John Wayne (J. W.) Pepper is a parish sheriff in Louisiana. He appears in the films &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. Played by Clifton James, he is mostly used as comic relief.

In &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, he chases Bond&#x27;s and Kananga&#x27;s speedboats, believing them to be young people joyriding, but Felix Leiter later has one of the sheriff&#x27;s superiors introducing him to Bond&#x27;s mission. His first film appearance also reveals a comedic rivalry with Louisiana State Police troopers, who are shown kidding him when his car is destroyed by a fallen speedboat of Kananga&#x27;s. After a chase that destroys several police cars, the state police tell him that Bond is a spy and Pepper quips, &quot;On whose side?&quot;

In &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, a vacationing Pepper is shown having a boat tour in Thailand and briefly seeing Bond on another boat. He is later seen trying an AMC Hornet that Bond steals from a showroom, and, convinced he is chasing communists, helps Bond in the subsequent car chase with Francisco Scaramanga&#x27;s AMC Matador, only to be arrested by the Royal Thai Police together with the British operative.

Both of Pepper&#x27;s appearances, particularly in the latter film, have been criticised by some Bond fans who view him as symptomatic of the overly comic and slapstick nature of some of the Moore-era movies. Roger Moore said &quot;He gave my first two films a great, fun character&quot;, on actor Clifton James&#x27;s death.

=== Quarrel ===
Quarrel is a Cayman Islander living in Jamaica. He first appears in the novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; as Bond&#x27;s guide while 007 is investigating Mr. Big. Quarrel later appears in the novel &quot;Dr. No&quot; to help Bond infiltrate Dr. Julius No&#x27;s island, Crab Key. The only Bond film in which Quarrel appears is the 1962 film &quot;Dr. No&quot;, played by John Kitzmiller where, as in the novel, he is killed by Dr. No&#x27;s mythical &quot;dragon&quot;, which is actually a flamethrower-equipped vehicle.

As the films were made out of sequence from the novels, for the film adaptation of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Quarrel was changed to his son Quarrel Jr., played by Roy Stewart, whom Bond teams up with, helping him destroy Dr. Kananga&#x27;s poppy fields.

=== John Strangways and Mary Trueblood ===
John Strangways is a former Lieutenant Commander in the special branch of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He makes his first appearance in the novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; as the chief Secret Service agent in the Caribbean. Strangways is roughly 35 years old and wears a black patch over one eye. He later appears in the novel &quot;Dr. No&quot;, where he and his Number 2, Mary Trueblood (a former Chief Officer in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service), are assassinated for prying into Dr. Julius No&#x27;s business. Mary Trueblood is based on Fleming&#x27;s secretary from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Una Trueblood.

Strangways makes his only appearance in the films in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, where, as in the novel, he is killed for investigating the title character. Unlike in the novel, however, Strangways does not wear an eyepatch in the film. He is portrayed by Timothy Moxon and voiced by Robert Rietty (who later voiced villains Emilio Largo in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and Ernst Stavro Blofeld in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;). Mary is portrayed by Dolores Keator and dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl; both were Jamaican residents and were not in London for the final dubbing of the film.

=== Tiger Tanaka ===

Tiger Tanaka is an ally to Bond in the novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; and its film adaptation. He is the head of the Japanese Secret Service (&quot;Koan-Chosa-Kyoku&quot;) and resides within a secret underground office complex beneath the streets of Tokyo, his identity being the most closely guarded secret in Japan. Tanaka helps Bond disguise himself to look Japanese so that Blofeld will not recognise him. Tanaka arranges for Bond to marry a girl native to the land, Kissy Suzuki, in order to provide extra cover. In the film, Tanaka is portrayed by Tetsurō Tamba. He supplies an army of ninjas to attack Ernst Stavro Blofeld and leads the attack on Blofeld&#x27;s volcano base. Tanaka also appears in the novel &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot; and in the Dynamite Entertainment-published spin-off comic book, &quot;Felix Leiter&quot;.

In the novel, the character was based on one of Fleming&#x27;s friends, Torao Saito – although he was not connected to Japanese intelligence, but was in fact a well-known polymath in Japan, being a journalist, writer, photographer and architect.

=== Ronnie Vallance ===
Vallance appears in four of the Bond novels: &quot;Moonraker&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; and &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, as well as two of the short stories: &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot; and &quot;Risico&quot;. He is the head of Special Branch, with the Metropolitan Police rank of Assistant Commissioner, and the boss of Gala Brand.

=== Jack Wade ===
Jack Wade is an American CIA agent who appears in the films &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. He is played by Joe Don Baker. Eight years before &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Baker played villain Brad Whitaker in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.

=== Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky ===
Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky (Russian: Вaлeнтин Дмитриeвич Жуковский) is a former KGB agent turned Russian mafia head who runs a bar, a casino, and a caviar factory. When he was younger (and a KGB agent), a conflict with Bond ended with Bond shooting Zukovsky in the leg, causing him to walk with a limp. However, after leaving the KGB, Zukovsky does not hold a grudge towards Bond, especially when dealing with Bond means turning a profit. Played by Robbie Coltrane, Zukovsky makes two appearances in the films, his first being in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; before being shot and mortally wounded by Elektra King in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. He lives long enough after being shot to execute a trick shot using his cane gun, enabling Bond to escape King&#x27;s trap.

=== Dr. Madeleine Swann ===

Dr. Madeleine Swann is a psychiatrist, daughter of Mr. White, who assists Bond in his mission and becomes his love interest in the film &quot;Spectre&quot; and continues to be a central character in the subsequent film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;.

== Film allies == 
This section lists allies who each appear in only one film.

(*) Robert Brown also played &#x27;M&#x27; in &quot;Octopussy&quot;, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; and &quot;Licence To Kill&quot;.

<doc id="1062924" wikidata="Q10678007" url="?curid=1062924" title="Steeltown">
<text>Steeltown is the second studio album by Scottish band Big Country. The album was recorded at ABBA&#x27;s Polar Studios in Stockholm with Steve Lillywhite producing. It was released on 19 October 1984, in the UK and 29 October 1984, in the United States. It was released on CD only in Germany, as well as remastered and reissued there.

&quot;Steeltown&quot; is the band&#x27;s only UK number 1 album, topping the chart for 1 week in October 1984. The title track &quot;Steeltown&quot; was written about the town of Corby, telling how many Scots went to work at the Stewarts &amp; Lloyds steelworks when it opened in 1935, at the height of the Great Depression, but later found themselves unemployed when the steelworks declined in the early 1980s.

The 1996 reissue contains all of the B-sides from the album&#x27;s single releases as well as the extended version of non-album single &quot;Wonderland&quot;.

&quot;East of Eden&quot; was the only Top 20 single from the album, reaching number 17 in the UK Singles Chart.

==Reception==

Critic Fred Schruers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a glowing review, writing:
Some critics reacted negatively towards the album, calling it muddled and overly dense. The album&#x27;s relative failure has been attributed to the fact that many American and international fans couldn&#x27;t relate to its themes and lyrics, which dealt with the misfortunes of Scottish workers and contained references to British politics. However, many fans today consider Steeltown to be the band&#x27;s finest work.

James Dean Bradfield from Manic Street Preachers has cited the album as being one of his all-time favourites.

<text>John Hartson (born 5 April 1975) is a Welsh former professional footballer, coach and sports television pundit for S4C, Sky Sports, Premier Sports TV and TNT Sports.

As a player he was a striker, notably for Scottish club Celtic where his time with the Hoops saw three Scottish Premier League titles. Hartson also played in the Premier League with Arsenal, West Ham United, Wimbledon, Coventry City and West Bromwich Albion, and in the Football League for Luton Town and Norwich City.

Hartson earned 51 international caps for Wales, scoring 14 goals. He later held the position of head coach for Wales&#x27;s strikers.

==Early life==
John Hartson was born on 5 April 1975 in Swansea, the third of four children to Cyril and Diana Hartson. Cyril had played football for local team Afan Lido. 
His paternal grandfather, Pius Hartson (1918–2012), was from Newfoundland and served with the Royal Navy during World War II. Hartson grew up in Talycoppa, Swansea, alongside his elder brother James, elder sister Hayley and younger sister Victoria. As a youngster Hartson represented Lonlas Boys&#x27; Club in Skewen, playing his first match aged six. He joined Luton Town&#x27;s Youth Training Scheme at the age of sixteen but was suspended four months later for stealing a bank card from the son of a couple with whom he was lodging. He used the card to withdraw £50 in order to fund his gambling addiction. Hartson was suspended and sent home to Swansea but was reinstated by Luton shortly afterwards and allowed to resume his apprenticeship.

==Club career==

===Luton Town and Arsenal===
Hartson turned professional in 1992 and made his Luton Town first team debut as a substitute in a 1–0 League Cup defeat to Cambridge United on 24 August 1993. In January 1995, at 19, he joined Arsenal for £2.5 million, a British record fee for a teenage player at the time.
Along with Chris Kiwomya, Hartson was one of George Graham&#x27;s last signings before the manager&#x27;s sacking in February 1995. He made his Arsenal debut on 14 January 1995, a 1–1 home draw with Everton, and scored his first goal for the club the following week, the only goal in a 1–0 away win at Coventry City. He was a regular for the remainder of his first season, a highlight of which was scoring Arsenal&#x27;s 75th-minute equaliser in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final against Real Zaragoza; however a last-minute goal from 40 yards by Nayim over David Seaman meant Arsenal lost the game 2–1. He was strike-partner to Ian Wright, being favoured ahead of Kevin Campbell to fill the gap left by the injured Alan Smith, who retired at the end of the season.

Following the signing of Dennis Bergkamp, who was preferred up front to partner Wright, Hartson went on to feature under Graham&#x27;s successors Bruce Rioch and Arsène Wenger. With Wenger wanting him to stay at the
club, Hartson though in February 1997 linked up with West Ham United in a £3.2 million deal. At the time, he was the most expensive player to be signed by West Ham. The deal was initially reported to be worth £5 million.

In total, Hartson played 53 times for Arsenal, scoring 14 goals.

===West Ham United===
Hartson made his debut for West Ham on 15 February 1997 alongside another new signing, Paul Kitson. West Ham lost 1–0 to Derby County and Hartson was booked. His first West Ham goal came in his next following game on 24 February 1997, a 4–3 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. In his first season, he scored five league goals from eleven games and was instrumental in helping West Ham rise from 18th when he joined to a final league position for 1996–97 season of 14th. The next season saw Hartson finish, with 24 goals in 42 games in all competitions, as West Ham&#x27;s top scorer. Hartson&#x27;s goal tally was in all a considerable margin ahead of the next highest scorer, Eyal Berkovic with nine goals. In the 1998 close season, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards and assistant manager Brian Kidd expressed their desire for Hartson to sign for Manchester United to manager Alex Ferguson. However, Ferguson decided against making a bid for Hartson. In a training ground incident in September 1998, Hartson kicked West Ham teammate Eyal Berkovic in the face, after the Israeli midfielder had punched Hartson in the leg as he attempted to help Berkovic to his feet. The incident was captured on camera. Hartson was fined and admitted in his biography that it was an error of judgement. Berkovic said of the incident &quot;If my head had been a ball, it would have been in the top corner of the net&quot;.

His form suffered and he managed only four goals from twenty games in season 1998–99. His final game on 13 January 1999, saw West Ham lose 1–0 in an FA Cup tie against his hometown club, Swansea City.

Hartson played 73 times and scored 33 goals for the east London club.

===Wimbledon===
Hartson joined Wimbledon in January 1999, becoming the club&#x27;s most expensive signing ever at £7.5m. His time with the Dons was marred by injury, though he still managed a respectable goal tally, first in the Premier League, then the First Division following the club&#x27;s relegation in 2000. Proposed moves to Rangers, Tottenham and Charlton fell through due to doubts over the player&#x27;s fitness. Hartson instead joined Coventry City on a pay-for-play deal in February 2001.

===Coventry City===
Hartson made his Coventry debut against former club West Ham on 12 February 2001. He went on to score six goals in twelve league games, including a brace in a defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford. However, despite his efforts Coventry were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.

===Celtic===

In August 2001, Hartson joined Celtic in a £6m transfer. He made his debut on 4 August 2001, coming on as a substitute in a league match away at Kilmarnock. He scored his first goals for Celtic when he scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win over Dundee United on 20 October 2001. At the end of his first season at Celtic he helped them win the Scottish Premier League title.

In December 2002, Hartson scored as Celtic were beaten 2–1 in the away leg of their third round UEFA Cup tie against Celta Vigo. However, with the aggregate score 2–2, Celtic progressed on the away goals rule. This was the first time that Celtic had remained in European competition after Christmas since 1980. In March 2003, Celtic faced Liverpool in the UEFA Cup at the quarter final stage, drawing 1–1 in Glasgow.
In the return leg at Anfield, Hartson fired the club&#x27;s goal of the season with a strike past Jerzy Dudek into the top corner from over 25 yards out. Celtic won this match 2–0, progressing to the semi-final. After scoring the winning goal against Rangers at Ibrox in late April Hartson was plagued by a back injury which meant he missed the rest of the season, including the 2003 UEFA Cup Final. Nevertheless, he had played a major role in getting Celtic all the way through the tournament, with his goals in Liverpool and Vigo, as well as several assists. Celtic were defeated 3–2 in the final after extra time by José Mourinho&#x27;s FC Porto.

In March 2004, he dropped out for the remainder of the football season for surgery to his back; however, he recovered in time for Wales&#x27; unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup. Celtic went on to win the 2003–04 Scottish Cup and the 2003-04 title in his absence.

In April 2005 he shared the Scottish PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award with Fernando Ricksen and in May he was voted the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Player of the Year. He played as Celtic won the 2005 Scottish Cup Final.

On 6 November 2005 Hartson scored his 100th goal for Celtic against Falkirk. He missed Celtic&#x27;s victory in the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final through suspension. He scored the only goal against Hearts, on 5 April 2006, his 31st birthday to clinch the title for Celtic.

Hartson was sent off on a number of occasions, one being a notable dismissal towards the end of an Old Firm derby, when he was sent off for violent conduct along with Celtic teammate Johan Mjällby and Rangers player Fernando Ricksen. Hartson&#x27;s dismissal was overturned on appeal.

Due to the close bond Hartson felt with both Celtic Football Club and their fans, he has a tattoo of a large Celtic crest on his upper arm with the words &#x27;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&#x27; underneath in honour of the song which Celtic fans sing ahead of big games. After a picture of the tattoo appeared on the internet and many Celtic F.C. forums, Hartson tweeted that the tattoo was real and in honour of the support he had received from Celtic fans during his illness. The tweet read, &quot;Yes my Celtic tattoo is real I had it done soon as I came out of hospital after the support I was given by the whole Celtic family.&quot;

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 26 June 2006, Hartson signed a two-year contract with English Football League Championship side West Bromwich Albion in a £500,000 move. Hartson scored twice on his Albion debut in a 2–0 Hawthorns win against Hull City on 5 August 2006.

On 31 August 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; said that Hartson had signed for League One club Nottingham Forest on a loan move. On 5 September 2007, the &quot;Western Mail&quot; reported that Hartson had rejected a firm approach from Forest and was on the verge of signing for his hometown club Swansea City on loan. However the club quickly issued a statement on its website denying the striker was set to sign.

In October 2007 Hartson joined Norwich City on a month&#x27;s loan. Although Norwich had the option to extend the loan until 31 December, newly appointed manager Glenn Roeder decided to send Hartson back to the Midlands after the initial month period. He then rejected an offer to join Chester City on loan. In January 2008 Hartson was released by West Bromwich Albion, six months before the end of his contract.

On 7 February 2008, Hartson announced his retirement from football, citing his long-term struggles with weight and fitness as major reasons for finishing his career.

==International career==
Hartson won 51 first team caps for Wales, scoring 14 goals. He is currently the 11th highest scorer of all time for the Welsh.

He also holds a record for the Wales U21 team by being one of only four people to have scored a hat-trick at that level alongside Craig Davies, Lee Jones and Ched Evans.

Hartson retired from international football in February 2006 in order to concentrate on his career with Celtic but in August that year he stated that he would come out of retirement to play if John Toshack needed him.

==Media career==
Just a few weeks after his retirement from playing, East Stirlingshire in the Scottish Football League Third Division offered Hartson the chance to succeed Gordon Wylde as manager, but Hartson rejected the opportunity, saying that, &quot;the timing is just not right for me at the moment.&quot; Hartson joined Setanta Sports as a pundit for the 2008–09 season, as part of the broadcaster&#x27;s coverage of the Scottish Premier League. A Welsh speaker, Hartson appears regularly as a studio guest on S4C&#x27;s &quot;Sgorio&quot;. He was also a regular pundit on ITV&#x27;s coverage of the FA Cup until ITV lost the rights to the competition at the end of the 2013/14 season, and often appears on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s coverage of both Premier League and Champions League games as a match summariser. In 2011 Hartson was appointed part-time coach with Newport County. In 2016, he joined BT Sport to provide analysis on the newly launched BT Sport Score.
John also appeared in the Welsh language travel interest program Am Dro (Going for a Walk) broadcast on 1 January 2024

==Personal life==
In July 2009 Hartson received chemotherapy after being diagnosed with testicular cancer which had spread to his brain. It was later reported the cancer had spread to his lungs and that he remained in a &quot;critical condition&quot; following emergency surgery. The treatment was successful and by December of that year it was reported that the cancer had been virtually eradicated from Hartson&#x27;s body although he would have more surgery and treatment to come. Hartson is a lifelong Swansea City supporter.

In February 2024, Hartson was probed by the Advertising Standards Authority for misconduct while promoting and advertising Supreme CBD, owned by ex-boxer Anthony Fowler. Fowler along with other celebrities including Paul Merson, Matt Le Tissier and John Hartson have all been investigated and issued with a warning by the ASA. The ASA investigation concluded that their social media posts have been found to be commercial in nature, and not &quot;honest&quot; opinions about the benefits of CBD, since they were being financially rewarded for their posts. The investigation also concluded that the posts made by these celebrities were making unlawful medical claims about the use of CBD, which is prohibited by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

<text>Brier Island is an island in the Bay of Fundy in Digby County, Nova Scotia.

==Geography==
The island is the westernmost part of Nova Scotia and the southern end of the North Mountain ridge with Long Island lying immediately northeast; both islands constitute part of the Digby Neck. Brier Island measures approximately long and wide and is made up of basalt.
The island&#x27;s shoreline measures approximately in length. Brier Island is separated from Long Island by the Grand Passage. Westport is the only village on the island. The population, as of 2016 was 218. There were 98 private dwellings occupied year round.

The island is an important stopover point for migrating sea birds.

The island&#x27;s name is believed by some to come from the wild brier roses found there, another possibility is that the original name of the Island was &quot;Bryer&#x27;s&quot; after a sea captain from New England who was one of the first settlers to spend any time on the island. 

Another idea is that the name came from Andreas/Andrew Bayerlein whose name was changed to Brier and lived there around 1800. Andreas arrived in America in 1779 a Hessian Soldier from Ansbach, Bayern, Germany to fight in the Revolutionary War. He arrived 1783 in Nova Scotia and married Deborah Horton born Oct 22, 1775 daughter of Levi Horton and Mercy Haskell on December 16, 1794. Baptisms recorded at Church of England in Canada Trinity Anglican Church, Digby all on Nov 23, 1801 included an adult Deborah Brier, an adult Edmund Brier and 3 children of Andrew: Susanna Brier, Andrew Brier and William Brier.
(Nova Scotia Church Records 1720-2001 Church of England in Canada Trinity Church, Digby, Cumberland - Baptisms, marriages, burials 1786-1839)

==Economy==
The local economy is driven by the year-round commercial fishing industry and the seasonal tourism industry, which is largely focused on whale watching tours.

The island is home to R. E. Robicheau Ltd, a general store with a gas pump, gift shop, and café. On the eastern side of the island is the one hotel, the Brier Island Lodge. There are also several bed and breakfasts, a used book store and gift shops.
The island contains the fishing village of Westport which is connected to Freeport on Long Island by a ferry operated by the provincial government.
Brier Island is frequently inundated by fog and has witnessed 57 recorded shipwrecks. The island has &quot;a lighthouse per mile&quot; with the Northern and Western lighthouses on the island, as well as the Peter Island lighthouse in Grand Passage; all are automated and are operated by the Canadian Coast Guard. The wreck of the barque &quot;Aurora&quot; in 1908 provided the lumber for the Westport Community Hall.

The Canadian Coast Guard operates CCG Station Westport in the village. The rescue cutter CCGC &quot;Westport&quot; provides 24-hour-per-day, 7 days per week response to search and rescue incidents within the eastern Gulf of Maine and the southern and eastern Bay of Fundy.

<text>The Santa Rita Mountains (O&#x27;odham: To:wa Kuswo Doʼag), located about southeast of Tucson, Arizona, extend from north to south, then trending southeast. They merge again southeastwards into the Patagonia Mountains, trending northwest by southeast. The highest point in the range, and the highest point in the Tucson area, is Mount Wrightson, with an elevation of , The range contains Madera Canyon, one of the world&#x27;s premier birding areas. The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory is located on Mount Hopkins. The range is one of the Madrean sky islands.

The Santa Rita Mountains are mostly within the Coronado National Forest. Prior to 1908 they were the principal component of Santa Rita National Forest, which was combined with other small forest tracts to form Coronado. Much of the range lies within the Mt. Wrightson Wilderness, managed by the Coronado National Forest. The Santa Rita Mountains were severely burned in July 2005 in the Florida Fire.

On the western side of the northern Santa Rita Mountains, a large cliff face of white marble is visible from the Green Valley and Sahuarita areas. This &quot;white scar&quot; reminded early Spanish missionaries of Saint Rita of Cascia (1381–1457), an Italian nun, who is often depicted with a small wound on her forehead. The mountain range was consequently named after her.

Other mountain ranges surrounding the Tucson valley include the Santa Catalina Mountains, the Rincon Mountains, the Tucson Mountains, and the Tortolita Mountains.

==Rosemont mine==
A large porphyry copper deposit has been identified near the old Helvetia mining district on the north flank of the range. The proposed Rosemont Copper mine would be an open pit operation located in the Santa Ritas about west of mile marker 44 on Arizona State Route 83.

==Jaguars==
The Santa Rita Mountains were the temporary home range of &quot;El Jefe,&quot; an adult male jaguar first identified in 2011. He has not been seen since 2015 and it is presumed that he returned to Mexico, where the nearest breeding population of jaguars is located.

<doc id="1062947" wikidata="Q15120881" url="?curid=1062947" title="Loompanics">
<text>Loompanics Unlimited was an American book seller and publisher specializing in nonfiction on generally unconventional or controversial topics. The topics in their title list included drugs, weapons, survivalism, anarchism, sex, conspiracy theories, and so on. Many of their titles describe some kind of illicit or extralegal actions, such as &quot;Counterfeit I.D. Made Easy&quot; and &quot;Opium for the Masses&quot;, while others are purely informative, such as &quot;Uninhabited Ocean Islands&quot;, &quot;How to Buy Land Cheap&quot; and &quot;The Muckraker&#x27;s Manual&quot; (recommended by Stewart Brand).

==Company history==
Loompanics was in business for nearly 30 years. Its publisher and editor was Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Hoy who started Loompanics Unlimited in East Lansing, Michigan, in 1975. In 1982 he moved the business to Port Townsend, Washington, where his friend and fellow publisher R. W. Bradford had earlier relocated.

In January 2006, Loompanics announced that it was going out of business, and that it was selling off its inventory. In the spring of 2006, Paladin Press announced that it acquired the rights to 40 titles previously published or sold by Loompanics, including the works of Claire Wolfe, Eddie the Wire, and other popular Loompanics authors.

== Market position ==

In addition to Loompanics&#x27; large annual catalog of all its stock, Loompanics regularly mailed its customers a thinner quarterly supplement featuring a selection of books interspersed with articles about government propaganda and conspiracies, and/or underground resistance. The addressing side of the cover included a World War II American graphic of an eagle carrying a stack of volumes and the slogan, &quot;Our men want books!&quot;

Loompanics did not fall into the categories of mainstream liberal, conservative, or libertarian politics. While Michael Hoy expresses a preference for free markets, he also criticizes libertarians for championing multinational corporations, which he describes in a 2005 article as being entirely different entities from individuals. Hoy characterizes them as governmental entities, since their limited liability is the result of government fiat, rather than contractual dealings among individuals. Thus, in some ways, Hoy argues, corporations have more rights than individuals. He also criticized libertarians for brainwashing themselves, stating:

Hoy&#x27;s articles, which systemically lambasted the policies of all major political groups, earned him the wrath of organizations across the political spectrum.

Loompanics&#x27; FAQ stated that the company&#x27;s name is a play on words inspired by Hoy&#x27;s fondness for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

== Advertising rejections ==

According to Gia Cosindas, Amazon.com, eBay, and Google refused to allow Loompanics to advertise on their sites, since some of the books&#x27; content violates their editorial guidelines. Specifically, Google wrote, &quot;At this time, Google policy does not permit the advertisement of websites that contain &#x27;the promotion of violence [and] drugs or drug paraphernalia.&#x27;&quot;

== Legacy and aftermath ==
On May 8, 2006, Loompanics stopped accepting retail orders. Their website encouraged potential customers to contact other publishers, who have had several Loompanics titles transferred to them, or became the new publishers of established Loompanics authors.

Last Earth Distro, Last Word Books &amp; Press, AK Press, Earthlight Books, Eden Press, FS Books, Laissez Faire Books, Lehman&#x27;s, New Falcon Publications, Privacy Alert Online, Ronin Press, Steve Arnold&#x27;s Gun Room and Uncle Fester&#x27;s Books acquired most of Loompanics&#x27; back stock. Some titles have been reprinted by Paladin Press and Delta Press.

<doc id="1062951" wikidata="Q1373876" url="?curid=1062951" title="Nintendo Space World">
<text>formerly named and was an annual video game trade show hosted by Nintendo from 1989 to 2001. Its three days of high-energy party atmosphere was the primary venue for Nintendo and its licensees to announce and demonstrate new consoles, accessories, and games. Anticipated and dissected each year with hype and exclusivity, it was a destination for the international video game press, with detailed developer interviews and technology demos.

The show was the launch or marketing flashpoints of countless products, especially Nintendo&#x27;s flagship platforms and video games. The show launched the Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, 64DD, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and all the ongoing games in the &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchises. Some major exhibits were teased and then never seen again, leaving fans and press to maintain hype and inquiry for years, as with the &quot;Super Mario 128&quot; demo spectacle, the controversial art style of the &quot;Wind Waker&quot; teaser video, &quot;Mother 3&quot; (&quot;EarthBound 64&quot;), and a litany of lost 64DD games.

==Format==
The three day format began with one day called &quot;Shoshinkai&quot; (lit. &quot;beginning party&quot;) exclusively for press attendance, and two days called Space World for open public attendance. Nintendo officially referred to the whole event as &quot;Shoshinkai&quot; for some years until 1996, and then as &quot;Space World&quot; since 1997. The show floor had many third party booths surrounding Nintendo&#x27;s large main booths, all with videos and many playable prerelease games, and some with outlandish decor and character performances. Unlike most other video game trade events, only Nintendo decided whether and when to hold each annual show. It was in Japan, either in Kyoto which also hosts Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters, or at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Chiba. After the most recent Space World show in 2001, the company instead began to favor online publishing and industry-wide conferences such as E3.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; explains: &quot;Q: What is Famicom Space World? A: Space World is a free show for the public that follows the one-day Shoshinkai. Gamers who wish to attend need only pick up an entry pass at any official Nintendo retail location in Japan.&quot;

==History==
===Shoshinkai 1989===
The first Shoshinkai show was held on July 28, 1989. The Super Famicom was announced and &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was reportedly shown.

===Shoshinkai 1990===
The second Shoshinkai show was held on August 28–29, 1990. The final version of the Super Famicom was unveiled to the public. Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy games were on display in areas that Nintendo called &quot;Symbolic Zones&quot;.

===Shoshinkai 1991===
The third Shoshinkai show was held on April 24 to May 6, 1991. The Super Famicom had been on the market for a few months and much attention was given to its games including &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;.

===Shoshinkai 1992===
The fourth Shoshinkai show was held on August 26, 1992. The Super FX chip was announced.

===Shoshinkai 1993===
The fifth Shoshinkai show was held on August 25, 1993. On August 25, President of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, announced Project Reality, a major strategic partnership with Silicon Graphics for the development of what would become the Nintendo 64.

===Shoshinkai 1994===
The sixth Shoshinkai show was held on November 15–16, 1994. Project Reality had already been renamed Ultra 64.

Hiroshi Yamauchi introduced the portable Virtual Boy console, along with its hardware specifications, launch games, and future games. The startup screen of the prototype was shown. A &quot;very confident&quot; projection of &quot;sales in Japan of 3 million hardware units and 14 million software units by March 1996&quot; was given to the press. The demo of what would have been a &quot;Star Fox&quot; game showed an Arwing doing various spins and motions.

Gamers who previewed the system complained that the &quot;Mario&quot; demo was not realistic enough, was not in full color, and did not motion-track the image when players turn their heads. In the lead editorial of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; following the show, Ed Semrad predicted that the Virtual Boy would have poor launch sales due to the monochrome screen, lack of true portability, unimpressive lineup of games seen at Shoshinkai, and the price, which he argued was as low as it could get given the hardware but still too expensive for the experience the system offered. &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s editors were also dubious of the Virtual Boy&#x27;s prospects when they left the show, and concluded their article on the system by commenting, &quot;But who will buy it? It&#x27;s not portable, it&#x27;s awkward to use, it&#x27;s 100% antisocial (unlike multiplayer SNES/Genesis games), it&#x27;s too expensive and – most importantly – the &#x27;VR&#x27; (i.e. 3D effect) doesn&#x27;t add to the game at all: it&#x27;s just a novelty.&quot;

===Shoshinkai 1995===
The seventh Shoshinkai show was held on November 22–24, 1995, at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Chiba, Japan. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; described the scene where &quot;hordes of Japanese schoolkids huddled in the cold outside an exhibition hall in a small town near Tokyo, the electricity of anticipation clearly rippling through their ranks&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; interviewed Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka about the development of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Zelda&quot;, and game philosophy.

The show featured the public unveiling of the newly renamed Nintendo 64 console, with thirteen games. This included the playable prototypes of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Kirby Ball 64&quot;, and a videotape containing a total of three minutes of very early footage of eleven other Nintendo 64 games. Of all these, the development of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was reportedly the most advanced, though only 50 percent complete. Twelve playable demos had been prepared for the show, but Hiroshi Yamauchi removed ten of them from the itinerary just days beforehand. &quot;Zelda 64&quot; was shown in the form of an abstract technical and thematic demonstration video, where &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine said &quot;Well, the fact is that the videotape sequences shown at Shoshinkai bear very little resemblance to what the final product will actually look like. Spectacular scenes of a surprisingly large Link clad in polished armor are most likely to end up in cut-scenes rather than representing the actual play.&quot; Some brief early footage of &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; was shown on November 24, which Miyamoto said was 95% complete, but which was not shown in playable form due to the difficult logistics of demonstrating the multiplayer features. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reported overall.

Nintendo made its first announcement of the 64DD peripheral, saying it would be launched by the end of 1996, though releasing virtually no technical specifications. New and upcoming role-playing games for the Super Famicom, Virtual Boy, and Game Boy were exhibited, including &quot;Pokémon Red and Green&quot;.

===Shoshinkai 1996===

The eighth Shoshinkai show was held on November 22–24, 1996 at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Chiba, Japan. New software was shown for the Nintendo 64, Super NES, and Game Boy. Nintendo of America&#x27;s website published a report of the show including photos and videos, the roster of Nintendo 64 games and some demo reviews, and a translated summary (from &quot;Famimaga 64&quot; issue 12) of a panel discussion among key personnel about their philosophy of Nintendo 64 game development.

This show bore the first demonstration of the 64DD. IGN reported that this was one of the biggest items of the show along with first-party games, but other gaming press said 64DD was kept out of the spotlight and had no meaningful demonstration of capabilities. Nintendo stated that it was deliberately downplaying the 64DD at the show in order to demonstrate the ongoing commitment to the cartridge format. Nintendo&#x27;s Director of Corporate Communications, Perrin Kaplan, made the company&#x27;s first official launch window announcement for 64DD, scheduled for late 1997 in Japan. The 64DD system was shown in its own display booth with the hardware specifications having been finalized, according to Nintendo of America&#x27;s Chairman Howard Lincoln. &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; ran on 64DD, which was an improvised conversion from the new retail cartridge release onto floppy disk to demonstrate the bootable prototype floppy drive, only at this show. Lincoln explained, &quot;&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is running on the 64DD right now. First they weren&#x27;t going to show anything on 64DD, but they decided at the last minute to have a game people recognize.&quot; The booth also demonstrated the process of rendering audience members&#x27; photographed faces onto 3D avatars and shapes—a feature which was ultimately incorporated and released in 2000 as &quot;Mario Artist: Talent Studio&quot; and the Capture Cassette for 64DD. Another 64DD game in development was &quot;Creator&quot;, a music and animation game by Software Creations, the same UK company that had made &quot;Sound Tool&quot; for the Nintendo Ultra 64 development kit. They touted the game&#x27;s ability to be integrated into other games, allowing a player to replace any such game&#x27;s textures and possibly create new levels and characters. There was no playable version of &quot;Creator&quot; available at this show, but the project was later absorbed into &quot;Mario Artist: Paint Studio&quot; (1999).

Reportedly several developers attended the show to learn how to develop for 64DD, some having traveled from the US for the 64DD presentation and some having received 64DD development kits. Included in the early roster of committed 64DD developers, Rare officially discounted any rumors of the peripheral&#x27;s impending pre-release cancellation.

N64.com described the presentation of &quot;Zelda 64&quot; as &quot;very quick shots on videotape&quot;. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island 64&quot; debuted in a short video, and was eventually released as &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;. &quot;The biggest surprise&quot; of the show according to IGN and &quot;most impressive [new peripheral]&quot; according to &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; was the Jolting Pak, which was eventually launched as the Rumble Pak in a bundle with the upcoming &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; derisively claimed it &quot;was seen as merely another whimsical Nintendo fancy destined to the bin marked Good Idea at the Time&quot;.

Miyamoto was interviewed, including about 64DD and Jolting Pak.

The highly anticipated &quot;EarthBound 64&quot; debuted as a video trailer segment within the overall video loop of gameplay footage. Copies of this footage were hunted and analyzed for decades as part of &quot;EarthBound&quot; fandom and lore.

===Space World 1997===
The ninth show was renamed to Space World, held on November 21–24, 1997. Some media of the event was streamed live on Nintendo&#x27;s website. The event was heavily focused on the Japan market and on peripheral hardware, with several 64DD demonstrations and the unveiling of the Game Boy Camera, Game Boy Printer, Transfer Pak, Nintendo 64 Mouse, and Voice Recognition Unit. The event featured an early prototype of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, with two starting Pokémon which do not appear in the final game, and an early Chikorita. The game was not completed until 1999, largely changed. The ROM image for this demo was anonymously dumped and released online on May 31, 2018. Other featured games include &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, &quot;Pikachu Genki Dechu&quot; (&quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot;), and &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine relayed Chairman Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s speech that Nintendo 64 adoption in Japan was unexpectedly unfavorable, due to general declination of home console games as often &quot;boring or complicated&quot; and unappealing to ordinary users, and lionizing the mobile &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; as the exemplar to learn from. Nintendo again delayed the 64DD launch; the magazine staff discerned (and witnessed of American visitors) no appeal toward the US market from any current 64DD software (mostly &quot;Mario Artist&quot; and &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;), and said &quot;64DD&#x27;s future does not look good&quot;. Nintendo instead mainly promoted &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; as the best selling game of 1997 and of all time on Game Boy. The magazine said &quot;Miyamoto&#x27;s brace of games on display all lived up to expectations&quot; with &quot;Zelda 64&quot; as &quot;the focal point on the show floor&quot;, with a small game world playable demonstration, and reported seeing a general consensus that &quot;it&#x27;s even better than &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;&quot;. Nintendo demonstrated &quot;F-Zero X&quot; and the surprise game &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot;. Miyamoto interviewed about the secret prototype of &quot;Cabbage&quot; for 64DD and Game Boy.

The magazine said &quot;third-party software, however, mostly continues to suck&quot; with no evidence of Nintendo improving third-party developer relations. San Mehat of Argonaut Games attributed this to a lack of Nintendo&#x27;s development systems, lack of publishers, lack of cartridge data capacity, and big competition from Nintendo. George Harrison, the Vice President of Nintendo of America, candidly explained that the show&#x27;s third party developers were often lackluster because of the unexpected difficulty inherent to the industry&#x27;s transition from 2D to 3D game development where even some members of the heavily supported Dream Team had struggled with Project Reality, procurement costs of the Nintendo 64 Game Pak, Nintendo&#x27;s lack of developer support, and the inherent difficulty in competing with Nintendo.

===Space World 1999===
Having skipped 1998 because of a lack of 64DD launch games to show, the tenth show was held on August 27–29, 1999. IGN explained that the 64DD&#x27;s notoriously repeated launch delays were so significant, and the company&#x27;s software library was so dependent upon the 64DD&#x27;s launch, that this directly caused the skipping of Space World in 1998. The event had been delayed from 1998 to early 1999 and had been expected to slip again to November 1999.

The show was held at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Tokyo&#x27;s Chiba prefecture. Long queues of 45-90 minutes were at each game demonstration kiosk. The Randnet dialup Internet service had recently been announced as currently in testing in Japan, to accompany the upcoming 64DD launch.

Many games for Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color were announced and demonstrated, and &quot;Core Magazine&quot; said the Game Boy Color lineup reportedly attracted even more visitor traffic than the 64DD booth. Nintendo 64 Game Paks included &quot;Zelda Gaiden&quot; (later renamed &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;), &quot;Paper Mario&quot;, &quot;Mother 3&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Gold and Silver&quot;. Nintendo&#x27;s 64DD booth demonstrated eight launch games intended for later that year: &quot;Gendai Dai-Senryaku: Ultimate War&quot;, &quot;Kyojin no Doshin 1&quot; (&quot;Doshin the Giant&quot;), &quot;F-Zero X Expansion Kit&quot;, &quot;Japanese Professional Golf&quot;, &quot;Mahjong School&quot;, &quot;SimCity&quot;, &quot;Talent Studio&quot;, and &quot;Paint Studio&quot;. IGN said that &quot;Ultimate War&quot; was one of the best games of the show, including &quot;competitive network gaming via the Randnet service&quot;. &quot;Doshin the Giant&quot;″s developer Kazutoshi Iida recalled a &quot;continuous line of people queued to use the eight playable test units, and the &#x27;Large Screen Experience&#x27;&quot; with a very enthusiastic foreign press. A &quot;captivated&quot; audience of young children returned on each of the event&#x27;s three days just to play &quot;Doshin&quot;. &quot;Mother 3&quot; (&quot;EarthBound 64&quot;) was demonstrated for the first time, and the sudden announcement that it had been converted from 64DD disk to cartridge plus expansion disk was taken by IGN as bad news for the 64DD platform, having been seen as a crucial launch game for it. The half-complete &quot;Mother 3&quot; was the favorite of &quot;Core Magazine&quot; staff, and the only demo with headphones, though with one basic story element. Nintendo&#x27;s 64DD booth&#x27;s display cases included the debut of a data transfer (DT) cable from Game Boy Color to 64DD with a prototype of the card trading game &quot;DT Bloodmasters&quot;. Many more 64DD games were reported in development. &quot;64 Wars&quot;, also known as &quot;Advance Wars 64&quot;, was noninteractively demonstrated.

A detailed stage play was themed for &quot;Pokémon&quot;, with lively actors dressed in large, fuzzy costumes. &quot;Pokémon&quot; audio CDs were given to the audience.

===Space World 2000===
The eleventh show was held on August 24–26, 2000. This hosted the dual-announcement of GameCube and Game Boy Advance, while maintaining Nintendo 64. In June, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gaming magazine in Japan had published a seemingly incomplete list of games expected to be covered at the show, for the Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and the upcoming Game Boy Advance. Nintendo&#x27;s GBA announcement included peripherals such as the Link cable, the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable, a rechargeable battery pack, and an infrared communications adaptor which would allow systems to exchange data.

IGN joked that the 64DD was &quot;DeaDD&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; said, &quot;the gaming press had already witnessed [early pre-launch demonstrations of] the stunning graphics of 128-bit videogame systems like Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast, Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox [so] when you&#x27;re late to the party, you&#x27;d better be dressed to kill.&quot;
The show floor had an audience of 2,000, mostly male. Entertainment included &quot;heavy artillery-loud techno music, smoke machines, and women in latex skirts&quot;. There was a huge screen at Nintendo&#x27;s event stage, with two hours of next-generation presentation videos. A compilation trailer of Nintendo licenses running on GameCube hardware was displayed, including &quot;Derby Stallion&quot;, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and &quot;Meowth&#x27;s Party&quot;. Nintendo conducted the now legendary interactive technology demonstration called &quot;Super Mario 128&quot; and played the brief video clip of &quot;The Legend of Zelda 128&quot;. Created with a realistic and gritty look to demonstrate the GameCube&#x27;s power, the clip resonated with fans and commentators who hoped it previewed the next &quot;Zelda&quot; game. &quot;Newsweek&quot; said &quot;There were 128 Marios bouncing around on an endlessly shifting landscape; a nightclub filled with rambunctious Pokémon; a &quot;Star Wars&quot; X-wing fighter leading a blazing assault on the Death Starall so vividly rendered that they could have been stolen from a Pixar movie. And judging from the raucous response, the standing-room only crowd clearly felt that GameCube was well worth the wait.&quot;

The following two days included hands-on demonstrations of games such as &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;, &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot;, and &quot;Animal Forest&quot; for Nintendo 64, and &quot;Mario Kart Advance&quot; for GBA.

&quot;EarthBound 64&quot; was one of the most anticipated games for the show, but had been canceled in an announcement just a few days prior on August 20, 2000. In early 2000, Miyamoto had declared hope of a debut demonstration of the four year old secret &quot;Cabbage&quot; prototype at this show, which did not happen and was never mentioned again.

===Space World 2001===
The twelfth show was held on August 24–26, 2001 and was the last Space World consumer event. It featured the upcoming GameCube and recently released Game Boy Advance. A short clip of &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; was shown in its early form.

Following the previous year&#x27;s show, Nintendo presented a second demo clip of the upcoming &quot;Zelda&quot; game. Response to the radically different cel-shaded design was divided. Some attendees enjoyed the new look, but there was backlash from disappointed fans who had hoped for a more realistic &quot;Zelda&quot; like the previous year&#x27;s demo. Critics derisively dubbed the game &quot;Celda&quot;. Miyamoto was surprised at the response.

===Other events===
From 2003 to 2006, Nintendo held the annual Nintendo Fusion Tour, featuring the announcement of the company&#x27;s latest video games and a rock music venue.

Nintendo World 2006 showcased the Wii and Nintendo DS. Nintendo World 2011 was in Tokyo from January 8–10, 2011. At this exhibition, the company gave the specific details on the Japanese launch of the Nintendo 3DS.

The company has held many gameplay competition events such as Nintendo World Championships, Nintendo PowerFest &#x27;94, and Nintendo Campus Challenge. Nintendo has presented major releases and announcements by consistently participating with Electronic Entertainment Expo, and by creating its own online video event series Nintendo Direct.

==Legacy==
Some Shoshinkai and Space World events served as epicenters of some of the most intense anticipation within the video game industry of the late 1990s and the 2000s. At these shows, Nintendo launched the Super Famicom, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, 64DD, and all the core games at the time within the &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchises. Some events showed exclusive videos, playable previews, and live technology demos of vital video game material that would never be seen again, leaving fans and press to build hype and intrigue for years. Ever since, video game historians would mine remnants of papers, video clips, interviews, and software from the show&#x27;s corpus of media materials. This would be gleaned from trade press coverage at the time, revisited in celebrity developer interviews over the years, and from artifacts discovered in the world&#x27;s secondary markets over the decades.

In 2014, collectors discovered in a thrift shop in Japan the &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; floppy disk for 64DD from Shoshinkai 1996. The global community of video game historians analyzed the software&#x27;s cosmetic idiosyncrasies which had resulted from its disposable nature as a late improvised demonstration of the floppy drive prototype just for that one show.

&quot;EarthBound 64&quot; debuted at Shoshinkai 1996 with exclusive teaser videos and again as a demonstration in 1999. The game was only ever experienced by the public at this trade show, as one of the most anticipated and yet inexplicably unreleased games of Nintendo&#x27;s history. In 2019, collectors discovered more video clips from the 1996 show, to be analyzed and canonized by &quot;EarthBound&quot; fandom.

Space World 2000&#x27;s technology demonstration session launched what became the decade-long legend of &quot;Super Mario 128&quot;. It possessed the world&#x27;s intrigue and created some of the highest anticipation in gaming history, in part because its exclusivity to this one brief event made it so mysterious. Instead of becoming a real game, many pieces of its technology were sowed into various hit games such as &quot;Pikmin&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;.

<text>Gastrointestinal diseases (abbrev. GI diseases or GI illnesses) refer to diseases involving the gastrointestinal tract, namely the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine and rectum; and the accessory organs of digestion, the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

== Oral disease ==

The oral cavity is part of the gastrointestinal system and as such the presence of alterations in this district can be the first sign of both systemic and gastrointestinal diseases. By far the most common oral conditions are plaque-induced diseases (e.g., gingivitis, periodontitis, dental caries). Oral symptoms can be similar to lesions occurring elsewhere in the digestive tract, with a pattern of swelling, inflammation, ulcers, and fissures. If these signs are present, then patients are more likely to also have anal and esophageal lesions and experience other extra-intestinal disease manifestations. Some diseases which involve other parts of the GI tract can manifest in the mouth, alone or in combination, including:
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease can cause acid erosion of the teeth and halitosis.
* Gardner&#x27;s syndrome can be associated with failure of tooth eruption, supernumerary teeth, and dentigerous cysts.
* Peutz–Jeghers syndrome can cause dark spots on the oral mucosa or on the lips or the skin around the mouth.
* Several GI diseases, especially those associated with malabsorption, can cause recurrent mouth ulcers, atrophic glossitis, and angular cheilitis (e.g., Crohn&#x27;s disease is sometimes termed orofacial granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone).
* Sideropenic dysphagia can cause glossitis, angular cheilitis.

==Oesophageal disease==
Oesophageal diseases include a spectrum of disorders affecting the oesophagus. The most common condition of the oesophagus in Western countries is gastroesophageal reflux disease, which in chronic forms is thought to result in changes to the epithelium of the oesophagus, known as Barrett&#x27;s oesophagus.

Acute disease might include infections such as oesophagitis, trauma caused by the ingestion of corrosive substances, or rupture of veins such as oesophageal varices, Boerhaave syndrome or Mallory-Weiss tears. Chronic diseases might include congenital diseases such as Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum and esophageal webbing, and oesophageal motility disorders including the nutcracker oesophagus, achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, and oesophageal stricture.

Oesophageal disease may result in a sore throat, throwing up blood, difficulty swallowing or vomiting. Chronic or congenital diseases might be investigated using barium swallows, endoscopy and biopsy, whereas acute diseases such as reflux may be investigated and diagnosed based on symptoms and a medical history alone.

==Gastric disease==

Gastric diseases refer to diseases affecting the stomach. Inflammation of the stomach by infection from any cause is called gastritis, and when including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract called gastroenteritis. When gastritis persists in a chronic state, it is associated with several diseases, including atrophic gastritis, pyloric stenosis, and gastric cancer. Another common condition is gastric ulceration, peptic ulcers. Ulceration erodes the gastric mucosa, which protects the tissue of the stomach from the stomach acids. Peptic ulcers are most commonly caused by a bacterial &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection. Epstein–Barr virus infection is another factor to induce gastric cancer.

As well as peptic ulcers, vomiting blood may result from abnormal arteries or veins that have ruptured, including Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion and Gastric antral vascular ectasia. Congenital disorders of the stomach include pernicious anaemia, in which a targeted immune response against parietal cells results in an inability to absorb vitamin B12. Other common symptoms that stomach disease might cause include indigestion or dyspepsia, vomiting, and in chronic disease, digestive problems leading to forms of malnutrition. In addition to routine tests, an endoscopy might be used to examine or take a biopsy from the stomach. 

==Intestinal disease==
The small and large intestines may be affected by infectious, autoimmune, and physiological states. Inflammation of the intestines is called enterocolitis, which may lead to diarrhea.

Acute conditions affecting the bowels include infectious diarrhea and mesenteric ischaemia. Causes of constipation may include faecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn be caused by ileus, intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

Diseases of the intestine may cause vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, and altered stool, such as with blood in stool. Colonoscopy may be used to examine the large intestine, and a person&#x27;s stool may be sent for culture and microscopy. Infectious disease may be treated with targeted antibiotics, and inflammatory bowel disease with immunosuppression. Surgery may also be used to treat some causes of bowel obstruction.

The normal thickness of the small intestinal wall is 3–5 mm, and 1–5 mm in the large intestine. Focal, irregular and asymmetrical gastrointestinal wall thickening on CT scan suggests a malignancy. Segmental or diffuse gastrointestinal wall thickening is most often due to ischemic, inflammatory or infectious disease. Though less common, medications such as ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema and small bowel thickening.

===Small intestine===
The small intestine consists of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Inflammation of the small intestine is called enteritis, which if localised to just part is called duodenitis, jejunitis and ileitis, respectively. Peptic ulcers are also common in the duodenum.

Chronic diseases of malabsorption may affect the small intestine, including the autoimmune coeliac disease, infective tropical sprue, and congenital or surgical short bowel syndrome. Other rarer diseases affecting the small intestine include Curling&#x27;s ulcer, blind loop syndrome, Milroy disease and Whipple&#x27;s disease. Tumours of the small intestine include gastrointestinal stromal tumours, lipomas, hamartomas and carcinoid syndromes.

Diseases of the small intestine may present with symptoms such as diarrhoea, malnutrition, fatigue and weight loss. Investigations pursued may include blood tests to monitor nutrition, such as iron levels, folate and calcium, endoscopy and biopsy of the duodenum, and barium swallow. Treatments may include renutrition and antibiotics for infections.

===Large intestine===

Diseases that affect the large intestine may affect it in whole or in part. Appendicitis is one such disease, caused by inflammation of the appendix. Generalised inflammation of the large intestine is referred to as colitis, which when caused by the bacteria &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; is referred to as pseudomembranous colitis. Diverticulitis is a common cause of abdominal pain resulting from outpouchings that particularly affect the colon. Functional colonic diseases refer to disorders without a known cause, including irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal pseudoobstruction. Constipation may result from lifestyle factors, impaction of a rigid stool in the rectum, or in neonates, Hirschprung&#x27;s disease.

Diseases affecting the large intestine may cause blood to be passed with stool, may cause constipation, or may result in abdominal pain or a fever. Tests that specifically examine the function of the large intestine include barium swallows, abdominal x-rays, and colonoscopy.

===Rectum and anus===
Diseases affecting the rectum and anus are extremely common, especially in older adults. Hemorrhoids, vascular outpouchings of skin, are very common, as is pruritus ani, referring to anal itchiness. Other conditions, such as anal cancer may be associated with ulcerative colitis or with sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. Inflammation of the rectum is known as proctitis, one cause of which is radiation damage associated with radiotherapy to other sites such as the prostate. Faecal incontinence can result from mechanical and neurological problems, and when associated with a lack of voluntary voiding ability is described as encopresis. Pain on passing stool may result from anal abscesses, small inflamed nodules, anal fissures, and anal fistulas.

Rectal and anal disease may be asymptomatic, or may present with pain when passing stools, fresh blood in stool, a feeling of incomplete emptying, or pencil-thin stools. In addition to regular tests, medical tests used to investigate the anus and rectum include the digital rectal exam and proctoscopy.

==Accessory digestive gland disease==

===Hepatic===

Hepatic diseases refers to those affecting the liver. Hepatitis refers to inflammation of liver tissue, and may be acute or chronic. Infectious viral hepatitis, such as hepatitis A, B and C, affect in excess of (X) million people worldwide. Liver disease may also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as fatty liver and NASH. Alcoholic liver disease may also develop as a result of chronic alcohol use, which may also cause alcoholic hepatitis. Cirrhosis may develop as a result of chronic hepatic fibrosis in a chronically inflamed liver, such as one affected by alcohol or viral hepatitis.

Liver abscesses are often acute conditions, with common causes being pyogenic and amoebic. Chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, may be a cause of liver failure, a state where the liver is unable to compensate for chronic damage, and unable to meet the metabolic demands of the body. In the acute setting, this may be a cause of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. Other causes of chronic liver disease are genetic or autoimmune disease, such as hemochromatosis, Wilson&#x27;s disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis.

Acute liver disease rarely results in pain, but may result in jaundice. Infectious liver disease may cause a fever. Chronic liver disease may result in a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, yellowing of the skin or eyes, easy bruising, immunosuppression, and feminization. Portal hypertension is often present, and this may lead to the development of prominent veins in many parts of the body, such as oesophageal varices, and haemorrhoids.

In order to investigate liver disease, a medical history, including regarding a person&#x27;s family history, travel to risk-prone areas, alcohol use and food consumption, may be taken. A medical examination may be conducted to investigate for symptoms of liver disease. Blood tests may be used, particularly liver function tests, and other blood tests may be used to investigate the presence of the Hepatitis viruses in the blood, and ultrasound used. If ascites is present, abdominal fluid may be tested for protein levels.

===Pancreatic===

Pancreatic diseases that affect digestion refers to disorders affecting the exocrine pancreas, which is a part of the pancreas involved in digestion.

One of the most common conditions of the exocrine pancreas is acute pancreatitis, which in the majority of cases relates to gallstones that have impacted in the pancreatic part of the biliary tree, or due to acute or chronic hazardous alcohol use or as a side-effect of ERCP. Other forms of pancreatitis include chronic and hereditary forms. Chronic pancreatitis may predispose to pancreatic cancer and is strongly linked to alcohol use. Other rarer diseases affecting the pancreas may include pancreatic pseudocysts, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and pancreatic fistulas.

Pancreatic disease may present with or without symptoms. When symptoms occur, such as in acute pancreatitis, a person may experience acute-onset, severe mid-abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, pancreatitis may lead to rapid blood loss and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. When the pancreas is unable to secrete digestive enzymes, such as with a pancreatic cancer occluding the pancreatic duct, result in jaundice. Pancreatic disease might be investigated using abdominal x-rays, MRCP or ERCP, CT scans, and through blood tests such as measurement of the amylase and lipase enzymes.

===Gallbladder and biliary tract===
Diseases of the hepatobiliary system affect the biliary tract (also known as the &quot;biliary tree&quot;), which secretes bile in order to aid digestion of fats. Diseases of the gallbladder and bile ducts are commonly diet-related, and may include the formation of gallstones that impact in the gallbladder (cholecystolithiasis) or in the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis).

Gallstones are a common cause of inflammation of the gallbladder, called cholecystitis. Inflammation of the biliary duct is called cholangitis, which may be associated with autoimmune disease, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, or a result of bacterial infection, such as ascending cholangitis.

Disease of the biliary tree may cause pain in the upper right abdomen, particularly when pressed. Disease might be investigated using ultrasound or ERCP, and might be treated with drugs such as antibiotics or UDCA, or by the surgical removal of the gallbladder.

===Cancer===

The Wikipedia article &quot;Gastrointestinal cancer&quot; describes the specific malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. In general, a significant factor in the etiology of gastrointestinal cancers appears to be excessive exposure of the digestive organs to bile acids.

<text>Gustaf Allan Pettersson (19 September 1911 – 20 June 1980) was a Swedish composer and violist. He is considered one of the 20th century&#x27;s most important Swedish composers and was described as one of the last great symphonists, often compared to Gustav Mahler. His music can hardly be confused with other 20th-century works. In the final decade of his life, his symphonies (typically one-movement works) developed an international following, particularly in Germany and Sweden. Of these, his best known work is Symphony No. 7. His music later found success in the United States. The conductors Antal Doráti and Sergiu Comissiona premiered and recorded several of his symphonies. Pettersson&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Barefoot Songs&quot; influenced many of his compositions. Doráti arranged eight of the &quot;Barefoot Songs&quot;. Birgit Cullberg produced three ballets based on Pettersson&#x27;s music.

Pettersson studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music&#x27;s conservatory. For more than a decade, he was a violist in the Stockholm Concert Society; after retiring he devoted himself exclusively to composition. Later in his life, he experienced rheumatoid arthritis. Pettersson was awarded the Swedish royal medal Litteris et Artibus.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on 19 September 1911, Gustaf Allan Pettersson was the youngest of four children. His father, Karl Viktor Pettersson (1875–1952), was a violent, alcoholic blacksmith, and his mother, Ida Paulina (née Svenson) (1876–1960), was a dressmaker. Pettersson was born at Granhammar manor in Västra Ryd parish in the Uppland province of Sweden. He grew up poor in Stockholm&#x27;s Södermalm district, where he lived during his whole life. He once said: 
With his parents and siblings, Pettersson lived in a damp, one-room basement apartment with bars on the window. When he was 10, he bought a cheap violin with money he earned from selling Christmas cards and taught himself to play it. Even the beatings he received from his father and the threat of reform school could not diminish his interest in music. Through strict self-discipline and with the help of music, Pettersson freed himself from his social misery and difficult family circumstances. Aged 14, he finished elementary school and took up full-time practice on the violin. He later made two unsuccessful attempts to enter the Royal Swedish Academy of Music&#x27;s conservatory.

In 1930, Pettersson began studying violin and later the viola, as well as counterpoint and harmony, at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music&#x27;s conservatory (Royal College of Music, Stockholm). At the beginning of World War II, he was in Paris, studying the viola with the French violist Maurice Vieux. Pettersson won the Jenny Lind scholarship prize in 1938, using it to study abroad.

===Later life===

During the 1940s, Pettersson worked as a violist in the Stockholm Concert Society (later the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra). He also studied composition with the composer and conductor Karl-Birger Blomdahl, orchestration with the conductor Tor Mann, and counterpoint with organist and composer Otto Olsson. In 1943, he married a physiotherapist, Gudrun Tyra Charlotta Gustafsson (1921–2017).

In September 1951, Pettersson went to Paris to study composition and was a student of composers René Leibowitz, Arthur Honegger, Olivier Messiaen, and Darius Milhaud. He returned to Sweden at the end of 1952. In the early 1950s, he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. He gave up playing the viola and began devoting his life to composition. In 1954, he received an annual state composition grant for his first time.

By the time of his Symphony No. 5, completed in 1962, his mobility and health were compromised considerably. In 1964, the government granted him a lifelong guaranteed income. His greatest success came a few years later with his (1966), which premiered on 13 October 1968 in Stockholm Concert Hall with Antal Doráti conducting the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. A recording of his seventh symphony, with the same conductor and orchestra, was released in 1969. It was a breakthrough, establishing his international reputation, and he received two Swedish Grammis in 1970. The conductors Antal Doráti and Sergiu Comissiona premiered and made first recordings of several of Pettersson&#x27;s symphonies and contributed to his rise to fame during the 1970s.

Pettersson was hospitalized for nine months in 1970, soon after the composition of his Symphony No. 9, his longest symphony. He began writing the condensed Symphony No. 10 (1972) from his sickbed. Pettersson was admitted to Karolinska Hospital, because of a life-threatening kidney ailment. He recovered, but rheumatoid arthritis confined him most of the time to his fourth-floor apartment in a building with no elevator. In 1975, after a dispute about a change in a concert program for an American tour, the Stockholm Philharmonic was forbidden to perform works by Pettersson &quot;for all time&quot;. The ban was lifted in 1976. Pettersson was awarded the Litteris et Artibus, a Swedish royal medal established in 1853, in 1977. In autumn 1978, he moved to a state living quarters. He began writing his seventeenth symphony, but died, at age 68, in Stockholm&#x27;s Maria Magdalena parish before finishing it. He is buried in the Högalid Church columbarium.

==Music==
Pettersson&#x27;s music can be compared to Mahler&#x27;s symphonic output, especially in the magnificent design and the passion and dynamism. The symphonic eccentric Pettersson is not an avant-gardist. His kinetic and organic development of musical matter uses traditional means of expression. Basic motifs are constantly being changed and developed. Pettersson&#x27;s writing is very strenuous and often has many simultaneous polyphonic lines. His symphonies &quot;end&quot; on common major or minor chords—but tonality, which depends on some sense, however attenuated, of tonal progression, is found mostly in slower sections. This can be shown at the openings and endings of his 6th and 7th symphonies, and the end of his 9th. Overwhelmingly serious in tone, often dissonant, his music rises to ferocious climaxes, relieved, especially in his later works, by lyrical oases (&quot;&quot;).

Pettersson&#x27;s music has a very distinctive sound and can hardly be confused with that of any other 20th-century composer. His symphonies, which range from 22 to 70 minutes long, are typically one-movement works. Pettersson&#x27;s music is demanding on performers and listeners.

Pettersson quoted songs from his own 24 &quot;Barefoot Songs&quot; in several of his compositions.

Musicologist Ivanka Stoïanova designed a theory of musical space about Pettersson&#x27;s music.

Most of his music has now been recorded at least once and much of it is now available in published scores.

===Works===
Pettersson began composing songs and smaller chamber works in the 1930s.

His production from the 1940s includes the song cycle twenty-four &quot;Barefoot Songs&quot; (1943–1945) based on his poems and a dissonant concerto for violin and string quartet (1949), which is influenced by Béla Bartók and Paul Hindemith. Pettersson soon found his own compositional style.
In 1951, he created the experimental &quot;Seven Sonatas for two Violins&quot;. At the same time, he composed the first of his seventeen symphonies, which he left unfinished. This work has been recorded in a performing version prepared by trombonist and conductor Christian Lindberg in 2011.
Pettersson about the symphonic output of the 1950s: 
It took four years to write the conceptual and style-defining Symphony No. 6 (1963–1966). His Symphony No. 7 and Symphony No. 8 (1968–1969) have been recorded more than his other works and are probably his best-known. In the 1970s, he composed two related works about social protest and compassion, the Symphony No. 12 for mixed chorus and orchestra (1973–1974) to poems by Literature Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda with contemporary relevance and the cantata &quot;Vox Humana&quot; (1974) on texts by Latin American poets. During the prolific last decade of his life, he also wrote a concerto for violin and orchestra (1977–1978, 1980) written for the violinist Ida Haendel, a Symphony No. 16 (1979) which features a bravura solo part for alto saxophone commissioned by American saxophonist Frederick L. Hemke, and an incomplete, posthumously discovered concerto for viola and orchestra (1979–1980).

==Legacy==
In 1968–1969, conductor and composer Antal Doráti arranged eight of Pettersson&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot Songs&quot; as full-scale orchestral songs.

Choreographer Birgit Cullberg produced three ballets based on Pettersson&#x27;s music. (1976, Symphony No. 7), (1977, Concerto No. 1 for String Orchestra), (&quot;War Dance&quot;) (1979, Symphony No. 9).

The four orchestral sketches &quot;&quot; (1991) by Peter Ruzicka are a tribute to Pettersson&#x27;s life and work, quoting sketches of his unfinished Symphony No. 17.

Roy Andersson used the finale of Symphony No. 7 in his short film &quot;World of Glory&quot; ().

After Pettersson&#x27;s death, the (International Allan Pettersson Society) issued six yearbooks, Classic Produktion Osnabrück CPO began recording his complete works, and a series of concerts (in 1994–1995) programmed almost all of them.

In 2002, a Swedish Allan Pettersson Society () has been founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allan Pettersson Sällskapet / The Swedish Allan Pettersson Society 2018 n827&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="1062962" wikidata="Q5215426" url="?curid=1062962" title="Danceteria">
<text>Danceteria was a nightclub that operated in New York City from May 1980 until 1986 and in the Hamptons until 1995. The club operated in various locations over the years, a total of three in New York City and four in the Hamptons. The most famous location was the second, a four-floor venue at 30 West 21st Street in Manhattan that served as the location for the disco scene in the film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;.

==History==
The first Danceteria was opened at 252 West 37th Street by German expatriate Rudolf Piper and talent booker Jim Fouratt. It catered to a diverse after-hours crowd coming from the downtown rock clubs Mudd Club, Trax, Tier 3, Chinese Chance, CBGB, and gay discos. The club&#x27;s DJs were Mark Kamins and Sean Cassette. The Video Lounge was designed by video artists John Sanborn and Kit Fitzgerald, who programmed an eclectic mix of found footage, video art, early music videos, and musical performances. DJ Mark Kamins said Danceteria was the first club to play videos and have two separate DJs play for 12 straight hours. 
In October 1980, the New York liquor licensing authorities raided Danceteria, and 35 employees were arrested for selling liquor without a license. Less than a month later the club was shut down again for liquor code violations.

In 1982, John Argento hired Fouratt and Piper to promote and book the talent for what became the 21st Street Danceteria. The club operated out of the first three floors in an old industrial 12-story building. (Later the 4th floor was used as Congo Bill, and the abandoned 5th floor was once used as a performance space by Karen Finley.) The roof was also open in the warmer months with frequent barbeques.

The club opened to massive crowds and critical acclaim. The regular DJs on the main dance second floor were Mark Kamins on Saturday nights and Bill Bahlman on Thursdays and Fridays. Bill Bahlman was the in-house DJ at the uptown club Hurrah. Bill brought his huge following with him to Danceteria. The second floor DJ booth was custom-built for Bill&#x27;s 6&#x27;2&quot; height. Other DJ&#x27;s on the second floor included Louis Martinez (Louis Orlando), who had cameos at places like Studio 54 and Lolo, Richard Sweret, and Jody Kurilla. Bill Bahlman, Richard Sweret and Randa Relich Milliron ran the Experimental First Floor serving as both DJs and VJs during the club&#x27;s first months of operation until Fouratt&#x27;s ousting; former Mudd Club DJ Anita Sarko spun on the first floor, where the bands performed, as well as in the VIP room, Congo Bill, for special events. The Video Lounge was located on the third floor of the new space and Ben Salzman &amp; Jessica Jason, continued the artistic quality of the Video Lounge. Danny Cornyetz made videos of some of the acts with the fixed ceiling camera that piped what was happening on the first-floor stage throughout the club.

Three months after opening, Argento and Piper dismissed Fouratt and hired Ruth Polsky as the club&#x27;s talent booker. Under Polsky&#x27;s direction, the club became renowned as one of the centers of new wave music in New York and was frequented by many musicians and artists who became famous during the decade, such as Madonna, New Order, Duran Duran, Billy Idol, Sade, Wham!, R.E.M., the Smiths, Squeeze, Cyndi Lauper, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Run-DMC, Depeche Mode, Butthole Surfers, The Fall, the B-52&#x27;s, Samhain, Bauhaus, RuPaul, Berlin, Units, Romeo Void, Sonic Youth, Swans, Stephen Merritt, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, the Cult, Karen Finley, Violent Femmes, Soft Cell, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, and Rob Zombie.

Famed New York City doorman Haoui Montaug worked as a doorman at Danceteria.

In 1984, Argento and Piper opened a successful Hamptons outpost of Danceteria in Water Mill, New York. This was the first trendy NYC-style nightclub to open in the Hamptons. Bill Bahlman DJ&#x27;ed the opening night of The Hamptons Danceteria.

The third Danceteria operated from 1990 to 1993 in a run-down midtown space, the Martha Washington Hotel at 30 East 30th Street. Kamins, Johnny Dynell, Walter V and Danceteria veteran Freddy Bastone were the DJs at this facility; NJ rock band Spare Change performed regularly on the main stage, usually inciting riots with their raw brand of rock music. Club Kid Goldy Loxxx DJed on the opening night in the lounge room, and for the first few Friday nights (along with Kamins) in the main room, one of the first times a club personality was chosen to spin.

In 2008, the 21st Street location was sold, to be converted to luxury condominiums. The plan was abandoned by the end of the year.

In 2021, acclaimed DJ Rafe Gomez launched Danceteria REWIND, a weekly two-hour livestream mix show on Twitch. Danceteria REWIND re-creates the unique multi-genre soundtrack that defined the Danceteria experience.

Using original DJ playlists as well as extensive research, Gomez&#x27;s seamless blend replicates Danceteria&#x27;s distinctive sonic presentation by merging the myriad genres that were featured on the club&#x27;s five floors between 1979 and 1986 - including reggae/dub, old-school hip hop, early techno/electronica/industrial, mutant disco and post-disco, 70s funk, dancefloor punk, B-side new wave, salsa/Latin boogaloo, and independent releases by popular downtown bands.

<text>The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) is an American Christian media production and distribution organization. Founded in 1960 by Pat Robertson, it produces the long-running TV series &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, co-produces the ongoing &quot;Superbook&quot; anime, and has operated a number of TV channels and radio stations. Its headquarters are in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States.

CBN has been described as having been &quot;at the forefront of the culture wars since the network&#x27;s inception in the early 1960s&quot;.

== Operations ==
One of the company&#x27;s mainstays is &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, which uses a religious variety program that mixes sermons, interviews, and religious music (such as hymns and gospel). The name refers to a fundraising drive where Robertson successfully sought 700 viewers willing to contribute $10 a month to sustain the station. &quot;The 700 Club&quot; is the longest-running program in the variety format. Initially focused on devotional content, &quot;The 700 Club&quot; became increasingly political in the late 1970s, adding news segments.

Today, CBN News provides news updates to &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and produces religious news and political opinion commentary programs such as &quot;CBN NewsWatch&quot; and &quot;Christian World News&quot;; it also produces a special hour-long block of prime time election coverage hosted by Robertson during American presidential and mid-term elections, airing on Freeform, which also carries &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and the half-hour talk show &quot;700 Club Interactive&quot;. CBN also operates the CBN News Channel. The company also produces a version of &quot;The 700 Club&quot; aimed at Spanish speaking Americans (&quot;Club 700 Hoy&quot;).

CBN Asia manages Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation (OBI), an international relief and missionary effort, and has international programming, producing local programs including &quot;Solusi&quot; in Indonesia and &quot;From Heart to Heart&quot; in Thailand.

CBN India produces three shows, a daily Hindi program &quot;Ek Nayee Zindagi&quot;, a bi-weekly Telugu program &quot;Nireekshana&quot; and an award-winning weekly Bengali program &quot;Samadhan&quot;.

CBN has broadcast programs in over 70 languages.

CBN now serves mainly as a production company for &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, and four other syndicated shows: &quot;CBN NewsWatch&quot;, &quot;Christian World News&quot;, &quot;700 Club Interactive&quot; and &quot;The Brody File&quot;, a news-analysis program hosted by one-time political journalist David Brody.

Some of CBN&#x27;s programs also air on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Cornerstone Television, FamilyNet, LeSEA Broadcasting Corporation, TCT and Middle East Television, all of which are Evangelical Christian networks. The secular commercial stations that continue to air &quot;The 700 Club&quot; in syndication (along with Freeform) air CBN&#x27;s annual telethon during the last week of January.

The Charity Navigator gave CBN a 3-star overall rating (out of a maximum four stars), a 3-star financial rating and a 2-star accountability and transparency rating.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
CBN was founded in 1960 in Portsmouth, Virginia by Pat Robertson, who had recently become a born-again Christian. CBN entered into the broadcasting industry in October 1961, when WYAH-TV (WTOV-TV) in Portsmouth – the group&#x27;s flagship station – signed on the air. Its programming was funded by small donations from individuals and local churches.

In August 1962, WYAH-TV was joined by an FM sister station, Norfolk-licensed WXRI, which broadcast a format of Christian music and teaching programs.

In 1966, a daily talk program began on WYAH, which eventually became known as &quot;The 700 Club&quot;.

On July 7, 1968, CBN acquired the Neuvo Continente radio station in Bogota, Colombia (which was the first evangelical radio station in that country).

In 1969 the organisation established CBN Northeast, a simulcast network of five FM radio stations in upstate New York (WBIV in Wethersfield, WEIV in Ithaca, WJIV in Cherry Valley, WMIV in South Bristol and WOIV in DeRuyter). (The stations were previously the Rural Radio Network.)

CBN signed on WHAE-TV in Atlanta in June 1971. In January 1973, CBN purchased KBFI-TV in Dallas and changed its callsign to KXTX-TV. The ministry signed on its final station, WXNE-TV in Boston, in October 1977.

The ministry&#x27;s broadcasting subsidiary, the Continental Broadcasting Network, ran its four over-the-air outlets as family-oriented independent stations – featuring a mix of religious programming (which took up most of its stations&#x27; Sunday schedules) and secular acquired programs, including westerns, sitcoms, drama series and children&#x27;s programming. (This format that would be later adopted by the LeSEA Broadcasting Corporation when it began launching its own television stations in the 1970s.)

CBN transferred Neuovo Continente to Colombian pastor and broadcaster Ignacio Guevara on June 7, 1972.

&quot;The International 700 Club&quot; was first broadcast on November 7, 1976, in the Philippines. This 30 minute version of the US show was to go on to be broadcast in many other countries. This later became known as &quot;The 700 Club International&quot;.

On April 29, 1977, CBN launched a religious channel in the United States, the CBN Satellite Service.

Also that year, CBN University was founded. It was established for &quot;the specific purpose of preparing leaders who would not only succeed in their professions but also advance as Christians equipped to effectively impact their world.&quot; Its first classes began in September 1978.

Affiliated charity &quot;Operation Blessing&quot; was set up on November 14, 1978. It was initially intended to help struggling individuals and families by matching their needs for items such as clothing, appliances, and vehicles with donated items from viewers of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;. Coordinating with local churches and other organizations, OBI expanded their matching funds program to also include food provisions and financial assistance for low-income families.

In June 1979, CBN joined George Otis Ministries to build a combined radio and TV station in Southern Lebanon. It then began to broadcast Christian programming 28 hours a week in Hebrew.

=== The 1980s ===
CBN relocated its main headquarters from Portsmouth to Virginia Beach in 1980. About this time, CBN co-commissioned the first Superbook series of anime. This series was subsequently dubbed in many languages and distributed broadly across the world.

In June 1981,&quot;The 700 Club&quot; changed from being a religious talk show to having a news magazine format.

The CBN Satellite Service became the CBN Cable Network on September 1, 1981, and adopted a more secular programming format featuring a mix of family-oriented series and films while retaining some religious programs from various televangelists (mirroring the format used by CBN&#x27;s broadcast stations). Its carriage grew to 10.9 million homes with a cable television subscription. The channel was notable for being one of the first cable channels to distribute its signal across the United States through satellite transmission (the third overall, after HBO and TBS). CBN Cable Network began airing a late night block of classic family oriented shows like &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; with Groucho Marx, &quot;I Married Joan&quot;, and &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

The upstate New York radio stations were sold in 1982.

On April 10, 1982, a Christian-based television station in South Lebanon, Hope TV, was donated to CBN, and became Middle East Television (METV). At this time METV broadcast from Marjayoun. In Israel, METV was known for broadcasting WWF wrestling that was not available on Israeli TV. The station broadcast news, sports, family entertainment, and religious programming.

In August 1988, the CBN Cable Network became The CBN Family Channel.

Three of the over-the-air TV stations were sold between 1984 and 1989. WXRI radio in Portsmouth was also sold in 1989.

=== The 1990s ===
On January 8, 1990, the national TV network was sold to related entity International Family Entertainment (IFE). IFE was majority owned by the Robertson family, with a minority interest held by John C. Malone. The sale was said to have been done because the channel had become too profitable for CBN to maintain its non-profit status. On September 15 that year, the newly sold channel rebranded as The Family Channel. It remained the most watched outlet for CBN programs. IFE went on to launch other TV channels in the US and UK, and planned to extend itself further.

1990 also saw CBN University become known as &quot;Regent University&quot;. CBN built luxury hotel &quot;The Founders Inn and Spa&quot; at the university campus, and this was completed in 1990. The name of the hotel refers to the US Founding Fathers.

The year 1990 was also when CBN programs began to be broadcast in the Soviet Union, and then in its successor states after they declared independence. It started with primetime specials, and later The 700 Club and Superbook. These broadcasts were followed by 190 rallies throughout the region that resulted in the establishment of 190 churches. Similar special projects were implemented in the Philippines and Romania in 1994.

On June 5, 1997, METV launched its 24-hour programming broadcast on the Israeli satellite Amos 2. This allowed it to reach a potential audience of 200 million people in 15 nations including Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Cyprus.

IFE was sold to News Corporation later in June 1997. At this time, The Family Channel was the US&#x27;s ninth largest cable network, reaching 67 million homes. The terms of the sale stipulated that the channel continue carrying &quot;The 700 Club&quot; in perpetuity. Pat Robertson said that &quot;We expect to continue to benefit from The Family Channel&#x27;s... growing family entertainment franchise.&quot; (The Family Channel was renamed &quot;Fox Family Channel&quot; in August 1998. The channel was then sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2001, which renamed it as &quot;ABC Family&quot;, later renaming it again to Freeform.)

On March 24, 1999, the inaugural live broadcast of &quot;The 700 Club Asia&quot; aired.

<doc id="1062975" wikidata="Q4353638" url="?curid=1062975" title="The Seer (Big Country album)">
<text>The Seer is the third studio album by the Scottish band Big Country, released in 1986. The album featured very traditional Scottish musical settings, reminiscent of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Crossing&quot; (1983). Kate Bush worked on the title song in a duet with lead singer and lyricist Stuart Adamson. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Look Away&quot;, was an Irish number one, and was also the group&#x27;s biggest hit single in the UK, reaching number 7.

The album reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart.

==Lyrics and music==
&quot;The Seer&quot; saw Big Country return to the sweeping Scottish sound that had made them famous on &quot;The Crossing&quot;. It is sometimes considered to be the band&#x27;s most overtly Celtic album, with many of the songs containing explicit or veiled references to Scottish history - for example, &quot;Remembrance Day&quot; deals with the Highland Clearances (in which thousands of Highlanders were relocated to British colonial possessions such as Canada and New Zealand), &quot;Red Fox&quot; is about the 1752 Appin Murder, and the title track concerns the seventeenth century mystic the Brahan Seer.

==Mixes==
The album was given two separate mixes. The first was done by producer Robin Millar with the input of the band. This mix was rejected by the band&#x27;s record label for being not commercial enough, and Walter Turbitt was brought in to remix the album. Turbitt&#x27;s mix, which was eventually released, was disliked by the band, as it had more overtly poppy elements (such as added reverberation) in contrast to Millar&#x27;s drier, crisper mix. The original mix remains unreleased, with the exception of &quot;Look Away,&quot; the single version of which was released before the remix had been completed.

==Reception==
Critic Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;The Seer&quot; a positive review, calling it &quot;possibly [the band&#x27;s] strongest effort to date&quot;:

<text>Manly Beach is a beach situated among the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. From north to south, the three main sections are Queenscliff, North Steyne and South Steyne.

==Etymology==

The beach was named by Captain Arthur Phillip for the indigenous people living there. He wrote, &quot;Their confidence and manly behaviour made me give the name of Manly Cove to this place&quot;.

==Commercial area==
Within walking distance of Manly Beach along the oceanway is Fairy Bower and Shelly Beach. There are shops, restaurants, night clubs, and bars in town.

==Patrol==
Northern Beaches Council lifeguards operate a year-round service at South Steyne, and operate from October to April at North Steyne and Queenscliff. Lifesavers from Manly Life Saving Club also patrol on weekends and public holidays between October and May.

==Access==
Travelling to Manly from Sydney&#x27;s main ferry terminal, Circular Quay, takes 22 to 30 minutes by ferry. The Corso, a pedestrian plaza and one of Manly&#x27;s main streets for shopping and dining, runs from the Manly wharf and harbour beach, across the peninsula to Manly Beach, where it marks the boundary between North Steyne and South Steyne.

<doc id="1062984" wikidata="Q7067814" url="?curid=1062984" title="Nuaulu people">
<text>The Nuaulu, Naulu or Nunuhai are an ethnic group located in Seram, Maluku, Indonesia.

==Description==
The group name &#x27;Nuaulu&#x27; means head[waters] of the Nua River, which is the ancestral homeland of the Nuaulu people. In the late 19th century or early 20th century, the Nuaulu people were moved down to the coast by the Dutch for purposes of pacification.

The Nuaulu are divided into two groups, namely the northern and the southern groups. Numbering at a total of 2500 people, they live in the Amahai district of Central Seram. The Northern Nuaulu inhabit two villages on the north coast of central Seram Island, whilst the Southern group inhabit five villages on the south coast and interior of Amahai District. These two languages are not mutually intelligible.

== Religion ==
The majority of the Nuaulu people still adhere to their traditional religion which is based on a belief that the ancestors control everyday life and if the traditions they handed down are not followed correctly the living will be punished with sickness, death, and lack of prosperity. Nuaulu religion also states that there is an original creator called Upu Kuanahatana, and that there is powerful magic which people can use for good, or bad, purposes. Nuaulu people build Baileo for spiritual purposes.

==Culture==
The Nuaulu people are often mistakenly referred to as the Manusela people, who like the Nuaulu people wear a traditional red cloth on their heads, speak a similar language and practice the same traditional beliefs, the Naurus.

The Nuaulu retained a custom of headhunting until the 1940s.

==Livelihood==
Sago is the staple food of the Nuaulu. Nuaulu are subsistence farmers who use shifting cultivation techniques; they also grow cash crops such as coconuts, cloves, and nutmeg.

==Honors==
The Nuaulu people are honored in the scientific name of a species of gecko, &quot;Cyrtodactylus nuaulu&quot;, which is native to Seram Island.

<doc id="1062987" wikidata="Q609551" url="?curid=1062987" title="Arthur Ashe Stadium">
<text>Arthur Ashe Stadium is a tennis arena at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City. Part of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, it is the main stadium of the US Open tennis tournament and has a capacity of 23,771, making it the largest tennis stadium in the world.

The stadium is named after Arthur Ashe (1943–1993), winner of the inaugural 1968 US Open, the first in which professionals could compete. The original stadium design, completed in 1997, had not included a roof. After suffering successive years of event delays from inclement weather, a new lightweight retractable roof was completed in 2016.

==History==

Arthur Ashe Stadium occupies the site of the United States Pavilion, which was built for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair and demolished in 1977. The facility, which opened in 1997, replaced Louis Armstrong Stadium as the primary venue for the tournament. It cost $254 million to construct, and it originally had 22,547 seats, 90 luxury suites, five restaurants, and a two-level players&#x27; lounge, making it by far the largest tennis-only venue in the world. Like the other in the facility, it has a DecoTurf cushioned acrylic surface.

On August 25, 1997, the stadium opened by hosting the US Open, with Whitney Houston singing &quot;One Moment in Time&quot; during the stadium&#x27;s inauguration ceremonies and dedicating the performance to the late Arthur Ashe.

The first official match played on the court was at the 1997 US Open between Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand and Chanda Rubin of the United States. Tanasugarn won in two sets.

The facility features a Hawk-Eye electronic system which allows tennis players to challenge the umpire&#x27;s decision on calls made throughout championships. In 2005, the color scheme for the courts was changed from green to electric blue inner courts and a light green outer court. All US Open Series events now use this color scheme, providing television viewers a more easily trackable ball — with the yellow tennis balls contrasting more visibly against the blue courts.
== Non-tennis events ==
On July 19, 2008, the stadium hosted its first non-tennis event, a WNBA outdoor game known as the Liberty Outdoor Classic; it was the first-ever outdoor regular season game in professional basketball. The Indiana Fever beat the host New York Liberty . Portions of proceeds from the event went to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

On July 26–28, 2019, the stadium hosted the &quot;Fortnite&quot; World Cup, a three-day long esports tournament with a prize pool of 30 million, $3 million of which awarded to the winner of the Finals.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the stadium was converted for use as a hospital.

On September 22, 2021, professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) broadcast special episodes of its weekly programs &quot;Dynamite&quot; and &quot;Rampage&quot; from Arthur Ashe Stadium, billed as &quot;AEW Grand Slam&quot; The event marked AEW&#x27;s debut show in New York City and the first professional wrestling show ever held at the tennis complex. &quot;Grand Slam&quot; was held at the stadium again in 2022, 2023, and 2024.

After having been displaced from its traditional February scheduling and Madison Square Garden due to COVID-19, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show re-located to the complex for 2023 and 2024, with Arthur Ashe Stadium serving as the main venue. It returned to MSG in 2025.

== Retractable roof ==

Lacking a roof, where relatively strong and unpredictable winds could occur inside the stadium, events were vulnerable to inclement weather—and five straight years of rain delays occurred during the US Open men&#x27;s singles final from 2008 to 2012.

Despite the original design&#x27;s lacking provisions for a roof, the USTA announced in 2013 plans to construct a roof for the stadium using a superstructure—having consulted &quot;with every architect involved in the design of a stadium roof in North America.&quot;

Notably, the site of the Ashe center featured poor soil conditions. It had previously been Manhattan&#x27;s Corona Ash Dumps (featured prominently in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as the Valley of Ashes) and prior to that a natural wetland swamp. For the new roof, a very light solution was critical.

The roof has two 800-ton fabric panels made of of lightweight PTFE membrane which can open or close on glides, up to 25 feet per minute, to create an opening roughly the size of 17 Olympic swimming pools. The stadium is not fully conditioned; a new chilled water ventilation system controls humidity when the roof is closed. The new cantilevering design is supported by eight columns that sit on concrete bases, each supported by 20 piles driven 150 to 200 feet deep and has a data acquisition and recording system along with synchronized cameras to interpret the data created by the complex control systems. The roof, which cost $150 million, was part of a $550 million renovation of the National Tennis Center. The retractable roof project was completed in 2016.

The roof was designed by Rossetti Architects and its structure engineered by WSP Global. Geiger Engineers designed the roof&#x27;s mechanization system. Engineer of Record for the mechanization system was Hardesty &amp; Hanover in partnership with Morgan Engineering.

<text>The 1986 Tour de France was a cycling race held in France, from 4 July to 27 July. It was the 73rd running of the Tour de France. Greg LeMond of won the race, ahead of his teammate Bernard Hinault. It was the first ever victory for a rider outside of Europe. Five-time Tour winner Hinault, who had won the year before with LeMond supporting him, had publicly pledged to ride in support of LeMond in 1986. Several attacks during the race cast doubt on the sincerity of his promise, leading to a rift between the two riders and the entire La Vie Claire team. The 1986 Tour de France is widely considered to be one of the most memorable in the history of the sport due to the battle between LeMond and Hinault.

Thierry Marie () took the first race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey after winning the prologue time trial. The lead then moved to Alex Stieda () after stage 1, only for Marie to recapture the lead after his team won the team time trial on stage 2. After short stints in the lead for Dominique Gaigne and Johan van der Velde, Jørgen V. Pedersen took the yellow jersey following a breakaway on stage 7 and retained the lead even after the first long time trial, won by Hinault. Stage 12 saw Hinault attack with Pedro Delgado (), who won the stage, while Hinault moved into the lead. Hinault attacked again the following day, but was caught and dropped. LeMond gained back significant time, but still trailed his teammate by 40 seconds.

LeMond would move into the yellow jersey after stage 17, when Hinault fell behind on the climb of the Col d&#x27;Izoard. Stage 18 to Alpe d&#x27;Huez saw LeMond and Hinault finish hand-in-hand, with the latter winning the stage. LeMond&#x27;s overall victory was sealed when Hinault was unable to overcome his deficit in the final time trial on stage 20. Urs Zimmermann () finished third, and was the only rider who posed a threat to the La Vie Claire team, who also had the 4th placed rider in Andy Hampsten.

In the race&#x27;s other classifications, Hinault won the mountains classification, rider Eric Vanderaerden the points classification, and &#x27;s Andrew Hampsten won the young rider classification. finished at the head of the team classification by one hour 51 minutes, after placing four riders inside the final overall top-ten placings.

One of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours, the Tour consisted of 23 stages, beginning with a prologue in Boulogne-Billancourt and concluded on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The race was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation and was shown on television in 72 countries, with the total viewers estimated at one billion.

==Teams==
In June, 23 teams had requested to start in the 1986 Tour. The Tour organisers, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), accepted 21 applications, so a total of 21 teams participated in the 1986 Tour de France. The two teams whose application was denied were Skala-Skil and Miko. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race would start with a peloton of 210 cyclists, a record setting total. The ASO felt that 210 starters were too many and moved to reduce the size of the squads to eight riders each, but the teams protested, and the original number remained.

 became the Tour&#x27;s first team from the United States, with a squad consisting of eight Americans, one Canadian and one Mexican. Jim Ochowicz, &#x27;s founder and manager, met with the ASO and persuaded them to invite his team. In the Spring, the team withdrew from competition in Europe (missing the opportunity to become the first American team in the history of the Vuelta a España) due to the United States conflict with Libya, losing out on much needed competitive racing unavailable in the United States. Joop Zoetemelk, the reigning road world champion, started and finished his 16th Tour de France, a record that stood until it was tied by Sylvain Chavanel in 2018.

The teams entering the race were:

==Pre-race favourites==
Five-time Tour winner and defending champion Bernard Hinault () had promised to support his teammate Greg LeMond, who had finished second in 1985, following controversy during that race when LeMond felt that a chance of potential victory had been taken from him due to team tactics. was therefore considered the squad to beat, with the team also featuring strong riders such as Andrew Hampsten, who had won the Tour de Suisse several weeks before the Tour de France. Before the start of the event, Hinault announced it would be the last Tour de France of his career. Prior to the start of the Tour, LeMond was confident of his chances, and pointed out that having Hinault, who he expected to take an early lead, would play to his advantage. Even with Hinault&#x27;s assurances of support for LeMond, excitement over a possible record-breaking sixth Tour win was high in France. In a survey of 15 Dutch journalists, eight named Hinault as their main favourite for overall victory, just three chose LeMond. LeMond&#x27;s season up to this point had been good, but had not yielded any major victories; he finished second at Milan–San Remo, third at Paris–Nice, fourth at the Giro d&#x27;Italia and third at the Tour de Suisse.

Laurent Fignon (), winner in 1983 and 1984, was working on his comeback, having won the La Flèche Wallonne classic in the spring. He had missed the chance to defend his title the year earlier due to surgery on an inflamed Achilles tendon. Juan Mora of &quot;El País&quot; believed that the race would be highlighted by a duel between Fignon and Hinault. He named LeMond and Frenchman Charly Mottet as potential contenders if their team captains – Hinault and Fignon, respectively – failed to perform to the level expected. Mora believed Pedro Delgado to be the best Spanish contender for the overall title citing that his should perform well in the team time trial. Gian Paolo Ormezzano of &quot;La Stampa&quot; believed that there was no Italian rider competing that could be a legitimate threat to win the race, despite the fact that three Italian based teams were invited – the most since the 1979 edition. Ormezzano also thought the favourites going into the race were Hinault and Fignon. Fignon later recalled in his autobiography that he did not share the view of himself as a favourite, writing: &quot;I felt terrible physically. [...] My body — and perhaps my mind as well — was registering deep fatigue rather than an urge to get on with it.&quot; Stephen Roche (), third overall the year before, had injured his knee in a crash at the Paris Six-Day event in the winter, necessitating surgery in April, which meant that he arrived at the Tour out of form. Five-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil named Luis Herrera () as his main favourite. Herrera himself declared: &quot;If I do not lose more than ten minutes before the mountains, I can win.&quot;

Sean Kelly () was considered the main favourite for victory in the points classification, having won the trophy a record-equalling third time the year before. However, a crash on the last stage of the Tour de Suisse prevented Kelly from starting. In his absence, Adri van der Poel () was given the best chances to win the classification.

==Route and stages==

The race route for the 1986 edition of the Tour de France was unveiled on 8 October 1985 by both Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan. The race was pushed back a week from its normal date in order to prevent overlap with the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and therefore started on 4 July. Covering a total of , it included four time trials (three individual and one for teams) and ten stages deemed as flat. The race included four stages that featured a summit finish: stage 13 to Superbagnères; stage 17 to Col du Granon; stage 18 to Alpe d&#x27;Huez; and stage 21 to Puy de Dôme. The race took a counter-clockwise route around France. Following the prologue and opening stages in the Hauts-de-Seine region, the race moved north towards the Belgian border, before turning west to Brittany. The Tour then traveled south to Bordeaux, where a train transfer brought the riders to Bayonne, at the foot of the Pyrenees. From there, transition stages led the race to the Alps, before the final stages in the Massif Central and further north towards Paris.

The 1986 Tour de France had one rest day, after the finish on the Alpe d&#x27;Huez. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 18. The longest road-race stage was stage 11, at .

Tour director Levitan felt after the 1985 Tour de France that the race had been too easy, and made the course in 1986 extra difficult, including more mountain climbs than before. This angered Hinault, who threatened to skip the 1986 Tour. Before the race started, an avalanche deposited a large amount of dirt and rock on the slopes of the Col du Tourmalet, prompting Goddet to consider rerouting the course through the Col d&#x27;Aubisque.

==Race overview==
===Opening stages===

The prologue was won by Thierry Marie (), with Hinault in third place, just two seconds slower. Fignon and LeMond placed seventh and eighth, both four seconds back. On stage 1, Alex Stieda () attacked from the finish and collected time bonuses at the intermediate sprint, which would move him into the race lead. He was then joined in his breakaway by five other riders. The sextet held a small margin until the finish, with Pol Verschuere () taking the victory. Stieda, a Canadian, became the first rider from North America to wear the race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey.

The same afternoon, the team time trial was held. The attempt at defending Stieda&#x27;s race lead by his team proved unsuccessful. A crash by Eric Heiden slowed the team and forced several riders to take evasive action in order not to run into him, in the process scraping their tyres at the street curbing, which caused several punctures. In addition, Stieda was tired by his morning effort and fell back, getting in danger of missing the time limit. Chris Carmichael and Jeff Pierce had to fall back to lead him to the finish, which he reached in time but the yellow jersey was lost. It was regained by Marie, whose team won the time trial, while lost almost two minutes. Hinault personally instructed the team to wait for Niki Rüttimann and Guido Winterberg, who were nursing the after-effects of crashes during the morning stage, accounting for &#x27;s comparatively poor performance. lost significant time and four of the team&#x27;s riders were eliminated because they missed the time limit.

 bounced back from their disappointment the following day, with Davis Phinney becoming the first American to win a road race stage. Phinney won the stage from a bunch sprint, even though he had been in the day&#x27;s breakaway for most of the stage. Stage 4 went through Normandy, on rolling terrain. Régis Simon () broke away from the peloton and at from the finish, he held a lead of over ten minutes. He was eventually caught by a counterattack from Federico Echave (). On the finishing straight, Pello Ruiz Cabestany () overtook Echave to win the stage. Dutch champion Jos Lammertink () retired after suffering a broken skull in a crash, while Fabio Parra () also dropped out, courtesy of knee problems, leaving his team with only five of their original ten starters. Dominique Gaigne took over the yellow jersey from his teammate Marie, who he now led by six seconds.

Johan van der Velde () won stage 5 and through time bonuses at both intermediate sprints and the stage finish, moved into the overall lead. He got the better of Joël Pelier () at the finish line. Both had been in a breakaway together, started after ridden. They finished 39 seconds ahead of van der Velde&#x27;s teammate Eddy Planckaert, who in turn was followed by Miguel Induráin (), while the field, led by Alfonso Gutiérrez (), was 1:15 minutes behind. The stage saw a demonstration by workers in Lisieux, which did not impede the race. Van der Velde kept the race lead the following day. A five-man breakaway decided the outcome of the stage, won by Guido Bontempi of ahead of Roberto Pagnin ().

The yellow jersey changed hands again after stage 7. The stage began slowly, with the first breakaway established only after . The peloton was back together after , but another attack went shortly thereafter, including Ludo Peeters (), Jørgen V. Pedersen (), and Induráin. Other riders joined them later, but it was Peeters who eventually won the sprint from the group to win the stage, ahead of Ron Kiefel (). Pedersen took the race lead. On stage 8, after the peloton allowed Yvon Madiot () to drive ahead of the field to greet his family. Planckaert, not realising the situation, followed what he considered an attack in the company of Pelier, but all three were brought back. About later, another group broke away, containing Adri van der Poel (), Mathieu Hermans, () and Andrew Hampsten. Hampsten was considered a threat to the overall classification, which led the field to give chase. The peloton was united before their arrival in the finishing town, Nantes, where Silvano Contini () launched an unsuccessful breakaway attempt. Planckert, who only started the stage with the help of analgesic pills from his masseur due to back pain, won the sprint, beating out his teammate Eric Vanderaerden. Pedersen retained the overall lead.

===First long time trial and transition to the mountains===
The first real test for the general classification contenders came on stage 9, a individual time trial around Nantes. Hinault won the stage, 44 seconds ahead of LeMond, with Roche third, 1:01 minutes slower. Hinault benefited from a puncture by LeMond, which cost him time. Fignon finished in 32nd place, 3:42 minutes behind Hinault, a result he later described as &quot;unworthy of my status&quot;. Pedersen did enough to retain the yellow jersey. Roche moved into second place, 1:05 minutes behind Pedersen, with Hinault a further five seconds behind in third. LeMond was eighth, 1:59 minutes behind the lead.

Stage 10 was won by Ángel Sarrapio (), who had been in a breakaway with Jean-Claude Bagot () during the stage. Pedersen kept the race lead, while Pelier used bonus seconds on the road to move ahead of Roche into second place in the general classification. On stage 11, a 12-man breakaway reached the finishing town of Bordeaux together. Rudy Dhaenens () escaped from the group from the finish. On the finishing straight, he was almost caught by the fast approaching Hermans and just held on to take the stage victory. Hermans would later say that the public announcer had aided Dhaenens&#x27; victory by warning him of Hermans over the PA system.

===Pyrenees===

Following a train transfer from Bordeaux to Bayonne at the foot of the Pyrenees in the morning, stage 12 led the riders over to Pau. The stage featured five mountain passes, with the first-category rated Col de Marie-Blanque at the end, before a descent into the finishing town. Several attacks occurred over the first part of the stage, each covered by riders of . At around from the finish, Hinault raised the pace on the ascent of the Col de Burdincurutcheta, forcing other contenders to chase back on, such as Herrera. Others, such as Roche, Fignon, and race leader Pedersen, dropped behind and would lose a lot of time by the end of the stage. Shortly before an intermediate sprint after , Hinault told his teammate Jean-François Bernard to accelerate, and the two, accompanied by Delgado, made the bridge to a lead group containing Eduardo Chozas (). These four riders then broke clear at the front, before Chozas lost contact about later. Bernard, the work for his team leader done, fell back another down the road. Delgado and Hinault worked well together to extend their advantage to the chasers, where LeMond, bound by team tactics, was unable to give chase himself. According to Delgado, Hinault clearly wanted to make time for the overall classification, and without any negotiating between the two, he gifted the stage win to Delgado. LeMond managed to break clear of the rest of the chase group with Herrera, but still arrived in Pau 4:37 minutes behind Hinault, who was now leading the race overall. After the stage, LeMond was overheard telling his father: &quot;Goddamnit, Dad, I am going to finish second again!&quot; Other favourites lost even more time: Robert Millar () finished 11th, 5:31 minutes behind. In 20th place was Fignon, arriving 11 minutes after Hinault. Roche lost 21 minutes, Phil Anderson () 33 minutes.
Stage 13 led the race through the Pyrenees again, over and four high mountain passes. The first was the Col du Tourmalet, coming after , followed by the Col d&#x27;Aspin, the Col de Peyresourde, and the final climb up to the ski resort of Superbagnères. Laurent Fignon had fallen ill with a fever and did not start the stage. Shortly after the start of the stage, Dominique Arnaud () attacked. When he began the ascent of the Tourmalet, he held a lead of 13 minutes over the field. A select group of favourites crossed the summit, led by Millar, now just over 7 minutes behind Arnaud. As they began the descent, Hinault attacked again, opening a gap to his opponents. As he reached the valley, his lead was at 43 seconds. Behind him, LeMond found himself again in a situation where he was unable to chase his teammate himself, while this time, the entire team was stunned by Hinault&#x27;s attack, explicitly breaking the tactics the team had agreed upon in the morning, which was to sit back and have the other teams attack them. At the summit of the Aspin, Hinault&#x27;s lead had increased to two minutes and he caught up with Arnaud on the subsequent descent. However, unlike the day before, the other favourites worked together to give chase, with Millar, Herrera, and Urs Zimmermann () committed to bringing Hinault back as the group reached the climb of the Peyresourde. They made contact with him on the descent and as the group began the final climb to Superbagnères, it became clear that Hinault had overexerted himself, falling back quickly. Hampsten, who had caught up with the LeMond group, attacked during the early part of the climb to soften up the opposition for LeMond. While Herrera suffering from cramp dropped back to his team car, LeMond counter-attacked, leaving Zimmermann and Millar behind and joined his teammate at the head of the race. With Hampsten falling behind soon after, LeMond continued to the finish alone and won the stage. Hinault trailed in eleventh, 4:39 minutes behind LeMond. He therefore maintained the lead of the race overall, but now just 40 seconds ahead of second-placed LeMond. Incidentally, LeMond had gained back the exact amount of time he had lost the previous day. At the team hotel later in the evening, owner Bernard Tapie had to intervene in an argument between his two leaders and Andrew Hampsten described the mood on the squad from then on as &quot;super tense&quot;.

===Transition stages to the Alps===
The fourteenth stage led the race to Blagnac and was won by Niki Rüttimann (). The team had placed riders in every escape group of the day, and after about , Rüttimann managed to stay away with three other riders. They exchanged attacks in the final of the stage, with Rüttimann putting in the decisive move to win solo ahead of his pursuers, jumping into eighth place in the general classification. LeMond managed to gain six bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint, closing the gap on Hinault in the general classification to 34 seconds. Frank Hoste () won stage 15 in a two-man sprint against Silvano Contini (). The main field came in just eight seconds behind, but Luis Herrera lost 49 seconds after failing to bridge a gap in the peloton.

The final day before the Alps was stage 16, ending in the town of Gap. The peloton had to endure significant crosswinds during the stage, accompanied by several attacks from the field. After , Hinault was part of a group of four riders splitting away from the field in the winds, quickly making contact with another four-man break to form an escape of eight riders. While Hinault was joined by teammates Rüttimann and Winterberg, the group also contained Zimmermann, third overall. LeMond, crucially, had missed the move, but his three teammates in the breakaway still rode hard tempo, drawing out an advantage of 52 seconds. LeMond, again bound not to chase his own teammates, asked Robert Millar for help, who agreed to have his team do the chase work, while LeMond promised to gift Millar a stage should they finish close together. After , the groups were back together. Jean-François Bernard from won the stage after the two other riders in the final breakaway both punctured a tyre on the descent of the Col d&#x27;Espreaux. He moved up into thirteenth place in the general classification, which meant that now had five riders in the top thirteen places. Because of Hinault&#x27;s breakaway tactics during the stage, Lemond threatened to resign from the race and had to be calmed by Tapie. According to Hampsten, the team was split into three groups: the French riders around Hinault, the two Swiss riders in between, and the other riders on LeMond&#x27;s side. Jean-François Bernard supported this view, saying: &quot;The division was real. Even if it wasn&#x27;t evident day-to-day, or on the surface, it was there the whole Tour. You could feel it.&quot; Hinault was unapologetic, saying: &quot;What&#x27;s his [LeMond&#x27;s] problem? Are his legs hurting? It might be just as well if he quits if he doesn&#x27;t want to win the race any more.&quot;

===Alps===

Stage 17 finished on the Col du Granon, the highest mountain-top finish in Tour history up to that point, at an elevation of . Before the Col du Granon, the riders also had to ride across the Col de Vars and the Col d&#x27;Izoard. Eduardo Chozas () was in a solo breakaway and won the stage. Behind him, Hinault began to struggle on the climb of the Izoard, falling behind the others contenders. He suffered from pain in his left knee, a recurrence of an injury sustained in 1983. LeMond attacked as the group began the descent from the Col d&#x27;Izoard and was joined by Zimmermann. Zimmermann set a strong pace on the final climb to the Col du Granon and took second place on the stage, 6:26 minutes behind Chozas, with LeMond right behind him. Hinault came in thirteenth, losing 3:21 minutes to LeMond, who took over the race lead. LeMond led Zimmermann by 2:24 minutes, with Hinault a further 23 seconds behind. It was the first time that a rider from the USA wore the yellow jersey in the history of the Tour.

The night before stage 18 to Alpe d&#x27;Huez, Hinault called a team meeting, complaining about the fact that Zimmermann now split the two riders. He called for the team to attack Zimmermann the following day, &quot;until he was broken&quot;. Another dispute broke out with LeMond, who pointed out that with a time trial still to come, a discipline that did not favour Zimmermann, there was no need for an all-out attack. Tapie had to talk to the riders until four o&#x27;clock in the morning to handle the situation. Shortly after the start of the stage in Briançon, the first climb of the day was the Col du Lautaret. A breakaway formed, including Herrera and Winterberg, who left their companions on the following climb, the Col du Galibier. Behind them, in the group of favourites, Zimmermann was closely guarding LeMond, while Hinault made several small accelerations to test the opposition. On the descent of the Galibier, Hinault attacked, only into the stage. He caught Herrera and Winterberg and they were joined by LeMond, Bauer and Ruiz Cabestany. As they reached the next small climb, the Col du Télégraphe, Hinault attacked again, going clear on his own. LeMond, having strict instructions from his team not to work with Zimmermann, was again stuck behind. LeMond dropped back to his team car for instructions by coach Paul Köchli, who urged him to attack Zimmermann instead of leading him towards Hinault, who at that point had a lead of about one-and-a-half minutes. LeMond attacked shortly before the summit and opened up a gap to Zimmermann on the descent, eventually catching up to Hinault, together with Bauer and Ruiz Cabestany. Bauer then did the lead work until the foot of the next climb, the Col de la Croix de Fer, where he dropped back. Ruiz Cabestany fell behind soon after. On the ascent, Hinault asked LeMond to ease the tempo, due to his aching knee, and set the pace himself. By the summit, they led Zimmermann by 2:50 minutes. On the descent, both set a high tempo, extending the lead over Zimmermann to 4:30 minutes as they reached the climb of Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Sensing that the French public, clearly favouring Hinault, made LeMond nervous, the former led all the way up the climb, with both riders steadily increasing their advantage over everybody else. Close to the finish line, LeMond drove alongside Hinault, putting his arm around him for a short conversation. At the finish, Hinault took LeMond&#x27;s hand in an apparent gesture of comradery and they crossed the line together, with Hinault taking the stage win. Tapie later revealed that he had orchestrated the moment, having told LeMond before the climb to Alpe d&#x27;Huez that he had effectively won the race and that he should let Hinault take the stage. Zimmermann finished third, 5:15 behind the pair.

The illusion of a &quot;détente&quot; between the two leaders lasted only a few hours. In the evening, both appeared on French television in a joint interview with Jacques Chancel. Asked if the battle between them was over, Hinault answered that it would not be until the final time trial in Saint-Étienne. He reiterated the statement on the following day, the only rest day of the Tour. During a press conference, he declared: &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of what we did together, but let me say one more time: the Tour isn&#x27;t over. Who was stronger on the climb? Go on, ask Greg.&quot; LeMond felt betrayed by Hinault&#x27;s apparent unwillingness to honour the deal between the two riders. Hinault in turn promised that, should LeMond still lead the Tour after the final time trial, he would not attack again. This pledge came at the insistence of Tapie, after LeMond had once again threatened to leave the race should Hinault continue attacking. Pedro Delgado, winner of stage 12 and lying fifth overall, retired from the race during stage 18, having learned of the death of his mother. Robert Millar, having been fourth at the summit of the Galibier, lost over 19 minutes during the later part of the stage, dropping from fourth to eighth overall. In 2015, cycling journalist Peter Cossins called stage 18 &quot;the best remembered on the mountain [Alpe d&#x27;Huez]&quot;, while describing it as &quot;a victory parade rather than a sporting contest.&quot;

===Conclusion===

As the conclusion of the race drew closer, LeMond suspected that the public and a large part of the riders would prefer a record-breaking victory for Hinault. Before the start of stage 19, a journalist suggested to him that 80 per cent of the riders would support Hinault, to which he jokingly replied that he was surprised if twenty per cent supported him. Indeed, Hinault attacked once more during the stage, during the feed zone, a clear breach of cycling etiquette which dictates that no rider should attack while his competitors take on food and drinks. Bauer and Hampsten assisted LeMond in bringing Hinault back into the field. During an intermediate sprint, Hinault gained back two seconds to cut his disadvantage to 2:43 minutes. Julián Gorospe won the stage for , ahead of Anderson. Under growing suspicion that other riders would interfere with his race to favour Hinault, LeMond stated after the stage: &quot;If they want to crash me, I&#x27;d rather they tell me now. I&#x27;d rather give the race to them.&quot; Hinault&#x27;s tactics were confusing to other riders as well. Speaking of the stage, Hampsten later recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s the only time I ever chased a teammate in my life. It felt weird; I felt sick doing it. [...] I knew it was the right thing to do.&quot; Phil Anderson, riding for , was equally angry with Hinault, scolding him publicly after the stage for attacking his teammate in the yellow jersey. The night before the time trial, Tour director Jacques Goddet came to see LeMond at dinner and warned him to watch his water bottles and other equipment, saying: &quot;There are many who do not want you to win.&quot; LeMond heeded this advice, with his parents buying his own food. At the daily doping controls, he left his fingerprint in the sealing wax and photographed the urine bottles. According to LeMond, one rider even offered Hinault to cause a crash for LeMond, but Hinault refused.

The decisive stage of the race was the following day, a time trial around Saint-Étienne. After , LeMond was eight seconds faster than Hinault. However, with raced, LeMond crashed in a right-hand corner. While he was able to get up quickly and resume, his brake rubbed on the front wheel, making it necessary to change bikes. Hinault profited from LeMond&#x27;s mishap to win the stage, but managed to only claw back 25 seconds to his teammate, who finished second. Both were in a class of their own, with Hinault catching up with Zimmermann at the finish line, even though the latter had started three minutes ahead of him. Following the stage, Hinault acknowledged his defeat, stating: &quot;After today, we won&#x27;t fight any more.&quot; LeMond now led Hinault by 2:18 minutes.

Stage 21 was the last to feature significant climbing, finishing at the Puy de Dôme. Hinault, now no longer trying to dislodge LeMond, instead focused on securing his lead in the mountains classification, which he did by collecting maximum points at the top of the Croix de l&#x27;Homme, the first climb of the day. Erich Maechler () won the stage, having moved clear of a leading group at the start of the final ascent. Second was Ludo Peeters (), 34 seconds behind. LeMond came in 6:06 minutes behind, in eighteenth place. Hinault, having worked for his teammate during the stage, fell back on the final climb and lost 43 seconds to LeMond, who extended his overall advantage to 3:10 minutes. Robert Millar, fighting sickness, dropped out during this stage.

Guido Bontempi won the final two stages of the race, first stage 22 into Nevers, edging out Hoste and Vanderaerden in a sprint finish. On the final, ceremonial stage into Paris, LeMond crashed and Hinault made a point to personally escort him back into the field. Hinault then contested the final sprint, won by Bontempi, and finished fourth to close out his Tour de France career. LeMond became the first rider from an English-speaking country to win the event, at an average speed of . Only 132 of the 210 starters finished the race in Paris. Robert Millar described the race as &quot;by far the hardest&quot; Tour he had ridden, adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we ever climbed the mountains so fast.&quot; was the only team to arrive in Paris with all ten starters. The &quot;lanterne rouge&quot;, the last-placed finisher of the race, was Ennio Salvador (), 2:55:51 hours behind LeMond.

===Aftermath===

Perception of the 1986 Tour de France and the rivalry between LeMond and Hinault remain divided. LeMond felt betrayed by Hinault&#x27;s failure to live up to the clear assertion that he would assist him to win the Tour, saying: &quot;He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.&quot; He showed disappointment when the public alleged that he had only won due to Hinault allowing it. Hinault&#x27;s view of the 1986 Tour differs from LeMond&#x27;s. In his autobiography, he wrote:

After the final time trial, Hinault claimed to have attacked repeatedly to toughen LeMond up, adding: &quot;Next year maybe he&#x27;ll have to fight off another opponent who will make life miserable for him. Now he&#x27;ll know how to fight back.&quot; Cycling historians Bill and Carol McGann refuse this argument, writing: &quot;Of course, Hinault reneged on his promise. His words, that he was trying to toughen LeMond or get him to earn his Tour, are obvious nonsense.&quot;

In France, Hinault&#x27;s aggressive riding style was widely celebrated and did much to improve his public image, which had suffered due to an alleged lack of panache during his Tour wins and his behaviour towards fans and officials. Robert Millar suggested that he specifically rode the way he did in 1986 to win over the French public. Friction between LeMond and Hinault continued into the Coors Classic later in the year, the last stage race of Hinault&#x27;s career. When LeMond attacked during a stage to move up from third to second place overall, Hinault accused him of riding against him, who was in the lead. LeMond countered, assuring him of his assistance and adding: &quot;That&#x27;s a promise, which is something that you can&#x27;t keep.&quot;

Hinault, as he had announced previously, retired at the end of the season, on his 32nd birthday. LeMond meanwhile was unable to defend his Tour title, suffering a near-fatal hunting accident on Easter 1987. He returned to the Tour in 1989, winning the event for a second time and adding a third victory in 1990.

The rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was the subject of the documentary &quot;Slaying the Badger&quot;, part of ESPN&#x27;s series &quot;30 for 30&quot;. Based on the book by the same name by journalist Richard Moore, it premiered on 22 July 2014.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==

There were several classifications in the 1986 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist&#x27;s finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. No time bonuses were given at stage finishes, a change from the 1985 edition. Time bonuses were given for the intermediate sprints. Over the first half of the race, each intermediate sprint gave 12, 8, and 4 bonus seconds to the first three riders across the line, while during the second half, 6, 4, and 2 seconds were awarded. There were 94 intermediate sprints over the course of the 1986 Tour, a record number. In the team time trial on stage 2, the real time of the finishing teams was used to calculate the overall classification, taken on the sixth rider of each team to cross the finish line. The time that could be lost was limited at five minutes, however, if a rider did not finish with the rest of his team, his real time was used, even if it exceeded five minutes.

Additionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing in the top 25 on a stage. All stages awarded the same number of points: 25 for the winner, with each subsequent place receiving one fewer point. In this edition, no points were awarded at intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. Eric Vanderaerden was the winner of this classification.

There was also a mountains classification. The Tour organisers categorised some climbs as either &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Climbs rated &quot;hors catégorie&quot; gave 40 points to the first rider across, down to one point for the 15th rider to reach the summit. First-category climbs awarded 30 points, second category ones 20 for the first rider. Third- and fourth-category mountains awarded 7 and 4 points respectively to the first man across. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots. Bernard Hinault won the mountains prize.

There was also a combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications; its leader wore the combination jersey. Being in first place in the general, points, mountains, or intermediate sprints classification awarded 25 points, down to one point for 25th place. For the second consecutive year, Greg LeMond was the winner of this classification.

Another classification was the debutant classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey. 79 out of the 210 starters were eligible. Andrew Hampsten was the first-placed rider in this classification.

The sixth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but points were only awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey. Gerrit Solleveld () won this classification.

For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps. won the team classification, while won the team points classification.

In addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each mass-start stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. At the conclusion of the Tour, Bernard Hinault won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 18. This prize was won by Luis Herrera. Other minor prizes given included one for the best teammate, won by Bruno Leali (). An award for the &quot;most amiable&quot; rider was given to Ruiz Cabestany. Zoetemelk received a prize for fairplay. There was also a fairplay award given after every stage, and the winners were allowed to wear special socks during the next stage, showing the logo of Paris&#x27; eventually unsuccessful bid to host the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Between 1977 and 1985, a system of &quot;flying stages&quot; had been used. This included a finish line at the middle part of the stage, with the first rider across awarded the same bonuses and prizes as regular stage winners. However, due to a lack of public acceptance for the concept, it was scrapped for the 1986 edition.

==Super Prestige Pernod ranking==
Riders in the Tour competed individually for points that contributed towards the Super Prestige Pernod ranking, an international season-long road cycling competition, with the winner seen as the best all-round rider. The 250 points accrued by Greg LeMond moved him from fourth to the top of the ranking, replacing Sean Kelly, who did not ride the Tour.

==Doping==
No rider tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during the 1986 Tour. Had a positive test occurred, the penalty would have been a ten-minute time penalty for the general classification and a demotion to last place on the stage. In his book &quot;Rough Ride&quot;, rider Paul Kimmage () revealed that during the final stage into Paris, he witnessed riders injecting substances with needles, telling him that they were not afraid to get caught, since only the stage winner and top finishers were tested. In a television interview in late 1999, Peter Winnen () revealed that he had used testosterone to help him get through the Tour in 1986.

<text>A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica is a two-part documentary about the process of making the &quot;Metallica&quot; album (or &quot;The Black Album&quot;) and the following tour. It was produced by Juliana Roberts and directed by Adam Dubin.

&quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot; was released as a double VHS pack. Both parts are available on a single DVD, but only in region 1.

== Part 1 ==
This 90-minute video shows how Metallica and their producer Bob Rock worked their way through making the &quot;Metallica&quot; album. It also includes the making of the video for &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and also a listening party for invited fans to come and listen to the album in full. The video as well highlights tensions between Bob Rock and Metallica. The infamous exchange between Kirk Hammett and Bob Rock during the recording of &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; guitar solo is documented.

This video also includes three of the music videos the band shot for that album:
* &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;
* &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;
* &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;

== Part 2 ==
The second part runs approximately two-and-a-half hours and follows Metallica at the start of their Wherever We May Roam Tour in Europe through to the Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour of 1992. Included are performances of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; from Donington on August 17, 1991, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; from the MTV Video Music Awards on September 5, &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; from Moscow on September 28, &quot;Sad but True&quot; from the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California on October 12, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on April 20, 1992, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; from Phoenix on August 25.

Jason Newsted after a concert in Portland, Maine, is seen making sandwiches to take back to a hotel with him. His response to being called a cheapskate is &quot;I got plans for those millions and it ain&#x27;t for fucking sandwiches!&quot;

Sebastian Bach is seen joking with Slash and Lars Ulrich in Metallica&#x27;s dressing room at RFK Stadium in Washington DC prior to the opening concert of the joint tour with Guns N&#x27; Roses. Bach humorously imitates MTV host Riki Rachtman, and former Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine.

The band also encounter Spinal Tap, who jokingly ask them about the similarities between their album&#x27;s covers.

This part of the documentary also includes two music videos:
* &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;
* &quot;Sad but True&quot;

<text>Peace in Our Time is the fourth studio album by the Scottish band Big Country, released in 1988.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote, &quot;Big Country took a surprising detour on the deliriously overproduced &quot;Peace in Our Time&quot;, which submerges its trademark sound in sanitized, synthesized musical settings ... [the] drastic recast feels like commercial desperation rather than artistic restlessness.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the album displays &quot;a more gentle and subtle style and a crisper, more delicate sound&quot;.

==Track listing==

<doc id="1063043" wikidata="Q1140141" url="?curid=1063043" title="Cris Carter">
<text>Graduel Christopher Darwin Carter (born November 25, 1965) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987–1989), the Minnesota Vikings (1990–2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time.

Carter played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and was selected by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman&#x27;s famous quotes about Carter: &quot;All he does is catch touchdowns.&quot; He was let go by Ryan in 1989, however, due to off-the-field issues. Carter was signed by the Vikings and turned his life and career around, becoming a two-time first-team and one-time second-team All-Pro and playing in eight consecutive Pro Bowls. When he left the Vikings after 2001, he held most of the team career receiving records. He briefly played for the Dolphins in 2002 before retiring.

Since retiring from the NFL, Carter has worked on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NFL,&quot; ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;, and online at Yahoo Sports. He also works as an assistant coach at St. Thomas Aquinas High School, where his son played wide receiver. In 2017, Carter began co-hosting &quot;First Things First&quot; with Nick Wright on FS1. He was terminated from the show following a suspension and investigation in 2019. Carter resides in Boca Raton, Florida. He is the brother of former NBA player and coach Butch Carter.

After six years, and five finalist selections, Carter was voted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 2, 2013.

==Early life==
Carter was born in Troy, Ohio. For elementary school he went to Heywood Elementary in Troy, Ohio. He spent his early childhood there before moving to Middletown, Ohio, with his mother, three brothers, and two sisters. They lived in a small four-bedroom apartment. He attended Middletown High School and starred in both football and basketball.

Named after his grandfather, Graduel, Carter dropped his birth name and unofficially changed his name to Cris after wide receiver Cris Collinsworth (whom he idolized), stating that he would never be famous with the name Graduel. According to Carter on ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;Mike &amp; Mike&quot; (on September 15, 2014), he dropped the name during 7th grade, and his name is still listed as Christopher on official documents, including his driver&#x27;s license.

==College career==
Carter was heavily recruited out of high school for both basketball and football. He accepted the offer to attend Ohio State University from Buckeyes head coach Earle Bruce. Carter became a consensus All-American selection after his junior season, Ohio State&#x27;s first All American at wide receiver.

Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards. In his junior season, he caught 69 passes for 1,127 yards and 11 touchdowns.

Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines. At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: &quot;When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds. Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds. When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.&quot;

Prior to Carter&#x27;s senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters. When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6–4–1 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1–2, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year.

Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions (168), gaining 2,725 yards and 27 touchdowns from them. In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

===Philadelphia Eagles===
A fourth round pick by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1987 supplemental draft, Carter saw limited action during his rookie season catching just 5 passes for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns. His first professional catch was a 22-yard touchdown vs. the St. Louis Cardinals.
Carter got more involved in the Eagles offense in 1988 catching 39 passes for 761 yards and tying for the team lead with 6 scoring receptions. In 1989, he became the teams&#x27; primary red zone receiver, leading the Eagles with 11 touchdown catches (3rd in the NFC) while hauling in 45 passes for 605 yards.
Shortly after, Carter had a falling out with coach Buddy Ryan and was a surprise cut following the pre-season. Carter later admitted that Ryan released him because of alcohol and drug abuse, including large amounts of ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana, and credits his former coach with helping him turn his life around as a result.

===Minnesota Vikings===
The Minnesota Vikings claimed the troubled wide receiver off waivers on September 4, 1990, for only $100. Stuck behind Hassan Jones and resident star receiver, Anthony Carter (no relation), Carter didn&#x27;t see very many passes come his way during his first season in Minnesota. He did gain a measure of revenge against his former team, however, catching six passes for 151 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown, in a &quot;Monday Night&quot; contest at Philadelphia on October 15. Carter finished the 1990 campaign with 27 receptions for 413 yards and 3 touchdowns.

In 1991, Carter stepped forward as Minnesota&#x27;s top pass catcher. He led the team with 72 receptions, 962 yards, and 5 touchdown catches. The winds of change were blowing in Minnesota; after a second straight disappointing season head coach Jerry Burns retired. Stanford head coach Dennis Green was named as his replacement on January 10, 1992, and began a house cleaning process. &quot;The New Sheriff in Town&quot; released stalwarts like RB Herschel Walker and QB Wade Wilson and traded DT Keith Millard to the Seattle Seahawks.

The Vikings returned to NFL prominence in 1992, posting an 11–5 record and capturing their first NFC Central Division title since 1989. With Rich Gannon and Sean Salisbury alternating at QB, Carter remained the team&#x27;s primary aerial weapon—leading the team with 53 receptions, 681 yards, and 6 touchdowns despite missing the final four games of the season with a broken collar bone. The Vikings season ended in disappointment, however, as the defending Super Bowl champions Washington Redskins upended them 24–7 in the Wild Card round.

In 1993, veteran QB Jim McMahon acted as the team&#x27;s primary signal-caller and Carter had a breakout season. He posted career highs in receptions, 86, and yards, 1,071, while catching 9 touchdowns — all team highs, and appeared in his first Pro Bowl. The Vikings finished the season 9–7, good enough for a playoff berth, but fell 17–10 to the New York Giants in the Wild Card round. 
Veteran quarterback Warren Moon was acquired before the 1994 season and immediately developed a rapport with Carter. The veteran helped Carter set the NFL single-season record for receptions with 122 (the record was broken in 1995 by Detroit&#x27;s Herman Moore). Carter also led the team with 1,256 yards and 7 receiving touchdowns, which earned him First-team All Pro honors. Moon and Carter carried the team to a 10–6 record and the NFC Central title, but couldn&#x27;t stop the Vikings from a third straight first-round playoff exit — a 35–18 home loss to the Chicago Bears.

Carter teamed up with Moon in 1995 to post his finest statistical season. He caught 122 passes for a career-high 1,371 yards and led the NFL with 17 touchdown receptions. Carter received Second-team All Pro honors for his efforts. The Vikings, however, finished 8–8 and missed the playoffs for the first time under Green.

Midway through the 1996 season Brad Johnson took over at QB for the Vikings. Carter didn&#x27;t miss a beat, catching 96 passes for 1,163 yards and 10 touchdowns. The Vikings returned to the playoffs with a 9–7 record, but were routed by the Dallas Cowboys 40–15 in the Wild Card round. Carter appeared in his fourth straight Pro Bowl following the season.

Carter continued to be the focal point of the Vikings&#x27; offense in 1997. He was named to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl, leading the NFL with 13 touchdown receptions while pacing the team with 89 catches and 1069 yards. Even though he had more impressive seasons statistically, 1997 may have been Carter&#x27;s finest hour, as week after week he dazzled with one spectacular catch after another. With Randall Cunningham at QB (he replaced the injured Johnson late in the season) the Vikings finally broke through in the playoffs, defeating the Giants 23–22 in a last-minute miracle comeback. The playoff success was fleeting, however, as the team fell to the San Francisco 49ers 38–22 the following week.
In 1998 the Vikings drafted Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss with 21st pick in the first round. Suddenly, the Vikings possessed the NFL&#x27;s most dangerous weapon. They cruised through the regular season, posting a 15–1 record while scoring a then-league record 556 points. Carter, who made the Pro Bowl for the fifth time, caught 78 passes for 1,011 yards and 12 touchdowns. Led by Moss, Carter, and Miller Lite Player of the Year Randall Cunningham, the Vikings entered the playoffs as heavy favorites to reach the Super Bowl. They easily defeated the Arizona Cardinals 41–21 in the Divisional Round, advancing to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1987. The Vikings entered that game as 13 and a half point favorites over the Atlanta Falcons, but lost in overtime 30–27 to become the biggest favorite to ever lose a home playoff game. Carter later said losing that game was the lone regret of his time in Minnesota, and that he didn&#x27;t even know if he wanted to play anymore afterwards.

The following year, Carter had his finest individual season since 1995— the First-team All Pro caught 90 passes for 1,241 yards and an NFL-best 13 touchdowns. The Vikings easily defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27–10 in the Wild Card round and headed to St. Louis to face the NFL&#x27;s new hottest offense. Minnesota led the eventual Super Bowl champions 17–14 at the half, but a second-half flurry led to a 49–37 Rams win.

Carter finished the decade of the &#x27;90s with 835 receptions, second only to Jerry Rice&#x27;s 860, and was named to the NFL&#x27;s All Decade team.

In 2000, led by Daunte Culpepper, the Vikings won the NFC Central division, and Carter finished the season with 96 receptions, 1,274 yards, 9 touchdowns, and an eighth Pro Bowl. On November 30, Carter became only the second player in NFL history to reach the 1,000 reception plateau when he caught a 4-yard touchdown pass against Detroit.

In 2001, the Vikings floundered with a record of 5–11, their first losing season since 1990. Carter&#x27;s production dipped to its lowest point since 1992 (mostly because of QB Spergon Wynn&#x27;s ineffectiveness in the last three games) — 73 catches, 871 yards, 6 touchdowns — and his streak of eight straight Pro Bowls came to an end. Following the season, the longest-tenured Viking exercised an out clause in his contract that ended his career in Minnesota.

Cris Carter left the Vikings as their all-time leader in, among other things, receptions (1,004), receiving yards (12,383), and touchdowns (110).

===Miami Dolphins===
Carter spent the spring of 2002 looking for a team. Although he talked with the Rams, Browns, and Dolphins, he was unable to complete a deal and joined HBO&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; team as an analyst on May 21. He served in that capacity until October 21 when the Miami Dolphins lured the veteran back onto the playing field to bolster their injury-riddled receiving corps.

The Boca Raton resident started in his first game as a Dolphin at Lambeau Field in Week 9. Carter showed signs of rust, catching just three passes for 31 yards and fumbling once. During the week that followed, he checked into the hospital with a kidney ailment and was sidelined for the next four weeks.

Carter returned in Week 14, but struggled to get back into the Dolphins receiver rotation. In Week 15, however, he caught a one-handed touchdown pass as the Dolphins beat the Raiders 23–17. The following week against the Vikings, however, he made a key drop in the end zone that cost Miami a touchdown. The Dolphins wound up losing that game and then lost to the Patriots the following week, missing the playoffs. Even though he put up respectable numbers for the number of games that he played, he retired after the season.

===Legacy===
At the time of his retirement, Carter&#x27;s 1,101 career receptions and 130 touchdowns as a receiver placed him second in NFL history behind Jerry Rice, although his reception total has since been surpassed by Marvin Harrison, and his touchdown receptions by Randy Moss and Terrell Owens. Carter is one of 14 players in NFL history with 1,000 or more receptions. He was named to the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team. Carter was one of 15 finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2008, but was not elected in a surprise to some commentators. Carter was once again excluded in 2009 and again in 2010 as receivers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown became eligible for the first time, though Brown did not make it. Additionally, Andre Reed was another possible candidate that diminished Carter&#x27;s chance for enshrinement in 2010. In 2011, he also did not make it despite not having a single wide receiver in the class.

NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;NFL&#x27;s Top 10&quot; placed him atop the list of wide receivers with the best hands.

On February 2, 2013, Carter was announced as an inductee into the Hall of Fame Class of 2013 along with Bill Parcells, Larry Allen, Jonathan Ogden, Warren Sapp, Curley Culp, and Dave Robinson.

==After football==
Carter was one of the hosts of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; and also was an NFL Analyst for Yahoo Sports and ESPN. He is also a faculty member and assistant coach at St. Thomas Aquinas High School, where his son played wide receiver in 2008. He is the owner of Cris Carter&#x27;s FAST Program, a sports training center in South Florida and is an ordained minister. He also appeared in the 2005 sports video game NFL Street 2 as a wide receiver for the NFL Gridiron Legends team along with former teammate, safety Joey Browner, and a few other historical NFL legends.

Carter was a speaker at the 2008 NFL rookie symposium and again at the 2009 NFL Rookie Symposium. He also spoke at the 2014 NFL rookie symposium, where he encouraged players to get a fall guy they can trust to take the blame if they get in trouble. The comments were revealed in 2015 in an &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; story about Chris Borland. The NFL took the video of the speech down from its website and released a statement saying in part: &quot;The comment was not representative of the message of the symposium or any other league program...The comment was not repeated in the 2014 AFC session or this year&#x27;s symposium.&quot; Carter apologized on Twitter, saying he realized it was bad advice, and everyone should take responsibility for their own actions. ESPN also released a statement saying Carter&#x27;s comments do not reflect the company&#x27;s views.

Carter was chosen to be a coach for a team in the 2015 Pro Bowl, along with former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin.

In December 2016, Carter was hired by Fox Sports as a football analyst. In May 2017, his role was expanded as it was announced that Carter would co-host a morning show, &quot;First Things First&quot;, on Fox Sports 1 with radio personality Nick Wright and moderator Jenna Wolfe. The show premiered on September 5, 2017. His tenure ended in November 2019 following a suspension.

Since 2021 he has been part of &quot;Good Morning Football&quot; as an analyst.

In fall 2023, Carter joined Florida Atlantic under head coach Tom Herman as a volunteer coach. Following the season he was promoted to executive director of player engagement.

==Personal life==
Carter is a Christian and has two children. His daughter, Monterae works in philanthropy. His son, Duron Carter, played wide receiver at Ohio State in 2009 and Coffeyville Community College in 2010, and played for several Canadian Football League teams. Cris is the younger brother of ex-NBA player and coach Butch Carter.

<text>August Friedrich Pott (14 November 1802 in Nettelrede, Hanover5 July 1887 in Halle) was a German pioneer in linguistics.

== Life ==
Pott was a theology student at the University of Göttingen, where he became interested in philology, philosophy, and history. He became a schoolmaster in Celle, but completed his doctoral dissertation, &quot;De relationibus quae praepositionibus in Linguis denotantur&quot;, in 1827 at Göttingen University. As he was not satisfied giving classes in Celle, he went to the University of Berlin to study with Franz Bopp, an important pioneer in Indo-European linguistics. He became an unsalaried lecturer in general linguistics there in 1830, after having completed his habilitation, and became the professor of general linguistics at the University of Halle in 1833, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was a cofounder of the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft, which aims at promoting research on oriental languages.

== Work ==
Pott lectured mainly on general linguistics, philosophy of language and historical grammatic. Additionally, he offered lectures on Sanskrit, Chinese and hieroglyphs. In his research, he focused on Indo-European languages. He coined the term &quot;Iranian languages&quot;. 
His works, notably &quot;Etymologische Forschungen&quot; (1834–1836), established the modern etymological studies on the basis of the correspondence of sounds occurring in related words in the Indo-European languages. 
The first volume appeared in two volumes, and the second edition (1841–76) was expanded to six volumes. He also published on onomastics, and counting systems.
He is also considered the nineteenth century&#x27;s most important philologist of Romany, the language of the Romani people. Pott&#x27;s growing work on Romani languages motivated Friedrich Christian Diez to publish his work more quickly, so the result was an increase in analysis of Romani languages.

He vehemently criticized politization or mystical interpretation of linguistics (e.g. in &quot;Anti-Kaulen: Oder mystische Vorstellungen vom Ursprung der Völker und Sprachen&quot; 1863) and therefore, rejected Arthur de Gobineau&#x27;s book &quot;Versuch über die Ungleichheit der Menschenrassen&quot; (&#x27;Essay on the inequality of the races&#x27;) as lacking a scientific base.

== Honors ==
He was awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 2nd class, the Pour le Mérite, and the Russian Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov) 1st class. In 1850, he became a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and in 1877, he became a foreign member. He also became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1855, a foreign member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1870, and a foreign member Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1876.

In 1870 he received a combined medal (together with Brockhaus, Fleischer and Rödiger) in occasion of the 25th anniversary of the DMG.

<text>Richard John Barker (born 27 October 1951) is a New Zealand politician. He is a member of the Labour Party, and was a middle-ranking Cabinet minister in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Barker was born in the town of Greymouth, on New Zealand&#x27;s West Coast. He attended Greymouth High School and then the University of Otago. After working as a shop assistant, bartender, storeworker, farmhand, driver, factory worker, and quarrier, he became involved in the trade unions, primarily those relating to the service sector. He eventually became National Secretary of the Service Workers&#x27; Union.

===Member of Parliament===


Barker became a member of the Labour Party in 1973, served for a time as the Industrial Representative on the party&#x27;s National Council and was also junior vice-president of the party. In the lead up to the 1993 election Barker sought the Labour nomination for the normally safe Labour seat of Heretaunga, but lost out to political advisor Heather Simpson. Later in 1993 he won the Labour nomination for the Hastings electorate, defeating Auckland Tamoana Freezing Workers&#x27; Union president Pat Weir. His selection was a surprise as Weir won the floor vote of local members, but the selection panel chose Barker. The Freezing Workers&#x27; Union laid a complaint with the Labour Party&#x27;s head office alleging the panel had been stacked, an assertion rejected by party secretary Tony Timms.

At the 1993 election, he succeeded in winning the Hastings electorate, winning a seat that was previously held by the National Party. Soon after entering parliament he supported Helen Clark in her successful leadership challenge to Mike Moore. He was re-elected in 1996, 1999, and 2002 for the reconfigured seat of Tukituki. In 2005 he lost the seat in what was a large swing against the sitting Labour government in the provincial areas and returned to Parliament as a list MP. In 2008 Barker tried unsuccessfully to regain the seat of Tukituki and for the second time was returned to parliament as a Labour list MP. He stood in one of the safest National seats, Taranaki-King Country, in 2011 and was not high enough on the Labour list to remain an MP.

===Cabinet minister===
In 2002 Labour was re-elected for a second term and Barker was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Customs, Minister for Courts, Associate Minister of Justice, and Associate Minister of Social Services and Employment. During the 2002–2005 term, he was given additional responsibility as Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector and Minister for Small Business.

In 2005, Barker was re-appointed to Cabinet as the Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister for Courts, Minister of Civil Defence and Minister of Veterans&#x27; Affairs. Barker lost his ministerial warrants following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2008 election; however, Barker was appointed by the House of Representatives to the role of Assistant Speaker for the 49th New Zealand Parliament for the session 2008–11.

As a cabinet minister, Barker was entitled to the title of The Honourable and became The Hon. Rick (Richard) Barker which is a title he was granted for the rest of his life after his term of office.

===Post-parliamentary roles===
Barker was elected to the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council in 2013, representing the Hastings constituency. In 2016 he was appointed deputy chair of the council. On 30 June 2021 he was elected chair, holding the role until October 2022.

In June 2018, Barker was appointed chairperson of the West Coast District Health Board by the Minister of Health, David Clark. He was reappointed in December 2019.

==Personal life==
He is married to Patsy and has three children.

<text>Ravenswood School for Girls (often referred to as Ravenswood or Ravo) is an independent, Uniting Church, day and boarding school for Prep to Year 12 girls, situated in Gordon, an Upper North Shore suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Established in 1901 by Mabel Fidler (1871–1960), Ravenswood currently caters for approximately 1100 students from Prep to Year 12, including 20 boarders from Years 10 to 12. The school has been an IB World School since June 2004, and is authorised to offer the IB Diploma Programme.

Ravenswood is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA), the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association, the Alliance of Girls&#x27; Schools Australasia, and is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls&#x27; Schools (AHIGS).

==Awards==
Ravenswood has been named one of Australia’s most innovative schools for the fourth year by The Educator, selected on the 5-Star Innovative Schools 2022 list. Ravenswood was also named on The Educator 5-start Innovative Schools list in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Ravenswood received four Excellence Awards at the 2022 Australian Education Awards: Mrs Anne Johnstone, Principal of Ravenswood, received an Excellence Award for School Principal Of The Year (Non-Government)for her innovative application of Positive Education benefits, improving student and staff wellbeing, academic performance and fostering a collegial culture. Kerrie Besgrove, a Mathematics teacher in the Junior School was also recognised with an Excellence Award for Primary School Teacher Of The Year (Non-Government) for her commitment to student potential and innovative teaching. The School also received an Excellence Award for Boarding School Of the Year and Best Student Wellbeing Program. 

In October, 2022, Principal Mrs Anne Johnstone was awarded the Phyllis Evans Medal by the Teachers’ Guild of NSW at the Teachers’ Guild NSW Awards Dinner on World Teachers’ Day. The prize is awarded each year to recognise a &#x27;distinguished educator of great standing.&#x27; In December, Principal Mrs Anne Johnstone was recognised on the 2022 The Educator Hot List. The List, which is in its eighth consecutive year, recognises educators who represent the cutting edge of educational excellence in Australia.

==History==
Ravenswood was established with eight students on 28 January 1901 by the first Headmistress, Mabel Fidler, as a non-sectarian private day school for girls, with preparatory classes for boys. The first classes took place in a schoolroom erected on the block adjacent to Fidler&#x27;s home, &quot;Ravenswood&quot;, in Henry Street, Gordon. The school remains on this site.

Fidler retired from Ravenswood in 1925, a year after the school was purchased by the Methodist Ladies&#x27; College, Burwood, thus becoming a school of the Methodist Church. Subsequently, the school name was changed to Ravenswood Methodist Ladies&#x27; College. At this time, Ravenswood was the largest non-residential, private secondary school in Sydney, with an enrolment of 180, and was highly regarded for the quality of its teaching and its achievements in sport. Ravenswood became a day and boarding school in 1935, with the enrolment of the first two boarders.

The 1960s saw the introduction of the school anthem, &quot;Kindle the Flame&quot; and a fourth school House, all houses being named by the students after Royal Houses of Britain: Stuart, Tudor, Windsor and York. In 1977, as the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches came together to form the Uniting Church, the school name changed to the current Ravenswood School for Girls. The royal blue and gold uniform was also introduced at this time.
In 2015, the Head Girl of the school used her end-of-term speech to accuse the school of peddling an &quot;unrealistic image of perfection&quot;, and providing some students with more opportunities than others because &quot;schools are being run more and more like businesses, where everything becomes financially motivated, where more value is placed on those who provide good publicity or financial benefits.&quot; She also alleged that the school had attempted to censor her speech by requiring prior copies. Her parents later sued the Uniting Church, which runs the school, because of disciplinary action taken against their younger daughter.

==Campus==

Ravenswood is located on its original site, a single campus in suburban Gordon. The school has progressively expanded since 1901, with the acquisition of new properties and the upgrading of facilities.

The school grounds feature quadrangles and courtyards, a multi-purpose complex with heated swimming pool, gymnasium, a &quot;Strength and Conditioning centre&quot; and an Athletics Field. The Ravenswood Centenary Centre includes a Performing Arts theatre, music centre and exhibition areas. Junior School students are catered for within the Junior School centre with a Resource Centre, playground and play equipment area, adventure playground and Assembly Hall.

== Curriculum ==
In Years 11 and 12, students may choose to take either the Higher School Certificate (HSC) course or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Course (IB).

==Co-curriculum==

===Debating===
Ravenswood has a tradition of debating, and students are offered opportunities to participate at competitive or social levels. Ravenswood competes in three inter-school debating competitions: the Independent Schools Debating Association (ISDA), the Archdale Debating Competition and the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA). Girls may also participate in House debating.

=== Sport ===
Primary School students may partake in competitive sport through the Ravenswood&#x27;s membership of the Independent Primary Schools Association of Australia (IPSHA). These competitions are usually held on Saturday mornings and include sports such as: Softball, Tennis, Netball, Cricket, Hockey, and Soccer. Secondary School students compete against 28 other similar type schools in the Independent Girls&#x27; Schools Sporting Association (IGSSA) competition. These competitions occur on Saturday mornings or in the form of carnivals and include sports such as: Softball, Swimming, Diving, Cricket, Tennis, Hockey, Soccer and Gymnastics. Students who perform well at IPSHA or IGSSA level may be invited to compete in NSW Combined Independent Schools&#x27; (CIS) competitions.

== Community ==
It has been nominated for an &quot;Employer of Choice for Women&quot; classification by the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency (EOWA).

==Ravenswood Australian Women’s Art Prize==

<doc id="1063072" wikidata="Q5231322" url="?curid=1063072" title="David Benson-Pope">
<text>David Henry Benson-Pope (born 1950) is a New Zealand politician. He is a former Member of Parliament for Dunedin South and has been a member of the Dunedin City Council since 2013.

Benson-Pope previously served as a Dunedin city councillor from 1986 to 1999 and returned to local government after his parliamentary and ministerial career was ended by a series of misconduct allegations.

==Early career==
Born in Dunedin and educated at King&#x27;s High School, Benson-Pope received his tertiary education at the University of Otago and at the Christchurch College of Education. While studying education he was president of the Students&#x27; Association at the college, and National President of the Student Teachers&#x27; Association of New Zealand.

Working as a teacher at Bayfield High School, where he taught German and outdoor education for 24 years, he became involved in the teachers&#x27; unions and was first elected to the Dunedin City Council on a Labour Party ticket in October 1986. He was re-elected to the city council four more times and resigned in 1999, when he successfully contested the Dunedin South electorate for the Labour Party.

==Member of Parliament ==

Benson-Pope was selected to succeed Labour&#x27;s deputy leader Michael Cullen as the Dunedin South candidate for the 1999 election when Cullen moved to Hawke&#x27;s Bay. He easily defeated National candidate Russel Keast to retain the seat for Labour. During his first term, Benson-Pope was a member of the Local Government and Environment Committee, Regulations Review Committee and Education and Science Committee.

In 2002, Benson-Pope became his party&#x27;s Senior Whip. He entered Cabinet in 2004, becoming Minister of Fisheries, Minister Responsible for the Law Commission, Associate Minister of Justice, Associate Minister for Education (Schools) and Associate Minister for the Environment. He oversaw the drafting of the legislation for civil unions in New Zealand and gained a reputation as a political &quot;Mr Fixit&quot; and &quot;master of the dark art of politics,&quot; but was also known as &quot;difficult to deal with.&quot;

Despite briefly losing his ministerial positions leading up to the 2005 general election due to allegations of misconduct during his teaching career, Benson-Pope was appointed Minister of Social Development and Employment and Minister for the Environment when that election returned the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand for a third term. He lost those positions in 2007 and served the final year of his parliamentary career on the backbench. His committee assignments in 2007 and 2008 were as a member of the Law and Order Committee and Local Government and Environment Committee.

===Allegations of misconduct as a teacher===

Benson-Pope was temporarily stood down as a cabinet minister in 2005 after allegations from former students about the use of violence in the classroom. The allegations included stuffing a tennis ball in 14-year-old&#x27;s mouth, throwing tennis balls at students to keep them quiet, striking a pupil with the back of his hand making the pupil&#x27;s nose bleed at a school camp, and caning a student hard enough to draw blood. Benson-Pope denied the allegations. Claims that he misled Parliament were not referred to the Privileges Committee by the Speaker and after three weeks Benson-Pope was restored to his portfolios, except for his role as Associate Minister of Education.

Further claims about Benson-Pope&#x27;s conduct as a teacher were revealed the following year. &quot;Investigate&quot; magazine published, in February 2006, allegations that he entered the girls&#x27; dormitory on a school camp to awaken students twice, and that he told them once that they were taking too long to shower after a &quot;mud run.&quot; Benson-Pope denied any impropriety.

===Allegations of misconduct as Minister for the Environment===
Benson-Pope faced further controversy in 2007, which led to the resignation of his ministerial posts and the end of his Parliamentary career.

In July 2007 it emerged that a political advisor in Benson-Pope&#x27;s office (the Labour Party&#x27;s Trade Union Affiliate Vice-President Steve Hurring) made phone calls which led to the sacking of the Ministry for the Environment&#x27;s newly appointed communications manager. The issue revolved around her relationship with the chief press secretary to National&#x27;s parliamentary leader John Key, despite the fact that she had &quot;made a disclosure of her personal connections&quot; during the appointment process. (Under New Zealand&#x27;s State Sector Act 1988, ministers and their staff were prohibited from being involved in employment matters within government departments for which they are responsible. The Act requires the chief executives of those departments &quot;to act independently of Ministers in matters relating to decisions on individual employees.&quot;)

After a week of intense pressure focusing not only on the allegation that his staff had acted improperly, but also that he himself had misled Parliament, the media and Prime Minister Helen Clark about his knowledge and involvement, Benson-Pope offered his resignation from Cabinet at noon on Friday 27 July 2007. Clark accepted the resignation, saying, &quot;The way in which certain issues have been handled this week has led to a loss of credibility and on that basis I have accepted Mr Benson-Pope&#x27;s offer to stand aside&quot;. An editorial commented, &quot;Not for the first time, he and the Government have been embarrassed less for what he has done than for his inability to simply say what he has done.&quot;

Despite subsequent investigations by State Services Commissioner Mark Prebble and former State Services Commissioner Don Hunn found that neither the Minister nor his staff acted in any way inappropriately, Benson-Pope remained a backbencher for the remainder of the parliamentary term. His resignation triggered a significant reshuffle of the Cabinet. Although Clark indicated that Benson-Pope could be returned to Cabinet at a later time, he was not reselected as the Labour Party candidate for his electorate at the 2008 general election (which, in any event, Labour lost), and left Parliament.

==Local government career==
After losing his bid to remain Labour&#x27;s Dunedin South candidate for the 2008 general election, Benson-Pope rejected an invitation to stand for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party and did not stand as an independent candidate.

Returning to Dunedin, Benson-Pope worked as a resource consent manager and sought election to the Dunedin City Council (DCC) in the 2013 local body elections. He stood as an independent candidate and was elected on 12 October 2013. He was re-elected in 2016, 2019 and 2022. He was a senior member of the DCC under mayors Dave Cull and Aaron Hawkins and chaired the council&#x27;s planning and regulatory committee from 2013 until 2022.

During a live-streamed Zoom meeting of the DCC held on 5 May 2020, Benson-Pope was seen in the camera of his computer cleaning his study with a feather duster whilst &quot;pants-less&quot;. Members of the public, councillors and senior managers watched on as the meeting faced technological difficulties. Benson-Pope said he was not wearing pants but was wearing shorts after gardening earlier in the day and stated he was &quot;delighted&quot; that his cameo provided a welcome diversion but &quot;it wasn&#x27;t intentional.&quot;

Benson-Pope was re-elected to the Dunedin City Council for a fourth term during the 2022 Dunedin local elections. He was not given a chair or deputy chair role within the Dunedin City Council by the new Mayor of Dunedin Jules Radich. Benson-Pope and Walker claimed that Radich had offered them committee roles which he knew they would reject. The mayor&#x27;s proposed councillor salaries included an 11.7% pay cut for councillors without leadership roles than the equivalent position received in the previous term. In late October, Benson-Pope supported an unsuccessful motion by Green councillor Marie Laufiso to close the pay gap between councillors assigned deputy chair roles and those without these duties. The motion was defeated by a margin of 11 to 4 votes. In December 2022, the DCC was required to consider a revised remuneration proposal after the Remuneration Authority determined the paycut was unlawful.

In mid December 2022, Benson-Pope voiced opposition to Health New Zealand&#x27;s proposed budgetary cutbacks to operating theatres and facilities in plans for the rebuilt Dunedin Hospital, Dunedin&#x27;s primary hospital. He also campaigned for the Hospital to be rebuilt according to its original specifications. In late January, Benson-Pope filed a motion urging the DCC to contribute NZ$130,400 for a public campaign to support the hospital rebuild project as it was outlined in the final business case. On 31 January, the DCC voted unanimously to support Benson-Pope&#x27;s motion to fight changes to the Dunedin Hospital&#x27;s design.

In May 2024, Benson-Pope and fellow Cr Sophie Barker criticised Mayor Radich for not holding regular statutory chief executive appraisal committee. The last such committee meeting was held on 8 September 2023. Benson-Pope claimed that Radich&#x27;s failure to hold regular meetings &quot;was symptomatic of him having none of the skills required to perform this role.&quot; Radich disputed Benson-Pope and Barkers&#x27; criticisms, saying that Benson-Pope was not a member of the appraisal committee and argued that the DCC had held regular meetings.

In late May 2024, Benson-Pope voted in favour of a DCC motion asking the New Zealand government to establish a special visa category for Palestinian refugees displaced by the Israel-Hamas war. He said that &quot;what&#x27;s different here is we&#x27;ve got local residents asking us to get their families out of a hellish situation. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t support that doesn&#x27;t deserve to be sitting here.&quot;

In late September 2024, Benson-Pope voted in favour of the DCC retaining ownership of utility company Aurora Energy following strong public opposition to the proposed sale. He said &quot;&quot;I think, especially for those of you in the room today, that you will already have realised that had that public voice not been so clearly articulated, the decision would have been very, very different.&quot;

==Personal life==
Benson-Pope is married with twin children.

<text>Adventures in Odyssey (AIO), or simply Odyssey, is an Evangelical Christian radio drama and comedy series created and produced by Focus on the Family. Aimed at families with children age 12 and younger, the series first aired in 1987 as a 13-episode pilot called &quot;Family Portraits&quot; and has recorded 1000 episodes to date. In 2005, the show&#x27;s daily audience averaged around 1.2 million within North America. The &quot;Odyssey&quot; radio series also includes several spin-off items, including a home-video series, several computer games, books, and devotionals. The series is set in the fictional town of Odyssey. Stories center around the people who live there, particularly ice-cream and discovery emporium owner John Avery Whittaker, who was originally voiced by Hal Smith.

==History==
In 1982, Focus on the Family began creating several short dramas for inclusion in the ministry&#x27;s daily half-hour radio show; these radio dramas were commissioned by Focus on the Family founder and then-president James Dobson as an alternative to Saturday-morning cartoons. This effort culminated in a thirteen-week test series titled &quot;Family Portraits&quot; which aired in early 1987. It was created by Steve Harris and Phil Lollar, who set it in a small Midwest town they called Odyssey. The test episodes engendered a favorable audience response, and led to a continuing radio program in November 1987, called &quot;Odyssey USA&quot;. The title was later changed in 1988 to &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; to &quot;increase international appeal&quot;.

The goal of the Odyssey staff was to create a &quot;values-based&quot; radio show with production values comparable with or surpassing those of most mainstream audio dramas. While the show aimed to promote Christian values, according to Odyssey&#x27;s co-creator Phil Lollar, the goal is not to be &quot;a preaching program&quot;, but to be an &quot;entertaining program&quot;. Large amounts of work were put into each individual story; for the first few years, each thirty-minute episode typically took over one hundred hours to produce.

Several well-known voice actors were brought in to provide the lead roles. Hal Smith voiced the lead character John Avery Whittaker in one of his favorite roles. The rest of the original &quot;key&quot; characters were voiced by Katie Leigh, Will Ryan, and Walker Edmiston, who, along with Hal Smith, had all previously worked together extensively at Disney. Television star Dave Madden played the character &quot;Bernard Walton&quot; from 1990 to 2008.

When Hal Smith died in 1994, &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; was left without its main character and Focus on the Family considered canceling the radio show. After a search that lasted over two years, a replacement voice was finally found in Paul Herlinger, who sounded very similar to Hal Smith. Herlinger voiced Whittaker from 1996 through 2008. Because of health issues, a mutual decision was made by Herlinger and the crew to replace Herlinger with another voice actor.

Consequently, &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; took a long hiatus, with no new episodes planned while the staff searched for a new actor to voice Mr. Whittaker. In September 2009, Andre Stojka was selected as the third actor to voice Mr. Whittaker; only months later, on February 2, 2010, Paul Herlinger died from his illness. In March 2010, regular episodes resumed airing as Album 51, &quot;Take it from the Top&quot;, premiered.

As of 2022, Chris Anthony and Katie Leigh are the only original cast members remaining in the series.

The show has been adapted into Spanish audio and Hindi live-action videos, with plans to create Mandarin audio as well.
On January 2, 2014, a subscription service for &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; fans and their families launched, the &quot;Adventures In Odyssey Club&quot;. The subscription fee supports &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; as well as other world relief and ministry organizations. The &quot;Adventures In Odyssey Club&quot; is available internationally and had over 7,000 members in 2016. Main features of the club include access to over 900 Episodes from the Radio Series, as well as all 17 videos, every Official Podcast, and exclusive monthly episodes available only to club members.

===Popularity===
By the end of its second year in 1988, the show was on 634 radio stations in North America. As of 1995, it was the second-most popular Christian radio show in the United States. By 2002, the show was on over 6,000 stations worldwide.

Almost all the radio episodes have also been widely released on both cassette and CD collections, and by 1992, almost a million cassettes had been sold. &quot;Odyssey&quot; episodes have also been released annually (since 1990) as promotional items through Chick-fil-A. Several times, Chick-fil-A has had special CD sets as their &quot;kids&#x27; meal&quot; product.

<text>Rocawear (stylized Roc-A-Wear) is an American clothing brand founded in 1999 by Roc-A-Fella Records co-founders Damon Dash and Shawn &quot;Jay-Z&quot; Carter. The brand has had annual sales of $700 million. Rocawear expanded through licensing to sell affordable clothes for children and juniors; socks and sandals; leather, suede, and fur outerwear; handbags and belts; lounge wear; big and tall; headwear; jewelry; and sunglasses; as well as co-branded product with Pro-Keds, State Property, and Team Roc.

R&amp;B singer Ciara signed to be the new face of Rocawear in 2007 for the &#x27;I Will Not Lose&#x27; campaign. Chris Brown, Memphis rap collective Three 6 Mafia, radio personality Ebro Darden, Toccara and Rich Boy were amongst the other celebrities who were part of the campaign.

In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. Jay-Z retained his stake in the company and continued to oversee the marketing, licensing, and product development. In May 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought out Jay-Z&#x27;s testimony in relation to possible security law violations made by Iconix.

In March 2009, Rocawear launched its first social networking site, offering style news, music, fashion, and cultural connections.

In August 2011, Jay-Z confirmed via Twitter that Rocawear had partnered with Pharrell Williams&#x27; clothing label, Billionaire Boys Club.

In 2012, Rocawear was a €490 million clothing business.

In November 2018, Jay-Z successfully halted a $204 million lawsuit between Roc Nation and Iconix over the lack of black arbitrators in the US.

<text>The Communist Youth of Greece (; ) is the youth organization of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). It is a Marxist-Leninist organization which mainly seeks to familiarize the Greek youth with the policies of the KKE.

It publishes the monthly magazine &quot;Odigitis&quot; (Greek: Οδηγητής, &quot;guider&quot;) which operates as the Organ of the Central Council of KNE and hosts Odigitis festivals in most of the major towns and cities of Greece.

KNE is a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

== History ==
KNE was founded on 15 September 1968, with a decision of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the KKE, during the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, as an organization of youth with revolutionary and communist features.

It is the historical continuation of OKNE (Federation of Communist Youth Organizations of Greece), of all the organizations of youth which had already taken part in people&#x27;s struggle in Greece, such as EPON (United Panhellenic Organization of Youth), DNE (Democratic Youth of Greece), D.N.Lampraki (Democratic Youth &quot;Lamprakis&quot;).

In 1989-1991, a deep crisis shocked KNE and the KKE. In autumn 1989, disagreeing with the participation of the KKE in the Tzannetakis and Zolotas national unity governments, a large group, including the major part of KNE under its secretary-general , from the KKE and formed the New Left Current (NAR). The KKE, then part of the Synaspismos coalition, attempted to dissolve KNE into the Synaspismos Youth League. Later in 1991, the KKE left the coalition, purged all non-hardliners (incl. 45% of the central committee and KKE secretary-general ), and restored KNE with the efforts of some hundreds of members. In March 1993, the 6th Congress of the Organization took place.

In the late 2000s, KNE decided to constitute MAS (Front of Students&#x27; Struggle) ( ) which was finally founded by students&#x27; organizations in Athens, 6 November 2009.

<doc id="1063090" wikidata="Q1351191" url="?curid=1063090" title="Richard Flanagan">
<text>Richard Miller Flanagan (born 1961) is an Australian writer, who won the 2014 Man Booker Prize for his novel &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; and the 2024 Baillie Gifford Prize for &quot;Question 7&quot;, making him the first writer in history to win both Britain&#x27;s major fiction and non-fiction prizes.

Flanagan was described by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; as &quot;one of our greatest living novelists&quot;.

&quot;[C]onsidered by many to be the finest Australian novelist of his generation&quot;, according to &quot;The Economist, the New York Review of Books&quot; described Flanagan as &quot;among the most versatile writers in the English language&quot;.

He has also worked as a film director and screenwriter.

==Early life and education==
Flanagan was born in Longford, Tasmania, in 1961, the fifth of six children. He is descended from Irish convicts transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land during the Great Famine in Ireland. Flanagan&#x27;s father was a survivor of the Burma Death Railway and one of his three brothers is Australian rules football journalist Martin Flanagan.

Flanagan was born with severe hearing loss, which was corrected when he was six years old. He grew up in the remote mining town of Rosebery on Tasmania&#x27;s western coast.

Flanagan left school at the age of 16 but returned to study at the University of Tasmania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with First-Class Honours. Flanagan was president of the Tasmania University Union in 1983. The following year, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Worcester College, Oxford, where he earned the degree of Master of Letters in History.

==Early works==
Flanagan wrote four non-fiction works before moving to fiction, works that he called &quot;his apprenticeship&quot;. One of these was &quot;Codename Iago&quot;, an autobiography of Australian con man John Friedrich, which Flanagan ghostwrote in six weeks to make money to write his first novel. Friedrich killed himself in the middle of the book&#x27;s writing and it was published posthumously. Simon Caterson, writing in &quot;The Australian&quot;, described it as &quot;one of the least reliable but most fascinating memoirs in the annals of Australian publishing&quot;.

==Novels==

Flanagan&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Death of a River Guide&quot; (1994), is the tale of Aljaz Cosini, a river guide, who lies drowning, reliving his life and the lives of his family and forebears. It was described by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; as &quot;one of the most auspicious debuts in Australian writing&quot;. &quot;The Sound of One Hand Clapping&quot; (1997), tells the story of Slovenian immigrants and was a major bestseller, selling more than 150,000 copies in Australia. Flanagan&#x27;s first two novels, declared &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, &quot;rank with the finest fiction out of Australia since the heyday of Patrick White&quot;.

&quot;Gould&#x27;s Book of Fish&quot; (2001) is based on the life of William Buelow Gould, a convict artist, and tells the tale of his love affair with a young black woman in 1828. It won the 2002 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. Flanagan described these early novels as &#x27;soul histories&#x27;. &quot;The Unknown Terrorist&quot; (2006), was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;stunning ... a brilliant meditation upon the post-9/11 world&quot;. &quot;Wanting&quot; (2008) tells two parallel stories: about the novelist Charles Dickens in England, and Mathinna, an Aboriginal orphan adopted by Sir John Franklin, the colonial governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, and his wife, Lady Jane Franklin. As well as being a &quot;New Yorker&quot; Book of the Year and &quot; Observer&quot; Book of the Year, it won the Queensland Premier&#x27;s Prize, the Western Australian Premier&#x27;s Prize and the Tasmania Book Prize. &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; (2013), about a Tasmanian doctor who becomes a Japanese prisoner of war, won the 2014 Man Booker Prize.

&quot;First Person&quot; (2017), based loosely on his experience early in his writing career ghost-writing the autobiography of John Friedrich. The &quot;New Yorker&quot; noted &quot;the novel, with its switchbacking recollections and cyclical dialogue, its penetrating scenes of birth and, eventually, death, is enigmatic and mesmerizing&quot; while the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; called it a &quot;tour-de-force&quot;.

&quot;The Living Sea of Waking Dreams&quot; (2020) about a woman caring for her dying mother during Australia&#x27;s Black Summer of climate change induced wildfires, was described in a review for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as &quot;a revelation and a triumph . . . astonishing&quot;.

Robert Dixon&#x27;s (ed.) &quot;Richard Flanagan: Critical Essays&quot; (2018) offers different perspectives on Flanagan&#x27;s writing, while Joyce Carol Oates has written an overview of his novels for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;.

==Non-fiction==
Flanagan has written on literature, the environment, art and politics for the Australian and international press including , &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (London), &quot;Suddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;The Monthly&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;New Yorker&quot;. Some of his writings have proved controversial. &quot;The Selling-out of Tasmania&quot;, published after the death of former premier Jim Bacon in 2004, was critical of the Bacon government&#x27;s relationship with corporate interests in the state. Premier Paul Lennon declared, &quot;Richard Flanagan and his fictions are not welcome in the new Tasmania&quot;.
Flanagan&#x27;s 2007 essay on logging company Gunns, then the biggest hardwood woodchipper in the world, &quot;Gunns. Out of Control&quot; in &quot;The Monthly&quot;, first published as &quot;Paradise Razed&quot; in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (London), inspired Sydney businessman Geoffrey Cousins&#x27; high-profile campaign to stop the building of Gunns&#x27; two billion dollar Bell Bay Pulp Mill. Cousins reprinted 50,000 copies of the essay for letterboxing in the electorates of Australia&#x27;s environment minister and opposition environment spokesperson. Gunns subsequently collapsed with huge debt, its CEO John Gay found guilty of insider trading, and the pulp mill was never built. Flanagan&#x27;s essay won the 2008 John Curtin Prize for Journalism.

A collection of his non-fiction was published as &quot;And What Do You Do, Mr Gable?&quot; (2011).

In 2015 he published &quot;Notes on an Exodus&quot;, on the Syrian refugee crisis, arising out of visiting refugee camps in Lebanon, Greece, and meeting refugees in Serbia. The book also features sketches made by the noted Australian artist Ben Quilty, who travelled with Flanagan to meet the refugees.

His 2021 book &quot;Toxic. The Rotting Underbelly of the Tasmanian Salmon Industry&quot; has been credited with lifting &#x27;the veil on the Atlantic salmon industry&#x27;s environmental and social malfeasances&#x27; and igniting popular opposition to the industry.

In 2024, his book &quot;Question 7,&quot; which had also been long listed for the Prix Medicis and shortlisted for the Prix Femina as a novel, won the GBP 50,000 (AUD 97,000) Baillie Gifford prize for Non-Fiction, making him the first author to win both the Booker and Baillie Gifford prizes. However Flanagan declared that he would not accept the prize money until Baillie Gifford shared with the public a plan showing how they will decrease their investment in fossil fuel extraction and increase their investment in renewable energy.

==Film==
The 1998 film of &quot;The Sound of One Hand Clapping&quot;, written and directed by Flanagan, was nominated for the Golden Bear at that year&#x27;s Berlin Film Festival.

He worked with Baz Luhrmann as a writer on the 2008 film &quot;Australia.&quot;

A major television series of &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot;, directed by Justin Kurzel (&quot;Snowtown&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;The Order&quot;) and starring Jacob Elordi (&quot;Euphoria&quot;, &quot;Priscilla&quot;, &quot;Saltburn&quot;) has been acquired by the BBC for screening on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.

==Personal life==
Flanagan is an ambassador for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, to which he donated his $40,000 prize money on winning the Australian Prime Minister&#x27;s Literary Prize in 2014. A painting of Richard Flanagan by artist Geoffrey Dyer won the 2003 Archibald Prize. A rapid on the Franklin River, Flanagan&#x27;s Surprise, is named after him. He was made an Honorary Citizen of Oxford, Mississippi, the home town of William Faulkner, in 2014. The Tamanian Museum and Art Gallery mounted an exhibition in 2024 of five monumental sculptural pieces by Tasmanian artist, master furniture-maker and wood craftsman, Kevin Perkins, each piece inspired by one of Flanagan&#x27;s novels.

Flanagan lives in Hobart, Tasmania with his Slovenian-born wife Majda (née Smolej) and has three daughters, Rosie, Jean and Eliza.

His life was the subject of a BAFTA award-winning BBC documentary, &quot;Life After Death&quot;.

<doc id="1063091" wikidata="Q355251" url="?curid=1063091" title="Carlo Ginzburg">
<text>Carlo Ginzburg (; born 15 April 1939) is an Italian historian and a proponent of the field of microhistory. He is best known for &quot;Il formaggio e i vermi&quot; (1976, English title: &quot;The Cheese and the Worms&quot;), which examined the beliefs of an Italian heretic, Menocchio, from Montereale Valcellina.

In 1966, he published &quot;The Night Battles&quot;, an examination of the &quot;benandanti&quot; visionary folk tradition found in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Friuli in northeastern Italy. He returned to looking at the visionary traditions of early modern Europe for his 1989 book &quot;Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot;.

== Life ==
The son of Natalia Ginzburg, a novelist, and Leone Ginzburg, a philologist, historian, and literary critic, Carlo Ginzburg was born in 1939 in Turin, Italy. His interest for history was influenced by the works of historians Delio Cantimori and Marc Bloch. He received a PhD from the University of Pisa in 1961. He subsequently held teaching positions at the University of Bologna, the University of California, Los Angeles (1988–2006), and the &quot;Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa&quot;. His fields of interest range from the Italian Renaissance to early modern European history, with contributions to art history, literary studies, and the theory of historiography.

In 1979, Ginzburg formally requested that Pope John Paul II open the Inquisition Archives. While the immediate response of the Vatican has not yet come to light, a limited group of scholars had been granted access by 1991. In January 1998 the archives were formally opened to &quot;qualified researchers.&quot; Cardinal Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) credited Ginzburg, and his 1979 letter, as having been instrumental in the Vatican&#x27;s decision to open these archives. Ginzburg had his doubts about using statistics to reach a judgment about the period. “In many cases, we don’t have the evidence, the evidence has been lost,” said Ginzburg.

Along with Paul Ginsborg, Marcello Flores, Sergio Luzzatto, Claudio Pavone, Enzo Traverso, etc., Ginzburg called, in January 2002, for the rejection of a bill, presented by Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, that would have outlawed Holocaust denial. They argued that Italy&#x27;s legislation was sufficient to cope with such acts. The amended bill finally restricted itself to reinforcing sentences concerning hate speech.

He was awarded the 2010 Balzan Prize and was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2013.

== Work ==

In &quot;The Night Battles&quot; and &quot;Ecstasies&quot;, Ginzburg traced a complex path from certain European witch persecutions to the &quot;benandanti&quot; and a wide variety of practices which he describes as evidence of a substrate of shamanic cults in Europe. His 1999 work, &quot;The Judge and the Historian&quot;, sought to expose injustice in the trial of Adriano Sofri, but failed to win a new trial. His book was not only about Sofri but was also a general reflection on the scientific methods used by a historian, and their similarity to the work of a judge, who also has to correlate testimonies with material evidence in order to deduce what really happened. Thus, he explains how the judicial model of early historiography made it focus on easily verifiable facts, resulting in studies that centred on individuals or on what Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch called in the &quot;Annales d&#x27;histoire économique et sociale&quot; an &quot;evenemential history&quot;. In his book &quot;History, Rhetoric, and Proof&quot; (1999), he contrasts the ancient rhetoric of Aristotle with the modern rhetoric of Nietzsche.

<doc id="1063094" wikidata="Q7044778" url="?curid=1063094" title="No Place Like Home (Big Country album)">
<text>No Place Like Home is the fifth studio album by Scottish band Big Country, released in September 1991. Its title derives from a quote in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, which is referenced by the first track, &quot;We&#x27;re Not in Kansas&quot;. Dorothy&#x27;s statement was in turn taken from the famous poem and song &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; by John Howard Payne and Henry Bishop.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, Simon Dudfield of &quot;NME&quot; noted the band&#x27;s transition from their &quot;straight rock&quot; and &quot;old Scottish growl&quot; to &quot;a more traditional R&amp;B feel&quot;. He concluded, &quot;By returning to a form of music they truly love, Big Country have made a commendable step in the right direction; a bright start to their decade.&quot; Caren Myers of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was critical of the album and concluded there is &quot;no place like the bin&quot;. She described Big Country as a band that &quot;makes Lime Spiders look like The Rolling Stones&quot; and Adamson as a &quot;Celtic Springsteen wannabe&quot;. She felt the album was made up of a &quot;series of insufferable bar-room boogies&quot; and added, &quot;This, we are told, is Big Country getting back to basics, their R&amp;B roots. Naturally, all sentient listeners will wish they wouldn&#x27;t, but who listens to us anyway?&quot;

==Track listing==
&quot;You, Me and the Truth&quot; and &quot;Comes a Time&quot; were bonus tracks on the CD and cassette releases of the album; they were not on the original vinyl release. The 2014 deluxe edition of the album restores the vinyl running order and moves these tracks to a bonus disc.

<doc id="1063096" wikidata="Q7934648" url="?curid=1063096" title="Virginia Vestoff">
<text>Virginia Vestoff (December 9, 1939 – May 2, 1982) was an American actress of film, television and Broadway.

==Early life==
Vestoff was born into a family of vaudeville performers in New York City. Both her Russian immigrant father and mother, who was the great niece of American composer Stephen Foster, died and left Virginia an orphan at the age of nine. She coped with the loss by acting, and took third prize on &quot;The Ted Mack Amateur Hour&quot;, which launched a professional career with the Children&#x27;s Chorus of the New York City Opera.

While living with relatives, Virginia attended the New York High School for the Performing Arts. At 15, she decided to move out and manage life on her own by attending Washington Irving High School and moonlighting as a salesgirl at a department store. However, Virginia quit school early to tour with a dance company. The failure to graduate remained a personal regret to Virginia throughout her life, which she countered with a thirst to self-educate, becoming an extensive reader.

==Professional career==
Soon after dropping out, Vestoff landed a part on stage in &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; and it led to many of her other theatrical credits including &quot;I&#x27;m Getting My Act Together and Taking It On the Road&quot;, &quot;Spokesong&quot;, &quot;Drinks Before Dinner&quot;, &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;, &quot;Love and Let Love&quot;, &quot;Man With a Load of Mischief&quot;, Ben Bagley&#x27;s &quot;New Cole Porter Revue&quot;, &quot;And in this Corner&quot;, &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;The Crystal Heart&quot;, &quot;Private Lives&quot;, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;The Archbishop&#x27;s Ceiling&quot;, &quot;Booth is Back in Town&quot;, &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;Put it in Writing&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

In 1960 she made her first professional appearance in the play &quot;The Crystal Heart&quot; with Mildred Dunnock at the Off-Broadway East 74th Street Theater, with top seats selling for $4.96 ($ in current dollar terms),

Vestoff made her Broadway debut in the 1960 revue &quot;From A to Z&quot;. Her most famous stage role was that of Abigail Adams in &quot;1776&quot;, a role which garnered her a Tony nomination and one she reprised in the film adaptation. Additional Broadway credits include &quot;Irma La Douce&quot;, &quot;Boccaccio&quot;, &quot;Via Galactica&quot;, and &quot;Baker Street&quot;, in which she met her future husband, writer Morty Lefkoe, president and founder of the Lefkoe Institute and creator of the Lefkoe Method, a psychological process.
For a time, Vestoff took on dual duties with Broadway and daytime drama. From October 20, 1969 to June 20, 1970, she played Dr. Althea Davis on &quot;The Doctors&quot;, taking over from a departing Elizabeth Hubbard. When Vestoff left due to her unhappiness with the role, Hubbard returned to the role on October 1, 1970. She eventually joined the cast of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; as Samantha Drew Collins. 
Vestoff also did another soap opera stint on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and appeared in numerous television commercials, including Sure Deodorant, Geritol, Hamburger Helper, Sardo Bath Beads, and Bradlees.

Vestoff&#x27;s primetime television guest credits included &quot;The Quinns&quot;, &quot;Carmody&quot;, &quot;Contact: The Case of the Secret Message&quot;, &quot;We Interrupt This Season&quot;, &quot;Alone at Last&quot; and &quot;Kojak&quot;. Her screen roles included Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;A Wedding&quot; and &quot;Such Good Friends&quot;.

==Death==
Vestoff died of cancer in New York City on May 2, 1982, at age 42.

<doc id="1063098" wikidata="Q1032865" url="?curid=1063098" title="Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex">
<text>The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) is a satellite communication station, part of the Deep Space Network of NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located at Tidbinbilla in the Australian Capital Territory. Opened in 1965, the complex was used for tracking the Apollo Lunar Module, and along with its two sister stations at Goldstone, California and Madrid, Spain is now used for tracking and communicating with NASA&#x27;s spacecraft, particularly interplanetary missions. Its DSS-43 antenna is the only antenna on Earth that can send commands to Voyager 2. It is managed in Australia by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation program (SCaN) at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

==Location==
The complex is located in the Paddys River (a tributary of the Cotter River) valley, about 20 km from Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. The complex is part of the Deep Space Network run by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It is commonly referred to as the Tidbinbilla Deep Space Tracking Station and was officially opened on 19 March 1965 by then Prime Minister of Australia Sir Robert Menzies.

The station is separated from Canberra by the Murrumbidgee River and, more importantly, the Coolamon Ridge, Urambi Hills, and Bullen Range, which help shield the dishes from the city&#x27;s radio frequency (RF) noise. Located nearby is the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.

==Management==
The CSIRO manages most of NASA&#x27;s activities in Australia.

In February 2010 CSIRO took over direct management of the site with the establishment of CASS (CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science). Previous to this CDSCC had been managed by external sub-contractor organisations, such as Raytheon Australia from 2003–2010; BAE Systems (formerly British Aerospace Australia) 1990–2003; AWA Electronic Services -1990.

== History ==
During the mid 1960s NASA built three tracking stations in the Australian Capital Territory.
*The Tidbinbilla Tracking Station (now known as CDSCC) was opened in 1965 and is the only NASA tracking station in Australia still in operation. During the Apollo program, Tidbinbilla was used for tracking the Apollo Lunar Module.
*The Orroral Valley Tracking Station () was opened in May 1965 in what is now part of Namadgi National Park. Its role was orbiting satellite support, although it also supported the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. It was closed in 1985.
*Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station () opened in 1967 and was built primarily to support the Apollo Moon missions, mainly communications with the Apollo Command Module. After the cancellation of the Apollo Project the station supported Skylab until its re-entry in 1979 when the station joined the Deep Space Network in support of the Viking and Voyager projects. 1981 saw the closure of the station and its 26 m antenna was moved to CDSCC to become known as Deep Space Station 46. After the antenna was removed the rest of the facility was dismantled and knocked down. Its foundation, access road and parking area are all that remains of the facility.
== Antennas ==
As of late 2016 the station has five large antennas, called Deep Space Stations (DSS), each identified by a number: DSS-34, DSS-35, DSS-36, DSS-43, and DSS-45. The CDSCC also uses the Parkes radio telescope in central New South Wales at busy times to receive data from spacecraft (then designated DSS-49). There has been ongoing construction since 2010 building additional 34 m beam waveguide antenna. Construction of DSS-35 began in July 2010. The station&#x27;s collimation tower is located approximately 3 km to the north-west, on Black Hill.

==Funding==
CDSCC costs about per year to run, and is funded by NASA.

<text>Richard Mark Burton (born 16 January 1956) is a New Zealand politician. He is a member of the Labour Party, having served as Minister of Defence, Minister of Justice, Minister of Local Government, Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Deputy Leader of the House, and the Minister Responsible for the Law Commission in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand.

==Early life==
Burton was born in Northampton, England, but was brought to New Zealand by his family when ten years old. He attended high school in Wanganui, attending Wanganui Boys College and was in the year group ahead of future National MP Michael Laws. He has been involved in a wide range of social and community organisations, including the Red Cross, the Department of Social Welfare, the Central Plateau Rural Education Activities Programme, the Council of Social Services, the Taupō Employment Support Trust, and the Taupō Sexual Abuse Counselling Service. He received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal for his work.

==Member of Parliament==



In the 1993 election, Burton stood as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for Tongariro, an electorate in the central North Island, defeating Ian Peters. This later became the seat of Taupō, which Burton retained.

From 1996 to 1999, he served as his party&#x27;s Senior Whip.

===Cabinet minister===
When the Labour Party won power in the 1999 election, Burton became part of the new Cabinet, assuming the roles of Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Defence, Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, Minister of Tourism, and Minister of Veterans&#x27; Affairs. In 2002, Internal Affairs and Veterans&#x27; Affairs were transferred to George Hawkins. In February 2005 he became the Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, and dropped the State-Owned Enterprises portfolio.

In late 2004, with Jonathan Hunt set to retire from politics, Burton was regarded by many as the Labour Party&#x27;s preferred choice to replace him as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In the end, however, Labour decided to nominate Margaret Wilson for the position.

Burton sponsored the introduction of the Electoral Finance Act, which made election funding more transparent and open by making anonymous donations illegal if they exceed the sum of $12,000. The Act capped the highest donation to the sum of $120,000 and increased public funding in elections to allow for more funding to go to a wider range of parties. The Act extended the regulated period classifying an election year to 1 January of the election year.

In November 2007 Burton resigned from his Cabinet positions during Prime Minister Helen Clark&#x27;s portfolio renewal. When Labour&#x27;s party list was written prior to the 2008 general election, he was given a low placing of 39. He then lost his seat in a nationwide swing to the National Party, and due to his place on the list, was not returned to parliament.

Burton stood unsuccessfully for Taupō District Mayor in the 2010 local body elections. After Darren Hughes resigned his list seat in 2011, and the next person on the Labour Party list, Judith Tizard, declined to take it up, Burton was entitled to reenter Parliament for the remainder of the term. However, he also declined the offer.

<doc id="1063107" wikidata="Q5414497" url="?curid=1063107" title="Thomas Rongen">
<text>Thomas Eddy Rongen (born 31 October 1956) is a Dutch-American football coach who has spent the majority of his playing and coaching career in the United States. In December 2016, he was named Chief Scout of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. Rongen won the MLS Coach of the Year award in MLS&#x27;s inaugural season in 1996, leading the Tampa Bay Mutiny to the best regular-season record. His stint managing the American Samoa national team was covered in the 2014 documentary &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot;, and the 2023 biographical comedy-drama also called &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot;.

== Playing career ==
Rongen began his playing career with Amsterdamsche FC, with whom he played as defensive midfielder and defender from 1973 to 1979.

In 1979, Rongen moved to the United States, joining the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League. Rongen spent the entire 1979 season with the Aztecs. He then began the 1980 season in Los Angeles. On 12 July 1980, the Aztecs sold his contract to the Washington Diplomats. The team folded at the end of the season and Rongen moved to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers where he would remain for the next three seasons. In 1984, Joe Robbie, owner of the Strikers, moved the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota where it was renamed the Minnesota Strikers. Rongen moved with the team and spent the 1984 outdoor season there. The league collapsed at the end of the season.

The Strikers moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League for the 1984–1985 season. On 22 May 1985, Rongen joined the South Florida Sun of the United Soccer League. The league lasted six games, then collapsed. In October 1985, Rongen signed as a free agent with the Chicago Sting of MISL. At the end of the season, he moved to Florida to coach youth and high school soccer. In 1987, he played for the Houston Dynamos of the Lone Star Soccer Alliance. On 8 January 1988, he became the first player to sign with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the newly established American Soccer League. He continued to play for the Strikers until 1993.

== Coaching career ==
Rongen began his coaching career as an assistant with the Pope John Paul II High School boys&#x27; team in 1984. On 27 June 1986, he was named as head coach. During his tenure coaching PJPII, he took the team to a 32–6–5 record and he was a two time &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; Coach of the Year. He resigned from his position on 16 May 1988. He also coached with the Plantation Eagles Soccer Club. This led to his selection as coach of the Florida U-23 soccer team which defeated the United States national team with goals from Zen Luzniak and Henry Gutierrez in an 8 March 1987 scrimmage. Rongen also served as an assistant with the Nova Southeastern University men&#x27;s soccer team. In August 1988, he was hired to coach the South Plantation High School boys&#x27; team.

On 8 February 1989, he replaced Wim Suurbier as head coach of the Strikers. He took the Strikers to the 1989 ASL title and then skippered the team to a victory over the San Diego Nomads in the national championship game. He was the 1990 APSL Coach of the Year. In August 1994, he resigned as head coach. In November 1990, he replaced Hal Henderson as head coach of Nova Southeastern University. He coached the team for five seasons, compiling a 50–35–8 record.

=== Major League Soccer ===

====Tampa Bay Mutiny====

Rongen was one of the inaugural coaches in MLS, coaching the Tampa Bay Mutiny in their first season in 1996, with whom he won the MLS regular season (and what would retrospectively become the Supporters&#x27; Shield), and also won MLS Coach of the Year Award.

====New England Revolution====

On November 5, 1996 the New England Revolution traded their first-round pick in the 1997 MLS College Draft to the Tampa Bay Mutiny in exchange for the right to hire Rongen as their new head coach. Rongen coached the Revolution to their first-ever playoff appearance in the 1997 season, but was unable to replicate the success he had in Tampa Bay. When asked about his struggles in New England, Rongen referenced &quot;cancers&quot; in the locker room that undermined team performance in 1998, and stated &quot;a lot of things happened behind the scenes that I didn&#x27;t know about until it was too late,&quot; adding that &quot;there were different factions where players didn&#x27;t know who to trust anymore.

Ultimately Rongen announced his resignation on August 24, 1998, following an 8-18 campaign in his second and final year in New England. In 58 matches in charge, Rongen led the Revolution to a 23-35 record.

====D.C. United====

Following his two year stint with the Revolution, Rongen succeeded Bruce Arena as the head coach of D.C. United, which he led to the Supporters&#x27; Shield and MLS Cup titles in 1999. He was a finalist for 1999 MLS Coach of the Year, but lost out to Sigi Schmid.
Rongen&#x27;s D.C. United missed the playoffs in both 2000 and 2001, and he lost his job with United in 2001, and was replaced with Ray Hudson.

=== National teams ===
Upon leaving United, Rongen was appointed head coach of the United States men&#x27;s U20 national team, which he coached from 2001 to his appointment as head coach of Chivas USA for the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 2005. However, ten games into the season, with the team&#x27;s record standing at one win, one tie, and eight losses, he was let go of his head coaching duties.

Rongen was appointed head coach of the United States men&#x27;s U20 national team again in 2006 and led the team to the 2007 and 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cups. He was fired from that position in May 2011 after the team failed to qualify for the 2011 U-20 World Cup.

=== American Samoa rebirth ===
In 2011, Rongen became the head coach of American Samoa. With Rongen at the helm, and after three weeks training them both physically and inspirationally, American Samoa registered its second ever victory on 22 November 2011, against Tonga, in the 2014 World Cup qualification. Under Rongen, American Samoa reached 173rd in the FIFA World Rankings. His work with the American Samoa team is at the center of the 2014 British documentary, &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot; and the Taika Waititi directed film of the same name, starring Michael Fassbender as Rongen.

=== MLS and NASL ===
Rongen became director of TFC Academy prior to the 2012 season, joining countrymen Aron Winter and Bob de Klerk at Toronto FC.

He was named head coach of the Tampa Bay Rowdies in December 2014. Rongen was fired along with General Manager and President, Farrukh Quraishi on 21 August 2015.

In late 2016, Rongen was hired by Bruce Arena as the head international scout for the United States national team program.

== Commentator jobs ==
Currently he is a sports commentator for CBS Sports and beIN Sports.

== Personal life ==
Rongen married Gail Megaloudis in 1996. He is stepfather to Gail&#x27;s children with Nicky Megaloudis, Nicole and Chris. In 2004, Nicole died in a single car accident on I-64 West in Goochland County, Virginia, aged 19. Rongen wore his stepdaughter&#x27;s baseball cap during American Samoa&#x27;s win over Tonga, as shown in &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot;.

<text>Antonio Amador José de Nariño y Álvarez del Casal (April 9, 1765 – December 13, 1823), was a Colombian ideological of the independence movement in New Granada (present day Colombia) as well as one of its early political and military leaders. In 1793 he published the first French to Spanish translation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in Spain&#x27;s American colonies.

Born to an artistocratic family in 1765 in Santafe de Bogota, from his youth, Nariño was involved in political activities that he knew how to combine with financial and commercial activities that led him to accumulate a fortune. His foray into politics would see him become mayor of the second vote elected by the council of Santafe in 1789, as well as interim treasurer of tithes of the archbishopric, appointed in July of the same year.

His fortune allowed him to import his own printing press, which allowed him to create the Patriotic Press (Imprenta Patriotica) where he began to publish and distribute clandestinely various texts amongst his literary circle of which many prominent creoles of Santafe were a part of. In 1793 after having acquired a French copy of the &quot;History of the Revolution of 1789,&quot; Narino translated the portion of the text that contained the Declarations of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from French to Spanish and distributed it among his circle. This event would see his arrest along with other members of his literary society by Spanish authorities.

Between the time of his arrest in his house in Santa Fe, in August 1794 and his release in Cartagena in June 1810, for a period of almost sixteen years, Nariño was imprisoned except for the interval he spent hidden in Europe and America between the moment of his escape to Cádiz (March 17, 1796) and his voluntary surrender in Santa Fe (July 19, 1797).

After his release in Cartagena in June 1810, Nariño returned to Santa Fe in time to collaborate in the organization of the first Neogranadine congress of which he was appointed secretary at the beginning of sessions in December 1810. However, as time passed the unity between the delegates of the various provinces of New Granada would crumble as the argument between Federalism and Centralism arose, Nariño was a staunch centralist and vehemently attacked and criticized his federalist opponents through the press that he owned. This tension would see the federalists split from the centralist congress in Santafe and form a federalist one in Tunja. The two sides engaged in a brief civil war in 1812, where Narino took command of the Centralist military forces and successfully defeated them when they attempted to capture Santafe in early 1813.

Nariño was not originally a military officer by nature, but would take his first steps in that direction in 1813 when he was president of Cundinamarca and he offered to command the united forces of the State that he governed with those of the United Provinces of New Granada, contributed from Tunja by his political rival Camilo Torres Tenorio, in order to march south to recover Popayán and prevent Spanish royalist troops from advancing into the interior of the Republic in an invasion effort ordered by the presidency of Quito.

The initial success of the campaign, which Nariño led victoriously to the gates of the city of Pasto, ended in failure when Nariño was forced to surrender to the military chief of Pasto in May 1814. The following six years were spent again in prison in Spain.

Nariño eventually returned to America in 1820 traveling through the Caribbean and Venezuela. By then his homeland had been liberated from Spanish control and had joined in union with Venezuela to form the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). On February 20, 1821, in recognition of his impact and leadership President Simón Bolívar made him interim vice-president of the new republic. Bolívar also asked Nariño to proceed to install in Villa del Rosario the constitutional congress that would ultimately create the 1821 Constitution and where he ran as a candidate to continue being vice-president of Colombia, however he would ultimately lose the race to General Francisco de Paula Santander.

Defeated politically he was given nominal roles within the government and continued publishing his newspaper &quot;Los Toros de Fucha&quot; (The Bulls from Fucha). Towards the last years of his life he became tired and ill with tuberculosis, he decided to quit his public roles and move to Villa de Leyva. Nariño died there on December 13, 1823. He is considered as one of the founding fathers of modern Republic of Colombia and a hero of the war of independence. Many monuments, towns and provinces carry his name in his honor.

== Early life ==
Antonio Amador José de Nariño y Álvarez del Casal was born on April 9, 1765, in Santafe de Bogota, the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada a territorial entity of the Spanish Empire. Born to an aristocratic family, he was the third son of Vicente Nariño y Vásquez, a Spaniard from Galicia, and Catalina Álvarez del Casal a noblewoman from Santafe. His father had moved to New Granada in 1751 as the Official Royal Accountant of New Granada, and headed the first gunpowder factory in Santafé (modern-day Bogotá). He was later promoted to Major Accountant, an important role that he played up to his death in 1778. Nariño&#x27;s mother was the sister of Manuel Álvarez del Casal, one of the attorneys of the Royal Audience.

Details about his early life are scarce, but apparently, he studied in the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé, a well-known Jesuit school in Bogotá, which had been founded in 1604.

In 1781 during the crisis sparked by Revolt of Comuneros of the Socorro Province, Nariño was enlisted as second lieutenant flag bearer in the Urban Infantry Militia Regiment to defend the viceregal government from the uprising, however he did not take place in any of the confrontations of the revolution. With the rebellion crushed, he returned to civilian life as a merchant establishing business contacts in the important ports of Honda and Cartagena as he dealt in the export of tobacco, cacao, and other crops.

Nariño married Magdalena Ortega y Mesa in 1785, with whom he had six children. By then, he was already a merchant and proactively involved in politics. In 1789, he was appointed ordinary major of Santafé, as well as General Treasurer of Tithes. By 1793, he had opened his own print shop and had obtained a license from the government to be allowed to print, which would later bring him trouble.

== Early political activity ==
Nariño was intellectually curious and admired the political ideologies of the leaders of the French and American Revolutions. In his impressive library there was a portrait of Benjamin Franklin above the mantle. In his youth, Nariño was a strong influence among the progressive young people of Bogotá, Colombia, hosting secret political gatherings that he called &quot;The Sanctuary,&quot; where the need for independence and the means of achieving it were discussed. Attendees included later notables , , Luis de Rieux, Manuel Torres and Francisco Antonio Zea. Nariño was one of the most outspoken and articulate participants at these meetings and was widely respected by his fellow revolutionaries.

In 1794, Nariño procured a copy of the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man&quot;, which was being distributed by the French Assembly. He translated the Declaration of the Rights of Man from its original French into Spanish and printed several copies from his own private press. He then circulated these translated pamphlets among his politically like-minded friends. Copies of the pamphlet were distributed to all corners of the continent and created a stirring in the political mentalities of the time. The government soon discovered the material, and any copy that was found was burned. Nariño was arrested on August 29, 1794, as were many of the fellow attendees of his Sanctuary meetings, and underwent trials during the rest of the year and the next one. His attorney, , was arrested as well, so no other lawyer wanted to defend his case, and he and his followers were sentenced to ten years of imprisonment in Africa for his leading role in the political group and was exiled from South America. In addition to this, all his property was confiscated. Nariño had previously worked as a tithe collector (&quot;Recaudador de diezmos&quot;) and was also accused of fraud resulting from this activity.

Nariño managed to escape in Cádiz, however, and then fled to Paris in 1795, where he devoted himself to the study of the French Revolution and its aftermath. This convinced him of the idea that centralized government was a superior form of government. After spending some time in France, Nariño went to England to look for economic and military support from the British but when he was denied it, he decided to return to Santafé (modern-day Bogotá). He traveled in disguise, but eventually he found himself forced to surrender to the authorities, on July 19, 1797. In prison he contracted tuberculosis. He was finally released in 1803, due to his health, and he recovered little by little.

By 1809, however, following the unrest all around the colonies over the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, many people started to meet clandestinely to discuss independence. Some of these conspirators, among them the priest Andrés Rosillo y Meruelo, started discussing a coup to overthrow the government and establish a republic in its stead, and the name of Nariño started circulating. Hearing of said rumors, viceroy Amar y Borbón decided to crush the rebellion before it started, and Nariño found himself arrested yet again when insurrections started to break all over the American colonies. He was moved to the prison in Cartagena de Indias, although he managed to escape briefly, only to be captured again on December 20, 1809, in Santa Marta. Nariño remained imprisoned in Cartagena, and was about to be sent to Puerto Rico, but he was freed in June 1810, following the city&#x27;s declaration of independence. Following his release from prison, he had to wait for a few months in Cartagena before returning to his family. In December 1810, Nariño returned to Santafé, and became deeply involved in the creation of a sovereign state, independent from Spain.

== The Aftermath of the Declaration of Independence and The Foolish Fatherland ==

Following the formation of Juntas all over the country, profound divisions became evident when trying to determine what type of government should be placed instead of the Spanish crown. In particular, disagreements on whether there should be a single state in the place of the old New Kingdom of Granada or whether the provinces should become autonomous and independent states became a matter of heated debate. The provinces, led by the province of Cartagena, called for a federal solution that gave them equal rights, and were not willing to submit to authorities sent from the capital just like they had submitted to Spanish authorities in the past. In contrast, the province of Cundinamarca, which held the former viceroyal capital, Santafé, was the richest and most populous province, and assumed that it would inherit the authority of the old regime, its leaders fearing the loss of power and privileges that would come with a federalist government. When the Cartagena junta called for a separate General Conference in Medellín, where each province would be represented in proportion to their populations, the Supreme Junta of Santafé decided to counter by inviting each province to send a delegate to form an interim government while a general congress was summoned to establish a Constitutional Assembly for the whole New Granada.

Nariño returned to Santafé just on time to participate in the organization of the Congress of the United Provinces of New Granada, being appointed secretary. The congress was irregular from the start, as it was formed by delegates from barely a handful of provinces (Santa Fe, Socorro, Neiva, Pamplona, Nóvita, and Mariquita), and was deeply divided on whether the cities of Mompós (by then part of the Cartagena province) and Sogamoso, which had sent delegates, should be considered provinces. In the congress, held between December 22, 1810, and February 2, 1811, Nariño was the leader of a push to establish the Congress permanently in Santafé, a proposal that was rejected by the provinces, which saw in this a push for deferral to Santafé, Following profound disagreements, the Congress was dissolved barely more than a month later, when the members stopped attending the sessions. 

As provinces were already busy establishing their own autonomous governments, under the lead of Jorge Tadeo Lozano, the Junta Suprema in Santafé called for a constitutional assembly for the province. In March 1811, the province convened a &quot;Constituent Electoral College of the State of Cundinamarca,&quot; which promulgated a constitution the following month declaring the creation of the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca, with Lozano as president. This constitution followed the model of the Constitution of the United States, and established Cundinamarca as a Catholic and constitutional monarchy, under the absent Ferdinand VII (it would only declare full independence from Spain in August 1813).

While the constitution was mostly federalist, centralist ideas were evident in its writing, and it provided for the eventual annexation of other provinces which would then have to obey the provincial constitution. Nariño, who was recently widowed, was appointed as mayor of the city of Santafé on August 30, 1811, and being a fervent centralist, started pushing for a strong centralist position from the newspaper he created, &quot;La Bagatela&quot; (or The Triffle), which he started publishing on July 14, 1811. In &quot;La Bagatela&quot;, Nariño became a ruthless critic of Lozano, whom he accused of indecisiveness. The aggressive criticisms by Nariño and his followers led to a riot in the city on September 19, 1811, following which president Lozano and his vice president were forced to resign. Fearful of popular rioting, the legislature elected Nariño as president and conceded to his demands, which increased the influence of the executive power.

The &quot;Congress of the United Provinces,&quot; meanwhile, had started meeting again. In spite of Cundinamarca&#x27;s opposition, the Congress finally achieved an agreement and delivered the &quot;Act of Federation of the United Provinces of New Granada&quot; on November 27, 1811, a heavily federalist act. The act provided a lot of autonomy to each province, and an extremely weak president who would be subordinate to the congress. This only made the differences between centralist and federalist ideas even stronger. Nariño and his followers became ardent opponents to federalism and to the congress and were convinced that the economic and political power of Cundinamarca would allow the province to dominate and unify New Granada. Nariño convened an assembly to revise the constitution of the state and make it even more centralist and then decided to annex the surrounding provinces of Tunja, Socorro, Pamplona, Mariquita, and Neiva, but was mostly unsuccessful on both enterprises. Nevertheless, the relentless hostility and harassment from Nariño&#x27;s partisans pushed the members of the Congress to leave Santafé and to escape, first to Leyva and finally to Tunja. This would be the start of the period in the history of the recently founded country that would later be called &quot;the Foolish Fatherland.&quot;

Soon, the Cundinamarca province became embroiled in civil war against other provinces, particularly Tunja, where the Congress had settled. Nariño ordered General Antonio Baraya to defeat the federalist leaders in Tunja, but Baraya decided to switch sides and support the federalist forces, and many important leaders like Santander and Caldas joined him. Baraya, and the rebels with him, signed an act that declared Nariño a usurper and a tyrant, and pledged loyalty to the Congress. Nariño used the opportunity to request extraordinary powers from the legislature of Cundinamarca, which allowed him to be appointed as a dictator. On November 26, 1812, Nariño left with his army to conquer Tunja. On December 2, 1812, his army faced a federalist army commanded by Antonio Ricaurte and Atanasio Girardot in the Battle of Ventaquemada, and was soundly defeated, having to retreat back to Santafé. The federalist troops, however, only started pursuing them more than a week later.

Following this defeat, and the subsequent declaration of independence from the province of Socorro, Nariño resigned as soon as he arrived in the city, but not finding a suitable replacement, he was reinstalled as dictator. Nariño then prepared to defend the city, which was put under siege by the Congress&#x27; army on December 24, 1812. Nevertheless, on January 9, 1813, in the Battle of San Victorino, Nariño&#x27;s troops proved superior, and the federalist armies were completely defeated. In June 1813, he was appointed dictator for life, and the following month, the Republic of Cundinamarca finally declared independence from the Spanish Monarchy.

==Southern campaign==

In July 1813, General Nariño began an intensive military campaign against the Spanish and Royalist forces in the south of the country, intending to reach Pasto and eventually Quito. Nariño&#x27;s forces, known as the &#x27;Army of the South,&#x27; and numbering between 1.500 and 2.000 men, managed to capture Popayán in January 1814 after defeating the Royalist forces in the area in a series of initially successful battles.

After stopping to reorganize the city&#x27;s government and his own forces, he pressed on towards Pasto. Historians have speculated that, had he not stopped at Popayán but actually decisively pursued the fleeing Royalist army, he might have been able to successfully capture a relatively undefended Pasto.

As things went, however, the constant raids by Royalist guerrillas, the harshness of the terrain, the lack of promised reinforcements from Antioquia, and the delays in bringing up his army&#x27;s artillery contributed to weakening the morale of many of the troops under Nariño&#x27;s command, when they had practically reached the gates of Pasto. On May 10, 1814, in the Battle of the Ejidos (Commons) of Pasto, the royalist army led by Melchior Aymerich attacked Nariño&#x27;s army. After being wounded during combat, a false rumor of his death was spread, and most of the remaining soldiers scattered, only some 400 returning to Popayán. Waiting for reinforcements, Nariño decided to send his officers back to Popayán while he harangued his few remaining troops. Nariño was left practically alone in the battlefield, and attempted to hide in the surrounding mountains, but finally surrendered himself when Royalist scouts found him, hungry and exhausted, on May 14. He had hoped he would be able to negotiate an armistice. He was taken into Pasto in May 1814, and then sent to the Royal prison at Cádiz via Quito on July 15, 1815. From there, he was sent to Lima, where he was taken by ship to Cádiz, arriving on the first weeks of March 1816. Nariño would remain a prisoner in Cádiz for the next four years.

==Later years==

Nariño was freed from imprisonment in 1821, following the revolt of Rafael del Riego, and returned to his home country, Colombia, now independent from Spain after the republican victory at the Battle of Boyacá.

Nariño was one of the candidates for election to the presidency of Gran Colombia in 1821, which he lost to Simón Bolívar by the significant margin of 50 to 6 votes in the Congress held at Cúcuta, finishing second. He also lost the election for vice president, with Francisco de Paula Santander (a former federalist soldier) eventually defeated by a 38 to 19 vote margin after several heated rounds of voting. Santander and others had been victorious in battle, while Nariño was not, and his popularity had been severely affected. This is also the year where a constituent assembly met in Cúcuta to draft a constitution for the new state.

Nariño returned to Santafé, now officially called Bogotá, in 1821, defeated politically and in poor health, following the many years of struggles and imprisonment. He was appointed military commander, a nominal charge without effective power. By then, he had lost the popularity he had enjoyed in the city during the Foolish Fatherland times. As he had done before with &quot;La Bagatela&quot;, he decided to create a newspaper: &quot;Los Toros de Fucha&quot; (The Bulls from Fucha), to publish his opposition against Santander and his government, but unlike Lozano, Santander was far from weak, and Nariño instead of returning to power came to be interrogated by Santander. His enemies did not want him to be in power because of his origin from Cundinamarca. According to his biographers (arguably partisans), to make sure he did not get elected they accused him of malfeasance of public funds, cowardice, and treason, but Nariño managed to defend himself. Tired and ill with tuberculosis, he decided to quit his public roles and move to Villa de Leyva. Nariño died there on December 13, 1823, having become a national hero of Colombia.

== Legacy ==
While playing a minor role in the independence war against Spain, Nariño was widely acknowledged at his time and afterwards as a precursor of separatist ideas. He is mentioned in the last stanza of the Colombian national anthem. At the foot of his memorial statue in Bogotá he is quoted: &quot;I have loved my country; only History will say what this love has been.&quot;

The presidential palace of the Republic of Colombia, Casa de Nariño or Palacio de Nariño, was constructed at the site of his birthplace and named in his honor.

The department of Nariño was also named in his honor.

Nariño&#x27;s face has appeared in the $10 and $100 Colombian peso banknotes.

<text>Elwood Gordon Gee (born February 2, 1944) is an American academic administrator. Since 2014, he is serving his second term as president of West Virginia University; his first term there was from 1981 to 1985. Gee is said to have held more university presidencies than any other American. He was head of University of Colorado Boulder from 1985 to 1990, of Ohio State University from 1990 to 1997, of Brown University from 1998 to 2000, of Vanderbilt University from 2000 to 2007, and of Ohio State University for a second time from 2007 to 2013.

Gee stepped down from the Ohio State presidency in 2013 after controversies about anti-Catholic comments allegedly made in jest about the University of Notre Dame. He headed an Ohio State-based think tank before returning to West Virginia University.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Gee was born in Vernal, Utah which is southeast of Salt Lake City, the son of an oil company employee and a school teacher. Growing up a Mormon in Vernal, he served a mission in Germany and Italy. He is an Eagle Scout and a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He attended the University of Utah and graduated with a B.A. in history in 1968. After earning a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1971 and an Ed.D. from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1972, Gee was named a judicial fellow and staff assistant to the Supreme Court for one year.

After clerking for Chief Justice Warren Burger, Gee accepted a position as professor and associate dean at Brigham Young University. He became dean and professor at West Virginia University&#x27;s law school in 1979, and president of the university two years later. As president of a university at age 37, he was one of the youngest chief executives in academia at the time.

== Brown University ==
Gee was president of Brown for only two years, and his tenure was mired in controversy. According to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;The College Hill Independent&quot;, one of the university&#x27;s campus newspapers, Gee was criticized by students and faculty for treating the school like a Wall Street corporation rather than an Ivy League university.

Critics pointed to his decisions to sign off on an ambitious brain science program without consulting the faculty, to sell $80 million in bonds for the construction of a biomedical sciences building, and to cut the university&#x27;s extremely popular Charleston String Quartet, which many saw as part of Gee&#x27;s effort to lead the school away from its close but unprofitable relationship with the arts.

Gee left under a storm of criticism in 2000, as members of the Brown community widely accused him of departing from the school after an uncommonly short tenure because of Vanderbilt University&#x27;s offer of a corporate-level salary and a tenured teaching position for his wife. According to a 2003 article by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, Gee was the second highest paid university chief executive in the country with a purported total compensation package of more than $1.3 million.

Gee&#x27;s tumultuous tenure at Brown is commemorated annually with the &quot;E. Gordon Gee Lavatory Complex,&quot; a collection of portable toilets that appears during Spring Weekend.

== Vanderbilt University ==
Gee had high student approval ratings. In 2005, when Gee&#x27;s approval saw a comparatively sharp drop, it still stood at 88.4%. During his tenure, Vanderbilt saw a dramatic increase in student applications— more than 50% in six years—and a rise in the SAT scores of incoming freshmen. Under his tenure, the university completed a $1.25 billion fundraising campaign two years ahead of schedule.

A September 2006 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; article detailed that some of Gee&#x27;s problems at Vanderbilt—including his wife&#x27;s actions (such as smoking marijuana in the chancellor&#x27;s official residence), criticism of the high cost of renovating his home, and the couple&#x27;s lavish spending—had come back to haunt him. Additionally, Gee&#x27;s 2002 announcement that the administration was going to rename Confederate Memorial Hall without the word &quot;Confederate&quot; provoked a series of lawsuits. While Vanderbilt&#x27;s board expressed some concern about Gee&#x27;s spending, they also strongly endorsed his successful leadership. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, he received a total compensation of over $1.8 million in 2005/6, the highest of any continuing university president in the United States.

On March 11, 2003, a student satirical publication at Vanderbilt, &quot;The Slant&quot;, ran a complete mock-up of &quot;The Vanderbilt Hustler,&quot; entitled &quot;The Vanderbilt Huslter&quot;, with the headline &quot;GEE DEAD&quot;. The hoax received some attention from national media, including an appearance on the Drudge Report. Gee&#x27;s office responded to the hoax by releasing a photo of him holding a copy of the &quot;Hustler&quot; (with Gee smiling). Despite Gee&#x27;s good humor about the prank, a controversy ensued.

In September 2003, Gee made national headlines when he eliminated the organized athletic department at Vanderbilt and consolidated its activities under the Division of Student Life, the university&#x27;s general administrative division for student organizations and activities. Some critics cited this reorganization in the recruiting process to call into question Vanderbilt&#x27;s commitment to football. However, Gee&#x27;s action had its supporters, including NCAA President Myles Brand. Furthermore, a stellar spring for Vanderbilt athletic teams and a top-30 finish in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Director&#x27;s Cup ranking of college athletic programs for the 2003–04 academic year provided some vindication for Vanderbilt and Gee.

==Ohio State University==

On July 11, 2007, Gee announced that he would be returning to Ohio State University as its president, ending his 7-year tenure at Vanderbilt. According to &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, he was to receive a base salary of total compensation of over $1 million, the highest of any public university president in the United States, though less than his pay at Vanderbilt.

Controversy arose over Gee&#x27;s alleged usage of public money to live an extravagant lifestyle. The &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; of Dayton, Ohio, reported that &quot;Ohio State has spent more than $64,000 on bow ties, bow tie cookies and O-H and bow tie pins for Gee and others to distribute.&quot;

Gee repeatedly came under fire from the media following public statements of his. In 2010, Gee stated, when talking about the rather weaker schedules of mid-major football programs at Boise State and Texas Christian University compared to the schedules of Ohio State and other Big Ten and SEC programs, &quot;I do know, having been both a Southeastern Conference president and a Big Ten president, that it&#x27;s like murderers&#x27; row every week for these schools. We do not play the Little Sisters of the Poor. We play very fine schools on any given day&quot;. Gee would later apologize for his comments about this well established Catholic religious order, which has been operating in the United States since 1868. He later visited the Little Sisters of the Poor, and claimed he did not know about the organization when he made the comments. TCU ended up getting the last laugh, winning the 2011 Rose Bowl; following the win, a group of TCU alumni paid for space on several digital billboards in the Columbus area in which the &quot;Little Sisters of the Poor&quot; congratulated TCU on its victory.

In 2011, Gee came under fire again for anti-Polish sentiment after comparing being the president at Ohio State to running the Polish army. Gee would later regret making the comment after Polish-American groups strongly responded to his joke about their ethnicity. In response to Gee&#x27;s remarks, the Polish American Congress demand Gee apologize for &quot;his slur on the military of a nation that has been fighting valiantly and effectively alongside the United States&quot; and for &quot;bigotry and ignorance expressed by the president of such a large and prominent American university, especially since Ohio has a large Polish-American population and many OSU students are of Polish heritage.&quot;

In December 2012 Gee made further offensive anti-Catholic statements. Gee said that the University of Notre Dame should not be added to the Big Ten: On March 11, 2013, Ohio State University trustees sent Gee a letter complaining that he had embarrassed the school with his comments. The anti-defamation chair of the Ancient Order of Hibernians responded with shock that it took six months for Gee to apologize, saying that &quot;this delayed action smacks of damage control for the media, rather than a sincere effort to address a bigoted insult to Catholics.&quot;

Bill Donohue of the Catholic League took a more sympathetic tack regarding the issue: &quot;It&#x27;s time for everyone to take a deep breath,&quot; he commented. &quot;I have never met President Gee, but it is clear from what I read that what he said was made in jest. Was it dumb? ... yes. But context and tone matter, as does the frequency of what may be considered an offensive remark: a real bigot is someone who repeatedly, and maliciously, attacks others. Gee is not such a man. Political correctness has gone too far.&quot;

The Ohio State trustees also felt that Gee made insensitive public comments about the University of Cincinnati, University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, and the Southeastern Conference. The letter laid out the steps Gee must take, which included issuing personal apologies and obtaining professional help to improve personal communications and speech writing processes. Shortly thereafter, the full text of Gee&#x27;s remarks became public, and it was revealed that during the same speech, he had also taken shots at former Wisconsin football head coach Bret Bielema, saying &quot;[Wisconsin athletic director] Barry Alvarez thought he was a thug.&quot; When asked about the SEC and Louisville saying the Big Ten couldn&#x27;t count after the conference added Maryland and Rutgers during the early-2010s conference realignment to expand the conference to 14 teams, Gee ridiculed the academic standards of Louisville and the SEC schools, saying once they &quot;learned to read and write&quot;, they could start thinking about conference expansion. Gee released an official apology and called his words a poor attempt at humor.

Gee&#x27;s base salary was $802,125, with a total compensation package of $1.6 million. In 2009, he donated a $200,531 bonus and his $20,053 raise to scholarship funds. In 2013, Gee earned $6,057,615 from Ohio State University.

On June 4, 2013, Gee announced his retirement. In a news release, he said, &quot;After much deliberation, I have decided it is now time for me to turn over the reins of leadership to allow the seeds that we have planted to grow. It is also time for me to reenergize and refocus myself.&quot;

== West Virginia University ==
On December 5, 2013, West Virginia University announced that Gee would become its interim president until the search for a permanent president concluded. Following an endorsement by the West Virginia University presidential search committee on February 28, 2014, Gee was appointed by the Board of Governors at WVU on March 3 to be the University&#x27;s 24th permanent president. In August 2023, Gee announced a plan to shutter 10% of the university&#x27;s majors, eliminate all language teaching, and fire 16% of its faculty, to address a budget crunch caused largely by the ill-fated expansion program that he previously pushed. 

On September 6, 2023, the Faculty Assembly of the university passed a symbolic vote of no confidence resolution against Gee, citing his plans to cut faculty and majors. Similarly, in December 2023, the University Assembly published a no confidence vote against Gee, by a vote of 797 to 100.

== Personal life ==
Gee has been married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth D. Gee, with whom he had one daughter, Rebekah Gee. Gordon and his daughter were featured on an episode of the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot; discussing life after Elizabeth&#x27;s death. Gee divorced his second wife, Constance Bumgarner Gee, in 2007. During the summer of 2016, Gee became engaged to Laurie Erickson of the Erickson Foundation. Gee&#x27;s daughter Rebekah was appointed Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals in 2016.

In 2001, Gee received the Judge Elbert P. Tuttle Distinguished Achievement Award, the highest recognition of achievement in the Pi Kappa Alpha International fraternity. In 2012, Gee became the first Honorary Esteemed Member of the University of Colorado&#x27;s Buff Bow Tie Bunch (BBTB).

Gee has donated more than $10,000 to Democratic and Republican political campaigns since 2010.

Gee served on the board of directors of L Brands.

<doc id="1063132" wikidata="Q7720513" url="?curid=1063132" title="The Buffalo Skinners">
<text>The Buffalo Skinners is the sixth studio album by the Scottish band Big Country, which was released in March 1993. Two songs, &quot;We&#x27;re Not In Kansas&quot; and &quot;Ships&quot;, are re-recordings of songs from their previous album. The difference is more noticeable on &quot;Ships&quot; which features heavy use of guitars (in contrast to the guitar-free 1991 version). The album featured two UK top 30 hits, &quot;Alone&quot; (No. 24) and &quot;Ships&quot; (No. 29).

In 2020, Cherry Red Records released a deluxe box-set &quot;Out Beyond the River: The Compulsion Years&quot; which featured an expanded version of the original album augmented with bonus tracks and the previously released live album &quot;Without the Aid of a Safety Net&quot;. The set also included a DVD with highlights from the Glasgow Barrowlands concert and promo videos for &quot;Ships&quot; and &quot;Alone&quot;. The set is housed in a clamshell box.

==Background==
After the disappointing sales of their 1991 album &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;, Big Country were dropped by their label, Phonogram. The band decided to split up, but a couple of weeks later lead vocalist and guitarist Stuart Adamson phoned guitarist Bruce Watson to suggest the band give things another go, and in turn he and bassist Tony Butler agreed to reunite. The band were quickly signed to Compulsion by the label&#x27;s boss Chris Briggs, who as an A&amp;R man, had originally signed the band to Phonogram in 1982. They recorded &quot;The Buffalo Skinners&quot; as a trio alongside session drummer Simon Phillips.

In a 1993 interview with &quot;Sunday Life&quot;, Watson revealed that both &quot;Peace in Our Time&quot; and &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; (1991) were &quot;stodgy affairs aimed at the American market&quot; and a compromise to meet with Phonogram&#x27;s commercial expectations for the band. Watson said, &quot;Now we&#x27;re back to doing what we do best – being Big Country. The new album is what we are about – we produced it ourselves and are really proud of it.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Lennox Herald&quot;, Adamson said, &quot;We decided to produce ourselves because ultimately we know what kind of sound we&#x27;re looking for. In terms of the spirit and commitment this is the best record we&#x27;ve made since the first two. We were told [by Compulsion] just to go in, record it and get over what we wanted musically.&quot;

Once the band&#x27;s former drummer Mark Brzezicki heard the album, he asked to rejoin the band and did so in time for the band&#x27;s forthcoming tour.

==Critical reception==

On its release, Neil McKay of &quot;Sunday Life&quot; praised &quot;The Buffalo Skinners&quot; as &quot;a long overdue return to form&quot;. He wrote, &quot;With the guitars right up front this strays close to hard rock territory, but the songs are as rousing and tuneful as in their early heyday.&quot; Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the album as &quot;quaintly old-fashioned, but performed with conviction&quot;. He added, &quot;Big Country still write strident rock anthems with a tartan twist, and reflect on love, greed and blue-collar angst.&quot;

Johnny Dee of &quot;NME&quot; noted that, despite the &quot;echo-urban-warrior chest thumpery&quot;, the album is &quot;still plain old flag-waving rock&quot; which &quot;couples squalling six-string excess&quot; with the band&#x27;s &quot;more familiar triumphant, fists in the air, &#x27;we-shall-overcome-just-be-yourself&#x27; lager advert choruses&quot;. He praised the band&#x27;s &quot;talent for exultant, fanfaring stadium rock&quot; but felt that their &quot;resolutely poker-faced earnestness makes them so ripe for ridicule&quot;. He felt the overriding lyrical theme saw them &quot;cast as some kind of new world superheroes surveying a planet destroyed by mega-corp empire building&quot; which would be &quot;fair enough if the lyrics themselves weren&#x27;t so much hackneyed school project marvellous&quot;. Dee concluded, &quot;One man&#x27;s passionate anthemic epic-rock is another man&#x27;s heap of steaming soft metal dung. Whatever your persuasion, &quot;The Buffalo Skinners&quot;, destined to be Big Country&#x27;s sixth top ten album, won&#x27;t disappoint.&quot;

<text>Gladys Lillian Moncrieff (13 April 1892 – 8 February 1976) was an Australian singer who was so successful in musical theatre and recordings that she became known as &#x27;Australia&#x27;s Queen of Song&#x27; and &#x27;Our Glad&#x27;.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Moncrieff was born in Bundaberg, Queensland. Her father Robert Edward Moncrieff was a piano tuner, and her mother, who went by the stage name Amy Lambell, was a professional singer; they lived in North Isis. She attended several schools in north Queensland, and quickly became involved in music. Her first stage performance was at the age of six at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in Bundaberg, where she sang the American folk song &quot;The Merriest Girl That&#x27;s Out&quot; with her father accompanying on piano. She performed in Gilbert and Sullivan productions. At the 1907 Charters Towers eisteddfod, Gladys shared first prize for her junior soprano rendition of &quot;O for the Wings of a Dove&quot; with local girl Eileen Coleman.

When she left school, she and her parents travelled around far north Queensland performing. Moncrieff was billed as &#x27;Little Gladys: The Australian Wonder Child&#x27; and her performances helped her to raise funds to move to Brisbane to pursue her career. She worked in Brisbane and Toowoomba during 1909, and then went to Sydney with her mother. In Sydney she auditioned for Hugh J. Ward for a position in J. C. Williamson&#x27;s theatre. She was successful, and with a starting salary of £3 per week she spent 18 months receiving singing lessons from Ward&#x27;s wife, Madame Grace Miller. In January 1913 she had a small part in &quot;The Sunshine Girl&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney. In 1914 she was in the chorus of a house Gilbert and Sullivan production; for there she took on leading roles such as Josephine in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. The company toured New Zealand and performed in Melbourne.
Moncrieff toured South Africa and New Zealand as a leading lady in numerous productions. When she returned to Australia she landed her most famous role as Teresa in Harold Fraser-Simson&#x27;s light opera &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot;, which she first performed in Melbourne in 1921. The waltz song &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; became particularly associated with her. The Maid was to become the most frequently revived musical of the Australian stage, and Moncrieff appeared in it some 2,800 times. She also was a success in &quot;A Southern Maid&quot; in 1923.

Contemporary critics wrote of the purity, richness, power and wide range of her voice, her conviction of style and her clear enunciation. H. Brewster-Jones spoke of the &quot;richness of quality and expression in her well produced voice, and makes a striking appeal to a concert audience with her platform manner and interpretive abilities&quot; in a 1938 review of a concert performance at the Adelaide Town Hall.

===Later years===
In May 1924, Moncrieff married Thomas Henry Moore, at St James&#x27; Church, Sydney in a ceremony that attracted a large crowd. Moore became her manager. While honeymooning in England and France, she made her first gramophone recordings for the Vocalion Company. In Australia she was hugely successful as a musical comedy performer. She earned £150 a week, which made her one of the highest-paid performers in the history of Australian theatre. She left Australia for the stage in England in 1926. Her first show there was poorly received, but when she appeared in Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Mazurka&quot; in 1927, her success in England was assured. While in England she made 37 more gramophone recordings, which were sold locally and exported to Australia where they sold successfully.

Her marriage was not successful and she began to live apart from her husband, and then returned to Australia to appear in John Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Rio Rita&quot;. The production was a commercial success and her career in Australia bloomed. She had a radio show in Australia and in the 1930s undertook tours for the New Zealand Broadcasting Service with New Zealand pianist Gil Dech. She also appeared in the Australian musicals &quot;Collits&#x27; Inn&quot; and &quot;The Cedar Tree&quot; for producer F. W. Thring.

Her career was put on hold in March 1938 when she was involved in a motor vehicle accident, and she did not return to the stage until June 1940. She returned to perform in musical comedy, and was engaged to entertain Australian troops fighting in the Second World War at home and in New Guinea, and she became very active raising funds for war-related charities. In 1951 she toured Japan and Korea to entertain British and Australian occupation forces. For her wartime contributions, she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1952 for services to patriotic and charitable movements.

She continued her stage and radio work, and during 1958 and 1959 began her farewell stage tour of Australia and New Zealand. Her final stage appearance was at Hamilton, New Zealand, and her last public performance was in a televised concert in Brisbane in 1962. She retired to the Gold Coast, Queensland in 1968 and prepared her memoirs &quot;My Life of Song&quot; which was ghosted by Lillian Palmer and published in 1971. In 1962 Moncrieff made guest appearances on George Wallace Jnr’s television show &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;.

Moncrieff came outside of her Gold Coast home on a canal to wave to the people on the canal cruise boats whilst they played her arias.

Moncrieff died at Pindara Private Hospital at the Gold Coast at the age of 83. In 1984, a new Gold Coast federal electoral division was created and was named the Division of Moncrieff in honour of the singer.

==Legacy==

The federal electoral division of Moncrieff in Queensland, and the Canberra suburb Moncrieff are both named in her honour. Her image was featured on an Australian postage stamp in 1989. The main entertainment complex in Bundaberg was named the Moncrieff Theatre, later changed to the Moncrieff Entertainment Centre.
A Gold Coast park was named in her honour, and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre maintains the Gladys Moncrieff Library of the Performing Arts.

A book &quot;Gladys Moncrieff : Australia&#x27;s Queen of Song&quot; by Adrian Magee was published in 1996. A 2-CD release of her recordings was put out in 2012 entitled &quot;Gladys Moncrieff – Our Glad: The Queen of Song&quot;, based on her 1920s and 1930s recordings; four earlier CDs contain all of the songs on this 2-CD release plus others, and were released in the 1990s: &quot;Gladys Moncrieff Sings Musical Comedy &amp; Operetta&quot;, &quot;Gladys Moncrieff: the Golden Years&quot;, &quot;Gladys Moncrieff: Australia&#x27;s Queen of Song&quot;, &quot;Gladys Moncrieff: Favourite Popular Ballads&quot;; a few additional songs are found on the double cassette: &quot;Gladys Moncrieff: Stage Musicals&quot;.

Her personal papers, including correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings and theatre programs are held at the State Library of Queensland.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Gladys Moncrieff was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for her role as an &quot;Influential Artists&quot;.

<text>Democratic Defense () was one of the many anti-dictatorial struggle groups that fought against the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. It evolved from the &quot;Alexandros Papanastasiou&quot; political research group in 1967, as a response to the regime.

In reality, there was no leader, but after arrest, the members nominated as leader a prominent retired general, general George Iordanides, because he was the best-known personality among all the participants as he had held high ranking positions in the NATO during the 1950s. The organisation responded to the brutal regime with bombings to some targets that represented the financial supporters of the junta (like the Esso-PAPPAS gas station blowing in 1969).

Among its most widely known members were film director Jules Dassin, Costas Simitis, subsequently Prime Minister of Greece, Nikos Konstantopoulos, subsequently president of the Synaspismos party, professor of economics in Panteion University , , professor of criminal law in the University of Athens, Pavlos Zannas,a writer and film critic, general Georgios Iordanides, a well known military analyst and a national security advisor of Georgios Papandreou during , Vasilis Filias, professor of sociology in Panteion University, lawyer Dimosthenis Konaris, John Starakis, a journalist, Christos Rokofyllos, subsequently minister of Foreign Affairs, , a trade union member, Athanasios Filias, a mechanical engineer, Georgios Kouvelakis, subsequent minister of Justice, brothers Antonios Michalakeas (later on a judge of the Supreme Court of Greece) and Athanassios Michalakeas (later on a president of the court of Appeal), Georgios Kosmas (later on also a member of the supreme court of Greece), (later on also a judge of the Supreme Court of Greece and a member of the European Parliament elected with PASOK), Ioannis Papadopoulos, a well known plastic surgeon (later on a minister of Health during the formed by PASOK in 1981) etc.

The trial began in March 1970, and most of the members were condemned to heavy sentences after months of trial. The trial attracted the attention of the press, and it was considered as a major act of resistance against the regime of the colonels because many of the accused persons held important positions in the public life of Greece and they represented an intellectual elite with center/center left views of governance. Many people who belonged to different political camps like Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, an ex prime minister, or Georgios Rallis and , both significant ministers in the ERE government, stood up as witnesses of defence, while it was known that they did not share the same convictions with the accused, giving the idea to the people of a solid front against the junta. Thus this organisation achieved to shake the impression that people who belonged to the establishment were continuing to support the junta, especially when it was revealed to the eyes of the public that generals, lawyers or active judges, who were amongst them, had developed a dynamic form of resistance against the military regime. With the collapse of the junta in 1974 most of the members of the group aligned with Andreas Papandreou and they were integrated in the PASOK political party, even though their views were not absolutely similar to the political beliefs of the party leader,

<doc id="1063160" wikidata="Q188120" url="?curid=1063160" title="Yoichiro Nambu">
<text>was a Japanese-American physicist and professor at the University of Chicago.

Known for his contributions to the field of theoretical physics, he was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2008 for the discovery in 1960 of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics, related at first to the strong interaction&#x27;s chiral symmetry and later to the electroweak interaction and Higgs mechanism. 

The other half was split equally between Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa &quot;for the discovery of the origin of the broken symmetry which predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks in nature.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Nambu was born on 18 January 1921 in Tokyo, Empire of Japan. After graduating from the then-Fukui Secondary High School in Fukui City, he enrolled in the Imperial University of Tokyo (Now University of Tokyo) and studied physics. He was a lieutenant (technical lieutenant 技術中尉) in the Imperial Japanese Army. 

He received his Bachelor of Science in 1942 and Doctorate of Science in 1952. In 1949, he was appointed to associate professor at Osaka City University and promoted to professorship the next year at the age of 29.

In 1952, Nambu was invited by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States, to study. He moved to the University of Chicago in 1954 and was promoted to professor in 1958. From 1974 to 1977, Nambu was also served as the Chairman of the Department of Physics, and then he became as an American citizen from 1970 until his death in 2015.

== Career in physics ==
Nambu proposed the &quot;color charge&quot; of quantum chromodynamics,
having done early work on spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics,
and having discovered that the dual resonance model could be explained as a quantum mechanical theory of strings.
He was accounted as one of the founders of string theory.

After more than fifty years as a professor, he was Henry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor emeritus at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Department of Physics and Enrico Fermi Institute.

The Nambu–Goto action in string theory is named after Nambu and Tetsuo Goto. Also, massless bosons arising in field theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking are sometimes referred to as Nambu–Goldstone bosons.

== Death ==
Nambu died of heart failure at the hospital in Osaka on 5 July 2015, at the age of 94. The announcement of his death was delayed until 17 July, just 12 days after his death. His funeral and memorial services were held among close relatives.

Nambu was survived by his wife, Chieko, and his son, John.

== Recognition ==
The Nambu Hall was opened on the second floor of Osaka University Graduate School of Science, J Building in 2017.

The Osaka Metropolitan University Nambu Yoichiro Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics (NITEP) was founded on November 1, 2018.

Nambu won numerous honors and awards including: 
* 1970: Dannie Heineman Prize
* 1977: J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize
* 1978: Order of Culture, Japan
* 1978: Person of Cultural Merit, Japan
* 1979: Honorary Citizen of Fukui City, Japan
* 1982: National Medal of Science
* 1985: Max Planck Medal, Germany
* 1986: Dirac Prize
* 1994: Sakurai Prize
* 1994/1995: Wolf Prize in Physics
* 2003: Fukui Prefectural Award, Japan
* 2005: Benjamin Franklin Medal, Franklin Institute
* 2005: Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture
* 2008: Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics&quot;.
*2011: Honorary Citizen of Toyonaka City

<text>Dinner Key is a marina complex in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida, along the shore of Biscayne Bay on South Bayshore Drive. It was originally an island, but was connected to the mainland in 1914 by filling in the intervening space. An early source attributes the name to the island being a convenient place to stop to eat while traveling by boat between the mouth of the Miami River and Snapper Creek south of Miami. Dinner Key is accessible by public transit via the Coconut Grove Circulator from the Miami Metrorail at Coconut Grove and Douglas Road stations. Formerly, it has been the location of Coast Guard Air Station Dinner Key and International Pan American Airport (whose terminal building is now Miami City Hall).

==Dinner Key Auditorium==

One of Pan Am&#x27;s hangars was used for many years as an exhibition hall and auditorium, the Dinner Key Auditorium, which was renamed the Coconut Grove Convention Center. From 2007 to 2013, the center was used as a permanent set for the USA television series &quot;Burn Notice&quot;. The building was demolished in early 2014 to make way for a new plan from the City of Miami.

<doc id="1063168" wikidata="Q7165342" url="?curid=1063168" title="Penuche">
<text>Penuche (, from ) is a fudge-like candy made from brown sugar, butter, and milk, using no flavorings except for vanilla. Penuche often has a tannish color, and is lighter than regular fudge. It is formed by the caramelization of brown sugar; thus, its flavor is said to be reminiscent of caramel. Nuts, especially pecans, are often added to penuche for texture, frequently in the making of penuche candies. It is primarily a regional food, found in New England and some places in the Southern United States, though in the latter it goes by different names, including creamy praline fudge, and brown sugar fudge candy.

==Origins==
&quot;Panocha&quot; is said to come from the Spanish word for &#x27;raw sugar&#x27;. It was also long rumored to be slightly dirty or naughty in nature in Portuguese as slang. Penuche is thought to have origins in Portugal and was made popular in New England among Portuguese whaling families in New Bedford, MA, and Essex, CT, during the whaling period of the mid to late 1700s through the end of commercial whaling. Penuche is also used as a boiled icing flavor. In Hawaii, its name is localized as &quot;panocha&quot; or panuche. As an icing, it was common as topping for prune cake.

==Recipes==
Penuche is classed in the fudge family because it follows a similar method of preparation:
#A fat-sugar solution is heated to the soft ball stage, about .
#The solution is cooled without disturbance to lukewarm, about .
#Flavorings are added and the solution is beaten until thick.
#The mixture is poured into a pan, allowed to cool, and cut into bite-sized pieces.
Most traditional (i.e. not &quot;no-cook&quot; or &quot;quick&quot;) fudges follow a similar preparation method. What distinguishes penuche is the use of brown sugar rather than white.

In recent years, it has become common in New England to add maple syrup to the recipe for penuche fudge. Some confectioners will call this &quot;maple syrup penuche fudge&quot;, and others do not make any distinction at all.

One penuche-style recipe is called &quot;no-bake penuche drop cookies&quot;, which is made from brown sugar, milk, butter, oats, and nuts.

A very similar confection is &quot;Sucre à la Crème&quot; (cream sugar), a Québec confection traditionally prepared during the winter holiday season. The universality of the brown sugar and dairy confection manifests in the form of a slightly crumblier treat called &quot;Tablet&quot; originating in Scotland.

<doc id="1063205" wikidata="Q1110581" url="?curid=1063205" title="Tata Safari">
<text>The Tata Safari is a mid-size SUV produced by the Indian automobile manufacturer Tata Motors since 1998. Safari has been designed as a seven-seater SUV with a foldable third row, roomy interior; on the market it has positioned itself as an alternative from the competitive price to other brands off-road vehicles.

Second Generation was introduced in 2021. Unlike the first generation, the second-generation Safari is a front-wheel-drive, monocoque crossover SUV, sharing its underpinnings with the Tata Harrier.


== First generation (1998) ==

The first-generation Safari was presented in 1998 in India. The Tata range in the nineties saw the expansion into new markets with newer models such as the Indica city car and the Safari. Exports to Europe took place during the same year, with sales in the UK in 1999.

The Safari is powered by the same engine used in the Tata Telcoline, a 2.0-litre Peugeot &quot;XD88&quot; turbodiesel unit with power. It came with a synchromesh forward five-speed manual gearbox, with a 4WD option and 235/75x15 tyres. Compared to the Indian model, the European Safari presented some changes in particular accessories to meet the needs of European customers, the bumpers were different in colour compared to the rest of the bodywork. The name Safari was adopted to emphasize the supposed off-road qualities of the vehicle. In reality, the car was also designed for road use. The Safari is 4.65 meters long from one bumper to the other but the presence of the outer spare wheel increases the size up to 4.81 meters. The weighs of the vehicle is kerb for the 2WD version, adding an extra for the 4WD variant.

In 2017, Tata announced that the Safari Dicor was phased out with the Safari Storme being the only model remaining on sale, until that, too, was discontinued in 2020 due to BS6 norms.

===Evolution===
During the commercial life of the model, various aesthetic and mechanical updates were presented: in 2005 an important facelift was presented that saw the adoption of a new bumper shield, new optical groups and chrome grille, new interior and rear redesigned with graphics of the unpublished lights. New Borg Warner transmission unit and revised braking system. The engine adopted by the 2005 version was the new 3.0-litre four-cylinder diesel common rail &quot;Dicor&quot; with at 3000 rpm and of torque between 1600 and 2000 rpm. The 3,0 litre derived from a commercial Mercedes-Benz engine used in Tata 407 then upgraded.

In December 2006, at the Bologna Motor Show, a further update saw the adoption of the 2.2-litre &quot;Dicor&quot; diesel common rail engine from the PSA Group and revisited with AVL support. The 2.2-litre engine was Euro 4 compliant and replaced the previous unit in European markets while in India, the 3.0-litre engine remained in production. The updated model went on sale during Spring 2007.

In 2010 an aesthetic facelift introduced a new chrome grille, new interior trim, new interior instrumentation with wood inserts for the central console and new body colours.

===Chassis===
The Safari uses Telcoline&#x27;s Tata X2 body-on-frame platform with a redesigned and strengthened rear axle to adapt it to off-road use with part-time all-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive with the option of traction in off-road situations only) with grafting system an electric control up to , self-locking rear differential and manual block front hubs, then eliminated in favor of the fully automatic solution). The front suspension is a double swinging trapezium and torsion bar, while a rigid bridge system with five pulling arms and coil springs has been adopted at the rear. The front brakes are a ventilated disc combined to the rear which is a self-adjusting drum. The braking system is the anti-accumulation system ABS brakes plus electronic brake force distribution EBD from the second series called EX2 (the first series, EX version was not equipped with ABS-EBD and fitted full brake discs, not self-ventilating).

===Engines===
The engine of the first version was a 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel (1948 cc effective), equipped with indirect injection and KKK turbocharger with two valves per cylinder distribution capable of delivering 92 horsepower Euro 2. The engine is derived from the Peugeot &quot;XD88&quot; unit built under license by Tata in India and used by Tata Telcoline and Sierra. With the Euro 3 standard power was reduced to 87 horsepower.

A 2.1 litre 16V petrol engine was added in 2003. Is a straight-4 naturally aspirated developed by Tata Motors and AVL delivering 135 horsepower. In 2005, the 2.1 litre was discontinued.

The 3.0 &quot;Dicor&quot; engine (acronym for &quot;Direct injection common rail&quot;) is the first direct injection diesel engine fitted by the Indian company, a modern four-cylinder engine (derived from a Mercedes-Benz commercial unit), with common rail injection and sixteen valve distribution. It delivers maximum power of and complies with Euro 3 regulations. Maximum torque is delivered between 1,600 and 2,000 rpm. The 3.0 &quot;Dicor&quot; diesel has been removed from the European price list in 2007 with the entry of the 2.2 &quot;Dicor&quot; engine but for the foreign markets the production of 3.0 has continued since it has found a robust and elastic engine despite the few horsepower in relation to the displacement.

The 2.2 &quot;Dicor&quot; engine (based on the PSA Group 2,179 cc DW12 unit, revisited by the Austrian company AVL and produced in India) is always a four-cylinder 16V with common rail direct injection and intercooler, delivers with maximum torque of available between 1,700 and 2,700 rpm. The new engine delivers several more horsepower than the previous units but consumption is lower than in the past: on the mixed cycle the Tata declares to travel , with average emissions of 205 grams of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometre. The 2.2 &quot;Dicor&quot; engine is the first Euro 4 approved engine made.

===Safari Storme (2012–2020)===

The Tata Safari Storme was unveiled in January 2012 during the 11th Auto Expo 2012 and was launched in October 2012.
 The Safari Storme has new front and rear lights, new grille and redesigned bumpers, the rear spare wheel has been moved under the floor and the tailgate is new. More than 100 changes have been done in comparison to the Tata Safari Dicor. The body shell is completely new. But the overall design silhouette remains unchanged though.

The Tata X2 platform has been modified at the rear with the adoption of the new five-arms multi-link suspension (the same of the Tata Aria) which has a stronger hydro-formed chassis sections. It will have an upgraded BorgWarner G76-Mark II gearbox.

Its &quot;Varicor&quot; (Variable Turbine Technology) 32-bit Electronically Controlled, Direct Injection Common Rail engine is available in 5-speed manual transmission capable of at 4000 rpm and at 1700-2700 rpm of maximum torque. This engine is a major revision of the previous &quot;Dicor&quot; engine. In 2015, the new 2.2 &quot;Varicor 400&quot; engine was introduced and is available with 6-speed manual transmission in both the 4x2 and 4x4 flagship versions. The 2.2 &quot;Varicor 400&quot; engine is an evolution of the previous &quot;Varicor&quot; and is capable of at 4000 rpm and at 1750-2500 rpm of maximum torque. The &quot;Dicor&quot; engine is not available in Safari Storme.

In July 2016, Tata Motors conducted a test on the 2.2-litre VariCOR engine with the six-speed automatic transmission, which would be included in the upcoming Storme models by the year end.

In December 2016, Tata Motors was contracted to provide around 3,192 Safari Stormes, as the official vehicle of Indian Army, becoming the successor of Maruti Gypsy. The Tata Safari Storme had to fend off competition from the Mahindra Scorpio, and both vehicles are said to have undergone rigorous analysis which included them being tested on snow, high-terrain as well as marshy lands.

The Storme passed the Army&#x27;s GS800 (General Service 800) vehicle classification which calls for a hard top vehicle with a minimum 800 kg payload and air-conditioning.

The Storme is in service with the Indian Army and Border Security Force, and has also been exported to the Seychelles for the Seychelles Police Force. In 2019, ten Safari Stormes were handed to the Tatmadaw by the Indian ambassador to Myanmar.The weight of this vehicle is 2,570 kg.

== Second generation (2021) ==

In January 2021, Tata Motors launched the All New Safari. It features the 2 litre I4 turbocharged diesel engine, also found in the Tata Harrier and the Jeep Compass. It comes in either six- or seven-seat configurations, with the 6-seater version only found in the top-spec XZ Plus. At the time of introduction, the lineup began with the XE as the lowest equipment level, followed by the XM, XT, XT Plus, XZ, and XZ Plus versions.

On 22 February 2021, the company announced the launch of the Safari Adventurer Persona edition which uses the same colour as shown on the Tata Buzzard and also launched in Orcus White in 2022 (the standard car is available in colours such as Daytona Grey, Orcus White, Royal Blue and Tropical Mist). It was the official sponsor of Vivo IPL2021. It launched the Safari Gold in two colours, Black Gold and White Gold. It gets cosmetic updates as well as some feature additions.

In 10 August 2021, Tata Motors launched the XTA+ variant of the Safari, which has a standard 6-speed automatic sourced from Hyundai and panoramic sunroof.

The Dark edition was launched by the company in January 2022. A special Kaziranga edition was launched as well. A 4x4 version of the car is rumoured to be in production but there is no confirmation by the company yet.

<doc id="1063206" wikidata="Q57572" url="?curid=1063206" title="Werner von Fritsch">
<text>Thomas Ludwig Werner Freiherr von Fritsch (4 August 1880 – 22 September 1939) was a member of the German High Command. He was Commander-in-Chief of the German Army from February 1934 until February 1938, when he was forced to resign after he was falsely accused of being homosexual. His ousting was a major step in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s establishment of tighter control over the armed forces. Just over a year later, before the outbreak of World War II, Fritsch was recalled as Colonel-in-chief of the 12th Artillery Regiment. He died in battle in Poland early in the war, the second German general to perish in that conflict after Wilhelm Fritz von Roettig.

==Early life==
Fritsch was born in Benrath in the Rhine Province of the German Empire. He entered the Prussian Army at the age of 18; in 1901, he transferred to the Prussian Military Academy. In 1911, he was appointed to the German General Staff, where he served during World War I.

==Interwar period==
===Weimar rule===

During the interwar period, Fritsch served in the Weimar Republic&#x27;s Armed Forces (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;). In 1924, Fritsch wrote a letter to where he expressed his hatred of democracy and his hope that General Hans von Seeckt would carry out a &quot;putsch&quot; to establish a military dictatorship. Fritsch declared he was totally opposed to seeing another &quot;black, red and gold cur&quot; as Chancellor (a reference to the colours of the Weimar Republic&#x27;s flag) and wrote that he believed that Germany was being ruined by &quot;the propaganda of the Jewish papers&quot;. Fritsch ended his letter with a list of all whom he hated: For in the last resort Ebert, pacifists, Jews, democrats, black, red, and gold, and the French, and these women, and the whores, and the like, all cunts with the only exception of mother, these females, I tell you, are all the same thing, namely the people who want to destroy Germany. There may be small differences, but in the end it all amounts to the same. We can trust only ourselves. Trustworthyness, Truth &amp; love only there is among us, German Men. Prösterchen, prostata!

The German historian Wolfram Wette wrote that Fritsch had come close to high treason with his letter, as he had taken the &quot;Reichswehreid&quot; oath to defend democracy, and in calling for a &quot;putsch&quot; to destroy the democracy that Fritsch had pledged to defend was an act of &quot;extreme disloyalty to the republic to which he had sworn an oath&quot;. 

Fritsch was heavily involved in the secret German rearmament of the 1920s in which Germany sought to evade the terms of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had essentially disarmed it by limiting its army to 100,000 soldiers and forbidding it to have aircraft or tanks. As such, Fritsch, who worked closely with the Soviet Union with the secret rearmament, favored a pro-Soviet foreign policy and had an extreme hatred for Poland. In 1928, Fritsch began work on the plan that became &quot;Fall Weiss&quot;, the invasion of Poland in 1939. He was promoted to major-general (&quot;Generalmajor&quot;) in 1932 by Kurt von Schleicher, who regarded him as a promising young officer.

===Nazi rule===
After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Fritsch was a strong supporter of the new regime, which he saw as a radical force that, if influenced by people like himself, would be a force for good. Wette wrote that as Fritsch was a member of &quot;group of hardened anti-Semitics&quot; in the officer corps, the anti-Semitism of Adolf Hitler was one of Fritsch&#x27;s most important reasons for supporting the Nazi regime. 

Fritsch was promoted to General der Artillerie and Chief of the Army Command &quot;(Chef der Heeresleitung)&quot; on 1 February 1934, replacing General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord. This was partly because Hitler saw him as a supporter of his regime and partly because Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg valued Fritsch for his professionalism. In February 1934, when Blomberg ordered that all soldiers who might be considered Jewish (by having at least a Jewish parent or grandparent who converted; long before the Nazis, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; did not accept Jews) be given dishonorable discharges, Fritsch made no objection and carried out the order. On 31 December 1934, Fritsch went further and announced that it &quot;goes without saying that an officer [should seek] a wife only within Aryan circles&quot; and that any officer who married a Jewish woman would be dishonourably discharged at once. 

According to William Shirer in &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, Fritsch played a pivotal role when he balked at Hitler&#x27;s initial proposal to the army that he succeed ailing President von Hindenburg upon his death. Fritsch ultimately betrayed the officer corps to the Führer by agreeing to that demand after consulting with his generals. 

In late 1934 or early 1935, Fritsch and Blomberg successfully pressured Hitler into rehabilitating the name of General Kurt von Schleicher (who had been assassinated by the Nazis during the Night of the Long Knives) by claiming that as officers they could not stand the press attacks portraying him as a traitor working for France. In May 1935 a major reorganization of the armed forces resulted in Fritsch taking the new title of Commander-in-Chief of the Army (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres&quot;) effective 1 June.

Fritsch supported the Nazi regime but was antagonistic towards attempts to create rivals to the army, especially the SS. Shirer recalled hearing Fritsch make sarcastic remarks about the SS as well as several Nazi leaders from Hitler downward at a parade in Saarbrücken. He was also worried that Hitler would cause a war with the Soviet Union; like most of his fellow officers, he had supported the Weimar Republic&#x27;s liaison with Moscow. Wette wrote, &quot;It is indisputable that the conservative and nationalistically minded General von Fritsch affirmed the National Socialist state, and he accepted Hitler as a dictator fully and completely. Given this compatibility of outlook, one may doubt whether Fritsch&#x27;s pronounced anti-Semitism reflected &#x27;political naïveté&#x27; as the historian has asserted&quot;.

On 20 April 1936, when Blomberg was promoted to field marshal (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;), Fritsch received promotion to Blomberg&#x27;s vacated rank of colonel general (&quot;Generaloberst&quot;). At this time he was also granted the rank and authority of a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; but without the formal title. On 30 January 1937, to mark the fourth anniversary of the Nazi regime, Hitler personally presented the Golden Party Badge to the remaining non-Nazi members of the cabinet and the military service heads, including Fritsch, and enrolled him in the Party (membership number 3,805,227). 

Fritsch was among the officers present at the Hossbach Conference of 5 November 1937, when Hitler announced that he wanted to go to war as early as 1938. He was very critical of that demand, as he knew the army was not ready. He even went so far as to threaten to resign his command.

==Blomberg–Fritsch Affair==

Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Göring, inspired by the resignation of Blomberg, accused the unmarried Fritsch of engaging in homosexual activity. Fritsch had never been a womaniser and had preferred to concentrate on his army career. He was forced to resign on 4 February 1938. His replacement, Walther von Brauchitsch, had been recommended for the post by Fritsch. Hitler took advantage of the situation through the replacement of several generals and ministers with Nazi loyalists, which strengthened his control of the German Armed Forces (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;). 

It soon became known that the charges were false and an honour court of officers, presided over by Göring himself, examined the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair. Fritsch was acquitted on 18 March, but the damage to his name had been done. The successful annexation of Austria into Greater Germany (&quot;Anschluss&quot;) of 12 March silenced all critics of Hitler, Göring and Himmler. 

Following his acquittal, Fritsch attempted to challenge SS leader Himmler to a duel. Fritsch composed a formal challenge and reportedly practiced his pistol skills in his free time, of which he had plenty as an officer without a command. The letter was given to General Gerd von Rundstedt for delivery, but Rundstedt, seeking to bridge the distrust between the Wehrmacht and SS, ultimately convinced Fritsch to abandon the idea. (Regardless, it is unlikely the encounter could have come about, as Hitler had forbidden highly placed party members, such as Himmler, from dueling.)

Despite the false charges, Fritsch remained loyal to the Nazi regime and maintained his firmly held belief Germany was faced with an international Jewish conspiracy that wanted to ruin the &quot;Reich&quot;. After the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom of November 1938, Fritsch wrote in a letter to a friend on 22 November, &quot;Of course the battle with international Jewry has now officially begun, and as a natural consequence that will lead to war with England and the United States, the political bastions of the Jews&quot;. In a letter to another friend, Baroness Margot von Schutzbar-Milchling, on 11 December 1938, Fritsch wrote: &quot;It is very strange that so many people should regard the future with growing apprehension, in spite of the &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s indisputable successes in the past... Soon after the War, I came to the conclusion that we have to be victorious in three battles, if Germany were again to be powerful:&lt;br&gt;(1) The battle against the working class. Hitler has won this;&lt;br&gt;(2) Against the Catholic Church, perhaps better expressed as Ultramontanism and&lt;br&gt;(3) Against the Jews.&lt;br&gt;We are in the midst of these battles, and the one against the Jews is the most difficult. I hope everyone realizes the intricacies of this campaign&quot;.

Fritsch told Ulrich von Hassell, when the latter tried to involve him in an anti-Nazi plot, that Hitler was Germany&#x27;s destiny and nothing could be done to change that fact.

==World War II and death==
Just before the outbreak of World War II, Fritsch was recalled, and chose to personally inspect the front lines as the &quot;Colonel-in-chief of the 12th Artillery Regiment&quot; during the invasion of Poland, a very unusual activity for someone of his rank. On 22 September 1939, in Praga during the Siege of Warsaw, a Polish bullet (either a machine gun or a sharpshooter) hit the General and tore an artery in his leg. Lieutenant Rosenhagen, adjutant to Fritsch and an eyewitness to his death, wrote in his original, official report:

[...] In this moment the Herr Generaloberst received a gunshot in his left thigh, a bullet tore an artery. Immediately he fell down. I took off his suspenders to bind the wound. The Herr Generaloberst said: &quot;please leave it&quot;, lost consciousness and died, with a foolish grin on his fading face. Only one minute passed between receiving gunshot and death.

Fritsch was the second German general to be killed in combat in World War II—the first being SS commander Wilhelm Fritz von Roettig on 10 September 1939 near Opoczno, Poland. As Fritsch was the second general to be killed in action, the event was closely examined. 

The official verdict was that he deliberately sought death. However, according to Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel (Chief of German High Command) in his memoirs: &quot;The widespread rumour that Fritsch was so embittered that he had deliberately sought death in action is quite false, according to what the officer who reported Fritsch&#x27;s fatal injury to the Führer (in my presence) saw with his own eyes: a stray bullet had struck the Colonel-General while he was conversing with his Staff Officers, and within only a few minutes he had bled to death.&quot;

Fritsch received a ceremonial state funeral four days later in Berlin. William L. Shirer covered the event in his diary entry dated 26 September 1939: &quot;They buried General von Fritsch here this morning. It rained, it was cold and dark – one of the dreariest days I can remember in Berlin. Hitler did not show up, nor Ribbentrop, nor Himmler, though they all returned to Berlin from the front this afternoon.&quot;

==Commemoration==
Despite the controversy that had been associated with him, the &quot;Freiherr von Fritsch Kaserne&quot; (barracks) in Darmstadt was named after Fritsch after his death. The facilities were combined with the adjoining Cambrai Kaserne when the United States Army occupied Darmstadt in 1945. The Cambrai-Fritsch Kaserne was returned to German control in 2008.

<text>Mary Noailles Murfree (January 24, 1850 – July 31, 1922) was an American author of novels and short stories who wrote under the pen name Charles Egbert Craddock. She is considered by many to be Appalachia&#x27;s first significant female writer and her work a necessity for the study of Appalachian literature, although a number of characters in her work reinforce negative stereotypes about the region. She has been favorably compared to Bret Harte and Sarah Orne Jewett, creating post-Civil War American local-color literature.

The town of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, is named after Murfree&#x27;s great-grandfather Colonel Hardy Murfree, who fought in the Revolutionary War.

==Biography==
Murfree was born on her family&#x27;s cotton plantation, Grantland, near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a location later celebrated in her novel, &quot;Where the Battle was Fought&quot; and in the town named after her great-grandfather, Colonel Hardy Murfree. Her father was a successful lawyer of Nashville, and her youth was spent in both Murfreesboro and Nashville. From 1867 to 1869 she attended the Chegary Institute, a finishing school in Philadelphia. Murfree would spend her summers in Beersheba Springs. For a number of years after the Civil War the Murfree family lived in St. Louis, returning in 1890 to Murfreesboro, where she lived until her death.

Being lame from childhood, Murfree turned to reading the novels of Walter Scott and George Eliot. For fifteen successive summers the family stayed in Beersheba Springs in the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee, giving her the opportunity to study the mountains and mountain people more closely.

By the 1870s she had begun writing stories for &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Journal&quot; under the penname of &quot;Charles Egbert Craddock&quot; and by 1878 she was contributing to the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. It was not until seven years later, in May 1885, that Murfree divulged that she was Charles Egbert Craddock to Thomas Bailey Aldrich, an editor at the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;.
Murfree visited the Montvale Springs resort near Knoxville, from 1886. Although she became known for the realism of her accounts, in fact she was from a wealthy family and would have had little contact with the local people while staying at the resorts.

<text>Joel Carver Whitburn (November 29, 1939 – June 14, 2022) was an American author and music historian, responsible for setting up the Record Research, Inc. series of books on record chart placings.

==Early life==
Joel Carver Whitburn was born in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, on November 29, 1939. He started collecting records in his teens, first subscribed to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1953, and when the Hot 100 was introduced in 1958 started recording the chart placings of records on index cards. After graduating from Menomonee Falls High School in 1957, he attended Elmhurst College and the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, but did not receive a degree from either institution.

==Career==
Whitburn worked on record distribution for RCA in the mid 1960s, using his chart statistics to inform radio stations, before founding his own company, Record Research, Inc., in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, in 1970. He put together a team of researchers to examine in detail all of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s music and video charts, and set up a licensing arrangement with &quot;Billboard&quot;. 

Since then, Record Research has published reference books based on data from the various popular music charts and to date has published over 200 books, 50 of which are in the Record Research catalog. His research extends from 1890 to the present and covers many genres. Featuring each recording&#x27;s peak position, date charted, weeks charted, label and information, and trivia on recordings and artists, Whitburn&#x27;s books are used extensively by the entertainment industry (especially radio DJs) and music fans worldwide.

His flagship publication was &quot;Top Pop Singles&quot;, which covers the history of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s popular singles charts, primarily the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The most recent edition, &quot;Top Pop Singles 1955–2018&quot;, was released in June 2019. Whitburn was also the author of the series &quot;Top 40 Hits&quot;, published by Billboard Books. The ninth edition, covering the years 1955 to 2009, was published in 2012. 

==Personal life==
Whitburn was an avid collector of phonograph records, with extensive collections in his underground vaults. His collection included a copy of nearly every 78-rpm record, 45-rpm single, LP, and compact disc to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In 2013, his collection was estimated to contain over 200,000 singles.

Whitburn was married to Frances (née Mudgett), and they had a daughter, Kim. He died at his home in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, at the age of 82 on June 14, 2022. His wife, Frances, died five months later.

<text>The [[GE Aviation|General Electric]] LM6000 is a turboshaft aeroderivative gas turbine engine. The LM6000 is derived from the CF6-80C2 aircraft turbofan. It has additions and modifications designed to make it more suitable for marine propulsion, industrial power generation, and marine power generation use. These include an expanded turbine section to convert thrust into shaft power, supports and struts for mounting on a steel or concrete deck, and reworked controls packages for power generation. It has found wide use including peaking power plants, fast ferries and high speed cargo ship applications.

==Design and development==

The LM6000 provides from either end of the low-pressure rotor system, which rotates at 3,600 rpm. This twin spool design with the low pressure turbine operating at 60 Hz, the dominant electrical frequency in North America, eliminates the need for a conventional power turbine. Its high efficiency and installation flexibility make it ideal also for a wide variety of utility power generation and industrial applications, especially peaker and cogeneration plants. 

GE has several option packages for industrial LM6000s, including &quot;SPRINT&quot; (Spray Inter-Cooled Turbine), water injection (widely known as &quot;NOx water&quot;), STIG (Steam Injected Gas Turbine) technology and DLE (Dry Low Emissions) which utilizes a combustor with premixers to maximize combustion efficiency. The SPRINT option is designed to increase efficiency and power of the turbine, while the water injection, STIG and DLE are for reducing emissions. An alternative form of power augmentation is Evaporative Cooling, which is a water fogging system that sprays a fine mist of water into the inlet air before the air filters. This system is high maintenance and may be replaced by chillers in newer units. The SPRINT system injects demineralized water into the engine either upstream of the low pressure compressor or between the low pressure and high pressure compressors. The water injection system injects water into the primary or secondary fuel nozzle inputs, usually on natural gas fired engines. 

The GE LM6000 PC is rated to provide more than 43 MW with a thermal efficiency of around 42% LHV at ISO conditions. With options, this can be increased to around 50 MW rated power.

==Applications==
Over 1000 LM6000 gas turbines shipped and over 21 million hours of operation. Applications include power generation for combined cycle or peak power. Other applications include combined heat and power for industrial and independent power producers.

<text>The Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program, established in 1989, is an American Kennel Club program to promote responsible dog ownership and to encourage the training of well-mannered dogs. A dog and handler team must take a short behavioral evaluation of less than half an hour; dogs who pass the evaluation earn the Canine Good Citizen certificate, which many people represent after the dog&#x27;s name, abbreviating it as CGC; for example, &quot;Fido, CGC&quot;.

The evaluation consists of ten objectives. All items must be completed satisfactorily or the team fails. Test items include:
*Accepting a friendly stranger.
*Sitting politely for petting.
*Allowing basic grooming procedures.
*Walking on a loose lead.
*Walking through a crowd.
*Sitting and lying down on command and staying in place.
*Coming when called.
*Reacting appropriately to walking by a dog and person.
*Reacting appropriately to distractions.
*Calmly enduring supervised separation from the owner.

Evaluators sometimes combine elements during the actual test. If a dog fails the test initially, owners can continue training with their dog and retake for the test in the future.

If all ten objectives are met, the handler can apply for a certificate and special dog pet tag from the AKC stating that the dog has earned the CGC.

Dogs do not have to be registered with the AKC to earn a CGC, nor do they have to be purebred or, in fact, registered with any canine organization. The goal is to promote responsible dog ownership for all dogs.

Since its inception, the CGC program has become the model for similar programs around the world, is the base for other exams, such as those given for therapy dogs, and is used as a starting point for more advanced dog training.

<text>Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns, sometimes shortened to (The) Panther Burns, is a rock band originally from Memphis, Tennessee, United States, led by Tav Falco. They are best known for having been part of a set of bands emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s who helped nationally popularise the blending of blues, country, and other American traditional music styles with rock music among groups playing in alternative music and punk music venues of the time. The earliest and most renowned of these groups to imbue these styles with expressionist theatricality and primitive spontaneity were The Cramps, largely influenced by rockabilly music. Forming just after them in 1979, Panther Burns drew on obscure country blues music, Antonin Artaud&#x27;s works like &quot;The Theatre and Its Double&quot;, beat poetry, and Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s media theories for their early inspiration. Alongside groups like The Cramps and The Gun Club, Panther Burns is also considered a representative of the Southern Gothic-tinged roots music revival scene.

After forming Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns and making their first recordings in Memphis, the group soon evolved as a rotating crew of additional musicians hailing mostly from Memphis, New York, and New Orleans. Falco moved Paris and later to Vienna, at which time he began working more with European musicians.

== Background and early history ==

In 1977 and 1979, Alex Chilton, attracted by The Cramps&#x27; feral, flamboyant rockabilly style, had brought them to Memphis to record sessions he produced that were later released as &quot;Gravest Hits&quot; and &quot;Songs the Lord Taught Us&quot;. Chilton had initiated the development of a rockabilly and country-tinged alternative rock music scene in Memphis, beginning with his Cramps sessions and his off-kilter &quot;Like Flies on Sherbert&quot; sessions recorded in 1978 through August 1979, following a stint working in New York&#x27;s CBGB punk rock scene as a solo artist after the breakup of Big Star. This New York period had somewhat converted him to a turbulent and chaotic &quot;punk performance ethos&quot;, according to Ross Johnson, writing in &quot;The Memphis Flyer&quot;. The Cramps sessions were the catalysts inspiring some of the young musicians who eventually helped launch Panther Burns to first start performing in public. Future Panther Burns drummer Johnson first performed publicly in a group called The Yard Dogs led by Alex Chilton in the summer of 1978; he made his first recording session appearance on &quot;Like Flies on Sherbert&quot;, drumming and bantering off-the-cuff, comical lyrics to &quot;Baron of Love&quot;. This Chilton album is sometimes panned in retrospective reviews today by writers expecting Big Star&#x27;s chiming guitars and tight, power pop recordings, but at the time the album came out, it was praised by critic Robert Christgau and was influential among young Memphis alternative musicians breaking out of the late 1970s era of disco music and slick, mainstream radio rock and starting to create their own punk rock/garage music scene unrestrained by industry dogma.
Falco had focused his 1970s work on video and photographic documentation of blues performers and local culture in the Memphis area with fellow videographer Randall Lyon, in a partnership they called TeleVista Projects, Inc. Chilton, who first encountered Falco while Lyon and Falco were videotaping some of the &quot;Sherbert&quot; sessions, formally met Falco a couple of months later after witnessing his self-described &quot;Art-Action Happening&quot; during an October 1978 Mud Boy and the Neutrons &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; event in Memphis, at which Falco, untrained in music theory, surprised the audience by blowing a police whistle and chainsawing a guitar on stage halfway through a haywire rendition of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Bourgeois Blues&quot;.

Falco&#x27;s association with Chilton and a small circle of record-collecting musicians helped deepen their shared, longstanding interest in the Blues form. Chilton became inspired to work more with his Blues and Soul roots, after having temporarily been focused more on rockabilly and country music by the late 1970s. At the same time, &quot;The Memphis Flyer&quot; piece viewed the origin of Chilton&#x27;s interest in forming the band as stemming from a desire to find &quot;enthusiastic amateurs to play with&quot; in Memphis, due to his recent exposure to Manhattan&#x27;s budding punk rock music scene. &quot;We were inept and offensive — just what Alex was looking for&quot;, wrote Johnson.

After Chilton completed the &quot;Like Flies on Sherbert&quot; recordings (for which Falco created some cover art graphics), Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns group was formed in February 1979 in Memphis by Falco (vocals, guitar) with Chilton (lead guitar/drums/backing vocals), Ross Johnson (drums), and Eric Hill (synthesiser). In the first couple of years Rick Ivy (trumpet), Jim Dickinson (piano), Vincent Wrenn (synthesizer), Ron Miller (bass), Jim Duckworth (guitar/drums), and Jim Sclavunos (drums), soon joined to play important roles. The group took its name from the Panther Burn plantation south of Greenville, Mississippi. The town, in turn, had taken the name in reference to a wild cat whose raids and nocturnal shrieks had so disturbed area residents in the 19th century that they set a canebrake on fire to keep it at bay after all attempts to trap or kill it had failed; the lore of the elusive animal shaking up a sleepy planters&#x27; hamlet appealed to the band.
The attention Chilton&#x27;s early presence brought the band led to an increased interest in blues music, along with the already emerging Cramps-influenced rockabilly interest, in Memphis&#x27; alternative music scene at that time. Falco&#x27;s initial inclusive approach of mixing enthusiastic players without formal musical training together with professional musicians was in tune with those of noted primitive experimenters Half Japanese and the 1970s East Village alternative music movement of performers like Talking Heads, James Chance and the Contortions, and Klaus Nomi in which visual artists and musicians formed bands together. In the beginning years of the band Falco told writers that because of his unschooled musical background, he represented &quot;the possibility of anyone performing who wants to&quot;. Though confounding the expectations of some listeners, these musicians considered restoring a sense of unbridled enthusiasm to creative work to be more important than conforming to sterile, rigid industry standards, as reflected in the name choice for the small recording label moniker Falco soon adopted to release and co-release the group&#x27;s future recordings: Frenzi.

== Performance and recording notes ==

As interest in the band grew, Panther Burns soon played early gigs in Memphis and other cities, horrifying the host of a Memphis morning television talk show on which they performed. During the talk show performance, Lyon simultaneously encoded and transmitted an experimental, live, slow-scan feed to experimental artist groups OPEN SPACE in Victoria, Center for New Art Activities in New York, and RELAY in San Francisco. Falco explained to the disgusted host that the group was merely a &quot;neo-rumorist orchestra&quot; for a TeleVista experiment, creating what he termed an &quot;anti-environment&quot; to make visible cultural treasures and older, local performers overlooked in the daily environment by mainstream society and the establishment.

The band&#x27;s early happening-styled, so-called &quot;art-action&quot; performances at downtown Memphis cotton lofts at the time frequently included waggish projected images, like the group&#x27;s trademark burning panther image, trained on the musicians, harking back to Velvet Underground-era, psychedelic days of the 1960s. A screen-print artist since the 1970s, Falco promoted many of the early 1980s local live shows by using hand-screen-printed posters which band members and friends helped him create and paste around midtown Memphis. They performed many of these Memphis concerts at local new music dive The Well (later called Antenna Club) with other area bands of the period. They also opened for The Cramps and played double bills with The Gun Club during this period in cities including New Orleans, New York, and Los Angeles. In the early 1980s they performed in an anti-nuclear rally with Allen Ginsberg at The Peppermint Lounge in New York. Reactions to the cacophonous, disjointed, amateurish side of the group&#x27;s early performances varied from enthusiasm to disparaging ridicule. In 1980, New Orleans writer Bunny Matthews, explaining that he enjoyed the group&#x27;s ability to put its audience &quot;through changes&quot;, drolly summed up the experience: &quot;No one is ever going to attend a Panther Burns recital and leave with mixed feelings&quot;.

&quot;Behind the Magnolia Curtain&quot;, the group&#x27;s first album, was recorded in 1981 and released on the British Rough Trade Records label in 1982. The album featured on some tracks, including &quot;Bourgeois Blues&quot;, an appearance by a small, marching drum corps that included blues artist Jessie Mae Hemphill, who had participated in her grandfather&#x27;s Northern Mississippi Fife and drum corps groups as a child. The contrast between the strong, military beats of the drum corps dueling with Falco&#x27;s occasionally out-of-sync vocals resulted in the wild, blues-rock chaos of songs on the album like the frenetic &quot;Bourgeois Blues&quot;.

&quot;We were thrown off quite a few stages during that period&quot;, wrote Johnson. &quot;Though we initially enjoyed the effect we had on club audiences, somewhere along the way we tried to clean up our sound&quot;. The recording was followed by the slicker rockabilly revival style of &quot;Blow Your Top&quot;, without Chilton&#x27;s participation, and in 1984, the Jim Dickinson-produced &quot;Sugar Ditch Revisited&quot; album was recorded, featuring a more subdued playing style by Chilton along with New Orleans bassist René Coman. That year, following a brief tour opening for The Clash before irritable college audiences impatient for the main act, Chilton stopped touring regularly with the group to resume his increasingly minimalist solo touring and recording career. Chilton&#x27;s restrained, evolving solo style was beginning to diverge from his previously fiery, strident Panther Burns guitar style that had often featured reverb and feedback; however, he continued to produce several of their later albums.

===Transition to less primitive performance style===

Since the more refined productions of &quot;Sugar Ditch Revisited&quot; and 1987&#x27;s &quot;The World We Knew&quot;, the band has concentrated less on raw, primitive sounds than in its early years. The group has developed into a combo working more with the feel and subtleties of the genres it explores, including tango and roots-oriented styles, with occasional forays into deranged, garage blues, as heard in &quot;Panther Phobia&quot; or in the frenzied guitar work performed in some of the 1980s and 1990s live shows by New Orleans musician George Reinecke, as also heard on &quot;Red Devil&quot;. The main constant in the varied work remains Falco&#x27;s provocative vocals and wordplay.

Over the years, the group has recorded and toured with different lineups featuring a mix of energetic, alternative musicians working at times alongside seasoned rock and roll, soul, and jazz veterans to create its howling sounds, always centered around the presence of vocalist Falco. Panther Burns occasionally opened for major punk rock acts in the 1980s, appearing on double bills with some of their older heroes like Cordell Jackson, Jessie Mae Hemphill, and rockabilly great Charlie Feathers in the same time period, but usually headlined its own gigs at small clubs across the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

Venues the group has played at during its career have ranged from no-wave clubs in the East Village to New Jersey hardcore punk pits, music heritage festivals, alternative rock clubs, the Ottawa Bluesfest, Central Park Conservatory, and many others. In the early 2000s, the group began to play mostly in Europe due to Falco&#x27;s relocation there. A 2006 minitour of Europe and the United States featured the main lineup from the previous several years performing with Falco: Roman drummer Giovanna Pizzorno with Parisians Grégoire Cat on guitar and Laurent Lo on bass.

Panther Burns have released a number of recordings through the years on indie rock labels like New Rose Records (France), In the Red, Au Go Go Records (Australia), Last Call Records (France), Triple X, Upstart, and Sympathy for the Record Industry. The band&#x27;s recordings have included raucous, yet controlled studio albums produced by Chilton and sometimes Dickinson; a live 10th anniversary show album was produced in 1989 by longtime group guitarist Ron Easley, followed the next year by a studio album, &quot;Return of the Blue Panther&quot;, produced by former group bassist Coman. Coman, a jazz musician who leads The Iguanas rock group of New Orleans, recorded the album with guitarist Reinecke at the mixing board.

The group has also recorded a tango-oriented album, a live concert mini-album, and a lo-fi studio album with Doug Easley of Easley McCain Recording. Among the group&#x27;s early recording engineers were Ardent Studios&#x27; John Hampton, as well as former Sun Records session musicians Stan Kessler and Roland Janes of Phillips Recording.

In August–September 2014, Falco recorded an album in Rome, Italy&#x27;s Exit Studios. The album, titled &quot;Command Performance,&quot; was produced by Panther Burns guitarist Mario Monterosso and released in 2015 on the UK label Twenty Stone Blatt Records, with distribution by Proper Records.

Also in 2014, Stag-O-Lee Records (Germany) compiled a double album of Falco&#x27;s favorites from his personal music collection, released as &quot;Tav Falco&#x27;s Wonderful World Of Musical &amp; Exotic Obscurities&quot;. Falco contributed to the varied artists album a liner notes essay and a Panther Burns song called &quot;Real Cool Trash,&quot; which &quot;The Wire&quot; likened to &quot;the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll energy&quot; of The Cramps. &quot;The Wire&quot; described the album styles as ranging from rockabilly to &quot;far-flung genres&quot; that include &quot;tangos, waltzes, and concertina music.&quot;

In 2022, Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns undertook an extensive US Tour, which began in August 25 in San Francisco and featured dates in 34 US cities. The setlist included songs from throughout the Panther Burns&#x27; career, including songs from &quot;Command Performance&quot; and &quot;Cabaret of Daggers&quot; as well as covers of songs by Charlie Feathers, Lead Belly, Alex Chilton and others. Falco&#x27;s producer Mario Monterosso backed Falco on guitar for the tour, along with bassist Giuseppe Sangirardi and drummer Walter Brunetti.

== Musical style ==

According to the band, Panther Burns is &quot;a Southern Gothic, psychedelic country band influenced by Memphis music styles&quot;. The original band lineup featured two guitars, synthesizer, and drums, later usually omitting keyboards or synthesizers at live shows. The group&#x27;s somewhat experimental recordings have embraced and deconstructed a number of influences and genres, including rockabilly, blues rock and Southern Gothic.

With his signature Höfner fuzz-tone guitar and a stage presence characterized by his Argentine-styled pompadour, pencil moustache, smoking jacket, and urbane manner, Falco infused his shows with theatrical antics and a reverence for the originators of country blues and rockabilly. The band&#x27;s assorted song subjects and album photography themes have included Memphis scenery, Carroll Cloar&#x27;s &quot;Panther Bourne&quot; painting, the occasional reference to historical figures like American rampage murderer Charles Starkweather, motorcycle imagery, denizens of Memphis neighborhoods, tango imagery, and blithe introspection, among other themes.

Falco&#x27;s treatment of the blues classic &quot;Bourgeois Blues&quot; adds a line from Ginsberg&#x27;s famous beat poem &quot;Howl&quot;. In a 1984 interview discussing his anti-environment concept and music, he said that many outstanding, but lesser known blues and rockabilly artists were &quot;treated like the idiot wind&quot;. Similarly, he continued, &quot;the beat writers and theorists like Antonin Artaud were treated like they were crazy. It wasn&#x27;t until he died that everyone realized he was a genius&quot;. Two of his originals, &quot;Agitator Blues&quot; and &quot;Panther Phobia Manifesto&quot;, evinced playful humor and a left-leaning, Utopian anarchist political stance. In &quot;Panther Phobia Manifesto&quot;, Falco referenced lines from influences as disparate as William S. Burroughs, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Rod Serling, French psychedelic band The Dum Dum Boys, and Dadaist poet Louis Aragon, in wishing a &quot;huge firedamp explosion&quot; to closed-minded members of society who blindly follow the dictates of the establishment. Proclaiming that everywhere the Panther Burns go, they are greeted with derision, he riffed from Aragon, &quot;Laugh your fill, the Panther Burns are the ones who always hold out a hand to the enemy&quot;.

The group&#x27;s wide-ranging styles have included Argentine tango music, country music, rockabilly, R&amp;B, soul music, novelty tunes, early rock and roll, country blues, and pop standards of the 1950s and 1960s like Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;The World We Knew&quot;, among others. Set lists have included mutated covers of songs originally performed by such diverse artists as J. Blackfoot, Doc Pomus, Bobby Lee Trammell, Gene Pitney, Reverend Horton Heat, Jessie Mae Hemphill, R. L. Burnside, Mack Rice, and Allen Page (of the small 1950s Moon Records label helmed by early rock-and-roll producer/songwriter Cordell Jackson), among others.

The earliest description the band gave itself on a concert poster read simply: &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot;. Media confusion in categorizing led the band to eventually invent its own self-descriptive terms, such as &quot;panther music&quot; and &quot;backwoods ballroom&quot;, also at times calling its tumultuous performance style &quot;art damage&quot;.

<text>Gustavo Antonio &quot;Tav&quot; Falco is an American-born filmmaker, actor, musician, author, photographer, and dancer. Falco has fronted the experimental band Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns since 1979, and founded a parallel solo career that incorporates other styles such as cabaret, tango, and vocal jazz. He has directed one feature film and numerous short films, and has played minor acting roles in motion pictures filmed in both North America and Europe. He is the author of two books, one a psychography of the city of Memphis, and the other a collection of his photography.

==Biography==
Falco was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a family of Italian descent but grew up in rural southwest Arkansas between Whelen Springs and Gurdon. After studying theater and film at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Falco moved to Memphis in 1973. In the mid-1970s, he started the nonprofit Televista &quot;art-action&quot; video group with fellow Arkansas poet/performance artist/videographer Randall Lyon to create art and to document local musicians and artists. While with Televista, Falco worked with and trained in photography and filmmaking under Memphis color photographer William Eggleston.

In 1978, Alex Chilton teamed up with Falco after being impressed by Falco&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Bourgeois Blues&quot; at The Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, which culminated in the chainsawing of an electric guitar. The two founded the self-styled &quot;art damage&quot; rock and roll band Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns in 1979. The group was named after lore surrounding a plantation in Mississippi. The Panther Burns&#x27; debut album, &quot;Behind The Magnolia Curtain&quot;, was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis and released by Rough Trade Records. A December 3, 1980, session recorded at Sam Phillips Recording Service was released in 1992 on Marilyn Records as &quot;The Unreleased Sessions.&quot; Falco moved to New York in 1981, and released his official follow-up album, &quot;Blow Your Top,&quot; on Chris Stein&#x27;s Animal Records imprint, which was distributed by Chrysalis Records.

Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2019 with a tour dubbed the &quot;40th Anniversary Howl&quot;, with its prime show taking place May 21 of that year in Memphis at Lafayette&#x27;s Music Room.

Falco devoted portions of his musical career to highlighting traditional regional artists from Memphis and Mississippi who had not gained media attention. He filmed a black &amp; white short film of blues artist R.L. Burnside performing at Brotherhood Sportsmen&#x27;s Lodge in Como, Mississippi, on September 28, 1974. After assembling The Panther Burns, Falco performed and collaborated with legacy rockabilly and blues performers such as Charlie Feathers, James Luther Dickinson, and Cordell Jackson. His photography was used for the Charlie Feathers album &quot;Honky Tonk Man&quot; (New Rose Records, 1988).

Falco would also promote and work with lesser-known regional contemporaries. His record imprint, Frenzi Records, released a 1986 compilation of area artists entitled &quot;Swamp Surfing in Memphis,&quot; as well as a 1988 studio EP by female-led group The Hellcats. These records received respective international distribution from Au Go Go Records (Australia) and New Rose Records (France).

In 2014, Falco compiled a double album of some of his favorite tracks from his music collection, &quot;Tav Falco&#x27;s Wild &amp; Exotic World of Musical Obscurities&quot;, which was released on Stag-O-Lee Records. The album set included a cover song by The Panther Burns and liner notes by Falco.

In the 1990s, Falco relocated from the United States to Paris, and then to Vienna, where he lived for nearly two decades. In January 2022, he located to Bangkok, where he currently resides. Often Falco has claimed his main artistic purpose is &quot;to stir up the dark waters of the unconscious.&quot;

In a 2019 interview, Falco described himself as a &quot;Utopian anarchist&quot;.

===Work in films===
====As filmmaker====
Starting in the 1970s, Falco created a number of short films on varying topics focusing on &quot;underground&quot; art-actions and cultural assets around the mid-American South. The Cinémathèque Française in Paris accepted and archived six of Falco&#x27;s short films into its permanent collection. Among the titles archived are &quot;Masque of Hôtel Orient,&quot; &quot;Born Too Late&quot;, &quot;Helene of Memphis&quot;, &quot;Memphis Beat&quot;, &quot;Shadetree Mechanic,&quot; and &quot;71 Salvage&quot;. A selection of Falco&#x27;s short films were shown in a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française in 2006, with Falco himself in attendance.
&quot;Urania Descending,&quot; the first feature film directed by Falco, was completed in 2014 and released in 2016 by Lamplighter Films. The film consists of portions of what was intended to be a film trilogy. As of February 2024, Falco completed the full &quot;Urania&quot; &quot;Trilogy.&quot; Avant-premieres were held at key cinematheques in America and in Europe including a special event at Cinéma Saint-André des Arts in Paris presented by avant-garde cineaste, F.J. Ossang.

In addition to the Cinémathèque Française, Falco&#x27;s film work has been screened at The Horse Hospital, London; the David Lynch-designed Silencio Cinema, Paris; Anthology Film Archives, New York; Roxie Theater, San Francisco; Oxford Film Festival, Mississippi; Austria Film Archiv Metrokino, Vienna; and by the American Cinematheque in the Steven Spielberg Cinema at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.

====As actor====
Falco appeared as an actor with minor roles in the feature films &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, &quot;A nagy postarablás&quot; (&quot;The Great Post Office Robbery&quot;), &quot;Highway 61,&quot; &quot;Downtown 81,&quot; and &quot;Wayne County Rambling.&quot; 

&quot;Downtown 81&quot; was shot in New York in 1981 and was directed by Edo Bertoglio. The film starred artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and featured Debbie Harry, James Chance, Arto Lindsay, and August Darnell in supporting roles. Falco was featured in a cameo role shot on Super 16mm film, where he created and then recited improvised dialogue with Basquiat. Basquiat hated the dialogue so much he walked off the set. Initially abandoned, the film was released by Metrograph Pictures in 2000.

After taking an interest in tango dancing in the 1990s and devoting time to studying the dance in Buenos Aires, Falco appeared as a &quot;tanguero&quot; in the 2003 film &quot;Dans Le Rouge du Couchant.&quot;

===As author===
Falco has collaborated with Erik Morse, an American underground author, music writer and journalist, on a two-volume book series about the city of Memphis entitled &quot;Mondo Memphis&quot;. Falco&#x27;s book, &quot;Ghosts Behind The Sun: Splendor, Enigma, and Death/Mondo Memphis: Volume 1&quot;, is a 450-page encyclopedic history and psychography of Memphis, beginning well before the Civil War and moving forward to more recent autobiographical accounts set in that city. Morse&#x27;s &quot;Bluff City Underground/Mondo Memphis: Volume 2&quot; &quot;roman noir&quot; follows a West Coast graduate student and his encounters with a Memphis secret society.

In 2015, Falco&#x27;s book of photography, a collection of black &amp; white images of the American South entitled &quot;Iconography of Chance: 99 Photographs of the Evanescent South&quot;, was published by Elsinore Press and distributed by University of Chicago Press.

===As solo musician===

After moving to Vienna, Falco took an interest in tango, cabaret, and similar continental musical styles. The 1995 Tav Falco &amp; The Panther Burns album &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot; introduced these influences to his music. In 1996, he released two 10&quot; LP releases, &quot;Disappearing Angels&quot; and &quot;2 Sides of Tav Falco,&quot; under the &quot;Tav Falco&quot; name.

In 2016, Falco released the holiday-themed album &quot;A Tav Falco Christmas&quot; on the Los Angeles-based record label ORG Music. Recorded at Sam Phillips Recording Service, the album featured Mike Watt on bass, and was produced by guitarist Mario Monterosso. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;gloriously demented enough to act as a tonic for anyone who can&#x27;t bear the thought of another dose of sugary sentimentality.&quot; 

In a 2018 interview with Adam J. Harmer of the British indie rock group Fat White Family, Falco stated, &quot;I&#x27;m getting away from the rock and roll world to get a little peace of mind.&quot; In April of that year, Falco recorded the sessions that would become the album &quot;Cabaret of Daggers&quot; at Terminal 2 Studio in Rome, with Mario Monterosso producing once again. Two of the album&#x27;s songs, including the anthemic &quot;Red Vienna,&quot; are Falco originals. The remainder includes selections from the Great American Songbook such as &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and &quot;Born to Be Blue,&quot; and veers far enough away from The Panther Burns&#x27; signature sound that Falco opted to present it as a solo album, despite Panther Burns members being featured prominently on the album. &quot;Cabaret of Daggers&quot; was released by ORG Music on limited edition yellow vinyl on Record Store Day on November 23, and on black vinyl and digital formats on November 30. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine stated that the album &quot;conjures up a potent mix of blues, jazz and tango rhythms in which 1920s Vienna café culture seamlessly rubs shoulders with Beale Street juke joints,&quot; and rated the album four stars out of five.

<text>Police Tero Football Club (), formerly known as BEC-Tero Sasana, is a Thai professional football club based in Lak Si, Bangkok. The club finished runners-up in the inaugural AFC Champions League competition in 2003. BEC-Tero Sasana Football Club merged with Police United Football Club in the 2017 season and changed its official name to Police Tero Football Club in the 2018 season.

The club has won 2 Thai League 1 titles, 1 Kor Royal Cup and 1 Thai League Cup. They were also the finalist in the 2002–03 AFC Champions League campaign.

==History==
===Establishment of the club===
The team was established in 1992. It was previously known as Sasana Witthaya School team and was founded by Worawi Makudi. The first football match the team entered was in Division 3 of the football royal cup in 1993. In 1994, the team played in Division 2 of the football royal cup. In 1995, the team played in Division 1 of the football royal cup and in 1996, the team entered the Thai League for the first time. It was during this year, that Mr. Worawi Makudi and Mr. Brian L. Marcar, managing director of BEC-TERO Entertainment Public Co. Ltd., joined hands and renamed the team as Tero Sasana Football Club. The team was placed in 12th position among 18 teams in the Thai League.

In 1997, Tero Sasana Football Club also played in the Thai League and this time was placed in fifth place. Later in 1998, BEC World Public Company Limited supported the Tero Sasana Football Club and changed the team&#x27;s name to BEC-Tero Sasana. The team won the third place when they played the Thai League. They were also one of the eight final teams to enter the final round of the Thai FA Cup.

In 1999, the team entered the Thai League and again won third place. In the same year, they were among the final teams in the Thai FA Cup.

===The Thai giant and the final Asian Champions League===
2000 was a very eventful year for BEC-Tero Sasana. The team won its first championship award by winning the Thai League. It also received the championship award for the King&#x27;s Cup.

In 2001, BEC-Tero Sasana was able to keep its championship and won the Thai Premier League for the second consecutive year. This greatly increased the fan base. In that year, the club participated in POMIS Cup in Maldives.

The club&#x27;s success continued for a few years and culminated with finishing runner-up in the 2002–03 AFC Champions League. The team were put alongside Asian heavyweights Kashima Antlers, Daejeon Citizen, and Shanghai Shenhua in Group A of the 2002–03 AFC Champions League; a group which they would top with 7 points. BEC-Tero Sansana then faced Uzbekistan&#x27;s Pakhtakor in the semi-final and defeated them 3–2 on aggregate, before losing to Al Ain in the two-legged final, 2–1.

===Golden Generation===
In 2012, the club appointed Robert Procureur, former general manager of Muangthong United, to be the new Director of Football and appointed Andrew Ord as the club manager. Them built up a great team by pushing up many young players such as Adisorn Promrak, Peerapat Notchaiya, Tanaboon Kesarat, Chanathip Songkrasin, Narubadin Weerawatnodom, Tristan Do, Chenrop Samphaodi, Jaturong Pimkoon and the fan called &quot;Golden Generation&quot; and the club signed former Japan national team player Daiki Iwamasa that was the important to help the team win the Thai League Cup Trophy in 2014 from Daiki Iwamasa and Georgie Welcome&#x27;s goals, its first trophy in 12 years.

===Decline and financial ruin===
After the club was relegated in 2016 (Saraburi was out of the Thai league due to money problems so the club was placed in the place of Saraburi), club president Brian L. Marcar sold the team to Inspire Entertainment, the owner of Muangthong United. Robert Procureur quit and star players such as Peerapat Notchaiya, Tanaboon Kesarat, Chanathip Songkrasin and Tristan Do joined various clubs, such as Muangthong United.

===Merging: BEC-Tero Sasana and Police United===
In 2017, the club were taken over by the Royal Thai Police, who merged them with their own club, Police United. The club name change was not recognized in 2017, so in 2018, the club changed their name to Police Tero Football Club.

====Return to the Thai League 1====
In October 2019, under head coach Rangsan Viwatchaichok, Police Tero were runners-up in the 2019 Thai League 2 and were promoted to the 2020 Thai League 1.

====Failed to takeover====
On 6 November 2023, Police Tero held a press conference to launch a new investment group, a group of three Cambodian royal princess, with an investment of ฿200 million and a 49% stake in the club. But in the end the takeover of the club was unsuccessful because the new owners were unable to declare the origin of the money and were unable to bring the money into the country.

==Stadium and locations==
Police Tero currently resides at the Boonyachinda Stadium since 2017. The stadium is available to hold up to 3,500 capacity.

<text>Al-Hilal Saudi Football Club (), simply known as Al-Hilal is a professional multi-sports club based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Their football team competes in the Saudi Pro League. In Arabic, Al-Hilal means &quot;the Crescent Moon&quot;. Founded on 16 October 1957, Al-Hilal are one of three teams to have participated in all seasons of the Saudi Pro League since its establishment in 1976. They are the most decorated club in Asia, winning 70 official trophies. 

In domestic competitions, Al-Hilal have won a record 19 league titles, a record 13 Crown Prince Cup titles, a record seven Saudi Federation Cup titles, eleven King Cup titles, a record five Super Cup titles, as well as the Saudi Founder&#x27;s Cup. Continentally, Al-Hilal have won a record eight Asian Football Confederation trophies — the AFC Champions League in 1991, 2000, 2019 and 2021, the Asian Cup Winners Cup in 1997 and 2002, and the Asian Super Cup in 1997, 2000. 

Internationally, Al-Hilal made multiple appearances in the FIFA Club World Cup,
They were runners-ups in the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, having become the first Asian club from the non-host nation to reach the FIFA Club World Cup final. In September 2009, Al-Hilal was awarded Best Asian Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS. Al-Hilal has a market value of €242.5 million as of 2024, the highest in Saudi Arabia.

== History ==
The idea of establishing the club began when the ranks of the Youth Club witnessed in 1957 a serious division among its leaders, which prompted Mr. Abdul Rahman bin Saeed to resign from the presidency of the Youth Club in that year, and many left with him, including a number of prominent players.

The opportunity was ripe for the establishment of a new club at the first-class level to serve Saudi sports, and this was already done when a new club was established on 15 October 1957 in Riyadh. The club&#x27;s name lasted for only one year before it was changed to its current name on 3 December 1958 by King Saud. He changed the name after he attended a tournament that was contested between the Olympic Club, Al Shabab, Al Riyadh and Al-Kawkab clubs. As soon as the club&#x27;s establishment, Al-Hilal enjoyed not only grassroots support but also royal attention.

After spending their formative years building a squad, the club made their first mark by lifting the King&#x27;s Cup trophy in 1961. Al-Hilal won the King&#x27;s Cup again in 1964, with a penalty shootout victory over two-time Asian champions Al Ittihad. The club also won the Crown Prince Cup in 1963–64.

The club were the inaugural winners when the Saudi Premier League came into existence in the 1976–77 season. Al Hilal also won the league title in 1978–79.

With the success, a number of players and coaches from outside Saudi Arabia joined the club in the 1970s, including Brazilian legends Mario Zagallo and Rivellino.

=== Sustained success (1980–1990) ===
After the establishment of the Saudi Premier League in the late 70&#x27;s and with Al Hilal winning the competition twice including the inaugural edition. Ampaiai in the eighties brought about a new dawn of success to the riyadh giants, with group of talented homegrown players such as the charismatic figurehead defender Saleh Al-Nu&#x27;eimeh who captained both Al Hilal and the Saudi National Football Team, together with the promotion of the extremely gifted player maker Yousuf Al-Thunayan and the young and prolific forward Sami Al-Jaber. The club went on to win four league titles as well as four kings cup titles in ten years, two of those being season double&#x27;s. Al Hilal were the runners-up in the Asian club Championship twice. They were second after the round-robin in the final round in 1986. They reached the final the following year in 1987, but Yomiuri were crowned the champion automatically as Al Hilal were unable to field a team for the final due to nine of the starting players being chosen for the Saudi team&#x27;s preparation camp that clashed with the date fixed for the first leg.

=== Continental dominance (1991–2002) ===
The 1990s marked a shift in the dominant teams challenging for the title, such as the emergence of Al Shabab as a new contender and force in the league. As well as the resurgence of bitter rivals Al Nassr and Al Ittihad made the league become contested and shared between the four, Al Hilal achieved three titles during this period (1995–96, 1997–98, 2001–02). The club continued to churn out talent from its academy with players such as Nawaf Al-Temyat, Mohammed Al-Shalhoub, Abdallah Al-Jamaan, Ahmad Al-Dokhi as well as Zambian defender Elijah Litana. Al Hilal&#x27;s continental spoil&#x27;s during this period defined the clubs identity, decadence and standing in the Asian continent for years to come. The first of which came in 1991 when the club won their first Asian title, the Asian Club Championship, beating Iranian club Esteghlal in penalties in the final. In 1997 the Asian Cup Winners Cup and Asian super cup were also obtained. The club won the Asian Club Championship again in 1999–2000, when they scored an equaliser in the 89th minute and won the match against Japanese club Júbilo Iwata in the extra-time, with the final being one of the most exciting and competitive in the competition&#x27;s history; A super cup was also achieved in the same year. Finally the last of the Asian titles to be secured in this era was the 2002 Cup Winners Cup.

=== League duopoly (2003–2011) ===
At the turn of the century the historic rivalry between Al Hilal and Al Ittihad had reached levels never seen before in Saudi football. Historically, since their first meeting, Al Hilal/Al Ittihad matches have always been aggressive and passion filled spectacles that drew huge crowds due to both teams being from the two major Saudi cities of Riyadh and Jeddah. Each team represented different cities, backgrounds and values. Al Hilal is based in Riyadh the capital of Saudi Arabia, in addition to having traditional Najdi values the club is most commonly supported by the upper and middle class and also enjoyed royal attention. While on the other hand, Al-Ittihad is based in the port city of Jeddah and is commonly supported by the lower and middle class as well as non-Saudi natives giving it the nickname &quot;the people&#x27;s club&quot;. Both teams dominated this era of Saudi football history. Al Hilal won the title/s in (2004–05, 2007–08, 2009–10, 2010–11). Al Ittihad&#x27;s golden generation in this period of time equaled Al Hilal&#x27;s two AFC Champions League titles, as well as winning the league title/s in (2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2008–09). This resulted in both teams exchanging winner and runner-up positions almost every season in the league for ten years with the exception of two seasons.

The pinnacle moment of the era was in the 2007–08 season when Al Ittihad was leading the table the whole season with Al Hilal always right behind in second, the final match day pitted both teams against each other in the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Stadium in Jeddah with Al-Ittihad needing a draw at the minimum to clinch the league title at home. Al Ittihad were the clear favourites due to their much superior quality and home advantage. The match began with Al Ittihad leading in possession and attacking opportunities but to no avail. In the 49th minute Ahmed Al-Fraidi crossed the ball from the edge of the box, to which Yasser Al-Qahtani skimmed with a header to the right bottom corner of the goal giving Al Hilal a 1–0 lead four minutes after half time. Al-Ittihad frantically tried to equalise with an abundance of shots but Mohamed Al-Deayea goalkeeping heroics the whole match denied them the goal they so desperately needed, and even more so after Al Qahtani&#x27;s goal. The referee finally blew the whistle and Al Hilal were crowned the league champions in Jeddah, and under whose management of Cosmin Olăroiu was coupled with the Crown Prince Cup finishing the season with a double. The league is commonly known and remembered with the nickname (Arabic: شعره ياسر) which roughly translates to &quot;Yasser&#x27;s hair&quot; due to the winning goal being scored when the ball skimmed by Yasser&#x27;s header veering the ball towards the goal. What made the occasion even more special is that the opposite outcome happened the previous season when Al Ittihad clinched the league title in the last minutes.

Before the beginning of the 2009–10 season Eric Gerets was hired as the new Al Hilal manager. Under his management Al Hilal tactically adopted a very attacking style, combining an already talented local group of players with star foreign players such as the versatile South Korean right back Lee Young-pyo, the powerful and dominant defensive midfielder Mirel Rădoi, the speedy Swedish winger Christian Wilhelmsson and the technically gifted Brazilian attacking midfielder Thiago Neves. This blend of local and foreign talent guided by a tactically astute manager dominated the league and were crowned champions with three games to spare, a crown prince cup was also won in the same season. In the following 2010–11 season Al Hilal continued to dominate domestically and continentally until their semi-final exit from the 2010 AFC Champions League, shortly following their exit Eric Gerets left to become the new head coach of the Morocco national football team. After Gerets&#x27;s departure Gabriel Calderon took over as head coach of Al Hilal and finished the updated 14 team league as undefeated champion with 19 wins and 7 draws, becoming the second team to achieve this feat after Al Ettifaq. The season also finished with a double as the Crown Prince Cup was defended.

=== Struggle at the continental stage (2012–2018) ===
After their back-to-back league titles and generally consistent success in the domestic front, Al Hilal always seemed to come up short in their continental pursuit since their last triumph in the 1999–2000 campaign. Adding to an already aging local core and departing key players, Al Hilal was in a transition period to rebuild the team that was able to challenge domestically and in the Champions league. Al Hilal reached the final of AFC Champions League in 2014, 14 years after their last appearance in the final. This time they faced Western Sydney Wanderers. The Australian club won 1–0 on aggregate with some very questionable refereeing decisions by Yuichi Nishimura (what the fans claim). During this period of time Al Hilal was not able to win the league title for five seasons beginning from the 2011–12 to the 2015–16 season, finishing runner up in three of those seasons, and was only able to achieve five cup titles: Crown Prince cup (2011–12, 2012–13, 2015–16), King cup (2015) and a Super cup (2015) Against arch rivals Al-Nasser held at Loftus Road Stadium, in London.

At the start of the 2016–17 season a string of bad results caused Gustavo Matosas to be sacked and replaced by Ramón Díaz. Diaz&#x27;s reorganised the tactical shape and style of play in which the team was engaging with as well as the conditioning his players to quickly grasp his philosophy. Taking advantage of the fact that throughout the generations Al Hilal&#x27;s success largely came from academy players as well as key signings, which the squad already possessed but the group was not in sync or able to reach their true potential. Players such as goalkeeper Abdullah Al-Mayouf was brought back From Al-Ahli because of his distribution abilities, right and left backs Yasser Al-Shahrani and Mohammed Al-Breik were good in chance creation and also in attacking output. Salem Al-Dawsari was talented but unpolished player when he was promoted to the first team in 2011, but has matured to become a key player. These player became the spine of the team and an integral part of Al Hilal squad for years to come. The managerial replacement radically changed the team&#x27;s performance by playing possession-based attacking football which the aforementioned players turned out to be very adept to. Al Hilal finished the season as champions of the league and King cup with the former being achieved with record points in a season.

The following season continued in the same rhythm with Al Hilal leading in the domestic league and reaching the 2017 AFC Champions League Final. But they ultimately lost to the Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds 1–2 in aggregate after Carlos Eduardo suffered an ACL tear in the first minutes of the first leg, and Omar Kharbin suffered an injury in the second leg. The team slumped mentally after the defeat and began a series of subpar performances which lead to their exit from the next edition&#x27;s group stage which was their first time leaving the group stage since 2010. Ramón Díaz was sacked on 21 February 2018 and he was replaced Juan Brown as caretaker until the end of the season, he managed to salvage the season by winning Al Hilal their 15th domestic league title.

=== Return to continental dominance and worldwide appearances (2019–present) ===

The 2018–19 season saw drastic changes to the league with an increase in the number of clubs from 14 to 16, as well as the increase of foreign players to 8. This season saw the arrival of Bafetimbi Gomis, Andre Carrillo and Sebastian Giovinco managed by Jorge Jesus. The season started very well winning the first nine matches of the league, but when a new president was appointed Jorge Jesus was sacked on 30 January with no specified reason even though he had won 20 matches, was leading the league by 9 points and had won the 2018 Super Cup. Things started to go downhill from there, by the end of the season Al Hilal ended up as runner-up in the league by one point to Al-Nassr and runner-up in the 2018–19 Arab Club Champions Cup, lost out to Al-Taawoun in the semi-final of the 2019 King Cup. Mohammed bin Faisal resigned as president on the 1st of May before the season ended.

Fahad bin Nafil was elected president for a four-year term. Răzvan Lucescu was appointed as the new manager, several players that were deemed unneeded were released. South Korean defender Jang Hyun-soo was signed alongside Colombian international Gustavo Cuéllar. The 2019–2020 season started well and Al Hilal was leading the table almost the whole season with Al Nassr being the only other club in the title race with Al Hilal, nearing final rounds of the season Al Hilal thrashed Al Nassr 4–1 to end their title hopes as we&#x27;ll finishing the season as champions and setting a new points record of 72. During the 2019 Champions League campaign Al Hilal produced a dominating and exciting performance in the competition to reach the final midway through the season. The first Champions league match of the season was against Al Ahli in the round of 16 Al Hilal won 4–1 away With Gomis scoring a hattrick, and lost 0–1 at home, Al Hilal qualified to the next stage with an aggregate score of 4–2. The quarter final matched Al Hilal against local rivals Al-Ittihad, the first match ended in a 0–0 stalemate away while the second match Al Hilal won 3–1 at home with memorable performances from Salem, Carrillo and Giovinco, Al Hilal qualified to the semi-final with an aggregate score of 3–1. In the semi-final Al Hilal was against their toughest opponent in the competition Al Sadd, in the away match Al Hilal won 4–1 in Doha while the opposing team player Abdulkarim Hassan was sent off. In the return leg at home in Riyadh, Al Sadd was able to turn around the score by scoring four goals to two, and in the last minute of the game they were awarded a free kick at the edge of the box and needed to score one more goal to go through to the final, but Abdullah Al-Mayouf saved the ball and the original time finished with Al Hilal winning 6–5 on aggregate, Al Hilal qualified to their third final in 5 years. After trying and failing to win on two previous finals in 2014 and 2017. They played against the Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds, to whom they lost to in the final two years before. They successfully took a revenge and won 3–0 on aggregate 1–0 at home and 2–0 away, ending a nineteen-year wait for the Asian crown, Bafetimbi Gomis was also the tournaments top scorer and MVP. With both the 2019–20 Saudi Professional League as well as the 2019 AFC Champions League titles secured Al Hilal had one more title to win to wrap up the treble. Al Hilal reached the 2019–20 King Cup final to face Al Nassr who had not won the cup since 1990, Al Hilal won by 2–1 to complete the historic Treble.

In the 2021 AFC Champions league, Al Hilal had barely managed to qualify to the knockout stages of the competition. In the round of 16 They faced Iranian team Esteghlal in Dubai and won the match 2–0, in the quarter finals they faced another Iranian team Persepolis whom they defeated 3–0 to qualify to the next stage. In the semi-final stage Al Hilal came up against their perennial rivals Al Nassr which was dubbed as the match of the century due to the long-standing animosity these historic rivals had for each other. This was the first time both teams would face each other in this competition, Further more Al Nassr had never won the AFC Champions league before and Al Hilal needed one more title to be the AFC Champions league outright record title holders. The stakes of the game were so high that the tension was felt in the city of Riyadh weeks before the game. The game finished with Al Hilal winning 2–1 against Al Nassr to reach the final in addition to bragging rights for many years to come. Al Hilal reached the final in 2021 to face South Korean club Pohang Steelers, both clubs had held a record of three AFC Champions League titles. Al Hilal came up on top to score the first goal 16 seconds after the match began.

Al Hilal later faced UEFA Champions League winners Chelsea but lost 1–0, Al Hilal ended up in the 4th position overall in the tournament.In September 2022, Al Hilal offered Cristiano Ronaldo a two-year contract worth €242 million. However, Ronaldo rejected the proposal, calling it &quot;obscene&quot;. The reports of the offer first surfaced in July 2022, but the Saudi club name was not known. The President of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, Yasser Al Misehal said he would like to see Ronaldo play in Saudi, but that it &quot;won&#x27;t happen before January unfortunately&quot;. However, he signed up for rivals Al Nassr instead on 1 January 2023.

The Asian Football Confederation decided to change the competition schedule from an all-year-round (spring-to-autumn) schedule to an autumn-to-spring schedule from next season onwards, despite the 2022 season actually being held from April 2022 to May 2023. Due to this decision Al Hilal had 9-month hiatus from the end of the group stage to the first knockout game, in February 2023 Al Hilal faced Emarati Shabab Al Ahli in the round of 16 whom they defeated 3–1. Three days later in the quarter finals Al Hilal faced Iran&#x27;s Foolad in a highly physical match that ended in a 1–0 win with Marega scoring a goal in 87th minute. After advancing to the semi-final stage Al Hilal was pitted against Qatari Al Duhail, some pundits claimed before the game was played that Al-Duhail would easily reach the final in particular Nashat Akram who claimed that the match was over before it started and that Al-Duhail already booked their place in the final.

== Crest ==
In 2022, Al Hilal Football Club introduced a major redesign of their logo, signaling a shift from their previous emblem to a more modern and simplified design. The old crest was characterized by a detailed and intricate 3D effect, featuring a gradient ball encased within a crescent moon. This emblem also included the full text of the club&#x27;s name, &quot;Al Hilal,&quot; and the year of its founding, adding layers of historical context and a classic aesthetic to the crest.

The previous design&#x27;s rich detailing and the inclusion of the founding year offered a sense of tradition and heritage, but the new logo adopts a more streamlined and contemporary approach. The redesigned logo is limited to a blue and white color scheme, which helps in creating a cleaner and more distinctive visual identity.

Central to the new design are three vertical blue stripes that run parallel to each other. These stripes are interspersed with crescent moons, which are a nod to the club&#x27;s historical symbol. The most striking feature of the new logo is the use of negative space between the stripes. This clever design choice creates a white &#x27;H,&#x27; representing &#x27;Hilal,&#x27; the Arabic word for &#x27;crescent&#x27; and the name of the club. Additionally, the negative space also forms a subtle &#x27;S,&#x27; which stands for &#x27;Saudi,&#x27; linking the emblem to the country of the club&#x27;s origin.

&quot;The merging of the two letters in both languages in the logo is to symbolize the form of a grand and solid shield suitable for all sports, and bearing the values and principals of Al-Hilal&quot;, the Al-Hilal club said officially in August 2022.

This modernized logo not only simplifies the club&#x27;s branding but also enhances its visual impact, making it more recognizable and aligned with current design trends. The focus on minimalism and the strategic use of color and space ensure that the new logo is both striking and versatile, suitable for various applications from digital media to merchandise.

== Mascot ==
The club mascot is a shark. A blue whale known for eating up all the trophies.

==Grounds ==
Al Hilal currently plays their home games at King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh, stadium that was constructed in 1987 with a capacity of 67,000 supporters and occasionally home games are taking place in Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium, one of oldest football grounds in Saudi Arabia which was built in 1969. In 2017, Al Hilal signed an agreement with King Saud University in Riyadh to use the university&#x27;s stadium for 3 seasons, from 2017–18 until the end of the 2019–20. In February 2022 it was announced that both Al Hilal and Al Nassr would become the tenants of the &quot;Qiddiya&#x27;s planned cliff-top 40,000+ seat stadium, once complete, will eventually become the new venue for home games for both teams and the full range of sporting facilities being developed will be made available for both clubs&quot;.

They have met 179 times, Al Hilal has won 72 times, lost 61 times, and 45 games have ended in a draw. The biggest win is for Al Hilal when they defeated Al Nassr 5–1 in Saudi Professional League 2016–2017. The rivalry with Al Nassr is more intense between them than the rivalry with Al Ittihad. As an example, when Al Hilal reached the 2014 AFC Champions League Final, in 2nd leg Al Nassr fans awaited Western Sydney Wanderers arrival at the airport to spur them on against Al Hilal and tried to sabotage Al Hilal&#x27;s ticket plan.

Al Hilal has a rivalry with Al-Ittihad. From the start of national competition the clubs were seen as representatives of the two biggest cities in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh and Jeddah. While Al Hilal have won four Asian Club Championship in years 1991, 1999–2000, 2019 and 2021, Al-Ittihad has won AFC Champions League two times in a row, in 2004 and 2005.

Sponsorships have been instrumental to the club&#x27;s finances due to the numerous lucrative deals signed by the club, as the club&#x27;s huge popularity and appeal locally, regionally and continentally generates a huge number of supporters and admirers, especially on social media; the club has over 15m followers across all social media accounts.

<doc id="1063248" wikidata="Q17065698" url="?curid=1063248" title="Why the Long Face (album)">
<text>Why the Long Face is the seventh studio album by Scottish band Big Country, released in June 1995. It was produced by Chris Sheldon and members of the band.

The album received a reissue as a deluxe four-disc box-set by Cherry Red Records in 2018. In addition to a remaster of the original album on disc one, the three additional CDs contain demos, B-sides and single edits, as well as the band&#x27;s 1996 live album &quot;Eclectic&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Why the Long Face&quot; was recorded between August 1994 and January 1995. The new material was met with a lukewarm response from the head of the band&#x27;s label Compulsion, Chris Briggs, who felt the band needed to do more work on the material. Compulsion ended up dropping Big Country and the band subsequently signed to Transatlantic in March 1995, with &quot;Why the Long Face&quot; being released on the label in June 1995.

Speaking to &quot;The Lennox Herald&quot; in 1995, lead vocalist and guitarist Stuart Adamson said of the album, &quot;I think that this album flows well and that there is no filler on it. It&#x27;s strong enough for us to do most of it live on stage.&quot; He added to the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s not a departure from or a return to anything really. This time round though, I think the songs are more intimate and personal as opposed to being about big impersonal issues. They&#x27;ve got real characters, strong verses and choruses.&quot;

==Critical reception==

On its release, Neil McKay of &quot;Sunday Life&quot; felt &quot;Why the Long Face&quot; failed to meet the same standard as &quot;The Buffalo Skinners&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Solid and workmanlike, it lacks real inspiration. &#x27;Sail into Nothing&#x27;, &#x27;God&#x27;s Great Mistake&#x27;, &#x27;Wildland in My Heart&#x27; and &#x27;Blue on a Green Planet&#x27; all try hard, but diminishing returns seem to be setting in.&quot; Chris Heath of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the album as &quot;rather good&quot; and noted, &quot;It was with minimal interest that I put on their new album, and with astonishment that I heard tune after tune of the sort which, if they had released them in 1987, would have saved their career.&quot; Mark Beaumont of &quot;NME&quot; was highly negative of the album, calling it &quot;turgid bargain-bin fodder&quot;, with &quot;a cesspool full of anonymous squidge-rawkers&quot;, &quot;slabs of immense blandness&quot;, &quot;a huge dollop of Huey Lewis&quot; and lyrics &quot;that have all the subtlety of Vinnie Jones&quot;.

<text>The Ford CD2 platform (for &quot;C/D-class&quot; and called &quot;U204&quot; internally) is an automobile platform for crossover SUVs. It is the basis for the Mazda Tribute, Ford Escape, and Mercury Mariner, and was jointly developed by Mazda and Ford. The design is based on Mazda&#x27;s GF platform, used by the Mazda Capella/626.

CD2 is a front wheel drive platform with an all wheel drive option. Tributes and Escapes are manufactured at Mazda&#x27;s Hofu Plant and Ford&#x27;s Kansas City Assembly in Claycomo, Missouri. A Mercury Mariner version was briefly produced at the Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake, Ohio, but this line was halted in mid-2005 to allow the plant to convert to Ford Econoline production. The Mariner was subsequently produced at the Kansas City Assembly plant.

The CD2 vehicles were updated for the 2008 model year with a new exterior and interior, but the chassis and powertrain are mainly carried over. The 2008 models debuted in early 2007. A shortened 2007 production run caused Mazda to halt construction of the 2007 model year Tribute for North America. For the 2009 model year, the vehicles received new powertrain options designed to increase power and fuel economy over the previous models.

<text>State Treasurer of Mississippi is a post created in 1817 when the state was admitted to the Union. Before the state was formed by splitting the Alabama Territory from the Mississippi Territory, an equivalent post was the Territorial Treasurer General, established in 1802.

== History ==
The position of state treasurer was enumerated as part of the executive branch in Mississippi&#x27;s first constitution in 1817. The office was filled by the choice of the Mississippi Legislature. The first treasurer, Samuel Brooks, was elected on December 19, 1817. The 1832 constitution stipulated that the treasurer was to be popularly elected to serve a two-year term. The 1869 constitution expanded the officer&#x27;s term to four years.

== Powers, responsibilities, and structure ==
Under Article 5, Section 134, of the Mississippi Constitution, the state treasurer is elected every four years. Candidates for the office must meet the same constitutional qualifications as candidates for the position of secretary of state; they must be at least 25 years old and have lived in the state for at least five years. The office holder is not subject to term limits.
Most of the treasurer&#x27;s duties are determined by state statute.

The treasurer is responsible for keeping certain financial records for the state, including receipts, deposits, and disbursement of money from the state treasury. The constitution requires the treasurer to review and approve all contracts for the provision of &quot;stationery, printing, paper, and fuel&quot; for state agencies and the legislature. They also oversee public bond issues. The treasurer is &quot;ex officio&quot; the treasurer of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission and chair of the College Savings Plan of Mississippi Board. They are also &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of several other state boards, including the State Bond Commission, Public Employees Retirement Board, Mississippi Business Finance Corporation, Mississippi Development Bank, License Tag Commission, Tort Claims Board, Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association Board, Mississippi Guaranty Pool Board, Economic Development Strategic Planning Task Force, State Prison Emergency and management board, and the Historic Properties Trust Fund Advisory Committee.

The treasurer&#x27;s salary is $90,000 per year, but is set to increase to $120,000 annually in 2024.

<text>Brian David Connell (born 23 April 1956) is a former New Zealand politician who represented the New Zealand National Party in the New Zealand Parliament from 2002 to 2008.

==Biography==


Born in Foxton in the Manawatū region, Connell studied history and geography at Massey University. He also gained a diploma in teaching. He worked as a primary school teacher for a time, then as a secondary school teacher, before moving to Australia, where he became a manager at a banking company in Victoria. After holding a number of management and consultancy positions, he returned to New Zealand and took up farming.

The voters of the Rakaia electorate elected Connell to Parliament in the 2002 election, replacing the retiring former Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as the National Party candidate. Connell served on the Law and Order and Commerce select committees.

Following Connell&#x27;s re-election in the 2005 election, National Party leader Don Brash ranked him 27th in the National party caucus of 48 MPs giving him the portfolios of forestry, commerce, consumer affairs and statistics. Although this gave Connell a higher position (he was previously unranked), Connell objected to such a lowly ranking, saying &quot;I would have liked bigger portfolios and a higher ranking based on my ability, rather than the leader slapping me around because I&#x27;m outspoken&quot; and describing it as a &quot;big rat to swallow&quot;. Don Brash responded by removing his portfolios and rank in the caucus, saying Connell no longer had his confidence. On 4 November 2005, Connell threatened to become an independent MP.

On 13 September 2006 TV3 News and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Connell had confronted Brash during a National Party caucus meeting with allegations of an extramarital affair. Brash issued a statement later that same day, declaring plans to take leave in order to sort out marital difficulties with his wife.

The National Party caucus suspended Connell on 26 September 2006. A statement released by the National Party said that Connell had failed to show the restraint and discipline expected of a caucus member, and that it had no confidence in him.

Connell reportedly declared that he planned to grow his hair as a protest until the National Party changed its leader: he later denied this.

Having already announced his intention to retire at the 2008 election, Connell retired from Parliament on 31 August 2008 to take up a job in Brisbane.
