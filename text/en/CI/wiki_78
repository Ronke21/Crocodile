<text>The Silver Legion of America, commonly known as the Silver Shirts, was an American fascist and pro-Nazi organization which was founded by William Dudley Pelley and headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina.

==History==
Pelley was a former journalist, novelist and screenwriter turned spiritualist who began to promote antisemitic views by 1931, including the belief that Jews were possessed by demons. He formed the Silver Legion with the goal of bringing about a &quot;spiritual and political renewal&quot;, inspired by the success of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi movement in Germany.

A nationalist, fascist group, the paramilitary Silver Legion wore a uniform modeled after the Nazis&#x27; brown shirts (SA), consisting of a silver shirt with a blue tie, along with a campaign hat and blue corduroy trousers with leggings. The uniform shirts bore a scarlet letter &quot;L&quot; over the heart, which according to Pelley was &quot;standing for Love, Loyalty, and Liberation.&quot; The blocky slab serif &quot;L&quot;-emblem was in a typeface similar to the present-day Rockwell Extra Bold. The organizational flag was a plain silver field with a red &quot;L&quot; in the canton on the upper left hand corner. By 1934, the Legion claimed that it had 15,000 members.

Legion leader Pelley called for the establishment of a &quot;Christian Commonwealth&quot; in America, a government that would combine the principles of fascism, theocracy, and socialism, along with the exclusion of Jews and non-whites. He claimed he would save America from Jewish communists just as &quot;Mussolini and his Black Shirts saved Italy and as Hitler and his Brown Shirts saved Germany.&quot; Pelley ran in the 1936 presidential election on a third-party ticket under the Christian Party banner. Pelley hoped to seize power in a &quot;silver revolution&quot; and set himself up as the dictator of the United States. He would be called &quot;the Chief&quot;, a title which would be analogous to the titles used by other fascist leaders, such as &quot;Der Führer&quot; for Adolf Hitler and &quot;Il Duce&quot; for Benito Mussolini. However, the Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt was re-elected, and Pelley failed to appear in the top four. By around 1937, the Silver Legion&#x27;s membership had declined to about 5,000. In 1936, a small Silver Shirt office was established in downtown Spokane. About 200 members participated before the group&#x27;s end.

When the Silver Shirts tried to hold a rally at the Elks Club in Minneapolis, the meeting was interrupted by senior local Jewish-American organized crime figure David Berman.

Pelley disbanded the organization soon after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

On January 20, 1942, Pelley was sentenced to serve two to three years in prison by Superior Court Judge F. Don Phillips, in Asheville, North Carolina, for violating terms of probation of a 1935 conviction for violating North Carolina security laws. The same sentence had been suspended pending good behavior, but the court found that during that period, Pelley had published false and libelous statements, published inaccurate reports and advertising, and supported a secret military organization. For claiming that the devastation of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was worse than the government claimed, Pelley was arrested by federal authorities and sentenced to 15 years in prison for sedition and conspiracy to commit sedition, including for making seditious statements, obstructing military recruiting, and fomenting insurrection within the military.

==In popular culture==
* Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; depicts a fascist takeover of the United States by an anti-Roosevelt demagogue who claims that he is inspired to do so by the Silver Legion of America.
* In the Paradox Interactive video game &quot;Hearts of Iron IV&quot;, should the United States turn fascist, the Silver Legion of America will be depicted as the ruling party. Pelley can become president if certain conditions are met and the country will be renamed to the &quot;Free American Empire&quot;.

<text>Dudinka (; Nenets: Тут&#x27;ын, &quot;Tutꜧyn&quot;) is a town on the Yenisei River and the administrative center of Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. It used to be the administrative center of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug, which was merged into Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2007. Population: 

==History==
It was founded in 1667 as a winter settlement connected to Mangazeya. In 1930 it was designated the administrative center of the Taimyr Dolgan-Nenets National Region. In 1935, the polar explorer Otto Schmidt recommended that the settlement be expanded into a town. By 1937, the port facilities and a railroad to Norilsk were completed. Town status was granted in 1951.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Dudinka serves as the administrative center of Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated within Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District as the district town of Dudinka. As a municipal division, the district town of Dudinka is incorporated within Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky Municipal District as Dudinka Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
Dudinka processes and sends cargo via Norilsk railway to the Norilsk Mining and Smelting Factory and also ships non-ferrous metals, coal and ore. In 1969, the Messoyakha-Dudinka-Norilsk natural gas pipeline was laid.
Dudinka is home to a unique Arctic port, in the lower reaches of the Yenisey, which accessible to both sea and river ships. During the navigation season, from mid-June to October, the port can receive both seafaring ships and river vessels from Krasnoyarsk (about 2,000 km along the Yenisey). At this time, fresh food and essential goods are brought to Dudinka and then to Norilsk from the &quot;mainland&quot;. As soon as the navigation is possible, fruit and vegetable stalls spring up in the streets and food prices in grocery stores drop drastically. And, when the Yenisey is icebound, Dudinka receives and dispatches ice-class vessels taking the Northern Sea Route. They take away the products of the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine and bring the fuel and raw materials that industrial plants rely on for their operation. The port operates every day apart from a couple of weeks a year, when it is flooded during the spring high water. It is the only port in the world that experiences such a nuisance. When, at the end of May, the ice starts breaking up on the Yenisey, the cranes are moved from the port to special holding areas, where they remain for the duration of the high water. All large cargoes are delivered exclusively by water.
The town is served by the Dudinka Airport.

===Infrastructure===
Near Dudinka there is a tall radio mast which was formerly used for the CHAYKA radio navigation system. It is a grounded mast with a rhombic cage antenna.
==Geography==
===Climate===
Despite lying more than two degrees above the Arctic Circle, Dudinka has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) with short, mild summers and severely cold winters. Average high temperature even in May is below freezing and short summer starts in mid June and lasts only 2 months, despite the midnight sun. Precipitation is moderate; it falls mostly as rain in summer and mainly as snow throughout the rest of the year.

== Sports and entertainment ==
The Taymyr ice arena is the newly built ice hockey, figure skating and curling facility in Dudinka. It is the northernmost ice arena in the world that is fit for holding high-level, international events. The spectators capacity of the arena is 350 seats. The 2017 CCT Arctic Cup took place in the city of Dudinka at the Taymyr ice arena on May 18–22, 2017. It was the first-ever international curling tournament among women teams beyond the Arctic Circle. The event was held with participation of eight strongest teams from the northern countries, located at the 69th parallel. Participant teams included Russian National Team, Team Krasnoyarsk, Team Canada, Team USA, Team Finland. A wild card from the Organizing Committee was granted to Team Switzerland. Since 2017 Dudinka becomes the place where the international Arctic Curling Cup tournament takes place annually. The test event for this tournament was TAYMYR CURLING CUP 2016. The first-ever curling tournament among men teams beyond the Arctic Circle took place in Dudinka on May 26–30, 2016. The tournament was held as a test event for the Arctic Curling Cup. Six strongest Russian men teams took part in the event. In 2018 Dudinka held the final tour of the international Arctic Curling Cup. 10 strongest teams, three of which were Russian, were competing in double-mixed. Maria Komarova and Daniel Goryachov received bronze medals in this tournament.

<doc id="1070827" wikidata="Q461096" url="?curid=1070827" title="Ibn Hisham">
<text>Abu Muhammad Abd al-Malik ibn Hisham ibn Ayyub al-Himyari (; died 7 May 833), known simply as Ibn Hisham, was a 9th-century Abbasid historian and scholar. He grew up in Basra, in modern-day Iraq and later moved to Egypt.

== Life ==

Ibn Hisham has been said to have grown up in Basra and moved afterwards to Egypt. His family was native to Basra but he himself was born in Old Cairo. He gained a name as a grammarian and student of language and history in Egypt. His family was of Himyarite origin and belonged to Banu Ma‘afir tribe of Yemen.

==Biography of Muḥammad ==

&quot;As-Sīrah an-Nabawiyyah&quot; (), &#x27;The Life of the Prophet&#x27;; is an edited recension of Ibn Isḥāq&#x27;s classic &quot;Sīratu Rasūli l-Lāh&quot; () &#x27;The Life of God&#x27;s Messenger&#x27;. Ibn Isḥāq&#x27;s now lost work survives only in Ibn Hishām&#x27;s and al-Tabari&#x27;s recensions, although fragments of several others survive, and Ibn Hishām and al-Tabarī share virtually the same material.
Ibn Hishām explains in the preface of the work, the criteria by which he made his choice from the original work of Ibn Isḥāq in the tradition of his disciple Ziyād al-Baqqāʾi (d. 799). Accordingly, Ibn Hishām omits stories from &quot;Al-Sīrah&quot; that contain no mention of Muḥammad, certain poems, traditions whose accuracy Ziyād al-Baqqāʾi could not confirm, and offensive passages that could offend the reader. Al-Tabari includes controversial episodes of the Satanic Verses including an apocryphal story about Muḥammad&#x27;s attempted suicide. Ibn Hishām gives more accurate versions of the poems he includes and supplies explanations of difficult terms and phrases of the Arabic language, additions of genealogical content to certain proper names, and brief descriptions of the places mentioned in &quot;Al-Sīrah&quot;. Ibn Hishām appends his notes to the corresponding passages of the original text with the words: &quot;qāla Ibn Hishām&quot; (Ibn Hishām says).

===Translations and editions===
Later Ibn Hishām&#x27;s &quot;As-Sira&quot; would chiefly be transmitted by his pupil, Ibn al-Barqī. This treatment of Ibn Ishāq&#x27;s work was circulated to scholars in Cordoba in Islamic Spain by around 864. The first printed edition was published in Arabic by the German orientalist Ferdinand Wüstenfeld, in Göttingen (1858-1860). The &quot;Life of Moḥammad According to Moḥammed b. Ishāq&quot;, ed. &#x27;Abd al-Malik b. Hisham. Gustav Weil (Stuttgart 1864) was the first published translation.

In the 20th century the book has been printed several times in the Middle East. The German orientalist Gernot Rotter produced an abridged (about one third) German translation of &quot;The life of the Prophet. As-Sīra An-Nabawīya&quot;. (Spohr, Kandern in the Black Forest 1999). An English translation by the British orientalist Alfred Guillaume: The Life of Muhammad. A translation of Ishaq&#x27;s Sirat Rasul Allah. (1955); 11th edition. (Oxford University Press, Karachi 1996).

==Another Works==
Ibn Hisham also known as the author of the commentaries of &quot;The Book of Crowns on the Kings of Himyar&quot;. Ibn Hisham reported that he acquired the book narrative from &#x27;Abd al-mun&#x27;im idris. Ibn Hisham, who authored the commentaries of this book, also gave his own analysis that the Yemen region name were given from their primordial founder, Ya&#x27;rub (son of Qahtan), who also known by his other name, &quot;Yaman&quot;.

<text>The Sicilians (), or Sicilian people, are a Romance-speaking European ethnic group who are indigenous to the island of Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, as well as the largest and most populous of the autonomous regions of Italy.

==History==

The Sicilian people are indigenous to the island of Sicily, which was first populated beginning in the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. According to the famous Italian historian Carlo Denina, the origin of the first inhabitants of Sicily is no less obscure than that of the first Italians; however, there is no doubt that a large part of these early individuals traveled to Sicily from Southern Italy—others from the Islands of Greece, and the coasts of Iberia and Western Europe.

===Prehistory===

The aboriginal inhabitants of Sicily, long absorbed into the population, were tribes known to the ancient Greek writers as the Elymians, the Sicanians, and the Sicels, the last being an Indo-European-speaking people of possible Italic affiliation, who migrated from the Italian mainland (likely from the Amalfi Coast or Calabria via the Strait of Messina) during the second millennium BC, after whom the island was named. The Elymian tribes have been speculated to be a Indo-European people who migrated to Sicily from either Central Anatolia, Southern-Coastal Anatolia, Calabria, or one of the Aegean Islands, or perhaps were a collection of native migratory maritime-based tribes from all previously mentioned regions, and formed a common &quot;Elymian&quot; tribal identity/basis after settling down in Sicily. When the Elymians migrated to Sicily is unknown, however scholars of antiquity considered them to be the second oldest inhabitants, while the Sicanians, thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Sicily by scholars of antiquity, were speculated to also be a pre-Indo-European tribe, who migrated via boat from the Xúquer river basin in Castellón, Cuenca, Valencia and Alicante. Before the Sicanians lived in the easternmost part of the Iberian peninsula. The name &#x27;Sicanus&#x27; has been asserted to have a possible link to the modern river known in Valencian as the Xúquer and in Castilian as the Júcar. The Beaker was introduced in Sicily from Sardinia and spread mainly in the north-west and south-west of the island. In the northwest and in the Palermo kept almost intact its cultural and social characteristics, while in the south-west there was a strong integration with local cultures. The only known single bell-shaped glass in eastern Sicily was found in Syracuse.

All three tribes lived both a sedentary pastoral and orchard farming lifestyle, and a semi-nomadic fishing, transhumance and mixed farming lifestyle. Prior to the Neolithic Revolution, Paleolithic Sicilians would have lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, just like most human cultures before the Neolithic. The river Salsu was the territorial boundary between the Sicels and Sicanians. They wore basic clothing made of wool, plant fibre, papyrus, esparto grass, animal skins, palm leaves, leather and fur, and created everyday tools, as well as weapons, using metal forging, woodworking and pottery. They typically lived in a nuclear family unit, with some extended family members as well, usually within a drystone hut, a neolithic long house or a simple hut made of mud, stones, wood, palm leaves or grass. Their main methods of transportation were horseback, donkeys and chariots. Evidence of pet wildcats, cirneco dogs and children&#x27;s toys have been discovered in archaeological digs, especially in cemetery tombs. Their diet was a typical Mediterranean diet, including unique food varieties such as Gaglioppo, Acitana and Diamante citron, while in modern times the Calabrian Salami, which is also produced in Sicily, and sometimes used to make spicy &#x27;Nduja spreadable paste/sauce, is a popular type of salami sold in Brazil and the Anglosphere. All 3 tribes also specialised in building megalithic single-chambered dolmen tombs, a tradition which dates back to the Neolithic. &quot;An important archaeological site, located in Southeast Sicily, is the Necropolis of Pantalica, a collection of cemeteries with rock-cut chamber tombs. Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC., recent estimates suggest a figure of just under 4,000 tombs. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the Anapo river with its tributary, the Calcinara, about 23 km (14 mi) northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of Syracuse, Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. The site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archeologist, Paolo Orsi, although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. Items found within the tombs of Pantalica, some now on display at the Archaeology Museum in Syracuse, were the characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels, and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and clothing, such as bronze fibulae (brooches) and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age, although the size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been around 1000 people.&quot;

Nuragic ceramic remains, (from Sardinia), carbon dated to the 13th century BC, have been found in Lipari. The prehistoric Thapsos culture, associated with the Sicani, shows noticeable influences from Mycenaean Greece. The type of burial found in the necropolis of the Thapsos culture, is characterized by large rock-cut chamber tombs, and often of &quot;tholos-type&quot; that some scholars believe to be of Mycenaean derivation, while others believe it to be the traditional shape of the hut. The housing are made up of mostly circular huts bounded by stone walls, mainly in small numbers. Some huts have rectangular shape, particularly the roof. The economy was based on farming, herding, hunting and fishing. There are numerous evidences of trading networks, in particular of bronze vessels and weapons of Mycenaean and Nuragic (Sardinian) production. There were close trading relationships/networks established with the &quot;Milazzo Culture&quot; of the Aeolian Islands, and with the Apennine culture of mainland southern Italy. In Sicily&#x27;s earlier prehistory, there is also evidence of trade with the Capsian and Iberomaurusian mesolithic cultures from Tunisia, with some lithic stone sites attested in certain parts of the island.

Another archaeological site, originally identified by Paolo Orsi on the basis of a particular ceramic style, is the Castelluccio culture which dates back to the Ancient Bronze Age (2000 B.C. approximately), and is seen as sort of a &quot;prehistoric proto-civilization&quot;, located between Noto and Siracusa. The discovery of a prehistoric village in Castelluccio di Noto, next to the remains of prehistoric circular huts, led to finds of Ceramic glass decorated with brown lines on a yellow-reddish background, and tri-color with the use of white. The weapons used in the days of Castelluccio culture were green stone and basalt axes and, in the most recent settlements, bronze axes, and frequently carved bones, considered idols similar to those of Malta, and of Troy II and III. Burials were made in rounded tombs carved into the rock, with doors with relief carving of spiral symbols and motifs that evoke the sexual act. The Castelluccio culture is dated to a period between 2200 BC and 1800 BC, although some believe it to be contemporary to the Middle-Late Helladic period (1800/1400 BC).&quot; &quot;Sites related to the Castelluccio culture were present in the villages of south-east Sicily, including Monte Casale, Cava/Quarry d&#x27;Ispica, Pachino, Niscemi, Cava/Quarry Lazzaro, near Noto, of Rosolini, in the rocky Byzantine district of coastal Santa Febronia in Palagonia, in Cuddaru d&#x27; Crastu (Tornabé-Mercato d&#x27;Arrigo) near Pietraperzia, where there are remains of a fortress partly carved in stone, and – with different ceramic forms – also near Agrigento in Monte Grande. The discovery of a cup of &#x27;Etna type&#x27; in the area of Comiso, among local ceramic objects led to the discovery of commercial trades with the Castelluccio sites of Paternò, Adrano and Biancavilla, whose graves differ in making due to the hard basaltic terrain and also for the utilization of the lava caves as chamber tombs. In the area around Ragusa, there have been found evidences of mining among the ancient residents of Castelluccio; tunnels excavated by the use of basalt bats allowed the extraction and production of highly sought flints. Some dolmens, dated back to this same period, with sole funeral function, are found in different parts of Sicily and attributable to a people not belonging to the Castelluccio Culture.&quot;

The Sicelian polytheistic worship of the ancient and native chthonic, animistic-cult deities associated with geysers known as the Palici, as well as the worship of the volcano-fire god by the name of Adranos, were also worshiped throughout Sicily by the Elymians and Sicanians. Their (Palici) centre of worship was originally based on three small lakes that emitted sulphurous vapors in the Palagonian plains, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with geysers and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palici in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted. The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain. According to Macrobius, the nymph Thalia gave birth to the divine twins while living underneath the Earth. They were most likely either the sons of the native fire god Adranos, or, as Polish historian &quot;Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak&quot; suggests, the Palici may derive from the old Proto-Indo-European mytheme of the divine twins. Mount Etna is named after the mythological Sicilian nymph called Aetna, who might have been the possible mother to the Palici twins. Mount Etna was also believed to have been the region where Zeus buried the Serpentine giant Typhon, and the humanoid giant Enceladus in classical mythology. The Cyclopes, giant one-eyed humanoid creatures in classical Greco-Roman mythology, known as the maker of Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts, were traditionally associated with Sicily and the Aeolian Islands. The Cyclopes were said to have been assistants to the Greek blacksmith God Hephaestus, at his forge in Sicily, underneath Mount Etna, or perhaps on one of the nearby Aeolian Islands. The Aeolian Islands, off the coast of Northwestern Sicily, were themselves named after the mythological king and &quot;keeper of the heavy winds&quot; known as Aeolus. In his &quot;Hymn to Artemis&quot;, Cyrene poet Callimachus states that the Cyclopes on the Aeolian island of Lipari, working &quot;at the anvils of Hephaestus&quot;, make the bows and arrows used by Apollo and Artemis. The Hesiodic Latin poet Ovid names three Cyclopes &quot;Brontes, Steropes and Acmonides&quot; working as forgers inside Sicilian caves.

Besides Demeter (the Greek goddess of agriculture and law), and Persephone (the Greek personified goddess of vegetation), The Phoenician bull god Moloch (a significant deity also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible), the Phoenician moon goddess of fertility and prosperity Astarte (with her Roman equivalent being Venus), the Punic goddess Tanit, and the weather &amp; war god Baal (which later evolved into the Carthaginian god Baal Hammon), as well as the Carthaginian chief god Baal Hammon, also had centres of cultic-worship throughout Sicily. The river Anapus was viewed as the personification of the river god Anapus in Greek-Sicilian mythology. The Elymians inhabited the western parts of Sicily, while the Sicanians inhabited the central parts, and the Sicels inhabited the eastern parts.

===Ancient history===

From the 11th century BC, Phoenicians began to settle in western Sicily, having already started colonies on the nearby parts of North Africa and Malta. Sicily was later colonized and heavily settled by Greeks, beginning in the 8th century BC. Initially, this was restricted to the eastern and southern parts of the island. As the Greek and Phoenician communities grew more populous and more powerful, the Sicels and Sicanians were pushed further into the centre of the island. The independent Phoenician colonial settlements were eventually absorbed by Carthage during the 6th century BC. By the 3rd century BC, Syracuse was the most populous Greek city state in the world. Sicilian politics was intertwined with politics in Greece itself, leading Athens, for example, to mount the disastrous Sicilian Expedition against Syracuse in 415–413 BC during the Peloponnesian War, which ended up severely affecting a defeated Athens, both politically and economically, in the following years to come. Another battle which Syracuse took part in, this time under the Tyrant Hiero I of Syracuse, was the Battle of Cumae, where the combined navies of Syracuse and Cumae defeated an Etruscan force, resulting in significant territorial loses for the Etruscans. The constant warfare between Ancient Carthage and the Greek city-states eventually opened the door to an emerging third power. In the 3rd century BC, the Messanan Crisis, caused by Mamertine mercenaries from Campania, when the city-states of Messina (Carthaginian-owned) and Syracuse (Dorian-owned) were being constantly raided and pillaged by Mamertines, during the period (282–240 BC) when Central, Western and Northeast Sicily were put under Carthaginian rule, motivated the intervention of the Roman Republic into Sicilian affairs, and led to the First Punic War between Rome and Carthage. By the end of the war in 242 BC, and with the death of Hiero II, all of Sicily except Syracuse was in Roman hands, becoming Rome&#x27;s first province outside of the Italian peninsula. For the next 600 years, Sicily would be a province of the Roman Republic and later Empire. Prior to Roman rule, there were three native Elymian towns by the names of Segesta, Eryx and Entella, as well as several Siculian towns called Agyrion, Kale Akte (founded by the Sicel leader Ducetius), Enna and Pantalica, and one Sicanian town known as Thapsos. (Greek: Θάψος)

Sometime after Carthage conquered most of Sicily except for the Southeast which was still controlled by Syracuse, Pyrrhus of Epirus, the Molossian king of Epirus, was installed as King/Tyrant of Sicily from 278 to 275 BC, even capturing the native Elymian mountain-city of Eryx, which was previously under Carthaginian fortification &amp; protection before he captured it. Pyrrhus even attempted to capture Lilybaeum (Siege of Lilybaeum) from the Punics, which didn&#x27;t succeed. A couple years later (275 BC), Envoys from Southern Italy had notified him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum hadn&#x27;t fallen to the Romans. Upon hearing this, coinciding with the fact that the Sicilian city-states had started becoming hostile towards him, due to him trying to force Sicily into becoming a martial state, Pyrrhus made his decision to depart from the island and dethrone himself, leaving Syracuse and Carthage in charge of the island again. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the Punic Wars, said to his companions: &quot;What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.&quot; While his army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, Pyrrhus&#x27; navy was destroyed by the Carthaginians at the Battle of the Strait of Messina, with 98 warships sunk or disabled out of 110. After Pyrrhus of Epirus landed on Mainland Italy, his Roman opponents had mastered up a large army under Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus, while he was still Tyrant of Sicily. After Pyrrhus was defeated at the Battle of Beneventum (275 BC) by the Romans, he decided to end his campaigns against Southern Italy, and return to Epirus, resulting in the loss of all his territorial gains in Italy. The city of Tarentum however still remained under Epirote control.

The ancient historian Diodorus Siculus who wrote and recorded the monumental universal history Bibliotheca historica, and the ancient Doric-Greek revolutionary scientist, inventor and mathematician Archimedes who anticipated modern calculus, and analysis by applying methods of infinitesimals and exhaustion to rigorously derive and prove the range of geometric theorems, and invented the innovative Archimedean screw, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native town of Syracuse from invasions, were both born, grew up in, lived and died in Sicily.

===Middle Ages===

As the Roman Empire was falling apart, a Germanic tribe known as the Vandals along with a Scythian tribe originating from the European Steppe known as the Alans took over Sicily for a relatively brief period beginning in 440 AD under the rule of their king Geiseric, forming the Kingdom of the Vandals. The Vandals and Alans gained a monopoly on the Mediterranean grain trade during their monarchical reign, with all grain taxes being monitored by them. Due to the Western Roman Empire being too preoccupied with war in Gaul, when the Vandals &amp; Alans started invading Sicily in 440, the Romans could not respond. Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II sent a failed expeditionary force to deal with them in 441, which ended in a Vandal-Alan counter-victory. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions, except for one toehold in Lilybaeum, to Odoacer (an Arian Christian Barbarian statesman &amp; general of possible East Germanic &amp; Hunnic descent, and client king under Zeno whose reign over Italy marked the Fall of the Western Roman Empire) in 476 and completely to the Ostrogothic conquest of Sicily by Theodoric the Great which began in 488; although the Goths were Germanic, Theodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In contrast to the prior Carthaginian, Syracusan (Dorian) and Roman Empires which ruled Sicily in the past, Sicily did not serve as a distinct province or administrative region under Germanic control, although it did retain a certain amount of autonomy. The Gothic War took place between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantine Empire (with its capital-city based at Constantinople, modern Istanbul), and during the reign of Justinian I, Sicily was brought back under Greco-Roman rule under the military expeditions of Byzantine generals Flavius Belisarius and Narses, resulting in Byzantine-Greek language and religion being embraced by the majority of the population. It was Syracuse where the Byzantine Emperor Constans II desired to move his capital in 663 AD, a decision which eventually led to his assassination. Sicily remained under autonomous stable Byzantine rule as the Theme/Province of Sicily (Theme (Byzantine district)) for several peaceful centuries, until an invasion by Arab Muslims (Aghlabids from the Banu Tamim Clan) in the 9th century.

Besides Sicily, the Theme or province of Sicily also included the adjacent region of Calabria in Mainland Italy. The capital city of Byzantine Sicily was Syracuse. The province was looked after by the imperial governor known as a Praetor, and was militarily protected under a general by the title of Dux. Sicily itself was divided into many districts known as a Turma. The Byzantine Exarch of Ravennan Italy named Theophylact, between 702 and 709, originally came from Sicily. After he got promoted into the Exarchate, Theophylact marched from Sicily to Rome for unknown reasons, a decision which angered the local Roman soldiers living there, however the newly elected Pope John VI, was able to calm them down. While Theophylact was still Exarch, Byzantine Emperor Justinian II seized all the leading citizens and officials of Ravenna at a local banquet, and dragged them abroad a ship to Constantinople. He sentenced all but one of the Ravennan captives to death, the exception being Archbishop Felix, who was permanently blinded instead. This was due to a recent rebellion which Ravenna took part in, in 695. Justinian II later sacked Ravenna, weakening the Exarchate in charge of it. Theophylact was not a victim of the catastrophe, but was the first Exarch to experience a weakened Ravenna. Theophylact possibly moved back to Sicily after he retired from the Exarchate in 709. Theophylact might have also been the Strategos of Sicily from 700 to 710. The Strategos of Sicily was also able to exercise some control over the autonomous duchies of Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi, depending on the local political situation or faction at the time.

The Aghlabid invasions were in part caused by the Byzantine-Sicilian military commander Euphemius, who invited the Aghlabids to aid him in his rebellion against the imperial governor of Sicily in 826 AD. A similar situation happened a century prior, when the imperial governor of Sicily (Sergios), had declared a Byzantine official from Constantinople by the name of Basil Onomagoulos (regnal name Tiberius) as rival emperor, when false news reached Sicily that Constantinople had fallen to the Umayyads. When Emperor Leo the Syrian sent an administrative official named Paul to Sicily, the people and army of Syracuse surrendered Basil and his rebels up to him, leading to the beheading of Basil, while the former governor Sergios was able to escape to the parts of Mainland Italy controlled by the Lombards. Another rebellion took place between the years 781–793, when the aristocratic governor of Sicily, Elpidius, was accused of conspiring against Empress Irene in favour of Nikephoros. After Elpidius&#x27;s forces were militarily defeated by Empress Irene&#x27;s large fleet dispatched in Sicily, he, along with his lieutenant, the dux of Calabria named Nikephoros, defected to the Abbasid Caliphate, where he was posthumously acknowledged as rival emperor. After losing another military expedition, this time against Asia Minor with the help of the Abbasids, he advised the Abbasid Emir of Mesopotamia, Abd al-Malik ibn Salih, to &quot;throw away his silk and put on his armour&quot;, warning him against the aggressive new reign of Nikephoros I. The Muslim conquest was a see-saw affair; the local population resisted fiercely and the Arabs suffered considerable dissension and infighting among themselves during this process. Not until 965 was the island&#x27;s conquest successfully completed by the Fatimid Caliphate, with Syracuse in particular resisting almost to the end (Siege of Syracuse (877-878)). Jawhar the Sicilian, the Fatimid general of Slavic origins that led the conquest of Egypt, under Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah, was born and grew up in Ragusa, Sicily. Jawhar served as viceroy of Egypt until 973, consolidating Fatimid control over North Africa, and laying the foundations for Cairo.

The first phase of Muslim rule began with the conquests of the third Aghlabid Emir Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya, and consolidated with the reign of the ninth Emir Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya after the conquest of Taormina. The first attempt to capture Syracuse was under general Asad ibn al-Furat, although it ended in a Byzantine victory. A combination of Persian and Andalusian troops helped to capture the Island between 830 and 831. After a revolt was suppressed, the Fatimid Caliph Al-Mansur Billah appointed a member of the Kalbid dynasty, Al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi, as First Emir of Sicily. The Kalbids ruled Sicily from 948 to 1053. Al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis, fourth ruler of the Zirid Sanhaja dynasty in North Africa, attempted to annex the island for the Zirids, but his attempts failed. The new Arab rulers initiated land reforms, which in turn increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, a dent to the dominance of the landed estates. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems through Qanats, introducing oranges, lemons, pistachio, and sugarcane to Sicily. Ibn Hawqal, a Baghdadi merchant who visited Sicily in 950, commented that a walled suburb called the Kasr (the palace) was the center of Palermo, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman Catholic cathedral. The suburb of Al-Khalisa (Kalsa) contained the Sultan&#x27;s palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqual reckoned there were 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, behind Moorish-Spain&#x27;s capital Córdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450–500,000. Palermo&#x27;s population dropped to 150,000 under Norman rule. By 1330 Palermo&#x27;s population had declined to 51,000, possibly due to the inhabitants of the region being deported to other regions of Norman Sicily, or to the Norman County of Apulia and Calabria. The local population conquered by the Muslims were Greek-speaking Byzantine Christians, but there were also a significant number of Jews. Christians and Jews were tolerated in Muslim Sicily as dhimmis, and had to pay the Jizya poll tax, and Kharaj land tax, but were exempt from the Zakat alms-giving tax Muslims had to pay. Many Jews immigrated to Sicily during Muslim rule, but left after the Normans arrived.

In the 11th century, the mainland southern Italian powers were hiring Norman mercenaries, who were Christian descendants of the Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger I (of the Hauteville dynasty) who conquered Sicily from the Muslims over a period of thirty years until finally controlling the entire island by 1091 as the County of Sicily. In 1130, Roger II founded the Norman Kingdom of Sicily as an independent state with its own Parliament, language, schooling, army and currency, while the Sicilian culture evolved distinct traditions, clothing, linguistic changes, cuisine and customs not found in mainland Italy. A great number of families from northern Italy began settling in Sicily during this time, with some of their descendants forming distinct communities that survive to the present day, such as the Lombards of Sicily. Other migrants arrived from southern Italy, as well as Normandy, southern France, England and other parts of northern Europe.

The Siculo-Norman rule of the Hauteville dynasty continued until 1198, when Frederick II of Sicily, the son of a Siculo-Norman queen and a Swabian-German emperor ascended the throne. In fact, it was during the reign of this Hohenstaufen king Frederick II, that the poetic form known as a sonnet was invented by Giacomo da Lentini, the head Poet, Teacher and Notary of the Sicilian School for Poetry. Frederick II was also responsible for the Muslim settlement of Lucera. His descendants governed Sicily until the Papacy invited a French prince to take the throne, which led to a decade-and-a-half of French rule under Charles I of Sicily; he was later deposed in the War of the Sicilian Vespers against French rule, which put the daughter of Manfred of Sicily – Constance II and her husband Peter III of Aragon, a member of the House of Barcelona, on the throne. Their descendants ruled the Kingdom of Sicily until 1401. Following the Compromise of Caspe in 1412 the Sicilian throne passed to the Iberian monarchs from Aragon and Castile.

===Modern and contemporary history===
In 1735, the Spanish era ended when Charles V from the House of Bourbon was crowned king. For the better part of the next century-and-a-half, Sicily was in personal union with the other Southern Italian Kingdom of Naples, with the official residence located in Naples, under the Bourbon dynasty. After the Napoleonic Wars, King Ferdinand I, who had just recently been restored back to the throneship of Southern Italy in 1815, made a decision to administratively and politically merged the two separate Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which ended up forming the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1816. In 1861, however, Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Italy as a result of the Risorgimento. Prior to the Risorgimento, the Two Sicilies were conquered by the Kingdom of Sardinia during the Expedition of the Thousand (led by general Giuseppe Garibaldi) in 1860, and subsequently brought under the monarchial realm of Sardinia. After the unification of Italy and the Fascist era, a wave of Sicilian nationalism led to the adoption of the Statute of Sicily, under which the island has become an autonomous region. Since 1946, the island enjoys the most advanced special status of all the autonomous regions.

==Demographics==

Sicily has experienced the presence of a number of different cultures and ethnicities in its vast history, including the aboriginal peoples of differing ethnolinguistic origins (Sicani, Siculi and Elymians), Bruttians, Morgetes, Oenotrians, Phoenicians and Carthaginians, Ancient Greeks (Magna Graecia), Mamertines, Romans and Jews during the ancient and classical periods.

In the early medieval era, Sicily experienced the brief rule of Germanic Vandals and Iranic Alans during the Kingdom of the Vandals and Alans, while under Byzantine, Saracen and Norman rule, there were Byzantine Greeks, Arabs and Normans. From the late medieval period into the modern era, Aragonese, Spaniards and French ruled over and left a minor impact on the island, while Albanians settled and formed communities which still exist today known as the Arbereshe.

About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. However, in the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of millions of people moving to the Italian mainland and countries like Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. Many Sicilian communities, including those formed by the descendants of the Sicilian migrants, are all over the world. It is estimated that the number of people of Sicilian descent in the world is more than six million. The most famous community is represented by the Sicilian Americans.
Like the other parts of Southern Italy, immigration to the island is relatively low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, in search of better employment and industrial opportunities. The most recent ISTAT figures show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1 million population (nearly 3.5% of the population); Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe. As in the rest of Italy, the primary religion is Roman Catholicism (but with combined Latin &amp; Byzantine Rites) and the official language is Italian; Sicilian is currently not a recognised language in Italy.

=== Major settlements ===
In Sicily, there are three &quot;metropolitan areas&quot;:
# Palermo, which has a Larger Urban Zone of 1,044,169 people
# Catania, whose LUZ&#x27;s populous numbers some 801,280 people
# Messina and its LUZ, with a total of 418,916 people.

Overall, there are fifteen cities and towns with a population above 50,000 people, these are:
# Palermo (677,854)
# Catania (315,576)
# Messina (242,121)

# Vittoria (63,393)
# Caltanissetta (60,221)
# Agrigento (59,190)
# Bagheria (56,421)
# Modica (55,294)
# Acireale (53,205)
# Mazara del Vallo (51,413).

===Names and surnames===
The most common Sicilian names are &quot;Giuseppe&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Salvatore&quot;. The most common Sicilian surnames are &quot;Russo&quot;, &quot;Messina&quot; and &quot;Lombardo&quot;.
== Diaspora ==
In 2008, the number of Sicilians abroad was well over 1 million. The countries in which they are most numerous on this date are: United States, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, France and Canada. The population of the Diaspora without including those in the United States is 629,114 individuals.

In the United States, the Sicilian-Americans are a large subset of Americans whose ancestors came from Sicily. This group is perhaps the largest part of the Sicilian diaspora.

The entire autochthonous population of Malta is of Sicilian origin, but the Maltese generally do not consider themselves Sicilian due to centuries of cultural and geographical separation, and the fact that their native language evolved from Siculo-Arabic instead of Italo-Dalmatian like the modern Sicilian language.

==Genetics==
===Autosomal studies===
 Several studies involving whole genome analysis of mainland Italians and Sicilians have found that samples from Northern Italy, Southern Italy and Sicily belong to their own unique/distinct separate clusters, while a genetic gap is filled by an intermediate Central Italian cluster, creating a continuous cline of variation that mirrors geography. Genetically, Sicilians cluster the closest to other South Italians, and especially to Calabrians. Other studies have also demonstrated that the population of Sicily is genetically very similar to that of Malta, and to Greek speaking groups from the Ionian Islands, the Aegean Islands, Crete and the Peloponnese while the rest of mainland Greece appears as slightly differentiated, by clustering with the other Southern Balkan populations such as Albanians of Albania, Kosovo and the Arbëreshë people.

===MtDna and Y DNA studies===
According to one study, Y-DNA haplogroups were found at the following frequencies in Sicily:
R1 (36.76%), J (29.65%), E1b1b (18.21%), I (7.62%), G (5.93%), T (5.51%), Q (2.54%). R1 and I haplogroups are typical in West European and North European populations while J, T, G, Q and E1b1b (and their various subclades) consist of lineages with differential distribution across Europe and the Mediterranean. The five main MtDNA haplogroups present in Sicily are haplogroups H, K, X, W and U, which are also the five most commonly found MtDNA-haplogroups in Europe and the Caucasus.

The Norman Kingdom of Sicily was created in 1130, with Palermo as its capital, 70 years after the initial Norman invasion and 40 after the conquest of the last town, Noto in 1091, and would last until 1198. Today, it is in north-west Sicily, around Trapani, Palermo and Agrigento where Norman Y-DNA is the most common, with 8% to 20% of the lineages belonging to haplogroup I1. Ancient and medieval Greek genetic paternal legacy is estimated at 37% in Sicily. Sicilians are of European genetic origin, with modern genetic profiles that are closely similar to people who lived in the region of Magna Graecia during the Classical antiquity period, these people were a mix of Italic Roman and Greek genetic ancestry. Sicilians closely resemble mainland Italians and Greeks genetically.

It is a misconception that Sicilians are of primarily Moorish or otherwise African origin, but this has been entirely disproven by genetic analysis of Sicilian genomes. The falsified myth that Sicilian DNA was of Moorish origin was fabricated by Anti-Italian xenophobic nativists from primarily anglophonic nations. Overall the estimated Central European and Northwestern European paternal contributions in South Italy and Sicily are about 63% and 26% respectively.

===Paleogenetics===
Fernandes et al. (2019), The Arrival of Steppe and Iranian Related Ancestry in the Islands of the Western Mediterranean, found that in Sicily, Western Steppe Herders ancestry arrived by ~2200 BCE and likely came at least in part from Spain. 4 of the 5 Early Bronze Age Sicilian males had Steppe-associated Y-haplogroup R1b1a1a2a1a2 (R-P312). Two of these were Y-haplogroup R1b1a1a2a1a2a1 (Z195) which today is largely restricted to Iberia and has been hypothesized to have originated there 2500–2000 BCE.

===Languages===

Today in Sicily most people are bilingual and speak both Italian and Sicilian, a distinct Romance language. Many Sicilian words are of Greek origin, while smaller numbers of other loan words are from Norman, Arabic, Catalan, Occitan, Spanish and other languages. Other dialects of Sicilian, or those very closely related to it, are also spoken in southern Calabria, Salento and Salerno.

Sicilian was an early influence in the development of standard Italian, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of Frederick II and his court of notaries or &quot;Magna Curia&quot; which, headed by Giacomo da Lentini, also gave birth to the Sicilian School, widely inspired by troubadour literature. It is in this language that appeared the first sonnet, whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself. Sicilian was also the official language of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1300 to 1543.

Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Sicilian people spoke only Sicilian as their mother tongue, with little or no fluent knowledge of Italian. Today, although not officially recognized by the Italian Republic, the Sicilian language is described as &quot;a stable indigenous language of Italy&quot; by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; and is recognized as a minority language by UNESCO. It has also been identified as a language by the Sicilian Region. Even so, Italian continues to be the sole official language recognized by the Italian Republic and predominates in the public arena, being used as everyday language in the daily lives of many Sicilians.

The Siculo-Arabic dialect was a vernacular variety of Arabic once spoken in Sicily and neighbouring Malta between the end of the ninth century and the mid to late thirteenth century. The language became extinct in Sicily, but in Malta it eventually evolved into what is now the Maltese language.

The Siculish dialect is the macaronic &quot;Sicilianization&quot; of English language words and phrases by immigrants from Sicily to the United States in the early 20th century. Forms of Siculish are also to be found in other Sicilian immigrant communities of English-speaking countries, namely Canada and Australia. A surprising similarity can often be found between these forms, through either coincidence, trans-national movements of Sicilian immigrants, or more likely, through the logical adaptation of English using linguistic norms from the Sicilian language.

====Ethno-linguistic minorities====
There are two main historical ethno-linguistic minorities in Sicily, the Lombards of Sicily and the Arbëreshë:
* The Lombards of Sicily are a linguistic minority living in Sicily who speak Gallo-Italic of Sicily, an isolated group of Gallo-Italic languages found in about 15 isolated communities of central eastern Sicily. Forming a language island within the Sicilian language, it dates back to migrations from Northern Italy to central and eastern Sicily about 900 years ago, during the Norman conquest of Sicily. Because of linguistic differences among the Gallo-Italic dialects of Sicily, it is supposed that there were different immigration routes. From Piedmont, Liguria, Emilia, and Lombardy they began to spread south between the 11th and 14th centuries. The most important areas where the Gallo-Italic of Sicily is spoken are Acquedolci, Montalbano Elicona, Novara di Sicilia, Fondachelli-Fantina San Fratello and San Piero Patti (Province of Messina), Aidone, Nicosia, Piazza Armerina and Sperlinga (Province of Enna).

* The Arbëreshë people settled in Southern Italy in the 15th to 18th centuries in several waves of migrations. They are the descendants of mostly Tosk Albanian refugees of Christian faith who fled to Italy after the conquest and subsequent Islamisation of Albania by the Ottoman Turks in the Balkans. They speak their own variant of the Arbëresh language. There are three identified Arbëreshë communities in the province of Palermo. The areas are: Contessa Entellina, Piana degli Albanesi and Santa Cristina Gela; while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely intelligible. The largest centre is Piana degli Albanesi which, besides being the hub of religious and socio-cultural communities, has kept their unique features intact over time. There are two other communities with a strong historical and linguistic heritage.
* The community of the Greeks of Messina (or Siculo-Greeks) speaks modern Greek with some elements of the ancient Greek language spoken in the island, and Calabrian Greek. The Greek community was reconstituted in 2003 with the name of &quot;Comunità Hellenica dello Stretto&quot; (Hellenic Community of the Strait).

===Religion===

Historically, Sicily has been home to many religions, including Islam, Native religions, Judaism, Classical Paganism, Carthaginian religions, and Byzantine Orthodoxy, the coexistence of which has been historically seen as an ideal example of religious multiculturalism. Most Sicilians today are baptized as Catholic. Catholicism and Latinization in Sicily originated from the islands Norman occupiers and forced conversion continued under the Spanish invaders, where the majority of Sicily&#x27;s population were forced to convert from their former religions. Despite the historical push for Catholicism in Sicily, a minority of other religious communities thrive in Sicily.

Sicilian Catholics

For Catholics in Sicily, the Virgin Hodegetria is the patroness of Sicily. The Sicilian people are also known for their deep devotion to some Sicilian female saints: the martyrs Agatha and Lucy, who are the patron saints of Catania and Syracuse respectively, and the hermit Saint Rosalia, patroness of Palermo. Sicilian people have significantly contributed to the history of many religions. There have been four Sicilian Popes (Agatho, Leo II, Sergius I, and Stephen III) and a Sicilian Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople (Methodios I). Sicily is also mentioned in the New Testament in the Acts of the Apostles, 28:11–13, in which Saint Paul briefly visits Sicily for three days before leaving the Island. It is believed he was the first Christian to ever set foot in Sicily.

Sicilian Muslims

During the period of Muslim rule, many Sicilians converted to Islam. Many Islamic scholars were born on the island, including Al-Maziri, a prominent jurist of the Maliki school of Sunni Islamic Law. Under the rule of Frederick II, all Muslims were expelled from the Island following a rebellion of local Saracens who wished to keep their local independence in Western Sicily but were not allowed to due to Pope Gregory IX&#x27;s demands. Any remaining Muslim was eventually expelled by the Spanish inquisition.

In more recent years, many immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries like Pakistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia have arrived on Sicily. In 1980, Catania, a city on the eastern coast of Sicily, became home to Italy&#x27;s first modern mosque. Also known as the Omar Mosque, it was financed by Libya.

Sicilian Jewish community

There is a legend that the Jews were first brought to Sicily as captive slaves in the 1st century after the Fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE by the Romans. However, it is generally presumed that Sicily&#x27;s Jewish population was ceded before the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem. Rabbi Akiva visited the city of Syracuse during one of his trips abroad. Judaism in Sicily was the first monotheistic religion to appear on the Island. The Jewish Sicilian community remained until the Aragonese rulers&#x27; Queen Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, expelled them in the year 1493 with the Alhambra Decree. On 3 February 1740, the Neapolitan King Charles III – hailed as an Enlightenment King, issued a proclamation containing 37 paragraphs, in which Jews for the first time were formally invited to return to Sicily. However, the effort was generally unsuccessful.

The Sicilian Jewish community still has several active members and has made a limited recovery in recent years. In the year 2005, for the first time since the Expulsion, a Passover Seder was conducted in Sicily (in Palermo), held by a Milanese Rabbi. The Jewish community in Sicily is led in part by Rabbi Stefano Di Mauro, a Sicilian American descendant of Sicilian &quot;neofiti&quot;. He opened a small synagogue in 2008, but he has not yet set up a full-time Jewish congregation in Sicily. Services are held weekly on Shabbat and the High Holy Days. Also, Shavei Israel has expressed interest in helping to facilitate the return of the Sicilian Bnei Anusim to Judaism.

<doc id="1070832" wikidata="Q1626270" url="?curid=1070832" title="English auction">
<text>An English auction is an open-outcry ascending dynamic auction. It proceeds as follows.
* The auctioneer opens the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid, a starting price, or a reserve for the item on sale.
* Then the auctioneer accepts increasingly higher bids from the floor and sometimes from other sources, for example online or telephone bids. The auctioneer usually determines the minimum increment of bids, often making them larger as bidding reaches higher levels.
* The highest bidder at any given moment is considered to have the standing bid, which can only be displaced by a higher bid from a competing buyer. 
* If no competing bidder challenges the standing bid within the time allowed by the auctioneer, the standing bid becomes the winner, and the item is sold to the highest bidder at a price equal to their bid.
*If no bidder accepts the starting price, the auctioneer either begins to lower the starting price in increments, or bidders are allowed to bid prices lower than the starting price, or the item is not sold at all, according to the wishes of the seller or protocols of the auction house.

The English auction is different from other auction systems in its most essential feature: the public bidding process can transmit information to bidders in real-time because it can potentially realize the sharing of private information. By introducing the common value factor, the English auction has a revenue advantage: each bidder&#x27;s private information about the common value is valuable information to the other bidders, and this information is disclosed during the public bidding process.

Unlike sealed-bid auctions (such as first-price sealed-bid auction or Vickrey auction), an English auction is &quot;open&quot; or fully transparent, as the identity (or at least the existence) of all bidders and their bids is disclosed to each other during the auction. 
More generally, an auction mechanism is considered &quot;English&quot; if it involves an iterative process of adjusting the price in a direction that is unfavorable to the bidders (increasing in price if the item is being sold to competing buyers or decreasing in price in a reverse auction with competing sellers). In contrast, a Dutch auction would adjust the price in a direction that favored the bidders (lowering the price if the item is being sold to competing buyers, increasing it, if it is a reverse auction).

When the auction involves a single item for sale and each participant has as an independent private value for the item auctioned, the expected payment and expected revenues of an English auction is theoretically equivalent to that of the Vickrey auction, and both mechanisms have weakly dominant strategies. Both the Vickrey and English auction, although very different procedurally, award the item to the bidder with the highest value at a price equal to the value of the second highest bidder.

==Variations==

There are many variations on this auction system. Sometimes, the reserve price is not revealed. Also, bids may be made with instead of being called out. Such signals can include tugging an ear or raising a bidding paddle. Another variation on the English auction is the open-exit auction, where the bidders must announce that they are dropping out of the bidding and they cannot re-enter.
In France, when the last bid has been made in an auction for an art object, a representative of the state can say &quot;Préemption de l&#x27;état&quot; (&quot;Pre-emption of the state&quot;) and buy the object for the highest bid. Some housing cooperatives similarly allow members of the cooperative to pre-empt any buyer of a house constructed by the cooperative. 

===Scottish auction===
In a Scottish auction (or also time-interval auction), all bidding should be completed within a certain time interval. This ruling provides the bidders an appropriate amount of time for consideration. Speed is not important in this type of auction.

===Candle auction===
A candle auction is a variation in which the end of the auction is signaled by the expiration of a candle flame. This was intended to ensure that no one could know exactly when the auction would end and make a last-second bid.

===Japanese auction===
A Japanese auction is a variant in which the current price changes continuously according to the auctioneer&#x27;s clock, rather than by bidders&#x27; outcries. Bidders can only decide if and when to exit the arena. At first glance, this seems equivalent to English auction: apparently, in an English auction, it is a dominant strategy for each buyer whose price is above the displayed price, to always bid the minimal allowed increment (e.g. one cent) above the displayed price, so the price should increase continuously. However, in real-life English auctions, jump bidding is often observed: buyers increase the displayed price much more than the minimal allowed increment. Obviously, jump-bidding is not possible in a Japanese auction. This may be seen as either an advantage or a disadvantage of the English auction format.

===Selling more than one item===
The English auction has variants for selling 
multiple identical items or multiple different items.

===Vickrey auction===
Vickrey auction is also known as Second-price sealed-bid auction. None of the bidders know what the other is offering. The bidder with the highest price wins, but only pays the value of the next highest bid. The most important feature of these auctions is that each bidder&#x27;s winning strategy is to bid according to their true valuation of the item; this auction mechanism is thus incentive-compatible. It is also a Pareto efficient allocation mechanism.

<text>The Don and Mike Show was an American nationally syndicated radio talk show hosted by the shock jocks Don Geronimo and Mike O&#x27;Meara, which aired from December 1985 through April 11, 2008. The show debuted on WAVA-FM in 1985 as &quot;The Morning Zoo with Don and Mike&quot;. The official name of the show became&quot; The Don and Mike Show&quot; when the duo moved to WJFK-FM in 1991. In the later years, the show was carried on 20–30 stations across the United States by the CBS-owned Westwood One Radio Network. The show&#x27;s flagship station was 106.7 WJFK-FM in Washington, D.C. In 2007 the show ranked #66 in the Talkers Magazine Heavy 100. Geronimo retired in 2008. The show&#x27;s last live regular episode with Geronimo was broadcast March 13, 2008 and Geronimo hosted a farewell show April 11, 2008. After Geronimo&#x27;s retirement, the remaining cast members formed the &quot;Mike O&#x27;Meara Show.&quot;

==Personalities==
The show was co-hosted by O&#x27;Meara and Geronimo. News briefs and occasional commentary were provided by Buzz Burbank. The show was most recently produced by former show intern Robb Spewak. Phone calls were screened by Joe Ardinger .

The show included four news reporters over the course of its run. David Haines (1985–1989), the program&#x27;s original newsman, died on July 10, 2005 Laurie Neff was the second newsperson.

Geronimo announced on February 4, 2008, that he would leave the show on May 30. That date was moved up to April 11, 2008, in a surprise announcement from the WJFK program director which also included the return of Beth Ann McBride as producer. The show was then known as &quot;The Mike O&#x27;Meara Show&quot;. It continued along with a similar format, minus Don, up until July 2009 when the show was cancelled following the decision to turn WJFK into a sports talk station. Westwood One also continued to syndicate the show in its new lineup up until its cancellation. &quot;The Mike O&#x27;Meara Show&quot; took a 5-month hiatus and returned as a daily podcast in December. Don Geronimo broadcast out of Washington D.C. WJFK 106.7 The Fan for a brief stint in 2013. In April 2014, Geronimo joined former D&amp;M partner Buzz Burbank&#x27;s RELM Network to host his own podcast, &quot;The Don Geronimo Show&quot;, lasting only four months, citing RELM did not pay him. Burbank denied the claim, saying Geronimo &quot;was paid every penny he was owed to that point&quot;.

Geronimo now hosts and owns his own show.

<text>:&quot;See also Muwatalli I&quot;
Muwatalli II (also Muwatallis, or Muwatallish) was a king of the New Kingdom of the Hittite empire c. 1295–1282 (middle chronology) and 1295–1272 BC in the short chronology.

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of Mursili II and Queen Gassulawiya, and he had several siblings.

He is best known for relocating the Hittite capital to Tarhuntassa, appointing his brother Hattusili as governor in Hattusa, and fighting Ramesses II in the Battle of Kadesh.

A copy of a treaty has been recovered between him and Alaksandu, ruler of Wilusa (Troy), one of the Arzawa lands.

Egyptologists suspect that some time prior to Ramesses II&#x27;s accession to the Egyptian throne, Muwattalli had reached an informal peace treaty or understanding with Seti I over Kadesh to avoid a clash between the two powers over control of Syria. In it, Seti effectively ceded Kadesh to the Hittite king in order to focus on domestic issues in Egypt.

Muwatalli had a wife named Tanu-Ḫepa and at least two children. One was Urhi-Teshup, who became king as Mursili III until his uncle Hattusili III deposed him. Another was Kurunta who became the vassal ruler of Tarhuntassa during the reign of Hattusili III. Another person named Ulmi-Teshup is suggested to be a third son of Muwatalli II, but it is quite likely that Ulmi-Teshup and Kurunta are the same person.

Tudhaliya IV and Egyptian Queen Maathorneferure were the nephew and niece of Muwatalli.

Muwatalli&#x27;s namesake, Muwatalli I, was a pre-Empire king of the early 14th century, the predecessor of Tudhaliya I.

== Move to Tarhuntassa ==
At the start of Muwatalli II&#x27;s reign the capital of Hatti was Hattusa, located in the northern region of Anatolia. Not long after he came into power, he made the decision to move the capital to a new location, which he named Tarhuntassa. There is no documentation stating the reason why the capital was moved, but scholars, based on later texts written by his brother Hattusili III and the campaigns Muwatalli II fought, have come up with two possible reasons.

The first theory is that Muwatlli II moved the capital because of the border skirmishes between the Hittites and the Kaska, and later the rebellion by Piyamaradu. These disputes were on the northern border, and the capital of Hattusa is located near the northern border. After stabilizing the northern border, he moved the capital farther south, to the new location of Tarhuntassa. This new location was not only farther away from the troublesome northern border, but it was also strategically better for the upcoming fight against Egypt over Syria.

The second theory of why Muwatalli II moved his capital south is for religious reasons. Itamar Singer, in his essay “The Failed Reforms of Akhenaten and Muwatalli” states that the reason for the move had deeper roots in a religious reform, although he does acknowledge the political advantages of the move. The main evidence for this is how the depiction of the Storm God on his royal seals changes significantly after the expulsion of Danuhepa. Muwatalli II introduces a new motif for seals that is followed by all the Hittite kings that rule after him: the &quot;Umarmungsszene&quot; (German) (the protective embrace of the deity). This style is identifiable because it shows the king being embraced by one (or more) gods. In Muwatalli II&#x27;s seals, he is being embraced by the Storm God of Lightning (Pihassassa) instead of the traditional Storm God of Heaven (Teshub).

This move would eventually lead to a bitter civil war after Muwatalli&#x27;s death.

== Sirkeli relief ==
The relief of Muwatalli II is located near Sirkeli Höyük, which is one of the largest settlement mounds in Plain Cilicia. The settlement is situated on the left bank of the Ceyhan River, known in ancient times as Puruna or Pyramos.

The inscription of the king mentions also the name of his father Mursili II: “Muwattalli, Great King, the Hero, son of Mursili, Great King, the Hero”. He wears a long robe and, in his left hand, he holds the &quot;kalmus&quot; (lituus). The appearance of King Muwattalli is consistent with the way the Sun God of Heaven (&quot;Nepisas Istanu&quot;, or &quot;Simige&quot;) was portrayed in Hittite iconography; so this indicates deification.

A second, very similar relief is a few meters away, but it was partially destroyed in antiquity. The nature of the damage indicates a deliberate destruction, so that the name of this figure could not be read.

This figure is probably Urḫi-Teššup, whose throne name was Muršili (III). He became the king of Hatti after the death of his father Muwatalli II, but was overthrown 7 years later by his uncle Hattušili III.

These reliefs were probably directly visible to the people entering the ancient town, and dominated the landscape. But because the course of the river kept changing over the centuries, currently the reliefs are not so easily visible to visitors.

During the Hittite period, Sirkeli Höyük may have been the cult town of Kummanni.

== Battle of Kadesh ==
=== Overview ===
Muwatalli II is best known as the Hittite ruler who fought Ramesses II to a standstill at the Battle of Kadesh. Among his allies was Talmi-Sharruma, grandson of Suppiluliumas I, who was the king of Aleppo.

Although both sides claimed victory in this war, scholars generally believe that the battle ended badly for both sides, especially Ramesses II. This is because both sides suffered heavy losses and their military strength was reduced. What makes this battle unique is not how it ended, but that out of all the battles that Ramses II fought during his reign, he gave special attention to this battle. This is evident by the fact that he produced two official versions of the battle: the Literary Record, sometimes referred to as the Poem, and the Pictorial Record, which includes the Bulletin, a short record of the battle and carved images. These two depictions of the battle are found inscribed in five different Egyptian temples, including the Ramesseum. The second thing that makes this battle noteworthy is the tactics that Muwatalli II used against the Egyptian Army.

The general outline of the battle is this: Muwatlli II gathered his troops in northern Syria and sent out scouts and spies to ascertain the location of Ramesses II army. The spies reached Ramesses II and the division of Amun, when he was first approaching Kadesh. The spies, pretending to be deserters, gained the ear of Ramses II. They used this to convince him that the Hittite army was over hundred miles away in Aleppo. Sometime later, other Hittite scouts were caught, and Ramesses II discovered the ruse: Muwatalli II was right outside of Kadesh with his forces.

The battle began when the Hittite forces attacked the Egyptian army that was marching towards Kadesh. Ramses II, at his camp in Kadesh, had gone ahead of his other divisions and only had one division of his army with him. While the division to the south of Ramses II was being attacked by one attachment of Hittite charioteers, Muwatalli II had sent a second division of charioteers to attack Ramses II camp. Ramses II forces managed to fend off the Hittite attack and “win” the battle on the following day. 
==== Egyptian account ====
The two accounts that Ramses II created of the battle depict it as an epic struggle against the Hittite army, where Ramses II shows off his prowess as a brilliant military leader. In the shorter Bulletin, Muwatalli II is frequently described as “the vile Chief of Khatti.” Ramses II admits to having heard the false reports of Muwatalli II&#x27;s whereabouts, but when he discovers where Muwatalli II&#x27;s forces really are, he claims that “His majesty slaughtered them in their places; they sprawled before his horses; and his majesty was alone, no other was with him.” In the longer Poem, Ramesses II again calls Muwatalli II the “vile foe of Khatti” but in this version he also depicts Muwatalli II as being afraid of him, saying “the vile Chief of Khattii stood in the midst of the army that was with him and did not come out to fight for fear of his majesty” and “the wretched Chief of Khatti stood among his troops and chariots… stood turning, shrinking, afraid.” The Poem and Bulletin both end with Ramesses II winning a stunning victory over Muwatalli II and the Poem ends with Muwatalli signing a peace treaty with Ramesses II out of fear.

Despite the enthusiastic depiction of the battle by Ramesses II, scholars have concluded that the battle was a disaster for Ramesses II. This is because after the battle, Muwatalli II continued to expand into Syria and the Egyptian expansion was stopped in the area of Palestine.

<text>&quot;Seinfeld&quot; is an American television sitcom created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. &quot;Seinfeld&quot; has been described by some as a &quot;show about nothing&quot;, similar to the self-parodying &quot;show within a show&quot; of fourth-season episode &quot;The Pilot&quot;. Jerry Seinfeld is the lead character and played as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment block on New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side, the show features a host of Jerry&#x27;s friends and acquaintances, which include George Costanza, Elaine Benes, and Cosmo Kramer, who are portrayed by Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards, respectively.

The series debuted on July 5, 1989, on NBC, as &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;. The pilot episode was met with poor reviews, and as a result, NBC passed on the show. However, NBC executive Rick Ludwin believed the series had potential and therefore gave &quot;Seinfeld&quot; a budget to create four more episodes, which formed the rest of season 1 and began airing on May 31, 1990. The first season is considered the smallest sitcom order in television history. During its nine-year run, 180 episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; were produced. The count includes both halves of three one-hour episodes, including the finale, and two retrospective episodes, each split into two parts: &quot;The Highlights of 100&quot;, covering the first 100 episodes; and &quot;The Clip Show&quot;, also known as &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, which aired before the series finale. On November 25, 2004, a special titled &quot;The Seinfeld Story&quot; was broadcast. This marked the first appearance of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; on NBC since its series finale in 1998. All nine seasons are available on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray, and, as of 2025, the show is still re-run regularly in syndication. The final episode aired on May 14, 1998. The streaming rights for all 180 episodes of the series transferred from Hulu to Netflix in 2021.

<doc id="1070854" wikidata="Q316840" url="?curid=1070854" title="Tudḫaliya I">
<text>Tudḫaliya I (sometimes considered identical with Tudḫaliya II and called Tudḫaliya I/II ) was a Hittite great king in the 15th century BC, ruling perhaps c. 1465–c. 1440 BC 

== Identity ==
The numbering of Hittite kings named Tudḫaliya (Hittite: 𒌅𒌓𒄩𒇷𒅀 &quot;Tūdḫaliya&quot;) varies between scholars because of debate over the identity (or not) between the first two bearers of the name. This Tudḫaliya, now attested as the son of a certain Kantuzzili, succeeded Muwatalli I, after the latter was murdered by the officials Ḫimuili and Kantuzzili (not necessarily identical to Tudḫaliya&#x27;s father). The same or a distinct Tudḫaliya was the father-in-law and predecessor of Arnuwanda I. Because of uncertainty, scholars are divided in the interpretation of the evidence. Many scholars envision a single Tudḫaliya (I or I/II ), while others consider two separate kings, Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II. 

The rationale for maintaining a distinction between the two is presented by Jacques Freu, who notes, inter alia, that Tudḫaliya I was the son of the non-reigning Kantuzzili, while Tudḫaliya II writes that he ascended the throne as a youth after his father&#x27;s death; similarly, his sister Ziplantawiya was the daughter of a king. Additionally, Freu posits that the Šunaššura Treaty between the Hittite Kingdom and Kizzuwatna reflects successive equal and unequal treaty arrangements under two different sets of kings on both sides, discerns three Tudḫaliyas as predecessors of Muršili II on his &quot;cruciform seal,&quot; and argues that the Tudḫaliyas who engaged in repeated military action in Syria and in western Anatolia should be distinguished from each other to avoid an overly long reign.

The treatment below tentatively follows Freu&#x27;s distinction of two 15th-century BC Hittite great kings named Tudḫaliya.

== Family ==
Tudḫaliya I was the son of a certain Kantuzzili, who is not known to have reigned or to have descended from an earlier Hittite monarch. Most scholars readily assume that this Kantuzzili was identical to the Commander of the Golden Squires Kantuzzili, who (together with his apparent brother, the Chief Cupbearer Ḫimuili) murdered the preceding king, Muwatalli I, and also with the general Kantuzzili, who assisted Tudḫaliya I in repelling a Hurrian invasion in support of Muwatalli&#x27;s Commander of the Guard Muwa. On the other hand, Jacques Freu opposes the identification of Tudḫaliya&#x27;s father Kantuzilli with the regicide Kantuzilli on the grounds of consistent contextual incompatibility between their attestations in the sources, but allows for the possibility that he is identical to the general who fought the Hurrians. Prior to the publication of the seal impression naming Kantuzilli as Tudḫaliya&#x27;s father, Stefano De Martino suggested that the regicides Ḫimuili and Kantuzzili were Tudḫaliya&#x27;s sons, who had placed their father on the throne. Onofrio Carruba and Freu propose that Tudḫaliya&#x27;s mother was Walanni, attested in the royal offerings lists, and who might have been a daughter of the earlier king Zidanta II. It is also sometimes conjectured that Tudḫaliya was a grandson of the earlier king Ḫuzziya. Freu suggested that Tudḫaliya I was married to the obscure great queen Kattešḫapi attested at about this time, and was the father of a short-lived Ḫattušili II and the grandfather of Tudḫaliya II.

If Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II were one and the same individual, his queen would have been Nikkal-mati, his daughter Ašmu-Nikkal, and his son-in-law and successor, Arnuwanda I.

== Reign ==
Tudḫaliya I ascended the throne on the murder of his predecessor Muwatalli I, possibly in c. 1465 BC. Tudḫaliya appears to have pardoned and purified the regicides, the brothers Ḫimuili and Kantuzzili, although their relation to him remains obscure. Muwattali&#x27;s Commander of the Guard, Muwa, may have murdered a queen in retribution, and then attempted to stage a revolution with the help of Hurrians led by Kartašura. King Tudḫaliya and his general Kantuzzili (the regicide? the king&#x27;s father?) defeated the enemy.

Having secured his eastern flank, Tudḫaliya I apparently decided to assert himself in the south. According to Freu&#x27;s reconstruction of the evidence, he was responsible for the earlier, equal treaty between a Hittite king and Šunaššura I of Kizzuwatna, which allowed the king of Kizzuwatna full freedom to support the Hittite king against his enemies or remain neutral; the Hittites&#x27;s primary objective at this point might have been securing unimpeded passage into Syria. Partly on the basis of the Middle Hittite language of the text, Freu argues that during the subsequent southern assertion of Hittite power, the Hittite king concluded the so-called Kuruštama Treaty with Egypt, whose king at that time, Thutmose III (1479–1425 BC) had been active in northern Syria and at one time reached the Euphrates. Additionally, Freu believes that Tudḫaliya concluded unequal treaties with the petty rulers of Alalaḫ/Mukiš, Emar/Aštata, and Nuhašše, all now lost or very fragmentary, as in the case of his treaty with Tunip on the Orontes. A much later source, the treaty between the Hittite great king Muršili II and his nephew, Talmi-Šarruma of Aleppo, related Tudḫaliya&#x27;s conclusion of a treaty with Aleppo. When Aleppo abandoned its alliance with Tudḫaliya in favor of Mittani, Tudḫaliya defeated Aleppo and its Mittanian allies and destroyed the city. 

If Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II were one and the same individual, the wars of Tudḫaliya II in western and northern Anatolia would also pertain to this reign. See Tudḫaliya II.


== In the Bible ==
A number of modern biblical scholars believe that either Tudhaliya I, or the proto-Hittite Tudhaliya, was the same individual as &quot;Tidal, king of Nations&quot;, who is mentioned in the Book of Genesis as having joined Chedorlaomer in attacking rebels in Canaan.

<text>The Academic Karelia Society (&quot;Akateeminen Karjala-Seura&quot;, AKS) was a Finnish nationalist and Finno-Ugric activist organization aiming at the growth and improvement of newly independent Finland, founded by academics and students of the University of Finland in 1922. Its members retained influential positions in the academic life of the era as well as within the officer corps of the Army. The AKS controlled the student union of the University of Helsinki from the mid-1920s right up to 1944, when the Society was disbanded in the aftermath of the Continuation War.

== Ideological roots ==

The political and philosophical ideology of the AKS had its main roots in the philosophy of the 19th century Fennophile statesman Johan Vilhelm Snellman who emphasized a strong national state and the need of bringing the Finnish language into the forefront of the Finnish cultural life, which was dominated almost exclusively by the Swedish language. 

The nationalistic ideology of the AKS also stemmed from the common European discussion of national rights based on the Fourteen Points of President Woodrow Wilson. Also the experience of the Finnish Civil War bolstered a deep anti-socialist sentiment in the Finnish nationalist circles of that time. One of the slogans the AKS used was &quot;Pirua ja ryssää vastaan!&quot; (Against the devil and the Ruskies!) where the devil is referring to the Society&#x27;s main domestic enemies, the socialists and communists. Despite holding views close to the Fascist movement of Italy, there was no influence from abroad - the AKS was founded in February 1922 before the March on Rome and its origins were purely domestic. The group was founded by Elias Simojoki, Erkki Räikkönen and Reino Vähäkallio.

===Symbols===
A bullet was sewn in the black AKS flag, which was the same one that had killed Repola&#x27;s Lensmann Bobi Sivén (See: Aunus expedition). Sivén became a martyr of the AKS and had a cult of personality similar to that of Horst Wessel in Germany later on. Sivén was an example to the people of AKS of how the issue of Karelia is more important than one&#x27;s own life, as Sivén himself had said. 

Members of the AKS were sworn in before the black flag. From 1923, oaths were held twice a year, on Day of the Finnish Identity and Independence Day. In the spring of 1924, an oath was also introduced, which, in addition to the flag, became the AKS&#x27; second main rite.

The oath taken in front of the AKS black flag was as follows:

Under and to our flag I swear by all that is sacred and dear to me, to sacrifice my work and life to my Fatherland, to Finnish national awakening, for Karelia and Ingria, for Greater Finland. For as surely as I believe in one great God, I believe in Greater Finland and its great future.
== Karelia ==
Many of the founders of the AKS were veterans of the Karelian wars and thus had knowledge of the plight of the Karelian-speaking population in Soviet Karelia. The Karelians were considered to be a part of the Finnish &quot;heimo&quot; (folk) and their fate was of utmost importance for the AKS. The Academic Karelia Society&#x27;s program was centered around their main demand: the acquisition of East Karelia from Soviet Russia and the liberation of the Karelian kinfolk. The work towards this goal was mainly done by propagandist efforts to keep the matter in the public eye.

AKS also organized aid to Finnic minorities in Soviet Russia and refugees from there and promoted cultural efforts to help the Finnish-speaking minorities of northern Sweden and Norway. They also tried to cultivate friendship between the newly independent states of Finland and Estonia (and, to a lesser degree, Hungary).

== Domestic policies of the AKS ==
Domestically the AKS was an emphatic proponent for a strengthened army and for strict restrictions against Socialists, although it at the same time stressed the need of improving the lot of the working classes in the interest of the national community. It also promoted the rights of the Finnish language to become the first language in the country, especially in the Universities and in the bureaucracy of the state. Initially the group was ambiguous to democracy but under the chairmanship of Vilho Helanen it came to oppose the concept. Both chairmen of the AKS, Elmo Kaila and Helanen were involved with National Socialist groups.

In the 1930s, the AKS was an ally of the ultra-right Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement party. AKS also maintained close ties with a militant secret society called Vihan Veljet. Some authors claim that Vihan Veljet was actually a group inside the AKS, not a separate organization, but there is not much evidence either way.

== Legacy of the AKS ==
After the end of World War II, the organization was labeled &quot;fascistic&quot; and officially disbanded in September 1944 on the order of the Allied Control Commission. The archives of AKS, which were originally located in the New Student House in the heart of Helsinki, were hidden or destroyed by its members because they were considered insignificant at the time. They contained current correspondence, publicized materials, handwritten essays, writings related to the early stage of AKS&#x27;s activity.

Prominent former members include quite a few academics, bishops, business leaders, generals and politicians (e.g. president Urho Kekkonen). Many officers of the Finnish army during the wars of 1939–1940 and 1941–1944 were members of the Society. &quot;By 1966, 41 former members of AKS had the rank of a senior officer in the Finnish army.&quot; In 1968 seven of the nine bishops of Lutheran Church of Finland were former members of AKS.

Up to the 1970&#x27;s AKS influenced primarily on the cultural life of Finland according to Risto Alapuro.

<text>Mañón (), also registered in the past as &quot;Maañón&quot; , is a municipality in north-western Spain in the province of A Coruña, in the autonomous community of Galicia. It belongs to the comarca of Ortegal. Ferrolterra&#x27;s population represents the third largest concentration of people in Galicia, and its disperse population exceeds 211,000 (2005).

== &quot;O Barqueiro&quot; and &quot;Estaca de Bares&quot; Ports ==
* Fishing port
* Sport port

== Geography, history and general information ==

Mañón belongs to the Ferrolterra region of Ortegal and it is made up by five parishes, with 2,032 inhabitants, who are disseminated over its 82.1 km².

This council forms a narrow and long band of land that joins mountain, river and sea. The fertile freshwater of the river Sor ploughs its rugged lands from south to north. 

The mountainous alignments of the &quot;Serra da Faladoira&quot; and &quot;Serra da Coriscada&quot;, the valleys of the Sor river and its estuary, and the peninsula that forms Estaca de Bares offers a very attractive landscape and of exceptional natural value.

At monumental level, they emphasize the prehistoric rest like &quot;mámoas&quot; of Estaca de Bares and the possibly prehistoric (built in the Middle Ages according to other sources) port; in addition to Roman necropolis in A Ponte do Porto.

Some of its parochial churches are worthy of mention considering its rusticity and integration to the surroundings.

Mañón has a very particular geographical structure and the river Sor ploughs deep valleys with plenty of vegetation, which contrasts with the leafy high areas of the mountain range. The serpent shapes drawn by the Sor and its tributaries along their courses form a succession of inserted meanders, which form valleys with a lot of vegetation, where we can see rapid and beautiful waterfalls.
The weather is wet oceanic and the mild winters are followed by fresh summers. The rainfall is particularly abundant, but due to the relief, there are local microweathers, as happens in the banks of the river Sor, where the vegetation is partially responsible for the weather changes.
These physical and weather conditions, as well as its privileged situation between two seas, made Estaca de Bares to be declared &#x27;natural area of national interest&#x27;, and more recently, a protected area.

<doc id="1070859" wikidata="Q316078" url="?curid=1070859" title="Šuppiluliuma II">
<text>Šuppiluliuma II (), the son of Tudḫaliya IV, was the last certain great king of the New Kingdom of the Hittite Empire, contemporary with Tukulti-Ninurta I of the Middle Assyrian Empire. His reign began around 1207 BC (short chronology) and ended at an unknown later date. 

His name is usually spelled &quot;Šuppiluliama&quot; in contemporary primary sources, though modern scholars generally adopt the spelling used by his ancestor Šuppiluliuma I.

==Life and reign==

A younger son of the Hittite great king Tudḫaliya IV, Šuppiluliuma II succeeded his elder brother, Arnuwanda III, on the throne in c. 1207 BC. The new king exacted oaths of allegiance from his court and subjects, advertising his loyalty to his deceased older brother and his own legitimacy in the absence of any heirs of his predecessor. Without providing specifics, the surviving texts suggest a context of disloyalty and potential challenges to the throne by members of the extended royal family.

Šuppiluliuma II inherited what seems to have been a precarious situation inside and outside his kingdom. A royal official (titled &quot;king&#x27;s son&quot;), Piḫawalwi, was charged with writing to the vassal king of Ugarit, Ibiranu, to chastise him for failing to demonstrate his respects to Šuppiluliuma II. The vassal king of Carchemish, Talmi-Teššub, a member of the Hittite royal house, was apparently bound with a new treaty to the Hittite great king and left in charge of affairs in Syria; he would later supervise a divorce settlement between the great king&#x27;s daughter Eḫli-Nikkal and King Ammurapi of Ugarit. Šuppiluliuma II corresponded with the contemporary king of Assyria, presumably Tukulti-Ninurta I, but the tablets are not well preserved.
Military campaigns during the reign of Šuppiluliuma II are known from two inscriptions in Hieroglyphic Luwian. They record wars against former vassal Tarḫuntašša, and against Alašiya (Cyprus). One inscription is found at the base of Nişantepe in the Upper City of Hattusa; the other is located on the northern corner of the East Pond (Pond 1), in what is known as Chamber 2. This served as a water reservoir for Hattusa and is described as a symbolic entrance to the Netherworld.

The Chamber 2 reliefs and inscription are historically important since they record the political instability which plagued Hatti during Šuppiluliuma II&#x27;s reign. The inscriptions relate the great king&#x27;s conquests of the lands of Wiyanawanda, Tamina, Maša (Mysia?), Lukka (Lycia and/or Lycaonia?), and Ikuna (Konya?), all of them in or near the territory of the Lukka in southwestern Anatolia. Following these successes, the inscription relates that Šuppiluliuma II attacked the hostile regime in Tarḫuntašša, a Hittite city that had briefly served as the Empire&#x27;s political capital during the reign of Muwatalli II; Tarḫuntašša was defeated, sacked, and annexed by the great king. Inscriptions of an obscure great king Ḫartapu, son of a great king Muršili, with stylistic similarity to those of Tudḫaliya IV, found west of Konya, offer a possible identification for Šuppiluliuma II&#x27;s enemy in Tarḫuntašša, if the Muršili in question could be equated with Muršili III (Urḫi-Teššub).

Reasserting Hittite central control over southern Anatolia and its coasts might have been more than a matter of pride, as suggested by references to urgent grain shipments from Merneptah, the king of Egypt, and from Mukiš in northern Syria. This and other indicators suggest a famine in Anatolia or more broadly the Eastern Mediterranean region in the late 13th century BC. 

Following an earlier invasion of Alašiya (Cyprus) during the reign of his father, a fleet under the command of Šuppiluliuma II defeated either the Cypriots or a group of the so-called Sea Peoples who had established themselves on the island, the first recorded naval battle in history. According to some historians (Claude Schaeffer, Horst Nowacki, Wolfgang Lefèvre), this and following victories in Cyprus were probably won by using Ugaritic ships.

The Sea Peoples had already begun their advance along the Mediterranean coastline, apparently starting from the Aegean, and continuing all the way to Canaan, some of them settling in Philistia and at Dor. In the process, they seem to have taken Cilicia and Cyprus from the Hittites, cutting off their coveted trade routes. Based on records from Ugarit, the threat had originated in the west, and the Hittite king asked for assistance from Ugarit.
: The enemy [advances(?)] against us and there is no number [...]. Our number is pure(?) [. . .] Whatever is available, look for it and send it to me.

Šuppiluliuma II was probably the ruler who abandoned the capital city of Hattusa, possibly contributing to the fall or disappearance of the Hittite kingdom. Some scholars indicate that Šuppiluliuma II&#x27;s end is unknown or that he simply &quot;vanished&quot;, while some claim he was killed during the sack of Hattusa in 1190 BC. The violent end of Hattusa as the Hittite capital is now doubted, and it is suspected that Šuppiluliuma II, like Tudḫaliya III before him, moved his residence and court elsewhere, perhaps to the southwest; unlike Tudḫaliya III, however, neither Šuppiluliuma II nor any of his potential successors ever reestablished themselves at Hattusa, and the Hittite Empire disappeared as such.

The Hittite kingdom collapsed, or at least underwent an irreversible negative transformation at the end of the reign of Šuppiluliuma II. The reasons for this are unclear and might have combined various natural phenomena (including droughts and earthquakes) with internal and external strife or political and military pressures. If Hattusa was not destroyed by violence at this point, but was only partly abandoned, a violent destruction of what remained might have happened a little later. Perhaps the Kaška, the traditional enemies of Hatti in the north took over the old Hittite capital. What was left of Hattusa was destroyed by fire, its site only re-occupied by a Phrygian fortress some 500 years later. Kuzi-Teššub, a ruler of Carchemish, would later assume the title of &quot;Great King&quot; since he was a direct descendant of Šuppiluliuma I.

==Possible successors==
Although Šuppiluliuma II is generally considered the last great king of Hatti, it has been suggested that he had at least one successor, possibly his son, Tudḫaliya V. This hypothesis was proposed by Zsolt Simon after analyzing a Luwian inscription on a silver bowl in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, its inscription reading in part
: Asamaya, the Hittite, himself offered this bowl before King Maza-Karḫuḫa. When Tudḫaliya, the Labarna, defeated the land of Tarawazi/Tariwiza, that year he did it.

Simon determined that earlier proposals that identified the great king (Labarna) Tudḫaliya with any of the known great kings of that name were mistaken, due to the date of the inscription suggested by the epigraphy. Kings Tudḫaliya I through III were excluded due to the inscription&#x27;s syllabic spelling, royal titulary formula, character inventory, Kings Tudḫaliya I and II by its language (Luwian), King Tudḫaliya IV by the syllabic spelling, the mention of a vassal king Maza-Karḫuḫa, and the formula Tudḫaliya Labarna, while any King Tudḫaliya of Carchemish was excluded by the title Labarna and the label &quot;man of the Land of Hatti.&quot; Accordingly, Simon posited that the Labarna Tudḫaliya of the Ankara silver bowl would be best identified as the successor of Šuppiluliuma II, close in time but later than Tudḫaliya IV, and contemporary to Maza-Karḫuḫa in northern Syria (Carchemish?). As Šuppiluliuma II is known to have had a son (unnamed in the sources), it is natural to suppose that he would be named, or would assume the name, of his grandfather Tudḫaliya IV. Considering and dismissing Ḫartapu and the kings of Carchemish, Simon speculated on the possibility that the line of Hittite great kings survived as the Iron Age great kings of Tabal. This interpretation has found support from Jacques Freu.

<text>Guitiriz () is a municipality in the province of Lugo, in the autonomous community of Galicia, northwestern Spain. It belongs to the comarca of Terra Chá. It is known for its spa of mineral water. Prior to 1950, the town was known as Trasparga.

== Etymology ==
The name Guitiriz is of Germanic origin. It is derived from the name Witteric; a Suebi king who ruled Gallaecia, Hispania and Septimania. According to local legends, Witteric founded Guitiriz in the 6th century.

== History and tourism ==

Though the early settlers were of Celtic origin and the Romans knew about the therapeutic properties of the thermae, it was not till the arrival of the Suebi after the collapse of the Roman Empire that this Spa Town became really popular for the first time in the 6th century. The name &quot;Guitiriz&quot; is derived from &quot;Witirici&quot;, the Latin genitive of Witiricus meaning &quot;the place owned by Witiricus&quot; (i.e.: Witiricus the Suebi warlord).

In the 14th century the entire Terra Chá Region (including Guitiriz and its capital Villalba) ended up as part of the domains of Fernán Pérez de Andrade whose family were to become the First Counts of Villalba during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs.

Amongst other remains in the area is a well conserved medieval fortification, the Castle of Parga, and a Gothic bridge.

<doc id="1070868" wikidata="Q685693" url="?curid=1070868" title="Hermunduri">
<text>The Hermunduri, Hermanduri, Hermunduli, Hermonduri, or Hermonduli were an ancient Germanic tribe, who occupied an inland area near the source of the Elbe river, around what is now Bohemia from the first to the third century, though they have also been speculatively associate with Thuringia further north. According to an old proposal based on the similarity of the names, the Thuringii may have been the descendants of the Hermunduri. At times, they apparently moved to the Danube frontier with Rome. Claudius Ptolemy mentions neither tribe in his geography but instead the Teuriochaemae, who may also be connected to both.

==History==
Strabo treats the Hermunduri as a nomadic Suebian people, living east of the Elbe.
:Now as for the tribe of the Suevi, it is the largest, for it extends from the Rhenus [Rhine] to the Albis [Elbe]; and a part of them even dwell on the far side of the Albis [Elbe river], as, for instance, the Hermondori and the Langobardi; and at the present time these latter, at least, have, to the last man, been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river. 

Cassius Dio first reports that in the year 1 AD, a Roman named Domitius (possibly Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC)), &quot;while still governing the districts along the Ister [Danube], had intercepted the Hermunduri, a tribe which for some reason or other had left their own land and were wandering about in quest of another, and he had settled them in a part of the Marcomannian territory&quot;; then he had crossed the Albis [Elbe river], meeting with no opposition, had made a friendly alliance with the barbarians on the further side, and had set up an altar to Augustus on the bank of the river.

Velleius Paterculus also described their position:
:The power of the Langobardi was broken, a race surpassing even the Germans in savagery; and finally — and this is something which had never before been entertained even as a hope, much less actually attempted — a Roman army with its standards was led four hundred miles beyond the Rhine as far as the river Elbe, which flows past the territories of the Semnones and the Hermunduri.

Pliny the elder, in his &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;, lists the Hermunduri as one of the nations of the Hermiones, all descended from the same line of descent from Mannus. In the same category he places the Chatti, Cherusci, and Suebi.

In his &quot;Germania&quot;, Tacitus describes the Hermunduri after listing some of the Suebian nations, placing them near the Danube, and the sources of the Elbe:
:Nearer to us is the state of the Hermunduri (I shall follow the course of the Danube as I did before that of the Rhine), a people loyal to Rome. Consequently they, alone of the Germans, trade not merely on the banks of the river, but far inland, and in the most flourishing colony of the province of Rætia. Everywhere they are allowed to pass without a guard; and while to the other tribes we display only our arms and our camps, to them we have thrown open our houses and country-seats, which they do not covet. It is in their lands that the Elbe takes its rise, a famous river known to us in past days; now we only hear of it. —Tac. Ger. 41

In his &quot;Annales&quot;, Tacitus recounts how the Hermundurian Vibilius in 18 AD led the overthrow of the Marcomannic king Catualda in favor of the Quadian Vannius. Around 50 AD, allied with Vannius&#x27; nephews Vangio and Sido and allied Lugii, Vibilius led the deposition of Vannius as well. In 58 AD the Hermunduri defeated the Chatti in a border dispute over a religiously significant river.

The Hermunduri shared a disputed border with the Chatti, along a river with salt reserves near it, possibly the Werra or the Saxon Saale. The Hermunduri won this conflict.

When Marcus Aurelius died in 180 AD, he was involved in conflict with an alliance of the Marcomanni, the Hermunduri, the Sarmatians, and the Quadi.

Some have suggested that the remnants of the Hermanduri went on to become the Thuringii, arguing that (&quot;-duri&quot;) could represent corrupted (&quot;-thuri&quot;) and the Germanic suffix &quot;-ing&quot;, suggests a meaning of &quot;descendants of (the [Herman]duri)&quot;. This has been argued against by other scholars such as Matthias Springer.

<text>Hattusili III (Hittite: &quot;from Hattusa&quot;) was king of the Hittite empire (New Kingdom) –1245 BC (middle chronology) or 1267–1237 BC (short chronology timeline).

==Early life and family==

Much of what is known about the childhood of Hattusili III is gathered from a biographical account, written on a stone tablet during his reign, referred to as the &quot;Apology&quot;. Hattusili III was born the youngest of four children to the Hittite king Mursili II and queen Gassulawiya. According to Hattusili III himself, he was an ill and sickly child who was initially expected not to survive to adulthood. Hattusili III credited the goddess Ishtar with saving his life during this period, and would remain an ardent patron of Ishtar indefinitely. Due to his place as the youngest son, Hattusili III did not become king after the death of his father. Instead his older brother Muwattalli II ascended the throne.

Before becoming king, Hattusili III married Puduhepa, a priestess of Ishtar, who later became an important Hittite queen in her own right. With Puduhepa, Hattusili III had three children, including his successor Tudhaliya IV.

==Reign==
===Rise to kingship===

====Reign of Muwatalli II====
When his brother Muwattalli II became king, Hattusili III was appointed to govern over the northern lands of the Hittite empire. While this initially caused minor controversy among the locals and the ousted governor, Hattusili III was quick to quash dissidence with military force and turned his eyes towards conquering new territories surrounding the northern Hittite lands. When the King made the decision to move the capital from Hattusa to Tarhuntassa, Hattusili III was left to quash the rebellions that arose due to this decision. Subsequently, Hattusili III was made King of the northern territories by his brother Muwattalli II.

====Reign of Mursili III====
Upon the death of Muwattalli II, Hattusili III&#x27;s nephew Urhi-Teshub became king. There was controversy with this appointment, because Urhi-Teshub was the son of Muwattalli&#x27;s concubine, not his wife. Despite his origins as a &quot;second-rank son&quot;, Hattusili III initially supported Urhi-Teshub&#x27;s kingship as it was the wish of Muwatalli II that Urhi-Teshub should rule. Urhi-Teshub ruled under the name Mursili III. Shortly after his accession to the throne, Mursili III had the capital moved from Tarhuntassa back to its original home of Hattussa. This effectively reduced much of Hattusili&#x27;s power in the region and nullified his role as king of the northern territories. Hattusili III was also stripped of all of his territories aside from Hapkis and Nerik. This strained the relationship greatly, and upon having Nerik stripped of him as well, Hattusili III sought to usurp the throne.

===Great King of Hatti===
After deposing Mursili III as king, Hattusili III exiled him to Syria. Hattusili III appointed Muwattalli II&#x27;s other son Kurunta, whom he himself had raised, to govern Tarhuntassa in a similar capacity that Hattusili III himself had once held.

As king, Hattusili III sought to keep a correspondence with many different kingships in the surrounding areas. After his ascension to the throne, Hattusili III began a correspondence with Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II that culminated in the first ever recorded peace treaty, the Eternal Treaty (also known as the Treaty of Kadesh). This correspondence took place roughly fifteen years after the Battle of Kadesh.

Hattusili&#x27;s reign as king is notable for the large collection of letters and written accounts unearthed from this period. Over two-hundred letters were unearthed at the site of the royal palace in Hattusa. These primary sources, including &quot;The Apology,&quot; the Tawagalawa letter, and the Arzawa letters, are considered among the very few primary sources available from the Hittite empire of the time.

<text>Halliwell Jones Stadium is a rugby league stadium in Warrington, England, which is the home ground of the Warrington Wolves. It has also staged Challenge Cup semi-finals, the European Nations Final, the National League Grand Finals&#x27; Day, two games of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup and four games of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.

== History ==
===1990s–2004: Origins and construction===
By the late 1990s, Warrington&#x27;s Wilderspool Stadium had become decrepit and unfit for purpose, and so the club looked to move to a new stadium. Before settling on a site just north of the town centre, which had formerly housed the Tetley Walker brewery, a site in Burtonwood was considered but these plans were rejected.

Ground was broke at the new site in 2002 and bucked the common trend of modern stadia by including terracing areas rather than being an all-seater stadium, with the South and West stands both containing terracing It also has enormous pitch dimensions of 120 m x 74 m, as requested by Warrington&#x27;s head coach of the time, Paul Cullen, due to his desire to play expansive rugby. The stadium officially opened in 2004.

===2011–present: Expansion===
During the 2010 Championship Grand Final between Featherstone Rovers and Halifax, a fire beneath the terraced West Stand broke out, forcing all of the fans housed in the stand to be evacuated onto the field, holding up the game for around 45 minutes. Following a safety inspection the spectators were eventually allowed back in. However, when the smell of smoke failed to disperse, there was a further hold up as the fans were moved to the East Stand. The game resumed with no further interruptions. The fire was treated as arson.

On 3 March 2011, the club announced that the corners of the East Stand at the stadium would be filled in to create a further 2,000 spaces made up of seating and terracing for the 2012 season. The stadium capacity, set at 15,000 for the first sell-out home match against St. Helens in 2012, was increased to 15,200 and can grow to 15,693 as the club proves it can handle the bigger crowds and get extra safety certificates. The club has also announced plans to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to around 22,000 should the need arise. The largest ever crowd at the Halliwell Jones was recorded on 14 April 2023, with a record crowd of 15,026 were in attendance.

The club announced that for just the opening game of the 2025 season, the stadium would be renamed the Luke Littler stadium, in honour of the World Darts champion who is a life long Warrington supporter.

== Brian Bevan monuments ==

Two monuments to Australian winger and world record try scorer Brian Bevan, who played for Warrington 1945–62 (scoring 740 tries for the Wire), are featured at the stadium. One, a statue of him, had previously been placed in the middle of a roundabout (known as Brian Bevan island) close to Wolves&#x27; old Wilderspool ground. This was moved to the Halliwell Jones Stadium with the team. The other, a mural showing Bevan&#x27;s face made from &#x27;Primrose and Blue&#x27; bricks, the traditional Warrington colours was created specifically for the location.

Two other tributes to ex-players at the ground are the naming of the South-East quadrant the Jack Fish corner, and the road the stadium is on Mike Gregory Way.

==Layout==
===North Stand===
The North Stand is the main stand of the ground, housing hospitality, changing rooms and dugout.

===East Stand===

The East Stand is situated behind the goal posts and is an all seater stand with hospitality boxes. In 2011, the corners next to the stand were filled in to increase the capacity.

===South Stand===
The South Stand runs along the side of the pitch and is terraced. It also houses the scoreboard and TV gauntry.

===West Stand===
The West Stand is terraced and houses the away fans. Unlike the East Stand at the opposite end of the ground, the corners are not filled in but there are future plans to do so if there is demand for the capacity to be increased.

== Sponsorship ==
Halliwell Jones, which holds the naming rights for the stadium, is a large BMW and MINI motor group owned by Phillip Jones, a businessman from the North West.

== Usage ==
===Rugby league===
The stadium was primarily built as a rugby league venue and to be home of Warrington Wolves. It has also been used as a neutral venue on multiple occasions, the first being the Challenge Cup semi-finals since it opened in 2004:
After successfully hosting its first Challenge Cup semi final in 2004, the ground was also selected to hold the Championship Grand Final on five separate occasions between 2006 and 2011.
It 2015, Warrington were chosen to play in the inaugural World Club Series. The club chose to host the game at the Halliwell Jones rather than move it to a bigger venue.

The Halliwell Jones has also been a venue for international rugby league, hosting a European Cup and World Cup.
===Association football===
The Halliwell Jones was chosen as one of the venues to host the 2005 Women&#x27;s European Championship. In 2007, Liverpool chose the stadium to host their reserve team, who played there until 2009.
*Liverpool reserves (2007–09)
*2005 Women&#x27;s European Championship

===England&#x27;s strongest man ===
The Halliwell Jones was chosen as the venue to hold the England&#x27;s strongest man tournament in 2022 and 2023.

===Non-sporting events===
The Halliwell Jones held the Autumn Pops Concert with Three Sporting Tenors. In 2010, the ground was used to film an episode of Candy Cabs which aired in April 2011 on BBC One.

<doc id="1070874" wikidata="Q360197" url="?curid=1070874" title="Muršili III">
<text>Muršili III, also known as Urhi-Teshub, was a king of the Hittites who assumed the throne of the Hittite empire (New Kingdom) at Tarhuntassa upon his father&#x27;s death. He was a cousin of Tudhaliya IV and Queen Maathorneferure. He ruled ca. 1282–1275 BC (middle chronology) or 1272–1265 BC (short chronology).

== Biography ==

He was the eldest surviving son of Muwatalli II. He was a grandson of Muršili II.

During his reign, Muršili III reverted the capital from Tarhuntassa (as it had been under Muwatalli) back to Hattusa (KBo 21.15 i 11-12). However, the Assyrians captured Hanigalbat, which severely weakened his legitimacy to rule over the Hittite Empire. In his seventh year, Muršili III attacked and seized control of his uncle Hattusili&#x27;s regional strongholds of Hakpissa and Nerik within the Hittite Empire in order to remove Hattusili as a threat to the throne. Hakpissa served as the centre of Hattusili&#x27;s power while Nerik was under Hattusilis&#x27;s sway from the latter&#x27;s position as high priest there. Hattusili then states in a well-known text:

Consequently, Muršili III&#x27;s reign was seven years. In the subsequent revolt, Hatusilli gathered a considerable force. This included natural allies from his local strongholds of Nerik and Hakpissa, as well as many non-aligned Hittites who were impressed with his record of service to the Hittite Empire. His strategic military victory over Ramesses II of Egypt in the 1274 BC Battle of Kadesh was favourably contrasted with the rather &quot;undistinguished and largely unproven occupant of the throne of Hattusa&quot; – Urhi-Teshub/Muršili III – who had lost Hanigalbat to Assyria in his reign. Hattusili&#x27;s forces even included elements of the Kaska peoples who were sworn enemies of the Hittites. Hatusilli quickly defeated Muršili III and seized the throne from his nephew; he then succeeded to power as King Hattusili III. After his victory, Hattusili appointed Muršili&#x27;s brother or brother-in-law, Kurunta, as the vassal king over Tarhuntassa in order to win the latter&#x27;s loyalty.

Located near the village of Sirkeli Höyük, there&#x27;s a well known relief of Muwatalli II. A second, very similar relief was just a few meters away, but it was largely destroyed in antiquity. The nature of the damage indicates a deliberate destruction, so that the name of this figure could not be read. Nevertheless, it is believed to have been the relief of Muršili III, destroyed by his uncle as an act of &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot; (condemnation of memory).

Muršili fled to Egypt, the land of his country&#x27;s enemy, after the failure of his plots to oust his uncle from the throne. Hattusili III responded to this event by demanding that Ramesses II extradite his nephew back to Hatti.

This letter precipitated a crisis in relations between Egypt and Hatti when Ramesses denied any knowledge of Muršili&#x27;s whereabouts in his country and the two empires came dangerously close to war. However, both kings eventually decided to resolve the issue by making peace in Year 21 of Ramesses II. An extradition clause was also included in the treaty. Muršili III soon thereafter disappears from history after his sojourn in Egypt.

Muršili III seemingly had a son. A certain Hartapu calls himself a great king and son of the great king Muršili, who normally is identified with Muršili III. Hartapu likely has ruled Tarhuntassa in the 2nd half of the 13th century BC.

<text>Mopti (Fulfulde: Mobti) is a town and an urban commune in the Inner Niger Delta region of Mali. The town is the capital of the Mopti Cercle and the Mopti Region. Situated 630 km northeast of Bamako, the town lies at the confluence of the Niger and the Bani Rivers and is linked by an elevated causeway to the town of Sévaré. The urban commune, which includes both Mopti and Sévaré, had a population of 114,296 in the 2009 census.

==Geography==
Mopti lies on the right bank of the Bani River, a few hundred meters upstream of the confluence of the Bani with the Niger River. Between August and December when the rivers flood the Inner Niger Delta, the town becomes a series of islands connected by raised causeways. During this period the only road access to the town is along a 12 km causeway that links Mopti to Sévaré. Mopti lies to the west of the Dogon Plateau and is 66 km northwest of Bandiagara and 76 km north-northeast of Djenné. The town is the capital of the Mopti Region and the administrative center of the Mopti Cercle.

The urban commune of Mopti includes the towns of both Mopti and Sévaré. The commune is completely surrounded by the rural commune of Socoura. At the time of the 2009 census the population of the Mopti commune was 114,296. For administrative purposes the commune is subdivided into 11 &quot;quartiers&quot;: Komoguel I, Komoguel II, Gangal, Toguel, Bougoufié, Mossinkoré, Taïkiri, Médina Coura, Sévaré I, Sévaré II, and Sévaré III. The seat of the commune, the Hôtel de Ville de Mopti, is in Komoguel I.

==History==
The town of Mopti derives its name from the Fulfulde word for gathering. The name replaced the earlier Bozo name of &quot;Sagan&quot;. Unlike towns such as Djenné, Timbuktu and Gao, Mopti was a village until the French conquest at the end of the 19th century and did not play an important role in the history of the region.

In April 1828 the French explorer, René Caillié, stopped at Mopti on his journey by boat from Djenné to Timbuktu. In his account he described the village, which he called Isaca, as having 700-800 inhabitants with the houses constructed of sun-dried mud bricks. The inhabitants grew rice on the floodplains, herded livestock and fished with cotton nets. Large quantities of the dried fish were traded in Djenné and other markets. The women made a &quot;beautiful kind of pottery&quot; which they sold in Djenné and to boats heading for Timbuktu. Two centuries later, the cultivation of rice is still very important to the local economy, dried fish are exported over a large part of West Africa and pottery is still shipped from the port.

At the time of Caillié&#x27;s visit the village was part of the Massina Empire, controlled by Seku Amadu from his base at Hamdullahi, 21 km to the southeast. In 1862 Umar Tall captured Hamdullahi and for a short period the village became part of the Toucouleur Empire. In 1893 French forces under Louis Archinard occupied the region which then became part of the French Sudan.

At the time of the French conquest, Mopti consisted of several separate settlements on small areas of higher ground that remained above the water during the annual flood. French soldiers exploring the Niger on gunboats described Mopti as consisting of a pair villages on the bank of the river 2 km apart with a third village slightly inland.

According to the French colonial army officer, Capitaine Lucien Marc, in 1902 Mopti was a &quot;miserable village&quot; with a few huts. Between 1905 and 1912 the French colonial forces constructed a 12 km dyke connecting Mopti with Sévaré to allow access to the town by road when the Niger was in flood. The village expanded rapidly in the first decade of the 20th century, and by the 1930s the commercial area on the river and the Komoguel district had been developed. The French colonial administration initiated the rebuilding of the great mosque in 1933, basing the design on that of the Great Mosque of Djenné.

Due to the limited land available, Mopti became more densely built than most Malian cities with many multi-story buildings and narrow streets. Originally, the islands were much smaller than they are today; first linked by dykes in the early twentieth century, the areas around and between natural islands have been gradually filled and raised—often by deposition of household trash, a process that still continues today in areas such as the western edge of the Old Town.

In 2002, Mopti was one of several Malian cities to host the Cup of African Nations tournament. A large, modern stadium was constructed for this event.

During the 2012 Northern Mali Conflict, when Islamists took over most of Northern Mali, Mopti was one of the most northerly towns that remained under government control.

Amadou Toumani Touré, a former president of Mali, is a native of Mopti.

==Mosque==
The Great Mosque (also called the Komoguel Mosque) is an example of Sudano-Sahelian architecture. The present building was constructed on the site of an earlier mosque dating from 1908 but sources differ on the exact date. The web site of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention gives a period of between 1933 and 1935 while the Aga Khan Development Network gives the slightly later period of between 1936 and 1943. The design was based on that of the Great Mosque of Djenné and is constructed using sun-dried mud bricks which are covered with a layer of banco. In restoration work carried out in 1978, the upper parts of the building were covered with a layer of cement but this later proved to be problematic as rain water penetrated the cement layer and created large fissures in the underlying mud structure. In the restoration carried out between 2004 and 2006 funded by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, the cement layer was removed and the building restored to its original form. The mosque was added to the UNESCO Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in March 2009.

==Industry==

Mopti is the region&#x27;s commercial center and Mali&#x27;s most important port; markets around its harbour sell rock salt from Taoudenni, among many other goods. Fishing, herding, and agriculture (particularly rice production) also continue to be important to the local economy.

===Tourism===
Mopti is popular with tourists, having an active river port, a mosque, and across the Niger, small fishing villages. Attractions in Mopti include Mopti Grand Mosque and the nearby Pays Dogon. There are several popular hotels, the Hotel Kanaga, Hotel Y a pas de Problème, and Hotel Ambedjele which is on the road to Sévaré.

During the 2012 Northern Mali conflict, most Western tourists stayed away from the region, even though Mopti was not in rebel hands. However, the conflict had a mixed effect on the town as dispossessed people from the rebel-held area came to Mopti and boosted some parts of the economy.

==Transport==
The port of Mopti is served by ferries operated by the Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV). The ferries run between August and December when the depth of water in the river is sufficient. They carry both freight and passengers between Koulikoro (59 km downstream from Bamako) and Gao, a distance of 1308 km. Both passengers and freight are also transported by &quot;pinasses&quot;, large wooden canoe shaped vessels, that are privately operated.

Mopti is connected by a 12 km elevated causeway to Sévaré which lies on the Route Nationale 16 (RN16), the bitumen surfaced road that links Bamako in the west to Gao in the east. There is an airport at Sévaré.

==Culture==
The city is the subject of a 1999 documentary film, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit de Mopti&quot;. It is also the birthplace of Slovak celebrity Ibrahim Maiga.

==Demographics==

Many ethnic groups are present in the commune including Fula, Bozo, Bambara, Dogon, Songhai, Bobos and Mossis. The most spoken language is Fula followed by Bozo.

==Climate==
Mopti has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;). The town lies near the southern boundary of the Sahel region and the weather is hot to sweltering and arid throughout much of the year. Only December and January at the height of the dry season have average daily maximum temperatures below . Average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months of the year — April and May — exceed . Temperatures are slightly cooler, though still very hot, from June through September, when practically all of the annual rainfall occurs.

<doc id="1070876" wikidata="Q287259" url="?curid=1070876" title="Hamilton Harty">
<text>Sir Herbert Hamilton Harty (4 December 1879 – 19 February 1941) was an Irish composer, conductor, pianist and organist.

After an early career as a church organist in his native Ireland, Harty moved to London at about age 20, soon becoming a well-known piano accompanist. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; called him &quot;the prince of accompanists&quot;. As a composer he wrote throughout his career, many of his works being well received, though few are regularly performed in the 21st century.

In his career as a conductor, which began in 1904, Harty was particularly noted as an interpreter of the music of Berlioz. From 1920 to 1933 he was the chief conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, which he returned to the high standards and critical acclaim that it had enjoyed under its founder, Charles Hallé. His last permanent post was with the London Symphony Orchestra, but it lasted only two years, from 1932 to 1934. During his conducting career, Harty made some recordings with his orchestras. Shortly after his dismissal by the LSO, Harty began to suffer the symptoms of a brain tumour. After surgery, he resumed his career until 1940, but the tumour returned to cause his death at the age of 61.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Harty was born in Hillsborough, County Down, Ireland, the fourth of ten children of an Anglican (Church of Ireland) church organist, William Michael Harty (1852–1918), and his wife, Annie Elizabeth, the daughter of Joseph Hamilton Richards, a soldier from Bray, County Wicklow. Harty&#x27;s father taught him the viola, the piano and counterpoint, and, at the age of 12, he followed his father&#x27;s profession and was appointed organist of Magheragall Parish Church, County Antrim. He took further posts in his teenage years as a church organist in Belfast and Bray. While in the latter, he came under the influence of Michele Esposito, professor of piano at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, who encouraged him to pursue a career as a piano accompanist. As Bray is only 12 miles from Dublin, Harty was able go into the city to hear an orchestra for the first time in his life.

===Accompanist, composer and conductor===

In 1900 or 1901, Harty moved to London to further his career. The biographer Michael Kennedy wrote that Harty quickly became known both as &quot;a promising composer and as an outstanding accompanist.&quot; &quot;The Musical Times&quot; later called him &quot;the prince of accompanists&quot;. Of Harty&#x27;s early compositions, Kennedy singles out the Trio (1901) and Piano Quartet (1904) and the &quot;Comedy Overture&quot;, premiered at the Proms in 1907. &quot;The Times&quot; said of this piece:
Among those whom Harty accompanied in his early days in London was the soprano Agnes Nicholls, whom he married on 15 July 1904. In the same year, Harty made his debut as a conductor, in the first performance of his &quot;Irish Symphony&quot; by the Dublin Orchestral Society, at the Feis Ceoil music festival in Dublin. Reviewing the premiere, &quot;The Times&quot; called the piece, &quot;a work of much promise ... received with enthusiasm. It has many ideas, always freshly expressed, and the airs are developed with more than common variety and beauty.&quot; The following year, Harty&#x27;s arrangement of Irish songs was included alongside works of Stanford and Vaughan Williams at a recital by Harry Plunket Greene. Among Harty&#x27;s compositions from these years, Kennedy mentions a setting of Keats&#x27;s &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; (1907), a Violin Concerto (1908) dedicated to and premiered by Joseph Szigeti, the tone poem &quot;With the Wild Geese&quot; (1910) and the cantata &quot;The Mystic Trumpeter&quot; to words by Walt Whitman (1913).
Through his wife&#x27;s professional connections, Harty secured his first important conducting engagement in London. He conducted the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in a performance of &quot;With the Wild Geese&quot; in March 1911. The performance was well received, and Harty was engaged to conduct the LSO again during its 1912–13 season. Hoping to repeat his success as a composer-conductor, he gave the first performance of his &quot;Variations on a Dublin Air&quot; in February 1913. His concerts this time were not successful with the critics or the public, and the orchestra made a loss. Although the LSO did not invite him back for the next season, Harty was invited to conduct &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; at Covent Garden in 1913. His performance as an operatic conductor was less than a triumph. After &quot;Carmen&quot;, the critic of &quot;The Times&quot; complained that &quot;Mr Harty&#x27;s rigid beat and inflexible &quot;tempi&quot; petrified [the] delicate and fragile phrases, and made them sound like quotations from some forgotten German score&quot;. Harty later admitted that he was not greatly in sympathy with opera as a genre: &quot;Opera seems to me a form of art in which clumsy attempts are made at defining the indefinable suggestions of music. Or else one in which the author of a plot and his actors are hampered by music which prolongs their gestures and action to absurdity and obscures the sense of their words.&quot;

===Hallé Orchestra===
Returning to symphonic music, Harty conducted the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in January 1914, and in April he made his début with the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester. During the First World War he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and was posted for duties in the North Sea. He rose to the rank of lieutenant before being demobilised in June 1918. He resumed his association with the Hallé, replacing the indisposed Sir Thomas Beecham for performances of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in December 1918, Bach&#x27;s B minor Mass, and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Great C major&quot; Symphony in March 1919. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Samuel Langford wrote, &quot;Mr. Harty has latterly achieved far more immediate control over the orchestra, and his spirit, judgment, and control were … equally admirable.&quot;

Harty was appointed permanent conductor of the Hallé in 1920. Under his baton, the Hallé recovered the eminence it had previously enjoyed under the conductorship of its founder, Charles Hallé, and his successor, Hans Richter. Kennedy writes that under Harty it was probably the best orchestra in England. Harty&#x27;s skill as a piano accompanist developed into a similar talent for conducting concertos. Writing of his skill as in accompanying either as a pianist or as a conductor, John F. Russell wrote in 1941, &quot;Anybody who heard Harty in his capacity as accompanist could never forget his extraordinary grasp of every nuance and expressive device. There was no question of a solo with accompaniment: unless the soloist was a very great artist the chances were that he would be submerged by the artistry of the accompanist.&quot; Wilhelm Backhaus and others wished they could take the Hallé with them on their international travels. During a Brahms concerto, Artur Schnabel accidentally skipped two bars, but Harty&#x27;s rapport with and control of the Hallé was such that he kept up seamlessly with the soloist. Schnabel said afterward that he had never experienced such magnificent accompaniment, but tactlessly added that the Hallé was &quot;almost as good as the Berlin Philharmonic&quot;; Harty corrected him: the Hallé was &quot;better by two bars&quot;.

Harty introduced many new works and composers to Hallé audiences. His passion for the music of Berlioz was reflected in his programming, and he regularly performed works by contemporary composers including Bax, Moeran, Sibelius, Richard Strauss and Walton. Kennedy numbers among the outstanding occasions of Harty&#x27;s conductorship the English premieres of Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony (1930) and Shostakovich&#x27;s First Symphony (1932), the Halle&#x27;s first performances of Mahler&#x27;s Fourth Symphony (1927) and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; (1930); and the first public performance of Constant Lambert&#x27;s &quot;The Rio Grande&quot; (1929), with Harty as pianist and the composer conducting. As a composer, Harty&#x27;s best-known works from this period are his lavish reorchestrations of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot; and &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;. Harty was knighted in 1925. In 1926 he commissioned a symphony from Moeran, whose Symphony in G minor (1937) was the result, but Harty was too ill to conduct the premiere.

===Last years===
In 1932 Harty accepted the post of artistic adviser and conductor in chief of the London Symphony Orchestra. The committee of the Hallé felt that this appointment was &quot;not compatible with the whole-hearted devotion to the interests of the Hallé Orchestra&quot;, and it decided not to renew Harty&#x27;s contract when it ended in 1933.

In 1933, he was conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws by Queens University Belfast.

The Hallé committee made its decision public in a way that Harty found distressing. He had his revenge by encouraging his new orchestra to poach eight of the Hallé&#x27;s leading players to replenish the LSO&#x27;s ranks, which had recently been depleted by defections to Beecham&#x27;s new London Philharmonic Orchestra. In London, however, Harty did not prove to be a box-office draw, and according to a historian of the orchestra, Richard Morrison, Harty was &quot;brutally and hurtfully&quot; dropped in 1934, as an LSO predecessor, Sir Edward Elgar, had been in 1911.

In the spring of 1934, Harty sailed for Australia. A fellow passenger on the ocean voyage was a young woman, Lorie Bolland, with whom Harty rapidly fell in love, though there is no evidence of reciprocity on her part. Harty dedicated two piano pieces to her: &quot;Spring Fancy&quot;, composed for her birthday on 23 April 1934, and &quot;Portrait&quot;, written at sea and dated 9 July 1934. These pieces commemorate an episode in the composer&#x27;s life which had remained private until their rediscovery among Bolland&#x27;s papers in 2010.

In 1935, Harty seems to have still been well, taking part in five concerts at the British Musicians&#x27; Pension Society convalescent home in Holmwood, possibly as conductor or pianist, his role being unrecorded. In 1936 his health began to deteriorate: he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. It was operable, but his right eye had to be removed with the growth. During 1937 and 1938 Harty convalesced in Ireland and Jamaica, using the time to resume composition. He set five Irish songs and wrote his last original composition, the tone poem &quot;The Children of Lir&quot;. He returned to conducting in May 1938 at the Morecambe Music Festival and in December 1938, he conducted a studio concert with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He appeared at a London concert for the first time since the operation, in March 1939, conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the premiere of &quot;The Children of Lir&quot;. He conducted extensively during the 1939–40 season, but his health declined once more with a recurrence of the cancer, and his last public appearance was in December 1940.

Harty and his wife had become estranged, and he was nursed through his final illness by his secretary and intimate friend, Olive Elfreda Baguley. He died in Hove at the age of 61. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the grounds of Hillsborough parish church.

==Recordings==
According to the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, &quot;Recordings capture the brilliance of [Harty&#x27;s] conducting. They include &quot;The Rio Grande&quot;, Walton&#x27;s First Symphony, some outstanding Berlioz extracts and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; and Cello Concerto (with W.H. Squire).&quot; Harty was the conductor of a well-known 1929 recording of &quot;Nymphs and Shepherds&quot; with the Manchester Children&#x27;s Choir. It was a frequent radio request for many years, and was awarded a gold disc by EMI in 1989. Though few of Harty&#x27;s compositions continue to be regularly programmed in the concert hall and even the once-popular Handel arrangements have fallen from favour in the era of authentic period performance, all of the orchestral works have now been recorded, notably by the Ulster Orchestra. Hyperion released recordings of the Piano Quintet and the two String Quartets in 2012, performed by Piers Lane and the Goldner String Quartet. A CD of 25 songs (17 first recordings), performed by Kathryn Rudge and Christopher Glynn, was issued in June 2020.

<text>Mursili II (also spelled Mursilis II) was a king of the Hittite Empire (New kingdom) –1295 BC (middle chronology) or 1321–1295 BC (short chronology).

==Early Life==

Mursili was the third born son of King Suppiluliuma I, one of the most powerful men to rule over the Hittite Empire, and Queen Henti. He was the younger brother of Arnuwanda II, he also had a sister and one more brother.

==Reign==
In 1321 BC Mursili II assumed the Hittite throne after the premature death of Arnuwanda II who, like their father, fell victim to the plague which ravaged the Hittites in the 1330s BC. He was greeted with contempt by Hatti&#x27;s enemies and faced numerous rebellions early in his reign, the most serious of which were those initiated by the Kaskas in the mountains of Anatolia, but also by the Arzawa kingdom in southwest Asia Minor and the Hayasa-Azzi confederation in the Eastern Anatolia. This was because he was perceived to be an inexperienced ruler who only became king due to the early death of Arnuwanda.

=== Ten Year Annals (CTH 61) ===
Mursili records the scorn of his foes in his Annals:
While Mursili was a young and inexperienced king, he was almost certainly not a child when he took the Hittite throne and must have reached an age to be capable of ruling in his own right. Had he been a child, other arrangements would have been made to secure the stability of the Empire; Mursili after all had two surviving elder brothers who served as the viceroys of Carchemish (i.e.: Sarri-Kush) and Aleppo respectively.

Mursili II would prove to be more than a match for his successful father, in his military deeds and diplomacy. The Annals for the first ten years of his reign have survived and record that he carried out punitive campaigns against the Kaska tribes in the first two years of his reign in order to secure his kingdom&#x27;s northern borders. The king then turned to the West to resist the aggression of Uhhaziti, king of Arzawa, who was attempting to lure away Hittite allies into his camp. During his ninth year his cupbearer Nuvanza decisively defeated Hayasan forces at the Battle of Ganuvara, after which the Hayasa-Azzi would be reduced to Hittite vassals. The Annals also reveal that an &quot;omen of the sun,&quot; or solar eclipse, occurred in his tenth year as king, just as he was about to launch his campaign against the Hayasa-Azzi.

=== The eclipse ===

Mursili&#x27;s Year 10 solar eclipse is of great importance for the dating of the Hittite Empire within the chronology of the Ancient Near East. There are only two possible dates for the eclipse: 24 June 1312 BC or 13 April 1308 BC. The earlier date is accepted by Hittitologists such as Trevor R. Bryce (1998), while Paul Åström (1993) has suggested the later date. However, most scholars accept the 1312 BC event because this eclipse&#x27;s effects would have been particularly dramatic with a near total eclipse over the Peloponnese region and Anatolia (where Mursili II was campaigning) around noon. In contrast, the 1308 BC astronomical event began in Arabia and then travelled eastwards in a northeasterly direction; it only reached its maximum impact over Mongolia and Central Asia. It occurred over Anatolia around 8:20 in the morning making it less noticeable.

=== Reign length ===
Mursili II&#x27;s highest confirmed date was his twenty-second year. He is believed to have lived beyond this date for a few more years and died after a reign of around 25 to 27 years. He was succeeded by his son Muwatalli II.

==Family Tree==
Mursili is known to have had several children with his first wife Gassulawiya including three sons named Muwatalli, Hattusili III and Halpasulupi. A daughter named Massanauzzi (referred to as Matanaza in correspondence with the Egyptian king Ramesses II) was married to Masturi, a ruler of a vassal state. Mursili had further sons with a second wife named Tanuhepa. The names of the sons of this second wife have not been recorded however.

Through his son Muwatalli he had a grandson who also ruled the kingdom, Mursili III, Queen Maathorneferure and Tudhaliya IV were also grandchildren of Mursili II.

* Janet Morris wrote a detailed biographical novel, &quot;I, the Sun&quot;, whose subject was Suppiluliuma I. Mursili II is an important figure in this novel, in which all characters are from the historical record, which Dr. Jerry Pournelle called &quot;a masterpiece of historical fiction&quot; and about which O.M. Gurney, Hittite scholar and author of &quot;The Hittites&quot;, commented that &quot;the author is familiar with every aspect of Hittite culture&quot;. Morris&#x27; book was republished by The Perseid Press in April 2013.
* Chie Shinohara wrote the manga series &quot;Red River&quot; (also known as &quot;Anatolia Story&quot;), about a fifteen-year-old Japanese girl named Yuri Suzuki, who is magically transported to Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia. She was summoned by Queen Nakia who means to use Yuri as a human sacrifice. Yuri&#x27;s blood is the key element needed in placing a curse upon the princes of the land so that they will perish, leaving Nakia&#x27;s son Juda as the sole heir to the throne. As the story progresses, however, Yuri not only repeatedly manages to escape Nakia&#x27;s scheming, she also becomes revered as an incarnation of the goddess Ishtar and falls in love with prince Kail. Mursili II is portrayed as Prince Kail Mursili. In the end, Yuri decides to stay in the past, and after Juda renounces his claim out of disgust towards his mother, Kail and Yuri ascend as the rulers of Hattusa. 
* Mursili II is a major figure in all three books of the &quot;Amarna Trilogy&quot; by Grea Alexander. In the series, Mursili becomes obsessed with appeasing the gods and regaining their favor after his father&#x27;s betrayal of the Telepenus&#x27;s Proclamation and the disasters that befall the Hittites following the so-called Zannanza affair.
* Mursili II is an important presence in Gordon Doherty&#x27;s novel, &quot;Empires of Bronze: Son of Ishtar&quot; (2019), whose protagonist is Mursili&#x27;s third son, Hattusilis III.

<doc id="1070884" wikidata="Q342524" url="?curid=1070884" title="Arnuwanda II">
<text>Arnuwanda II was a Hittite great king who reigned in the late 14th century BC, perhaps in c. 1322–1321 BC. His reign was a briefly interlude between those of his father Šuppiluliuma I and younger brother Muršili II.

==Early Life==
Arnuwanda was the eldest surviving son of the Hittite great king Šuppiluliuma I and his first wife, Ḫenti, herself apparently the daughter of Tudḫaliya III (sometimes called Tudḫaliya II) and granddaughter of Arnuwanda I.

=== Crown Prince ===
Arnuwanda was declared his father&#x27;s heir apparent (&quot;tuḫkanti&quot;) and is attested as such in references to several events taking place during Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s reign. Arnuwanda&#x27;s absence from the record in the earliest events of his father&#x27;s reign suggests he was too young to participate in them at the time. Together with his father, mother, and uncle Zida, Arnuwanda was mentioned in the description of the formal installation of his younger brother Telipinu as priest (and governor) of Kizzuwatna. 

=== The Great Syrian Wars ===
By the time of the Six-Year War against Tushratta of the Mittanians, Arnuwanda was ready for military command. When the Mittanians defeated a Hittite contingent in northern Syria, Šuppiluliuma dispatched against them advance forces under Arnuwanda and his uncle Zida; they chased off the enemy, allowing Šuppiluliuma to undertake the ultimately successful siege of Carchemish. Following the murder of Arnuwanda’s younger brother Zannanza en route to become king of Egypt, Šuppiluluma sent Arnuwanda to raid and pillage the Egyptian possessions in southern Syria. Arnuwanda met with success, but the large number of captives that he brought back with him carried with them plague, which would ravage Hittite society for at least two decades, according to the &quot;Plague Prayers&quot; of Arnuwanda’s brother and eventual successor Muršili II.

==Reign==
In 1322 BC, Arnuwanda II seems to have succeeded his father Šuppiluliuma I on the Hittite throne without incident, having long been the recognized heir apparent, and having been entrusted with military command in the conflicts with Mittani and Egypt. Because his stepmother, the Babylonian Tawananna (Malnigal?), was still alive when Arnuwanda became king, she continued to occupy the position of chief queen throughout his brief reign and into that of his successor. Once king, Arnuwanda was forced to attend to the Kaška threat on northern frontier, which had preoccupied Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s last years. Apparently already ill, Arnuwanda seems to have intended conferring that command to his father&#x27;s veteran general Ḫannutti, but the latter died soon after meeting with the king. Fragmentary texts suggest Arnuwanda renewed the treaties of vassalage that his father had concluded with his younger brothers, particularly Piyaššili (Šarri-Kušuḫ) of Carchemish. Like his father Šuppiluliuma and his younger brother Muršili II, Arnuwanda seems to have interceded on behalf of the exiled ruler of the Šeḫa River Land Manapa-Tarḫunta with his hosts in Karkiša; later, Muršili would restore Manapa-Tarḫunta to his throne as a vassal king, and forgive him a subsequent rebellion.

Most modern scholars assume, from the contemporary attestation of plague and the premature death of Arnuwanda, that both Šuppiluliuma and Arnuwanda contracted the disease and succumbed to it. It is uncertain whether Arnuwanda left any children, but at any rate he was succeeded by his younger brother Muršili II.

==In fiction==

* Janet Morris wrote a detailed biographical novel, &quot;I, the Sun&quot;, whose subject was Suppiluliuma I. Arnuwanda II is an important figure in this novel, in which all characters are from the historical record, which Dr. Jerry Pournelle called &quot;a masterpiece of historical fiction&quot; and about which O.M.

Morris&#x27; book was republished by The Perseid Press in April 2013.
* He is also a character in Chie Shinohara&#x27;s historical manga &quot;Red River&quot; or Anatolia Story. In this manga he is a frail-bodied man who appoints Yuri&#x27;s boyfriend, his half-brother Mursili, as his successor. He is later murdered in very shady circumstances, and Yuri is falsely accused of killing him but her maid Ursula claims that she&#x27;s the true murderer and is executed. The culprit isn&#x27;t found until much later.
* Arnuwanda II also appears in the Historical novel, &quot;Amarna Book I: Book of Ida&quot; by Grea Alexander. In it, he is pitted against his brother, Mursili II, who is protecting Queen Ankhesenamun&#x27;s emissary, Idaten, following the murder of their brother Prince Zannanza. This book was published by SeaMonkey Ink, LLC in 2012 and is the first of a three part trilogy.

<doc id="1070887" wikidata="Q919173" url="?curid=1070887" title="Big Jim Colosimo">
<text>Vincenzo Colosimo (; February 16, 1878 – May 11, 1920), known as James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Colosimo or as &quot;Diamond Jim&quot;, was an Italian-American Mafia crime boss who emigrated from Calabria, Italy, in 1895 and built a criminal empire in Chicago based on prostitution, gambling and racketeering. He gained power through petty crime and heading a chain of brothels. From 1902 until his death in 1920, he led a gang known after his death as the Chicago Outfit. Colosimo was assassinated on May 11, 1920, and no one was ever charged with his murder. Johnny Torrio, an enforcer whom Colosimo imported in 1909 from New York, seized control of Colosimo&#x27;s businesses after his death. Al Capone, a close associate of Torrio, has been accused of involvement in Colosimo&#x27;s murder but was not yet in Chicago at the time.

==Early years==
Colosimo was born on February 16, 1878, to Luigi Colosimo and his second wife Giuseppina Mascaro in the town of Colosimi, Province of Cosenza, Italy. He emigrated from Italy to Chicago at the age of 17, starting out as a petty criminal. Colosimo attracted the attention of First Ward aldermen Michael &quot;Hinky Dink&quot; Kenna and John Coughlin. They made him a precinct captain and later their bagman. This gave Colosimo the political connections that helped him rise to power as a mob boss.

==Prostitution empire==
Later, Colosimo acquired another nickname, &quot;Diamond Jim,&quot; because he frequently dressed in a white suit and wore diamond pins, rings, and other jewelry. This, combined with his charm and money, helped him establish relationships with women. He loved women and money, which fueled his enthusiasm for prostitution. In 1902, Colosimo married Victoria Moresco, an established Chicago madam and together they began expanding their prostitution business.
Among Colosimo&#x27;s first brothels was The Victoria (named after his wife), on Archer and Armour Avenue, and The Saratoga, at Dearborn and 22nd Street. Within a few years, Colosimo had expanded this to nearly 200 brothels and had also made inroads into gambling and racketeering. Colosimo was reputedly making $50,000 ($720,000 in 2022) per month from his various legal and illegal operations.

==Help from New York and expansion==
By 1909, Black Hand extortion was a serious threat to Colosimo in Chicago. He brought in gangster John &quot;The Fox&quot; Torrio from Brooklyn and made him his second in command. Torrio was the nephew of Moresco. Laurence Bergreen states, &quot;Torrio is [also] described as Colosimo&#x27;s nephew, but in the absence of any evidence to confirm the relationship, it is more likely their kinship was spiritual rather than familial.&quot; There are also references to Colosimo&#x27;s wife being somehow related to John Torrio. 

In 1910, Colosimo opened Colosimo&#x27;s Cafe, a restaurant and nightclub at 2126 South Wabash. It quickly became a popular destination for prominent Chicagoans and visitors, gaining nationwide fame. Colosimo&#x27;s crew grew into a multi-ethnic, hierarchical gang, with Italian, Irish, Polish, and Jewish gangsters. Colosimo&#x27;s vice interests eventually expanded into Chicago&#x27;s suburbs, including Burnham and South Chicago.

In 1919, Torrio and Colosimo opened a brothel at 2222 South Wabash called the Four Deuces, referencing the address. Torrio hired his old Brooklyn colleague Al Capone to work as a bartender and bouncer, which gave Capone his entry into Chicago crime.

==Betrayal==

When Prohibition went into effect in 1920, Torrio pushed for the gang to enter into bootlegging, but Colosimo stubbornly refused. In March 1920, Colosimo secured an uncontested divorce from Moresco. A month later, he and Dale Winter eloped to West Baden Springs, Indiana. Upon their return, he bought a home on the South Side. On May 11, 1920, Colosimo drove to Colosimo&#x27;s Cafe to meet an associate he had never met before. He was shot and killed a few minutes after entering the restaurant by a gunman hiding in the cloak room. A bullet entered Colosimo&#x27;s brain, behind his right ear. Contract killer Frankie Yale had allegedly traveled from New York to Chicago and personally killed longtime gang boss Colosimo at the behest of Torrio. Although suspected by Chicago police, Yale was never officially charged. Colosimo was allegedly murdered because he stood in the way of his gang making bootlegging profits, having &quot;gone soft&quot; after his marriage with Winter. 

Colosimo was the first gang leader to organize the disparate parts of Chicago&#x27;s crime scene. After his death, Torrio took over his gang, later to be replaced by Al Capone. His mob eventually became the infamous Chicago Outfit that ruled over some parts of the city.

Colosimo was interred at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, in a lavish funeral witnessed by 5,000 mourners.

==In popular media==
===Film===
*In &quot;Scarface: The Shame of a Nation&quot; (1932), the death of &quot;Big Louie&quot; Costillo (Harry J. Vejar) is loosely based on Colosimo&#x27;s assassination. Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Camonte kills Big Louie at the behest of his friend Johnny Lovo, Costillo&#x27;s right-hand man. Lovo was based on Johnny Torrio and Camonte on Al Capone, and the film presents Costillo&#x27;s murder as the beginning of Lovo and Camonte&#x27;s involvement in bootlegging, similar to how Colosimo&#x27;s refusal to allow bootlegging is considered the primary reason for his murder.
* Joe De Santis played Colosimo in &quot;Al Capone&quot; (1959).
* Frank Campanella played Colosimo in &quot;Capone&quot; (1975).

===Television===
*Peter Siragusa portrayed Colosimo in the pilot episode of The Untouchables (1993).
*Colosimo and a fictionalized account of his murder was the subject of a 1993 episode of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, titled &quot;Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues.&quot; Colosimo was portrayed by Raymond Serra, Victoria Moresco by Linda Lutz, and Dale Winter by Jane Krakowski.
*Colosimo was portrayed by Peter Banks in a 1994 episode of In Suspicious Circumstances, titled &quot;No Witness, No Case&quot; (a reference to a prostitute whom Colosimo had sent from Chicago to Connecticut, who was murdered after she talked to the police).
*In 2010, Colosimo&#x27;s murder was depicted in the series premiere of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;. It depicts Colosimo, played by Frank Crudele, as the victim of a hit ordered by Torrio and committed by Frankie Yale to allow Torrio to go into bootlegging. He is shown being shot at the back of the head while listening to an Enrico Caruso record in his restaurant.
* He was portrayed by Andre King in the 2016 docuseries &quot;The Making of the Mob: Chicago.&quot;

===Music===
*In Ian Hunter&#x27;s song &quot;Resurrection Mary&quot;, the storyteller, who sees the infamous ghost of the title, used to do &quot;the numbers for Big Jim.&quot;

===Gaming===
*In &quot;&quot; (2020), the mentioned offscreen murder of the Illinois mob boss Felice Peppone in 1922, by his two capos Ennio Salieri and Marcu Morello to get into the bootlegging business and form their own Mafia families in the city of Lost Heaven, is loosely inspired by the murder of Colosimo.

<doc id="1070897" wikidata="Q579727" url="?curid=1070897" title="Ḫattušili II">
<text>Ḫattušili II (Hittite: &quot;[man] from Hattusa&quot;) was a possible Hittite great king during the 15th or 14th century BC, perhaps reigning c. 1440–c. 1425 BC.

==Evidence==
The existence of a king named Ḫattušili in this period of Hittite history is disputed among scholars, and considered unlikely by many. Identification of such a king relies primarily on the historical introduction to the treaty between the Hittite great king Muršili II and his nephew Talmi-Šarruma, the king of Aleppo. Following references to the Hittite kings Ḫattušili I defeating, and Muršili I and Tudḫaliya destroying Aleppo, and preceding a reference to the intervention of the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I, the relevant passage reads:
: The king of Aleppo committed an offense [against] the king of Ḫanigalbat, but he also committed an offense against Ḫattušili, [King] of Ḫatti.
: The people of Aštata and the people of Nuḫašši requested [cities] and border districts of the land of Aleppo [from] the king of Mittanni.
: And the king of Mittanni [came] and gave [these] cities and border districts [to the people] of Aštata and the people of Nuḫašši [as] a benefaction for the sake of friendly relations.
: And he wrote tablets for them &lt;concerning&gt; [these] cities and concerning these border districts, and he sealed them with his seal. The people of Aleppo thus committed an offense against Ḫattušili, [King] of Ḫatti.
: [When the people of Aštata] and [the people of] Nuḫašši [came] to Ḫattušili, King of Ḫatti, they requested the cities [and] the border districts of the land of Aleppo, [and the king of Ḫatti] came, and he gave the cities and the border districts of the land of Aleppo [… to the people of Aštata] and the people of Nuḫašši as a benefaction. [He wrote tablets concerning these cities and border districts] and he sealed them [with] his seal. They still have them in their possession.

Additionally, Onofrio Carruba and Jacques Freu consider a Middle Hittite text fragment (KUB XXXVI 109), to be attributable to this Ḫattušili with certainty and believe it to relate the appointment of Ḫattušili as heir apparent (&quot;tuḫkanti&quot;). It reads, in part:
: Now see: [Ḫattušili], who among the king’s sons was called to the kingship, may his brothers, his sisters, his [kinsmen], and all the population of Ḫattuša recognize him and, as king, show him respect. And if anyone among his brothers or sisters does not show him respect, let him veil his head from Ḫattušili. May he who is his enemy be banished!

==Interpretation==
Michael Astour, who devised an extreme compression of the generations of Hittite monarchs, dismissed Ḫattušili II as &quot;the most phantomatic&quot; &quot;of all the dubious Hittite kings.&quot; Astour provides a useful overview of the various attempts at placing Ḫattušili II within the chronological and genealogical sequence of Hittite kings up to 1989, concluding that he &quot;is an extraordinarily elusive character&quot; and should be discarded. While many of Astour’s conclusions are not accepted, this, and his identification of Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II as a single king, have remained very influential in historiography.

Reading the historical introduction to the treaty between Muršili II and Talmi-Šarruma at face value, it would confirm the existence of a Ḫattušili II, reigning sometime between Tudḫaliya I and Šuppiluliuma I. However, it has been argued that the reference to the interactions between this Ḫattušili and Aleppo in the text is in a non-chronological position, and functions as a flashback to Ḫattušili I, who defeated Aleppo in the early 16th century BC. The demonstration that there are references to Ḫanigalbat, Aštata, and Nuḫḫaši sufficiently early to allow the geopolitical context described in the treaty to date to the time of Ḫattušili I, is offset by the apparent natural flow of the narrative and the incompatibility between the roles of the ostensibly two Ḫattušilis in it.

Possibly extraneous concerns have also influenced the acceptance or rejection of Ḫattušili II: his least problematic placement separates Tudḫaliya I from Tudḫaliya II, whom many scholars identify with each other, or, assuming a single Tudḫaliya I/II, it is difficult to find place for a Ḫattušili II after him, given the apparently immediate and uninterrupted succession of subsequent kings. The placement of Ḫattušili II, if he existed, has also been bedeviled by the debate of whether he should be identified as a great-grandfather (father of Šuppiluliuma I) or more distant ancestor in the genealogy of Ḫattušili III, or not at all. Astour cited the discovery of seal impressions naming Šuppiluliuma I as the son of Tudḫaliya III as final proof of the non-existence of Ḫattušili II, but this would only preclude the insertion of Ḫattušili II at this specific point in the chronological and genealogical sequence of monarchs. Moreover, recent studies indicate that Šuppiluliuma was actually the son-in-law and perhaps adopted son of Tudḫaliya III, although that does not necessarily have any bearing on the existence and placement of Ḫattušili II.

The seeming absence of Ḫattušili II from the surviving lists of offerings to Hittite royals, has been addressed by Carruba and Freu, who not only note the jumbled and non-comprehensive nature of the lists, but also the possibility that Ḫattušili II might appear in them under a Hurrian name, PU-Šarruma, as the son of a Tudḫaliya. The Middle Hittite character of the text apparently relating the appointment of a Ḫattušili as heir to the throne, is likewise considered suggestive for the existence of Ḫattušili II.

==Possible reign==
Assuming and defending the existence of Ḫattušili II, Freu places him as the son of Tudḫaliya I and father of Tudḫaliya II. Given the scarcity of evidence and the reference to Tudḫaliya II succeeding to his father’s throne at an early age, Freu posits a short reign, which he defines approximately as 1440–1425 BC. This reign corresponded to a recession in the Egyptian involvement in northern Syria, allowing for Ḫattušili II’s intervention in the affairs of Aleppo, Aštata, and Nuḫḫaši, and possibly amicable relations with Egypt.

In terms of family relations, Freu suggests that Ḫattušili II was the son of Tudḫaliya I by possibly Kattešḫapi, the husband of a queen named Ašmu-Ḫeba, and the father of Tudḫaliya II and his sister Ziplantawiya.

<text>The Mitsubishi Ki-46 was a twin-engine reconnaissance aircraft that was used by the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. Its Army &quot;Shiki&quot; designation was Type 100 Command Reconnaissance Aircraft (); the Allied brevity code name was &quot;Dinah&quot;.

==Development and design==
On 12 December 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force issued a specification to Mitsubishi for a long-range strategic reconnaissance aircraft to replace the Mitsubishi Ki-15. The specification demanded an endurance of six hours and sufficient speed to evade interception by any fighter in existence or development, but otherwise did not constrain the design by a team led by Tomio Kubo and Jojo Hattori.

The resulting design was a twin-engined, low-winged monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage. It had a small diameter oval fuselage which accommodated a crew of two, with the pilot and observer situated in individual cockpits separated by a large fuel tank. Further fuel tanks were situated in the thin wings both inboard and outboard of the engines, giving a total fuel capacity of 1,490 L (328 imperial gallons). The engines, two Mitsubishi Ha-26s, were housed in close fitting cowlings developed by the Aeronautical Research Institute of the Tokyo Imperial University to reduce drag and improve pilot view.
The first prototype aircraft, with the designation Ki-46, flew in November 1939 from the Mitsubishi factory at Kakamigahara, Gifu, north of Nagoya. Tests showed that the Ki-46 was underpowered, and slower than required, only reaching rather than the specified . Otherwise, the aircraft tests were successful. As the type was still faster than the Army&#x27;s latest fighter, the Nakajima Ki-43, as well as the Navy&#x27;s new A6M2, an initial production batch was ordered as the Army Type 100 Command Reconnaissance Plane Model 1 (Ki-41-I).

To solve the performance problems, Mitsubishi fitted Ha-102 engines, which were Ha-26s fitted with a two-speed supercharger, while increasing fuel capacity and reducing empty weight. This version, designated Ki-46-II, first flew in March 1941. It met the speed requirements of the original specification, and was ordered into full-scale production, with deliveries starting in July.

Although at first the Ki-46 proved almost immune from interception, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force realised that improved Allied fighters such as the Supermarine Spitfire and P-38 Lightning could challenge this superiority, and in July 1942, it instructed Mitsubishi to produce a further improved version, the Ki-46-III. This had more powerful, fuel-injected Mitsubishi Ha-112 engines, and a redesigned nose, with a fuel tank ahead of the pilot and a new canopy, smoothly faired from the extreme nose of the aircraft, eliminating the &quot;step&quot; of the earlier versions. The single defensive machine gun of the earlier aircraft was omitted not long into the production run. The new version first flew in December 1942, demonstrating significantly higher speed at . The performance of the Ki-46-III even proved superior to that of the aircraft intended to replace it (the Tachikawa Ki-70), which as a result did not enter production. During operational testing in March 1944, it was discovered that replacing the engines&#x27; single exhaust collector ring with individual pipes provided extra thrust and an increase in top speed to .

In an attempt to yet further improve the altitude performance of the Ki-46, two prototypes were fitted with exhaust driven turbosupercharged Ha-112-II-&quot;Ru&quot; engines. This version first flew in February 1944, but only two prototypes were built.

Mitsubishi factories made a total of 1,742 examples of all versions (34 x Ki-46-I, 1093 x Ki-46-II, 613 x Ki-46-III, 4 x Ki-46-IV) from 1941 to 1944.

==Operational history==

This aircraft was first used by the Japanese Army in Manchukuo and China, where seven units were equipped with it, and also at times by the Japanese Imperial Navy in certain reconnaissance missions over the northern coasts of Australia and New Guinea.

The Japanese Army used this aircraft for the same type of missions, which were not authorized, over present-day Malaysia during the months before the Pacific War. Later, it was used for high altitude reconnaissance over Burma, Indochina, Thailand, and the Indian Ocean. The Ki-46 was regarded by the British RAF in Burma as a difficult aircraft to counter, only occasionally intercepting them successfully. On September 25, 1944, Flying Officer Wittridge shot down a Ki-46, using a personally modified Spitfire Mk VIII. Wittridge had removed two machine guns and the seat armour and also polished the wing leading edges to gain extra speed. The leading American fighter pilot Richard Bong, flying a P-38 Lightning, managed to shoot down a Ki-46 over the coast of Papua New Guinea in late 1942.
In 1944–45, during the last days of the war, it was modified as a high-altitude interceptor, with two 20 mm cannons in the nose and one 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon in an &quot;upwards-and-forwards&quot; position , almost like the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; night fighter cannon emplacements, for fighting USAAF B-29 Superfortresses over the metropolitan Japanese islands. It lacked stability for sustained shooting of the 37 mm (1.46 in) weapon, had only a thin layer of armour plating, lacked self-sealing fuel tanks, and was slow to climb.

The Ki-46 was also assigned to two whole &quot;Sentai&quot; (wings/groups), as well as individual &quot;Chutaicho&quot; (junior operational commanders) in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, during the Pacific War.

The Allies captured some examples during the conflict, which were then repaired and flown for evaluation purposes. The Ki-46 III was the only Japanese aircraft type sent to the NII VVS Soviet Air Force Test Institute for evaluation during 1946–7.

==Operators==
*French Air Force – Captured aircraft.
*Imperial Japanese Army Air Force
*Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service
*Chinese Communist Air Force Two captured Ki-46s in communist Chinese hands served as a ground-attack aircraft and a trainer respectively, and the last Ki-46 retired in the early 1950s.

==Surviving aircraft==

The only complete survivor is a Ki-46-III Army Type 100 example, that is part of the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum in the United Kingdom. Built around 1943, it was part of the 81st Sentai, 3rd Chutai IJAAF. This unit had detachments deployed across the South West Pacific. 

In late 1945, Japanese Surrendered Personnel at Kuruan Airfield in British Malaya were ordered to restore two Ki-46&#x27;s at the base to airworthy condition for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit. They managed this with one aircraft, and it was flown to Seletar, Singapore by a Japanese pilot in early 1946. It made a number of flights with Japanese pilots and was selected for museum preservation. It was shipped to the United Kingdom in mid-1946.

It became part of the RAF St Athan collection of historic aircraft, before moving to the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in 1989.
Ownership was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the RAF Museum in 1998 and the aircraft remained on display at Cosford until 2022, when it was moved to the RAF Museum Hendon.

Wreckage of a Ki-46-II, abandoned at Jacquinot Bay Airfield, was recovered in 2003.

<doc id="1070899" wikidata="Q282427" url="?curid=1070899" title="Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians">
<text>The Ashkali (), otherwise known as Hashkali () and/or Balkan Egyptians (; ; ), are Albanian-speaking Muslim ethnic cultural minorities (recognized communities), which mainly inhabit Kosovo and southern Serbia, as well as Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. Prior to the Kosovo War of 1999, the Balkan Egyptians or Ashkali people registered themselves as Albanians. While some Ashkali speak Romani, Egyptians usually do not. The two groups are not clearly delineated. Though they differ linguistically and culturally from the Roma, they have often been grouped together under the acronym RAE (Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptians).

==History of the Balkan Egyptians==
The origins of the Balkan Egyptians are obscure, but some Balkan historians trace the origin of Balkan Egyptians to the Iron Age, citing vague references in Herodotus of the presence of Khener, an Ancient Egyptian dance group in the region. They also attribute archaeological structures in the area, notably in modern Ohrid and Bitola, as temples of the Goddess Isis, but the Mysteries of Isis was widespread in the Greco-Roman world. It is also possible that the Balkan Egyptians can be traced back to the Doms in Egypt; other versions are that after the Ottoman–Egyptian invasion of Mani, Egyptian soldiers went to Albania. However, historians maintain that during the Ottoman era the Balkan Egyptians and other Balkan Roma were part of a single community that was called by the Ottomans &quot;Kıbti&quot; (literally &#x27;Copts&#x27;), reflecting the same group encompassed by the English ethnonym for the Roma (&quot;Gypsies&quot;). They see the alternate origins as part of a larger phenomenon whereby groups such as the Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians, as part of an effort to achieve greater civil emancipation and to escape anti-Roma prejudice, made an effort to separate themselves from other Roma and constructed a novel history for their peoples.

A 14th-century reference to a placename (Агѹповы клѣти, &quot;Agupovy klěti&quot;) in the Rila Charter of Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria was thought by some authors, such as Konstantin Josef Jireček, to be related to the Balkan Egyptians, possible descendants of the Doms in Egypt.

In 1990, an Egyptian association was formed in Ohrid, from which sprung the Egyptian Liberal Party of North Macedonia, which was attended by representatives from different Balkan countries. 

==History of Ashkali==
The origin of the Ashkali remains scientifically unexplained. The Ashkali community leaders have constructed a few narratives. According to the Persian narrative, the Ashkali people originated in Persia in the 4th century. According to the Italian narrative, which is based on folk etymology, they are colonists from ancient Rome. According to the Semitic narrative, they originated in Ashkelon (now Israel).

The Ashkali were aligned with Albanians before, during and after the Kosovo war. During the war, many were sent to refugee camps with the Romani people in Kosovo. After the war ended in 1999, some of them reaffirmed their identity as Ashkali to show their pro-Albanian stance and distinguish themselves from the Arlije and Gurbeti Roma, who had been mistakenly viewed as pro-Serbian. However, viewed by the majority population as pro-Serbian Roma, they were persecuted by Albanian nationalists in the presence of NATO forces. As the majority of Kosovo Roma, many of them settled in Serbia and Montenegro. Others moved to Albania, Serbia and Macedonia and the whole of Western Europe, such as Germany and France.

The first Ashkali party (&quot;Democratic Ashkali Party of Kosovo&quot;) was formed in 2000 under Sabit Rrahmani, who supported Kosovo&#x27;s independence in the name of all Ashkali.

==Demographics==
Most Ashkali live in Kosovo, but they also reside in Serbia and Montenegro, while most Balkan Egyptians are thought to live in North Macedonia and Albania, rather than Kosovo. In the Macedonian census of 2002, 3,713 people identified as Egyptian, while in the Serbian census of 2002 (excluding Kosovo), 814 people identified as Egyptian. In the Montenegrin census, on the other hand, 225 people identified as Egyptian.

Ashkali are predominant in the central and eastern regions of Kosovo: Ferizaj, Fushë Kosova, and Lipjan. Kosovo&#x27;s Egyptian community is mostly to be found in its western part, in Gjakova, Istog, Peja, and Deçan. The Ashkali as well as the Egyptian community of Kosovo had 98% unemployment in 2009.

In Albania, however, the Balkan Egyptian community is fully integrated into Albanian society and culture, having a high educational and employment rate as well, although a good percentage of the community do not identify as Balkan Egyptian due to cultural integration and also because of negative stereotypes about people of color. Despite the fact that most Balkan Egyptians in Albania tend to have typical Mediterranean features, fair skin and light features are not uncommon.

==Culture==
In Kosovo, Roma and Ashkali do not classify one another as &quot;gadje&quot;.
Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians reject having any relation with the Roma. The Ashkali and Roma claim the Egyptians as their own; whereas the Ashkali and Egyptians dispute over each other&#x27;s background. No television or radio channels are dedicated to Kosovo&#x27;s Ashkali or Egyptian minority audiences.
Circumcision celebrations of their sons are organized by the Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians.

<doc id="1070901" wikidata="Q350827" url="?curid=1070901" title="Arnuwanda I">
<text>Arnuwanda I was a Hittite great king during the early 14th century BC, ruling in c. 1390–1380/1370 BC. 

==Origins==
Arnuwanda&#x27;s parents are unknown. Because both Arnuwanda and his wife, Queen Ašmu-Nikkal, are described on their respective seals as the children of Tudḫaliya II (sometimes called Tudḫaliya I or I/II), this was long interpreted as a marriage between siblings. This, however, was clearly forbidden by Hittite custom and law, and it is now generally agreed that while Ašmu-Nikkal was indeed the daughter of Tudḫaliya II, Arnuwanda was only his son-in-law and possibly adoptive son, as the daughter&#x27;s &quot;antiyant&quot; husband, an acceptable heir in the absence of a son.

==Association on the throne with Tudḫaliya II==
Arnuwanda I began his reign in association with his father-in-law and predecessor, Tudḫaliya II, perhaps for as many as a dozen years or so. The simultaneous attestation of both men as great king indicates an association on the throne, something unusual in Hittite and Mesopotamian practice. Arnuwanda collaborated with his father-in-law in the Hittite campaigns against Arzawa in western Anatolia. The two kings defeated Kupanta-Kurunta of Arzawa on one or two occasions, the second time rescuing their recalcitrant vassal Madduwatta, who had attacked Arzawa on his own. The Hittites, led by the general Kišnapili, subsequently saved Madduwatta again, this time from an attack by Attaršiya of Aḫḫiya. Madduwatta subsequently betrayed Kišnapili’s movements to the enemy, causing the ambushing and destruction of the Hittite forces, but somehow avoided punishment.

==Sole reign==
===Western border - the Problems with Madduwatta===
When Tudḫaliya II died and Arnuwanda I became sole king, he continued to face the problems caused by the machinations of Madduwatta. The latter undertook hostile actions in the regions of Šallapa and Pittaša and made an alliance with his erstwhile enemy Kupanta-Kurunta of Arzawa, whom he offered his daughter as wife; nevertheless, Madduwatta portrayed this as a ploy against Kupanta-Kurunta, while protesting his loyalty to Arnuwanda. Madduwatta attacked the rebellious land of Ḫapalla, ostensibly on behalf of the Hittite monarch, but followed his own interests in annexing it, and in intervening farther afield to the south, in the Lukka lands and as far as Alašiya (Cyprus). The last conquest was possibly undertaken in cooperation with another old enemy, Attaršiya of Aḫḫiya, and again elicited protest from Arnuwanda. The Hittite monarch reclaimed Ḫapalla, but further developments with Madduwatta and Kupanta-Kurunta remain unclear.

The latter’s possible successor Uḫḫa-zalma (or Ḫuḫḫa-zalma) concluded a treaty with Arnuwanda. Later, King Tarḫunt-aradu of Arzawa would expand at Hittite expense and correspond with the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III as a fellow great king.

===Northern border===
Closer to home, on the northern frontier, Arnuwanda was faced with the incursions of the Kaška, who raided and plundered numerous towns and temples, including the important sanctuary of Nerik, which had to be abandoned to the enemy. In addition to police actions and the conclusion of treaties with Kaška leaders, Arnuwanda and his wife Ašmu-Nikkal offered up formal prayers to the gods, asking for their assistance in containing the threat. Given the gravity of the situation, Arnuwanda also exacted oaths of loyalty from military commanders near the frontiers, both in the north and south. When the Hittite vassal at Paḫḫuwa, Mita, married the daughter of a declared enemy of the Hittite monarch, Ušapa, Arnuwanda convened a public assembly, condemned Mita’s actions and demanded universal support in suppressing any disloyalty at Paḫḫuwa. The surviving sources do not preserve the resolution of the issue. Within the context of the tensions with Mita of Paḫḫuwa, there is reference to Arnuwanda’s military intervention in the area of Kummaḫa (probably modern Kemah).

===Other events===
Preoccupied with issues in Anatolia, Arnuwanda does not appear to have pursued an active policy in Syria. Here, Artatama I, the king of Mittani, concluded an alliance with Thutmose IV of Egypt, sending pharaoh his daughter as wife and effectively agreeing to a division of the region between Egypt and Mittani, which would last until the victorious campaigns of Arnuwanda’s second successor, Šuppiluliuma I. For his part, Arnuwanda resettled warriors from Išmerik (perhaps Siverek in northern Mesopotamia) and their families in Hittite-held Kizzuwatna. A treaty bound the elders of Ura (at or near Silifke) on the Mediterranean coast with the Hittite monarch, ensuring his access to the sea.

==Family==
Arnuwanda I was married to Ašmu-Nikkal, the daughter of his co-ruler and predecessor Tudḫaliya II. The queen featured prominently throughout Arnuwanda’s reign and may have survived her husband. Among their several children, the future king Tudḫaliya III (sometimes called Tudḫaliya II), also known by the Hurrian name of Tašmi-Šarri, appears to have been the eldest son and was appointed his father’s designated successor (&quot;tuḫkanti&quot;). Another son, Kantuzzili, was appointed priest (and governor) of Kizzuwatna. Other sons included Ašmi-Šarruma, Mannini, Pariyawatra, and Tulpi-Teššub.

<doc id="1070903" wikidata="Q355656" url="?curid=1070903" title="Tudhaliya II">
<text>Tudḫaliya II (sometimes identified with and designated Tudḫaliya I) was a Hittite great king in the late 15th/early 14th century BC, ruling in perhaps c. 1425–c. 1390 BC. He was the father-in-law and predecessor of Arnuwanda I.

==Identity==
The numbering of Hittite kings named Tudḫaliya varies between scholars because of debate over the identity (or not) between the first two bearers of the name. A Tudḫaliya, now attested as the son of a certain Kantuzzili, succeeded Muwatalli I, after the latter was murdered by the officials Ḫimuili and Kantuzzili (not necessarily identical to Tudḫaliya’s father). The same or a distinct Tudḫaliya, the king discussed in the present article, was the father-in-law and predecessor of Arnuwanda I. Because of uncertainty, scholars are divided in the interpretation of the evidence. Many scholars envision a single Tudḫaliya (I or I/II ), while others consider two separate kings, Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II. 

The rationale for maintaining a distinction between the two is presented by Jacques Freu, who notes, inter alia, that Tudḫaliya I was the son of the non-reigning Kantuzzili, while Tudḫaliya II writes that he ascended the throne as a youth after his father’s death; similarly, Tudḫaliya II&#x27;s sister Ziplantawiya was the daughter of a king. Additionally, Freu posits that the Šunaššura Treaty between the Hittite Kingdom and Kizzuwatna reflects successive equal and unequal treaty arrangements under two different sets of kings on both sides, discerns three Tudḫaliyas as ancestors of Muršili II on his “cruciform seal,” and argues that the Tudḫaliyas who engaged in repeated military action in Syria and in western Anatolia should be distinguished from each other to avoid an overly long reign.

The treatment below tentatively follows Freu&#x27;s distinction of two 15th-century BC Hittite great kings named Tudḫaliya.

==Family==
Freu&#x27;s reconstruction identifies Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II as grandfather and grandson, with the obscure and short-lived Ḫattušili II being the intervening generation. If this is correct, Tudḫaliya II would have been the son of Ḫattušili II, possibly by Ašmu-Ḫeba, and would have succeeded his father at an early age according to his own testimony. Tudḫaliya II had a sister named Ziplantawiya, who was titled queen, perhaps to fulfill the respective functions during her brother’s youth. At a later date, Ziplantawiya was suspected of witchcraft against her brother and sister-in-law, as indicated by the description of an anti-magical ritual undertaken to protect Tudḫaliya II, his wife Nikkal-mati, and their sons. The sons appear to have predeceased their parents, but a daughter, Ašmu-Nikkal, survived. Her husband, Arnuwanda, became Tudḫaliya’s chosen heir and was possibly adopted and apparently associated on the throne by his father-in-law.

==Reign==
Perhaps already in Tudḫaliya II&#x27;s father&#x27;s reign, the western Anatolian confederacy of Arzawa had begun to encroach on Hittite control in the peninsula. Tudḫaliya II marched against Arzawa, including the Seḫa River Land, Ḫapalla, and Wallarima, defeating them and sending captives and military equipment back home. A revolt in his rear forced him to turn to Aššuwa, which was successfully subdued; among the confederates of Aššuwa are listed Wilušiya and Taruiša, the likely Hittite renditions of Greek [W]ilios (Ilion) and Troia. The successful campaigns in the west resulted in a massive dislocation of captives and goods from the defeated countries to the Hittite core territory or other areas under Hittite rule. Since these included military personnel and equipment, this allowed for a captive prince, Kukkulli, to stir up a revolt among them. Tudḫaliya was able to suppress it.

While Tudḫailya II was busy in the west, the northern parts of his kingdom had come under Kaška attacks from the north. They were defeated in a two-year campaign, allowing Tudḫaliya a year&#x27;s respite from war. Additionally, Tudḫaliya II&#x27;s successor Arnuwanda I recalled in a later text Tudḫaliya&#x27;s efforts against Mittani and Išuwa. Tudḫaliya defeated the Išuwans, some of whom sought refuge with their ally, Sauštatar of Mittani, who refused to extradite them, resulting in further Hittite military action without permanent gains. It was perhaps in this context that Tudḫaliya II concluded his unequal treaty with Šunaššura II of Kizzuwatna, recalling that country&#x27;s earlier treaty (and submission to the Hittites?) under Tudḫaliya’s grandfather. Later, perhaps during the suspected association between Tudḫaliya II and Arnuwanda I on the throne, Kizzuwatna would be annexed by the Hittite Kingdom.

Towards the end of Tudḫaliya II&#x27;s reign, he and his associate and successor Arnuwanda II returned to the western front in a victorious military campaign against Kupanta-Kurunta, the king of Arzawa. The context of this war includes the turbulent behavior of a western Anatolian prince, Madduwata, who had been &quot;saved&quot; from Attaršiya of Aḫḫiya (the names compare to Atreus and Achaeans) by Tudḫaliya II and given successive appanages in the mountainous areas of Ḫairyati and Zippašla by the Hittite monarch. Nevertheless, Madduwata broke his oaths to keep to his lands, and intervened far and wide in western Anatolia, including the Lukka Lands and even Alašiya (Cyprus). He provoked and lost a fight with the king of Arzawa, caused the ambush and death of two Hittite commanders in the Lukka Lands by betraying their plans to the enemy, and later became an ally of Arzawa. While the Hittite sources claimed success, any gains in the west proved fleeting.

If Tudḫaliya I and Tudḫaliya II are to be identified as the same individual, he would also be credited with an intervention in Syria, where the king punished the city of Aleppo for its desertion to Mittani by destroying it, according to the historical introduction to the later treaty between the Hittite great king Muršili II and his nephew, Talmi-Šarumma of Aleppo. See Tudḫaliya I.

<doc id="1070905" wikidata="Q583243" url="?curid=1070905" title="List of Hittite kings">
<text>The dating and sequence of Hittite kings is compiled by scholars from fragmentary records, supplemented by the finds in Ḫattuša and other administrative centers of cuneiform tablets and more than 3,500 seal impressions providing the names, titles, and sometimes ancestry of Hittite kings and officials. Given the nature of the source evidence, reconstructions vary among scholars, and the dating or even existence, relationships and sequence of some kings is disputed at several point within Hittite history. The list below indicates instances of such debates, with references. 

All dates in the list below should be considered approximate. Hittite Chronology is almost completely dependent on synchronisms with other ancient Near Eastern countries. Such synchronisms are few and usually open to interpretation. Muršili I is believed to have overthrown Samsu-ditāna, the last king of the Amorite dynasty of Babylon, but the dating of this event varies widely across chronological schemes based on interpretations of the records of observation of Venus during the reign of Samsu-ditāna&#x27;s predecessor. These have resulted in several chronologies for Mesopotamia. In reference to the capture of Babylon by Muršili I, these are High (1651 BC), Middle (1595 BC), Low (1531 BC), and Ultra-Low (1499 BC), with additional variants such as the lower Middle Chronology (1587 BC). The distinction between these Mesopotamian chronological models disappears in the Late Bronze Age. Egyptian chronology is also subject to variant interpretations, resulting in three leading options, High (1304 BC), Middle (1290 BC), and Low (1279 BC), for the accession of Ramesses II, the contemporary of the Hittite kings Muwatalli II and Ḫattušili III. Assuming the preferred Low Chronology for Egypt, Ramesses II fought Muwatalli II at Kadesh in 1274 BC (Year 5), concluded a peace treaty with Ḫattušili III in 1259 BC (Year 21), and married the latter&#x27;s daughter Maathorneferure in 1246 BC (Year 34).

On the Hittite side there are very few precise indicators. The &quot;Apology&quot; of Ḫattušili III indicates that his nephew and predecessor Muršili III reigned for 7 years. A text of Muršili II records an omen of the sun at the beginning of the campaign season against Azzi-Ḫayaša, in Year 9 or 10 of the reign. It is often considered to have been a solar eclipse, with current scholarly opinion divided between one on 24 June 1312 BC (which was visible from central Anatolia but seemingly late in the year, apparently adopted in the chronologies of Amélie Kuhrt and Trevor Bryce) and one on 13 April 1308 BC (which was earlier in the year but marginally visible, from eastern Anatolia, apparently adopted in the chronology of Jacques Freu).

The lists below use variations of the Mesopotamian Middle Chronology, the most generally accepted chronology of the Ancient Near East and the chronology that accords best with Hittite evidence. The variants represented below derive from three comprehensive reconstructions of the chronological sequence of rulers, by Amélie Kuhrt (1995), Trevor Bryce (2005), and Jacques Freu (2007). All regnal dates remain approximations.

<doc id="1070913" wikidata="Q6775534" url="?curid=1070913" title="Martin Gleeson (rugby league)">
<text>Martin Gleeson (born 25 May 1980) is an English rugby league coach and former professional player. He represented both Great Britain and England internationally as a . His clubs as a player include the Huddersfield Giants, St Helens, the Warrington Wolves, the Wigan Warriors, Hull F.C. and the Salford City Reds. His honours include winning the Super League in 2002 and 2010 and the Challenge Cup in 2004.

Gleeson was banned for three years (with half being suspended) in 2011 for failing a drugs test. His ban expired on 12 November 2012.

==Early life==
Gleeson was born in Wigan. Much of his early rugby development took place in Australia, where he emigrated with his family at age 10 to live in Queensland, where he played his junior rugby league for the Slacks Creek Red Lions club based in Daisy Hill, Queensland. He also played alongside the future Australian and Queensland representative Brad Meyers at Brothers St. Paul, in Brisbane. In 2005, Gleeson revealed his desire to represent Queensland in State of Origin. He returned to England aged 17 and embarked on a professional career, signing for Huddersfield Giants in 1999.

==Playing career==
===Huddersfield Giants===
After three seasons with the Giants, he left the club following its relegation from Super League in 2001 and signed for St Helens.

===St Helens===
Gleeson made his début for Great Britain against Australia in Sydney in July 2002, also participating in the test series against New Zealand at the end of the season.

At the end of his first season with St. Helens Gleeson played as a and scored a try in the 2002 Super League Grand Final victory against the Bradford Bulls. Having won Super League VI, St. Helens contested the 2003 World Club Challenge against the 2002 NRL Premiers, the Sydney Roosters, he played as a in Saints&#x27; 0-38 defeat.

An injury lay off disrupted him in 2003. Although he missed seven games between July and September, he came back at the end of the 2003&#x27;s Super League VIII to win back his place in the Great Britain squad after a fine performance for England &#x27;A&#x27; against the touring Australians.

He opened the 2004&#x27;s Super League IX for St. Helens, and won the Challenge Cup against the Wigan Warriors at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. He and teammate Sean Long were later involved in a betting scandal that saw both players fined and suspended for the last four months of the 2004 Super League IX.

Gleeson was selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played as a in the Great Britain&#x27;s4 4-4 defeat.

===Warrington Wolves===
While serving his suspension, Gleeson was signed by the Warrington Wolves for a club record fee reported in the region of £200,000, and he made his début for the Warrington Wolves in the 2005&#x27;s Super League X. He recorded a personal best scoring tally of 17 tries in 27 Super League appearances, and he was named as a in the Super League Dream Team 2005. He was also heavily involved in providing scores for his partner, the New Zealand international Henry Fa&#x27;afili.

In September 2008, he was named in the 2008 England training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and, in October 2008, he was named in the final 24-man England squad.

He was chosen for the England team to face Wales at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster prior to England&#x27;s departure for the World Cup.

In Group A&#x27;s first match against Papua New Guinea, he played as a and scored a try in England&#x27;s victory.

Gleeson signed a two-year extension until 2011 but, on 4 April 2009, he signed for local rivals, Wigan, on a 3½-year contract.

===Wigan Warriors===
Seven rounds into the 2009&#x27;s Super League XIV, with both Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors at the time drifting outside of play-off positions, Gleeson was transferred to the Wigan Warriors on a 3½-year contract, with Richie Mathers moving in the other direction. Gleeson was an integral part of Wigan Warriors&#x27; 2010&#x27;s Super League XV, scoring two tries as they won the 2010 Super League Grand Final against St. Helens at Old Trafford.

His start of 2011&#x27;s Super League XVI was against St. Helens in the first regular round. He also played in the side&#x27;s win at the Bradford Bulls but had to be taken off in the first-half because of a hamstring injury. He recovered in time for the 2011 World Club Challenge fixture against St George Illawarra Dragons, but was ineffective and again had to be withdrawn during the match because of the injury. Before the match, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that, in December 2010, Gleeson had contacted the police alleging he was the victim of blackmail but had decided to drop the charge. Amid growing speculation, the club released a statement saying that he had left his hometown club with immediate effect citing his injury, disciplinary problems and a &quot;serious distraction in his personal life&quot; as the reasons for the departure.

===Hull F.C.===
Gleeson signed for the Super League club Hull F.C. on 15 April 2011 on an 18-month contract, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2012 Super League XVII. He made a try scoring debut in the 36–18 defeat of city rivals Hull Kingston Rovers in the Good Friday derby at the KC Stadium. In June, it was announced that he was suffering a stress-related illness and he was granted leave by the club. His contract with the club was terminated in September. In December, it was announced that he had failed a drugs test on 13 May in a game against Salford in which he scored two tries. He was subsequently banned for three years (with half being suspended) from 12 June which was his final game for the club against Harlequins.

===Salford City Reds===
In November 2012, Salford City Reds announced they had signed Gleeson on a 2-year contract for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. He scored his first try for Salford in the Magic Weekend fixture against Widnes Vikings on 26 May 2013 at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester.

Gleeson announced his retirement in September 2014.

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a player, Gleeson remained at Salford in a coaching role. In 2019, he joined the coaching staff at rugby union club Wasps. In 2021, he became the attack coach for the England national rugby union team.

He returned to rugby league in 2023, briefly working as a coach at Featherstone Rovers, before joining Warrington Wolves.

==Personal life==
Martin Gleeson is the older brother of the rugby league footballer, Mark Gleeson, and the cousin of the rugby league footballer, Sean Gleeson.

<doc id="1070916" wikidata="Q1354751" url="?curid=1070916" title="Theodore Dalrymple">
<text>Anthony Malcolm Daniels (born 11 October 1949), also known by the pen name Theodore Dalrymple (), is a conservative English cultural critic, prison physician and psychiatrist. He worked in a number of Sub-Saharan African countries as well as in the East End of London. Before his retirement in 2005, he worked in City Hospital, Birmingham and Winson Green Prison in inner-city Birmingham, England.

Daniels is a contributing editor to &quot;City Journal&quot;, published by the Manhattan Institute, where he is the Dietrich Weismann Fellow. In addition to &quot;City Journal&quot;, his work has appeared in: &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;New English Review&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Axess magasin&quot;. He is the author of a number of books, including: &quot;Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass&quot; (2001), &quot;Our Culture, What&#x27;s Left of It&quot; (2005) and &quot;Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality&quot; (2010).

In his writing, Daniels frequently argues that the leftist views prevalent within Western intellectual circles minimise the responsibility of individuals for their own actions and undermine traditional mores, contributing to the formation within prosperous countries of an underclass afflicted by endemic violence, criminality, sexually transmitted diseases, welfare dependency, and drug abuse. Much of Dalrymple&#x27;s writing is based on his experience of working with criminals and the mentally ill.

In 2011, Dalrymple was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal think-tank &quot;Libera!&quot;.

==Life==
Daniels was born in Kensington, London. His father was a Communist businessman of Russian Jewish descent, while his Jewish mother was born in Germany. She came to England as a refugee from the Nazi regime. His grandfather had served as a major in the German Army during WW1.

He studied medicine at the University of Birmingham, graduating with an MB ChB degree in 1974. He became a Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1980, and qualified as a specialist in psychiatry in 1997.

His work as a physician took him to: Southern Rhodesia (now, Zimbabwe), Tanzania, South Africa and the Gilbert Islands (now, Kiribati). He returned to the United Kingdom in 1990, where he worked in London and Birmingham.

In 1991, he made an extended appearance on British television under the name Theodore Dalrymple. On 23 February, he took part in an &quot;After Dark&quot; discussion, called &quot;Prisons: No Way Out&quot;, alongside former gangster Tony Lambrianou, Greek journalist and writer Taki Theodoracopulos, and others.

In 2005, he retired early as a consultant psychiatrist. He has a house in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, and also a house in France.

Regarding his pseudonym &quot;Theodore Dalrymple&quot;, he wrote that he &quot;chose a name that sounded suitably dyspeptic, that of a gouty old man looking out of the window of his London club, port in hand, lamenting the degenerating state of the world&quot;.

He is an atheist, but has criticised anti-theism and says that &quot;To regret religion is, in fact, to regret our civilization and its monuments, its achievements, and its legacy&quot;. Raised in a non-religious Jewish home, he began doubting the existence of a God at age nine. He became an atheist in response to a moment in a school assembly.

Daniels has also used other pen names. As &quot;Edward Theberton&quot;, he has written articles for &quot;The Spectator&quot; from countries in Africa, including Mozambique. He used the name &quot;Thursday Msigwa&quot; when he wrote &quot;Filosofa&#x27;s Republic&quot;, a satire of Tanzania under Julius Nyerere. He may also have used another pen name, in addition to his &quot;bona fide&quot; name.

==Writing==
Daniels began sending unsolicited articles to &quot;The Spectator&quot; in the early 1980s; his first published work, entitled &quot;A Bit of a Myth&quot; appeared in the magazine in August 1983 under the name A.M. Daniels. Charles Moore wrote in 2004 that &quot;Theodore Dalrymple, then writing under a different pseudonym, is the only writer I have ever chosen to publish on the basis of unsolicited articles&quot;. Between 1984 and 1991 Daniels published articles in &quot;The Spectator&quot; under the pseudonym Edward Theberton.

Daniels has written extensively on culture, art, politics, education, and medicine – often drawing on his experiences as a doctor and psychiatrist in Africa and the United Kingdom. The historian Noel Malcolm has described Daniels&#x27;s written accounts of his experiences working at a prison and a public hospital in Birmingham as &quot;journalistic gold&quot;, and Moore observed that &quot;it was only when he returned to Britain that he found what he considered to be true barbarism – the cheerless, self-pitying hedonism and brutality of the dependency culture. Now he is its unmatched chronicler.&quot; Daniel Hannan wrote in 2011 that Dalrymple &quot;writes about Koestler&#x27;s essays and Ethiopian religious art and Nietzschean eternal recurrence – subjects which, in Britain, are generally reserved for the reliably Left-of-Centre figures who appear on &quot;Start the Week&quot; and &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;. It is Theodore&#x27;s misfortune to occupy a place beyond the mental co-ordinates of most commissioning editors.&quot;

&quot;Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass&quot;, a collection of essays was published in book form in 2001. The essays, which the Manhattan Institute had first begun publishing in &quot;City Journal&quot; in 1994, deal with themes such as personal responsibility, the mentality of society as a whole, and the troubles of the underclass. As part of his research for the book, Dalrymple interviewed over 10,000 people who had attempted suicide.

&quot;Our Culture, What&#x27;s Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses&quot;, published in 2005, is another collection of essays in which he contends that the middle class&#x27;s abandonment of traditional cultural and behavioural aspirations has, by example, fostered routine incivility and militant ignorance among the poor. He examines diverse themes and figures in the book including Shakespeare, Marx, Virginia Woolf, food deserts and volitional underclass malnutrition, recreational vulgarity, and the legalisation of drugs. One of the essays in the book, &quot;When Islam Breaks Down&quot;, was named one of the most important essays of 2004 by David Brooks in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2009, Dalrymple&#x27;s British publisher Monday Books published two books of his. The first, &quot;Not With a Bang But A Whimper&quot;, appeared in August 2009. It is different from the United States book of the same name, though some of the author&#x27;s essays appear in both books. In October 2009, Monday Books published &quot;Second Opinion&quot;, a further collection of Dalrymple essays, this time dealing exclusively with his work in a British hospital and prison.

With Gibson Square Dalrymple then published his most successful book &quot;Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality &quot;(2010), which analyses how sentimentality has become culturally entrenched in British society with seriously harmful effects. In 2011, he published &quot;Litter: What Remains of Our Culture&quot;, followed by &quot;The Pleasure of Thinking &quot;(2012)&quot;, Threats of Pain and Ruin &quot;(2014), and others.

Dalrymple was a judge for the 2013 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine.

In May 2023 he spoke at the National Conservatism Conference in London on the subject of &quot;Historiography and the State of the Western Mind&quot;.

He currently writes a weekly commentary column for the online &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Themes==

Daniels&#x27;s writing has some recurring themes.
* The cause of much contemporary misery in Western countries – criminality, domestic violence, drug addiction, aggressive youths, hooliganism, broken families – is the nihilistic, decadent and/or self-destructive behaviour of people who do not know how to live. Both the smoothing over of this behaviour, and the medicalisation of the problems that emerge as a corollary of this behaviour, are forms of indifference. Someone has to tell those people, patiently and with understanding for the particulars of the case, that they have to live differently.
* Poverty does not explain aggressive, criminal and self-destructive behaviour. In an African slum you will find among the very poor, living in dreadful circumstances, dignity and decency in abundance, which are painfully lacking in an average English suburb, although its inhabitants are much wealthier.
* An attitude characterised by gratefulness and having obligations towards others has been replaced – with awful consequences – by an awareness of &quot;rights&quot; and a sense of entitlement, without responsibilities. This leads to resentment as the rights become violated by parents, authorities, bureaucracies and others in general.
* One of the things that make Islam attractive to young westernised Muslim men is the opportunity it gives them to dominate women.
* Technocratic or bureaucratic solutions to the problems of mankind produce disasters in cases where the nature of man is the root cause of those problems.
* It is a myth, when going &quot;cold turkey&quot; from an opiate such as heroin, that the withdrawal symptoms are virtually unbearable; they are in fact hardly worse than flu.
* Criminality is much more often the cause of drug addiction than its consequence.
* Sentimentality, which is becoming entrenched in British society, is &quot;the progenitor, the godparent, the midwife of brutality&quot;.
* High culture and refined aesthetic tastes are worth defending, and despite the protestations of non-judgmentalists who say all expression is equal, they are superior to popular culture.
* The ideology of the Welfare State is used to diminish personal responsibility. Erosion of personal responsibility makes people dependent on institutions and favours the existence of a threatening and vulnerable underclass.
* Moral relativism can easily be a trick of an egotistical mind to silence the voice of conscience.
* Multiculturalism and cultural relativism are at odds with common sense.
* The decline of civilised behaviour – self-restraint, modesty, zeal, humility, irony, detachment – ruins social and personal life.
* The root cause of our contemporary cultural poverty is intellectual dishonesty. First, the intellectuals have destroyed the foundation of culture, and second, they refuse to acknowledge it by resorting to the caves of political correctness.

<doc id="1070917" wikidata="Q696528" url="?curid=1070917" title="Mitsubishi Ki-67">
<text>The Mitsubishi Ki-67 &quot;Hiryū&quot; (飛龍, &quot;Flying Dragon&quot;; Allied reporting name &quot;Peggy&quot;) was a twin-engine bomber produced by Mitsubishi Aircraft Company and used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service in World War II. While its original official designation was , in all of its key parameters, the Ki-67 was similar to the contemporaneous medium bombers of other countries. Japanese Navy variants included the P2M and Q2M.

==Design==
The Ki-67 was the result of a 1941 Japanese army specification for a successor to the Nakajima Ki-49 &quot;storm dragon&quot;. This new aircraft was specified to be a high-speed twin-engined heavy bomber suitable for possible conflicts with the Soviet Union over the Manchuria-Siberia border, and unlike many Japanese warplanes, was required to have good defensive armament and the ability to survive heavy battle damage. It was also required to be highly maneuverable allowing it to carry out dive-bombing attacks and escape at low level.

The Ki-67 was designed by a team led by Kyūnojō Ozawa, chief engineer at Mitsubishi, and was a mid-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage. It was fitted with self-sealing fuel tanks and armor, features common in US fighters and bombers but frequently lacking in Japanese aircraft. With these features and its two 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engines, the Ki-67 was perhaps one of the most sturdy and damage-resistant Japanese aircraft of World War II.

The Ki-67&#x27;s bomb load of 1,070 kg (2,360 lb) carried in its internal bomb bay would classify it as a medium bomber for the US. The North American B-25 Mitchell could carry up to 2,722 kg (6,000 lb), the Martin B-26 Marauder up to 1,814 kg (4,000 lb), and the Douglas A-20 Havoc up to 907 kg (2,000 lb), for example, but they rarely carried a maximum load; when they did, their range was reduced significantly. Japanese aircraft almost invariably had greater range with their rated maximum load; this gave them a strategic capability unlike that of Allied twin-engine bombers, which were considered tactical bombers. The Ki-67&#x27;s performance was remarkable compared to US medium bombers; the Ki-67 had a level-flight top speed of - against for the B-25, 462 km/h (287 mph) for the B-26, and 538 km/h (338 mph) for the A-20 -, good manoeuvrability in high-speed dives (up to 644 km/h/400 mph), excellent sustained rate of climb, and outstanding agility (excellent turn rate, small turn radius, and ability to turn at low speeds). The manoeuvrability of the Ki-67 was so good that the Japanese used the design as the basis for the Mitsubishi Ki-109 twin-engine fighter, originally designed as a night fighter, and later for use as a daylight heavy fighter. In the last stages of World War II, the Japanese Navy also used the design as the basis for the Mitsubishi Q2M1 &quot;Taiyo&quot; radar-equipped anti-submarine aircraft.

Armament of the Ki-67 included a dorsal turret with a 20 mm (.79 in) Ho-5 cannon, in addition to 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns in the tail, nose, and beam positions. Some aircraft were fitted with a 20 mm gun in the tail position, and early models used 7.7 mm (.303in) Type 89 machine guns in the beam positions.

==Operations==
The Ki-67 was used for level bombing and torpedo bombing; it could carry one torpedo attached under the fuselage. The Ki-67 was initially used by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Services against the US Third Fleet, during its strikes against Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands. It was later used at Okinawa, in Mainland China, French Indochina, Karafuto, and against B-29 airfields in Saipan and Tinian. One special ground-strike version used in the &quot;Giretsu&quot; missions was a Ki-67 I with three remote-control 20 mm cannons angled at 30° for firing toward the ground, a 20 mm cannon in the tail, 13.2 mm (.51 in) Type 3 machine guns in the lateral and upper positions, and more fuel capacity. Even with more fuel, the &quot;Giretsu&quot; missions were one-way only because of the long range. In the last stages of World War II, special attack versions of the Ki-67 (the I KAI and Sakura-dan models) were used in kamikaze missions. (References include information from Lt. Sgt. Seiji Moriyama, a crew member in &quot;Fugaku&quot; Special Attack Unit, who witnessed Ki-67&#x27;s being converted into &quot;To-Gō&quot; suicide planes with two 800 kg/1,760 lb bombs during Okinawa operations.)

By the end of World War II, 767 Ki-67s had been produced. Other sources relate that 698 Ki-67&#x27;s were manufactured, excluding the &quot;KAI&quot; and &quot;Sakura-dan&quot; conversions.

<text>The fig roll or fig bar is a biscuit or cookie consisting of a rolled cake or pastry filled with fig paste.

==History==
Figs have been a popular food since ancient times, originating in the areas of the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.

Early Egyptians may have invented the first fig roll—a simple pastry made with fig paste and a flour-based dough. In the Middle Ages, the arab physician Ibn Butlan is recorded to have recommended eating figs with biscuits, or sugared bread—an early instance of what could be considered a fig roll.

Fig rolls were popular with British immigrants in the United States in the late 19th century.

==Fig Newtons==
 
Fig Newtons are a popular mass-produced cookie similar to a fig roll. In 1892 James Henry Mitchell, a Florida engineer and inventor, received a patent for a machine that could produce a hollow tube of cookie dough and simultaneously fill it with jam. The machine consisted of two funnels, one inside the other, with the outer funnel creating the dough tube and the inner funnel filling that tube with fig jam.

At the same time, Philadelphia baker and fig lover Charles Roser was developing a recipe for a pastry based on the British homemade fig roll. Roser approached the Cambridgeport, Massachusetts–based Kennedy Biscuit Company, who agreed to take on production and sales.

Kennedy Biscuit Company had recently become associated with the New York Biscuit Company, and after merger to form Nabisco, trademarked the product as the Fig Newton. The cookie was named after the Massachusetts town of Newton. It was one of the first commercially-produced baked goods in the United States.

Since 1963, the club has played their home games at the Max-Morlock-Stadion in Nuremberg. Today&#x27;s club has sections for boxing, handball, hockey (inline skater hockey and ice hockey), rollerblading and ice skating, swimming, skiing, and tennis.

Nürnberg hold the joint record for promotions from the various second divisions to the Bundesliga at 8 with Arminia Bielefeld. Owing to its status as a founding member of the Bundesliga while Bielefeld was not, however, Nürnberg&#x27;s consequent nine relegations from the top tier are a record by itself.

==History==
===Rise of &quot;Der Club&quot;===
1. FC Nürnberg was founded on 4 May 1900 by a group of 18 young men who had gathered at local pub Burenhütte to assemble a side committed to playing football rather than rugby, one of the other new &quot;English&quot; games becoming popular at the time. By 1909, the team was playing well enough to win the South German championship. After World War I, Nürnberg would gradually turn their success into the dominance of the country&#x27;s football. In the period from July 1918 to February 1922, the team would go unbeaten in 104 official matches. As early as 1919, they came to be referred to simply as &quot;Der Club&quot; in recognition of their skill and of their style on and off the field and would go on to become one of the nation&#x27;s most widely recognized and popular teams.

Nürnberg faced SpVgg Fürth in the first national championship held after the end of World War I, beating the defending champions 2–0. That would be the first of five titles &quot;Der Club&quot; would win over the course of eight years. In each of those victories, they would shutout their opponents.

The 1922 final was contested by Nürnberg and Hamburger SV but never reached a conclusion on the pitch. The match was called on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2. The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, that game was called at 1–1 when Nürnberg was reduced to just seven players and the referee ruled incorrectly the club could not continue. The German Football Association (DFB) awarded the win to Hamburger SV under the condition that they renounce the title in the name of &quot;good sportsmanship&quot;, and ultimately the Viktoria trophy was not officially awarded that year.

===After the glory years===
1. FCN&#x27;s dominance was already beginning to fade when they captured their final trophy of the era in 1927 as the game began to evolve into a more quickly paced contest which did not suit their slower, more deliberate approach. In 1934, they lost in the final to Schalke 04, a club that would go on to become the strongest side in the era of football in Nazi Germany. Nürnberg won national titles just before and after World War II in 1936 and 1948 – in the first post-war national final – and would also take the Tschammerpokal, the forerunner of today&#x27;s DFB-Pokal, in 1935 and 1939.

===Into the modern era===
The post-war period began with the club being integrated into the Oberliga Süd, one of the five top divisions in West-Germany at the time. Nürnberg won this league six times until 1963, winning the national championship in 1948. In 1961, 1. FCN captured their eighth national title and appeared in a losing effort in the following year&#x27;s final. Some consolation was to be had in the team capturing its second DFB-Pokal in 1962. The club&#x27;s strong play made it an obvious choice to be amongst the 16 teams selected to participate in the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s new professional football league formed in 1963. &quot;Der Club&quot; played as a mid-table side through the league&#x27;s early years until putting on a dominating performance in 1968, in which it sat atop the league table from the fifth week of play on to the end of the season en route to its first Bundesliga title. It went on to become the first reigning champions to be relegated from the Bundesliga. This was a result of Max Merkel&#x27;s decision to remove his championship-winning team of veterans – believing that they were too old – in favour of a dozen newcomers.

It would take the club nine years to recover and return from the second tier (first the Regionalliga Süd, then the 2. Bundesliga Süd), that included several failed efforts in the promotion rounds. 1. FCN returned to the Bundesliga for a year in 1978, but finish 17th and were relegated again. The club immediately played its way back to the top flight, but since then its Bundesliga performances have typically ended in the lower positions in the league table with occasional relegations. The side&#x27;s best result in recent decades was a fifth-place finish in 1988.

The early 1980s also saw the rise of a longstanding and intense friendship between the fans of Nürnberg and those of former archrival Schalke 04. Fans accompany each other&#x27;s on their respective away games, and the two-season matches between the teams are generally a very laid-back and hospitable affair for all fans involved.

In the mid-1990s, Nürnberg had financial problems, including the conviction of their club treasurer Ingo Böbel for fraud and misallocating club finances. This led to their being penalized six points in the 1995–96 season while playing in the 2. Bundesliga. The club was relegated to the third division as a consequence. Gradual improvements were made in the subsequent seasons.

In 1999, however, 1. FCN suffered what was arguably the worst end-of-season collapse in Bundesliga history. Going into the last game of the campaign, the club sat in 12th place, three points and five goals ahead of Eintracht Frankfurt in 16th place. Nürnberg&#x27;s last home game against SC Freiburg, which was also facing relegation while Frankfurt was up against 1. FC Kaiserslautern, the previous season&#x27;s champions who in a fight for a UEFA Champions League spot. FCN had already begun sending renewal letters to current season ticket holders which included statements about successfully avoiding relegation. Every other team in the equation won their matches, including Frankfurt who routed Kaiserslautern 5–1 with three late goals, whereas Nürnberg lost 2–1, with Frank Baumann missing a chance to score in the last minute, and suffered a shock relegation. 1. FCN was not relegated because they had fewer points than Frankfurt, nor because of a lower goal differential, but on the third tie-breaker – fewer goals scored.

===21st century===
1. FCN rebounded and returned to the Bundesliga, but still found itself battling with relegation in most years. However, relegation was avoided comfortably in the 2005–06 season, finishing eighth in the Bundesliga. After several years of consolidation, Nürnberg seemed to be back as a strong force in German football. Manager Martin Bader&#x27;s work (such as the signing of former Ajax captain and Czech international Tomáš Galásek), as well as head coach Hans Meyer&#x27;s tactical awareness, helped Nürnberg to its most successful finish in almost 40 years. In May 2007, qualification for the UEFA Cup was assured, and after eliminating Eintracht Frankfurt in the semi-final, the &quot;Club&quot; won the DFB-Pokal final against VfB Stuttgart 3–2 after extra time, winning the trophy 45 years after its last victory.

In the first round of 2007–08 the team&#x27;s form in the Bundesliga was poor, but due to finishing second in their UEFA Cup group (ahead of eventual champion Zenit Saint Petersburg), head coach Hans Meyer was allowed to restructure the team, for example by buying Czech international striker Jan Koller from Monaco. Little improvement was seen, and Meyer was replaced by Thomas von Heesen after two fixtures in the second half of the season. Von Heesen did not do much better, and 1. FCN was relegated in 16th place after losing 2–0 at home to Schalke 04 on the final matchday. After a slow start, Michael Oenning was able to guide Nürnberg to a third-place finish and a 5–0 aggregate win over Energie Cottbus in the play-off to rejoin the Bundesliga. The club was demoted again, however, after the 2013–14 season, finishing 17th with another final matchday loss to Schalke 04. The club finished third in the 2015–16 season and qualified for the promotion play-off, but lost on aggregate to Eintracht Frankfurt to remain in the 2. Bundesliga for 2016–17. The club went on to finish 2nd in 2017–2018 season, securing a promotion spot into the Bundesliga with an away win against SV Sandhausen. However, they finished bottom of the table the next season and were relegated once more.

In the 2019–20 2. Bundesliga season, they finished in 16th place and faced a relegation play-off against 3. Liga side and fellow Bavarians Ingolstadt. The tie ended 3–3 on aggregate with Nürnberg winning on away goals; the goal which retained their second-tier status was scored in the sixth minute of injury time in the second leg, thereby keeping them up at the last moment.

==Rivals==

SpVgg Greuther Fürth is 1. FCN&#x27;s longest standing local rival. The rivalry dates back to the early days of German football when, at times, those two clubs dominated the national championship. The clubs have played 258 matches against one another, the most in German professional football. In 1921, the Germany national team consisted only of players from Nürnberg and Fürth for a match against the Netherlands in Amsterdam. The players traveled in the same train, but with the Nürnberg players in a carriage at the front of the train and those from Fürth in a carriage at the rear, while team manager Georg B. Blaschke sat in the middle. A Fürth player scored the first goal of the match but was only congratulated by Fürth players. Allegedly, Hans Sutor, a former Fürth player, was forced to leave the team when he married a woman from Nuremberg. He was later signed by 1. FC Nürnberg and was in the team that eventually won three national championships. Both clubs played together in the Bundesliga in 2012–13.

Games against Bayern Munich are usually the biggest events of the season, as the two clubs are the most successful in Bavaria and Germany overall.

==Reserve team==

The &quot;1. FC Nürnberg II&quot; (or &quot;1. FC Nürnberg Amateure&quot;) qualified for the Regionalliga Süd on the strength of a third place in the Bayernliga (IV) in 2007–08. The team had been playing in the Bayernlig since 1998, finishing runners-up three times in those years. When not playing in the Bayernlig, the team used to belong to the Landesliga Bayern-Mitte. Nowadays, it plays in tier four Regionalliga Bayern.

==Honours==
&quot;Der Club&quot; boasted the title of &quot;Deutscher Rekordmeister&quot; as holder of the most championships for over 60 years (although occasionally having to share the honour with Schalke 04) before being overtaken by Bayern Munich in 1987.

Germany honours its Bundesliga champions by allowing them to display the gold stars of the &quot;Verdiente Meistervereine&quot; – one star for three titles, two stars for five and three stars for ten. However, currently, only titles earned since 1963 in the Bundesliga are officially recognized. Despite winning the national title nine times, Nürnberg – the country&#x27;s second-most successful side – is not entitled to sport any championship stars.

==Stadium==
&quot;Der Club&quot; plays in the communally-owned Max-Morlock-Stadion. It has been the club&#x27;s home since 1963, and currently has a capacity of 50,000 spectators following the stadium&#x27;s most recent expansion during the winter break of the 2009–10 season. The club previously played its matches at the &quot;Zabo&quot; (an abbreviation of Zerzabelshof, the district in which the ground was located).

The stadium was built in 1928 and was known as Stadion der Hitler-Jugend from 1933 to 1945. then as the Frankenstadion (Franconia Stadium). Originally having a capacity of 40,000 spectators, it was expanded in 1965 to hold 65,000 and subsequently hosted the 1967 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final between Bayern Munich and Rangers, won 1–0 by the German side. The facility was refurbished for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and another renovation allowed it to seat 45,000 for four preliminary round matches and one Round of 16 contest of the 2006 World Cup.

The Frankenstadion bore the commercial name &quot;Grundig Stadion&quot; from 2012 under an arrangement with a local company. The majority of the fans were in favour of renaming it after club legend Max Morlock. Morlock&#x27;s name was finally used in 2017.

A feasibility study was commissioned by the club in the 2010s over the possibility of constructing a new stadium, with contact made with potential partners. It would be built on the same site and hold a capacity of 50,000 spectators. However, the club never announced any official plans for a new stadium and no major changes had been made by 2024, in which Nuremberg was overlooked as a host city for the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament held in Germany.

<text>Isidor &quot;Dore&quot; Gold (, born 1953) is an American-Israeli political scientist and diplomat who served as Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations from 1997 to 1999. He is currently the President of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. He was also an advisor to the former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his first term in office. In May 2015, Netanyahu named him Director-General of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until October 2016.

==Early life==
Dore Gold was born in 1953 in Hartford, Connecticut, in the United States, and was raised in a Conservative Jewish home. His primary education was spent at the Orthodox Yeshiva of Hartford. In the 1970s, Gold attended Northfield Mount Hermon School (Class of 1971) and then enrolled in Columbia University. There Gold earned BA and MA in Political Science, and then a PhD in Political Science and Middle Eastern Studies.

He studied literary Arabic and specialized in international law, and his doctoral dissertation was about Saudi Arabia. This research later formed the foundation for his 2003 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, &quot;Hatred&#x27;s Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism&quot;. In the book, Gold argues that Saudi Arabia actively funds terrorism by supporting the enemies of the U.S. and attacking its allies.

==Political career==
Dore Gold&#x27;s political career began in 1985 when Gold served as senior research associate at Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Moshe Dayan Centre for Near East Studies. Later, he was appointed Director of the U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy Project at the Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University and held this position from 1985 to 1996.

In 1991, Gold was an advisor to the Israeli delegation at the Madrid Peace Conference. From June 1996 to June 1997 he served as Foreign Policy Adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

According to Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin, Gold and Netanyahu advisor Yitzhak Molcho were the first envoys of the newly elected Likud government to meet with Yasser Arafat in the Gaza Strip on June 27, 1996. Dennis Ross relates to the &quot;Abu-Mazen-Dore Gold&quot; talks that ensued afterwards as a result of which the Palestinians closed down offices in East Jerusalem that Israel had argued were a violation of the Oslo Accords. 

Also in 1996, Gold secured a commitment from Secretary of State Warren Christopher that the Rabin &quot;deposit&quot; on the future of the Golan Heights did not bind the State of Israel. This effort also included obtaining a new US commitment from the Clinton administration to the September 1975 Ford letter, in which it was stated that the US would give great weight to Israel remaining on the Golan Heights. This renewed commitment came in a formal letter of assurances to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on September 19, 1996.

In December 2013, it was announced that Gold would once again advise Netanyahu, with his purview covering Israel&#x27;s relations with the U.S. and United Nations, as well as Iran policy.

On May 25, 2015, Netanyahu announced Gold&#x27;s appointment as Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, subject to the cabinet&#x27;s approval. On October 13, 2016, Gold resigned from the Director-General&#x27;s position for personal reasons.

===Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs===
Since 2000 Gold has served as president of the non-profit institute, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. From 2001 to 2003, Gold served as an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, most notably at the Aqaba Summit with President George W. Bush. During this period, Gold regularly appeared on US network television programs on behalf of the Sharon government, including &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Late Edition&quot;, as well as on &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;. In July 2003, Gold testified as an expert before the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s alleged role in providing ideological and financial support for international terrorism.

Since 2006, Gold led an international effort by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs to advocate that UN member states take legal measures against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran on grounds that he violated the anti-incitement clauses of the 1948 Genocide Convention, with his repeated statements about &quot;wiping Israel off the map.&quot; Gold led a delegation to a conference held jointly with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations at the New York County Bar Association on December 14, 2006. Speakers included former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler, Prof. Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, and the US ambassador to the UN John Bolton. Senator Hillary Clinton sent a letter of support to the conference.

Gold led an Israeli delegation to a second conference at the British House of Commons on January 25, 2007 which was chaired by Lord David Trimble and supported by members of the British Labour Party and the Conservative Party. Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the Israeli team. As a result of this effort, over 60 members of the House of Commons called for the indictment of Ahmadinejad. A third event organized by Gold and the International Association of Genocide Scholars was held on September 23, 2008 in Washington D.C. Speaking at the third conference was Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, former US ambassador to the UN, as well as Salih Mahmoud Osman, a member of the Sudanese Parliament and advocate for human rights in Darfur.

<doc id="1070945" wikidata="Q4603576" url="?curid=1070945" title="2004 rugby league betting scandal">
<text>2004 saw a scandal in the sport of rugby league involving Great Britain international players Sean Long and Martin Gleeson. Both players were playing for St. Helens at the time; the match in question was between Bradford Bulls and St Helens on Easter Monday, April 2004.

==History==
St Helens were scheduled to face Huddersfield Giants in the 2004 Challenge Cup Semi-Final. They had been given a demanding draw in the competition and had already knocked out top teams Bradford, Leeds Rhinos and Hull F.C. in previous rounds. In addition, the Semi-Final was to be played the weekend after the tough Easter period, in which Super League teams are required to play 3 games in a week. As a result, the St Helens squad, having already competed in three more high-intensity matches than all the other Super League teams, were struggling to cope and coach Ian Millward was worried about his players becoming fatigued and losing form heading into the semi-final. To counter this, he rested eleven first choice players for the clash with defending Super League champions Bradford, effectively playing his reserves and accepting certain defeat in that game.

Knowing that St Helens were set to field a weakened side, Long and Gleeson placed bets on Bradford to win. Gleeson bet £1,000 that Bradford would win by a margin greater than eight points, whilst Long placed a bet of similar value on the Bulls&#x27; victory.

Bradford won 54–8. Long was one of the players left out of the squad but Gleeson was selected by Millward, and indeed scored the first try.

Both players admitted their guilt and apologised for their actions. An RFL investigation chaired by a panel comprising Judge Peter Charlesworth, Deryck Fox, and David Poulter accepted that there was no evidence to suggest Gleeson had attempted to play badly to influence the result, but both players were declared guilty of breaching an RFL by law prohibiting players betting on matches in which their club was involved, regardless of whether or not they were involved in the game.

They were each fined £7,500 and ordered to pay £2,205 costs. Long was handed a three-month and Gleeson a four-month suspension. A few weeks after receiving the suspension, Gleeson signed for Warrington Wolves for a fee reported at £200,000.

<doc id="1070947" wikidata="Q7794833" url="?curid=1070947" title="Thomas Walker (explorer)">
<text>Thomas Walker (January 25, 1715 – November 9, 1794) was a physician, planter and explorer in colonial Virginia who served multiple terms in the Virginia General Assembly, and whose descendants also had political careers. Walker explored the Western Colony of Virginia (present-day Kentucky) in 1750, a full 19 years before the arrival of famed frontiersman Daniel Boone.

==Early life==
Thomas Walker was born at &quot;Rye Field&quot;, Walkerton, King and Queen County, Virginia. He was raised as an Englishman in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Walker&#x27;s first profession was that of a physician; he had attended the College of William &amp; Mary and studied under his brother-in-law Dr. George Gilmer.

Walker married Mildred Thornton (widow of Nicholas Meriwether) in 1741, and acquired land and owned enslaved people in the soon-to be formed Albemarle County from her late husband&#x27;s estate. The couple built a home known as Castle Hill and had 12 children. They in turn would later become prominent Albemarle County citizens in their own right. Two of Walker&#x27;s sons, John and Francis Walker, became U.S. Congressmen. After the death of his first wife, in 1781 Walker married Elizabeth Thornton.

==Planter and burgess==
In April 1744, Walker was elected as vestryman at his church, a position he held for more than forty years, until 1785. He also served Virginia as a delegate to the House of Burgesses many times, first from Louisa County, then newly formed Hampshire County in the Appalachian region, and finally from Albemarle County. Walker also became a trustee of the newly formed town of Charlottesville.

Around 1742, Walker brought several English Foxhounds to Keswick, which the Keswick Hunt Club describes as the beginning of fox-hunting in the region.

==Pioneer and explorer==
On July 12, 1749, the Loyal Land Company was founded with Walker as a leading member, along with fellow surveyors Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson, as well as many investors. After receiving a royal grant of in what is now southeastern Kentucky (which was occupied by Native Americans), the company appointed Walker to lead an expedition to explore and survey the region in 1750, so he set out, probably along the Wilderness Road. Walker also bought a plantation from Frye along the Hardware River in Albemarle County, in part to pay sums due him for his surveying services. Fellow stockholders elected Walker head of the Loyal Land Company in 1752.

During the expedition, Walker gave names to many topographical features, including the Cumberland Gap. His party built the first non-Indian house (a cabin) in Kentucky, and helped Virginia pioneer Samuel Stalnaker build his home on the westernmost point in colonial Virginia. Walker kept a daily journal of the trip.

During some of his expeditions, Walker explored with fellow Virginian, Indian agent, legislator, surveyor and later Revolutionary War general, Joseph Martin, as some of the first colonialists to travel in this area. Martin&#x27;s son, Revolutionary War officer Colonel William Martin, described the naming of the area and river in a letter to historian Lyman Draper,
A treaty with the Cherokees was held at Fort Chiswell on New River, then a frontier. On the return of the chiefs home, Dr. [Thomas] Walker, a gentleman of distinction, and my father, [General] Joseph Martin, accompanied them. The Indians being guides, they passed through the place now called Cumberland Gap, where they discovered a fine spring. They still had a little rum remaining, and they drank to the health of the Duke of Cumberland. This gave rise to the name of Cumberland Mountain and Cumberland River.

At age 64, Walker again traveled to the western areas of what is now Kentucky and Tennessee; he had been commissioned to survey the border between westward of the Virginia and North Carolina. (At that time each state claimed the land to the west of their boundaries for ultimate settlement by the right of discovery.) Because the border was mapped and surveyed, rather than created along the natural boundary of a river, it was considered controversial. It was called the &quot;Walker Line&quot; and still constitutes the border between Kentucky and Tennessee from east to west terminating at the Tennessee River.

Walker was influential in dealing with Indian affairs. He was appointed to represent Virginia at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and Treaty of Lochaber (1770), and dealt with the peace negotiations after the Battle of Point Pleasant. In 1775, Walker served as a Virginia commissioner in negotiations with representatives of the Iroquois Six Nations in Pittsburgh, as the colonies tried to engage them as allies against the British.

He is credited as the first to discover and use coal in Kentucky. Because of his broad knowledge of the areas and their resources, Walker became an adviser to Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783 as the future president wrote his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1785).

==Death, legacy and honors==
Thomas Walker died on November 9, 1794, at his home of Castle Hill.

Kentucky built a replica of the cabin which his expedition put up in present-day Kentucky; it has been designated as the Dr. Thomas Walker State Historic Site. Thomas Walker High School is one of two high schools in Lee County, Virginia. It is located one mile east of the town of Ewing, and three miles west of the town of Rose Hill. Thomas Walker High School was built in 1940. It was built to combine Rose Hill High School and Ewing High School. The high school was remodeled and enlarged in 1959. The last addition was added to Thomas Walker High School in 1971. The Rose Hill District is made up of two towns, Rose Hill and Ewing.

<text>Heinz Henghes (20 August 1906 – 20 December 1975) was a British sculptor.

Born Gustav Heinrich Clusmann in Hamburg (Germany). At the age of 17, Henghes ran away from home to go to the United States. In New York City he met a number of artists and writers and was influenced by Isamu Noguchi. In 1932, after eight years in America, Henghes travelled to France and lived for a short time in Paris where he met Constantin Brâncuși. In 1933 he went on to Rapallo in Italy where he enjoyed the patronage of Ezra Pound, who helped him by providing materials and space to work. For the next four years, Henghes was based in Italy, holding a number of exhibitions and building his reputation as a sculptor.

In 1937, following a further interlude in Paris, Henghes moved to England and set up his studio in London. By the time of the outbreak of war he had exhibited in various venues including the Guggenheim Jeune Gallery in Cork Street. Still a German national, Henghes was sent on the notorious ship the HMT Dunera to Australia where he was briefly interned in 1940 at Camp Hay. In 1941 he returned to England and for much of the war did freelance writing on current affairs for the BBC. His talks were broadcast on Radio Newsreel, on the Latin American Service, on the Italian Programme and other services in a variety of languages.

One man and group shows increased after the war and, whilst a lecturer in sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London, Henghes participated in the 1951 Festival of Britain. During this period he also broadcast on art and became a naturalised British citizen.

In 1953 Henghes moved to the Dordogne region of France where he was drawn by the discovery of Lascaux. In 1964 he returned to England to take up the post of Head of Fine Art at Winchester School of Art. He retired again to France in 1973. He died in Bordeaux in 1975.

Henghes is particularly noted for his finely polished white marble torsos, but he moved with the times, always living for the present, and worked in a range of materials and styles.

<doc id="1070959" wikidata="Q2341073" url="?curid=1070959" title="First Carlist War">
<text>The First Carlist War was a civil war in Spain from 1833 to 1840, the first of three Carlist Wars. It was fought between two factions over the succession to the throne and the nature of the Spanish monarchy: the conservative and devolutionist supporters of the late king&#x27;s brother, Carlos de Borbón (or &quot;Carlos V&quot;), became known as Carlists (&quot;carlistas&quot;), while the progressive and centralist supporters of the regent, Maria Christina, acting for Isabella II of Spain, were called Liberals (&quot;liberales&quot;), &quot;cristinos&quot; or &quot;isabelinos&quot;. Aside from being a war of succession about the question who the rightful successor to King Ferdinand VII of Spain was, the Carlists&#x27; goal was the return to an absolute monarchy, while the Liberals sought to defend the constitutional monarchy.

It was the largest and most deadly civil war in nineteenth-century Europe and fought by more men than the Spanish War of Independence. It might have been the largest counter-revolutionary movement in 19th-century Europe depending on the figures. Furthermore, it is considered the &quot;last great European conflict of the pre-industrial age&quot;. The conflict was responsible for the deaths of 5% of the 1833 Spanish population—with military casualties alone amounting to half this number. It was mostly fought in the Southern Basque Country, Maestrazgo, and Catalonia and characterized by endless raids and reprisals against both armies and civilians.

Importantly, it is also considered a precursor to the idea of the two Spains that would surface during the Spanish Civil War a century later.

== Background ==
Before the start of the Carlist Wars, Spain was in a deep social, economic, and political crisis as a result of mismanagement by Charles IV and Ferdinand VII, and had stagnated from the reforms and successes of Charles III of Spain.

=== Demographic ===
Spain had only slightly more than 20 inhabitants per square kilometer in the early 19th century, much less than other European countries. At the start of the Carlist War, the population was approximately 12.3 million people.

=== Loss of the colonies ===

While the Spanish American wars of independence began in 1808, more than two decades before the death of Ferdinand VII, the social, economic and political effects of the American conflicts still were of great significance in the peninsula. In fact, not until the start of the Carlist conflict did Spain abandon all plans of military reconquest. Between 1792 and 1827 the value in millions of reales of imports of goods, imports of money, and exports from the Americas had decreased by a factor of 3.80, 28.0, and 10.3 respectively.

Furthermore, various conflicts with the British and especially the Battle of Trafalgar had left the Spanish without the naval strength to maintain healthy maritime trade with the Americas and the Philippines, leading to historically low overseas revenue. Between 1792 and 1827, Spanish foreign imports decreased from 714.9 million reals to 226.2 and exports decreased from 397 million to 221.2. This economic weakness would prove crucial at restraining Spain&#x27;s ability to climb out of the woes of the next decades and leading up to the Carlist wars.

=== War of Spanish Independence and the Napoleonic Wars ===

While Spain had been an ally of Napoleon, this changed in 1808 after France occupied Spain and installed Joseph Bonaparte as King in place of the Bourbons. Although the high nobility accepted this change, the Spanish people did not and soon a bloody guerilla war erupted. This war lasted until 1814, and during those years Spain would be ravaged by the estimated deaths of over a million civilians out of the twelve that populated Spain at the time. Furthermore, French troops heavily looted the country, especially as the focus of the army shifted towards the French invasion of Russia.

=== Economic ===

In the 19th century, Spain was heavily in debt and in a dire situation economically. Various conflicts with the British and especially the Battle of Trafalgar had left the Spanish without the naval strength to maintain healthy maritime trade with the Americas and the Philippines, leading to historically low overseas revenue and ability to control the colonies. The &quot;de facto&quot; independence of many of these colonies during the Napoleonic Wars and later wars of independence further strained the royal coffers. Between 1824 and 1833 the average annual income was &quot;barely more than half&quot; the pre-wars&#x27; level. Additionally, the political instability further constrained Spain&#x27;s ability to collect taxes—the Riego revolt meant the government could only collect 12% of its projected revenue for the first half of 1820.

Spain had been heavily looted during the Napoleonic Wars and had only managed to fight as a junior partner under British leadership, financed and even clothed by British subsidies. Nonetheless, the Spanish government would be overburdened with costs needed to establish control over the country over the following decades—88% of taxes collected in February 1822 went to fund the military—which increased when Ferdinand maintained a French garrison between 1824-1828 &quot;as a Varangian Guard&quot; to ensure his power. In 1833, Spain&#x27;s forces comprised 100,000 Royalist Volunteers, 50,000 regulars, and 652 generals.

The progressives of the Trienio had managed to secure loans from British financiers, which Ferdinand then defaulted on. This made securing further loans even harder for the fledgling Spanish economy. Some historians argue that the Pragmatic Sanction was encouraged in order to please the politically-active liberal financiers, and in fact it was in the interest of loan repayment that the British and French protected the &quot;cristinos&quot; during the war. However, the former statement can be explained by the growing influence of Maria Cristina in the courts.
Furthermore, Spain was undergoing a deflationary spiral caused by both the Napoleonic War and the loss of the colonies, which left Spanish producers without the incredibly valuable market to sell their goods to as well as the Mint without the metal crucial to make coins. In order to protect the local industry, Spain established protectionist policies, which served to greatly encourage a black market. In fact, Great Britain was exporting three times as many products into Gibraltar than into the rest of Spain despite the dramatic discrepancy in population size.

Moreover, Spain&#x27;s agricultural production had greatly stalled during Ferdinand&#x27;s reign, partly due to the wars but also importantly due to a lack of improvements in practices and technology. The effects of poor harvests in 1803-1804 and the most &quot;serious shortages of food in a century and a half&quot; that resulted were exacerbated by the Peninsular War. Still, agriculture accounted for 85% of the Spanish GDP. While output had recovered to pre-war levels, the prices remained unattainable for many peasants. As most of the land was concentrated on the hands of wealthy nobles and the church who had no incentive to increase production, &quot;vast tracks [of land] lay totally uncultivated&quot;. Areas like the Basque Country were privileged exceptions to a Spain where &quot;the majority of the population was made up of landless workers who eked out a miserable existence. One obstacle to increasing the productive use of land were the wide limits on noble, ecclesiastical, and town-owned lands&#x27; sale. These lands could be very profitable, such as in the case in mid-1700s Castile and León where land owned by the Church accounted for one-fourth of rent collected. All in all, unsellable land accounted for more than half of Spain&#x27;s farmland, thus hiking the price of land and making it impossible for small farmers to acquire land.

In fact, many Spanish foods were invented in those times to combat the lack of food. In 1817 one finds the first reference to Spanish omelette as &quot;…two to three eggs in tortilla for 5 or 6 [people] as our women do know how to make it big and thick with fewer eggs, mixing potatoes, breadcrumbs or whatever.&quot;

Ferdinand&#x27;s governmental gridlock only further exacerbated the economic situation, as they were unable to create significant economic policies to tackle the issues or encourage internal demand. In fact, Ferdinand clashed with burghers as to how to manage the rural areas which were now extremely sparsely populated, to the shock of international observers. The sparseness of population as well as the general predicaments of Spanish labourers resulted in gross mismanagement of arable landand inability of Spain to significantly restart industrial and commercial activity after the Napoleonic War. The economic troubles were portrayed at the time as a result of moral faults in society, introduced by either the one&#x27;s political enemies or the war.

=== National Politics ===
In 1823, the Spanish Government during the Trienio Liberal had re-instated the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which had abolished the fueros and established a parliamentary monarchy, among other changes. Ferdinand VII repealed it later in the year after he appealed to European powers of the Congress of Vienna in order to restore his absolute powers and France sent a military expedition. The decade that followed the end of the Trienio became known as the Ominous Decade, in which Ferdinand suppressed his enemies, the press, and the institutional reforms of the liberals. He also established a militia called the &quot;Voluntarios Realistas&quot; (&quot;Royalist Volunteers&quot;) which peaked at 284,000 men in 1832 in order to facilitate this suppression, led by an inspector general who answered only to the King himself and funded independently by permanent tax revenues. They were recruited exclusively from conservatives and declared its aim the protection of the royals against liberal attacks.

This decade was plagued by political instability, with a large ultra-conservative revolt breaking out in 1827 and an unsuccessful British-backed liberal Pronunciamiento in 1831. Ferdinand was unable to control the situation and cycled through ministers, being described by Friedrich von Gentz in 1814: &quot;The king himself enters the houses of his prime ministers, arrests them, and hands them over to their cruel enemies;&quot; and in 14 January 1815: &quot;the king has so debased himself that he has become no more than the leading police agent and prison warden of his country.&quot; This assessment seems accurate, as the king himself described himself as &quot;a cork in a bottle of beer&quot;: as soon as that cork was removed, all the troubles of Spain would explode into the open. In addition, as part of his police state Ferdinand revived the inquisition and expanded it to have &quot;agents in every single village in the realm.&quot;

The divide between liberals and conservatives, both unhappy with Ferdinand&#x27;s reign, was further strengthened by his publication in March, 1830 of the Pragmatic Sanction, which replaced the Salic system with a mixed succession system that would allow his daughters to inherit the throne (he had no male heir). This replaced his brother Charles as next-in-succession with his first daughter Isabella, who would be born later that year in October. It was at this point that the Royalist Volunteers and police, which had become politicized towards conservatism, threatened Ferdinand&#x27;s court as they might support Carlos instead of his heir. Ferdinand died a month before Isabella&#x27;s third birthday, his reign considered one of the worst in Spanish history, and so the kingdom fell into a regency led first by her mother Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies.

A strong absolutist party feared that the regent Maria Christina would make liberal reforms, and sought another candidate for the throne. This was due to her owing her choice as Ferdinand&#x27;s wife to the liberal faction of the court and Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies, wife of Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Francisco and court rival of Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal, wife of Carlos. The natural choice, based on Salic Law, was Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Carlos. The differing views on the influence of the army and the Church in governance, as well as the forthcoming administrative reforms paved the way for the expulsion of the Conservatives from the higher governmental circles. At the same time, moderate royalists and constitutionalist liberals coalesced around their support of the Pragmatic Sanction and against Carlos.

As written by one historian:The first Carlist war was fought not so much on the basis of the legal claim of Don Carlos, but because a passionate, dedicated section of the Spanish people favored a return to a kind of absolute monarchy that they felt would protect their individual freedoms (fueros), their regional individuality and their religious conservatism.This opportunistic view of Carlism is further supported by the fact that &quot;Carlism&quot; was first mentioned in official correspondence in 1824, both after the restoration of absolutism to Spain by the French expedition and more than 35 years after the 1789 succession discussions which Ferdinand ratified in his Sanction.

==== Crisis of 1832 ====
By September of 1832, it was clear that King Ferdinand would soon die. To avert a civil war, Maria Christina sent Antonio de Saavedra y Jofré to ask Carlos to serve as principal advisor during the regency and arrange a marriage between Isabella and Carlos&#x27; son Carlos Luis. Carlos refused on religious grounds. He warned her that God would punish him in the afterlife for giving away a throne that was rightfully his. On September 18, at the urging of Maria Christina who was outnumbered in Court by Carlists, Ferdinand revoked the Pragmatic Sanction. Soon afterwards, however, he regained his health and was no longer in immediate danger of dying (though by that point rumours had been widely published abroad that he had died). This episode spurred the liberals to enact extensive personnel changes in the government, army, bureaucracy, police, and Royalist Volunteers in order to drive out the royalists who had been so close to realizing Carlos&#x27;s claim to the throne. For example, in one dispatch the captain-general of Extremadura proposed the removal of 12 governors, king&#x27;s lieutenants, and garrison adjutants; 1 colonel; 5 field officers of the Royalist Volunteers; 3 employees of the military treasury; 5 employees of the captain-general&#x27;s office; the former chief of police; 7 employees of the treasury office; 1 artillery captain; and 3 post office employees. 

Cea Bermudez&#x27;s centrist government (1 October 1832 - January 1834) inaugurated the return to Spain of many exiles from London and Paris, e.g. Juan Álvarez Mendizabal (born Méndez). The rise of Cea Bermudez was followed by a closer collaboration and understanding with Spain&#x27;s debtors, who in turn clearly encouraged the former&#x27;s reforms and liberalization, i.e. the new liberal regime and the incorporation of Spain to the European financial system. After its formation, Maria Isabella published a manifesto threatening those that would seek any change in the government system (namely, &quot;pure unadulterated monarchy under [...] King Ferdinand VII&quot;). Coverdale suggests this manifesto was inspired by Bermudez&#x27;s philosophy of enlightened despotism. Nonetheless, the political situation in Spain was too fragmented for a moderate government like Bermudez&#x27;s to gain and maintain public support and most of its activity was restrained to controlling potential rebellions from both the Carlists and the liberals. 

On 6 October, Ferdinand named Maria Cristina interim governor and allowed her to publish decrees in his name on both urgent and day-to-day affairs. She quickly re-opened the univerisities (which had been closed as centers of liberal agitation) and removed many captains-generals and garrison town military commanders as well as General Nazario Eguía from their positions. These included Vicente González Moreno, José O&#x27;Donnell, and Santos Ladrón de Cegama, all of whom would later join the Carlists in the civil war. Additionally, the Queen suppressed the tax raised to fund the Royalist Volunteers (which were directly collected by them) and removed the political requirements for joining them. 

On 15 October, Maria Cristina issued a political amnesty for many exiles and liberals (except for those that had voted in favor of the King&#x27;s removal and those that had led armed forces against him). A few weeks later, these former political criminals became eligible to hold office again and consequently the liberals mobilized around the Queen.

== Basque Carlism and the &quot;Fueros&quot; ==

Historically, the loyalty of the Basque regions to the kings of Spain and, until the French Revolution, France depended on their upholding of traditional laws, customs, and special privileges. Their representative assemblies go back to the Middle Ages, yet their privileges had been consistently and progressively devalued by both monarchies. While the fueros that formerly made up the Crown of Aragon and included Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands had been abolished in the Nueva Planta decrees of 1717, the Basques managed to maintain a relative autonomy to the rest of the Spanish Kingdom in thanks to their support of Philip V of Spain in the War of the Spanish Succession.

The centralisers in the Spanish government supported some of the great powers against Basque merchants from at least since the time of the abolition of the Jesuit order and the Godoy regime. First they sided with the French Bourbons to suppress the Jesuits, following the formidable changes in North America after the victory of the United States in the American Revolutionary War. Then Godoy sided with the British against the Basques in the War of the Pyrenees of 1793, and immediately afterwards with the French of Napoleon, also against the Basques. The British interest was to destroy, for as long as possible, Spanish commercial routes and power, which were mainly sustained by the Basque ports and merchant fleet.

The Constitution of 1812 was written without Basque input, but they agreed to it due to the ongoing war against the French. As one example, the 1812 Constitution was signed by Gipuzkoan representatives under the watch of a sword-wielding general Castaños, and tellingly the San Sebastián council representatives took the oath to the 1812 Constitution with the smell of smoke still wafting and surrounded by rubble. This Constitution abolished Basque home rule, and in the following years the &quot;contrafueros&quot; (literally &quot;against fueros&quot;) removed provisions such as fiscal sovereignty and specificity of military draft. The resentment against the growing intervention of Madrid (e.g. attempts to take over Biscayan mines in 1826) and the loss of autonomy was considerably strong.

However, King Ferdinand VII found an important support base in the Basque Country. The 1812 Constitution of Cádiz had suppressed Basque home rule, and was couched in terms of a unified Spanish nation which rejected the existence of the Basque nation, so the new Spanish king garnered the endorsement of the Basques as long as he respected the Basque institutional and legal framework.

Most foreign observers, including Charles F. Henningsen, Michael B. Honan, or Edward B. Stephens, English writers and first-hand witnesses of the First Carlist War, spent time in the Basque districts were highly sympathetic to the Carlists, which they regarded as representing the cause of Basque home rule. A notable exception was John Francis Bacon, a diplomat residing in Bilbao during the Carlist siege of (1835), who, while praising Basque governance, could not hide his hostility towards the Carlists, whom he regarded as &quot;savages.&quot; He went on to contest his compatriots&#x27; approach, denied a connection between the Carlist cause and the defense of the Basque liberties, and speculated that Carlos V would be quick to erode or suppress them if he took the Spanish throne.The privileges of the Basque provinces are odious to the Spanish nation, of which Charles is so well aware, that if he was king of Spain next year, he would quickly find excuses for infringing them, if not their total abolition. A representative government will endeavour to raise Spain to a level with the Basque provinces, – a despot, to whom the very name of freedom is odious, would strive to reduce the provinces to the same low level with the rest.Modern historian Mark Lawrence agrees:The Pretender’s foralism was not proactive but purely in reaction to the fact that the rest of Spain (which had long been stripped of its fueros) had failed to rally to his cause. He was forced to rely on the fueros because no other wing of the Fernandine state, neither the army nor (mostly) the Church, defected to the Carlist cause. In fact, the fueros grew in importance only when military victory seemed impossible in the wake of the failed Royal Expedition, and as Carlist peace feelers voiced a growing willingness to abandon Don Carlos who, since 1834, had been the fueros’ champion.and further notes that &quot;the powers of the fueros themselves were increasingly curtailed by the Carlist Royal Government in the name of the war effort.&quot;

The interests of the Basque liberals were divided. On the one side, fluent cross-Pyrenean trade with other Basque districts and France was highly valued, as well as unrestricted overseas transactions. The former had been strong up to the French Revolution, especially in Navarre, but the new French national arrangement (1790) had abolished the separate legal and fiscal status of the French Basque districts. Despite difficulties, on-off trade continued during the period of uncertainty prevailing under the French Convention, the War of the Pyrenees (1793-1795), Manuel Godoy&#x27;s tenure in office, and the Peninsular War. Eventually, Napoleonic defeat left cross-border commercial activity struggling to take off after 1813.

Overseas commerce was badly affected by the end of the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas (1785), the French-Spanish defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), independence movements in Latin America (started 1808), the destruction of San Sebastián (1813), and the eventual breakup of the Royal Philippine Company (1814). By 1826 all the grand Spanish (including the Basque) fleet of the late 18th century with its renowned Basque navigators was gone, and with it, the Atlantic vocation of the Enlightened Spain.

Notwithstanding the ideology of Basque liberals, overall supportive of home rule, the Basques and their industries were getting choked by the above circumstances and customs on the Ebro, on account of the high levies enforced on them by the successive Spanish governments after 1776. Many Basque merchants advocated in turn for the relocation of the Ebro customs to the Pyrenees, and the encouragement of a Spanish market. However, a majority of Basque consumers benefited from their ability to buy foreign goods without paying Spanish tariffs and participation in the contraband trade.

On Ferdinand VII&#x27;s death in 1833, the minor Isabella II was proclaimed queen, with Maria Christina acting as regent. In November, a new Spanish institutional arrangement was designed by the incoming government in Madrid, homogenising Spanish administration according to provinces and conspicuously overruling Basque institutions.The early attempts of the Viceroy of Navarra to recruit villagers into Cristino ranks failed miserably, even when service wages were offered of double, then treble, what the Carlist insurgents promised. Coverdale summarised four factors as to why this was so: (1) traditional society was still economically viable for most of population, hence liberalism was seen a threat; (2) natural leadership strata (clergy, landowners) lived cheek by jowl with peasants and supported the Carlist cause; (3) the terrain was sufficiently abrupt and broken to prevent the use of cavalry and to facilitate small bands to escape (to change their shirts and fight another day), whilst the landscape was densely populated enough to allow regular food and supplies; and (4) the appearance of the extremely gifted guerrilla leader, Tomás de Zumalacárregui. Other parts of Spain may have had one, or some of these factors, but not all four.In this context the additional importance of the loss of the colonies arises. The basques had traditionally emigrated to the New World in order to get better jobs and deal with their rising population in a highly mountainous region which could not support large populations. The end of this option during a period of accelerated population growth meant that the Basque region &quot;faced a bottleneck of impoverished and underemployed men of military age who had little [to] lose by joining Carlist insurrections&quot;. It is important to note that Basque support for Carlism was &quot;far more conditional than [historian] traditionalists, neo-traditionalists, and even Liberals believed.&quot; As Mark Lawrence writes, &quot;it would be superficial to explain Basque Carlism as a war in defence of the fueros&quot; but also states that &quot;Basque Carlism is also impossible to understand without them, not least because their most outspoken defenders were to be found in Carlist ranks and their most outspoken critics amongst the Cristino Liberals.&quot;

==Contenders==

The people of the western Basque provinces (ambiguously called &quot;Biscay&quot; up to that point) and Navarre sided with Carlos because ideologically Carlos was close to them and more importantly because he was willing to uphold Basque institutions and laws. Some historians claim that the Carlist cause in the Basque Country was a pro-&quot;fueros&quot; cause, but others (Stanley G. Payne) contend that no connection to the emergence of Basque nationalism can be postulated. Many supporters of the Carlists cause believed a traditionalist rule would better respect the ancient region specific institutions and laws established under historical rights. Navarre and the rest of the Basque provinces held their customs on the Ebro river. Trade had been strong with France (especially in Navarre) and overseas up to the Peninsular War (up to 1813), but getting sluggish thereafter.

Another important reason for the massive mobilisation of the western Basque provinces and Navarre for the Carlist cause was the tremendous influence of the Basque clergy whose number per capita was double that of other regions. Basque clergy still addressed the public in their own language, Basque, unlike school and administration, institutions where Spanish had been imposed by then. The Basque pro-&quot;fueros&quot; liberal class under the influence of the Enlightenment and ready for independence from Spain (and initially at least allegiance to France) was put down by the Spanish authorities at the end of the War of the Pyrenees (San Sebastián, Pamplona, etc.). As of then, the strongest partisans of the region specific laws were the rural based clergy, nobility and lower class—opposing new liberal ideas largely imported from France. Salvador de Madariaga, in his book &quot;Memories of a Federalist&quot; (Buenos Aires, 1967), accused the Basque clergy of being &quot;the heart, the brain and the root of the intolerance and the hard line&quot; of the Spanish Catholic Church.

On the other side, the liberals and moderates united to defend the new order represented by María Cristina and her three-year-old daughter, Isabella. They controlled the institutions, almost the whole army, and the cities; the Carlist movement was stronger in rural areas. The liberals had the crucial support of United Kingdom, France and Portugal, support that was shown in the important credits to Cristina&#x27;s treasury and the military help from the British (British Legion or Westminster Legion under General de Lacy Evans), the French (the French Foreign Legion), and the Portuguese (a Regular Army Division under General Count of Antas). The Liberals were strong enough to win the war in two months, but an inefficient government and the dispersion of the Carlist forces gave Carlos time to consolidate his forces and hold out for almost seven years in the northern and eastern provinces.

As Paul Johnson has written, &quot;both royalists and liberals began to develop strong local followings, which were to perpetuate and transmute themselves, through many open commotions and deceptively tranquil intervals, until they exploded in the merciless civil war of 1936-39.&quot;

==Combatants==
Both sides raised special troops during the war. The Liberal side formed the volunteer Basque units known as the Chapelgorris, while Tomás de Zumalacárregui created the special units known as aduaneros. Zumalacárregui also established the unit known as Guías de Navarra from Liberal troops from La Mancha, Valencia, Andalusia and other places who had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Alsasua (1834). After this battle, they had been faced with the choice of joining the Carlist troops or being executed.

The term Requetés was at first applied to just the Tercer Batallón de Navarra (Third Battalion of Navarre) and subsequently to all Carlist combatants.

The war attracted independent adventurers, such as the Briton C. F. Henningsen, who served as Zumalacárregui&#x27;s chief bodyguard (and later was his biographer), and Martín Zurbano, a &quot;contrabandista&quot; or smuggler, who:

soon after the commencement of the war sought and obtained permission to raise a body of men to act in conjunction with the queen&#x27;s troops against the Carlists. His standard, once displayed, was resorted to by smugglers, robbers, and outcasts of all descriptions, attracted by the prospect of plunder and adventure. These were increased by deserters...

About 250 foreign volunteers fought for the Carlists; the majority were French monarchists, but they were joined by men from Portugal, Britain, Belgium, Piedmont-Sardinia, and the German states. Friedrich, Prince of Schwarzenberg fought for the Carlists, and had taken part in the French conquest of Algeria and the Swiss civil war of the Sonderbund. The Carlists&#x27; ranks included such men as Prince Felix Lichnowsky, Adolfo Loning, Baron Wilhelm Von Radhen and August Karl von Goeben, all of whom later wrote memoirs concerning the war.

The Liberal generals, such as Vicente Genaro de Quesada and Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri, were often veterans of the Peninsular War, or of the wars resulting from independence movements in South America. For instance, Jerónimo Valdés participated in the battle of Ayacucho (1824).

Both sides executed prisoners of war by firing squad; the most notorious incident occurred at Heredia, when 118 Liberal prisoners were executed by order of Zumalacárregui. The British attempted to intervene, and through Lord Eliot, the Lord Eliot Convention was signed on April 27–28, 1835.

The treatment of prisoners of the First Carlist War became regulated and had positive effects. A soldier of the British Auxiliary Legion wrote:

The British and Chapelgorris who fell into their hands [the Carlists], were mercilessly put to death, sometimes by means of tortures worthy of the North American Indians; but the Spanish troops of the line were saved by virtue, I believe, of the Eliot treaty, and after being kept for some time in prison, where they were treated with sufficient harshness, were frequently exchanged for an equal number of prisoners made by the Christinos.

However, Henry Bill, another contemporary, wrote that, although &quot;it was mutually agreed upon to treat the prisoners taken on either side according to the ordinary rules of war, a few months only elapsed before similar barbarities were practiced with all their former remorselessness.&quot;

== The contenders ==

=== Carlos, the Church, and the Nobility ===

Carlos had refused to openly challenge either the Pragmatic Sanction nor his brother while the latter remained alive, as the &quot;recent legitimist rising knowns as the Agraviados had taught him the wisdom of awaiting events.&quot; This may be due to nineteenth century Spain being highly politically unstable through endless pronunciamientos. His allies in the courts and important positions of the Spanish state had been purged by the liberals towards the last months of Ferdinand&#x27;s life, weakening various centers of Carlist strength. Few private citizens, however, were persecuted for their political opinions during this time.

In order to strengthen public support, the Carlist created significant amounts of propaganda, both during the war and in the years leading up to it. Carlos&#x27;s refusal to swear an oath to Isabel in a letter to his brother was widely published, as well as a supposed response from universities about Carlos&#x27;s right to the throne and two articles published in French periodicals that also focused on the judicial right of Carlos to the throne. The pamphlets and manifestos are divided into two types: the first includes legal arguments for why Don Carlos was the sole rightful heir to the Spanish throne while the second was composed by political arguments that were often laden with heavily religious overtones.

Most of these propagandist pamphlets published before the war were printed in France by Carlist exiles who then smuggled them into Spain, and so were most widely distributed in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre, Aragon, and Catalonia.

Carlos found allies in the same areas that resisted the Liberals near the end of the Trienio: primarily in upland Navarra and the Basque provinces but also in inland Catalonia, Aragon, Galicia, and Old Castille. One historian called the minor civil war between Liberals and royalists in 1823 &quot;a geographic dress rehearsal for the Carlist War&quot;.

Nonetheless, support for Carlos was not politically uniform. Basque Carlism was socially conservative and supported their stable rural economy, whereas in the Maestrazgo and Catalonia it was more of a protest vehicle for peasants against the negative effects of urbanization and new Liberal property regulations were having on their livelihood Such regulations were threatening to abolish the &quot;de facto&quot; rights to use-ownership of land by peasants and move towards a more contract and cash-based system.

In addition, Carlism did not represent a rural fight against urban development, as &quot;[urban] artisans threatened by recurrent Liberal abolition of the guilds and redundant officeholders (cesantes) could be drawn to Carlism, whilst, by contrast, villagers who had benefited from the Liberal property revolution would correspondingly turn Cristino; flight either from or to the countryside in many cases entrenched a rural (Carlist) versus urban (Cristino) divide, but as an effect rather than a cause of the conflict.&quot;

It is highly likely that there were nobles outside of the three Carlist &quot;heartlands&quot; that were in favour of his cause, but any public show of support would have resulted in the Cristino court banishing those nobles from Madrid and seizing their extensive lands and income. Northern nobles, simply speaking, had much less land to lose. Carlism in Cristino areas can be differentiated into civic and &quot;faccioso&quot; (insurgent) Carlists. The latter were often bandits looking for political cover, while civic Carlists were subject to progressively harsher treatment as the war radicalized Spanish politics.

Overall, the Carlist position can be summarized as a radical reactionary policy to restore the privileges of the church and nobles, decentralise legislative and judicial powers, and bring the monarchy to a more medieval role that was less absolutist and more dependent on nobles. &quot;In other words, the Carlists wanted to revise not just the recent Liberal revolution but the entire eighteenth-century legacy of enlightened absolutism.&quot;

=== Maria Christina, the Great Powers, and the Liberal Government ===
On the other side, the liberals and moderates united to defend the new order represented by María Cristina and her three-year-old daughter, Isabella. They controlled the institutions, almost the whole army, and the cities; the Carlist movement was stronger in rural areas. The liberals had the crucial support of United Kingdom, France and Portugal, support that was shown in the important credits to Cristina&#x27;s treasury and the military help from the British (British Legion or Westminster Legion under General de Lacy Evans), the French (the French Foreign Legion), and the Portuguese (a Regular Army Division, under General Count of Antas).

==== Military ====
It is important to note that the liberals were just as multi-faceted as the Carlists, carrying on the factionalism that had characterized them during the Peninsular War. They disagreed in regards to military, with the &quot;guerilleros&quot; (patriot guerilla bands), the Bourbon army, and the National militia (a part-time citizen&#x27;s force organized at a local level and &quot;in the hands of property owners&quot; which was written into the Constitution yet saw only &quot;ephemeral&quot; involvement at the end of the Napoleonic war) all favored by different politicians and at different times both before and during the war. The national militia was championed by the Liberals during the Trienio, but required a literacy test and ability to afford the uniform from those enlisted. However, they received the same privileges and immunity as the military while having as only requirement the condition of &quot;when active in their duties&quot; which led to significant in-fighting and an &quot;extra-paramilitary double regime&quot; during the Trienio.

The growing anti-militarist sentiment amongst the liberals resulted in the emergence in the Napoleonic War amongst the army of a faction that &quot;was hostile to the whole constitutional experiment&quot; due to the &quot;shabby treatment&quot; received from politicians. Conditions were not significantly better during the Ferdinandine reign, as soldiers faced late payments and inadequate rations and its Liberal officers placed on half-pay or remote garrisons by the distrustful king (many of these officers later led Rafael del Riego&#x27;s &quot;pronunciamiento&quot;).&lt; Note also that conscripts had no &quot;a priori&quot; reason to be committed to the Cristino cause, while officers had a career they were willing to sacrifice their men and military considerations for.

The Liberal generals, such as Vicente Genaro de Quesada and Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri, were often veterans of the Peninsular War, or of the wars resulting from independence movements in South America. For instance, Jerónimo Valdés participated in the battle of Ayacucho (1824).

=== Special troops and foreign volunteers ===
Both sides raised special troops during the war. The Liberal side formed the volunteer Basque units known as the Chapelgorris, while Tomás de Zumalacárregui created the special units known as aduaneros. Zumalacárregui also established the unit known as Guías de Navarra from Liberal troops from La Mancha, Valencia, Andalusia and other places who had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Alsasua (1834).

These were increased by deserters...About 250 foreign volunteers fought for the Carlists; the majority were French monarchists, but they were joined by men from Portugal, Britain, Belgium, Piedmont, and the German states. Friedrich, Prince of Schwarzenberg fought for the Carlists, and had taken part in the French conquest of Algeria and the Swiss civil war of the Sonderbund. The Carlists&#x27; ranks included such men as Prince Felix Lichnowsky, Adolfo Loning, Baron Wilhelm Von Radhen and August Karl von Goeben, all of whom later wrote memoirs concerning the war.

=== Treatment of prisoners ===
Both sides executed prisoners of war by firing squad; the most notorious incident occurred at Heredia, when 118 Liberal prisoners were executed by order of Zumalacárregui. The British attempted to intervene, and through Lord Eliot, the Lord Eliot Convention was signed on April 27–28, 1835.

The treatment of prisoners of the First Carlist War in the Basque region became regulated and had temporary positive effects. A soldier of the British Auxiliary Legion wrote:The British and Chapelgorris who fell into their hands [the Carlists], were mercilessly put to death, sometimes by means of tortures worthy of the North American Indians; but the Spanish troops of the line were saved by virtue, I believe, of the Eliot treaty, and after being kept for some time in prison, where they were treated with sufficient harshness, were frequently exchanged for an equal number of prisoners made by the Christinos.However, Henry Bill, another contemporary, wrote that, although &quot;it was mutually agreed upon to treat the prisoners taken on either side according to the ordinary rules of war, a few months only elapsed before similar barbarities were practiced with all their former remorselessness.&quot; Importantly, the agreement never went into effect outside of the Basque area.

Both sides did not hesitate to execute civilians related to soldiers on the opposing side, such as in the case of Carlist general Cabrera&#x27;s mother.

Prisoners would often be made to fight for their captors, with the only alternative being execution. They also served as military labor, such as in the construction of siege trains.

Prisoners also were the worst sufferers of the long forced marches that were common in the conflict. Most died of hunger or disease in the few months after being captured and were forced to scavenge for food, resorting first to unripe root crops and eventually to cannibalism. For example, during the Royal Expedition Cabrera executed a number of Cristino cannibals that were caught during the act but the prisoners could not even stand up to receive the bullets. Thankfully after some months the surviving prisoners of the expedition were exchanged between sides.

== Logistics ==

=== Army conditions ===
Armies on both sides had difficulties securing food and medical treatment for their troops. The food situation was so bad that Wilhelm von Radhen wrote of Carlos subsisting on &quot;a pan of fried potatoes a day&quot;.

Many wounded would be left for dead on the battlefield or taken to dirty field hospitals with high mortality rates. For example, 3/4 of the wounded Liberals in the Morella campaign died within days. Wounded soldiers, depending on the source, account for 11.1-37% of combat fatalities. However, it is hard to estimate exactly how many soldiers died due to army conditions as contemporary sources often had partisan agendas and distorted figures.

=== Use of Intelligence ===
Carlist forces had significantly superior access to and quality of information due to their support in the regions where the conflict was fought. This allowed them to develop internal lines of communication, which were then used to devastating effect by Carlist generals. As reported by British Ambassador George Villiers, they would use spy networks and flash telegrammes to gather and communicate information. Cristino armies were often forced to use the valleys when travelling in the front lines, while Carlists were able to use hillpaths to transport troops and supplies using mule trains. Cabrera was specially known for diversions, such as driving herds of cattle to leave false footprints or luring enemies by creating false exposed flanks.

=== Defenses ===
While permanent fortresses placed in vantage points and equipped with artillery were used, guerilla patrols and armed farmers often served to control remote hilltops and roads between villages and cities.

==War==
The war was long and hard, and the Carlist forces (labeled &quot;the Basque army&quot; by John F. Bacon) achieved important victories in the north under the direction of the brilliant general Tomás de Zumalacárregui. The Basque commander swore an oath to uphold home rule in Navarre (&quot;fueros&quot;), subsequently being proclaimed commander in chief of Navarre. The Basque regional governments of Biscay, Álava, and Gipuzkoa followed suit by pledging obedience to Zumalacárregui. He took to the bush in the Amescoas (to become the Carlist headquarters, next to Estella-Lizarra), there making himself strong and avoiding the harassment of the Spanish forces loyal to Maria Christina (Isabella II). 3,000 volunteers with no resources came to swell his forces.

=== 1833 ===
==== Northern front ====
In December, Valdes&#x27;s focus on Navarre allowed the Carlists in the other Basque provinces to regroup as the secondary units he left behind only patrolled the main roads and garrisoned the principal towns of the region. As local officials were mostly Carlists, men that returned to their towns were allowed to keep their weapons and thus join the Carlist army again. In response to the developing situation, Valdes established the death penalty for a number of offenses including returning to the Carlist bands after surrendering and accepting a pardon, encouraging or commanding others to join a Carlist band, failing to surrender one&#x27;s weapons or give the authorities information on arms caches, and the distribution of subversive propaganda. Authorities would also face the death penalty if they failed to collect weapons from the inhabitants under them, if they allowed Carlist recruitment, or if they allowed mail in their jurisdiction to be stolen, except when faced by overwhelming force. Those who were reasonably suspected of these crimes but could not be proved guilty were instead sentenced to four years&#x27; hard labor. These measures were relatively ineffective.

Meanwhile, Zumalacárregui regrouped his forces in the Borunda valley along the road between Pamplona and Vitoria, which was conveniently placed between the Urbasa and Andia ranges and provided his troops with many escape routes through which they as locals could escape much more quickly than the Carlist regular troops could follow.

=== 1834 ===
In April 1834, France, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal signed the treaty of the Quadruple Alliance. Under its terms, Pedro IV of Portugal would expel the Carlists and Miguel I from Portugal with the aid of Spanish troops and the British navy. In additional stipulations, France established stricter border controls to prevent the entry of men, weapons, and military supplies into Spain to Carlist hands. Britain also pledged arms and munitions as well as possible naval support if necessary and Portugal promised Spain all possible aid. Even though the treaty was a significant diplomatic victory and lessened the likelihood of Carlists receiving diplomatic recognition or aid from other countries, Spain did not receive much material aid from France or Britain for more than a year afterwards. With state coffers yet again empty and the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot; loan issue with the financiers still not settled, Cea Bermudez&#x27;s government fell.

==== Northern front ====
In summer 1834, Liberal (Isabeline) forces set fire to the Sanctuary of Arantzazu and a convent of Bera, while Zumalacárregui showed his toughest side when he had volunteers refusing to advance over Etxarri-Aranatz executed. The Carlist cavalry engaged and defeated in Viana an army sent from Madrid (14 September 1834), while Zumalacárregui&#x27;s forces descended from the Basque Mountains over the Álavan Plains (Vitoria), and prevailed over general Manuel O&#x27;Doyle. The veteran general Espoz y Mina, a Liberal Navarrese commander, attempted to drive a wedge between the Carlist northern and southern forces, but Zumalacárregui&#x27;s army managed to hold them back (late 1834).
=== 1835 ===

In January, the liberal government of Francisco Martínez de la Rosa successfully narrowly defeated an attempted military coup d&#x27;état and then faced urban uprisings in Málaga, Zaragoza, and Murcia in the spring. The government&#x27;s inability to deal with these crises as well as the lack of military success in the North forced the government to resign in June to be followed by a new government headed by former finance minister José María Queipo de Llano, 7th Count of Toreno.

In April, the British sent a mission under Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans to convince both sides to spare the lives of prisoners and of the wounded as well as tell Don Carlos he had no hope of winning the war (Carlos thought that Eliot had come to propose an agreement which would end the war). Jerónimo Valdés and Zumalacárregui agreed not to kill prisoners, exchange them on a regular basis, respect the wounded, and to not execute political prisoners without trial. However, the agreement which came to be called the Lord Eliot Convention applied only to the Basque Country (although it could be applied to the rest of the country if war spread there). This is because the Liberals argued that Carlist troops outside the Basque Country were not regular troops and thus did not fall under the purview of the treaty. The Carlists themselves did not see the terms of the Convention as applying to foreign troops on the Liberal side.

By this point in the war, Zumalacárregui had so continuously defeated the Carlists that a majority of the Liberal officers in the Reserve Army believed they would only be able to win with foreign intervention. By late May, the government reluctantly requested the French for enough troops to occupy the Basque Country and the British for increased diplomatic and naval support. Britain did not believe this was yet necessary and asked France to limit itself to strengthening its border. France thus also denied the Spanish request. In response and in the face of Carlos&#x27;s near-total control of the Basque Country, Madrid asked to be allowed to recruit volunteers which was agreed to in June. Thus, the British Auxiliary Legion was created and the French Foreign Legion expanded its activities to Spain under the name of the Spanish Legion.

==== Northern front ====
In January, the Carlists took over Baztan in an operation where the general Espoz y Mina narrowly escaped a severe defeat and capture, while the local Liberal Gaspar de Jauregi &quot;Artzaia&quot; (&#x27;the Shepherd&#x27;) and his &quot;chapelgorris&quot; were neutralized in Zumarraga and Urretxu. By May, virtually all Gipuzkoa and seigneury of Biscay were in Carlist hands. Opposing his advisers and Zumalacárregui&#x27;s plan, Carlos V decided to conquer Bilbao, defended by the Royal Navy and the British Auxiliary Legion. With such an important city in his power, the Prussian or Russian Tsarist banks would give him credit to win the war; one of the most important problems for Carlos was a lack of funds.

In the siege of Bilbao, Zumalacárregui was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet. The wound was not serious, he was treated by a number of doctors, famously by Petrikillo (nowadays meaning in Basque &#x27;quack&#x27; or &#x27;dodgy healer&#x27; ). The relationship of the pretender to the throne and the commander in chief was at least distant; not only had they differed in operative strategy, but Zumalacárregui&#x27;s popularity could undermine Carlos&#x27;s own authority, as in the early stages of the war, the Basque general was offered the crown of Navarre and the lordship of Biscay as king of the Basques. The injury did not heal properly, and finally General Zumalacárregui died on June 25. Many historians believe the circumstances of his death were suspicious, and have noted that the general had many enemies in the Carlist court; however, to date no further light has been shed on this point.

==== Southern front ====
Up until this point, the Carlists had not managed to mobilize significantly outside of guerrilla bands that served mostly to prevent the Liberals from fully mobilizing against Zumalacárregui for fear of their growing out of control, particularly in Castile. In March 1835, the government created a reserve of two infantry divisions and a cavalry squadron to guard Castile from Carlist incursions as opposed to following Francisco Espoz y Mina&#x27;s plan to drive away the Carlists. Furthermore, that same month when they attempted to transfer two infantry regiments to the Basque Country from Catalonia, General Manuel Llauder protested to the Secretary of War that doing so would amount to &quot;handing ourselves to the rebels&quot;. General Llauder&#x27;s purges prior to the death of Ferdinand prevented the Carlists from staging a successful uprising immediately after his death and the subsequent defeat at Battle of Mayals as well as capture and execution of General Juan Romagosa further affected the insurrectionists. Nonetheless, the popular base in Catalonia and sizeable guerrilla leaders like Rafael Tristany and Benito &quot;Mosen Benet&quot; Tristany were promising to the Carlists if they could properly mobilize them. In Aragon and Valencia, the successes of Liberal General Jerónimo Valdés effectively destroyed the Carlist fighting force in the area save for small dispersed bands.

In response to the continued successes of Zumalacárregui in the north, Madrid withdrew most of its troops to the south of the Ebro river partly to avoid further defeats and partly to prevent the Carlists from entering Castile.

=== 1836 ===

==== Southern front ====
In the south, the Carlist general Miguel Gómez Damas attempted to establish a strong position there for the Carlists, and he left Ronda on November 18, 1836, entering Algeciras on November 22. But, after Gómez Damas departed from Algeciras, he was defeated by Ramón María Narváez y Campos at the Battle of Majaceite. An English commentator wrote that &quot;it was at Majaciete that [Narváez] rescued Andalucía from the Carlist invasion by a brilliant &quot;coup de main&quot;, in a rapid but destructive action, which will not readily be effaced from the memory of the southern provinces.&quot;

At Arcos de la Frontera, the Liberal Diego de Leon managed to detain a Carlist column by his squadron of 70 cavalry until Liberal reinforcements arrived.

Ramon Cabrera had collaborated with Gómez Damas in the expedition of Andalusia where, after defeating the Liberals, he occupied Córdoba and Extremadura. He was pushed out after his defeat at Villarrobledo in 1836.

=== 1837 ===

Meanwhile, In the east, Carlist general Ramón Cabrera held the initiative in the war, but his forces were too few to achieve a decisive victory over the Liberal forces loyal to Madrid. In 1837, the Carlist effort culminated in the Royal Expedition, which reached the walls of Madrid, but subsequently retreated after the Battle of Aranzueque.

=== 1838 ===
After the death of Zumalacárregui in 1835, the Liberals slowly regained the initiative but were not able to win the war in the Basque districts until 1839. They failed to recover the Carlist fortress of Morella and suffered a defeat at the Battle of Maella (1838).

=== 1839-40 ===
The war effort had taken a heavy toll on Basque economy and regional public finances with a population shaken by a myriad of war related plights—human losses, poverty, disease—and tired with Carlos&#x27;s own absolutist ambitions and disregard for their self-government. The moderate Jose Antonio Muñagorri negotiated as of 1838 a treaty in Madrid to put an end to war (&quot;Peace and Fueros&quot;) leading to the Embrace of Bergara (also Vergara), ratified by Basque moderate liberals and disaffected Carlists across all the main cities and countryside.

The war in the Basque Country ended with the &quot;Convenio de Bergara&quot;, also known as the &quot;Abrazo de Bergara&quot; (&quot;the Embrace of Bergara&quot;, &quot;Bergara&quot; in Basque) on 31 August 1839, between the Liberal general Baldomero Espartero, Count of Luchana and the Carlist General Rafael Maroto. Some authors have written that General Maroto was a traitor who forced Carlos to accept the peace with little focus as to the precise context in the Basque Country.

In the east, General Cabrera continued fighting, but when Espartero conquered Morella and Cabrera in Catalonia (30 May 1840), the fate of the Carlists was sealed. Espartero progressed to Berga, and by mid-July 1840 the Carlist troops had to flee to France. Considered a hero, Cabrera returned to Portugal in 1848 for the Second Carlist War.

== Aftermath ==
=== Demographics ===
Areas not involved in the conflict were not affected demographically, but the main areas of battle were decimated. Cities such as Bilbao (which went from 15,000 to 10,234) lost between a quarter and half of its population. The worst victim was Segura de los Baños, which lost 52% of its inhabitants. Direct losses due to the conflict, especially at the national level, are harder to count due to the state of contemporary statistical records.

=== Economics ===
The war left Spain significantly weakened. During the war, populations in conflict zones were frequently moved to fortified centers, which would destroy the ability of the first location to grow crops (due to loss of labor) and place oversized burdens on the area of the fortified center.

=== Politics ===

The Basques managed to keep a reduced version of their previous home rule (taxation, military draft) in exchange for their (October 1839), now centralized, and divided into provinces.

In 1840, General Baldomero Espartero became premier and regent with the support of the Progressives in Spain. The financial and trading bourgeoisie burgeoned, but after Carlist war the Treasury&#x27;s coffers were depleted and the army pending discharge.

In 1841 a separate treaty was signed by officials of the Council of Navarre (the &quot;Diputación Provincial&quot;, established in 1836), such as the Liberal Yanguas y Miranda, without the mandatory approval of the parliament of the kingdom (the &quot;Cortes&quot;). That compromise (called later the &quot;Ley Paccionada&quot;, the Compromise Act) accepted further curtailments to self-government, and more importantly officially turned the Kingdom of Navarre into a province of Spain (August 1841).

In September 1841, Espartero&#x27;s uprising had its follow-up in the military occupation of the Basque Country, and subsequent suppression by decree of Basque home rule altogether, definitely bringing the Ebro customs over to the Pyrenees and the coast. The region was gripped by a wave of famine, and many took to overseas emigration at either side of the Basque Pyrenees, to America.

Espartero&#x27;s regime came to an end in 1844 after the moderate Conservatives gained momentum, and a settlement was found for the stand-off in the Basque Provinces.

== Legacy ==
The war is often paralleled to the Spanish Civil War a century later. In the words of Mark Lawrence:[...] the enduring stereotype of the &#x27;Two Spains&#x27;—which for so long was deemed central to understanding modern Spain—might have seemed an equally compelling paradigm for the First Carlist War: whereas the Spanish Civil War saw Nationalists and Republicans fighting for their respective hegemonic visions of Spain, the First Carlist War offers a comparable struggle between legitimist Carlists and modernising Liberals which took twice as long to resolve as its successor, exalted relatively more casualties, and even anticipated the International Brigades.Paul Johnson agrees with the characterization, writing &quot;both royalists and liberals began to develop strong local followings, which were to perpetuate and transmute themselves, through many open commotions and deceptively tranquil intervals, until they exploded in the merciless civil war of 1936-39.&quot;

=== Spanish historiography ===
Spanish memory of the conflict is disproportionately based on the Carlist side, even when the vast majority of Spain&#x27;s land and population remained Liberal throughout the conflict. A large factor in this is the official encouragement by the Spanish government at different points in its history (most recently Francoist Spain) of pro-Carlist historians. Francoist historians depicted the Carlist Wars as part of the fight between Roman Catholicism and anti-Spanish liberals that &quot;waging war against their own people&quot;. Melchor Ferrer, for example, authored a 30 volume work on Spanish traditionalism. Marxist historians of the 70s criticized Carlism, but were not as highly influential as their Carlist counterparts. Since the fall of the Franco dictatorship, however, Spanish historiography has become much less partisan.

<text>The Mithridatic Wars were three conflicts fought by the Roman Republic against the Kingdom of Pontus and its allies between 88 and 63 BC. They are named after Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus during the course of the wars, who initiated the hostilities with Rome. Mithridates led the Pontic forces in every war. The Romans were led by various generals and consuls throughout the wars, namely Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus.

The wars began over Pontus and Rome backing differing kings of Cappadocia and Bithynia. The conflicts ended with the death of Mithridates in 63 BC and the annexation of Pontus and Syria by the Roman Republic. The Kingdom of Armenia and the Bosporan Kingdom ruled by Mithridates&#x27;s son, Pharnaces II became allied client states of Rome after the conclusion of the wars.

==Etymology==

The &quot;bellum Mithridaticum&quot; (&quot;Mithridatic War&quot;) referred in official Roman circles to the mandate, or warrant, issued by the Roman Senate in 88 BC declaring war against Mithridates.

Subsequently, historians noticed that the conduct of the war fell into three logical subdivisions. Some of them began to term these subdivisions the &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;, and &quot;Third&quot; in the same texts in which they used the term in the singular. As the Roman Republic faded from general memory, the original legal meaning was not recognized. A few historians folded events prior to the declaration of war into the war.

Today, anything to do with the war can be included under it. Hence, the term &quot;First Mithridatic War&quot; is extended to include the wars between the states of Asia Minor as well as Roman support or lack of it for the parties of these wars. The officers offering this support were acting under other mandates from the Senate; to do anything not mandated was to risk criminal charges at home.

==Wars==

=== Prelude ===
The Mithridatic Wars resulted from Mithridates consolidating his neighboring kingdoms into his realm which was opposed by Rome. Mithridates incorporated the Kingdom of Cappadocia by marrying his sister to its king before killing him and installing his young nephew, Ariarathes the IX, on the throne as a puppet ruler. Mithridates supported a rival claimant to the throne of Bithynia, Socrates Chrestus, as another puppet ruler after overthrowing his half-brother, Nicomedes the IV. Rival claimants to these thrones fled to the Roman Senate to plead their cases over the inheritance disputes and influence of Pontus in their kingdoms. Ariobarzanes, a Cappadocian nobleman, also made his case against Ariarathes the IX and was selected as the senate-approved king of Cappadocia. A senatorial legation was dispatched to head east to supplant the Mithridates-backed kings for Roman-favored ones.

This legation, the Aquilian Legation, was sent from Rome in the summer of 90 BC to install the Rome-supported figures onto the thrones of Bithynia and Cappadocia. The Legation was led by Manius Aquillius, a prominent politician who previously served as consul in 129 BC. The legation gained the army of Cassius, the governor of the Roman province of Asia. Mithridates did not oppose the Roman legation and by the fall of 90 BC both Nicomedes the IV and Ariobarzanes the I were installed as kings of their respective countries without any fighting. With their goal achieved, the legation left the following winter. Before the legation left, however, Aquillius urged the kings to attack Mithridates to repay loans they had taken out previously to bribe senators in supporting their claims.

Nicomedes the IV began hostilities with Mithridates in 90 BC, almost immediately after being installed as king of Bithynia. Nicomedes launched raids into Pontic territory by the spring of 89 BC which led to Mithridates sending delegates to Rome in response to the Roman client state&#x27;s attacks. Rome responded that Bithynia shouldn&#x27;t raid Pontus but didn&#x27;t allow Mithridates to attack Bithynia in retaliation.

In the summer of 89 BC, Mithridates sent an army lead into Cappadocia to remove the Roman-appointed Ariobarzanes the I and occupy the kingdom. This military action went against what the Aquilian Legation had enforced and was used as justification for war against Mithridates and Pontus, beginning war between Rome and Pontus.

===First===
The First Mithridatic War (89–85 BC) resulted from Mithridates sending an army into the Roman ally of Cappadocia to remove its senate-supported king. Rome was busy with the Social War and was slow to direct forces eastward to stop Mithridates. One of the Consuls for the year, Sulla, was dispatched with 5 legions after 18 months of preparations in 87 BC, the first major force sent by Rome since the start of the war.

In 89 BC, Mithridates continued from occupation of Cappadocia to and moved to Bithynia where he defeated Nicomedes the IV, also occupying the kingdom of Bithynia. Following this, Roman forces in the region marshalled an army to force Mithridates back under the direction of Manius Aquillius who was still in Anatolia. Mithridates defeated this force and continue his advance throughout Anatolia unchecked. In 88 BC, Along with the occupation of Cappadocia, Mithridates fully controlled the Roman provinces of Asia and Cilicia.

In spring of 88, Mithridates&#x27;s forces enacted the Asiatic Vespers which saw the systematic killing of Roman and Latin-speaking people in these provinces to remove any Roman influences from his conquered lands. The death toll of these massacres ranged from 80,000 and above. Aristion, an Athenian philosopher was originally sent to Mithridates as ambassador but became close friends with the King and entered into his service. In 88 BC, Mithridates sent Aristion back to Athens, where Aristion convinced its citizens to revolt and declare him Tyrant of Athens. Mithridates also sent Archelaus, one of his generals, with a sizeable Pontic force to aid Aristion against the Romans. The city revolted against Roman rule with support from Mithridates with several other cities joining Athens. Aristion sent Apellicon of Teos with a force to seize the sacred treasury stored at Delos which was still loyal to Rome. Apeilicon sacked the island of Delos, killing approximately 100,000 of its inhabitants before enslaving any left alive. Apeilicon seized the wealth kept on the island, particularly the sacred Treasury of the temple of Apollo the island was famous for before returning to Athens.

Sulla landed in Epirus in 87 BC, before marching on Athens which was the leader of the revolt in Greece. In the summer of that year he besieged Athens; the siege lasted until early 86 when Roman forces broke through the defenses to storm Athens. Aristion and some of his followers retreated into the Acropolis where they were besieged by the Romans until late spring, after which Aristion was killed.

In 86 BC, a Roman force under Lucius Valerius Flaccus was dispatched to apprehend Sulla and defeat Mithridates. Flaccus chose to first deal with Mithridates before Sulla, crossing the Hellespont into Pontic-occupied territory. Flaccus was killed by a mutiny within his forces led by Gaius Flavius Fimbria who took control of the Roman force. Flaccus besieged and took the city of Pergamon where Mithridates was at the time, however, he was unable to stop Mithridates from fleeing to safety by sea.

Archelaus escaped the city with his forces and engaged Sulla in the battle of Chaeronea in central Boeotia. Mithridates sent another of his generals, Taxiles, with reinforcements for Archelaus. The Pontic force outnumbered the Roman one, however, the Romans won the battle, capturing Taxiles and forcing Archelaus to flee with the survivors to Chalcis. While there, Archelaus received reinforcements and returned to mainland Greece where he would engage Sulla again in 85 BC at the Battle of Orchomenus. Archelaus&#x27; force outnumbered the Roman once again, but the Roman force emerged victorious. Archelaus managed to flee the battlefield, returning to Mithridates. Mithridates did not launch another invasion of Greece and withdrew his forces back to Anatolia.

Later in 85 BC, Mithridates and Archelaus met with Sulla at Dardanos to discuss a peace treaty. The war ended with the Treaty of Dardanos. It stipulated that the Kingdoms of Bithynia and Cappadocia would be restored to the Roman-supported kings, but Mithridates would maintain his own kingdom of Pontus. After ending the war, Sulla quickly withdrew back to Rome as a power struggle was developing into a civil war between factions within the senate.

===Second===
The Second Mithridatic War (83–81 BC) began when Roman forces attacked the Kingdom of Pontus, reigniting conflict between Rome and Mithridates. This ended the peace that the previous Treaty of Dardanos in 85 BC which ended the First Mithridatic War three years earlier. The Roman forces were commanded by Lucius Licinius Murena who had served as Sulla&#x27;s legate and was stationed in the region to oversee its defense. Murena ordered an attack on the Pontic city of Comana out of fear that Mithridates was preparing a renewed invasion into Roman territory when Mithridates was raising forces to deal with a rebellion of Crimean tribes in the north.

Murena marched his forces into the Kingdom of Pontus after his attack on Comana, his advance unopposed by Mithridates&#x27;s forces. Mithridates sent an ambassador to Murena to stop the conflict because of the peace established by the treaty of Dardanos, Murena replied that there was no treaty as Sulla hadn&#x27;t written it out. Mithridates plundered Pontic villages in 82 BC before returning to Cappadocia. Mithridates then sent envoys to the Roman senate asking for them to recall the Roman forces that were laying waste to his territory. The senate agreed with Mithridates, ordering Murena to withdraw and end his attack on the Pontic Kingdom; Murena refused and continued the conflict.

Murena was met by a minor Pontic army led by Gordius, one of Mithridates&#x27; generals, later in 82 BC. The Roman and Pontic forces met at the Halys River where they engaged in the ensuing battle of Halys. During the battle the outnumbered Pontic forces stood against superior Roman forces until Mithridates himself arrived with reinforcements, defeating the Romans. The decisive battle was the only major engagement between Roman and Pontic forces in the Second Mithridatic War.

The war ended when Sulla dispatched envoys to Murena to end the conflict as Mithridates hadn&#x27;t broken the treaty they had agreed upon years earlier. Peace was established between Pontus and Rome by 81 BC after which Murena was recalled from Anatolia back to Rome. This peace continued until 74 BC when Mithridates invaded Roman territory in Asia Minor sparking the Third Mithridatic War.

===Third===
The Third Mithridatic War (74–63 BC). The Roman forces were mainly led by Lucius Licinius Lucullus (75–66 BC) and then by Pompey (66–63 BC). Several states were drawn into the war through alliances on both Roman and Pontic sides, like the Kingdom of Armenia on Mithridates&#x27;s side. The war started when the King of Bithynia, an allied client state of Rome, died in 74 BC and granted his kingdom to Rome in his will, Mithridates launched an invasion as this would mean Rome only gained more influence in Asia Minor. Mithridates launched the invasion around the time that Quintus Sertorius, an old supporter of Gaius Marius&#x27;s Populist faction who still opposed the senate, was in the middle of a major revolt against Rome in Hispania.

The Senate responded to Mithridates&#x27;s invasion by sending the consuls Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Marcus Aurelius Cotta, Lucullus to Cilicia, and Cotta to Bithynia. Lucullus&#x27;s force would invade Pontus by land while Cotta&#x27;s force would deal with the Pontic Navy. Cotta&#x27;s forces engaged Mithridates&#x27;s forces at Chalcedon, where Cotta was positioned with his navy. The Roman defenders sallied out of their defenses to fight the Pontic force. However, the Pontic army outnumbered the Roman one, forcing them to withdraw into the city, with at least 3,000 soldiers killed. After this, Mithridates launched a raid on the harbor, destroying four ships and capturing the other 60, several thousand more Roman soldiers died in the fighting before Mithridates left Chalcedon. Cotta&#x27;s force was reduced to a fraction of what it once was, giving Mithridates impunity to take the nearby cities of Nicaea, Lampsacus, Nicomedia, and Apameia.

The city of Cyzicus resisted Mithridates&#x27;s advance, forcing him to besiege it in 73 BC. The city held out until Lucullus&#x27;s arrival with reinforcements that counter-sieged the Pontic army. Mithridates sent a detachment away with the sick and wounded but they were ambushed by the Romans at the Battle of Rhyndacus. Mithridates broke out in the winter of that year, marching towards Lampsacus; Lucullus pursued them, further depleting the Pontic army.

A Pontic navy led by Marcus Marius, a supporter of Sertorius and advisor to Mithridates, set sail into the Aegean Sea. Lucullus would fight the navy at an island near Lemnos, where it was camped, destroying or capturing 32 ships and taking Marius prisoner. After dealing with both the army and navy, Lucullus and Cotta planned out an invasion of Pontus to end Mithridates&#x27;s threat, however before they could, Mithridates seized the important city of Heraclea Pontica. Cotta was tasked with retaking the city while Lucullus would march through the Galatian highlands into Pontus. Cotta began the siege of Heraclea Pontic in 73 BC; it took two years until the city fell to the Romans in 71 BC.

In 72 BC, Lucullus marched through Galatia into the Pontic Heartland without fighting the native Galatians who let the Roman force pass without engaging them. Lucullus directed his army to raid the fertile Pontic heartlands, forcing Mithridates to assemble an army of 40,000 near Cabira to fight Lucullus. Lucullus occupied an old fort overlooking Cabira, Mithridates attacked the Roman position, starting the Battle of Cabira. Mithridates&#x27;s initial attack faltered, allowing the Romans to counterattack. The Pontic army broke and retreated before the Roman position. Mithridates fled eastward into Armenia to his son-in-law and ally, King Tigranes II.

After Mithridates fled Pontus, Lucullus used the opportunity to secure the kingdom, dispatching forces to occupy it. Lucullus directed the siege of Amisus, which was holding out against the Romans, before taking the city. After taking Amisus, Lucullus besieged Sinope, the main port city of Pontus, taking it after fierce resistance. Lucullus stayed in Anatolia while Cotta returned to Rome in 70 BC.

In 69 BC, Tigranes brought Armenia into conflict with Rome after refusing to hand over Mithridates, his father-in-law, to the Romans; Lucullus invaded Armenia the following spring. Lucullus marched on the Armenian capital at Tigranocerta, where he engaged and destroyed a larger Armenian force in the subsequent Battle of Tigranocerta. In the summer of 68 BC, Lucullus marched on Artaxata and defeated another Armenian force at the Battle of Artaxata. He then besieged the city of Nisibis, the main fort and treasury of Northern Mesopotamia. The city fell to Lucullus by the winter of 68 BC.

During the spring of 67 BC, while Lucullus was still at Nisibis, Mithridates returned to Pontus and fought the Roman forces that were still in the region. Legate Gaius Valerius Triarius, who was bringing troops to reinforce Lucullus at the siege of Nisibis, took command of Roman forces in Pontus to fight the sudden return of Mithridates. The Pontic and Roman forces engaged at the Battle of Zela, which the Romans lost, suffering 7,000 casualties, 24 tribunes, and 150 centurions. The loss forced the Romans to withdraw from Pontus, restoring Mithridates to fully control his Kingdom once again.

In the winter of 67 BC, while still sieging Nisibis, Lucullus faced unrest from his soldiers after continuously fighting throughout the war. Lucullus convinced his troops to stay loyal but agreed to march back to Asia Minor and only protect the Roman provinces rather than invading Pontus or Armenia. In the following year, 66 BC, the Senate granted Gnaeus Pompey, one of the influential generals of Rome, command of Roman forces in the east to end the war.

Pompey led his forces into Pontus where he engaged Mithridates at the of the Lycus River in central Pontus by the end of the year. Pompey defeated Mithridates, inflicting at least 10,000 casualties on the Pontic side and causing Mithridates to flee to Colchis. Mithridates crossed the Black Sea in the following year, 65 BC, to the Crimean lands that his eldest son, Machares, held with the support of Rome. After Mithridates landed in Crimea, Machares died, letting Mithridates seize control of the lands from Roman-supported rule.

Following the victory at the Lycus, Pompey marched into Armenia and came to terms with Tigranes, making Armenia an allied state of Rome. By 64 BC, Pompey had established a naval blockade of Bosporan Crimea to wear down Mithridates, before he marched south into Syria where Armenia held lands, he seized important cities across the region like Antioch. In 63 BC, he took cities like Damascus before involving himself in a civil war in Judea to establish it as a client state under Rome.

In 63 BC, Mithridates retreated to the citadel at Panticapaeum where he would try to gather forces to fight the Romans. After his son, Pharnaces II, rebelled against him with the support of a weary populace, Mithridates killed himself. Pharnaces sent his father&#x27;s body to Pompey who granted him the Crimean lands he still held, also establishing him as a Roman ally. The Anatolian and Syrian lands that were occupied would be incorporated as Roman provinces, while Armenia and Judea would become allied client kingdoms allied to Rome. Pompey&#x27;s successes in the war further propelled his political career as the general, granting him a triumph in Rome for his efforts during the war.

==Classical references==
===Diodorus Siculus===
Enough remains of Diodorus Siculus to relate a summary of the Mithridatic Wars mixed in with the Civil Wars in the fragments of Books 37–40.

===Velleius===
A brief summary of the events of the Mithridatic Wars starting with the Asiatic Vespers combined with events of the Civil Wars can be found in Velleius Paterculus, Book II.

===Livy===
The surviving history closest to the Mithridatic Wars is the &quot;History of Rome&quot; by Livy (59 BC – CE 17), which consisted of 142 books written between 27 and 9 BC, dated by internal events: he mentions Augustus, who did not receive the title until 27 BC, and the last event mentioned is the death of Drusus, 9 BC. Livy was a close friend of Augustus, to whom he read his work by parts, which means that he had access to records and writings at Rome. He worked mainly in retreat at Naples. Livy was born a few years after the last Mithridatic War, and grew up in the Late Republic. His location at Padua kept him out of the Civil Wars. He went to the big city perhaps to work on his project. Its nature sparked the interest of the emperor immediately (he had eyes and ears everywhere), who made it a point to be Octavian, not Augustus, to the circle of his friends (he often found duty tedious and debilitating). Livy was thus only one generation away from the Mithridatic Wars writing in the most favorable environment under the best of circumstances.

Only 35 of the 142 books survived. Livy used no titles or period names. He or someone close to him wrote summaries, or &quot;Periochae&quot;, of the contents of each book. Books 1–140 have them. Their survival, no doubt, can be attributed to their use as a &quot;little Livy&quot;, as the whole work proved to be far too long for any copyist. The events of the Mithridatic Wars survive only in the Periochae.

The term &quot;Mithridatic War&quot; appears only once in Livy, in Periocha 100. The Third Mithridatic War was going so badly that the Senators of both parties combined to get the Lex Manilia passed by the Tribal Assembly removing command of the east from Lucullus and others and giving it instead to Pompey. The words of the Periocha are &quot;C. Manilius tribunus plebis magna indignatione nobilitatis legem tulit, ut Pompeio Mithridaticum bellum mandaretur&quot;, &quot;Gaius Manilius, Tribune of the People, carried the law despite the great indignation of the nobility that the Mithridatic War be mandated to Pompey&quot;. The &quot;nobility&quot; are the Senate, who usually had the privilege of mandates. There is a possible pun on &quot;great&quot;, as Pompey had received the title of &quot;The Great&quot; in the service of Sulla, the original recipient of the mandate. Sulla was deceased; Lucullus held the mandate in his place. This is an intervention by the tribune in the legal business of the Senate. Now it was the indignation that was great.

The &quot;Mithridatic War&quot; is not just a descriptive term of the historians; it is the name of a mandate. As such it began with the declaration of war by the Senate in 88 BC after the Asiatic Vespers (modern term), the &quot;casus belli&quot;. Mandates were assigned to the consuls, who, as the name implies, must perform them on penalty for refusal or failure of death. Similarly, only the Senate could declare the termination of a mandate, which is why Livy does not speak of three Mithridatic Wars. Sulla reached an agreement with Mithridates but it was never accepted by the Senate. Interim peace was never anything more than a gentleman&#x27;s agreement. Tiring of this political game the ad hoc peace party bypassed the Senate, not only preempting the mandate but also giving to Pompey the power himself to declare it at an end. It ended automatically, however, with the death of Mithridates in 63 BC, the mission being complete.

===Florus===
Florus writes the briefest of summaries of the Mithridatic War.

===Appian===
Appian of Alexandria (c. 95 – c. CE 165) also covers the Mithridatic Wars in the Foreign Wars section of his Roman History. His account offers the most in depth view of all three conflicts.

<doc id="1070970" wikidata="Q636879" url="?curid=1070970" title="René de Possel">
<text>Lucien Alexandre Charles René de Possel (7 February 1905 – 1974) was a French mathematician, one of the founders of the Bourbaki group, and later a pioneer computer scientist, working in particular on optical character recognition.

==Life==
Possel was born in Marseille. He had the conventional background for a member of Bourbaki: the École Normale Supérieure, agrégation, and then study in Germany. He left Bourbaki at an early stage: there was an obvious personal matter intruding between him and André Weil who had married De Possel&#x27;s ex-wife Eveline following her divorce from De Possel in 1937.

==Work==
De Possel published an early book on game theory in 1936 (&quot;Sur la théorie mathématique des jeux de hasard et de réflexion&quot;). His later research work in computer science at the Institut Blaise Pascal was in a position of relative isolation, as the subject strove for independence and to move away from the imposed role of service provider in the field of numerical analysis. He became director there in 1960, in succession to Louis Couffignal (1902–1966), until an administrative reorganisation under the C. N. R. S. in 1969. He was a leading figure in pushing for the later Institut de Programmation. He died in Paris.

<text>Alexander Henry (4 June 1818–1894) was a Scottish gun maker, based in Edinburgh, and designer of the Henry rifling and barrel used in the Martini–Henry rifle.

He submitted a rifle to the competition organised by the British government for a replacement for their existing Snider–Enfield service weapon. His breech action and barrel were both judged to be the best (and won the prizes). The War Office did not adopt its action, preferring that of Friedrich von Martini, but did adopt its seven-grooved barrel rifling scheme. The resulting Martini-Henry rifle is named after von Martini and himself.

Henry is a fascinating character, from a number of personal tragedies in his family, to some disastrous other business ventures, but he also was the &quot;First Volunteer&quot;, the first signatory to the creation of the Queen’s Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers, Moderator of the High Constables of Edinburgh, a Justice of the Peace, a Freemason (initiated in Lodge St Clair No 349) and an Edinburgh town councillor.

He was admitted to The Royal Scottish Society Of Arts in March 1856.

In 1872 he was appointed &quot;gun and rifle manufacturer to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales&quot;.

In 1873, one of his double rifles was specially made by Henry for Queen Victoria in 1873 and presented it to her personal servant John Brown for Christmas that year. The &quot;extremely rare&quot; Royal .450 double-barrelled hammer rifle was on public display for the first time from June to November 2019 in the National Museum of Scotland&#x27;s Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland exhibition.

He and his wife Isabella had nine children : Eliza Mackay Henry, Jemima Janet Henry, James Alexander Henry (accidentally shot and killed by his father in 1860, aged 12), William Orchardson Henry (died aged 2, possibly named after portrait painter William Quiller Orchardson), Isabella Henry, a stillborn child, Alexander (Alick) Henry, Alice Mills Henry (died aged 1) and John Chave Luxmoore Henry. When Alexander Henry died, he left the business to Alick and John, but they sold it within a couple of months, beginning the slow decline of the &quot;brand&quot;.

The first comprehensive biography of Alexander Henry, &quot;Alexander Henry, Rifle Maker&quot;, was published on 23 November 2017. It was written by gunmaking history author Donald Dallas, with considerable input from Henry&#x27;s great great grandson, Richard Brown.

His grave is in Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh.

<doc id="1070995" wikidata="Q1637663" url="?curid=1070995" title="Sleep sex">
<text>Sexsomnia, also known as sleep sex, is a distinct form of parasomnia, or an abnormal activity that occurs while an individual is asleep. Sexsomnia is characterized by an individual engaging in sexual acts while in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sexual behaviors that result from sexsomnia are not to be mistaken with normal nocturnal sexual behaviors, which do not occur during NREM sleep. Sexual behaviors that are viewed as normal during sleep and are accompanied by extensive research and documentation include nocturnal emissions, nocturnal erections, and sleep orgasms.

Sexsomnia can present in an individual with other pre-existing sleep-related disorders.

Sexsomnia is most often diagnosed in males beginning in adolescence.

Although they may appear to be fully awake, individuals who have sexsomnia often have no recollection of the sexual behaviors they exhibit while asleep. As a result, the individual that they share the bed with notices and reports the sexual behavior.

In some cases, a medical diagnosis of sexsomnia has been used as a criminal defense in court for alleged sexual assault and rape cases.

==Classification==

=== DSM-5 criteria ===
Under DSM-5 criteria, there are 11 diagnostic groups that comprise sleep-wake disorders. These include insomnia disorders, hypersomnolence disorders, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorders, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and substance-medication-induced sleep disorders. Sexsomnia is classified under NREM arousal parasomnia.

====NREM arousal parasomnia ====

Parasomnia disorders are classified into the following categories:
* arousal disorders
* sleep-wake transition disorders
* parasomnias associated with REM sleep

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of sexsomnia include, but are not limited to:
*masturbation/oral sex
*Groping/fondling
*intercourse with climax
*sexual assault or rape
*moaning
*talking dirty while asleep
Sexsomnia often causes self-touching or sexual motions, but it can also cause an individual to seek sexual intimacy with others unknowingly. Sexsomnia may also occur at the same time as other parasomnia activities, such as sleepwalking or talking.
Sometimes it is a partner, roommate, or parent, who first notices symptoms of the condition. Sexual partners might also notice that their partner has an abnormally heightened level of sexual aggression and decreased inhibitions randomly in the night.

A confusing characteristic for those witnessing an individual in an episode of sexsomnia is their eyes being open as this gives the appearance of the individual being awake and conscious, although the individual is completely unconscious and unaware of their actions.

==Causes==
Symptoms of sexsomnia can be caused by or be associated with:
*stress factors 
*sleep deprivation 
*consumption of alcohol or other drugs 
*pre-existing parasomnia behaviors

Sleep deprivation is known to have negative effects on the brain and behavior. Extended periods of sleep deprivation often results in the malfunctioning of neurons, directly affecting an individual&#x27;s behavior. While muscles are able to regenerate even in the absence of sleep, neurons are incapable of this ability. Specific stages of sleep are responsible for the regeneration of neurons while others are responsible for the generation of new synaptic connections, the formation of new memories, etc.

Sexsomnia can also be triggered by physical contact initiated by a partner or another individual sharing the same bed.

=== Risk factors ===
Sexsomnia affects individuals of all age groups and backgrounds but present as an increased risk for individuals who experience the following:
* coexisting sleep disorders
* sleep disruption secondary to obstructive sleep apnea
* sleep related epilepsy
* certain medications
Behaviors such as pelvic thrusting, sexual arousal, and orgasm are often attributed to sleep-related epilepsy disorder. In some cases, physical contact with a partner in bed has been seen to trigger sexsomia behaviors.

Certain medications, including the sedative-hypnotic zolpidem (commonly known by the brand name Ambien) frequently used to treat insomnia, have been seen to increase risk of sexsomnia as an adverse effect.

Like sleep-related eating disorders, sexsomnia presents more commonly in adults than children. However, these adult individuals usually have a history of parasomnia that began in childhood.

== Effects ==
It is possible for an individual who has sexsomnia to experience a variety of negative emotions due to the nature of their disorder. The following are commonly seen secondary effects of sexsomnia: 
* Anger
* Confusion
* Denial
* Frustration
* Guilt
* Revulsion
* Shame
The effects of sexsomnia also extend to those in relationship with the patient. Whether the significant other is directly involved, in the case of sexual intercourse, or a bystander, in the case of masturbation behavior, they are often the first to recognize the abnormal behavior. These abnormal sexual behaviors may be unwanted by the partner, which could lead to the incident being defined as sexual assault.

==Mechanism==
=== NREM sleep ===
Non-rapid eye movement sleep, or NREM, consists of three stages. Stage 1 is described as &quot;drowsy sleep&quot; or &quot;somnolence&quot; and is characterized by breathing rates becoming increasingly more consistent, the beginning of a decrease in muscle activity, and a decrease in heart rate. The typical duration of Stage 1 is around 10 minutes and accounts for approximately 5% of an individual&#x27;s total sleep. Stage 2 is characterized by a further decline in muscle activity accompanied by a fading sense of consciousness of surroundings. Brain waves during Stage 2 are seen in the theta range. Stage 2 accounts for approximately 45-50% of an individual&#x27;s total sleep. Stage 3 is the final stage of NREM sleep and the most common for parasomnias to occur. Also known as slow wave sleep (SWS), Stage 3 is characterized by brain temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure being measured at their lowest. Representing approximately 15-20% of an individual&#x27;s total sleep, brain waves during this stage are seen in the delta range. When an individual awakes during this stage, they are likely to exhibit grogginess and require up to thirty minutes to regain normal function and consciousness.

== Diagnosis ==
Though it is not possible for a definitive diagnosis of sexsomnia, a series of factors are considered to determine the presence of the condition. Clinical tests may also be utilized for further study.

=== Determining factors ===
Determining factors include but are not limited to: 
* a family history of somnambulism or sleepwalking 
* prior episodes of somnambulism 
* disorientation when awoken 
* observed confusional or autonomic behavior 
* amnesia of episode 
* trigger factors the individual possesses 
* lack of regard to conceal episode 
* the nature of event compared to the individual&#x27;s baseline character

=== Clinical tests ===
==== Electroencephalography ====
Electroencephalograms, or EEG, are tests used to depict electrical activity and waves produced by the brain. This test has the ability to detect abnormalities that are associated with disorders that affect brain activity. Episodes of sexsomnia occur most commonly during slow-wave-sleep, or SWS. During this stage of sleep, brain waves tend to slow down and become larger. Through the use of electroencephalography, health professionals are able to determine if the sexual behaviors are occurring during non-REM sleep or if the individual is fully conscious.

==== Polysomnography ====
Polysomnography is a study conducted while the individual being observed is asleep. A polysomnograph (PSG) is a recording of an individual&#x27;s body functions as they sleep. Specialized electrodes and monitors are connected to the individual and remain in place throughout study. Video cameras can be used to record physical behaviors that occur while the subject is asleep. Typically, the unwanted sexual behaviors do not present on film and the majority of information is taken from a sleep study. 

A PSG cannot determine a diagnosis every time it is performed, but can assist in determining what diagnoses should be considered or excluded. While PSG is a useful diagnostic tool, it cannot replace forensic examination. A PSG study may identify sexsomnia, but cannot determine whether it was responsible for an individual&#x27;s actions or present during the time of an alleged crime. Likewise, the study may not identify sexsomnia, but that does not mean that the patient has never experienced it, so it is essential to collect information from as many sources as possible. This could include interviews with friends, family, and significant others, as well as medical records concerning the individual&#x27;s sleep previous patterns.

Polysomnography is also used in the diagnosis of other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and restless leg syndrome.

===== Body functions measured by a PSG =====
* inspiratory and expiratory air flow
* oxygen saturation in blood
* respiratory effort 
* respiratory rate
* eye movements
* brain waves
* electrical activity in muscles
* position of body

==Prevention==
Since there is not an FDA-approved medication on the market specifically designed for the treatment of sexsomnia, health professionals attempt to treat the disorder through a variety of approaches. Among the first line of prevention for sexsomnia involves creating and maintaining a safe environment for all who are affected as a result of the disorder. Precautionary measures include, but are not limited to, the individual in question sleeping in a separate bedroom and the installation of locks and alarms on doors.

==Treatment==
Treatment for sexsomnia involves one or more of the following:
* prescription medications
* CPAP 
* lifestyle changes

===Medications===
Clonazepam has been prescribed as treatment for sexsomnia. This medication is classified as a benzodiazepine and works by acting on the GABA-A receptors present in the central nervous system (CNS). Benzodiazepines open the chloride channels to allow chloride to enter the neuron. The most common use of this medication is for the treatment of anxiety, seizures, panic disorders, and sleep disorders. Anticonvulsant therapy is used to treat sexual behaviors that result secondary to sleep related epilepsy.

=== CPAP ===
Continuous positive airway pressure is commonly used as a treatment for sleep apnea. In cases where the individual has both sleep apnea, and sexual behaviors consistent with sexsomnia, the implementation of a continuous positive airway pressure resulted in complete discontinuation of unwanted behaviors. 

=== Lifestyle changes ===
Positive lifestyle changes are encouraged for individuals with sexsomnia. Reducing stress and anxiety triggers may reduce the likelihood of an exacerbation of the disorder. The use of open discussion and understanding between couples decrease the negative emotional feelings and stress felt and generates a support system.

==Research==
Research findings for sexsomnia first appeared in 1996 publication by Colin Shapiro and Nik Trajanovic of the University of Toronto. In the most recent study of sexsomnia, 832 individuals were surveyed at a sleep disorder center. Among these individuals, 8% reported sexual behaviors consistent with sexsomnia, with men reporting three times more frequently than women.

== Society and culture ==
Sexsomnia has begun to gain attention through its exposure on television, news platforms, and social media outlets.

=== Media exposure ===
Articles regarding sexsomnia continue to circulate on Glamour.com, the Huffington Post, and Refinery29 among many others. Increased exposure has resulted in a conversation between those who have the disorder and those directly affected. Sexsomnia has also been featured in popular television series including &quot;House, MD&quot;, &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

=== Legal cases ===

==== Sex offender controversies ====
The number of alleged sex offenders claiming sexsomnia as the cause of their offenses is rapidly growing. The Australasian Sleep Association has urged qualified physicians to contribute in expert testimony in such cases to ensure the individual&#x27;s claims are valid and not just an attempt to be released of sexual offense charges.

==== &quot;Smith v. State&quot; ====
&quot;Smith v. State of Georgia&quot; officially established a separate affirmative defense for the unconscious. According to the defense, &quot;A person who commits an act during unconsciousness or sleep has not committed a voluntary act and is not criminally responsible for the act.&quot; In order for the assault to be considered a crime by the State of Georgia, the accused must have voluntarily committed the act and exhibited intent to carry out the act.

==== Swedish man acquitted of rape with sexsomnia defense ====
Mikael Halvarsson was acquitted of rape in Sweden due to the sexsomnia defense. Charges were brought against Halvarsson after reports of sexual assault were filed by his girlfriend at the time. Upon investigation, Halvarsson was found still asleep in the alleged victim&#x27;s bed when police arrived. During the appeal, a previous girlfriend of Halvarsson testified of similar behavior she had observed in the past, as well as his mother reporting unusual sleep behaviors beginning at a young age.

==== Rape trial dropped due to victim&#x27;s supposed sexsomnia ====

In 2022, a case came to light in England, where an allegation of rape in 2017 was dropped in 2020 by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) due to expert opinion that the woman involved had sexsomnia, and so the male defendant may have believed that she was consenting, and was thus formally acquitted. The woman involved later appealed the decision. A chief crown prosecutor separate from the department that made the decision to close the case reviewed the evidence of the case again: he concluded that the case should have gone to court; that the expert opinions on sexsomnia should have been challenged in court; and that the decision to close the case was a mistake. The reviewing chief prosecutor apologised unreservedly to the woman when concluding the review. Despite the review, the case could not be reopened because the case had been formally closed and the defendant declared not guilty.

The woman received £35,000 in compensation after her rape case was dropped amid claims she could have had an episode of &quot;sexsomnia&quot;. Kate Ellis, joint litigation lead at the Centre for Women’s Justice, said claims brought by victims against the CPS are legally &quot;difficult&quot;, with payouts &quot;extremely rare&quot;.

==== &quot;R v. Timothy Malcolm Rowland&quot; ====

Timothy Rowland of Sydney, Australia, was acquitted by a jury after successfully claiming a Sexsomnia defence.

In response to an &quot;Inquiry of Concern&quot; from the Jury, Judge J. Pickering instructed that: “No laws about that exist. There are no criminal offences about that that exist. And it’s not for you to create the law”, later commenting that “Someone could not be found guilty of a crime they did unconsciously”.

<text>Ramanuja (&#x27;; [[Middle Tamil]]: Rāmāṉujam; [[Classical Sanskrit]]: Rāmānuja; 1017 – 1137), also known asRamanujacharya, was an Indian Hindu philosopher, guru and social reformer. He is one of the most important exponents of the Sri Vaishnavism tradition in Hinduism. His philosophical foundations for devotional practice were influential in the Bhakti movement.

Ramanuja&#x27;s guru was Yādava Prakāśa, a scholar who according to tradition belonged to the Advaita Vedānta tradition, but probably was a Bhedabheda scholar. Sri Vaishnava tradition holds that Ramanuja disagreed with his guru and the non-dualistic Advaita Vedānta, and instead followed in the footsteps of Tamil Alvārs tradition, the scholars Nāthamuni and Yamunāchārya. Ramanuja is famous as the chief proponent of Vishishtadvaita school of Vedānta, and his disciples were likely authors of texts such as the Shatyayaniya Upanishad. Ramanuja himself wrote influential texts, such as Sanskrit bhāsyas on the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

His Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) philosophy has competed with the Dvaita (theistic dualism) philosophy of Madhvāchārya, and Advaita (non-dualism) philosophy of Ādi Shankara, together the three most influential Vedantic philosophies of the 2nd millennium. Ramanuja presented the epistemic and soteriological importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja&#x27;s case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Ātman (soul) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman.

== Early life ==

Ramanuja was born into a Tamil Brahmin community, in a village called Sriperumbudur (present-day Tamil Nadu) under the Chola Empire. His followers in the Vaishnava tradition wrote hagiographies, some of which were composed in centuries after his death, and which the tradition believes to be true.

The traditional hagiographies of Ramanuja state he was born to mother Kānthimathi and father Asuri Keshava Somayāji, in Sriperumbudur, near modern Chennai, Tamil Nādu. He is believed to have been born in the month of Chithirai under the star Tiruvadhirai. They place his life from 1017–1137, yielding a lifespan of 120 years. However, based on 11th- and 12th-century temple records and regional literature outside the Sri Vaishnava tradition, modern era scholars suggest that Ramanuja might have lived from 1077–1157.

Ramanuja married, moved to Kānchipuram, and studied with Yādava Prakāśa as his guru. Ramanuja and his guru frequently disagreed in interpreting Vedic texts, particularly the Upanishads. Ramanuja and Yādava Prakāśa separated, and thereafter Ramanuja continued his studies on his own.

He attempted to meet another famed Vedanta scholar of 11th-century Yamunāchārya, but Sri Vaishnava tradition holds that the latter died before the meeting and they never met. Ramanuja was the great-grandson of Yamunāchārya through a granddaughter. However, some hagiographies assert that the corpse of Yamunāchārya miraculously rose and named Ramanuja as the new leader of Sri Vaishnava sect previously led by Yamunāchārya. One hagiography states that after leaving Yādava Prakāśa, Ramanuja was initiated into Sri Vaishnavism by Periya Nambi, also called Mahapurna, another Vedānta scholar. Ramanuja renounced his married life, and became a Hindu monk. However, Katherine Young states that evidence on whether Ramanuja led a married or renunciate life is uncertain.

==Career==
Ramanuja became a priest at the Varadharāja Perumal temple (dedicated to the deity Vishnu) at Kānchipuram, where he began to teach that moksha (liberation and release from &quot;samsara&quot;) is to be achieved not with metaphysical, &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman but with the help of personal god and &quot;saguna&quot; Vishnu. Ramanuja believed that when scriptures such as the Vedas declare god as nirguna, they should be interpreted as saying that qualities such as pain, sorrow, mortality and age are absent in god. Ramanuja has long enjoyed foremost authority in the Sri Vaishnava tradition.

===Hagiographies===
A number of traditional biographies of Ramanuja are known, some written in 12th century, but some written centuries later such as the 17th or 18th century, particularly after the split of the community into the  and , where each community created its own version of Ramanuja&#x27;s hagiography. The &#x27; by Brahmatantra Svatantra Jīyar represents the earliest biography, and reflects the view of the succession following Ramanuja. &#x27;, on the other hand, represents the Tenkalai biography. Other late biographies include the &quot;Yatirajavaibhavam&quot; by Andhrapurna.

== Historical background ==
Ramanuja grew up in the Tamil culture, in a stable society during the rule of the Chola dynasty. This period was one of pluralistic beliefs, where Vaishnava, Shaiva, Smarta traditions, Buddhism and Jainism thrived together. In Hindu monastic tradition, Advaita Vedānta had been dominant, and Ramanuja&#x27;s guru Yādava Prākāsha belonged to this tradition. Prior to Ramanuja, the Sri Vaishnava sampradaya was already an established organization under Yamunāchārya, and bhakti songs and devotional ideas were already a part of Tamil culture because of the twelve Alvārs. Ramanuja&#x27;s fame grew because he was considered the first thinker in centuries that disputed Shankara&#x27;s theories, and offered an alternative interpretation of Upanishadic scriptures.

===Early life===
When Ramanuja and his guru Yadava Prakaasa parted ways due to their differences in interpreting the Vedic literature, Ramanuja became a devotee of the Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchi. During this period, Ramanuja&#x27;s discourses and fame reached far and wide. Yamunacharya, the Vaishnavite acharya and the religious head of the Ranganathasamy temple at Srirangam had been closely following Ramanuja from a very young age. When it was time to pass on the legacy, the acharya decided that he would call upon Ramanuja. Accordingly, he summoned Sri Mahapurna, a disciple who was helping him out with the temple affairs and asked him to go to Kanchi and bring Ramanuja.

When Mahapurna met Ramanuja and informed him of his guru&#x27;s desire, Ramanuja was overjoyed and they both immediately left for Srirangam. But bad news awaited them at Srirangam and they both learned that Yamunacharya had died. Heart-broken, Ramanuja then left for Kanchi and refused to worship Sri Ranganatha for he held him responsible for taking away Yamunacharya from this world. As for Mahapurna, he began to assist Tiruvaranga Araiyar, the son of Yamunacharya in managing the temple affairs. But as time passed by, Tiruvaranga Araiyar and other senior members of the Vaishnavite order felt that there was a vacuum after Yamunacharya&#x27;s demise and that they lacked a person who could interpret the Vedas and Sastras like Yamunacharya. So it was finally decided that Sri Mahapurna should once again go and invite Ramanuja to Srirangam.

Meanwhile, in Kanchi, Ramanuja regularly met with Kanchipurna, a fellow devotee, and soon decided that he would become Kanchipurna&#x27;s disciple. When he approached Kanchipurna about this, Kanchipurna politely refused as he did not belong to the same caste as Ramanuja and told him that he would get a more appropriate guru. After this Kanchipurna left for Tirupati to worship Lord Venkateswara and would return only after six months. When he finally came back, it was through him that Lord Varadaraja conveyed his wish to Ramanuja. Accordingly, Kanchipurna advised Ramanuja that it was the Lord&#x27;s wish that he leave for Srirangam and find solace in Sri Mahapurna.

===Induction into Vaishnavism===

After it was decided that Mahapurna would go and invite Ramanuja to Srirangam, the acharya left for Kanchi with his wife. While on his way to Kanchi, Mahapurna and his wife decided to take some rest at Maduranthakam, a place that is located 40 km from present day Chennai. As fate would have it Ramanuja, who was on his way to Srirangam, arrived at the same place and to his joy found Mahapurna. They soon embraced each other and Ramanuja requested that he waste no time in initiating him into the Vaishnavite order. Mahapurna immediately obliged and Ramanuja received the Panchasamskaras (the five sacraments).

===Persecution===
Some hagiographies, composed centuries after Ramanuja died, state that a Chola king, Kulothunga II, had immense hatred towards Sri Vaishnavism. He was called Krimikanta Chola or worm-necked Chola, so called as the king is said to have suffered from the cancer of the neck or throat. Historian Nilakanta Sastri identifies Krimikanta Chola with Adhirajendra Chola or Virarajendra Chola with whom the main line (Vijayalaya line) ended. Knowing the evil intentions of the king, Sri Rāmānujā&#x27;s disciple, Sri Koorathazhwan persuaded Ramanuja to leave the Chola kingdom. Sri Rāmānujā then moved to Hoysala kingdom for 14 years, wherein he converted a Jain king, Bitti Deva to Hinduism after miraculously healing his daughter. Bitti Deva changed his name to Vishnuvardhana. King Vishnuvardhana assisted Sri Rāmānujā to build a temple of Lord Thirunarayanaswamy at Melukote, which is now a temple town in Mandya district of Karnataka. Rāmānujā later returned on his own to Tamil Nādu after the demise of Krimikanta Chola. According to Sastri, Krimikanta or Adhirajendra Chola was killed in a local uprising of the Vaishnavas.

According to &quot;Koil Olugu&quot; (temple records) of the Srirangam temple, Kulottunga III was the son of Krimikanta Chola or Karikala Chola. The former, unlike his father, is said to have been a repentant son who supported Vaishnavism. Ramanuja is said to have made Kulottunga III as a disciple of his nephew, Dasarathi. The king then granted the management of the Ranganathaswamy temple to Dasarathi and his descendants as per the wish of Ramanuja. Some historians hold that Krimikanta, who persecuted Ramanuja, had a personal animosity towards Ramanuja and did not persecute Vaishnavites.

===Reformation===
The Sri Vaishnavite order prior to Ramanuja was not averse to people from other castes as both Kanchipurna and Mahapurna were non-Brahmins. So when Ramanuja revolted against the discrimination that had crept within the caste system, he was simply following the same lines as the Alwars and helped the people who were considered to be untouchables (dasa, dasulu, dasu), to get absorbed into the Sri Vaishnava Bhakti Movement, encouraging them to attain Spiritual enlightenment by teaching them Sri Alwar Divyaprabandham. He called these downtrodden classes as &quot;Tirukulattar&quot;, meaning &quot;of noble descent&quot; in Tamil, and was instrumental in admitting them into the temple in Melukote. Ramanuja&#x27;s liberal views also led to the reorganization of rituals in Srirangam and the involvement of non-Brahmin people in the Vaishnava worship. This policy change contributed to the enhancement of social status for artisanal and other non-Brahmin caste groups, especially the weavers (SenguntharKaikola Mudaliyar) who were one of the chief beneficiaries. After the period of Ramanuja, the Sri Vaishnava community split on this issue and formed the Vadakalai (northern and Sanskritic) and Thenkalai (southern and Tamil) sects. Both sects believe in initiation into Sri Vaishnavism through Pancha Samskara. This ceremony or rite of passage is necessary for one to become a Sri Vaishnava Brahmin. It is performed by Brahmins and non-Brahmins in order to become Vaishnavas.

== Attempts on Ramanuja&#x27;s life ==

There were multiple attempts on Ramanuja&#x27;s life. When he was a student under Yadava Prakasa, the latter grew jealous of Ramanuja&#x27;s rise to fame. So Yadava Prakasa tried to get rid of Ramanuja during a tour to the Ganges in northern India. Govinda, Ramanuja&#x27;s cousin (son of his mother&#x27;s sister), learned of this plot and warned Ramanuja who then left the group and escaped to Kanchi with the help of an elderly hunter couple. Later Yadava Prakasa realised his folly and became a disciple under Ramanuja.

Later another attempt was made on Ramanuja&#x27;s life while he was about to take charge of the temple affairs in Srirangam. The head priest of the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam did not like Ramanuja and decided to kill him. Accordingly, he invited Ramanuja to his house for having food and planned to kill him by poisoning his food. However, when Ramanuja arrived, the priest&#x27;s wife saw the divine glow of Ramanuja and immediately confessed her husband&#x27;s plan. This did not deter the priest who then made another attempt when Ramanuja visited the temple. He poisoned the temple &quot;Theertham&quot; (holy water) and served it to Ramanuja. To the priest&#x27;s great surprise Ramanuja, instead of dying, began to dance with joy. The priest realised his mistake and fell at the feet of Ramanuja.

== Writings ==
The Sri Vaisnava tradition attributes nine Sanskrit texts to Ramanuja – &quot;Vedarthasamgraha&quot; (literally, &quot;Summary of the Vedas&#x27;s meaning&quot;), &quot;Sri Bhashya&quot; (a review and commentary on the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;), &quot;Bhagavad Gita Bhashya&quot; (a review and commentary on the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;), and the minor works titled &quot;Vedantadipa&quot;, &quot;Vedantasara&quot;, &quot;Gadya Trayam&quot; (which is a compilation of three texts called the &quot;Sharanagati Gadyam&quot;, &quot;Sriranga Gadyam,&quot; and the &quot;Vaikuntha Gadyam&quot;), and the &quot;Nitya Grantham&quot;.

Some scholars have questioned the authenticity of all other writings except the three of the largest works credited to Ramanuja — Sri Bhashya, Vedarthasamgraha, and the Bhagavad Gita Bhashya — and the Gadya Trayam he composed in Srirangam.

==Philosophy==

Ramanuja&#x27;s philosophical foundation was qualified monism, and is called &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; in the Hindu tradition. His ideas are one of three subschools in Vedānta, the other two are known as Ādi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita (absolute monism) and Madhvāchārya&#x27;s Dvaita (dualism).

=== Rāmānuja’s Epistemology ===
Rāmānuja&#x27;s epistemology is hyperrealistic or similar to naïve empiricism. The first two sources of knowledge are perception and inference, and they are trustworthy notwithstanding general human subjection to &quot;beginningless ignorance.&quot; Knowledge is always of the real, even in dreams, and error is a disordered perception or faulty inference concerning what is really there. The third source of knowledge is the testimony of scripture, or more strictly, &quot;śabda&quot; (&quot;eternal sound&quot;), which helps to establish much that is uncertain on the basis of sense perception and inference, notably the existence and nature of the ultimate reality (&quot;brahman&quot;). Though unlike some proponents of naïve empiricism, Rāmānuja does not think that it suffices to intermittently have an acquaintance with objects of knowledge. Knowledge (&quot;jñāna&quot;) only occurs when there is direct perception of an object. Unlike proper empiricists, Rāmānuja does not restrict knowledge to that which can be gathered from the senses. Rāmānuja asserts that knowledge about God comes exclusively from the Vedic scriptures, particularly the Upanisads, rather than from sensory perception or logical inference.

Rāmānuja was unique in his view that &quot;bhakti&quot; or devotion is itself an epistemic state. He says that when &quot;bhakti&quot; takes firm root in an individual, it turns into &quot;parabhakti&quot;, which is the highest form of &quot;bhakti&quot; and that &quot;bhakti&quot; is the direct awareness of Brahman&#x27;s nature and thus is a kind of knowledge (&quot;jñāna&quot;).

=== Ramanuja’s Ontology ===
Being a realist, Rāmānuja firmly opposed the notion of &quot;māyā&quot; (illusion). In his understanding, three distinct realities exist: a vast expanse of material objects, countless conscious souls within material bodies, and the transcendent Brahman. Each of these categories possesses a different degree of awareness, from the non-aware material world to the fully-aware Brahman, but they are all equally real. In Rāmānuja&#x27;s interpretation of advaita (non-dualism), it is not a form of advaita as proposed by Shankara. Rāmānuja&#x27;s conception of bhakti maintains that there must always be a separation between the lover (the soul) and the beloved (Vishnu), for true love cannot exist without distinct identities. His stance suggests a qualified non-dualism, where both the souls and the material world, though deeply interconnected with Brahman, eternally remain different from Brahman.

In Rāmānuja&#x27;s philosophy, the foundational concept of the soul-body model revolves around the idea that the entire universe, including both souls (&quot;jivas&quot;) and matter (&quot;prakrti&quot;), serves as the body (&quot;sarira&quot;) of God, referred to as &quot;&quot;sarira-sariri-bhava&quot;, where &quot;sarira&quot; means body and &quot;sariri&quot;&quot; means the indwelling soul or consciousness. This concept is rooted in &quot;sruti&quot; passages like &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; 3.7.3-23:&quot;This soul of yours who is present within but is different from all beings, whom all beings do not know. whose body is all beings, and who controls all beings from within - he is the Inner Controller, the immortal one&quot; - &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; 3.7.14

=== Rāmānuja’s Soteriology ===
According to Rāmānuja, the highest good lies in realizing our true nature and of understanding the true essence of Brahman. &quot;Moksha&quot;, or spiritual liberation, is seen as the joy of contemplating Brahman (rather than release from the life-death-rebirth cycle), and that joy is the result of devotion, praise, worship and contemplation of divine perfection. Knowledge of &quot;Brahman&quot; consists in liberation, for Rāmānuja, mainly because of the character of &quot;Brahman&quot;. According to Ramanuja, Brahman encompasses everything but is not uniform in nature. It includes elements of plurality, allowing it to manifest in a diverse world. Ramanuja views Brahman as a personal god who rules over a real world filled with his spirit. He believes Brahman to have the attributes of “omnipotence, omniscience and infinite love”. He writes:&quot;Entities other than &quot;Brahman&quot; can be objects of such cognitions of the nature of joy only to a finite extent and for limited duration. But &quot;Brahman&quot; is such that cognizing of him is an infinite and abiding joy. It is for this reason that the &quot;śruti&quot; [scripture] says, `&quot;Brahman&quot; is bliss’ (&quot;Taittirīya Upaniṣad&quot; II.6.) Since the form of cognition as joy is determined by its object, &quot;Brahman&quot; itself is joy.&quot;Rāmānuja clarifies that mere theoretical knowledge of &quot;Brahman&quot;‘s nature is insufficient for attaining m&quot;oksha&quot;. According to Rāmānuja, &quot;bhakti&quot; yoga, the discipline of devotion or worship, is the effective means for liberation. In his interpretation, &quot;moksha&quot; is not a negative separation from transmigration, or a series of rebirths, but rather the joy of the contemplating the divine perfection. This joy is attained by a life of exclusive devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) to Brahman, singing his praise, performing adulatory acts in temple and private worship, and constantly dwelling on his perfections. In return, Brahman will offer his grace, which will assist the devotee in gaining release.

=== Ramanuja&#x27;s Ethics ===
Ramanuja&#x27;s ethical framework asserts that morality has both intrinsic and instrumental value. Intrinsically, morality mirrors the divine nature of God, who is morally perfect and needs no external reasons to be moral. Instrumentally, morality serves as a means to alleviate the karmic burdens of past wrongdoings and to appease the divine, thus facilitating spiritual liberation. Ramanuja emphasizes that while detachment through &quot;jnana yoga&quot; is possible in theory, it is impractical for most. Instead, he advocates &quot;karma yoga&quot;, which involves fulfilling duties based on individual capabilities and nature, making morality accessible and suited to individual lives.

=== Criticism of Sankara ===
Ramanuja argued that Shankara&#x27;s interpretation of the Upanishads had serious errors. He had four major objections:

# Brahman was differentiated consciousness and not undifferentiated consciousness.
# Shankara&#x27;s concept of Nirguna Brahman was wrong and untenable.
# Beginningless &quot;karma,&quot; and not superimposition, was the cause of &quot;avidya&quot;.
# Sankara&#x27;s doctrine of Avidya (Ignorance) and Maya (Illusion) has seven major flaws and inconsistencies.

=== Hermeneutic Criticism ===

==== Vedas as Doctrinally Unified Corpus ====
Ramanuja accepted that the Vedas are a reliable source of knowledge, then critiqued other schools of Hindu philosophy, including Advaita Vedānta, as having failed in interpreting all of the Vedic texts. He asserted, in his &quot;Sri Bhāshya&quot;, that &quot;purvapaksin&quot; (previous schools) selectively interpret those Upanishadic passages that support their monistic interpretation, and ignore those passages that support the pluralism interpretation. There is no reason, stated Ramanuja, to prefer one part of a scripture and not other, the whole of the scripture must be considered on par. One cannot, according to Ramanuja, attempt to give interpretations of isolated portions of any scripture. Rather, the scripture must be considered one integrated corpus, expressing a consistent doctrine. The Vedic literature, asserted Ramanuja, mention both plurality and oneness, therefore the truth must incorporate pluralism and monism, or qualified monism.

This method of scripture interpretation distinguishes Ramanuja from Ādi Shankara. Shankara&#x27;s exegetical approach &quot;Samanvayat Tatparya Linga&quot; with &quot;Anvaya-Vyatireka&quot;, states that for proper understanding, all texts must be examined in their entirety, and then their intent established by six characteristics. These include studying what the author states as his goal, what he repeats in his explanation, what he states as his conclusion, and whether it can be epistemically verified. Not everything in any text, states Shankara, has equal weight and some ideas are the essence of any expert&#x27;s textual testimony. This philosophical difference in scriptural studies helped Shankara conclude that the Principal Upanishads primarily teach monism with teachings such as &quot;Tat tvam asi&quot;, while helping Ramanuja conclude that qualified monism is at the foundation of Hindu spirituality.

=== Comparison with other Vedānta schools ===
Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita shares the theistic devotionalism ideas with Madhvāchārya&#x27;s Dvaita. Both schools assert that Jīva (souls) and Brahman (as Vishnu) are different, a difference that is never transcended. God Vishnu alone is independent, all other gods and beings are dependent on Him, according to both Madhvāchārya and Ramanuja. However, in contrast to Madhvāchārya&#x27;s views, Ramanuja asserts &quot;qualified non-dualism&quot;, that souls share the same essential nature of Brahman, and that there is a universal sameness in the quality and degree of bliss possible for human souls, and every soul can reach the bliss state of God Himself. While the 13th- to 14th-century Madhavāchārya asserted both &quot;qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls&quot;, Ramanuja asserted &quot;qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls&quot;, states Sharma.

Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara&#x27;s Advaita school are both nondualistic Vedānta schools, both are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvāchārya believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara&#x27;s theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one&#x27;s unchanging Ātman (soul) as the same as Ātman in everyone else as well as being identical to the &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja&#x27;s theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and &quot;saguna&quot; Brahman with attributes is also real. Ramanuja views Brahman as the inner ruler, all knowing, and the “essence of the soul”. He describes Brahman as the source of intelligence, truth and bliss, and as the controller of the world. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God&#x27;s body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (&quot;saguna&quot; Brahman, Vishnu).

== Influence ==

Harold Coward describes Ramanuja as &quot;the founding interpreter of Sri Vaisnavite scripture.&quot; Wendy Doniger calls him &quot;probably the single most influential thinker of devotional Hinduism&quot;. J. A. B. van Buitenen states that Ramanuja was highly influential, by giving &quot;bhakti an intellectual basis&quot;, and his efforts made bhakti the major force within different traditions of Hinduism.
Modern scholars have compared the importance of Ramanuja in Hinduism to that of scholar Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) in Western Christianity.
Ramanuja reformed the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple complex, undertook India-wide tours and expanded the reach of his organization. The temple organization became the stronghold of his ideas and his disciples. It is here that he wrote his influential Vishishtadvaita philosophy text, &quot;Sri Bhashyam&quot;.

Ramanuja not only developed theories and published philosophical works, he organized a network of temples for Vishnu-Lakshmi worship. Ramanuja set up centers of studies for his philosophy during the 11th and 12th centuries, by traveling through India in that era, and these influenced generations of poet saints devoted to the Bhakti movement. Regional traditions assert that his visits, debates and discourses triggered conversion of Jains and Buddhists to Vaishnavism in Mysore and Deccan region.

The birthplace of Ramanuja near Chennai hosts a temple and is an active Vishishtadvaita school. His doctrines inspire a lively intellectual tradition, and his religious practices continue in major Vaishnava centres like the Ranganātha temple in Srirangam and the Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati.

The &quot;Statue of Equality&quot; in Hyderabad, planned by Chinna Jeeyar, is dedicated to Ramanuja. It was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 5 February 2022.

<text>Poudre B was the first practical smokeless gunpowder created in 1884. It was perfected between 1882 and 1884 at &quot;Laboratoire Central des Poudres et Salpêtres&quot; in Paris, France. Originally called &quot;Poudre V&quot; from the name of the inventor, Paul Vieille, it was arbitrarily renamed &quot;Poudre B&quot; (short for &quot;poudre blanche&quot;—white powder, as distinguished from black powder) to distract German espionage. &quot;Poudre B&quot; is made from 68.2% insoluble nitrocellulose, 29.8% soluble nitrocellulose gelatinized with ether and 2% paraffin. &quot;Poudre B&quot; is made up of very small paper-thin flakes that are not white but dark greenish grey in colour. &quot;Poudre B&quot; was first used to load the 8mm Lebel cartridges issued in 1886 for the Lebel rifle.

==History==
German-Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein created the explosive substance nitrocellulose, or &quot;guncotton&quot;, in 1846 by treating cotton fibers with a nitric acid and sulfuric acid mixture. However, guncotton proved to be too fast burning for direct use in firearms and artillery ammunition. French chemist Paul Vieille then followed the findings of Schönbein in 1882–1884 and, after much trial and error, succeeded in transforming guncotton into a colloidal substance by gelatinizing it in an alcohol-ether mixture which he then stabilized with amyl alcohol. He then used roller presses to transform this gelatinized colloidal substance into extremely thin sheets which, after drying, were cut up into small flakes. This single-base smokeless powder was originally named &quot;Poudre V&quot; after the inventor&#x27;s name. That denomination was later changed arbitrarily to &quot;Poudre B&quot; in order to distract German espionage. The original &quot;Poudre B&quot; of 1884 was almost immediately replaced by improved &quot;Poudre BF(NT)&quot; in 1887. In 1896, &quot;Poudre BF(NT)&quot; was replaced by &quot;Poudre BF(AM)&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Poudre BN3F&quot; in 1901. The latter was stabilized with the antioxidant diphenylamine instead of amyl alcohol, and it gave safe and regular performance as the standard French gunpowder used during World War I (1914–1918). It was followed during the 1920s by &quot;Poudre BN3F(Ae)&quot; and later by &quot;Poudre BPF1&quot;, which remained in service until the 1960s.

Unlike some other countries, French military had been wary of the double-base propellant from the very beginning: (modern research shows that Vielle discovered it already in 1884-1885 and noted its high flame temperatures leading to bore erosion, which led French military to conclude it was unsuitable for military use), only using it for smoothbore mortars after 1918 and in 330-380 mm naval guns in the 1930s.

==Performance==
Three times more powerful than black powder for the same weight, and not generating large quantities of smoke, Poudre B gave the user a huge tactical advantage. It was hastily adopted by the French military in 1886, followed by all the major military powers within a few years.

Prior to its introduction, a squad of soldiers firing volleys would be unable to see their targets after a few shots, while their own location would be obvious because of the cloud of smoke hanging over them. The higher power of the new powder gave a higher muzzle velocity, which in turn produced a flatter bullet trajectory and thus a longer range. It also required lesser volumes of gunpowder and allowed a smaller caliber, thus lighter bullets, so a soldier could carry more ammunition. The French Army quickly introduced a new rifle, the Lebel Model 1886 firing a new 8 mm calibre cartridge, to exploit these benefits.

&quot;Also black powder leaves a heavy residue in the bore. With the best conditions this residue causes a slight falling off of accuracy after from five to fifty shots have been fired from a rifle without cleaning, and when it was attempted to increase the velocity by decreasing the caliber, lengthening the bullet, and increasing the powder charge, the increase in the residue was so great as to destroy the accuracy unless the bore was cleaned after every shot.&quot;

==Stability and safety==
The earliest &quot;Poudre B&quot; tended to eventually become unstable, which has been attributed to evaporation of the volatile solvents, but may also have been due to the difficulty in fully removing the acids used to make guncotton. In the early years of their use both the original Poudre B and guncotton led to accidents. For example, two French battleships, the &quot;Iéna&quot; and the &quot;Liberté&quot;, blew up in Toulon harbour, in 1907 and 1911, respectively, with heavy loss of life. By the late 1890s, safer smokeless powders had been developed, including improved and stabilized versions of &quot;Poudre B&quot; (e.g. Poudres BN3F and BPF1), and ballistite and cordite from the late 1880s. The guncotton problem is not completely solved even today, as an occasional batch of smokeless powder will still deteriorate, although this is extremely rare.

<doc id="1071029" wikidata="Q5568187" url="?curid=1071029" title="Glenbrook, New South Wales">
<text>Glenbrook is a township of the Lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. As of the 2021 Australian census Glenbrook had a population of 5,078 people.

Glenbrook lies between Lapstone and Blaxland at an elevation of 163 metres (535 feet) and is approximately a 50-minute drive from Sydney. It plays host to trendy cafes and boutiques, while offering various tourist attractions, including weekend markets, recreational opportunities and native flora and fauna.

The town takes its name from Glenbrook Creek, which is on the southern side of the village and must be crossed to enter the Blue Mountains National Park. Glenbrook retains many historical homes and buildings throughout the village, although most of these are occupied and not open to the public.

==History==
Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson reached Glenbrook area and Lagoon on their trek across the Blue Mountains on 12 May 1813 and described it as &quot;a large lagoon of good water full of very coarse rushes&quot;.

In 1815, William Cox constructed the first road over the Blue Mountains with a gang of convicts and the Glenbrook area became an important stopping point after a storeroom was built near the lagoon. Governor Macquarie also built a military depot near the lagoon to monitor traffic on the newly built road.

After years of use, Cox&#x27;s road up Lapstone Hill ran into a few problems. It was very steep in sections and in rain became slippery. A new road and stone bridge was built and opened to traffic in 1833 &quot;The Western Road&quot;, at what is today Mitchell&#x27;s Pass, planned and built by Thomas Livingstone Mitchell. The Stone Bridge, Lennox Bridge completed in 1833 and designed by Scottish stonemason David Lennox is the oldest surviving stone bridge on the Australian mainland.

Glenbrook became a town in the 1870s as a result of the arrival of the railway. In 1867 a zigzag railway was built up the Lapstone Hill and on to Weatherboard &quot;Wentworth Falls&quot;. A siding was also built at Glenbrook &quot;Wascoe&#x27;s Siding&quot;, named after an Inn from the local area, water from Glenbrook Lagoon was piped to supply the trains after traversing the Lapstone ZigZag. This Wascoe Siding became a passenger station in 1877. In 1878, Sir Alfred Stephen, Chief Justice and Privy Councillor, decided to give the station a proper name and called it Brookdale, but later it was officially changed to Glenbrook in 1879, named after the nearby creek and Gorge. Glenbrook, which Sir John Jamison thought came from Regents Glen. A village sprung up near the station and was officially proclaimed Glenbrook, six years later.

The Lapstone ZigZag opened in 1867, a part of the ascent of Lapstone Hill on a gradient of 1 in 30–33, which was built up the side of the range with comparatively light earthwork, although it includes the substantial seven-span sandstone Knapsack Viaduct. This was later widened to carry the old Great Western Highway, and it is now part of a walking trail on the old railway/highway alignment, including a memorial to the engineer in charge of the construction of the Blue Mountains line and many other early railways, John Whitton.

In 1892 the first deviation of the railway up the Lapstone Hill, bypassed the Lapstone Zig Zag altogether. A tunnel was built through the hill to the Old Glenbrook station (subsequently dismantled). The 1892 Glenbrook Tunnel ran into trouble with water seeping from the nearby creek and the steep gradient making the climb hard for most trains, often getting stuck in the tunnel.

In 1913 the second deviation of the railway line up Lapstone Hill was completed with a new double-tracked 1913 tunnel at the Bluff Point. The old 1892 Glenbrook Tunnel was subsequently closed. As a result of the new line, the Old Glenbrook station was relocated from next to the Great Western Highway to its current location next to the village of Glenbroook at the end of Ross Street, and was officially opened 11 May 1913.

The abandoned 1892 Glenbrook Tunnel has been used to store mustard gas during World War II, and grow mushrooms in recent times. The eastern entrance can be still seen from a walking track at Lapstone.

On 28 January 1941, an Avro Anson of No. 1 Air Navigation School, Parkes crashed near Glenbrook during a medical evacuation flight from Parkes to the Sydney Airport. All five crew members were killed.

In 1999, the town was associated with the Glenbrook train disaster, when the Trans-Australian Indian Pacific train collided with a V Set commuter train.

Since 2005, the suburb has been the home of The Australian Gnome Convention organised by the Rotary Club of Lower Blue Mountains and held on Australia Day each year. Owners of garden gnomes display their garden decorations and compete for various awards to raise funds for charities.

==Bushwalking==
Glenbrook hosts many walking tracks that can be trekked, including the popular walk to Red Hands Cave, from Glenbrook Causeway, which is a return walk from Glenbrook&#x27;s town centre. On the trail to the caves, along the banks of Camp Fire Creek, there are also aboriginal axe grinding grooves on the Sydney Sandstone.

Glenbrook also has walks that are scenic, but not so well known. This includes the untracked walk to Warrimoo via Glenbrook Gorge and Florabella Pass, and the walk to Blaxland via Pippas Pass.

Additionally, Glenbrook hosts many natural pools and swimming holes, that can be accessed by walking tracks from the town centre, by a few kilometres.

Pools

Glenbrook&#x27;s pools are popular for swimming in, and their tranquillity.

These pools are easily accessed by several walking tracks from the town centre.

Glenbrook&#x27;s Pools include:

* Blue Pool, on Glenbrook Creek
* Jellybean Pool, a popular swimming hole.
* Duck Pool, a few kilometres north upstream from Blue Pool.

Founded in 1975, Lapstone Glenbrook Netball Club was formed from a merger between what was St Peter&#x27;s Netball Club and school-based teams at Lapstone Public School and Glenbrook Public School. St Peter&#x27;s Netball Club was a founding club of the Blue Mountains Netball Association and was run from the church organisation previously based in the St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church building which is now used as a cafe in Glenbrook). Netball is currently the largest participation sport in the Blue Mountains and all matches are played at the Lapstone complex.

Other sporting clubs in the area include:
* Glenbrook Swimming Club
* Glenbrook/Blaxland Cricket Club
* Blue Mountains Football Club
* Glenbrook Panthers Bowling Club
* Glenbrook Little Athletics Club 

Other non-sporting club based recreational activities include:

* Jellybean Pool/Glenbrook Gorge/Blue Pool, entered via the national park (generally free entry on weekdays)
* Endpoint of the Oaks Firetrail, a popular off-road bike route between Woodford and Glenbrook
* Camping at Euroka Clearing where kangaroos can be seen at all times of the day and year (especially summer)
* Bushwalking: Via Euroka Clearing to the Nepean River, Via Evans Track to Warragamba Dam
* Glenbrook Cinema (one of three in the Blue Mountains)
* Glenbrook Swimming Centre (also considered to be in Blaxland)

<doc id="1071039" wikidata="Q6144978" url="?curid=1071039" title="USS Guardfish (SS-217)">
<text>USS &quot;Guardfish&quot; (SS-217), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the guardfish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Guardfish&quot; was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched there on 20 January 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Edward J. Marquart, and commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London New London, Connecticut, on 8 May 1942, Lieutenant Commander Thomas B. Klakring in command.

==First and second war patrols, August – November 1942==
After conducting shakedown out of New London, &quot;Guardfish&quot; left that base on 28 June 1942 for Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal, and arrived there on 25 July to prepare for her first cruise. Her first war patrol was in previously unpatrolled waters off northeast Honshū. &quot;Guardfish&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 6 August 1942, sank a trawler on 22 August, and two days later sank 3,114 ton cargo ship &quot;Seikai Maru&quot; off Kinkasan Harbor. Evading escort vessels, she proceeded up the coast and found a convoy on 2 September. &quot;Guardfish&quot; attacked the next day, sinking 5,253 ton &quot;Kaimei Maru&quot; and 1,118 ton cargo ship &quot;Tenyu Maru&quot;. &quot;Chita Maru&quot;, a 2,376 ton freighter, retreated into the harbor and anchored, but a long-range shot from &quot;Guardfish&quot; left her beached in the mud. &quot;Guardfish&quot; returned from her successful first patrol to Midway for refit on 15 September 1942.

&quot;Guardfish&quot; left Midway on her second war patrol on 30 September and headed for the East China Sea. Surviving an attack by patrolling aircraft on 19 October, &quot;Guardfish&quot; closed a seven-ship convoy 21 October, sinking a 4,000-ton freighter and 6,362 ton &quot;Nichiho Maru&quot; north of Formosa as the convoy scattered. After evading pursuing aircraft and surface ships, &quot;Guardfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 November 1942. For her success on these first two patrols, &quot;Guardfish&quot; received a Presidential Unit Citation.

==Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, January – August 1943==
Moving her base of operations to the Truk area, &quot;Guardfish&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1943 to patrol off the Japanese stronghold. She sank Japanese patrol &quot;Boat No.1&quot; (the former destroyer ) on 12 January west of Kavieng, and a 1,300 ton cargo ship the next day. Attacked by the destroyer on 23 January, &quot;Guardfish&quot; sank her with a well-placed torpedo. Moving south toward Rabaul, she attacked a large convoy near Simpson Harbor, but was driven off by concentrated shore fire and escort attacks. &quot;Guardfish&quot; ended her third patrol by arriving at Brisbane, Australia on 15 February 1943.

Her fourth war patrol was conducted in the Bismarcks, Solomons, and New Guinea area, and &quot;Guardfish&quot; recorded no kills on this cruise, 9 March to 30 April 1943.

Leaving Brisbane for the same waters on 25 May 1943, &quot;Guardfish&quot; sank the transport and hell ship, &quot;Suzuya Maru&quot;, and damaged another before being forced to dive by aircraft on 13 June. She picked up a surveying party on the west coast of Bougainville on 14 July and returned to Brisbane for refit on 2 August 1943.

==Sixth and seventh war patrols, August 1943 – February 1944==
&quot;Guardfish&quot; left Brisbane for her sixth war patrol on 24 August 1943, landing a reconnoitering party on Bougainville and then moving into cruising waters. She sank the 5,460 ton &quot;Kasha Maru&quot; on 8 October and subsequently spent two days as lifeguard ship during the air strikes on Rabaul. &quot;Guardfish&quot; embarked another reconnoitering party on 19 October at Tulagi, landed them on Bougainville, and took vital soundings in Empress Augusta Bay before re-embarking the Marine party on 28 October. These important missions were carried out two days before the American landings at Bougainville. &quot;Guardfish&quot; reached Brisbane, completing her sixth patrol on 3 November 1943.

On 3 December 1943 &quot;Guardfish&quot; was damaged in a collision with an unknown tanker.

Turning to the shipping lanes between Truk and Guadalcanal, &quot;Guardfish&quot; began her seventh war patrol on 27 December 1943, sinking 10,024 ton oiler &quot;Kenyo Maru&quot; on 14 January 1944. She then closed Truk and sank the destroyer on 1 February in an attack on a convoy. After serving briefly as lifeguard ship off Truk she arrived at Pearl Harbor 18 February and from there returned to San Francisco for repairs nine days later.

==Eighth and ninth war patrols, June – October 1944==
&quot;Guardfish&quot; again put to sea from San Francisco and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 June. She then joined submarines , , and to form the coordinated attack group known as the &quot;Mickey Finns&quot;, commanded by Captain W. V. O&#x27;Regan in &quot;Guardfish&quot;.
The submarines patrolled the shipping lanes around Formosa with spectacular success, &quot;Guardfish&quot; sinking 5,863 ton auxiliary &quot;Mantai Maru&quot;, 2,838 ton cargo ship &quot;Hizan Maru&quot;, and 5,215 ton cargo ship &quot;Jinsan Maru&quot; southwest of Formosa on 17 July. After damaging another freighter 18 July, &quot;Guardfish&quot; sank the cargo ship &quot;Teiryu Maru&quot; the next day, barely escaping the attacks of her escorts. She arrived at Midway for refit on 31 July 1944, and for her performance on the eighth patrol was awarded a second Presidential Unit Citation.

Sailing the Sea of Japan as a member of another wolf pack on 23 August 1944, &quot;Guardfish&quot; and the submarines, &quot;Thresher&quot; and , had a 40-minute surface gun battle with sampans on 2 September. On 25 September &quot;Guardfish&quot; attacked and sank 873 ton cargo ship &quot;Miyakawa Maru #2&quot; and returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 October 1944.

==Tenth, eleventh, and twelfth war patrols, November 1944 – June 1945==
&quot;Guardfish&quot; left on 26 November 1944 for her 10th war patrol to cruise in the &quot;Convoy College&quot; area of the South China Sea, with yet another wolf pack. She recorded no sinkings on this cruise, but nearing Guam in the early morning of 24 January 1945 she mistook the U.S. Navy rescue and salvage ship , for a Japanese I class submarine. She fired a torpedo which struck &quot;Extractor&quot;&#x27;s starboard side, causing her to capsize and sink at , within five minutes. Six crew were killed, and the remainder were rescued by &quot;Guardfish&quot;. This action ended the patrol.

&quot;Guardfish&quot;&#x27;s 11th war patrol was spent watching for enemy fleet units attempting to escape from the Inland Sea of Japan by way of the Kii Suido between Shikoku and Honshū. Leaving Saipan on this duty on 27 February, she found no ships but rescued two downed aviators on 19 March before returning to Midway on 11 April 1945.

&quot;Guardfish&quot; left Midway on 8 May 1945 on her 12th and final war patrol, and was assigned lifeguard station for the ever-increasing air attacks on the Japanese mainland. She sank a small trawler by gunfire on 16 June, and arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 26 June 1945.

==Post-war service==
The veteran submarine served with the training command after her return to Hawaii, helping to train surface ships in the newest antisubmarine warfare tactics until 25 August 1945. She then sailed for the United States, transiting the Panama Canal on 12 September and arriving at New Orleans on 16 September. &quot;Guardfish&quot; arrived at New London 6 November and decommissioned there on 25 May 1946.

&quot;Guardfish&quot; remained inactive until 18 June 1948, when she was placed &quot;in service&quot; for duty as a Naval Reserve Training Ship at New London. Declared surplus to Navy needs, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. This ship, one of the most successful of World War II submarines, performed her final service as a target ship for a new submarine torpedo. sank her with the newly developed torpedoes off New London on 10 October 1961.

==Honors and awards==
* Presidential Unit Citation, two awards, one for her first and second war patrols, and a second for her eighth war patrol.
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 11 battle stars for World War II service

Of about 250 American submarines which conducted combat patrols in World War II, &quot;Guardfish&quot; ranked 13th in total tonnage sunk (72,424 tons) and tied for eighth in number of ships sunk with 19.

==In the media==
&quot;Guardfish&quot; was the subject of an article in the 14 December 1942 edition of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine. The article, titled Battle of the Pacific: A Day at the Races and written by an embedded Times staff writer (Clay Blair?), describes the &quot;Guardfish&quot;, either the 1st or 2nd war patrol and Commander Klakring&#x27;s famed sneak into Tokyo Bay; Close enough to watch the horse races through the periscope.

Excerpt from article – &quot;It was a Sunday afternoon. Lieut. Commander Thomas Burton Klakring had run his submarine smack up to Japan&#x27;s shore. Klakring raised his periscope. There was a big seaside town, a race track and a race, which &quot;the whole town&quot; had turned out to see. Klakring &amp; crew placed some bets, &quot;but we were just a little too far away to be sure which horse won.&quot; Anyhow, they were there to provide more exciting diversion for the people of Japan.&quot;

&quot;Guardfish&quot; life on patrol was predominately displayed in the much longer article, featured in the 15 March 1943 publication of &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine. The article is titled West to Japan. US sub patrols the Japanese Coast, watches Horse-races and sinks 70,000 tons of Japanese shipping. By John Field. The article is over 4,000 words and depicts life aboard a submarine, both exciting and mundane. Byline: &quot;This story has 50 heros and one heroine. The heros are the officers and men of an American submarine. The heroine is the ship herself. More than 300 ft. long, with ten torpedo tubes and a surface speed of better than 20 knots, she was commissioned about a year ago. Since that day, she has led an exciting and secret life. On one cruise, to the shores of Japan itself, she sank 70,000 tons of (enemy) shipping. This is the story of that cruise.&quot;

&quot;Guardfish&quot; was the subject of one episode of the syndicated television series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;

<doc id="1071040" wikidata="Q508848" url="?curid=1071040" title="Abd al-Rahman of Morocco">
<text>&quot;Moulay&quot; Abd al-Rahman bin Hisham (; 19 February 1778 – 28 August 1859) was Sultan of Morocco from 30 November 1822 to 28 August 1859, as a ruler of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty. He was a son of Moulay Hisham. He was proclaimed sultan in Fes after the death of Moulay Sulayman.

During his long reign he proved himself competent in an age where Africa was being colonized by stronger European nations, such as neighbouring Ottoman Algeria which was invaded by France. He was able to preserve Moroccan independence and maintain Moroccan borders without ceding any land, while also supporting Emir Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s resistance in Algeria against France. He also signed the necessary treaties to enforce his beliefs, and fought numerous conflicts with European nations, especially France. 

==Biography==
Abd al-Rahman bin Hisham was born in Fes on 19 February 1778 to Hisham bin Mohammed and his wife a lady of the Oulad Jerrar tribe. Following the death of his uncle Sulayman, Abd al-Rahman was proclaimed sultan of Morocco in Fes on 30 November 1822. His reign began during a tumultuous time, when many noble families and rural tribal confederations in Morocco were trying to extract greater power away from the center, and spent much of the early part of his reign crushing revolts. 

Abd al-Rahman was tall and tanned, he was firm in his stance despite his advanced age, and wore simple clothes. Every day, he rode a horse to his garden in Agdal, situated near the gates of Fes. 

The will of Moulay Sulayman to entrust the throne to Abd al-Rahman:

== Reign ==

=== Early reign ===

Upon ascension, the sultan&#x27;s finances were in shambles. With the country in disarray, the central government (the &quot;Makhzen&quot;) was unable to collect much customary taxation. Abd al-Rahman turned to foreign trade, which had been cut off by the prior sultan, as a way to reap in customs revenue, and began to negotiate a series of trade treaties with various European powers.

Moulay Abd al-Rahman was an enthusiastic advocate of foreign trade. As governor of Essaouira he had encouraged European merchants, and after he became sultan, consul after consul trekked down to Marrakesh; the Portuguese in 1823, the British in 1824, the French and the Sardinian in 1825. Each signed a trade treaty, although Morocco had little to export because in 1825 the country began another cycle of poor rainfall and famine.

To recoup his expenses Moulay Abd al-Rahman decided to revive the institution of Barbary piracy and reestablish his corsairing fleet. In 1828 it captured some British ships and an Austrian one. This created confrontations with the British as they blockaded Tangier, and the Austrians bombarded Larache, Asilah and Tetouan in 1829. The final bombardment of a Moroccan city in retribution for piracy occurred in 1851 at Salé.

He was an adept leader and administrator and was able to build public works and infrastructure. He did however have to deal with internal conflicts and had to quell revolts many times: 1824–1825, 1828, 1831–1832, 1843, 1849, 1852, 1853, and 1857–1858. He was always successful at placating the nobles and malcontents though.

=== Expedition of Austria (1829–1830) ===

The navy of the Austrian Empire retaliated with force for the capture of their ship, the &quot;Veloce&quot;, by the Moroccan corsairing fleet. The Austrians resolved to blockading the Moroccan ports, and then opened hostilities and bombarded Larache, Asilah and Tétouan. In June 1829 they landed at Larache and burned Moroccan ships. The Austrian landing at Larache frightened the Moroccan people on a general attack on the Muslims of North Africa, following when war started between the French and the Ottoman province of Algiers in 1827. However, the landing was a complete failure. In 1830, Austria concluded a treaty in which the principal condition was to offer a splendid gift to the sultan.

=== Invasion of Algiers (1830) ===

The most serious foreign threat to Morocco, however, was France, which had launched its invasion of neighboring Ottoman Algeria in 1830. The French landing at Sidi Feruj near Algiers and subsequent French victory in the Battle of Staouéli caused panic in Morocco, while Moroccans expressed solidarity with the Algerians. In the years preceding the French landing, in order to replace revenue lost through the demise of piracy, the Deys (the Ottoman-appointed heads of the Regency of Algiers) had raised taxes, turning the native population against them. The problem of mixed loyalties became even more acute after the French landing. As French forces pushed deeper into the interior, the tribes and city dwellers of the Province of Oran turned to Morocco for help. In the summer of 1830, Abd al-Rahman accepted boatloads of Algerian refugees arriving in the ports of Tangier and Tétouan, ordering his governors to find them housing and settle them into work.

=== Intervention in Tlemcen (1830–1832) ===
Shortly after Algiers fell in 1830, and fearing French invaders, Muhammad Bennouna organised a deputation to ask Moulay Abd al-Rahman to accept a &quot;bay&#x27;a&quot; from Tlemcen. The people of Tlemcen offered Abd al-Rahman the oath of allegiance that would legally establish &#x27;Alawi rule over their region. The Sultan consulted the &quot;&#x27;ulama&quot; of Fez, who ruled that the inhabitants of Tlemcen had already sworn allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and they could not change it now. In September 1830 the Tlemcenis sent another letter arguing that the authority of the Sublime Porte no longer existed, and that its former representatives had been irreligious tyrants. The notables of the beleaguered city kept pressuring for a Moroccan intervention, reminding Abd al-Rahman that the defense of Islam was the duty of the just ruler.

In October 1830 the sultan named his nephew Moulay Ali ben Slimane, who was only fifteen years old, as &quot;Khalifa&quot; of Tlemcen and sent him to take control of Tlemcen. An uncle of the sultan, Idris al-Jarari, the Governor of Oujda, was sent with him to help in protecting the city. The Moroccan troops were warmly welcomed, even in the provinces of Titteri and Constantine. The Moroccan Sultan&#x27;s authority was speedily recognised in all parts of the regency. The &quot;khotba&quot;, or public prayer, was pronounced in all the mosques for the Sultan of Morocco. Everything conspired to confirm the belief that Algeria had peaceably passed under the Moorish sceptre.

Moulay Ali let local rivalries continue unchecked, while his troops pillaged the countryside instead of taking the citadel of Tlemcen, still manned by Ottoman troops. In March 1831 the sultan recalled both of them and nominated the Governor of Tétouan Ibn al-Hami in their place. The Moroccan intervention in Algeria made it clear that the &#x27;Alawi leadership could not orchestrate the popular feelings against the French to their own advantage. In January 1832 France sent an ambassador to Sultan Abd al-Rahman, demanding that he withdraw Morocco’s presence from Tlemcen. The Sultan initially refused to evacuate the city, but when a French warship appeared at Tangier the Makhzen negotiated and the sultan agreed to withdraw his troops. The Moroccan troops evacuated Tlemcen in May. But before Ibn al-Hami left, he appointed a new governor in the sultan&#x27;s name. This was the local head of the Qadiriyya &quot;tariqa&quot;, Muhyi al-Din, who began to organise resistance to the French. In November he handed the leadership to his son, Abd al-Kader. Another embassy was sent by the Marabouts and chiefs to Fez to implore the Moroccan Sultan to provide aid and assistance. Abd al-Rahman complied with their request, by sending a confidential agent to Mascara. This proceeding, however, produced no effect.

=== Wadaya Revolt (1831–1834) ===
As a result of the sultan&#x27;s withdrawal from Tlemcen in March 1831, the Wadaya rebelled in the countryside of Morocco and recognised a relative of the sultan, Mohammed bin al-Tayyib, as sultan. The revolt began in the north and spread throughout Morocco, including the capital Fes, the sultan decided to leave Fes for Meknes which was safer and was protected by the &#x27;Abid al-Bukhari infantry, but on the way to Meknes he was stopped by rebel troops who sent him back to Fes. After the sultan learned about the unpopularity of the chief minister, he dismissed him, took away his wealth, and gave it to the Wadaya as a generous bribe, but this did not stop the rebellion. A few months later, the sultan managed to escape Fes and settle in Meknes, where he slowly built the army there by recruiting more troops. With this army, he marched on Fes and besieged it for 40 days before the Wadaya surrendered in 1834. The sultan ordered the execution of the two most important leaders of the Wadaya revolt, and dispersed them from Fes to Marrakesh, Larache, and Rabat, ending their rebellion.

=== Support for Emir Abd al-Qadir (1832–1844) ===

Abd al-Rahman supported the continued guerrilla resistance in Algeria led by Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza&#x27;iri who was in theory, a vassal of the Moroccan sultan, albeit only tentatively, not wishing to incur French retaliation. But the border tribes of Morocco continued supporting Abd al-Qadir more actively, prompting the French launch their own strikes over the border and establishing forward outposts in Moroccan territory, which only inflamed the reaction in Morocco and increased the irregular border war. The Moroccan army attacked a French military group which France considered a declaration of war. After learning that the Sultan had sent huge forces to the eastern front, Peugeot gave Morocco a deadline of eight days to withdraw its armies from the east, but the Sultan was not convinced.

=== Franco-Moroccan War (1844), and aftermath ===
The French then demanded that Morocco cease its support of Abd al-Qadir and cede its eastern frontier lands to French control and, in 1844, launched the First Franco-Moroccan War. The war did not go well for the sultan. The French navy bombarded Mogador (Essaouira) and Tangier, while the Moroccan army, under Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s son Moulay Muhammad, was defeated by the French at the Battle of Isly in August 1844. Abd al-Rahman consented to the Treaty of Tangier in October 1844, withdrawing support for al-Qadir, and reducing border garrisons.

The treaties aggravated the internal situation in Morocco. Abd al-Rahman in fact rejected the Treaty of Lalla Maghnia at first, blaming it on his negotiators, but was eventually forced to ratify it. Army units and rural tribes across the north and east, already basically ungovernable, started raising rebellions which were only crushed with difficulty. The aftermath saw the break between Abd al-Rahman and Abd al-Qadir.

The crushing defeat at Isly and the bombardment of the Moroccan ports by the squadron commanded by the Prince de Joinville had grave consequences both for the sultan&#x27;s internal authority and for his relations with Europe. The defeat of Isly sparked off tribal rebellions in many parts of Morocco. The Dukkala tribesmen in the region between Safi and El Jadida massacred government officials and looted El Jadida. Essaouira was pillaged by the tribes when its inhabitants deserted it. Rebellious tribes threatened Marrakesh, and in September 1845 Rabat rebelled and its leaders chose a local notable to replace the governor appointed by the sultan. The sultan&#x27;s international standing was also weakened as a result of this defeat. The Scandinavian countries immediately ceased to make him the customary annual gift to retain commercial relations with Morocco. And the sultan, aware that much harm to the country could be avoided through speedy communications wit the European consuls, appointed in 1845 a &quot;na&#x27;ib&quot; (deputy) to conduct relations with them on behalf of the sultan. Though the &quot;na&#x27;ib&quot; resided in, and often held the post of governor of, Tangier, he became in fact if not in title a minister of foreign affairs.

After the defeat of Isly, Moroccan tolerance for Abd el-Qadir&#x27;s use of Morocco to launch raids upon French controlled Algeria waned. Faced with this worsening his relations with the French and the popularity of Abd al-Qadir among his subjects the Sultan would force Abd el-Qadir out.

This prompted the eventual surrender of Abd el-Qadir to the French on the 20th of December 1847.

=== Bombardment of Salé (1851) ===
On 25 November 1851, French ships anchored off Rabat and Salé. Moroccan soldiers in those cities prepared to repel the French attack and armed themselves with artillery. At 10:00 a.m, the French fleet opened fire on the forts of Salé, while the Moroccans retaliated instantly with forty batteries of artillery weapons. An hour later, the batteries in Salé were destroyed, while the artillery in Rabat were damaged to the point where they became almost useless, however Moroccan reinforcements arrived. The damaged batteries were removed from the cities by Moroccan forces who continued to resist. By the end of the bombardment, the Moroccans had 18 to 22 men killed and 47 of them wounded, with many fortifications damaged. On the other hand, the French had losses of 4 killed and 18 wounded, as well as two of their battleships damaged. Both sides claimed victory, as the bombardment ended in a French military victory but also in a Moroccan political victory.
=== Anglo-Moroccan Treaty (1856) ===

In 1856, Britain persuaded the sultan to sign a treaty in Tangier on 9 December 1856, after long negotiations between John Hay Drummond Hay, a representative of Queen Victoria, and Muhammad al-Khatib, a representative of the sultan Abd al-Rahman. Moroccan trade was freed from almost all its monopolies, custom duties were reduced to ten percent of value, Morocco&#x27;s door was opened to a larger volume of overseas trade, and British subjects could own property in Morocco.

== Construction ==
In 1856, Moulay Abd al-Rahman established the souk of Zraqten on the north side of the High Atlas, adding to territory in southern Morocco controlled by the Glaouis, who were Caids ruling various southern areas from the 18th century until Moroccan independence in 1956, after originally settling in Telouet to establish a souk. They would tax caravans travelling from the Sahara and Tafilalt regions as well as taxing goods sold locally.

The Agdal Gardens of Marrakesh, an irrigated garden, originally established by the Almoravids in the 12th century and enlarged in the days of the Saadians was revamped, reforested and encircled by ramparts during the reign of Moulay Abd al-Rahman.

== Armed Forces ==
When Moulay Abd al-Rahman bin Hicham ascended the throne on 30 November 1822, Morocco was an undefeated power with a modern army made up of four main armed forces:
* The Guich military tribes or Makhzen tribes which provided the regular contingents.
* The Black Guard or the &quot;Abid al-Bukhari&quot; who were of Sub-Saharan origin.
* The contingents provided by tribes who paid taxes or provided some contingents of recruits.
* The Holy warriors or the Mujahideen who provided massive levies in case of extreme danger.

== Death ==

Abd al-Rahman died in Meknes on August 28, 1859, and was buried in the Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad, who took the title of sultan Muhammad IV. Immediately upon Sidi Muhammad&#x27;s ascension to throne in August 1859, Spain declared war on Morocco, culminating into the Hispano-Moroccan War in which Spain sent troops to Ceuta in order to capture Tetuan.

<text>Terence John Hamblin (12 March 1943 – 8 January 2012) was a British academic and scientist who was professor of immunohaematology at the University of Southampton from 1987 until his death.

==Life and career==
Born in Worcester, England, Hamblin&#x27;s early years were spent in Aldershot in Hampshire where he and his family lived on Cambridge Road; he was educated at Farnborough Grammar School (1954–1961) and the University of Bristol.

He was appointed as Consultant Haematologist in Bournemouth in 1974. He pursued a research career in haematology and immunology, successively becoming an expert in plasma exchange, stem cell transplantation, monoclonal antibody therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. He was awarded a Guernsey Fellowship for stem cell transplantation in 1986 and the Binet-Rai Medal for outstanding research in CLL in 2002.

He was a prolific author of books, chapters, original peer-reviewed articles, reviews, editorials, and web articles on scientific and medical topics. He was editor of the scientific journal &quot;Leukemia Research&quot; (1986–) and a columnist for the comic/medical political magazine &quot;World Medicine&quot; (1976–84).

His most important research discovery was that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia comes in two forms, depending on whether the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes contain somatic mutations. If they do, the survival of the patient averages 25 years; if they do not, the survival of the patient averages 8 years.

Hamblin presented the BBC 2 episode &#x27;Of Mice and Men&#x27; (1998) in its &quot;Counterblast&quot; series, in which he argued for the use of animals in medical research.

He publicised the fact that, contrary to popular belief, spinach contains no more iron than lettuce, while pink succulent lobster contains none at all; like all invertebrates its respiratory pigment is based on copper rather than iron. He claimed in a 1981 &quot;BMJ&quot; paper that the belief in spinach having a high iron content was due to a decimal point error that was discovered in the 1930s; Mike Sutton published an article in 2010 questioning Hamblin&#x27;s story. In a later article, Sutton discovered that, contrary to popular belief, Hamblin was not the original source of the spinach decimal error myth.

Hamblin died on 8 January 2012 of cancer.

<text>Joseph William Stefano (May 5, 1922 – August 25, 2006) was an American screenwriter, known for adapting Robert Bloch&#x27;s novel as the script for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot;, and for being the producer and co-writer of the original &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; television series.

==Early years==
Stefano was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a father who was a tailor and a mother who made silk flowers. As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to New York City. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.

Stefano&#x27;s initial career was as a composer of pop music in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman Donn Arden. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist Michael Feinstein on the titles of obscure Tin Pan Alley songs.

==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==
Stefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for Martin Ritt with &quot;The Black Orchid&quot; (1959); his mother&#x27;s occupation was an influence on the screenplay.

Stefano was commissioned by Alfred Hitchcock to adapt Robert Bloch&#x27;s novel &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) for his film version. His work was recognized by the Mystery Writers of America when he was given a 1961 Edgar Award, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch&#x27;s utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of serial killer Ed Gein, in the documentary &quot;Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield&quot;, which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003).

Stefano was offered the task of scripting Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) and &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend Leslie Stevens&#x27; science fiction television anthology series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book &quot;Writing with Hitchcock&quot;, Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for &quot;Marnie&quot;.

After leaving &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed &quot;The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre&quot; (1964; aka &quot;The Haunted&quot;), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. The thriller &quot;Eye of the Cat&quot; (1969) and the comedy &quot;Futz&quot; (1969) were Stefano&#x27;s last big-screen work for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many television films such as &quot;Revenge!&quot; (1971), &quot;A Death of Innocence&quot; (1971), &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1972), &quot;Live Again, Die Again&quot; (1974), &quot;Aloha Means Goodbye&quot; (1974) and &quot;Snowbeast&quot; (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1988) entitled &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;. Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with Noel Neill, Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of &quot;Outer Limits&quot; fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.

In 1990, he revisited the characters from &quot;Psycho&quot; with the TV movie script for the prequel, in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot; (1990) posits the origins of Norman Bates&#x27; destructive mother-love, featuring Olivia Hussey as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the Al Pacino drama &quot;Two Bits&quot; (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. Gus Van Sant&#x27;s remake of &quot;Psycho (1998 film)&quot; (1998) followed Stefano&#x27;s script punctiliously, and in the biopic &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (2012) based on the book &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho&quot; by Stephen Rebello, he is portrayed by Ralph Macchio.

Stefano died of a heart attack at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, California, in 2006.

==&quot;The Outer Limits&quot;==
Stefano was a producer for the first season of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:
*&quot;Nightmare&quot;
*&quot;It Crawled Out of the Woodwork&quot;
*&quot;The Zanti Misfits&quot;
*&quot;The Mice&quot; (teleplay)
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Open Till Doomsday&quot;
*&quot;The Invisibles&quot;
*&quot;The Bellero Shield&quot; (story &amp; teleplay)
*&quot;Moonstone&quot; (story)
*&quot;Fun and Games&quot; (teleplay)
*&quot;A Feasibility Study&quot;
*&quot;The Chameleon&quot; (story)
*&quot;The Forms of Things Unknown&quot;
The last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called &quot;The Unknown&quot;, but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.

<text>La Fronde (The Sling) was a French feminist newspaper first published in Paris on 9 December 1897 by activist Marguerite Durand (1864–1936). Durand, a well known actress and journalist, used her high-profile image to attract many notable Parisian women to contribute articles to her daily newspaper, which was the first of its kind in France to be run and written entirely by women. She also had experience on other reputable publications, including &quot;La Presse&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

==Circulation==
&quot;La Fronde&quot; was financed by a donation of 7 million francs, from the Jewish banker Gustave de Rothschild. The paper began publication immediately following the Dreyfus affair, and published feuilletons modeled on mass newspapers. It was published daily initially, from 1897 to 1903, and then was published monthly from 1903 to 1905. Circulation for &quot;La Fronde&quot; briefly reached a peak of 50,000 but in September 1903 it had a massive press run of 200,000. However, financial problems forced the paper to cut back to a monthly publication, and then to close altogether in March 1905. It was revived briefly in 1914 and in 1926.

==Content==
The provocative title of the publication literally means &quot;slingshot&quot; and refers to the 1648–1653 Fronde rebellion against the monarchy in France. The frondeur tradition within journalism derives from this rebellion against Mazarin, the past chief minister of France. This allusion in the title was an alignment with the frondeur notion that marginalized groups had the right to engage in dialogues about matters of importance.

The paper gave extensive coverage to a broad range of feminist issues and profiled such things as Jeanne Chauvin&#x27;s demand that the French government grant her the right to practice law and Madeleine Pelletier&#x27;s argument for her right to become a psychiatrist. To send a message of equality the paper indicated the current date according to a variety of calendars such as the French Revolutionary calendar, the Jewish calendar, and the Gregorian. It was responsible for engaging women in non-domestic issues of social reform and activism, and eventually its focus shifted to emphasize militarism and republicanism, as well as reform of the civil code. The publication&#x27;s revival was an attempt to &quot;galvanize&quot; World War I French patriotism. Immediately prior to the closing of the publication, it had changed its focus to suffragism.

==Gender==
&quot;La Fronde&quot; was highly unusual in its subversion of normative gender relations and roles. For instance, not only were the workers all women, with the exception of the building&#x27;s caretaker, but they were also paid the same wage as men. Furthermore, it was a forum for such topics as sports, education, politics, etc., all of which were traditionally male topics. The journalists on &quot;La Fronde&quot; had to go to great lengths to ensure their access to places which were not open to women, such as Parliament. They would also use pseudonyms, such as Severine, which was the pseudonym of well-known anarchist contributor Caroline Rémy de Guebhard. It was these practices which both concerned and created public interest in the paper. It was widely critiqued as militantly feminist, imitating male styles of writing, and confusing by its representation of conflicting perspectives which lacked continuity. But this last critique was likely in actuality an enactment of the popular strategy in nineteenth century feminism to deconstruct republicanism by pointing out contradictions and inconsistencies. For instance, its inclusion of women who were solely mothers and those in the workforce contested the singularity of women&#x27;s so-called destiny. &quot;La Fronde&quot; monumentally fostered the concept that women were knowledgeable and opinionated on traditionally male issues and spheres, and actively criticized fanciful representations of women in literature and the media.

<doc id="1071060" wikidata="Q3345975" url="?curid=1071060" title="Trinidad and Tobago Carnival">
<text>The Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is an annual event held on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in Trinidad and Tobago. This event is well known for participants&#x27; colorful costumes and exuberant celebrations. There are numerous cultural events such as &quot;band launch&quot; fetes running in the lead up to the street parade on Carnival Monday and Tuesday. Traditionally, the festival is associated with calypso music, developed by enslaved West and Central Africans in 17th century Trinidad; however, Soca music has begun to replace calypso as the more popular musical genre for Carnival. Costume (sometimes called &quot;mas&quot;), stick-fighting, limbo, and steelpan competitions are important components of the festival.

Carnival, as it is celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago, has spread to many other Caribbean islands as well as several cities worldwide. These celebrations include Toronto&#x27;s Caribana, Miami&#x27;s Miami Carnival, Houston Carifest, London&#x27;s Notting Hill Carnival, as well as New York City&#x27;s Labor Day Carnival.

==Origin==
The annual Carnival in Trinidad dates back to the 1780s, when an influx of immigrants from the French West Indies emigrated to Trinidad in response to the Cédula de Población. These immigrants included French planters and &#x27;free coloureds&#x27; (free people of mixed race), as well as enslaved Africans. The Mas tradition started in the late 18th century with French plantation owners organizing masquerades (mas) and balls before enduring the fasting of Lent. Enslaved Africans, who could not take part in Carnival. They are said to have staged their own mini-carnivals, but using their own rituals and folklore and imitating or mocking their masters&#x27; masquerade balls. 

Enslaved Africans also formed parallel celebration called &quot;Canboulay&quot;. Canboulay (from the French &quot;cannes brulés&quot;, meaning burnt cane) The festival was characterized by drums, singing, calinda dancing, chanting, and stick-fighting. Canboulay is considered is a precursor to Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, and has played an important role in the development of the music of Trinidad and Tobago.

Calypso music was developed in Trinidad in the 17th century from the West African Kaiso and canboulay music brought by African slaves imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantations. These slaves, brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and not allowed to talk to each other. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a chantuelle and eventually, calypsonian. Additional traditions were introduced to Trinidad by enslaved Africans during the 18th century. These include the calinda, a form of martial art involving stick-fighting. The calinda is likely of African origin, and is accompanied by music and dancing. 

In 1833, the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act, and Emancipation took effect August 1, 1834. After Emancipation, freed Africans first celebrated their freedom on 1 August the anniversary of their emancipation, and soon began celebrating emancipation during the Carnival season. As part of this transformation, they started carrying burning sugarcane in celebration of Canboulay. The carnival soon featured dancing by men and women in masks. 

During the mid- and late-1800s, the colonial government tried various ways to suppress Carnival and Carnival festivities. These prohibitions resulted in civil disorder, including the Canboulay riots of 1881 and 1884. In 1884, the colonial government passed the Peace Preservation Act, in an attempt to prevent violence breaking out during the Carnival. The Act prohibited public carrying of torches, drumming, blowing horns, and stick-fighting (or the assembly of ten or more people with sticks). It also established the official start of Carnival as 6:00 A.M. (the Monday before Lent).

Steelpan

Stick fighting and African percussion music were banned in 1881, in response to the Canboulay Riots. They were replaced by bamboo &quot;Bamboo-Tamboo&quot; sticks beaten together, which were themselves banned in turn. In 1937 they reappeared, transformed as an orchestra of frying pans, dustbin lids and oil drums. These steelpans (or pans) are now a major part of the Trinidadian music scene and are a popular section of the Canboulay music contests. In 1941, the United States Navy arrived on Trinidad, and the panmen, who were associated with lawlessness and violence, helped to popularize steel pan music among soldiers, which began its international popularization.

J&#x27;ouvert


J&#x27;ouvert (translated from French as &quot;break of day&quot;) symbolizes the start of the official two days of Carnival. Beginning early Monday, revelers parade through town in the tradition of the Canboulay celebrations. &quot;Jouvay&quot; (as it is commonly pronounced and spelled) features a variety of homemade or satirical costumes. The celebration involves participants dousing themselves in oil, mud, and powder, and dancing to calypso and soca music through the streets. This is a stark contrast to the attractive and more formal costumes that are donned later in the day on Carnival Monday and on Tuesday.

== Carnival dates ==
The table shows a list of Trinidad and Tobago Carnival dates from 2009 to 2026.

== Characters ==

A few specific characters have evolved during the history of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s Carnival. Among these characters are:

* Burrokeet – A donkey-riding character, from &quot;burroquito&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;little donkey&#x27;). The costume is constructed so as to give the illusion of a dancer riding a small burro or donkey. This masquerade was brought to Trinidad by Venezuelan settlers.
* Dame Lorraine – A voluptuous woman. The costume parodies the dress of 18th-century French aristocratic women and is stuffed in the hips and bust. Often performed by men.
* Jab Jab – A devil character, from the French Patois &quot;diable&quot; (meaning &#x27;devil). There are Jab Jabs of different colors, including the &quot;Jab Molassi&quot; (molasses devil) cover their bodies in oil from head to toe.
* Midnight Robber – A storytelling character who brags about himself and his valor. The character and costume is influenced by West African dress and storytelling as well as the American Wild West. The character wears an oversized hat, which comes in different shapes and colors.
* Minstrels – A group of singers, often with instruments. The singers would sometimes dress in whiteface, parodying the white American minstrels who dressed in blackface.
* Moko jumbie – A stilt dancer. The character is of African origin. Originally the character wore a hat made of dried wild cucumbers, and the stilts were striped.
* Pierrot Grenade – A jester pretending to be a scholar. The character is a paradoy of the Pierrot character, which was a character from the Carnival balls held by the French planter class in late 18th century Trinidad. The Pierrot character was a well-dressed scholar who boasted about his knowledge. The Pierrot Grenade&#x27;s costume is made of scraps of cloth pieced together.

<doc id="1071061" wikidata="Q509519" url="?curid=1071061" title="Potton, Quebec">
<text>Potton is a township municipality of about 2,500 people in the Memphrémagog Regional County Municipality. It is located on the western shore of Lake Memphremagog in the Estrie (Eastern Townships) region of Quebec, and is one of the municipalities in Brome County. Potton is located about southeast of Montreal, to the southwest of the city of Magog, and next to the United States border, north of North Troy, Vermont.

Potton Township (Canton de Potton) consists of several villages and hamlets that include Potton Springs, Mansonville, Highwater, Dunkin, Province Hill, Leadville, Vale Perkins, Perkins Landing, and Knowlton&#x27;s Landing.

Of these, Mansonville is the business center and the seat of government (Municipalite du canton de Potton) for the township. Formerly a sleepy community, Mansonville has experienced some growth and prosperity because of its proximity to the Owl&#x27;s Head ski resort. Like many Eastern Townships and New England villages, Mansonville grew up around a water-powered mill which exploited a head of water above a fall on the North Branch of the Missisquoi River. The mill ceased operating with electrification in the early 20th century, which allowed economies of scale and centralized manufacturing in larger centres. It operated as a feed and grain mill until 2004, when it was destroyed by fire. Overlooking the mill site is the mansion of the Manson family that founded the town. The mansion has since become a bed and breakfast.

The Newport Subdivision of the Central Maine and Quebec Railway railroad (a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway) route from Newport, Vermont to Richford, Vermont traverses the township at Highwater and follows the Mississquoi River.

The single runway Mansonville Airport (CSK4) is located near Highwater, on chemin de l&#x27;Aeroport.

Mansonville, like many Eastern Townships communities, has long had a mixture of French and English-speaking residents and is home to over twenty nationalities and ethnic groups. Religious diversity is present, and in Mansonville, Roman Catholic, United (closed 2011) and Anglican churches are located a few yards apart. Mansonville was also the home of Russian Orthodox prelate Metropolitan Vitaly Ustinov for some five decades until his death in 2006.

==History==
The area encompassed by the township is part of the larger territory originally inhabited by the Abenaki tribe. There are no known permanent Abenaki habitation sites in the township. The area was used by them for hunting and fishing. Lake Memphremagog and the Missisquoi River were important trade and travel routes. Perkins Landing (approx. 45.092447, -72.295008) is considered to be one end of the portage from Lake Memphremagog to the Missisquoi River. A number of place names originate from them:

*Owl&#x27;s Head is the English name for the mountain called &quot;Walowadjo&quot;. From the Abenaki language, &quot;walo&quot; translates as &quot;saw-whet owl&quot; (aegolius acadicus); &quot;wadjo&quot; translates as &quot;mountain&quot;.
*Owl&#x27;s Head was also called &quot;Waloimudupsek&quot;: &quot;walo&quot; translates as &quot;saw-whet owl&quot; (aegolius acadicus); &quot;imudups&quot; translates as &quot;head&quot;; &quot;ek&quot; translates as &quot;location&quot;.
*Memphremagog comes from the word &quot;Memrahabegek&quot;, which means &quot;where there is a big expanse of water&quot;.
*Memphremagog was also pronounced as &quot;Mamphremagog&quot;. This came from the Abenakis &quot;Mamlawbagak&quot; which signifies &quot;a long and large sheet of water&quot;. The prefix &quot;mamlaw&quot; denotes largeness or abundance; the particule &quot;baga&quot; denotes water; and &quot;k&quot; marks the name as given in local term.
*Missisquoi comes from the word &quot;Masipskoik&quot;, which means &quot;a place where there are boulders&quot;, more specifically &quot;boulders point&quot;.
*Missisquoi also comes from the Abenakis &quot;Masipskoik&quot; which means &quot;where there is flint&quot;.

The Eastern Townships of Quebec were opened for settlement by the Constitutional Act of 1791. The first European settler in Potton township was Nicholas Austin. He was a Loyalist from Somersworth, New Hampshire who in 1791 settled at the site of present-day Perkins Landing. Due to a navigation error, he moved, in 1793, north to Bolton Township to the land that was allocated to him. The town of Austin bears his name. Austin&#x27;s log house at Perkins Landing was assumed by Samuel Perkins in 1793. Other early settlers of Potton Township were David Blanchard, Col. Henry Ruiter, Moses Elkins, and the Perkins, Manson, Gilman, and Coit families. The names of the early settlers remain in the toponymy of the township: Ruiter&#x27;s Brook in Dunkin, Vale Perkins, Perkins Landing, Mansonville, and Knowlton&#x27;s Landing.

Potton Township was proclaimed on October 31, 1797. It, and the homonymous municipality township erected in 1845, derive their name from the town of Potton in England, located in Bedfordshire, near the village of Sutton.

Perkins Landing and Knowlton&#x27;s Landing were regular stops for the steamships that plied Lake Memphremagog from the latter half of the 19th century up to the mid-20th century. The first of these steamships was the &quot;Mountain Maid&quot;, the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; was the largest, and the last was the &quot;Anthemis&quot;. The wharves at these locations now provide public access to the lake.

Two lighthouses were located on the shore of Lake Memphremagog. They were built in 1878 and no longer exist.
*Chateau de Silva Lighthouse, located roughly midway between Knowlton&#x27;s Landing and Perkins Landing,
*Lead Mines Lighthouse, located near Leadville, at the foot of Mount Owl&#x27;s Head.

The covered bridge crossing Mud Creek was listed as a cultural heritage site in 2008. The bridge was built in 1896 and is of the &quot;Town Simple&quot; type.

A round barn, built in 1911 for Robert Jersey, is situated in Mansonville. The structure and site were listed as a cultural heritage site in 2009.

Highwater was the site of the Space Research Corporation where Gerald Bull performed ballistics research.

Portions of the 1998 movie &quot;Free Money&quot; were filmed in Vale Perkins, Highwater, Mansonville, and near Mount Owl&#x27;s Head.

Some exterior scenes for the third season of the Quebec police thriller &quot;La Faille&quot; (2022) were filmed in Mansonville on September 21 and 22, 2021. The town hall served as the site of the series town &quot;Applegrove&quot; police station. The closed Restaurant Soleil Rouge served as the series establishment &quot;Chez Karen&quot;. Other scenes were filmed on Rue des Pins, Rue Principale, and in Parc Mansonville. The episodes were aired in November 2022 on Club Illico.

==Geography==
The eastern boundary of the township is the western half of Lake Memphremagog. The southern boundary is the international border with the United States of America. The western boundary is formed by the Sutton Mountains.

The elevation of Lake Memphremagog is . The maximum recorded depth is , which is located north of Mount Owl&#x27;s Head and between Perkins Landing and Knowltons Landing, opposite Jewett Point (at approximately ).

The territory of the township is traversed by the north to south flow of the North Branch of the Missisquoi River. It confluences in Highwater with the South Branch of the Missisquoi River, forming the Missisquoi River which disembogues into Lake Champlain at Missisquoi Bay.

The township is dotted with many mountains. Among the more prominent peaks are:
*Peewee, with a height of and located at 
*Elephantis (also called Elephantus), with a height of and located at 
*Hog&#x27;s Back, with a height of and located at 
*Owl&#x27;s Head, with a height of and located at 
*Hawk, with a height of and located at 
*Bear, with a height of and located at 

Potton is well known for the many sugar bushes that produce maple syrup, considered among the most remarkable in the Quebec.

==Geology and soils==

Most of the bedrock underlying the township is Cambrian-era slate, schist, phyllite, greywacke and quartzite. There are bands of ultramafic rock near the Missisquoi River valley, and basalt also occurs. Quaternary glaciation left deposits of stony loam till plus outwash deposits of sand and gravel. Benchlands overlooking the Missisquoi River commonly have deposits of clay loam. Brown podzolic and podzol profile developments are most common.

The area is also rich in talc. For many years the Baker Talc company operated underground mining and open-pit operations in South Bolton, with a plant in Highwater. The mine and plant are inactive.

Other inactive mines include a copper mine on the northwestern slope of Hog&#x27;s Back and a lead mine in Leadville.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Potton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="1071082" wikidata="Q700339" url="?curid=1071082" title="SS Bremen (1928)">
<text>SS &quot;Bremen&quot; was a German-built ocean liner constructed for the German shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) to work the transatlantic sea route. Launched in 1928, &quot;Bremen&quot; was notable for her high-speed engines and low, streamlined profile. At the time of her construction, she and her sister ship were the two most advanced high-speed steam turbine ocean liners of their day. The German pair sparked an international competition in the building of large, fast, luxurious ocean liners that were national symbols and points of prestige during the pre-war years of the 1930s. She held the Blue Riband, and was the fourth ship of NDL to carry the name &quot;Bremen&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Bremen&quot; and her sister were designed to have a cruising speed of , allowing a crossing time of five days. This speed enabled Norddeutscher Lloyd to run regular weekly crossings with two ships, a feat that normally required three. It was claimed that &quot;Bremen&quot; briefly reached speeds of during her sea trials.

===Design and construction===
&quot;Bremen&quot; was built by the new German shipbuilding company Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau. She was built from 7,000 tons of high-strength steel of 52 kg/m2 (500 N/m2), allowing a weight saving of some 800 tons on the structure. She was also the first commercial ship to be designed with the Taylor bulbous bow, though bulbous bows of different types had appeared on earlier merchant vessels, such as of 1926. She was launched at Bremen during the afternoon of Thursday, 16 August 1928 by President Paul von Hindenburg, only one day after the launch of her sister ship at Hamburg. SS &quot;Bremen&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Europa&quot; were considered for their time as the most modern liners in the world. The high speeds and the comfort and luxury level on board made high demands of technical personnel. Each ship required an engineering crew of some 170 men.

As on her sister ship &quot;Europa&quot;, &quot;Bremen&quot; had a catapult on the upper deck between the two funnels with a small seaplane, which facilitated faster mail service. The airplane was launched from the ship several hours before arrival, landing at the seaplane base in Blexen.

The boiler and the machine equipment were designed by Professor Dr. Gustav Bauer. &quot;Bremen&quot; had four airtight boiler rooms. The combustion air for the oil burners of the boilers was blown into the boiler rooms by eight steam turbine blowers. The resulting positive pressure meant that the boiler rooms were accessible only through airlocks. The steam was generated in 20 oil-fired water tube boilers, eleven double-enders and nine single-enders in four banks fired by a total of 227 oil burners. The operating pressure was 23 atm = 24 bar with a steam temperature at the superheater discharge of . The maximum steam generating capacity was 500 tons/h. For harbour operation three boilers with their own blower were available, so that during work periods the main boiler airlocks could remain open. The total heating surface amounted to , the superheater surface and the air preheater surface . The feed water was preheated to and the fuel oil consumption was 33 tons/h or 380 g/HP/h or 800 tons/day, fed from oil bunkers with a capacity of 7,552 tons.

SS &quot;Bremen&quot; had four geared steam turbines that could generate approximately . Each of them had a high pressure, a medium pressure, low pressure and a reverse turbine. In reverse, 65% of the forward power was available. At cruise speed the turbines made 1800 rpm while the propellers made 180 rpm for a power output of . The four propellers were bronze and had a diameter of , pitch of and weighed 17 tons each. The 230 V electric power on the ship came from four diesel generators with a total output of 520 kW. On board, there were total of 420 electric motors, approximately 21,000 lamps, electric cookers and 20 elevators.

===Blue Riband===
&quot;Bremen&quot; was to have made her maiden transatlantic crossing in the company of her sister &quot;Europa&quot;, but &quot;Europa&quot; suffered a serious fire during fitting-out, so &quot;Bremen&quot; crossed solo, departing Bremerhaven for New York City under the command of Commodore Leopold Ziegenbein on 16 July 1929. She arrived four days, 17 hours, and 42 minutes later, capturing the westbound Blue Riband from with an average speed of .

This voyage also marked the first time mail was carried by a ship-launched plane for delivery before the ship&#x27;s arrival. A Heinkel HE 12 floatplane, flown by 27-year-old Luft Hansa pilot Baron Jobst von Studnitz, was launched at sea twenty miles east of Fire Island with 11,000 pieces of mail in six mailbags weighing which it delivered to New York many hours before the ship docked at the North German-Lloyd pier at the foot of 58th Street in Brooklyn. On the return passage to Germany &quot;Bremen&quot; took the eastbound Blue Riband with a time of 4 days 14 hours and 30 minutes and an average speed of , the first time a liner had broken two records on her first two passages. The mailplane was launched on the eastbound voyage in the English Channel near Cherbourg carrying 18,000 letters to Bremerhaven where it delivered the mail many hours ahead of the ship&#x27;s arrival. &quot;Bremen&quot; lost the westbound Blue Riband to her sister &quot;Europa&quot; in 1930, and the eastbound Blue Riband to Italian in 1932.

===Before World War II===
As Nazism gained power in Germany, &quot;Bremen&quot; and her pier in New York were often the site of Anti-Nazi demonstrations. On 26 July 1935 a group of anti-Nazi demonstrators, later dubbed &quot;The Bremen Six&quot;, boarded &quot;Bremen&quot; just before she sailed and tore the Nazi flag from the jackstaff and tossed it into the Hudson River. At the time there was a dual flag law, by which both the black-white-red horizontal tricolor (previously the flag of the German Empire), and the swastika flag were simultaneously official national flags of Germany. As the ship&#x27;s swastika flag was the one tossed into the river, US authorities claimed that no symbol of Germany had been harmed.
On 15 September 1935 Germany changed its flag law, removing the status of the black-white-red flag of imperial Germany, lest it be used by reactionaries. The Nazis on coming to power had used it as a co-national flag to replace the black-red-gold flag of the Weimar Republic.

&quot;Bremen&quot; started her South America cruise on 11 February 1939, and was the first ship of this size to traverse the Panama Canal. On 22 August 1939, she began her last voyage to New York. After ten years of service, she had almost 190 transatlantic voyages completed.

===World War II===

On 26 August 1939, in anticipation of the invasion of Poland, the Kriegsmarine high command ordered all German merchant ships to head to German ports immediately. &quot;Bremen&quot; was on a westbound crossing and two days from New York when she received the order. &quot;Bremen&quot;″s captain decided to continue to New York to disembark her 1,770 passengers. She left New York without passengers on 30 August 1939 and on 1 September, coincident with the start of the Second World War, she was ordered to make for the Russian port of Murmansk. Underway, her crew painted the ship grey for camouflage. She made use of bad weather and high speed to avoid Royal Navy cruisers, arriving in Murmansk on 6 September 1939. With the outbreak of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, on 10 December 1939 &quot;Bremen&quot; made a dash to Bremerhaven, arriving on 13 December. On the way she was sighted and challenged by the S-class submarine . A Dornier Do 18 seaplane escorting &quot;Bremen&quot; forced &quot;Salmon&quot; to dive for safety. &quot;Salmon&quot;″s commander, Lieutenant Commander E. O. Bickford, decided not to torpedo the liner because he believed she was not a legal target. His decision not to fire on &quot;Bremen&quot; likely delayed the start of unrestricted submarine warfare.

&quot;Bremen&quot; was used as a barracks ship; there were plans to use her as a transport in Operation Sea Lion, the intended invasion of Great Britain.

==Fate==

On 16 March 1941, &quot;Bremen&quot; was set alight by 14-year-old crew member Walter Schmidt while at her dock in Bremerhaven and completely gutted. A lengthy investigation discovered that the arson resulted from revenge stemming from a ship&#x27;s officer who had punished him for not completing his assignment, not an act of war. Schmidt was later guillotined for the arson, becoming one of the youngest people to be judicially executed by the regime at age 15. 

Starting in 1942 she was dismantled to the waterline so the steel could be used for munitions. In 1946 her remains were towed up the River Weser, beached on a sandbar off Blexen, Nordenham and destroyed by explosives, though some parts of the double hull remained as of 2012.

==Legacy==
In 2004, a stamp was issued showing &quot; Bremen &quot; before the Manhattan skyline.

In 2003, Radio Bremen produced a one-hour radio feature, &quot;Königin der Meere – Die Geschichte des Schnelldampfers &quot;Bremen&quot;&quot; (&quot;Queen of the Seas - The story of the rapid steamer &quot;Bremen&quot;&quot;) by Detlef Michelers and other former sailors on &quot;Bremen&quot;.

In the stairwell in the Übersee Museum Bremen, there is a 1:100 scale model of &quot;Bremen&quot;, while in the shipping exhibit there is a model of her significantly smaller earlier namesake to the same scale.

A much larger, 39-foot long model of the &quot;Bremen&quot;, known officially as &quot;Bremen IV, Junior,&quot; was built between 1949 and 1962 by enthusiasts Günter Bos and Günter Buse. The 10-ton model, operated by a two-person crew inside, would tour the world, and achieve a Guinness World Record for largest seaworthy model ship. It currently resides at Technik Museum Speyer.

<text>San Martiño (&quot;Saint Martin&quot;) is a small island off the north coast of Galician, Spain, at the mouth of the Sor river and the beginning of &quot;Ría&quot; (estuary) of O Barqueiro.

It is formed from a meander of the Sor river.

The island belongs to the parish of As Negradas, municipality of O Vicedo.

==History==

The island had a Celtic settlement (Castro) on the hill in the middle of the island. This settlement is called &quot;Cova dos Mouros&quot; by the local people.

During the Middle Ages there was a Benedictine convent that lasted until the 15th century, Maria Vizoso being its last prioress.

It was a fertile, well-cultivated soil. Nowadays it is the island with the most forest mass (eucalyptus) in all of Europe.</text><links>

<text>The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) is a high-precision echelle planet-finding spectrograph installed in 2002 on the ESO&#x27;s 3.6m telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. The first light was achieved in February 2003. HARPS has discovered over 130 exoplanets to date, with the first one in 2004, making it the most successful planet finder behind the Kepler space telescope. It is a second-generation radial-velocity spectrograph, based on experience with the ELODIE and CORALIE instruments.

==Characteristics==
The HARPS can attain a precision of 0.97 m/s (3.5 km/h), making it one of only two instruments worldwide with such accuracy. This is due to a design in which the target star and a reference spectrum from a thorium lamp are observed simultaneously using two identical optic fibre feeds, and to careful attention to mechanical stability: the instrument sits in a vacuum vessel which is temperature-controlled to within 0.01 kelvins. The precision and sensitivity of the instrument is such that it incidentally produced the best available measurement of the thorium spectrum. Planet-detection is in some cases limited by the seismic pulsations of the star observed rather than by limitations of the instrument.

The principal investigator on the HARPS is Michel Mayor who, along with Didier Queloz and Stéphane Udry, have used the instrument to characterize the Gliese 581 planetary system, home to one of the smallest known exoplanets orbiting a normal star, and two super-Earths whose orbits lie in the star&#x27;s habitable zone.

It was initially used for a survey of one-thousand stars.

Since October 2012 the HARPS spectrograph has the precision to detect a new category of planets: habitable super-Earths. This sensitivity was expected from simulations of stellar intrinsic signals, and actual observations of planetary systems. Currently, the HARPS can detect habitable super-Earth only around low-mass stars as these are more affected by gravitational tug from planets and have habitable zones close to the host star.

== Discoveries ==
This is an incomplete list of exoplanets discovered by the HARPS. The list is sorted by the date of the discovery&#x27;s announcement. As of December 2017, the list contains 134 exoplanets.
