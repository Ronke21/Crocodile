<text>Timothy Richard Goebel (born September 10, 1980) is an American former competitive figure skater. He is the 2002 Olympic bronze medalist. He was the first person to land a quadruple salchow jump in competition and the first person to land three quadruple jumps in one program. He landed 76 career quadruple jumps before his retirement in 2006.

==Personal life==
Goebel was born on September 10, 1980, in Evanston, Illinois. He was adopted through Catholic Charities by Ginny and Richard Goebel as an infant.

Goebel initially attended Loyola Marymount University. Beginning in the fall of 2006, he studied at Columbia University&#x27;s School of General Studies, graduating in May 2010 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. After working for the Nielsen ratings company, he joined an ad agency, MEC, as a consumer analyst. As of April 2016, he was pursuing a master&#x27;s degree in data science from New York University Stern School of Business. In January 2017, he began working as a data analyst for Google.

In April 2016, Goebel became engaged to his boyfriend of three years, Thomas Luciano. They married on April 29, 2017, in Newport, Rhode Island.

== Career ==
Early in his career, Goebel was coached by Carol Heiss Jenkins and Glyn Watts near his Illinois home and then moved to California to work with Frank Carroll.

During his skating career and prior to the arrival of Nathan Chen to the sport, Goebel was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Quad King&quot; because of his ability to land quadruple jumps. On March 7, 1998, in Lausanne, Switzerland, at the Junior Grand Prix Final, Goebel became the first skater in the world to land a quadruple Salchow, and the first American skater to land a quadruple jump of any kind in competition. International Skating Union officials ratified the jump at the end of the month after watching a video provided by the parents of Tiffany Stiegler / Johnnie Stiegler.

On October 31, 1999, at the 1999 Skate America in Colorado Springs, Goebel became the first skater to land three quads in one program. In the free skate, he landed a quad salchow in combination, a quad toe loop, and a quad salchow as a solo jump.

Goebel also made history at the 2002 Olympics by becoming the first skater to successfully land a quad Salchow in combination in Olympic competition. Goebel&#x27;s repertoire of quadruple jumps made him one of the most competitive skaters in the world during the peak of his career. He would land a total of 76 quads in competition. Goebel was heavily criticized early in his career for focusing exclusively on jumping to the detriment of choreography and presentation, but in later years he improved in those areas.

Goebel increasingly struggled with his jumps after 2003 due to injuries. At the 2006 U.S. Championships, in what he had previously announced would be his last competitive season, he was unable to land either a quadruple jump or triple Axel cleanly, and dropped to a seventh-place finish which left him far short of qualifying for the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Goebel represented the Winterhurst Figure Skating Club. He was coached by Audrey Weisiger in Fairfax, Virginia, after having been previously coached by Carol Heiss Jenkins, Glyn Watts and Frank Carroll.

On April 25, 2006, Goebel announced his retirement from competitive skating. He planned to continue to contribute to the sport as a technical specialist, having received certification for competitions sanctioned by the United States Figure Skating Association. He worked as a technical specialist at the Aviator Figure Skating Academy in New York.

He attended Columbia University, graduating in 2010 with a degree in mathematics. In 2016, he received a Master of Science in Business Analytics degree from New York University Stern School of Business, and currently works for Google as a Marketing Mix Modeling Partner Program Manager.

<text>Nathan Paul Cullen (born July 13, 1972) is a Canadian politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia (MLA) representing the riding of Stikine from 2020 to 2024 as a member of the New Democratic Party and served in the Executive Council of British Columbia from 2020 to 2024. 

Prior to entering provincial politics, Cullen served federally as a member of Parliament (MP) representing the riding of Skeena—Bulkley Valley from 2004 to 2019. He stood in the 2012 New Democratic Party leadership election, where he came in third. During the 41st Parliament, Cullen was the House Leader for the Official Opposition and then Finance critic in Thomas Mulcair&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet. 

== Early life ==
Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Cullen worked in several countries in Central and South America, during the 1990s, on community economic development projects. Cullen has described himself as a descendant of Jewish people. He moved to Smithers, British Columbia in 1998 and started a private consulting business focussed on strategic planning and conflict resolution. While working in Latin America, Cullen learned Spanish and named his company Maravilla Consultants after the town (the Spanish word for &quot;wonder&quot;) in Costa Rica in which he worked.

Cullen completed high school at Martingrove Collegiate Institute in Toronto, and graduated from Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario in 1994, with a bachelor of arts (honours) in international development studies and environmental studies.

== Federal politics ==

=== 38th Parliament ===
At the age of 31, in the June 2004 federal election, Cullen was elected to his first term as a Member of Parliament. He had won the NDP nomination in the Skeena—Bulkley Valley riding three months earlier against a Prince Rupert social worker. In the general election, he challenged the Conservative incumbent Andy Burton, Liberal Miles Richardson who was chair of the BC
 Treaty Commission, Rod Taylor of the Christian Heritage Party, engineer and photographer Roger Benham of the Green Party and Marxist-Leninist Frank Martin. The election was seen as a tight three-way race between Burton, Richardson, and Cullen. Cullen made support of the federal moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling part of his campaign and a magnitude 6.7 earthquake off Haida Gwaii during the campaign helped highlight Cullen&#x27;s arguments. Cullen went on to defeat the Conservative incumbent Burton by a margin of 1,272 votes. Cullen was the youngest of 19 New Democratic Party candidates elected to the 38th Parliament.

He became the party&#x27;s national critic for youth issues, the environment and national parks. He continued to support the moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling despite Prime-Minister Paul Martin opening a cabinet level review of the moratorium; the review ended with the conclusion that lifting the moratorium was too politically divisive.

By the end of 2004, he was voted &quot;Favourite Up-and-Comer Rookie Politician&quot; by fellow Members of Parliament. He was also awarded the US Ambassador&#x27;s Award as one of only two Canadian recipients. In the first half of 2005, Cullen toured western provinces with other MPs to promote a private member&#x27;s bill (Bill C-261) which would lower the voting age to 16. In February he made a motion in the House of Commons to &quot;recognize the public health impacts of smog&quot; and require improved emission standards of light duty vehicles sold in Canada, though it was not supported by the Liberal Party or Conservative Party. In the fall, Cullen challenged the Minister of the Environment Stéphane Dion to take a blood test to illustrate the level of toxins present in the environment. He also spent time lobbying the Liberal government to publicly disclose the bids for Ridley Terminal; the proposed sale of the Prince Rupert Port Authority coal loading terminals by the federal government to a private firm was criticized by opposition parties as undervaluing the facility and likely to restrict fair access by competing coal companies. The sale was ultimately blocked by the Conservative Party after they won the subsequent election.

=== 39th Parliament ===
In the 2006 election, Cullen faced a strong challenge from the Conservative Party candidate and former MP Mike Scott (who had represented Skeena from 1993 to 2000). Scott ran an aggressive campaign attacking the Liberal candidate, filing a request with Elections Canada for an investigation into Cullen&#x27;s campaign finances, and using signage saying &quot;Re-elect Scott&quot;, despite the fact that Cullen was the incumbent. Cullen was effective at forcing Scott to defend issues from his time in office during the 1990s while Scott made Cullen defend his vote to support the Canadian Firearms Registry despite promising to vote against it. Cullen went on to win by an unexpectedly large margin, 15%, over Scott.

In April 2006, Cullen introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill (&quot;Phthalate Control Act&quot; Bill C-307) to ban phthalates, a chemical in many plastics, from products intended for infants and toddlers. The bill passed through all stages in the House of Commons but died on the order paper in the Senate when the 39th Parliament was dissolved. The proposal was subsequently adopted by Government and in June 2009 new regulations were introduced to place restrictions on six phthalates.

As Environment Critic for the NDP, Cullen sat on the committee that largely re-wrote the Government&#x27;s Clean Air Act (C-30). The new act was called the &quot;Clean Air and Climate Change Act&quot; (Bill C-468). The Government refused to reintroduce the bill after Cullen&#x27;s revisions and the act died on the order paper in the House.

=== 40th Parliament ===
Following the 2008 election, Cullen was named the New Democrat Critic for Natural Resources and Energy. In this role he chaired the NDP&#x27;s Green Economy Taskforce, working on ways to help create employment while meeting our responsibilities to the planet&#x27;s future generations and promoted sustainable energy development through a study of Canada&#x27;s Energy Security at the House of Commons Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Cullen also led an NDP effort to secure a bulk oil tanker ban on the north coast of British Columbia which led to the passage in the House of Commons of a motion calling for such a ban by a close vote of 143–138.

In 2009 Cullen created a contest in his constituency called Create Your Canada which challenges students between grades 5 and 12 to submit proposals for federal legislation. Two winners are picked each year and are flown to Ottawa to watch their submissions introduced in the House of Commons as private member&#x27;s bills. In 2009, two bills were introduced: Bill C-399, which proposed a ban on the mining and export of asbestos; and Bill C-400, which encouraged the Government of Canada to support the development of cycling friendly infrastructure.

=== 41st Parliament ===
In 2011, Cullen was elected for a fourth term with 55% of all votes cast— the highest plurality in the riding since 1962. In the 41st Parliament, Cullen served as Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Privacy, Access to Information and Ethics. He was also the Associate Critic for Natural Resources, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, and Environment and Sustainable Development before resigning from his roles to participate in the NDP leadership race. The 2013 &quot;Hill Times&quot; Annual Most Valuable Politician &amp; All Politics Poll awarded Cullen 3rd place in the &quot;Best Up-and-comer MP&quot; category, tied with Elizabeth May.

==== NDP leadership race ====
Following the death of party leader Jack Layton, the NDP began a leadership race. Cullen announced his official candidacy on September 30, 2011. In his opening speech, Cullen stated his vision for a new and progressive kind of politics, saying &quot;now&#x27;s the time for an honest discussion about the direction our politics is going in...and how we must change it for the better.&quot; Cullen also argued the choice between the economy and the environment is unnecessary, but that a green economy is a balance between creating jobs and protecting the environment. He cast himself as a pro-business candidate.

Cullen proposed that joint primary nominations should take place in Conservative-held ridings to determine the best possible local candidate to avoid vote splitting among &#x27;progressives&#x27;. Cullen is suggesting that each constituency association would have the choice of whether or not to run their respective campaign in this way, and that there would be no &quot;top-down&quot; directive to do so. In his policy papers thus far, Cullen has also advanced a number of other ideas such as: creating a national public transit strategy, instituting carbon cap-and-trade pricing, putting a moratorium on new genetically modified organisms, redefining the Canadian Wheat Board, and holding a referendum on voting reform (Cullen supports mixed-member proportional representation as currently used in New Zealand and Germany).

Observers and commentators noted that Cullen&#x27;s performances in the debates increased his profile. Whereas at the beginning of the race Cullen was considered one of the &quot;also-rans&quot;, he eventually was given considerably more attention, with the CBC, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and &quot;National Post&quot; all running articles on his candidacy.

On the day of the convention, Cullen surprised many by placing third in the first round of voting with 16% of the vote, behind with Thomas Mulcair and Brian Topp in first and second respectively (30% for Mulcair, 21% for Topp). He continued to hold third place after the second and third counts, eventually being eliminated at the third count with 24.6% of the votes (Mulcair had 43% of the vote, Topp had 31%). He declined to endorse another candidate.

==== House Leader for the Official Opposition ====

On April 20, 2012 Cullen was named House Leader for the Official Opposition in Thomas Mulcair&#x27;s first Shadow Cabinet Shuffle. Cullen replaced long time Ontario MP Joe Comartin as House Leader, with Comartin being named Critic for Democratic Reform.

==== Finance Critic for the Official Opposition ====
On March 20, 2014, Cullen replaced Peggy Nash as Finance Critic for the Official Opposition just days after former Natural Resources minister Joe Oliver was named Minister of Finance. Upon taking up the post, Cullen emphasized his previous occupation as a small business owner in northern British Columbia against Oliver&#x27;s previous career as a Merrill Lynch executive and promised to bring a &quot;Main Street&quot; perspective to challenge Oliver&#x27;s &quot;Bay Street&quot; background. In March 2015, Cullen attacked Joe Oliver over his avoidance of Question Period after repeated delays in introducing the budget after the drop in oil prices.

On September 23, 2014, Cullen tabled Bill C-628 (short-titled An Act to Defend the Pacific Northwest) in the House of Commons, which would ban supertankers from the Queen Charlotte Sound, the Hecate Strait and the Dixon Entrance, as well as modify the &quot;National Energy Board Act&quot; to require any pipeline review to take into account the impact of any proposal on employment in the refining and upgrading sectors, and require the National Energy Board to deepen its consultations with communities and First Nations. The bill was a response to the National Energy Board&#x27;s approval of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline.

As part of the &quot;Take Back Our Coast&quot; campaign, Cullen toured dozens of communities around British Columbia&#x27;s north, interior, lower mainland and across Vancouver Island promoting Bill C-628 and raising awareness about the potential impacts of a pipeline or supertanker spill from Northern Gateway on fisheries, tourism and communities. On April 1, 2015, the bill came to a vote at second reading in the House of Commons, and was defeated by a count of 141–120, with all government MPs voting against.

On November 22, 2014, Cullen was named Most Knowledgeable Parliamentarian at the Maclean&#x27;s Magazine Parliamentarian of the Year Awards in Ottawa, edging out Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who placed second in votes.

===42nd Parliament===
After the 2015 election, Cullen was appointed the NDP critic for Environment and Climate Change and Democratic Reform in the 42nd Parliament.

As critic for Democratic Institutions, Cullen took the lead in criticizing the government&#x27;s plans for electoral reform, and in particular for the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. The government ultimately reversed course, and instead backed Cullen&#x27;s motion for the composition of the committee. Cullen was subsequently named to the committee, and serves as vice-chair.

Cullen announced on March 1, 2019, that he would not run for re-election in that year&#x27;s federal election.

==Provincial politics==
On January 27, 2020, Cullen was appointed by the Government of British Columbia as the liaison between the province and the Wetʼsuwetʼen hereditary chiefs. Cullen&#x27;s appointment came in the midst of the 2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests, after the hereditary chiefs refused to meet with BC Minister of Indigenous Relations Scott Fraser.

In the lead up to the 2020 British Columbia general election, Cullen announced his intention to seek the nomination for the BC NDP in the riding of Stikine, essentially the northern portion of his federal riding. His candidacy became the subject of controversy when he was acclaimed by the party one week after Annita McPhee, a former elected president of the Tahltan Nation, announced she was seeking the nomination for the riding. The BC NDP has an equity policy whereby a male MLA has to be replaced by a member of an equity-seeking group, such as a woman or a First Nations person, when he retires. The party claimed that McPhee&#x27;s application contained invalid signatures, and that the local riding association conducted a search for candidates to meet its equity policy but none were willing to stand. McPhee asked Nathan Cullen to step down to from seeking the nomination for that riding because of the party&#x27;s equity policy but Cullen refused. Despite the controversy, Cullen was elected with 51.7% of the vote.

On November 26, 2020, Cullen was sworn in to the Executive Council of British Columbia as Minister of State for Lands and Resource Operations. On February 25, 2022 he was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs. He was subsequently named Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship and Minister Responsible for Fisheries in the Eby ministry on December 7, 2022.

In the 2024 British Columbia general election, he was unseated by Sharon Hartwell from the Conservative Party of British Columbia.

==Personal life==
Nathan Cullen and Diana Dahr met in Smithers through their work with Katimavik, and they were engaged by the end of 2004. On August 6, 2010, they became parents of twin boys at Mills Memorial Hospital.

<text>The 2001–02 NHL season was the 85th regular season of the National Hockey League. Thirty teams competed in an 82-game regular season. The regular season began on October 3, and the playoffs concluded on June 13, with the Detroit Red Wings defeating the Carolina Hurricanes in the Stanley Cup Finals in five games, winning their tenth Stanley Cup in franchise history.

==League business==
===Pittsburgh financial troubles===
The cash-strapped Pittsburgh Penguins, desperate to dump payroll, could no longer afford perennial superstar Jaromir Jagr. He would be traded, along with Frantisek Kucera, to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Kris Beech, Ross Lupaschuk, Michal Sivek, and $4.9 million. Despite Mario Lemieux&#x27;s return the previous season, the absence of Jagr proved devastating to the Penguins, and they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1990. The Penguins did not return to the playoffs until after they drafted Sidney Crosby in 2005.

===Entry draft===
The 2001 NHL Entry Draft was held on June 23 and 24, 2001 at the National Car Rental Center in Sunrise, Florida. Ilya Kovalchuk was selected first overall by the Atlanta Thrashers.

===Preseason game in Europe===
As part of the NHL Challenge, the Colorado Avalanche played a preseason game against Swedish team Brynäs Gävle on September 16, 2001 at Stockholm Globe Arena in Stockholm.

==Remembrances of September 11, 2001, attacks==
The 2001–02 regular season began less than one month after the September 11 attacks. The NHL honored the victims by having all players wear a patch on their jerseys, and a ribbon sticker on the back of their helmet. Red, white, and blue ribbons were painted on the ice behind each net at American arenas, and red and white ribbons were painted behind the nets at Canadian arenas. On September 20, 2001, in the middle of a pre-season game between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers with both teams tied up 2–2, nine days after the attacks, the game was stopped so that a national television address by U.S. President George W. Bush about the September 11 attacks could be broadcast on the arena video screen. After the end of the television address, the game did not resume and was declared a 2–2 tie.

==Uniform changes==
*Buffalo Sabres: In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Sabres, in a sign of solidarity, took to the ice at Madison Square Garden on October 7 wearing jerseys reading &quot;New York&quot; on the front. Like the New York Rangers, their opponents in that game, the Sabres, play their home games in the state of New York.
*Colorado Avalanche: The Avalanche introduce a third jersey, with a burgundy base and the word &quot;Colorado&quot; slanted across the front of the jersey.
*Columbus Blue Jackets: The numbers become more narrow and the names on the back shrink slightly.
*Edmonton Oilers: The team introduces an alternate jersey, featuring silver in place of bronze and red. The crest is their new alternate logo with an oil bolt with 5 rivets, representing the team&#x27;s 5 Stanley Cup titles.
*Los Angeles Kings: The Kings wore two patches. On the upper right chest was the All-Star Game patch, as the Kings were the hosts of the 2002 All-Star Game. On the upper left chest is a patch with the letters &quot;AM,&quot; for director of scouting Garnet &quot;Ace&quot; Bailey and scout Mark Bavis, who were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 175 in the September 11 attacks.
*Nashville Predators: The Predators unveil their first alternate jersey in team history, with the base a mustard yellow compared to their usual shade of gold used in the trimmings of their home and away jerseys. It also uses the team&#x27;s front-facing sabre-tooth tiger head logo.
*New York Rangers: In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Rangers wore ribbons on their uniforms in memory of the victims. Also in their October 7 game at Madison Square Garden against the Buffalo Sabres, both teams wore &quot;New York&quot; on their jerseys. For the Rangers, it was a return of sorts to the blue jerseys they wore from 1978 to 1987.
*Ottawa Senators: The Senators wore special stickers on their helmets marking their 10th season in the NHL.
*Philadelphia Flyers: The orange jersey is retired, leaving the black jersey to be worn on the road full time. However, they did wear the orange jersey once on Halloween night. The jerseys brought good luck to the Flyers that night, as they shut out the Pittsburgh Penguins, 3–0. In a show of support for New York&#x27;s finest and bravest, the Flyers wore three special patches at the bottom of the back of the jersey. From left to right, they were &quot;FDNY,&quot; the American flag, and &quot;NYPD.&quot; The jerseys were auctioned off after the game to benefit the NHL&#x27;s Twin Towers fund.
*San Jose Sharks: The Sharks introduce a new black alternate jersey, with minimal striping compared to their home and away jerseys and downplaying the use of teal.
*Tampa Bay Lightning: The team changes the font of their jerseys due to fan complaints deeming them unreadable. Also, the Lightning wore a patch to celebrate their 10th NHL season.
*Toronto Maple Leafs: In honor of the 75th anniversary of the St. Pats becoming the Maple Leafs, the team wears vintage St. Pats jerseys in their game against the Buffalo Sabres on March 2. During the rest of the season, they wore special stickers on their helmets celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Maple Leafs.
*Vancouver Canucks: A new alternate jersey is introduced, featuring a torso that changes from navy blue to maroon. The jersey features a redesigned Canuck Place patch.
*Washington Capitals: The Capitals wore a patch in memory of the victims of the September 11 attacks.

==Arena changes==
* The Dallas Stars moved from Reunion Arena to the American Airlines Center, with American Airlines acquiring the naming rights.
* The San Jose Sharks&#x27; home arena, San Jose Arena, was renamed the Compaq Center as part of new naming rights agreement with Compaq.

==Regular season==
===All-Star Game===
The All-Star Game was played on February 2, 2002, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the home of the Los Angeles Kings. It was the last NHL All-Star Game to have the North America vs. World All-Star format.

===Olympics===
The league took a break from its season between February 14 and February 25 to allow players to participate at the men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

===Death of Brittanie Cecil===
During the Calgary Flames–Columbus Blue Jackets game on March 16 at Nationwide Arena, 13-year old fan Brittanie Cecil was struck in head by a deflected puck. She died from her injuries two days later. As a result of the tragedy, the NHL made it mandatory the following season to install protective nets above the glass behind both goals.

===Scoring===
For the second time in three seasons, no player reached the 100-point plateau. In addition, for the first time since 1980, the Art Ross Trophy was not won by either Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, or Jaromir Jagr. Instead, the award went to Jarome Iginla, who scored 96 points.

===Final standings===
The Detroit Red Wings placed first in the league standings and received home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs.
This is the first season that the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers &quot;both&quot; missed the playoffs.

==Playoffs==

===Bracket===
In each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team played at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top eight teams in each conference made the playoffs, with the three division winners seeded 1–3 based on regular season record, and the five remaining teams seeded 4–8.

The NHL used &quot;re-seeding&quot; instead of a fixed bracket playoff system. During the first three rounds, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed, the second-highest remaining seed played the second-lowest remaining seed, and so forth. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. The two conference winners then advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where home ice advantage was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.

==Awards==
The NHL Awards presentation took place in Toronto.

==Broadcasting==
===Canada===
This was the fourth and final season of the league&#x27;s Canadian national broadcast rights deals with CBC and Sportsnet. CBC aired Saturday night &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; regular season games, while Sportsnet&#x27;s telecasts included &quot;Tuesday Night Hockey&quot; and other weeknight games. Coverage of the Stanley Cup playoffs continued to primarily be on CBC, while Sportsnet aired first round all-U.S. series.

The league would then sign a multi-year deal with Sportsnet&#x27;s rival TSN.

===United States===
This was the third year of the league&#x27;s five-year U.S. national broadcast rights deal with ESPN and ABC. ESPN and ESPN2 aired weeknight games throughout the regular season. ABC&#x27;s coverage included the All-Star Game and five weeks worth of regional games on Saturday afternoons in January and March. During the first two rounds of the playoffs, ESPN and ESPN2 aired selected games, while ABC had Saturday regional telecasts. Each U.S. team&#x27;s regional broadcaster produced local coverage of first and second round games (except for those games on ABC). ABC&#x27;s weekend telecasts continued into the Conference Finals, while ESPN had the rest of the third round games. ESPN then aired the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals before the rest of the series shifted to ABC.

<text>Luatangi Samurai Vatuvei (formerly Ruatangi Vatuvei) (born December 8, 1977) is a Tongan-born Japanese rugby union footballer.

Vatuvei played rugby in Japan for Toshiba Brave Lupus in the Top League and has also played for the Japan national rugby union team under the IRB three-year residence qualification.

Vatuvei is extremely strong, usually in the second row but also used by Toshiba coach Masahiro Kunda in the centres. In 2006, Vatuvei obtained Japanese citizenship.

In 2007, Vatuvei moved from Toshiba to Kintetsu Liners, which was demoted from the Top League in the previous season. This did not prevent John Kirwan from including him in the Japan squad for RWC 2007.

Vatuvei was the top try scorer in the 2004-5 Top League season with 18 tries. He is a cousin of New Zealand rugby league international winger Manu Vatuvei and an elder brother of Tonga rugby union international flanker Sione Vatuvei.

<text>Nottingham station, briefly known as Nottingham City and for rather longer as Nottingham Midland, is a railway station and tram stop in the city of Nottingham. It is the principal railway station of Nottingham. It is also a nodal point on the city&#x27;s tram system, with a tram stop that was originally called Station Street but is now known as Nottingham Station. It is the busiest station in Nottinghamshire, the busiest in the East Midlands, and the second busiest in the Midlands after Birmingham New Street.

The station was first built by the Midland Railway (MR) in 1848 and rebuilt by the same company in 1904, with much of the current building dating from the later date. It is now owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway (EMR). Besides EMR trains, it is also served by CrossCountry and Northern trains and by Nottingham Express Transit (NET) trams.

The station was one of several that once served the city of Nottingham. Amongst these were the city centre stations of on the Great Central Railway, and on the Great Northern Railway; both of these stations are now closed. A number of minor stations served localities outside the city centre, but the only such station to remain open within the city boundaries is .

==History==
===Early beginnings===
Nottingham&#x27;s first station was Carrington Street station, which opened in May 1839, when the Midland Counties Railway opened the line from Nottingham to Derby. This terminus station was situated on the opposite side of Carrington Street from the current station, on a site now occupied by Nottingham Magistrates&#x27; Court. The original station gate posts still exist and form the pedestrian entrance to the Magistrates&#x27; Courts area.


===The 1848 station===
In 1844, the Midland Counties Railway merged with two others into the Midland Railway. By 1848, the new company had outgrown Carrington Street station and new lines to Lincoln had been opened. A new through station was opened on the current station site on 22 May 1848, replacing the Carrington Street station. George Hall of Derby was the architect, and J.C. Hall of Nottingham the contractor and it had its entrance on Station Street. During 1869, the Midland Railway purchased the West Croft Canal arm, filling it and building additional parallel tracks to south.

During the 1880s, Nottingham station employed 170 staff. Although attractive when it first opened, by the early 20th century the station was quite cramped, having only three platforms.

On 18 August 1896, a light engine, running tender first, was passing through the station when it collided with six empty fish trucks. One of the trucks was thrown off the rails against a cast-iron column supporting the inner ends of the principals of the station roof and, when the column broke, a portion of the roof, measuring about by , fell onto the platforms and track. Six people on the platform were injured.

===The 1904 station===
When the Great Central Railway opened its Nottingham Victoria Station in 1900, the Midland Railway appointed Albert Edward Lambert, a local Nottingham architect, to rebuild the Midland station. Lambert had been the architect for Great Central&#x27;s station and, consequently, the two buildings had many similarities in their design. The station was rebuilt largely on the same site as the Station Street station, but the entrance was relocated onto Carrington Street.

The first contract for the station buildings was awarded to Edward Wood and Sons of Derby on 23 January 1903, who were also awarded the contract for the buildings on platforms 1 and 2 on 16 September 1903. The contract for the buildings on platforms 4 and 5 was awarded to Kirk, Knight &amp; Co of Sleaford on 18 June 1903, who were also responsible for building the parcels office (Forward House) on Station Street, which opened in November 1903. The structural steelwork and cast-ironwork was done by Handyside &amp; Co. and the Phoenix Foundry, both of Derby.

The station was built in an Edwardian Baroque Revival style at a cost of £1 million (£ million in ) and was described by the &quot;Nottingham Evening News&quot; on the eve of its opening (16 January 1904) as a &quot;magnificent new block of buildings&quot;. The building used a mix of red brick, terracotta (used as a substitute for building stone) and faience (a glazed terracotta), with slate and glazed pitch roofs over the principal buildings. The carriage entrances have Art Nouveau wrought-iron gates.

The station&#x27;s forebuildings were opened to passengers without any formal ceremony on 17 January 1904, although next day the &quot;Evening News&quot; reported that the platforms were still in a state of chaos and were not expected to be ready for another nine months. However, it did note that &quot;the result promises to be the provision for Nottingham of one of the most commodious and most convenient passenger stations in the country&quot;. The day began with the closure of the booking offices in the old station, after the last tickets were issued for the 5:25 a.m. London train and the new booking offices were opened in time to issue tickets for the 6:25 a.m. Erewash Valley train. No attempt was made to exclude the public from the building and many took the opportunity to view the new station buildings. The &quot;Evening News&quot; commented on the public&#x27;s admiration of the style and elegance of the station approaches and booking hall; it went on to describe the day&#x27;s events.

===20th century===
The station became the property of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, under the railway grouping of 1923. On Sunday 2 July 1939, the station was targeted by the Irish Republican Army in an attack on eight stations in the Midlands under their S-Plan; the others being Leicester, Derby, Birmingham, Stoke, Coventry, Leamington Spa and Stafford. A bomb was left in a suitcase and exploded at 6:30 a.m. The glass roof of the cloak room and enquiry office was blown away.

The station was nationalised in 1948, under the Transport Act 1947, becoming part of British Railways. Following the privatisation of the railways in the 1990s, ownership was transferred to Railtrack and subsequently to Network Rail.

For many years, the Midland Railway suffered the indignity of its rival, the Great Central Railway, crossing above the station on a bowstring girder bridge. This bridge became redundant in 1973 and was finally dismantled in the early 1980s. The alignment was later used for a new tramway bridge.

===Station Street tram stop===

With the opening of the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) in March 2004, Nottingham station became the southern terminus of the new tram line. The actual tram stop was located on Station Street, directly north of Nottingham railway station and partially over the Nottingham Canal. It was constructed on a separate right-of-way, built on top of part of the old Great Central Main Line viaduct that used to lead northwards to the separate Nottingham Victoria railway station. North of the former stop, the tram route diverged from the old railway route to join an on-street section through the centre of Nottingham. To the south, the route ended at the end of the viaduct, where a since demolished bridge used to carry the Great Central line over the station. In 2012, work started to extend Nottingham Express Transit south towards Toton Lane and Clifton South.

The tram stop itself was substantial, with a small station building containing a waiting area housing steps and a lift to reach the street below. There was also a short footbridge over Station Street, which connected to the main railway station. Up to three trams could be accommodated on the two platform faces; the western platform had a single-length platform, while the eastern platform was an extended double-length platform.

===Redevelopment===
Plans for a multi-million pound refurbishment and redevelopment of the station were unveiled by junior government minister Norman Baker on 5 October 2010. Under the scheme, the station&#x27;s porte-cochère was to be made vehicle-free and the station&#x27;s Grade II* listed buildings restored. The redevelopment also included the construction of another platform, more shops and a bridge to carry Nottingham Express Transit trams over the top of the station.

====Funding====
The redevelopment was initially estimated to cost £67 million. East Midlands Development Agency stated they would contribute £9.5 million to the project, but had to reduce this amount following government cuts. In July 2009, the then Transport Minister, Sadiq Khan, gave conditional approval for the city council to use funds raised from their controversial Workplace Parking Levy to contribute to the redevelopment.

The final funding was reorganised to be around £60 million, with Network Rail contributing £41 million, Nottingham City Council £14.8 million, EMDA £2.1 million, East Midlands Trains £1.6 million and the Railway Heritage Trust £0.5 million.

====Station masterplan====

In 2001, the architects Building Design Partnership (BDP) were appointed as the lead consultants, using the same team that had redeveloped based on an estimate of £550,000 and in cooperation with Posford Rail, MVA, Jones Lang LaSalle and Bovis Lend Lease.

*Stage 1 of the Nottingham Station Masterplan cost £99,960 and was launched at Loxley House on 19 July 2002. The main stakeholders at the time were Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, Central Trains, Midland Mainline, Nottingham Development Enterprise, Nottingham Regeneration Limited and the EMDA, which together acted as the Nottingham Railway Station Steering Group.
*State 2a of the masterplan preparation was budgeted to cost £59,940.63 and also to be undertaken by BDP.

BDP engaged Tuffin Ferraby Taylor to undertake surveys of all elements of the station dating from before 1918. As well as an integrated NET tram station above platform 6, the masterplan included an additional concourse and safeguarding for an additional platform.

====Car park====
Between 2011 and 2012, a new multi-storey car park was constructed between platform 6 and Queen&#x27;s Road, over the western half of the station&#x27;s existing car park. It was built by Vinci Construction beginning in March 2011 and officially opened on 14 May 2012.

The initial car park design had been put on hold in 2008, after being described as a &quot;chicken coop&quot;. The final design for the car park has 2,107 coloured metal sheets on the outside, formed of 2.1-millimetre-thick copper and stainless steel (1.5 mm stainless, 0.6 mm &quot;Luvata&quot; Copper). These panels are affixed to the car park using 8,000 cleats fixed to pre-cast channels in the concrete structure. The new car park building has five storeys and space for 950 cars.

====Remodelling====
Schemes costing £19 million (in 2007) and then £14 million (in 2008) were proposed. Remodelling and re-signalling costing £11.6 million were approved on 15 May 2009 by the Network Rail Investment Board and took place as part of Control Period 4 (CP4), between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2014. Nottingham station was partially closed for ten weeks during 2013 for the track and signalling work. During the blockade, the western end of the station was closed to trains for 37 days and the eastern end for 10 days.

Platform 4 was split to create two platforms. All four tracks at the western end were given bi-directional railway signalling, allowing a better choice of non-conflicting routes. These lines are referred to as Line A, Line B, Line C and Line D. Although all lines are bi-directional, their use is segregated, with services towards Sheffield and Mansfield focused on the northern pair of tracks, and services to Derby and Leicester focused on the southern pair of tracks. Line speeds for trains arriving from Chesterfield and the Robin Hood Line were increased from to . On 7 March 2012, Network Rail requested formal &quot;network change&quot; acceptance from the train operating companies.

On-site preparation works began in September 2011, with all new signal structures installed by June 2013 followed by the &quot;Nottingham blockade&quot;; this itself lasted from July 2013 until the handover in September 2013. The work was spread from Beeston, past Mansfield Junction, Nottingham West Junction and to Nottingham East Junction. The blockade covered renewing of track and adding or renewing 14 sets of pointwork.

====Entrances====
The station has three entrances Carrington Street (west), Trent Street/Station Street (north), and Queen&#x27;s Road (south). The north and south entrances are connected by a footbridge and public footpath. The north exit is the most heavily used and where the taxi rank is situated.

;1900s
During 1919/1920 the Midland Railway Company inhibited access via the Trent Street exit. On 24 February 1919 a petition &quot;signed by over 1,000 season-ticket holders&quot; was submitted to the Midland Railway Company. Member of Parliament for Nottingham Central Albert Atkey raised numerous questions in the House of Commons, answered by the President of the Board of Trade Auckland Geddes and Minster for Transport Eric Geddes. On 18 August 1919 the Chief Inspector of Railways John Wallace Pringle visited Nottingham Midlands Station &quot;in connection with this matter&quot;. By March 1920 local employer Boots the Chemist were offering to pay the Midland Railway for maintenance of the Trent Street entrance.

 On 27 April 1920 a petition was submitted to Parliament &quot;signed by the Mayor, Sheriff, and the Town Clerk on behalf of the civic authorities of Nottingham, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and the members of the Council, and 18,000 other users of the railway&quot;.
;2024
During October/November 2024 East Midlands Railway inhibited access via the Trent Street exit, from platforms 1‒6.
From 28 October 2024 East Midlands Railway had planned to inhibit access from platforms 1–6 (via the footbridge and the public right of way) to both Queen&#x27;s Road (south) and Trent Street (north) entrances. , access to both entrances remained open, with the planned pilot project under review.
Blocking of passenger access to the platforms was in place after 16:30 on 30 October 2024.

Taxi drivers based at the Trent Street exit were not informed of the pilot closure and had seen significantly reduced business.
Local members of parliament Nadia Whittome and Lilian Greenwood met with EMR on 1 November 2024. Leader of Nottingham City Council Neghat Khan met with EMR on 12 November 2024 and stated that the closure was &quot;crazy&quot;.
The pilot was planned to end on 17 November 2024. access had been re-instated.

====Footbridge====

Halfway along the platforms is an overhead footbridge, running from Station Street (at the north) and the tram stop link over station platforms 1–6 to platform 7 and car parking facilities at Queen&#x27;s Road (at the south). The footbridge carries footpath 28, the only traffic-free crossing over the Midland Main Line in Nottingham. Footpath 28 was previously diverted from the demolished footbridge 21 to the present footbridge 20 during the 1990s. The original route formed part of the Trent Bridge Footway, between the centre of Nottingham and the river crossing at Trent Bridge. In 2004, Nottingham City Council stated that right of way over the footbridge would be closed, following the completion of a multi-storey car park.

Alternative pavement improvement works were scheduled for Queens Road in February 2009. During 2008–2012, BPR Architects submitted designs for automated ticket gate (ATG) barrier installations at , , and Nottingham station concourses plus both ends of Nottingham footbridge 20. BPR&#x27;s design included four ATG barriers on the north end of the footbridge itself, plus a new enclosure and four barriers between the car park and platform 6 at the south end.&lt;ref name=&quot;10/00885/LLIS1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A procedure to permanently stop-up the right-of-way commenced on 19 March 2010, A planning application for barriers was filed on 29 March 2010 and withdrawn again on 10 May 2010. Following a public inquiry held during 8–9 November 2011, the stopping up order was denied; the inspector summing up:

The footbridge was scheduled to be closed temporarily in November 2017; the reasons given were &quot;making improvements&quot; and &quot;essential maintenance work&quot;.

===New bridge and tram stop===
To facilitate the Nottingham Express Transit&#x27;s phase two extension into the south of the city, it was decided to have the tram line cross the station on the line of the original Great Central Railway viaduct, which had been closed to passenger trains in 1967 and goods in 1973. This required a bridge, crossing from the existing Station Street stop, which closed, over both the station and Queen&#x27;s Road.

Construction of the tram bridge started on 10 April 2012 and the bridge was jacked into place in May 2013. The tram bridge design is a Warren truss design made of diameter steel tubes. The main bridge is wide between the truss centrelines, with two equal spans of . The bridge is officially called the Karlsruhe Friendship Bridge, after Nottingham&#x27;s twin city of Karlsruhe, Germany.

The new Nottingham Station tram stop was constructed on the bridge, providing interchange with the railway network. It replaced the previous Station Street tram stop, opened in 2004, which was located approximately to the north. The new stop was opened on 27 July 2015 and the former stop closed at the same time, although the intention is to reopen the Station Street access building as a second access to the new stop once it has been refurbished. The new stop served as the new southern terminus of the system until the rest of NET&#x27;s phase two opened, at which point it became a through station, with trams continuing to new termini in Chilwell and Clifton.

===2018 fire===
On the morning of 12 January 2018, a fire extensively damaged the station buildings. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service received a call at 6:25 am reporting that a fire had started in the women&#x27;s toilet in the newly built section of the station. The fire was attended by ten fire engines and 50 firefighters. Firefighters from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service also attended, bringing the total to 60.

After the fire began, it spread upwards into the roof of the newly built section of the station, along the station concourse and into the historic station building. There was extensive disruption to trains in the East Midlands area.

British Transport Police stated, later the same day, that they were treating the fire as arson and, on 2 February 2018, police reported that a 33-year-old woman had been arrested on suspicion of arson. In August 2019, a 34-year-old drug addict received a two-year jail sentence, having admitted to accidentally setting fire to a bin while using heroin and crack.

In February 2018, East Midlands Trains named one of their recently transferred Class 43 power cars (43467) &quot;Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service and British Transport Police Nottingham&quot; after their assistance during the fire.

==Layout and facilities==
===Layout===


The station is aligned approximately east to west, at the southern edge of the city centre, with Station Street to the north and Queen&#x27;s Road to the south. At the western end of the station, the tracks are spanned by Carrington Street and the station&#x27;s main entrance is on the eastern side of this street. Since the station&#x27;s redevelopment, the entrances from Carrington Street open into a concourse that spans the station from north to south. This occupies what was once the station&#x27;s porte-cochère and provides a large pedestrian circulation area, along with several retail sites.

The booking hall for the railway station opens off the centre of eastern side of the concourse and, in turn, gives access via ticket barriers to a pedestrian overbridge with stairs and lifts down to the railway platforms. A second concourse opens off the main concourse at the southern end of its eastern side; this runs parallel and to the south of the platforms, giving access by stairs, lifts and escalators to the tram stop, the station car park, taxi rank, vehicular pick-up and drop-off points, and Queen Street. The tram stop spans the station from north to south to the east of the main entrance, at a higher level than the concourse, and east of that a second footbridge links the platforms; it carries the previously referred-to footpath 28.

The station&#x27;s multi-storey car park lies south of the platforms, north of Queen Street, and east of the tram bridge. It provides parking for about 800 cars and the covered area below it houses the station&#x27;s new taxi rank, pick-up and drop-off points, relocated from the old porte-cochère.

===Railway platforms===
The railway platforms lie at a lower level than the station entrance and are within a ticket barrier enforced paid area. From north to south, the station has two island platforms and a single side platform, with a total of seven numbered platform faces. Each platform is linked to the main entrance concourse by stairs and lifts and to the second footbridge by stairs only.

The northern of the two island platforms has a bi-directionally signalled through platform face on each side, numbered 1 and 3, and an east-facing bay, numbered 2. The two through platforms are long enough to accommodate fifteen and fourteen coach trains, whilst the bay can accommodate a four-coach train.

The middle island platform also has bi-directionally signalled through platform faces on each side, numbered 4 and 6, together with a west-facing terminal platform face, numbered 5. Platform 4 can accommodate a five-coach train, platform 5 a seven-coach train and platform 6 a fourteen-coach train.

Finally the southern side platform is numbered 7 and can accommodate a thirteen-coach train. Sufficient space exists to the south of this platform to add a second platform face, effectively converting this side platform into an island platform, if traffic increases to justify it.

===Tram stop===
The new tram stop is positioned at a higher level than the station entrance and lies at a right angle to, and above, the railway platforms. It is designed as a through stop, with two side platforms flanking each side of the double tramway track. Like all NET stops, pedestrian access between the platforms is permitted on the level via crossings at each end of the platforms. Ticket machines are located on both platforms and the stop lies outside the ticket barrier-enforced paid area of the railway station.

The tram stop is connected directly to the railway station&#x27;s main concourse (and the railway platforms) via the new side concourse, with stairs, escalators and lifts bridging the height difference. A direct access is also provided to the station&#x27;s multi-storey car park. The former access from Station Street is also still available, accessible via a walkway running parallel to the railway tracks.

North of the stop, the tramway tracks pass over Station Street and through the abandoned platforms of the former Station Street stop, before proceeding along the old Great Central Main Line viaduct and eventually joining an on-street section through the centre of Nottingham. South of the new stop, the tracks pass over Queen&#x27;s Road before descending a ramp and re-joining the city&#x27;s streets at ground level. The junction between the Clifton and Chilwell branches of the NET system lies just beyond this point.

<text>Yvonne Perry (born October 23, 1966, in Voorheesville, New York, U.S.) is an American actress. After years doing commercials, and nearly a year as part of the improv team tricking people for Candid Camera, her big break came in 1992 when she landed the role of Rosanna Cabot on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. In 1993, she won the Soap Opera Digest award for Outstanding Female Newcomer which was the show&#x27;s first win in that category. She and on-screen love interest Shawn Christian (ex-Mike) were voted Hottest Soap Opera Couple by People Magazine in 1995. In 1996, she left the program but returned in 1998 and 1999.

After leaving &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, Yvonne studied in London with the Royal National Theatre, lived in LA for several years, and now resides in upstate NY with her husband, Mark, whom she married in 1993, and their two daughters. She remains very good friends with former co-stars, Martha Byrne (Lily, ex-Rose) and Kelley Menighan Hensley (Emily). She has been a Visiting Guest Artist at Union College in Schenectady, New York and currently teaches at Siena College, Skidmore College, and the State University of New York at Albany.

Yvonne still enjoys an active career as a freelance actress. She does regional theatre, commercials, voice-overs, books-on-tape, industrial films, and occasional independents.
In 2018 Yvonne became an Associate Artist at Capital Repertory Theatre in Albany, NY. - where she often performs, directs, and serves on the Next Act New Play Summit selection committee. She also serves as the vice-chair of the Greater Albany Area Liaison for Actors Equity.

She played a divorced mother of a young boy in a half-hour comedy pilot called &quot;Dads&quot; in 1997.

==Movie roles==
In 2006, she appeared in the film &quot;Ten &#x27;til Noon&quot; and in UnCivil Liberties. She appeared in two unreleased films, &quot;Winter of Frozen Dreams&quot; and &quot;Love Conquers Paul.&quot;

<text>John Perkins (born January 28, 1945) is an American author. His best known book is &quot;Confessions of an Economic Hit Man&quot; (2004), in which Perkins describes playing a role in a process of economic colonization of Third World countries on behalf of what he portrays as a cabal of corporations, banks, and the United States government. The book&#x27;s claims were contested by some involved parties. The book spent more than 70 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

Perkins has also written about mystical aspects of indigenous cultures, including shamanism.

==Life and career==
Perkins graduated from the Tilton School in 1963. He subsequently attended Middlebury College for two years before dropping out. He later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Boston University in 1968. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ecuador from 1968 to 1970. He spent the 1970s working for the Boston strategic-consulting firm Chas. T. Main; he claims to have been screened for this job by the National Security Agency (NSA) and subsequently hired by Einar Greve, a member of the firm (alleged by Perkins to have been acting as an NSA liaison, a claim that Greve has denied). Perkins claims that he was seduced and trained as an &quot;economic hitman&quot; by a mysterious businesswoman named Claudine, who used his NSA personality profile to manipulate and control him.

As chief economist at Chas. T. Main, Perkins claims to have advised the World Bank, United Nations, IMF, U.S. Treasury Department, Fortune 500 corporations, and countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Perkins alleges that he worked directly with heads of state and CEOs of major companies. Perkins&#x27;s time at Chas T. Main provides the basis for his subsequent claims that, as an &quot;economic hit man&quot;, he was charged with inducing developing countries to borrow large amounts of money, designated to pay for questionable infrastructure investments, but ultimately with a view to making the debt-laden countries more dependent, economically and politically, upon the West.

In the 1980s, Perkins left Main and founded and directed an independent energy company. Perkins implies in &quot;New Confessions of an Economic Hitman&quot;, published in 2016, that he was poisoned in 2005 on behalf of the NSA or CIA. Doctors diagnosed him with diverticulosis.

== Controversy ==
Sebastian Mallaby, economics columnist of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, reacted sharply to Perkins&#x27; book: describing him as &quot;a conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, &quot;Confessions of an Economic Hit Man&quot;, is a runaway bestseller.&quot; Mallaby, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, holds that Perkins&#x27; conception of international finance is &quot;largely a dream&quot; and that his &quot;basic contentions are flat wrong&quot;. As an example, Mallaby states that Indonesia reduced its infant mortality and illiteracy rates by two-thirds after economists persuaded its leaders to borrow money in 1970.

Articles in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Boston&quot; magazine have referred to a lack of documentary or testimonial evidence to corroborate the claim that the NSA was involved in his hiring by Chas T. Main. After an extensive investigation, the &quot;New York Times&quot; concluded that &quot;the arc of Mr. Perkins&#x27;s career seems to be described accurately&quot;, although they did not find evidence to support &quot;some of his fancier claims,&quot; including those involving the NSA.

Chas. T. Main&#x27;s former vice president Einar Greve, who first offered Perkins a job at the firm, agreed that foreign debt represented a poor economic strategy for developing nations:Basically his story is true.… What John&#x27;s book says is, there was a conspiracy to put all these countries on the hook, and that happened. Whether or not it was some sinister plot or not is up to interpretation, but many of these countries are still over the barrel and have never been able to repay the loans.However, Greve denied many aspects of Perkins&#x27; claims, such as the NSA having any links to Main, or that Perkins was seduced by Claudine Martin, saying that he believes that Perkins has convinced himself that his story is accurate. &quot;Boston&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot; noted that Perkins can provide little documentation to support his claims of international intrigue, describing a largely unconvincing &quot;flimsy package of materials.&quot; A number of Perkins&#x27; former colleagues disagreed with his perspective on the company and contradicted specific claims he made; Frank Fullerton, one of his supervisors, stated that Perkins left Chas T. Main because he &quot;thought he was worth more than he was&quot;.

In a 2006 statement, the American State Department stated that much of the book &quot;appears to be a total fabrication ... the National Security Agency is a cryptological (codemaking and codebreaking) organization, not an economic organization ... Neither of [its] missions involves anything remotely resembling placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries.&quot;

<doc id="1345383" wikidata="Q3136382" url="?curid=1345383" title="Hirotoki Onozawa">
<text>is a rugby union player who plays at Wing or occasionally Fullback for Canon Eagles. He previously played for Suntory Sungoliath and the Japan national rugby union team. Nicknamed &quot;the eel&quot; for his sharp sidestepping ability, Onozawa is the second most capped Japanese rugby player of all time, and fifth highest try scorer in international rugby. Despite spending much of his career in the shadow of Daisuke Ohata he is considered an all-time great of Japanese rugby in his own right.

== Career ==

Onozawa made his debut for Japan against in June 2001 and immediately impressed troubling the Welsh defence throughout and scored a try from 75 metres out from a move that he started himself. From there onwards he became a fixture in the Japan side.

He scored 8 tries in his first 7 caps playing at full back, but in 2003 moved to a spot on the wing. He played all of Japan&#x27;s matches at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, scoring in his first match against and his wing partnership with Daisuke Ohata at the tournament was noted as one of the most positive aspects of Japan&#x27;s tournament.

In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Onozawa again played in all Japan&#x27;s matches and notably scored a 70-metre individual try against . Over the next few years, Onozawa gradually kept increasing his try scoring record and by 2011 he entered the top 10 on the all time international try scoring list.

At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Onozawa played in all Japan&#x27;s matches for a third consecutive tournament, and also scored against to become the 15th player to score in a three World Cups.

Onozawa was retained by new coach Eddie Jones, and 2012 proved to be one of his most successful years at age 34, becoming the 5th player to score 50 international tries in May 2012 , and overall scoring 10 tries in 8 matches, including tries in Japan&#x27;s first ever wins away in Europe against and in November.

Into his 12th year of his international career in 2013, Onozawa won his 80th cap against to become the most capped Japanese player of all time, overtaking centre Yukio Motoki&#x27;s total of 79 caps. However he suffered with persistent injuries, including a long term shoulder injury which brought his international career effectively to a close with younger players coming through. He still was thought of in high regard by Eddie Jones though, who kept Onozawa with the squad in a mentoring role.

At domestic level, Onozawa played for 14 years with Suntory Sungoliath, before joining Canon Eagles in 2014 to finish his career. With Suntory Sungoliath he won the Top League three times, was the league&#x27;s leading try scorer in the 2009/10 and 2010/11 seasons, was named in the team of the season 8 times at the end of season awards, and was named the league&#x27;s overall MVP for the 2007/08 season. In October 2012, Onozawa became the first player to score 100 tries in the Top League.

<doc id="1345390" wikidata="Q1081019" url="?curid=1345390" title="Daisuke Ohata">
<text>is a former Japanese rugby union player. He usually played on the wing, and sometimes at centre, for the Japanese national team. He made his name internationally as a speedy ace in the World Rugby Sevens Series (then known as the IRB World Sevens Series), and went on to become a regular member of the national team. He first played for Japan on November 9, 1996, and scored three tries that day. He is the leading rugby union test try scorer of all time. In November 2016, Ohata was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame at the opening ceremony for the Hall&#x27;s first physical location in Rugby, Warwickshire.

==Life and career==
Ohata was born in Osaka and speaks with a strong Kansai accent. He attended rugby nurseries Tokai Dai Gyosei High School with Koji Uehara and Yoshinori Tateyama, where the three were classmates, and Kyoto Sangyo University.

==World record holder==
On 14 May 2006, Ohata scored three tries for Japan against Georgia at Hanazono Stadium, in doing so claiming the world record for tries in rugby test matches. This gave him sixty-five tries for his country in fifty-five tests; he has since extended his record to sixty-nine tries from fifty-eight tests. The record was previously held by David Campese of Australia, who scored 64 tries from 101 tests. Brian Habana of South Africa eclipsed Campese&#x27;s record with 67 tries (124 caps), the last one coming in 2016. However, unlike Campese and Habana, only a quarter of Ohata&#x27;s tries were scored against major rugby union playing nations, causing controversy in some media.

Ohata did not take part in the Rugby World Cup 2007, as he had ruptured his left Achilles tendon in an August practice match against Portugal. He had only just returned that month to the national side, having recovered from a right Achilles tendon rupture in January.
In January 2011 Ohata&#x27;s retirement was announced. Ohata, being 35-years-old, stated: “It&#x27;s sad that it ended like this but I think I have had a good career. I feel I have left my mark as a rugby player.”

==Sportsman No.1==
Ohata is one of prominent Pro Sportsman No.1 competitors during early 2000&#x27;s tenure, as he particularly shined in the 2001 and 2003 Pro Sportsman tournaments, achieves No.1 in said tournaments. He also earned New World Record of Shot-Gun-Touch event at the time by achieving 13m40cm.

<text>The Wigmore Hall is a concert hall at 36 Wigmore Street, in west London. It was designed by Thomas Edward Collcutt and opened in 1901 as the Bechstein Hall; it is considered to have particularly good acoustics. It specialises in performances of chamber music, early music, vocal music and song recitals, and hosts over five hundred concerts each year, as well as a weekly concert broadcast on BBC Radio 3.

== Bechstein Hall ==
The Bechstein Hall was built between 1899 and 1901 by C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik, the German piano manufacturer, whose showroom was next door. The British architect Thomas Edward Collcutt was commissioned to design the space. Collcutt was also responsible for the Savoy Hotel on The Strand (since modified) and the Palace Theatre on Cambridge Circus (originally the Royal English Opera House), with which the Hall shares pale terracotta ornamentation.

Bechstein Hall opened on 31 May 1901 with a concert featuring pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni and violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. During its early period the Hall attracted great musicians like Artur Schnabel, Peter Arnold, Pablo Sarasate, Percy Grainger, Myra Hess, Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Rosing, Alexander Siloti, Camille Saint-Saëns, Jascha Spivakovsky, Max Reger and Marian Anderson (who performed there in 1933).

The Bechstein Company built similar concert halls in Saint Petersburg and Paris, though like its London offices and performing space, these and the business as a whole suffered during the First World War. Bechstein was forced to cease trading in Britain on 5 June 1916 after the passing of the Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1916 and all property, including the concert hall and the showrooms, was seized and summarily closed. In 1916 the Hall was sold as enemy property at auction to Debenhams for £56,500 – a figure considerably short of the £100,000 cost of the building alone. It was then rechristened Wigmore Hall and opened under the new name in 1917.

== Design ==

The Wigmore Hall follows the Renaissance style, using alabaster and marble walls, which furnish a flat, rectangular hall with a small raised stage area complete with a cupola above depicting the Soul of Music. The distinctive mural was designed by Gerald Moira, who was responsible for a number of contemporary public art works; he later became principal of the Edinburgh College of Art. After the completion of the design, the cupola was executed by the sculptor Frank Lynn Jenkins. It was restored in 1991 and 1992 and has often been featured in the Hall&#x27;s marketing and print material.

The Hall is considered to have one of the best acoustics for classical music in Europe. It was refurbished in 2004 and was widely praised for being completed on time and on budget. The Hall&#x27;s current capacity, spread across the stalls and a smaller balcony, is 545 seats. In 2005, the Wigmore Hall Trust purchased a long lease of 300 years for £3.1m. This both secured the future of the Hall and allowed money previously required for rent to be used for further development of its artistic programme. There are two bars and a restaurant on the lower ground floor, below the main auditorium.

== Artists and associations ==

Wigmore Hall enjoyed a number of long associations with many great artists of the 20th century including Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los Ángeles, Sergey Prokofiev, Shura Cherkassky, Paul Hindemith, Andrés Segovia, Peter Pears, Benjamin Britten and Francis Poulenc.

=== Benjamin Britten ===
The Hall maintained a particularly fruitful relationship with Benjamin Britten, both as composer and performer. His &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot;, the Second String Quartet, &quot;The Holy Sonnets of John Donne&quot; and &quot;Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo&quot; were premièred at the Hall, as were extracts from the opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (ahead of its world première at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in June 1945).

Wigmore Hall commemorated its association with Britten with a series of performances and events entitled &#x27;Before Life and After&#x27; in November and December 2012. Those concerts featured artists such as Alice Coote, Ann Murray, Mark Padmore, Gerald Finley, Julius Drake, Malcolm Martineau, Martyn Brabbins, Nash Ensemble and the Takács Quartet, given to mark the beginning of a year-long international celebration of the 100th anniversary of Britten&#x27;s birth.

Wigmore Hall&#x27;s 2019–20 season featured a series focusing on Britten and his connections with the venue. Allan Clayton and James Baillieu commemorated the first performance of &quot;Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo&quot;, given by Britten and his partner, the tenor Peter Pears, on 23 September 1942, alongside a lineup of additional singers in further Britten works. Later in the season, Wigmore Hall commemorated both Britten&#x27;s birthday and the anniversary of his death.

== &quot;Lieder&quot; and song ==
Since its inception, the Hall has been a major hub for &quot;Lieder&quot; and art song performance. The British première of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; took place at Wigmore Hall in 1903 as well as the first UK performance of Janáček&#x27;s song cycle &quot;The Diary of One Who Disappeared&quot; in 1922.

Peter Schreier, Janet Baker and Margaret Price performed regularly at the Hall, and in recent years Wigmore has produced recitals featuring Thomas Quasthoff, Ian Bostridge, Susan Graham, Mark Padmore, Sir Thomas Allen, Matthias Goerne, Dame Felicity Lott, Angelika Kirchschlager, Simon Keenlyside, Anne Sofie von Otter, Wolfgang Holzmair, Christopher Maltman, Andreas Scholl, and Soile Isokoski. More recent performers include Christian Gerhaher, Florian Boesch, Roderick Williams, Iestyn Davies, Sandrine Piau, Lucy Crowe and Henk Neven.

== Piano and chamber music ==
Instrumentalists and chamber groups performing at the hall include Leslie Howard, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Charlie Siem, Stephen Kovacevich, András Schiff, Joshua Bell, Maxim Vengerov, Angela Hewitt, Steven Isserlis, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Steven Osborne, Stephen Hough, Bruce Brubaker, the Nash Ensemble, the Beaux Arts and Florestan Trios and the Artemis, Aviv, Belcea, Emerson, Endellion, Hagen, Jerusalem, Takács and Zehetmair Quartets. In recent years, artists and ensembles including Igor Levit, Iestyn Davies, the Doric String Quartet, The Elias String Quartet, Ning Feng, Francesco Piemontesi, Alina Ibragimova, Mahan Esfahni, Arcangelo, Hilary Hahn, Thomas Ades, Sir George Benjamin, Julia Fisher, Nicola Benedetti, Isabele Faust, Bretton Brown, and Christian Gerharher have become associated with and connected to Wigmore Hall through concert series and artistic residencies. The Hall is noted for helping young artists launch and develop their international careers.

The following chamber works had their UK premières at the Hall: Janáček&#x27;s Sonata for violin and piano; Bartók&#x27;s six string quartets; Schoenberg&#x27;s String Quartet No. 2; Debussy&#x27;s Violin Sonata; Copland&#x27;s Contrasts; and Richard Strauss&#x27;s Sextet from &quot;Capriccio&quot;.

== Director ==
Wigmore Hall&#x27;s director is Limerick-born John Gilhooly, OBE, a classical singer. He joined as CEO in 2000 and became artistic director in addition in 2005 at the age of 32. Gilhooly has maintained and expanded the Hall&#x27;s core repertoire of classical song, chamber and early music, as well as introducing new initiatives to attract a more diverse audience. Gilhooly introduced jazz evenings, curated by the American jazz pianist Brad Mehldau. World music is also a regular feature and there is a series of late night concerts, which have attracted new younger listeners.

The previous artistic director was Paul Kildea. Before him, William Lyne served as director for 37 years from 1966 to 2003, during which time he introduced themed seasons, the first of which was the Fauré Series in 1979–80, with subsequent programmes dedicated to Schumann, Purcell, Bach, Ligeti, Haydn, Shostakovich and Vaughan Williams.

== New music ==
Building on its heritage, Wigmore Hall has become a major commissioner of new music. On 31 August 2007, John Gilhooly announced a scheme for modern composers.

=== Composer-in-Residence ===
Wigmore fosters further links with the contemporary music scene through the introduction of its Composer-in-Residence scheme. Luke Bedford became the first Composer-in-Residence in 2009 and was succeeded by Julian Anderson in 2013. Alongside performances of their work, Wigmore has featured series of concerts dedicated to the music of Sir George Benjamin, Huw Watkins, Thomas Larcher, Elliott Carter, Brett Dean, Kevin Volans, James MacMillan and Jörg Widmann. The 2019–20 season Composer-in-Residence was Vijay Iyer.

=== Recent commissions ===
In 2012, John Gilhooly publicised a renewed commissioning scheme, supported by a major gift from the Fondation Hoffmann and its president, the Swiss businessman, conservationist and philanthropist, André Hoffmann. The Fondation&#x27;s donation has ensured the commission of new works by Julian Anderson, Peter Eötvös, Anna Meredith, Nico Muhly, Wolfgang Rihm, Judith Weir and Jörg Widmann and from 2013 the Hall has committed to premièring 13 new works per season.

== Competitions ==
The biennial Wigmore Hall/Independent Opera International Song Competition (formerly the Wigmore Hall/Kohn Foundation International Song Competition) was founded in 1997 and has run at the venue since then. After 20 years of support from The Kohn Foundation, the 2019 Competition was sponsored by Independent Opera at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Independent Opera&#x27;s relationship with Wigmore Hall dates back 10 years to its first Wigmore Hall/Independent Opera Voice Fellowship awarded to bass Matthew Rose. The Preliminary Round, the Semi-Finals and Final are held at Wigmore Hall.

Sinc July 2020 the Hall has also hosted the triennial Wigmore Hall International String Quartet Competition (formerly The London International String Quartet Competition and initially the Portsmouth International String Quartet Competition).
Singers and pianists aged 33 or under from around the world are eligible.

== Broadcasts and recordings ==
The hall is a venue for broadcasting and recording. BBC Radio 3 transmits its lunchtime concert from Wigmore Hall every Monday during the season, which runs from September to July. Recent BBC Lunchtime Concerts have featured Benjamin Grosvenor, the Škampa Quartet, Christoph Denoth, Noriko Ogawa, Gautier Capuçon, Gabriela Montero, the ATOS Trio, Clara Mouriz, Mark Padmore and Yevgeny Sudbin. A number of evening concerts are also broadcast live or recorded for later transmission on Sky Arts TV as well as being released by recording companies.

== Wigmore Hall Live ==
Wigmore Hall also publishes recordings of concerts by prominent artists on its own record label Wigmore Hall Live, receiving the special award Label of the Year in the 2011 &quot;Gramophone&quot; Awards. The label entered the classical charts with a recital by the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, which has also been nominated for a &quot;Gramophone&quot; Award. Recent additions to the catalogue include recitals by the violinist Maxim Vengerov of works by Bach and Beethoven and baritone Roderick Williams&#x27;s concert of works by Mahler, Korngold and Schumann, accompanied by the Austrian pianist Helmut Deutsch.

== Wigmore Hall Learning ==

Since 1994, Wigmore Hall&#x27;s Learning programme has been giving people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities opportunities to take part in creative music making, engaging a broad and diverse audience through creative projects, concerts, workshops and online resources. Every year there are around 600 Learning events, with nearly 30,000 visits to the programme.

Wigmore Hall Learning collaborates with community, education, arts, health and social care organisations, working in partnership to engage people who might not otherwise have the opportunity to take part. The programme includes work with schools, including concerts, teacher training, projects with hospital schools and the innovative Partner Schools Programme, in which Wigmore Hall Learning works in partnership with schools and Music Education Hubs to co-produce activity over three years, creating a creative whole school plan for music.

Families are invited to the hall to take part in interactive workshops and concerts for families with babies, children in their early years and children aged 5+. Community partnerships include Music for Life (for people living with dementia and their families, friends and carers), projects with the Cardinal Hume Centre, which enable people to gain the skills they need to overcome poverty and homelessness, and activity with Solace Women&#x27;s Aid, which supports women and children who have experienced domestic violence.

Pathways is a range of schemes and events which provides a platform for emerging artists, supporting the next generation of musicians and music leaders. This includes annual Trainee Music Leaders, Royal Academy of Music / Wigmore Hall Fellowship Ensemble and RPS / Wigmore Hall Apprentice Composer schemes, as well as Bechstein Sessions, a new series of informal performances which showcase emerging talent.

Behind the Music is a programme of study events including talks, lecture-recitals, masterclasses, study groups and Come and Sing days.

<text>Trinket Island (sometimes spelled Trinkat or Trinkut) is one of the 24 islands that make up the Nicobar Islands chain, located in the northeast Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. It is located east of Kamorta Island.

== Geography ==

Trinket has an area of 12.25 km², and a flat, low topography. Regional monsoons bring rains of 3,000 mm to 3,800 mm yearly.

The island is surrounded by shallow waters and coral reefs, which allow it to be approached by boat only during high tide.

== Administration ==

From 1869 until 1947 Trinket was part of Britain&#x27;s Indian colonies. In 1947 it became part of the Dominion of India, and since 1950 of the Republic of India. Trinket is part of the Kamorta tehsil, Nancowry subdivision of the Nicobar District, and part of the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands state.

Since 1956 the Government of India has afforded protection to the native Nicobarese through a special legislation, the &quot;Andaman and Nicobar Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation&quot;, which regulated entry to the islands.

== Demographics ==

Two early censuses of the island were conducted by the British administration in 1883 and 1901. The 1883 census revealed a population of 85 persons living in eight villages. The 1901 census indicated an estimated population of 102 persons, spread between four and six villages, ruled by two chiefs.

As of 2001, the Indian census had catalogued 436 persons living on Trinket in four villages: Trinket (population 244), Safebalu (pop. 127), Tapiang (pop. 42) and Hockcook (pop. 23). Like most other islands in the Nicobar district, Trinket&#x27;s population was almost exclusively ethnic Nicobarese.

Although, the 2011 Census of India indicated that the island had become uninhabited following the 2004 tsunami disaster, as of the end of 2012 the island appeared to have been repopulated by a pair of returnees, living at the site of what had been Trinket village. By 2020 the population of returnees was reported to amount to a total of seven families.

== Economy ==

From the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, trade with Trinket, as with the rest of the Nicobar Islands, was dominated by Indian, Arab, and European merchant fleets.

Prior to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the island&#x27;s populace was dependent on the outside world for many goods, including foodstuffs. Until the 1950s they exported whole coconuts and other forest products, but after the 1950s local production shifted toward exports of processed coconut, in the form of copra. Those products were traded for imports such as rice, sugar, and clothes, which were used to supplement the local subsistence economy based on hunting and gathering, fishing, pig and chicken rearing, and household gardens.

== History ==
Trinket was officially made subject to the British Empire in 1869. The island became part of sovereign India following Indian independence in 1947.

=== Effects of 2004 earthquake and tsunami ===

==== Physical effects ====
Like the other Nicobar and Andaman Islands, Trinket was devastated by tsunamis generated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The island, which has a low and flat topography, was severely affected by the powerful waves and by earthquake-caused subduction of 1.5m to 1.75 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 9 in), suffering a reduction of its surface area from 14.6 km² down to 12.25 km². Initial reports that the island had been split apart were later confirmed by satellite imagery and onsite surveys.

==== Human toll ====
On Trinket, the tsunami left 91 dead or disappeared and the total devastation of the island&#x27;s communities and economy. Shortly after the disaster, the entire remaining population of the island was evacuated to neighboring islands, principally Nancowry, and Kamorta, where the Indian government built a resettlement village called Vikas Nagar.

=== Repopulation of the island ===

By the end of 2012, only two people, both returnees, were reported to be living permanently on the island. A few more refugees have returned as of 2017, amounting to a total of seven families as of 2020.

<text>Marcello Truzzi (September 6, 1935 – February 2, 2003) was an American sociologist and academic who was professor of sociology at New College of Florida and later at Eastern Michigan University, founding co-chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), a founder of the Society for Scientific Exploration, and director for the Center for Scientific Anomalies Research.

Truzzi was an investigator of various protosciences and pseudosciences and, as fellow CSICOP cofounder Paul Kurtz dubbed him &quot;the skeptic&#x27;s skeptic&quot;. He is credited with originating the oft-used phrase &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof&quot;, though earlier versions existed.

==Early life and education==
Truzzi was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was the only child of juggler Massimiliano Truzzi and his wife Sonya. His family moved to the United States in 1940 where his father performed with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

Truzzi earned several degrees in sociology: his Bachelor of Arts from Florida State University in 1957, his Master of Arts from the University of Florida in 1962, and his doctorate from Cornell University in 1970. He served in the United States Army between 1958 and 1960; he became a naturalized citizen in 1961.

== Career ==
A professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University from 1974–2003, Truzzi served as the chair of the sociology department from 1974 to 1985.

Truzzi also taught at Cornell, the University of South Florida, the University of Michigan, and the New College of Florida. His 1968 textbook, “&quot;Sociology in Every Day Life&quot;,” was a best-seller.

Truzzi founded the skeptical journal &quot;Explorations&quot;. In 1976, Truzzi was a founding member of the skeptic organization CSICOP and served as its co-chairman along with Paul Kurtz. Truzzi&#x27;s journal became the official journal of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) and was renamed &quot;The Zetetic&quot; (&quot;zetetic&quot; is another name for &quot;skeptic&quot; and is not to be confused with zetetics, the study of the relationship of art and science). The journal was under his editorship for the first year, until August 1977. He left CSICOP about a year after its founding, after receiving a vote of no confidence from the group&#x27;s Executive Council. Truzzi wanted to include pro-paranormal people in the organization and pro-paranormal research in the journal, but CSICOP felt that there were already enough organizations and journals dedicated to the paranormal. Kendrick Frazier became the editor of CSICOP&#x27;s journal and the name was changed to &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;.

After leaving CSICOP, Truzzi started another journal, the &quot;Zetetic Scholar&quot;. He promoted the term &quot;zeteticism&quot; as an alternative to &quot;skepticism&quot;, because he thought that the latter term was being usurped by what he termed &quot;pseudoskeptics&quot;. A zetetic is a &quot;skeptical seeker&quot;. The term&#x27;s origins lie in the word for the followers of the skeptic Pyrrho in ancient Greece. &quot;Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; memorialized Truzzi thus:Truzzi considered most skeptics to be pseudoskeptics, a term he coined to describe those who assume an occult or paranormal claim is false without bothering to investigate it. A kind way to state these differences might be to say that Marcello belonged to the Pyrrhonian tradition, most of the rest of us belong to the Academic skeptical tradition.Truzzi was skeptical of investigators and debunkers who determined the validity of a claim prior to investigation. He accused CSICOP of increasingly unscientific behavior, for which he coined the term &quot;pseudoskepticism&quot;. Truzzi stated:

Truzzi held that CSICOP researchers sometimes also put unreasonable limits on the standards for proof regarding the study of anomalies and the paranormal. Martin Gardner wrote: &quot;In recent years he (Truzzi) has become a personal friend of Uri Geller; not that he believes Uri has psychic powers, as I understand it, but he admires Uri for having made a fortune by pretending he is not a magician.&quot;

Truzzi co-authored a book on psychic detectives entitled &quot;The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime&quot;. It investigated many psychic detectives and concluded: &quot;[W]e unearthed new evidence supporting &quot;both&quot; sides in the controversy. We hope to have shown that much of the debate has been extremely simplistic.&quot; The book also stated that the evidence didn&#x27;t meet the burden of proof demanded for such an extraordinary claim.

Although he was familiar with &quot;folie à deux&quot;, Truzzi was confident a shared visual hallucination could not be skeptically examined by one of the participators. Thus he categorized it as an anomaly. In a 1982 interview Truzzi stated that controlled ESP (ganzfeld) experiments had &quot;gotten the right results&quot; maybe 60 percent of the time. This question remains controversial. Truzzi remained an advisor to IRVA, the International Remote Viewing Association, from its founding meeting until his death.

Truzzi was Keynote Speaker at the 1st annual National Roller Coaster Conference, &quot;CoasterMania&quot;, held at Cedar Point Amusement Park, Sandusky, Ohio, in 1978. On the subject of riding in the front vs riding in the back of a roller coaster, he said:
Truzzi died from cancer on February 2, 2003.

== Pseudoskepticism ==
Marcello Truzzi popularized the term &quot;pseudoskepticism&quot; in response to skeptics who, in his opinion, made negative claims without bearing the burden of proof of those claims.

While a Professor of Sociology at Eastern Michigan University in 1987, Truzzi discussed pseudoskepticism in the journal &quot;Zetetic Scholar&quot; which he had founded:

In 1994 Susan Blackmore, a parapsychologist who became more skeptical and eventually became a CSICOP fellow in 1991, described what she termed the &quot;worst kind of pseudoskepticism&quot;:

==&quot;Extraordinary claims&quot;==
Truzzi&#x27;s remark is derived from the 18th century French mathematician Pierre-Simon de Laplace&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (the more extraordinary a fact is, the more it needs to be supported by strong evidence). Carl Sagan later popularized Truzzi&#x27;s adaptation of Laplace as &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;, which came to be known as the Sagan standard.

==Martin Gardner – Truzzi correspondence==
In 2017, &quot;World Scientific&quot; released a book edited by Dana Richards about the correspondence between Martin Gardner and Truzzi. The book called &quot;Dear Martin, Dear Marcello: Gardner and Truzzi on Skepticism&quot; is broken up into four sections; &quot;The Road to CSICOP&quot;, &quot;The Demarcation Problem&quot;, &quot;The Dissolution&quot;, and the &quot;Return to Cordiality&quot;. The early letters from Truzzi were not preserved and the beginning of the book seems one-sided with only Gardner&#x27;s letters. The editor, Richards states in the introduction the conflicts between the two men, their differing goals for CSICOP, and various people in the skeptic and paranormal communities. They discuss many topics including publishers, Geller, and the &quot;definitions of charlatan and crankpot&quot;.

<text>Marguerite Jones Harbert (1923 – March 17, 2015) was an American philanthropist and billionaire from Alabama.

==Early life==
Margarite Jones was born in 1923 in Birmingham, Alabama. Her father was Raymond McAdoo Jones and her mother, Marguerite Nabers Jones. She had a sister, Alice McGriff. She descended from Birmingham&#x27;s founders.

She was educated at Mountain Brook Elementary School and Phillips High School. She graduated from Birmingham–Southern College, where she served as president of the Kappa Delta sorority chapter.

==Philanthropy==
Jones worked for the American Red Cross in Jefferson County, Alabama. Later, she volunteered for the &quot;Junior League of Birmingham, Advent Day School, All-Saints School, Children&#x27;s Hospital, Center for Developmental Learning Disabilities, Spain Rehabilitation, Birmingham Art Association, Birmingham Ballet League, American Heart Association and Linly Heflin Unit.&quot; A member of the American Needlepoint Guild, she needlepointed an armchair for Alabama Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

She served on the Board of Trustees of her alma mater, Birmingham-Southern College, where the Marguerite Jones Harbert Building was named in her honor. She was also inducted into its Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. She also served on the Boards of Trustees of the Birmingham Museum of Art and Cancer Comprehensive. Additionally, she served on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

==Personal life==
She married John M. Harbert, the founder of Harbert Corporation, whom she had met in grade school. They had two sons, John Murdoch Harbert IV (born with William&#x27;s Syndrome) and Raymond J.

<doc id="1345426" wikidata="Q16200093" url="?curid=1345426" title="Samuel Jordan">
<text>Samuel Jordan (died 1623) was an early settler and Ancient Planter of colonial Jamestown. He arrived in Virginia around 1610, and served as a Burgess in the first representative legislative session in North America. Jordan patented a plantation which he called &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Bush&quot;, which later became known as Jordan&#x27;s Journey. It became a safe haven and stronghold for settlers during the Second Anglo-Powhatan War that ensued after the Powhatan surprise attack of 1622.

==Early life and arrival in New World==
Samuel Jordan came to Virginia sometime around 1610, as his 1620 patent mentions him as having lived ten years in the colony.

Samuel Jordan&#x27;s early life is uncertain. Alexander Brown suggests &quot;he was probably married more than once&quot;. Some authors state that he had three sons from a first wife who were born in England: Robert, Samuel, and Thomas. Though the genealogist John Dorman does not mention either Robert or Samuel, he does acknowledge the possibility that Thomas Jordan, who arrived in Virginia at age 18 aboard &quot;Diana&quot; in 1619, could be Samuel&#x27;s son from an earlier marriage in England; however, he points out there is no conclusive evidence to establish this relation.

==Role in Virginia government==

When Deputy-Governor George Yeardley called the first representative legislative assembly in Virginia in 1619, Jordan served as a Burgess on behalf of Charles City. During this first meeting, Jordan also served on the committee of readers for the Great Charter, which been recently received from the Virginia Company and had authorized the assembly. As a privilege granted by the Great Charter, Jordan also became an ancient planter, which entitled him to 100 acres of land.

==Marriage to Cecily==
Sometime before 1620, Jordan married Cecily, who had arrived in Virginia around 1611 and was around 18 when they married. By 1621, their first daughter Mary had been born, and when Jordan died in 1623, Cecily was pregnant with her second daughter, Margaret.
In 1620, Samuel Jordan officially received his patent for 450 acres of land. This patent included 200 acres for both his and Cecily&#x27;s claim as ancient planters, as well as an additional 250 acres as headright for paying the transportation costs to Virginia for five indentured servants. Jordan&#x27;s patent, located at today&#x27;s Jordan Point, Virginia, was originally known as Beggars Bush and later as Jordan&#x27;s Journey.

When the paramount chief Opechancanough of the Powhatan Confederacy launched the surprise attack of 1622 that killed nearly a third of the English colonists and triggered the Second Anglo-Powhatan War, nobody from Jordan&#x27;s Journey was listed as killed. Jordan&#x27;s Journey withstood the attack and became a fortified refuge. After the initial assault, many of the outlying settlements were temporarily abandoned, and most of the colonists were ordered to move to a small number of relatively safer settlements, one of which was Jordan&#x27;s Journey. As a result, Jordan&#x27;s Journey grew. In February 1624, 42 people were living at Jordan&#x27;s Journey; a year later, 56 people were living there.

==Death and legacy==
Samuel Jordan died sometime before mid-February 1623, as his name does not appear among living at Jordan&#x27;s Journey in a list submitted to the Virginia Company that month.

Soon after his burial, his widow Cecily Jordan became involved in the first breach-of-promise dispute in North America. The lawsuit was filed by Rev. Greville Pooley, who had proposed marriage to the widow three days after the funeral. Cecily Jordan ultimately won the case, then in 1625 married William Farrar, who was bonded to execute Samuel Jordan&#x27;s will. Rev. Pooley took the case to the Virginia Council, claiming his proposal had initially been accepted but in 1625 formally forswore any claim against her. The outcome of this dispute not only determined who would marry Cecily, but also who would ultimately have say over the management of Jordan&#x27;s property. Even though William Farrar had married Cecily, the lists of patents sent back to England still listed Jordan&#x27;s Journey as owned by the Jordan family. Farrar eventually acquired his own rights to a 2000-acre patent on Farrar&#x27;s Island at the site of what had previously been Henricus, Historian Martha McCartney suggests Jordan&#x27;s Journey may have remained with one or both of Jordan&#x27;s daughters, but their fates are not recorded.

<text>Magic Hat Brewing Company is a wholly owned brand of Florida Ice &amp; Farm Co., which is headquartered in Costa Rica. It began production as an independent craft brewer in South Burlington, Vermont in 1994, and the brand is distributed across the United States. Their flagship beer, the apricot-tinged #9, is widely regarded as a significant early force in introducing many Americans to craft beer, especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==History==
Magic Hat Brewing Company was formed in 1994 in Burlington, Vermont by serial entrepreneur Alan Newman and Bob Johnson, the company&#x27;s original brewmaster. It expanded and moved to an industrial park in neighboring South Burlington in 1997. By 2005 it had 64 employees. In 2008 the company purchased Pyramid Breweries, makers of the Pyramid and MacTarnahan&#x27;s brands, expanding to 129 employees. 

===Acquisitions and eventual shutdown of Vermont space===
In 2010, Alan Newman sold Magic Hat and all of its assets to North American Breweries, a subsidiary of KPS Capital Partners, a private equity firm with a business model described by Newman as &quot;stripping out expense and flipping.&quot; The new owners did exactly that: in December 2012, North American Breweries was purchased by Florida Ice &amp; Farm Company (FIFCO), a Costa Rican food and beverages company.

FIFCO soon began producing some Magic Hat beer at their Genesee Brewing Company plant in Rochester, New York. The Vermont brewery continued to operate until June 2020, when FIFCO announced that it intended to consolidate the rest of Magic Hat&#x27;s brewing operations to the Rochester location. Another Burlington based brewery, Zero Gravity, assumed the lease on Magic Hat&#x27;s physical plant, along with the brewing and retail assets within the space. 43 of Magic Hat&#x27;s 46 Vermont employees were laid off, although Zero Gravity was in talks to rehire some of them. Zero Gravity moved into the space and began producing beer there in July 2020.

==Brands==

Magic Hat brews five year-round beers: #9 &quot;Not Quite Pale Ale&quot;, Taken for Granite, Mother Lager, Citrus Box, Ob-La-Di, What&#x27;s on Stage, Nirav, Elder Betty and Single Chair. It also produces up to four seasonal beers, seasonal variety packs and several limited release products.

<text>Hugh Panaro (born February 19, 1964) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for his work in Broadway stage musicals, most well known for his role in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; being in over 2,000 performances in the Broadway production.

His most recent stage performance was in 2018 as the title role in the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;.

==Early life==
Hugh Panaro was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and resided in the East Oak Lane section of the city with his family. As a schoolchild, he attended St. Helena’s parochial school in the adjoining Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney. He played organ for the parish church from age twelve. Panaro graduated from La Salle College High School, in Springfield (Montgomery County, Pennsylvania) in 1982.

==Career==
Having a love for animals since childhood, he considered becoming a veterinarian, an ambition which was never fulfilled as he fell in love with theater after having seen his first Broadway musical, starring fellow Philadelphian Andrea McArdle, as an adolescent. Hugh appeared in high school productions of &quot;Godspell&quot; and &quot;Pippin,&quot; as well as numerous regional and dinner theater productions throughout his teen years; with his first stage role being Friedrich in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. He began performing at the age of 13 and studied voice with Robert Grooters at the Boyer College of Music and Dance at Temple University.

His pre-Broadway and regional roles include &#x27;Mary Sunshine&#x27; in &quot;Chicago&quot;, and the lead in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. He made his Broadway debut as Marius in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, a role he originated in the first U.S. national touring company. Hugh created the roles of Buddy in &quot;Side Show&quot; and Julian in Jule Styne&#x27;s last musical, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. He made his West End debut in the original London company of Harold Prince&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot; as Ravenal, the role he played on Broadway and in Toronto.

At Avery Fisher Hall, he performed with the Radio City Rockettes in Jerry Herman&#x27;s &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; and also in &quot;The Stephen Sondheim Gala&quot;, the culmination of the Kennedy Center&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Sondheim,&quot; where Hugh played Anthony Hope in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;. In Los Angeles, Hugh played Franklin Shepard in &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; and received an Ovation Award nomination for his performance as Kenneth in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, both for &quot;Reprise!&quot;. As a concert artist, Hugh has performed with symphony orchestras across the U.S. and abroad and can be heard on numerous recordings. He is one of the few actors to play both the roles of Raoul (1991) and the Phantom (1999) in the Broadway production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, but after wearing the mask for only a few months, he left to play the title role in the American premiere of Sir Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s &quot;Martin Guerre&quot;. Panaro returned to play the title role at the Majestic Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Phantom&quot; until October 1, 2005. In late 2005 he created the title role in the Elton John musical, Lestat. At Seattle&#x27;s 5th Avenue Theatre, he performed leading roles in two Stephen Sondheim musicals: Bobby in &quot;Company&quot;, and George in &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; (the latter a recreation of the Menier Chocolate Factory production, directed by Sam Buntrock). In 1998, he appeared as a Hotel Clerk in one episode of Law &amp; Order. He appeared in the 1997 romantic comedy, &quot;Broadway Damage&quot;.

He has performed in a number of concerts and benefits, including &#x27;An Evening With Hugh Panaro&#x27; at the University of Findlay in Ohio, The Leading Men II at the venerable Birdland Jazz Club, and Broadway For Medicine at City Center. Following his performance in the March 26, 2007, Broadway Musicals of 1938 concert, Hugh invited fans to suggest songs for his first solo album. In the summer of 2007, Hugh was one of four Broadway performers joining Barbra Streisand on her first European concert tour. He starred as Jean Valjean in a new, non-replica production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at Philadelphia&#x27;s Walnut Street Theatre for which he received the 2008 Barrymore Award for Outstanding Actor In A Musical.

In 2009, he starred in &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle and appeared as &#x27;Fagin&#x27; in &quot;Oliver!&quot; to rave reviews before hometown audiences at the Walnut Street Theatre, opening November 18, 2009, through January 10, 2010. He was later active as a concert artist appearing with symphonies throughout the United States and Canada.

Panaro returned to the title role in the Broadway production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; on September 7, 2010. He replaced John Cudia in the role. This was Panaro&#x27;s third time playing The Phantom in this production. In January 2013, he performed the role in the Broadway production&#x27;s 25th anniversary. He took a break from &quot;Phantom&quot; from April until the end of August 2013. During this time, he reprised the role of Jean Valjean at The Muny in the St. Louis in their production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, alongside Norm Lewis as Javert. Panaro won a St. Louis Theater Circle Award for his portrayal of Valjean. Afterwards, he returned to the Majestic stage on August 26, starring opposite Mary Michael Patterson as Christine Daaé. Panaro&#x27;s final performance as the Phantom was May 3. His former co-star in &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, Norm Lewis, succeeded him in the role.

Beginning August 29, he assumed the lead from Norm Lewis in the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; at the Barrow Street Theater. He played the role through February 25, 2018. In 2011 he was the announced &#x27;Maxim de Winter&#x27; in a later to be cancelled Broadway version of &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

<text>Borssele is a village in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Borsele, and lies about 12 km east of Vlissingen. The municipality name is spelled with a single &quot;s&quot; while the name of the town is spelled with a double &quot;s&quot;.

Borssele is home to the Borssele nuclear power plant.

The village&#x27;s near-symmetrical street plan from 1616 follows a rectangular design with four streets all leading to a central square (called the &quot;Plein&quot;). The streets are named according to their cardinal directions. 

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 976 as Brumsale, and means &quot;single room house on the bank&quot;. The island of Borssele was lost in 1530 and only the hill on which the castle had stood remained. The village of Monster which was located on the island had been destroyed. In 1615, a dike was built to reclaim the land. Borssele is a planned &quot;polder&quot; village which was designed in 1616 by Cornelis Adriaensz Soetwater.

The Dutch Reformed church was built between 1849 and 1852 in neoclassic style. The Vliedberg which is also called &quot;Mountain of Troy&quot; is the remnant of the 11th century castle.

Borssele was home to 819 people in 1840. In 1927, a railway station was built on the Goes to Hoedekenskerke railway line. It closed in 1934.

==Energy==

The village is the site of the Netherlands&#x27; only commercial nuclear power plant, the 485 MW Borssele nuclear power plant. 

A nearby area in the North Sea contains the Borssele Offshore Wind Farms, and is scheduled for more offshore wind farm development. The first two stages for a combined 700-760 MegaWatt capacity was awarded to DONG Energy (among 36-38 bidders) in July 2016 at a price of 7.27 euro cent per kilowatt hour for 15 years, after which it would produce at market conditions. The price will not be adjusted for inflation. TenneT receives a further €14/MWh (1.4 c/kWh) for transmission, giving a total price of €87/MWh (8.7 c/kWh). 

Experts view the price as unusually low (the lowest price was 10.3 c/kWh), and consider finance, high wind of 9.5 m/s and scaling as main drivers for the decreased price. Proximity to shore also means the project can use alternating current transformer and cables to shore, instead of direct current, decreasing the cost. The wind farm operators only handle the farms, as TenneT handles the transmission. The 752 MW Borssele 1 &amp; 2 was commissioned in late 2020. In April 2021, Ørsted agreed to sell half of the facility to Norges Bank Investment Management. One turbine caught fire in October 2021. Most of the wind farm continued operating. The facility is serviced by a surface effect ship.

Two more stages with a further 680-740 MW went on auction on 29 September 2016 with 26 bids from 7 consortia. The auction was won by the Blauwwind II c.v. consortium with 8MW Vestas-Mitsubishi turbines, at a price of 5.45 c/kWh. The total subsidy is estimated at €300 million, down from the expected €5 billion.

<text>The V Bomber Command is an inactive United States Army Air Forces unit. It was last assigned to Fifth Air Force, based at Irumagawa AB, Japan. It was inactivated on 31 May 1946.

During World War II the unit initially controlled Fifth Air Force bomber units in the Philippines. It was largely destroyed in the Battle of the Philippines, and withdrew to Australia at the end of December 1941, although elements of some units remained in the Philippines until April 1942. Re-equipped, the command provided command and control authority of Army Air Force bombardment organizations within the Fifth Air Force Area of Responsibility (AOR).

Afterward, served with the occupation force in Japan before being inactivated in 1946.

==History==
Participated in the defense of the Philippines in December 1941. Late in December the remaining bombers and some men were evacuated to Australia, and in January 1942 they were moved to Java to help delay the Japanese advance in the Netherlands Indies.

The command ceased to function in March 1942 (the AAF bombardment organizations in the Southwest Pacific being under the control of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) and later Allied Air Forces). Headquarters was remanned in September 1942 and shortly afterward it assumed control of AAF bombardment groups in Australia and New Guinea.

The command served in combat with Fifth Air Force until the end of the war. Brigadier General Kenneth N. Walker, who was killed during a mission over Rabaul on 5 January 1943, was awarded the Medal of Honor; he had repeatedly taken part in combat missions and had developed an effective technique for bombing when opposed by enemy interceptors and antiaircraft fire. After the war the command became part of the occupation force for Japan. Inactivated on 31 May 1946. Disbanded on 8 October 1948.

<text>Chester Irving Barnard (November 7, 1886 – June 7, 1961) was an American business executive, public administrator, and the author of pioneering work in management theory and organizational studies. His landmark 1938 book, &quot;The Functions of the Executive&quot;, sets out a theory of organization and of the functions of executives in organizations. The book has been widely assigned in university courses in management theory and organizational sociology. Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. According to Barnard, organizations are generally not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: effectiveness and efficiency.

== Biography ==
In his youth, Barnard worked on a farm, then working as a piano tuner, paid his way through high school at the Mount Hermon School. After graduation he studied economics at Harvard University on a scholarship, earning money selling pianos and operating a dance band. He did not obtain his Harvard BA because he did his four-year work in three years and could not complete a science course, but a number of universities later granted him honorary doctorates.

Barnard joined the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&amp;T) in 1909. In 1927, he became president of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. During the Great Depression, he directed the New Jersey state relief system.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1939 and the American Philosophical Society in 1943. He was president of the United Service Organizations (USO), 1942-45. Upon retiring from business, he served as president of the Rockefeller Foundation, 1948–52, and as chairman of the National Science Foundation, 1952-54. End 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research.

== Work ==
Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. It is rare for a firm to last more than a century. Similarly most nations last for less than a century. The only organization that can claim a substantial age is the Roman Catholic Church. According to Barnard, organizations are not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness, is defined the usual way: as being able to accomplish stated goals. In contrast, Barnard&#x27;s meaning of organizational efficiency differed substantially from the conventional use of the word. He defined efficiency of an organization as the degree to which that organization is able to satisfy the motives of the individuals. If an organization satisfies the motives of its members while attaining its explicit goals, cooperation among its members will last.

Barnard was a great admirer of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) and he and Parsons corresponded persistently. The two scholars would send manuscripts for commentary to each other and they would write long letters where they engage in a common theoretical discussion. The first correspondence between Barnard and Parsons began in the end of the 1930s and it persisted essentially to Barnard’s death in 1961.

=== The Functions of the Executive ===

Barnard&#x27;s classic 1938 book, &quot;The Functions of the Executive&quot; discusses, as the title suggests, the functions of the executive, but not from a merely intuitive point of view, but instead deriving them from his conception of cooperative systems.

Barnard summarized the functions of the executive as follows: 
* Establishing and maintaining a system of communication;
* Securing essential services from other members;
* Formulating organizational purposes and objectives.
* To manage people and make sure they do their jobs

=== Authority and incentives ===
Barnard formulated two interesting theories: one of authority and the other of incentives. Both are seen in the context of a communication system grounded in seven essential rules: 
* The channels of communication should be definite;
* Everyone should know of the channels of communication;
* Everyone should have access to the formal channels of communication;
* Lines of communication should be as short and as direct as possible;
* Competence of persons serving as communication centers should be adequate;
* The line of communication should not be interrupted when the organization is functioning;
* Every communication should be authenticated.

Thus, what makes a communication authoritative, rests with the subordinate, rather than with his superior. Barnard&#x27;s perspective had affinities to that of Mary Parker Follett and was very unusual for his time, and that has remained the case down to the present day. He seemed to argue that managers should obtain authority by treating subordinates with respect and competence.

As for incentives, he proposed two ways of convincing subordinates to cooperate: tangible incentives and persuasion. Barnard gives great importance to persuasion, much more than to economic incentives. He described four general, and four specific incentives. 
The specific incentives were:
# Money and other material inducements;
# Personal non-material opportunities for distinction;
# Desirable physical conditions of work;
# Ideal benefactions, such as pride of workmanship etc.

The general incentives were:
# Associated attractiveness (based upon compatibility with associates)
# Adaptation of working conditions to habitual methods and attitudes
# The opportunity for the feeling of enlarged participation in the course of events
# The condition of communing with others (personal comfort with social relations, opportunity for comradeship etc., )

<doc id="1345466" wikidata="Q5096338" url="?curid=1345466" title="Chickenhawk (bird)">
<text>In the United States, chickenhawk or chicken hawk is an unofficial designation for three species of North American hawks in the family [[Accipitridae]]: Cooper&#x27;s hawk (also called a quail hawk), the sharp-shinned hawk, and the Buteo species red-tailed hawk. The term &quot;chicken hawk&quot;, however, is inaccurate. Although Cooper&#x27;s and sharp-shinned hawks do primarily hunt other birds, chickens do not make up a significant part of their diets; red-tailed hawks may opportunistically hunt free-range poultry, but are chiefly predators of mammals such as rodents and rabbits.

Historically, misinterpretation of the name &quot;chicken hawk&quot; has labelled these birds as pests, hence justifying their slaughter. Officially, per the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union&#x27;s list of bird names, the term has become obsolete as applied to birds, but still enjoys widespread colloquial use in rural areas where any of the three species has been seen as a threat to small outdoor animals kept as pets or livestock, especially chickens.

While the term is still widely used by those who keep such animals, it is too ambiguous to be of any scholarly usefulness, especially since the meaning of hawk differs between America and Europe; thus, the term&#x27;s propriety (or lack thereof) depends entirely upon context.

The unofficial names of other raptors that are derived from their supposed prey include: duck hawk (peregrine falcon), sparrowhawk (American kestrel), goshawk (northern goshawk), pigeon hawk (merlin), fish hawk (osprey), cuckoo-hawk, and quail hawk (Cooper&#x27;s hawk).

==In popular culture==
* Henery Hawk is a cartoon character created by Chuck Jones and Robert McKimson in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. The premise of this character was that he was too young to know what a chicken was, hence although having a great deal of energy, was easily tricked into thinking that other animals (usually the Barnyard Dawg or Sylvester) were chickens. The character Foghorn Leghorn was introduced to complement the Henery Hawk character, but quickly eclipsed him in popularity. He, along with the rest of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cast, returned in the latest &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; installment, a sitcom called &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;. In addition to the aforementioned Henery Hawk, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; features chicken hawks Elvis and Pappy. 

* &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Animal Show&quot; featured Armstrong the Chickenhawk (performed by Bill Barretta), who is the show&#x27;s expert on birds.
* An episode of &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;The Hawk&quot;, had a secondary plot dealing with a chicken hawk.

<doc id="1345468" wikidata="Q912785" url="?curid=1345468" title="Kaliber 44">
<text>Kaliber 44 is one of the biggest Polish hip hop groups, formed in 1993 in Katowice. The group is dubbed the most influential Polish hip hop band, while their so-called &quot;hardcore psycho rap&quot; style is the most prominent. As revealed by Abradab in an interview aired on TVP, &quot;the name comes from the time we weren&#x27;t completely sane and played gangsta&quot;. Later on members provided a revised interpretation: first part of the name indicates the of problems the group sings about. The number &quot;44&quot; is a reference to a prophetic poem Dziady written by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz.

&quot;Księga Tajemnicza. Prolog&quot;, released in 1996, was the first Polish hardcore psychorap album and the second one where live-scratching technique was used. Their two other albums – &quot;W 63 minuty dookoła świata&quot; (released in 1998) and &quot;3:44&quot; (released in 2000) were completely devoid of psychorap style, but they were equally popular and lyrically outstanding. Their last album was their last album was titled &quot;Ułamek tarcia&quot; and was released on March 2, 2016. 
== Piotr Łuszcz ==
Soon after release of the second album &quot;W 63 minuty dookoła świata&quot; Magik retired from Kaliber 44, and formed new band called &quot;Paktofonika&quot; together with Sebastian &quot;Rahim&quot; Salbert and Wojciech &quot;Fokus&quot; Alszer.

On 26 December 2000, at around 6:15, &quot;Magik&quot; committed suicide by jumping out of the window of his apartment situated on the ninth floor of the building, in Katowice. At around 6:45, he was pronounced dead in a local hospital, leaving his wife Justyna, and a 3-year-old son, Filip.

<doc id="1345471" wikidata="Q2935792" url="?curid=1345471" title="Canadian Jewish News">
<text>The Canadian Jewish News is a non-profit, national, English-language digital-first media organization that serves Canada&#x27;s Jewish community. A national edition of the newspaper was published for 60 years in Toronto. A weekly Montreal edition in English with some French began its run in 1976. The newspaper announced its closure in 2013 but was able to continue after restructuring and reorganizing. It again announced its closure on April 2, 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada on its finances. Its final weekly print edition was published on April 9, 2020. In December 2020, it announced its return as a digital-first media company with a new president, Bryan Borzykowski.

==History==
The &quot;Canadian Jewish News&quot; was founded by M. J. Nurenberger, a friend of Menachem Begin and supporter of his Herut party, and his wife Dorothy and was first published on Friday, January 1, 1960, and was the first exclusively English-language Jewish newspaper published in Ontario.

The CJN was considered a &quot;provocative&quot; paper into the 1970s but was later considered something of a &quot;lapdog for the community&quot;. The original CJN hewed a line that supported the right in Israeli politics and was critical of the liberal leadership of the Canadian Jewish community at the time as well as community institutions such as B&#x27;nai Brith and the United Jewish Appeal, the latter for its secrecy in how it dispersed money. According to his daughter, Atara Beck, &quot;He believed that a newspaper should be a thorn in the side of the establishment.&quot;

In 1971, following the death of his wife, Nurenberger sold the newspaper for $30,000 to a group of community leaders that included Shoppers Drug Mart founder Murray Koffler and real estate developer Albert Latner and was led by philanthropist and businessman Ray Wolfe. Though independent, the newspaper has been owned, since 1971, by a group of Jewish leaders allied with what was then the Canadian Jewish Congress.

Nurenburger soon regretted his decision, discouraged by the new version of the paper&#x27;s reticence to challenge the community&#x27;s establishment, and started the &quot;Jewish Times&quot; in 1974, which was decidedly more right wing than CJN under its new management, and continued publication into the early 1990s. 

In 1979, the CJN adopted editorial guidelines that prevent articles from criticizing the state of Israel&#x27;s security policies.

By 2013, it had a circulation of 40,000 copies per week.

===Suspension===
On April 22, 2013, the newspaper issued termination notices to its 50 staff and announced that it will cease printing with its June 20 edition due to financial constraints. The publishers sought benefactors to provide funding that would allow the CJN to continue as an exclusively online publication less reliant on advertising.

=== Resumption of publication and second closure ===
On June 14, 2013, the CJN&#x27;s board announced that it would resume publication of its print edition in August 2013 after moving to smaller offices and pending the results of a subscription and advertising drive and various changes to the newspaper&#x27;s business model. Among others, editor Mordechai Ben-Dat and senior staffer and columnist Sheldon Kirshner were let go.

The newspaper was subsequently reorganized under new leadership, and with a drastically reduced staff, beginning in January 2014, with Elizabeth Wolfe, daughter of Ray Wolfe, becoming president and former &quot;Jerusalem Report&quot;, &quot;National Post&quot; and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; journalist Yoni Goldstein becoming the newspaper&#x27;s editor. Goldstein subsequently introduced a more diverse range of contributors to the newspaper. The content of the newly revamped paper was described as &quot;racier&quot; and was more reliant on freelancers.

By 2016, the newspaper&#x27;s subscriptions remained mostly unchanged at 31,000, but Wolfe reported advertising and subscription revenues were enough to invest in new projects.

The paper announced that it would cease publication with its 9 April 2020 issue, with its final circulation estimated at 32,000. It had suffered from financial shortfalls for years, which were exacerbated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Canada on its finances. CJN president Elizabeth Wolfe stated that &quot;The CJN suffered from a pre-existing condition and has been felled by COVID-19.&quot;

=== Revival in digital form ===
In May 2021, The CJN resumed publication once again, for the first time without a physical weekly newspaper. Instead, it returned at a new website, thecjn.ca, which resumed its reporting tradition. The CJN also printed its first magazine for pre-existing subscribers in March 2021, which has since continued as a quarterly.

In addition, they launched a new frequent email newsletter and began several original podcasts. The current list includes &quot;The CJN Daily&quot;, a daily newscast hosted by Ellin Bessner, author of Double Threat; &quot;Bonjour Chai&quot;, hosted by Rabbi Avi Finegold and Phoebe Maltz Bovy, a columnist with The Globe and Mail and the author of The Perils of &quot;Privilege&quot;; &quot;Menschwarmers&quot;, about Jews and sports; &quot;Culturally Jewish&quot;, about Canadian Jewish arts and culture, hosted by actors Ilana Zackon and David Sklar; &quot;Not That Kind of Rabbi&quot;, hosted by CBC veteran Ralph Benmergui; and &quot;Rivkush&quot;, about Jews of colour, hosted by Rivka Campbell. 

In 2024, The CJN debuted its first original audio drama podcast, &quot;Justice: A Holocaust Zombie Story&quot;, about media narratives and generational trauma. The show was produced in association with the Ashkenaz Foundation.

At the end of 2023, longtime editor-in-chief Yoni Goldstein stepped down and was replaced by CEO Michael Weisdorf. The CJN also began hosting live podcast tapings across Toronto. Initial guests included actress Jennifer Podemski and sports broadcaster Michael Landsberg.

== Contributors ==
Notable contributors to the newspaper have included Jacob Elbaz and J. B. Salsberg, who was a featured columnist in the newspaper for several decades until his death in 1998; and Rabbi Gunther Plaut, who contributed a weekly column for many years.

<text>Wayne Cao (born Nguyễn Cảo; December 7, 1946) is a Canadian politician and former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, where he represented the district of Calgary-Fort as a Progressive Conservative. He was first elected in the 1997 provincial election and was re-elected four times. He is perhaps best known as the sponsor of the legislation that led to the enshrining of &quot;Alberta&quot;. In April 2008, he elected as the Legislature&#x27;s Deputy Speaker and Chair of Committees and served in that position for the 27th Legislature. Mr. Cao also served as a member of the Standing Committee on Resource Stewardship.

==Early life==

Cao was born December 7, 1946, in northern Vietnam. He studied engineering, mathematics, and computing science in Saigon and at the University of Auckland and the University of Waterloo. After the Vietnam War, he came to California as a refugee - he boarded an American helicopter just before the fall of Saigon - and settled in Calgary in 1976. He worked for Shell Petroleum for twenty-six years before taking early retirement in 1997 to enter politics. During this time, he also lectured at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.

== Political career ==

Cao first sought public office in the 1997 provincial election, when he ran in the riding of Calgary-Fort as the Progressive Conservative. He was elected handily, and was re-elected in each of the next three elections. He supported Jim Dinning in the 2006 P.C. leadership race.

In April 2008, he was elected by his legislator colleagues as the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, defeating Len Mitzel and Bridget Pastoor in a secret ballot. Cao would announce he would retire from the legislature in February 2015, prior to the 2015 Alberta general election which saw the Progressive Conservative dynasty end when the New Democratic Party would be elected to a majority government. Cao&#x27;s former electoral district Calgary-Fort would elect New Democrat Joe Ceci.

===Legislative initiatives===

Cao has moved a large number of private member&#x27;s bills. Of these, the only one to pass was 2001&#x27;s &quot;Alberta Official Song Act&quot;, which established a contest for the province&#x27;s official song, with the winner to be selected by an all party committee of the legislature. It passed with the support of members from all parties, although Progressive Conservative Rob Renner felt that the province&#x27;s official song should be something that was already known to most Albertans rather than a new song composed for the occasion, and Liberal Hugh MacDonald argued that no official song was necessary, since Alberta already had an &quot;unofficial song&quot;, Alberta Bound (which MacDonald recalled hearing Ian Tyson sing at the closing ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics, although the song, along with Four Strong Winds, was actually sung at the opening ceremonies by Tyson and Gordon Lightfoot, the song&#x27;s composer and singer). The ensuing competition selected &quot;Alberta&quot;, composed by Mary Kieftenbeld, as the province&#x27;s official song. Cao followed this bill with efforts to encourage the translation of O Canada into all languages spoken by Canadians; he composed a Vietnamese version and sang it on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Cao also made headlines in 2007 with the &quot;School (Canadian History Content) Amendment Act&quot;, which would have mandated that 75% of the instructional hours in high school social studies courses be devoted to Canadian history. Several MLAs spoke in opposition to the bill, including Liberals Bill Bonko (who felt, as a former school trustee, that any percentage should be mandated by local school boards) and Harry Chase, New Democrat David Eggen (who suggested that global history was as or more important than Canadian history), and Progressive Conservative Education Minister Ron Liepert (who agreed with Eggen and who extolled the virtues of the recently implemented existing social studies curriculum). Outside of the legislature, Progressive Conservatives Neil Brown and Len Webber expressed reservations about the decision being made at the political, rather than local, level. The legislature adjourned before the bill came to a vote.

Cao also sponsored the &quot;Employment Standards (Parental Leave) Amendment Act&quot;, which would have combined the provisions for adoptive leave and maternity leave and extended them to 27 weeks (Alberta&#x27;s maternity leave provisions were, at the time, the least generous in the country). He first introduced the bill in 1999, but the legislature adjourned before it reached second reading. He re-introduced it in 2000, when several MLAs, including Liberals Don Massey, Laurie Blakeman, Linda Sloan, and Percy Wickman and Progressive Conservatives Moe Amery, Karen Kryczka, and Mary Anne Jablonski, spoke in support of the bill on second reading. Only Shiraz Shariff spoke against, citing concerns that the business community hadn&#x27;t been sufficiently consulted. The bill passed second reading with 34 votes in favour and four (Gary Friedel, Richard Magnus, Barry McFarland, and Rob Renner) against. However, the legislature adjourned while the bill was still in committee.

In 2008, Cao sponsored the &quot;Alberta Volunteer Service Medal Act&quot;, which would have established a medal for exceptional volunteers. It received bipartisan support from Progressive Conservatives Jonathan Denis, Carl Benito, Neil Brown, and Greg Weadick and Liberals Hugh MacDonald and Darshan Kang, but was ultimately hoisted on a motion from Progressive Conservative Fred Horne. The bill&#x27;s opponents included Liberal Harry B. Chase (who felt that the government&#x27;s role in volunteer recognition should come in the form of support, rather than in the form of after-the-fact recognition) and Progressive Conservatives Richard Marz (who argued that medals should be restricted to those who had risked their lives), Heather Forsyth (who was concerned by the level of bureaucracy in the bill), George Rogers (who suggested that it duplicated existing government programs), Ray Prins (who was concerned that by singling out individual volunteers it would demean the contributions of those who weren&#x27;t recognized), and Doug Griffiths (who echoed Rogers&#x27; arguments and also expressed concern that the proposed award would have a built in bias in favour of volunteers with large organizations).

His other private member&#x27;s bills have included 1997&#x27;s &quot;Highway Traffic Amendment Act&quot;, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Environmental Protection and Enhancement (Residential Land Disclosure) Amendment Act&quot;, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Financial Summit Act&quot;, and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Government Accountability (Identification of Expenditures) Amendment Act&quot;, none of which reached second reading.

In addition to his private member&#x27;s bills, Cao has sponsored a government bill, the &quot;Tobacco Tax Amendment Act&quot; of 2003. The bill was in response to an increase in the number of Albertans buying tobacco products out of province, after the government imposed taxes on the import of tobacco products to Alberta that saw taxes on such goods more than double. It passed after little debate. Cao also sponsored a successful private bill in 1998, the &quot;Tanya Marie Bryant Adoption Termination Act&quot;.

==Personal life==

Cao is married to Kim Hoang, an engineer and banker. The pair have three sons: William (a lawyer), Winston (an engineer), and Willis (a scientist). They also have three grandchildren: Dylan from Mimi/William, Maxwell and Chelsea from Sarah/Winston.

He identifies Confucius and Winston Churchill as his political heroes.

<text>Popjustice is a music website founded in 2000 by UK freelance music journalist Peter Robinson, who has worked for &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Attitude&quot; and many others. It is composed of the work of editor Robinson, features editor Michael Cragg, and a host of contributors.

The website seeks to celebrate commercial popular music and does this using humour, user interaction, and contacts within the music industry. Its writing style has been compared favourably by a number of critics to that of the now defunct &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine, in that it mixes a passion for pop music with a surreal and biting wit.

The website was relaunched in January 2006 with more features, music downloads and online shop. In November 2006 Popjustice won a Record of the Day PR &amp; Music Journalism Award in the Best Online Music Publication category, with another individual award going to Peter Robinson in the Breaking Music: Writer Of The Year category.

After a semi-hiatus since mid-2021 and two posts during 2022, , the journalism component of the website has migrated to Substack, with the Popjustice forums remaining at the original location.

== Popjustice £20 Music Prize ==

In 2003, Popjustice set up the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, in order to find the best British pop single of the year, as a parody of the Mercury Music Prize and held on the same night, usually at a bar in Central London.

== Popjustice books and albums ==
A series of Popjustice books called &quot;Popjustice Idols&quot; were published in March 2006. They are illustrated by David Whittle. Drawing inspiration from Roger Hargreaves&#x27;s &quot;Mr Men&quot; books, these feature amusing looks at the lives of pop stars. The initial titles were Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Robbie Williams and Eminem with a Take That version released in April 2006. Four more were released in November 2006 featuring Pete Doherty, Elton John, Britney Spears and Michael Jackson. A compilation album was also released in October 2006, titled &quot;&quot;.

<text>Viscount Templewood, of Chelsea in the County of Middlesex, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 14 July 1944 for the Conservative politician and former Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, 2nd Baronet. The Hoare Baronetcy, of Sidestrand Hall in the County of Norfolk, had been created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 7 August 1899 for his father Samuel Hoare, who represented Norwich in the House of Commons. Both titles became extinct on Lord Templewood&#x27;s death in 1959.

The name Templewood was that of a country house at Sidestrand. Templewood was built in 1938 by architects John Seely and Paul Paget.

<text>USS &quot;Cairo&quot; is the lead ship of the City-class casemate ironclads built at the beginning of the American Civil War to serve as river gunboats.

&quot;Cairo&quot; is named for Cairo, Illinois. In June 1862, she captured the Confederate garrison of Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River, enabling Union forces to occupy Memphis. As part of the Yazoo Pass Expedition, she was sunk on 12 December 1862, while clearing mines for the attack on Haines Bluff. &quot;Cairo&quot; was the first ship ever to be sunk by a mine remotely detonated by hand.

The remains of &quot;Cairo&quot; can be viewed at Vicksburg National Military Park with a museum of its weapons and naval stores.

==Service in the American Civil War==

&quot;Cairo&quot; was built by James Eads and Co., Mound City, Illinois, in 1861, under contract to the United States Department of War. She was commissioned as part of the Union Army&#x27;s Western Gunboat Flotilla, which had US Navy Lieutenant James M. Prichett in command.

&quot;Cairo&quot; served with the Army&#x27;s Western Gunboat Flotilla on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, and their tributaries until she was transferred to the Navy on 1 October 1862, with the other river gunboats. She was commanded by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote.

Active in the occupation of Clarksville, Tennessee, 17 February 1862, and of Nashville, Tennessee, 25 February, &quot;Cairo&quot; stood down the river on 12 April, escorting mortar boats to begin the lengthy operations against Fort Pillow. An engagement with Confederate gunboats at Plum Point Bend on 11 May, marked a series of blockading and bombardment activities which culminated into the abandonment of the fort by its defenders on 4 June.

On 6 June 1862, two days later, &quot;Cairo&quot; joined in the triumph of seven Union ships and a tug over eight Confederate gunboats off Memphis. Five of the opposing gunboats were sunk or run ashore during this action; two were seriously damaged, and one managed to escape. That night, Union forces occupied the city. &quot;Cairo&quot; returned to patrol on the Mississippi until 21 November, when she joined the Yazoo Pass Expedition.

On 12 December 1862, while clearing mines from the river, preparatory to the attack on Haines Bluff, &quot;Cairo&quot; struck a &quot;torpedo&quot; (or naval mine) detonated by volunteers hidden behind the river bank and sank in 12 minutes. There were no casualties.

==Armament==
Like many of the Mississippi theatre ironclads, &quot;Cairo&quot; had her armament changed over the life of the vessel. To speed up her entrance into the service, &quot;Cairo&quot; and the other City-class ships were fitted with whatever weapons were on hand, then had their weapons upgraded as new pieces were made available. Though the smoothbore Dahlgren guns were fairly modern, most of the other original weapons were antiquated, such as the 32-pounders, or modified, such as the 42-pounder &quot;rifles&quot;. These were old smoothbores that had been made into rifles. The 42-pounder weapons were of particular concern to military commanders because they were structurally weaker and more prone to exploding than purpose-built rifled cannons. Additionally, the close confines of combat on the rivers greatly increased the threat of boarding parties. The 12-pounder howitzer was equipped to address that concern and was not used in regular combat.

==Discovery of the wreck==
Over the years, the gunboat was forgotten and slowly covered by silt and sand. Impacted in mud, &quot;Cairo&quot; became a time capsule in which her unique, historical artifacts were preserved against corrosion and biological degradation. Her whereabouts became a matter of speculation, as members of the crew had died and local residents were unsure of the location.

Studying Civil War maps, Edwin C. Bearss of Vicksburg National Military Park set out to search for the lost ship using a simple magnetic compass. With the assistance of Don Jacks and Warren Grabau, the ship was found in 1956. In 1960, numerous artifacts were recovered from the ship, including the pilothouse and an 8-inch cannon, both preserved by the Yazoo River mud.

With support from the State of Mississippi, State Senator H.V. Cooper and local authorities, the gunboat was salvaged from the bottom of the river.

==Salvage and museum==
Hopes of lifting the ironclad and her cargo of artifacts intact were crushed in October 1964, when the 3-inch cables being used to lift &quot;Cairo&quot; cut deeply into its wooden hull. It then became a question of saving as much of the vessel as possible. A decision was made to cut &quot;Cairo&quot; into three sections. By the end of December, the battered remains were put on barges and towed to Vicksburg, Mississippi. In the summer of 1965, the barges carrying &quot;Cairo&quot; were towed to Ingalls Shipyard on the Gulf Coast in Pascagoula, Mississippi. There the armor was removed, cleaned, and stored. The two engines were taken apart, cleaned and reassembled. Sections of the hull were braced internally and a sprinkler system was operated continually to keep the white oak structural timbers from and . On 3 September 1971, &quot;Cairo&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1972, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation authorizing the National Park Service to accept the title to &quot;Cairo&quot; and restore the gunboat for display in Vicksburg National Military Park. Delays in funding the project halted progress until June 1977, when the vessel was transported to the park and partially reconstructed on a concrete foundation near the Vicksburg National Cemetery. A shelter to cover the vessel was completed in October 1980, with the museum opening in November. The original space-frame shelter has since been replaced by a tension-fabric system to provide better cover.

The recovery of artifacts from &quot;Cairo&quot; revealed a treasure trove of weapons, ammunition, naval stores, and personal gear of the sailors who served on board. The gunboat and its artifacts can now be seen along the tour road at the USS &quot;Cairo&quot; Museum. These include a sailor&#x27;s rope knife in good condition.

Since salvage, &quot;Cairo&quot; has suffered degradation due to exposure to the elements, bird droppings, and vandalism. There are only four surviving Civil War-era ironclads in existence: , , USS &quot;Cairo&quot;, and CSS &quot;Muscogee&quot;.

<doc id="1345505" wikidata="Q4632222" url="?curid=1345505" title="25th Alberta Legislature">
<text>The 25th Alberta Legislative Assembly was in session from April 9, 2001, to October 25, 2004, with the membership of the assembly determined by the results of the 2001 Alberta general election held on March 12, 2001. The Legislature officially resumed on April 9, 2001, and continued until the fourth session was prorogued and dissolved on October 25, 2004, prior to the 2004 Alberta general election on November 22, 2004.

Alberta&#x27;s twenty-fifth government was controlled by the majority Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, led by Premier Ralph Klein. The Official Opposition was led by Ken Nicol of the Liberal Party. The Speaker was Ken Kowalski. With the exception of the three MLAs listed below, all members held their seats until dissolution of the legislature.

==History==
The 25th Legislative Assembly was ushered in with a massive Progressive Conservative majority, with Alberta being dubbed Ralph&#x27;s World following the 2001 general election. The official opposition Liberals began a turbulent period that would see the party go through four leaders.

The third party Alberta New Democrats also changed leaders in July 2004 with the retirement of Raj Pannu and choice of Brian Mason as new leader.

Towards the end of the legislature for the first time since 1985, a new party caucus was formed. Edmonton-Norwood MLA Gary Masyk would cross the floor to the Alberta Alliance which had been formed in 2002 and registered in 2003 creating the caucus for that party. His reason for leaving was the Premier&#x27;s interference in the 2004 federal election that coincided with a sharp decline in poll numbers that kept the federal Conservatives from winning the election. His electoral district was also abolished in the 2004 Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution.

Support the Progressive Conservatives softened through the reign of the Assembly but still remained high during the 2004 general election.

==Bills==
===&quot;Adult Interdependent Relationships Act&quot;===
The &quot;Adult Interdependent Relationships Act&quot; (S.A. 2002, c. A-4.5) was passed by the Alberta Legislature on December 4, 2002, and proclaimed in force on June 1, 2003. The act did not amend Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, but did amend 69 other Alberta laws following the 1999 landmark Supreme Court of Canada ruling in the case of &quot;M. v. H.&quot;, which essentially required all provinces to extend the benefits of common-law marriage to same-sex couples, under the equality provisions of Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Owing to the conservative political climate in the province, the government of Alberta was slow to respond, but in 2000 Alberta did amend the provincial Marriage Act to specifically limit marriage to different-sex couples. The Act was based on the January 2002 Alberta Law Reform Institute recommendations in &quot;Recognition of Rights and Obligations in Same-Sex Relationships&quot; which was funded in part by the provincial government.

===&quot;Electoral Divisions Act&quot;===
The &quot;Electoral Divisions Act&quot; (S.A. 2003, c. E-4.1) was passed by the Alberta Legislature during the third session, and received Royal Assent on May 15, 2003. The Act implemented the recommendations of the Final Report of the Electoral Boundaries Commission, chaired by former Social Credit MLA and Alberta&#x27;s Ethics Commissioner Robert Curtis Clark which delineated the new electoral boundaries for the upcoming 2004 Alberta general election and the 26th Alberta Legislature. The new electoral boundaries retained a total of 83 seats, with Calgary gaining two seats, Edmonton losing one seat, and one of the &quot;special consideration&quot; divisions (due to its isolation, it is allowed to have a population below 75% of the provincial average) was eliminated, leaving Dunvegan-Central Peace the last remaining special consideration district.

<text>The 26th Alberta Legislative Assembly was in session from March 1, 2005, to February 4, 2008, with the membership of the assembly determined by the results of the 2004 Alberta general election held on November 22, 2004. The Legislature officially resumed on March 1, 2005, and continued until the fourth session was prorogued and dissolved on February 4, 2008, prior to the 2008 Alberta general election on March 3, 2008.

Alberta&#x27;s twenty-sixth government was controlled by the majority Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, led by Premier Ralph Klein until his resignation on December 24, 2006, after which he was succeeded by Ed Stelmach. The Official Opposition was led by Kevin Taft of the Liberal Party. The Speaker was Ken Kowalski. In the list below, cabinet members&#x27; names are bolded; leaders of official parties are italicized.

This legislature had the distinction of being addressed by Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, to help celebrate Alberta&#x27;s centennial.

==Party standings after 26th General Elections==

==Members of the 26th Legislature by district==
* The Alberta Court of Appeal declared Thomas Lukaszuk the victor more than two months after the election. The election-night vote count had given Chris Kibermanis of the Liberals a five-vote win, but the judicial recount gave Lukaszuk a three-vote margin of victory.
* A party requires four seats to have official party status in the legislature. Parties with fewer than four seats are not entitled to party funding although their members will usually be permitted to sit together in the chamber.

==Notable events==
* The province&#x27;s centennial occurred during the 26th Legislature, on September 1, 2005. Earlier that year, on May 24, 2005, Elizabeth II made an official visit to the province in commemoration of the centennial.
* On March 1, 2006, premier Ralph Klein announced a series of controversial health care reforms which involved allowing greater levels of privatization in Alberta&#x27;s public health care system. Later that day, the premier received significant media attention after throwing a book at a 17-year-old page.
* On March 15, 2006, and throughout the year, the Legislative Assembly celebrated the centennial of the first sitting of the Legislature.
* On April 6, 2006, Ted Morton introduced the controversial Bill 208, Protection of Fundamental Freedoms (Marriage) Statutes Amendment Act, 2006. Critics maintained that the bill removed limitations on free speech where homosexual individuals were concerned, potentially removing recourse for verbal abuse and discrimination. The bill died on the order paper on May 18, 2006.

<text>High Plains Drifter is a 1973 American Western film directed by Clint Eastwood, written by Ernest Tidyman, and produced by Robert Daley for The Malpaso Company and Universal Pictures. The film stars Eastwood as a mysterious stranger who metes out justice in a corrupt frontier mining town. The film was influenced by the work of Eastwood&#x27;s two major collaborators, film directors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. In addition to Eastwood, the film also co-stars Verna Bloom, Mariana Hill, Mitchell Ryan, Jack Ging, and Stefan Gierasch.

The film was shot on location on the shores of Mono Lake, California. Dee Barton wrote the film score. The film was critically acclaimed at the time of its initial release and remains popular.

==Plot==
A mysterious, unnamed stranger rides out of the desert into the isolated mining town of Lago in the American Old West. Three gunmen hired to protect the town taunt and threaten him; he kills all three with little effort. When the attractive, blonde townswoman Callie Travers flirtatiously insults him, he rapes her in the livery stable. That night, in his hotel room, the Stranger dreams of Jim Duncan, a U.S. Marshal, being whipped to death by outlaws Stacey Bridges and brothers Dan and Cole Carlin, as Lago&#x27;s citizens watch in silence.

The next day, Callie shoots at the Stranger while he is bathing. Ducking under the water, the Stranger emerges uninjured. Lago&#x27;s town council, needing to replace the three gunmen, offer the Stranger anything he wants to protect the town from Bridges and the Carlins, who will soon be released from prison. It is gradually revealed that the townspeople hired the outlaws to murder Duncan when he discovered that the local gold mine was illegally dug on government-owned land and would have to be closed, destroying the town&#x27;s livelihood. The townspeople then conspired to frame the outlaws for stealing gold as a means to avoid paying them, and they have vowed revenge.

The Stranger accepts the job and takes full advantage of the deal: He appoints a downtrodden dwarf named Mordecai as both sheriff and mayor, provides a Native American and his children with blankets and candy when the shopkeeper refuses to serve them, gets a new saddle and boots, and forces the saloon to serve everyone free drinks. He later orders the hotel owners, Lewis and Sarah Belding, and all the other guests to vacate the premises, leaving himself as its sole occupant.

Callie and several men, including Morgan Allen, decide to kill the Stranger. After having sex with him in his room, Callie slips out as the men enter. As they unknowingly beat a dummy in the bed, the Stranger tosses a stick of dynamite into the room, destroying most of the hotel, killing two men. He then shoots two of his attackers dead outside, as Morgan flees, wounded. The Stranger drags Sarah, kicking and screaming, into her bedroom (the only room in the hotel not damaged) where they have sex. The next morning, Sarah tells the Stranger that Duncan cannot rest in peace because the town buried him in an unmarked grave. She then tells her husband that she has had enough of the town and is leaving him and the town.

The Stranger assembles a group of citizens to defend the town and has them practice shooting, but soon realizes that none has the necessary skills. To keep the townspeople busy, he orders every building in town painted blood red. He then rides out of town without explanation, following the wounded Morgan. Before he leaves, he paints over the town sign with a single word: &quot;Hell&quot;.

The Stranger finds Bridges and the Carlins, who have just finished off Morgan, and harasses them with dynamite and rifle fire, leading the outlaws to believe the townspeople are responsible. Returning to Lago, the Stranger inspects the preparations — the entire town painted red, armed men on rooftops, picnic tables laden with food and drink, and a big &quot;WELCOME HOME BOYS&quot; banner — then he silently departs again. The outlaws arrive and easily overcome the poor resistance of the townspeople; many defenders are killed, while the survivors are rounded up in the saloon after several buildings in town are set on fire.

The Stranger wraps a bullwhip around the neck of one of the Carlin brothers who is standing just inside the saloon doors, drags him outside and whips him to death, then kills the remaining outlaws one by one. Belding, aiming a shotgun at the Stranger&#x27;s back, is shot dead by Mordecai. The next morning Sarah loads a wagon to head out of town. The Stranger rides past Mordecai in the cemetery. Mordecai comments that he never did know the Stranger&#x27;s real name, to which the Stranger replies: “Yes, you do.” Mordecai’s eyes widen. As the Stranger rides off into the desert, Mordecai stands beside the tombstone he has just finished engraving: &quot;Marshal Jim Duncan, Rest in Peace.&quot; After riding deeper into the desert, the stranger gradually vanishes into the heat waves.

==Production==

Eastwood reportedly liked the offbeat quality of the film&#x27;s original nine-page proposal and approached Universal with the idea of directing it. It is the first Western film that he both directed and starred in. Under a joint production between Malpaso and Universal, the original screenplay was written by Ernest Tidyman, who had won a Best Screenplay Oscar for &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

Tidyman&#x27;s screenplay was inspired by the real-life murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens in 1964, which eyewitnesses reportedly stood by and watched. Holes in the plot were filled in with black humor and allegory, influenced by Sergio Leone. An uncredited rewrite of the script was provided by Dean Riesner, screenwriter of other Eastwood projects.

Universal wanted Eastwood to shoot the feature on its back lot, but Eastwood opted instead to film on location. After scouting locations alone in a pickup truck in Oregon, Nevada and California, he settled on the &quot;highly photogenic&quot; Mono Lake area. Over 50 technicians and construction workers built an entire town—14 houses, a church, and a two-story hotel—in 18 days, using 150,000 feet (45,720 meters) of lumber.

Complete buildings, rather than facades, were built, so that Eastwood could shoot interior scenes on the site. Additional scenes were filmed at Reno, Nevada&#x27;s Winnemucca Lake and California&#x27;s Inyo National Forest. The film was completed in six weeks, two days ahead of schedule, and under budget.

The character of Marshal Duncan was played by Buddy Van Horn, Eastwood&#x27;s long-time stunt double, to suggest that he and the Stranger could be the same person. In an interview, Eastwood said that earlier versions of the script made the Stranger the dead marshal&#x27;s brother. He favored a less explicit and more supernatural interpretation, and excised the reference. The Italian, Spanish, French and German dubbings restored it.

&quot;It&#x27;s just an allegory,&quot; Eastwood said, &quot;a speculation on what happens when they go ahead and kill the sheriff, and somebody comes back and calls the town&#x27;s conscience to bear. There&#x27;s always retribution for your deeds.&quot; The graveyard set featured in the film&#x27;s final scene included tombstones inscribed &quot;Sergio Leone&quot; and &quot;Don Siegel&quot; as a humorous tribute to the two influential directors.

The &#x27;ghost story&#x27; interpretation of the film favoured by Eastwood is hinted at strongly throughout the movie, suggesting that the Stranger may be the ghost of slain Federal Marshall Jim Duncan, returning for vengeance and justice; the beginning and end of the film sees the Stranger mysteriously emerge, apparition-like, as he rides into and out of Lago through a shimmering heat-haze. Upon arriving, the Stranger has a lucid and graphic dream about Jim Duncan&#x27;s death, in which Duncan declares damnation upon the townspeople for not saving his life. The Stranger&#x27;s instructions that all buildings should be painted red and the town&#x27;s name of Lago be replaced by a sign labelled &#x27;HELL&#x27; echoes Duncan&#x27;s dying words that the residents would suffer in Hell for failing to prevent his death. Meanwhile, after spending a night in a hotel bed together, Sarah Belding tells the Stranger of her belief that Jim Duncan cannot rest in peace nor depart the physical realm because he was buried in an unmarked grave. Then, upon the Stranger&#x27;s final departure from Lago, the dwarf Mordecai is seen tending to an unmarked grave which now bears the name Jim Duncan.

==Reception==
Universal released the R-rated &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; in the United States in April 1973, and the film eventually grossed $15.7 million domestically, ultimately making it the sixth-highest grossing Western in North America in the decade of the 1970s and the 20th highest-grossing film released in 1973. The film was well received by many critics, and rates 94% positive on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. On Metacritic the film has a score 69% based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;part ghost story, part revenge Western, more than a little silly, and often quite entertaining in a way that may make you wonder if you lost your good sense.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;What does work very well indeed is Eastwood&#x27;s presence, personal style, and direction. Though his laconic sense of humor often drags out the pacing of the movie, Eastwood uses his camera with intelligence and flair.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a nervously humorous, self-conscious near satire on the prototype Clint Eastwood formula of the avenging mysterious stranger. Ernest Tidyman&#x27;s script has some raw violence for the kinks, some dumb humor for audience relief, and lots of arch characterizations befitting the serio-comic-strip nature of the plot.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it: &quot;a stylized, allegorical western of much chillingly paranoid atmosphere and considerable sardonic humor that confirms Eastwood&#x27;s directorial flair. It&#x27;s also a pretty violent business that won&#x27;t disappoint the millions who flocked to the Leone westerns.&quot; Tom Zito of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an enjoyable, well-constructed work that suffers only from a slightly tedious tone that makes the film seem longer than its 105 minutes.&quot;

The film had its share of detractors. Some critics thought Eastwood&#x27;s directing derivative; Arthur Knight in &quot;Saturday Review&quot; remarked that Eastwood had &quot;absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society&quot;. Jon Landau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concurred, noting &quot;thematic shallowness&quot; and &quot;verbal archness&quot;; but he expressed approval of the dramatic scenery and cinematography.

Nigel Andrews of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;after &quot;Play Misty For Me&quot;, &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; emerges as a disappointingly sterile exercise in style, suggesting that the first thing Eastwood should do as a director is forget the lessons he has learned from other film-makers and start to forge a convincing style of his own.&quot; John Wayne criticized the film&#x27;s iconoclastic approach; in a letter to Eastwood, he wrote: &quot;That isn&#x27;t what the West was all about. That isn&#x27;t the American people who settled this country.&quot;

The film was recognized by American Film Institute in 2008 on AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 in the category &quot;Nominated Western Film&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; was first released on DVD by Universal Studios Home Video on February 24, 1998. It made its Blu-ray debut on October 15, 2013 by Universal Studios, with a 4K scan of the original camera negative along with a newly created 5.1 audio track. It was reissued on Blu-ray on October 27, 2020, by Kino Lorber with commentary tracks and new interviews but uses the same 2013 transfer as before. On November 22, 2022, it was released on 4K UHD by Kino Lorber with a newly remastered 4K transfer, but with the exact same special features as their 2020 release. However, some minor controversy occurred, as a result of them choosing to leave off the original theatrical mono mix, as they did with their 2020 release, instead having a stereo downmix of the 5.1 track.

<text>Ian Ross (born April 8, 1968 in McCreary, Manitoba, Canada), the son of Grace and Raymond Ross, is a Métis / Ojibwe playwright.

== Life ==
Ross earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in film and a minor in theatre from the University of Manitoba in 1992. He spent the first five years of his life in the Métis community of Kinosota, Manitoba before moving to Winnipeg, which he currently now calls his home. Ross has written for theatre, film, television and radio, and has been writing plays for a number of years but is perhaps best known as the creator of &quot;Farewel. FareWel&quot; is Ross’ first professional production, which later won him the 1997 Governor General&#x27;s Award for English Drama, making Ross the first Métis to win the award.

Ross is also the author of a number of plays which include: &quot;The Gap, Heart of a Distant Tribe, Bic Off!, Bereav&#x27;d of Light, An Illustrated History of the Anishinabe,&quot; and a children&#x27;s play called, &quot;Baloney!&quot; Ross&#x27; plays have been produced by the Manitoba Theatre for Young People, Black Hole Theatre Company, and the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival. Ross has written many segments for CBC, but is well known for his humorous segment on the radio as &quot;Joe from Winnipeg&quot;. After &quot;Joe from Winnipeg&quot; aired, episodes were later published in two books, &quot;The Book of Joe&quot; and &quot;Joe from Winnipeg&quot;.
&quot;FareWel,&quot; is fictional comedy about a group of First Nations that are forced to take control of their own lives, when their chief leaves to gamble in Las Vegas. As the Reserve is declaring self-government and the people are no longer receiving their welfare cheques, a new chief is elected by manipulation. The text was published by Scirocco 1997, and the play premiered at Prairie Theatre Exchange (PTE) in 1996, and was remounted at PTE in 1998. &quot;FareWel&quot; was later invited to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2001.

&quot;The Gap&quot; is a play that portrays a love relationship between an Indigenous man and a French woman set against the backdrop of a flood and premiered at Prairie Theatre Exchange in 2001.

&quot;An Illustrated History of the Anishinabe&quot;, is a three-person play that started in Winnipeg for only eight days of school performances. The play uses a healthy amount of comedy to tell the story of First Nations history on the Prairies. Anishinabe is a word the prairie Ojibwa people used to describe themselves.

<doc id="1345530" wikidata="Q5547625" url="?curid=1345530" title="Malouf syndrome">
<text>Malouf syndrome (also known as &quot;congestive cardiomyopathy-hypergonadotropic hypogonadism syndrome&quot;) is a congenital disorder that causes one or more of the following symptoms: intellectual disability, ovarian dysgenesis, congestive cardiomyopathy, broad nasal base, blepharoptosis, and bone abnormalities, and occasionally marfanoid habitus (tall stature with long and thin limbs, little subcutaneous fat, arachnodactyly, joint hyperextension, narrow face, small chin, large testes, and hypotonia).

This congenital disease was first classified in 1985 by Dr. Joe Malouf, who performed a case study on two sisters that displayed this rare syndrome. The study consisted of two sisters that presented with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, dilated cardiomyopathy, blepharoptosis, and a broad nasal base. Upon further analysis of their genetic lineage, it was found that the parents of the sisters were first-degree cousins; Malouf then classified the syndrome as a familial disorder. In 1992, a new case study of an 18-year-old female conducted by Narahara et al. resulted in similar findings as Malouf. Although the prevalence of Malouf syndrome is unknown, there are less than 20 affected families discussed in literature. While there is no specific cure for Malouf syndrome, symptoms can be treated. The treatment options are individualized and should be determined by a doctor or specialist.

==Signs and symptoms==

The main symptoms of this disease are hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and cardiomyopathy, whose coexistence is extremely rare. It is characterized by a combination of features that can affect the skeletal, cardiovascular, and skin systems.

Symptoms:
* Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism: impaired testicular function. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism can be acquired or can be present from birth.
* Cardiomyopathy: muscle or electrical dysfunction of the heart which often leads to progressive heart failure. There are many different types of cardiomyopathies. Cardiomyopathies are usually asymptomatic in the early stages, but can have similar symptoms to heart failure such as shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, orthopnea, dyspnea, and edema. Treatment is based on the patients symptoms and on whether it is obstructive or nonobstructive. There are many different approaches to treatment strategies for cardiomyopathies.
* Dilated cardiomyopathy: identified by presence of left ventricular dilation and contractile dysfunction. Genetic mutations such as Malouf syndrome account for 35% of the cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. Symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy are similar to congestive heart failure.
* Blepharoptosis: a common eyelid disorder which causes an abnormally low or drooping of one or both upper eyelids. Symptoms of blepharoptosis range from an asymptomatic cosmetic effect to significant visual deficits. There are several different classifications of blepharoptosis.
* Broad nasal base: while this may be perfectly normal in certain individuals, it can also be a symptom of a congenital disorder
* Marfanoid habitus: a congenital syndrome that is physically characterized by long limbs and a flat face that may resemble Marfan syndrome along with learning and motor disabilities
* Metabolic abnormalities
* Thyroid hemiagenisis: a rare congenital abnormality of the thyroid gland characterized by the absence of one lobe 
* Aged appearance of the feet
* Diabetes mellitus: chronic metabolic disorder reducing the ability for and individual to regulate the level of glucose in their blood stream. There are several classifications of diabetes mellitus. These classifications include type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and steroid-induced diabetes. The initial treatment to diabetes mellitus is through lifestyle modifications through physical activity and diet changes. When these non-pharmacologic approaches do not result in normalization of the metabolic abnormalities, there are several different pharmacologic therapies that are available.
* Collagenoma: rare collections of malformed cells that are densely composed of collagen This is usually treated by resection or electrical cauterizations, but it varies from patient to patient.
* Ovarian dysgenesis (female): females with ovarian dysgenesis do not have germ cells. They do however have the female phenotype, but they lack sexual characteristics.
* Hypoplastic genitalia: underdeveloped genitalia
* Undescended testis (males): also known as cryptorchidism. Undescended testis is a condition in which the testicles fail to descend into the scrotum. It is a common birth defect and surgical treatment is the recommended option. For children, the surgery is an orchiopexy. For adults with undescended testis, the treatment approach is an orchiectomy in which one or both testicles are surgically removed. If left untreated, fertility disorders may occur.
* Micropenis (males): clinically diagnosed as 2.5 standard deviations of the mean in a patient with normal internal and external male genitalia.
* Small testis (males): clinically defined as testes that are smaller than the 50th percentile for age.

Note: it is possible that males with Malouf syndrome display cardiomyopathy but not testicular dysgenesis

== Genetics ==
Malouf syndrome involves an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in that it is a recessive trait that is inherited. It is caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the LMNA gene located on chromosome 1 (1q22). The person inherits two copies of this mutation from both of the parents - meaning both parents are carriers of this mutation - leading to the development of the syndrome. The LMNA gene encodes for lamin A and lamin C which are important proteins produced by almost every type of cell in the body. The lamin family of proteins are components of the nuclear lamina that consists of a protein network within the inner nuclear membrane that determine nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression. Mutations in this gene can lead to several diseases besides Malouf syndrome, such as familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, therefore making it harder to distinguish whether a patient is displaying signs of Malouf syndrome or some other disease. The LMNA mutation can show up in many different tissues including cardiac, skeletal, nervous, adipose, and cutaneous tissue.

The most common heterozygous mutations found in the LMNA gene are a heterozygous de novo ala57-to-pro substitution (A57P), which means the Alanine amino acid at position 57 was substituted by a Proline, resulting from a 584G-C transversion in the LMNA gene and a de novo 176T-C transition in exon 1 leading to a leu59-to-arg (L59R) substitution.

Further genetic research and advanced molecular techniques are necessary to identify the specific genetic defects and pathways involved in Malouf syndrome. The genetic basis of Malouf syndrome remains incompletely understood, contributing to challenges in diagnosis and management.

==Diagnosis==
There is no set criteria used to diagnose Malouf syndrome. Signs and symptoms such as congestive or dilated cardiomyopathy, ovarian dysgenesis in females or primary testicular failure in males, intellectual disability, broad nasal base, blepharoptosis, skin lesions, and skeletal abnormalities are used as a reference to diagnosis this rare disease, and genetic testing of the LMNA gene can serve as a way to confirm a diagnosis.

Malouf syndrome was first diagnosed in 1985 by Dr. Joe Malouf. Dr. Malouf examined two sisters who exhibited congestive cardiomyopathy associated with ovarian dysgenesis, secondary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, bilateral ptosis, and prominent nasal bones. Dr. Malouf noted that this disease is familial - and therefore congenital - as the two sisters were children of first degree cousins.

In 1992, Kouji Narahara examined an 18-year-old girl who displayed the same symptoms seen by Dr. Malouf in his patients. She was described as having delayed intellectual development, mild cardiomegaly, broad nasal base and several signs of Marfan syndrome such as small stature, arachnodactyly, and a large arm span. With further testing, it was found that she had several electrocardiography (ECG) deviations which were concluded to be left-side dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. In addition to cardiomyopathy, many of her reproductive organs were also significantly impacted such as hypoplasia of her uterus, vagina, and fallopian tubes. Dr. Narahara was able to conclude that the girl had Malouf syndrome because it is extremely rare to see gonadal dysgenesis and cardiomyopathy in the same patient, which both his patient and Dr. Malouf&#x27;s patients exhibited.

Diagnosis of this syndrome is sometimes conflicting as the symptoms displayed match those of other diseases such as limb girdle muscular dystrophy, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, Noonan syndrome et cetera. As a result, it has been often questioned as to whether Malouf syndrome truly is a new syndrome that should be accepted.

In particular, Noonan syndrome has been the most significant condition that is considered in the differential diagnosis of Malouf syndrome because of the similarity in its signs and clinical manifestations to those of Malouf syndrome. However, certain fundamental signs and symptoms that are unique only to Malouf syndrome were able to be the distinguishing factor in diagnosis. Some of these signs and symptoms include small stature, abnormalities of the thorax, and a webbed neck.

Despite all of this, providers are strongly encouraged to keep Malouf syndrome in mind with the differential diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy until further evidence is discovered which will lead to a more guided approach to diagnosing patients.
===Differential diagnosis===
Due to the clinically overlapping characteristics, distinguishing Malouf syndrome from other diseases can be challenging. For instance, Malouf syndrome shares similarities with Marfan syndrome, such as a tall and slender build, long limbs, and mitral valve prolapse, making it difficult to differentiate between the two based solely on physical examination. Additionally, other connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and homocystinuria can present with overlapping features such as hypermobility, skin laxity, and cardiovascular anomalies. Therefore, a thorough clinical evaluation, including detailed medical history and, where possible, genetic testing, is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
* Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: The Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a diverse group of genetic connective tissue disorders impacting collagen production and function, characterized by symptoms such as joint hypermobility, tissue fragility, and severe cardiovascular issues like arterial aneurysms and organ rupture. The updated classification now recognizes 13 subtypes, including hypermobile EDS (hEDS), which is distinguished from hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and has a higher risk of systemic complications. While serious cardiovascular problems are common in some EDS types, hEDS typically features only mild, nonprogressive thoracic aortic dilatation and mitral valve prolapse.
* Loeys–Dietz syndrome: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder with systemic involvement, including craniofacial, skeletal, cutaneous, and vascular abnormalities such as arterial tortuosity and aneurysms. The full clinical spectrum of LDS is not yet fully understood due to limited large-scale studies. The prevalence of LDS is also unknown, with current knowledge based on small cohorts and case reports.
* Homocystinuria: Homocystinuria (HCU) is a rare, autosomal recessive trait that results in the inability to metabolize or break down the amino acid methionine. If methionine is unable to be processed, it will build up in the body which can cause serious toxicities such as seizures, high risk of developing blood clotting disorders, and even intellectual disabilities which often align with the symptoms of Malouf syndrome.
* Marfan syndrome: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant systemic connective tissue disorder with variable penetrance, characterized by a range of clinical manifestations. The most serious complications are cardiovascular, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, aortic root dilatation, and aortic dissection. Current efforts focus on improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment based on recent genetic and clinical research findings.

==Management==
Due to the rare nature of the disease, it has been difficult to understand any underlying mechanisms that cause Malouf syndrome. At its current state, there are no specific treatment regimens or therapies to specifically address Malouf syndrome. However, there are ways to manage the symptoms associated with the disease and other lamin-associated dilated cardiomyopathies. Specifically, with respect to Lamin A/C (LMNA) cardiomyopathy, the current treatment follows the standard heart failure regimen. As noted by Dr. Zhang et al., the treatment for standard heart failures in relation to LMNA cardiomyopathy uses &quot;beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, but the specific efficacy in this population is undetermined.&quot; Depending on the patient&#x27;s case, treatment may need a variety of medications to address the symptoms.

Drugs: used to treat dilated cardiomyopathy.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors- This type of medicine enlarges blood vessels and lowers blood pressure in order to improve an individual&#x27;s blood flow. Some of the side effects are dry cough, low blood pressure, low white blood cell count, and kidney or liver problems. Examples: Lisinopril (Zestril), Benazepril (Lotensin).

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)- ARBs are an alternative blood pressure-lowering medication that can be used if a person cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Some of the side effects are hyperkalemia, hypotension, and acute renal failure. Examples: Losartan (Cozaar), Olmesartan (Benicar).

Anticoagulants- This type of drug helps in preventing blood clots but can cause bruising or bleeding. Examples: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), Warfarin (Coumadin).

Sacubitril/Valsartan (Entresto)- This combination drug includes an ARB and ACE inhibitor to help pump blood from your heart to the rest of your body. This drug is mainly for people with chronic heart failure. Common side effects include cough, hyperkalemia, and angioedema.

Beta-blockers- This class of drug slows your heart rate and lowers blood pressure. This medication may also prevent the harmful effects of stress hormones. Some of the side effects of this medication include dizziness, low blood pressure, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance. Examples: Metoprolol (Betaloc or Lopressor), Atenolol (Tenormin).

Diuretics- This type of drug removes excess fluid and salt from the body as well as the lungs, as excess fluid in the body can strain the heart by forcing it to pump harder. Some of the side effects include increased urination and hyperkalemia. Examples: Furosemide (Lasix), Hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide).

Digoxin (Lanoxin)- The purpose of this drug is to strengthen heart muscle contractions and slow down the heartbeat. This drug can reduce heart failure symptoms and improve your ability to be more active. One thing to note is that the use of digoxin requires frequent monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic window. Some of the side effects include rash, headache, hypokalemia, and arrhythmias.

Ivabradine (Corlanor)- This drug restores normal heartbeat by slowing down and regulating the heart rate. It is indicated for the treatment of stable angina pectoris and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction but has seen an increasing role in treating dilated cardiomyopathy due to its improvement of cardiac function. Some side effects of Ivabradine include bradycardia (slow heart rate), atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.

Therapeutic devices: can be surgically implemented to help treat dilated cardiomyopathy.

Biventricular pacemaker- This device sends out electrical signals in order to control contractions between the left and right ventricles. It is used for people who have heart failure and irregular heartbeats.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD)- Although this device does not treat cardiomyopathy itself, it does help prevent arrhythmias, which are commonly caused by cardiomyopathy. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators monitor the heartbeat and send electrical shocks to control any rapid or abnormal rhythms. This device can also serve as a pacemaker which works similarly to keep the heart beating at a normal rate and rhythm).

Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)- This device is attached to the heart and either the abdomen or chest in order to help the weakened heart pump blood. It is usually considered after other approaches have proven unsuccessful and can be used as treatment while waiting for a heart transplant.

Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism hormone replacement therapy:

Hormonal replacement therapy (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, pituitary hormones, et cetera)- This treatment consists of taking medications containing the hormone that the body is lacking to replace the ones that the body no longer produces. These medications can come in the form of pills, patches, gels, or injections.

It is important to note, Malouf syndrome will require regular monitoring. Due to the nature of the disease, and given the potential for progressive symptoms, ongoing monitoring and evaluation by specialists in cardiology, dermatology, and orthopedics are recommended. Genetic counseling may also be beneficial for affected individuals and their families to understand the inheritance pattern and implications.

In summary, Malouf syndrome is a complex disorder requiring a tailored approach to care. As research advances, further understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this condition may lead to more precise diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.

==Epidemiology==

The prevalence of Malouf syndrome is unknown at the moment and has not been fully defined. About 20 families from around the world, whose members have cardiogential syndrome, have been found in literature. However, the prevalence of familial dilated cardiomyopathy ranges from 30 to 50% cases, with 40% having an identifiable genetic cause. Dilated cardiomyopathy was originally classified as a rare disease, but the possibility of a familiar substrate was ignored. Dilated cardiomyopathy was later found to be a major cause of heart failure, especially among young patients. Dilated cardiomyopathy began to be identified as a systemic condition rather than an isolated disease. Even despite these major efforts and contributions, the incidence and prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy remain unknown.

<text>PopCap Games, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Seattle, and a subsidiary of Electronic Arts. The company was founded in 2000 by John Vechey, Brian Fiete and Jason Kapalka.

Originally founded under the name &quot;Sexy Action Cool&quot;, their first title was a strip poker game that served as a revenue stream for future titles. PopCap has developed several games for computers, consoles and mobile devices, with their most popular games being &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, &quot;Peggle&quot;, &quot;Zuma&quot; and &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot; games. PopCap was acquired and became a subsidiary of Electronic Arts on July 12, 2011.

== History ==

PopCap Games was founded by John Vechey, Brian Fiete and Jason Kapalka in 2000. They originally incorporated as &quot;Sexy Action Cool&quot;, a phrase taken from a poster of &quot;Desperado&quot;. Their first title was a strip poker game called &quot;Foxy Poker&quot; and was supposed to serve as a revenue stream for their future titles.
Their first game as PopCap was &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, a gem-swapping game, which was supported on all major platforms and awarded by Computer Gaming World Hall Of Fame in 2002. The company expanded in 2005 with the acquisition of Sprout Games, a Seattle-based casual games developer company like PopCap Games, founded by James Gwertzman. Sprout Games is the creator of the game &quot;Feeding Frenzy&quot;. The Sprout team helped PopCap to make a sequel to the game, &quot;Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown&quot;, with Gwertzman becoming the Director of Business Development at PopCap. In early 2006, PopCap International was opened, based in Dublin, Ireland, working on product localization, mobile games development, marketing, sales and business development.

PopCap began another round of expansion in July 2007 by buying other casual game developers including the creators of an online consumer portal, SpinTop Games. One week prior, the company acquired the Chicago-based development house Retro64, founded by Mike Boeh, which is best known for their retro-arcade action and puzzle titles. After these acquisitions, the PopCap logo was rebranded, dropping the &quot;Games&quot; portion. PopCap&#x27;s premium games list on their website are mixed with other games from other developers/distributors. PopCap hosted several games on PopCap.com and other websites, online and premium, until 2014, when they stopped offering games from their site.

On April 5, 2011, PopCap announced the creation of a new subsidiary, 4th and Battery, started in order to create &quot;edgier&quot; games. Their first creation was the game &quot;Unpleasant Horse&quot;. On July 12, 2011, Electronic Arts announced it was acquiring PopCap for $650 million with an additional $100 million stock option.

On August 21, 2012, PopCap laid off 50 employees in North America in a move to address a shift to mobile and free-to-play games and evaluated ceasing operations of its Dublin studio. The Dublin studio was closed on September 24, 2012.

== Games developed ==

PopCap has developed over 50 games over the past 20 years. Games developed by PopCap include &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot;, &quot;Peggle&quot;, and &quot;Bookworm&quot;.

<doc id="1345537" wikidata="Q7433174" url="?curid=1345537" title="Schwartzian transform">
<text>In computer programming, the Schwartzian transform is a technique used to improve the efficiency of sorting a list of items. This idiom is appropriate for comparison-based sorting when the ordering is actually based on the ordering of a certain property (the &quot;key&quot;) of the elements, where computing that property is an intensive operation that should be performed a minimal number of times. The Schwartzian transform is notable in that it does not use named temporary arrays.

The Schwartzian transform is a version of a Lisp idiom known as decorate-sort-undecorate, which avoids recomputing the sort keys by temporarily associating them with the input items. This approach is similar to , which avoids repeating the calculation of the key corresponding to a specific input value. By comparison, this idiom assures that each input item&#x27;s key is calculated exactly once, which may still result in repeating some calculations if the input data contains duplicate items.

The idiom is named after Randal L. Schwartz, who first demonstrated it in Perl shortly after the release of Perl 5 in 1994. The term &quot;Schwartzian transform&quot; applied solely to Perl programming for a number of years, but it has later been adopted by some users of other languages, such as Python, to refer to similar idioms in those languages. However, the algorithm was already in use in other languages (under no specific name) before it was popularized among the Perl community in the form of that particular idiom by Schwartz. The term &quot;Schwartzian transform&quot; indicates a specific idiom, and &quot;not&quot; the algorithm in general.

For example, to sort the word list (&quot;aaaa&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;aa&quot;) according to word length: first build the list ([&quot;aaaa&quot;,4],[&quot;a&quot;,1],[&quot;aa&quot;,2]), then sort it according to the numeric values getting ([&quot;a&quot;,1],[&quot;aa&quot;,2],[&quot;aaaa&quot;,4]), then strip off the numbers and you get (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;aa&quot;,&quot;aaaa&quot;). That was the algorithm in general, so it does not count as a transform. To make it a true Schwartzian transform, it would be done in Perl like this:

@sorted = map { $_-&gt;[0] }
 sort { $a-&gt;[1] &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;[1] or $a-&gt;[0] cmp $b-&gt;[0] } # Use numeric comparison, fall back to string sort on original
 map { [$_, length($_)] } # Calculate the length of the string
 @unsorted;
==The Perl idiom==
The general form of the Schwartzian transform is:
@sorted = map { $_-&gt;[0] }
 sort { $a-&gt;[1] cmp $b-&gt;[1] or $a-&gt;[0] cmp $b-&gt;[0] }
 map { [$_, foo($_)] }
 @unsorted;
Here codice_1 represents an expression that takes codice_2 (each item of the list in turn) and produces the corresponding value that is to be compared in its stead.

Reading from right to left (or from the bottom to the top):
* the original list codice_3 is fed into a codice_4 operation that wraps each item into a (reference to an anonymous 2-element) array consisting of itself and the calculated value that will determine its sort order (list of item becomes a list of [item, value]);
* then the list of lists produced by codice_4 is fed into codice_6, which sorts it according to the values previously calculated (list of [item, value] ⇒ sorted list of [item, value]);
* finally, another codice_4 operation unwraps the values (from the anonymous array) used for the sorting, producing the items of the original list in the sorted order (sorted list of [item, value] ⇒ sorted list of item).

The use of anonymous arrays ensures that memory will be reclaimed by the Perl garbage collector immediately after the sorting is done.

==Efficiency analysis==
Without the Schwartzian transform, the sorting in the example above would be written in Perl like this:

@sorted = sort { foo($a) cmp foo($b) } @unsorted;
While it is shorter to code, the naive approach here could be much less efficient if the key function (called in the example above) is expensive to compute. This is because the code inside the brackets is evaluated each time two elements need to be compared. An optimal comparison sort performs &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n log n&quot;) comparisons (where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the list), with 2 calls to every comparison, resulting in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n log n&quot;) calls to . In comparison, using the Schwartzian transform, we only make 1 call to per element, at the beginning stage, for a total of &quot;n&quot; calls to .

However, if the function is relatively simple, then the extra overhead of the Schwartzian transform may be unwarranted.

==Example==

For example, to sort a list of files by their modification times, a naive approach might be as follows:

 function naiveCompare(file a, file b) {
 return modificationTime(a) &lt; modificationTime(b)
 
 &quot;// Assume that sort(list, comparisonPredicate) sorts the given list using&quot;
 &quot;// the comparisonPredicate to compare two elements.&quot;
 sortedArray := sort(filesArray, naiveCompare)

Unless the modification times are for each file, this method requires re-computing them every time a file is compared in the sort. Using the Schwartzian transform, the modification time is calculated only once per file.

A Schwartzian transform involves the functional idiom described above, which does not use temporary arrays.

The same algorithm can be written procedurally to better illustrate how it works, but this requires using temporary arrays, and is not a Schwartzian transform. The following example pseudo-code implements the algorithm in this way:

 for each file in filesArray
 insert array(file, modificationTime(file)) at end of transformedArray
 function simpleCompare(array a, array b) {
 return a[2] &lt; b[2]
 
 transformedArray := sort(transformedArray, simpleCompare)
 for each file in transformedArray
 insert file[1] at end of sortedArray

==History==

The first known online appearance of the Schwartzian transform is a December 16, 1994 posting by Randal Schwartz to a thread in comp.unix.shell Usenet newsgroup, crossposted to comp.lang.perl. (The current version of the Perl Timeline is incorrect and refers to a later date in 1995.) The thread began with a question about how to sort a list of lines by their &quot;last&quot; word:

 adjn:Joshua Ng
 adktk:KaLap Timothy Kwong
 admg:Mahalingam Gobieramanan
 admln:Martha L. Nangalama

Schwartz responded with:
#!/usr/bin/perl
require 5; # New features, new bugs!
print
 map { $_-&gt;[0] }
 sort { $a-&gt;[1] cmp $b-&gt;[1] }
 map { [$_, /(\S+)$/] }


This code produces the result:

 admg:Mahalingam Gobieramanan
 adktk:KaLap Timothy Kwong
 admln:Martha L. Nangalama
 adjn:Joshua Ng

Schwartz noted in the post that he was &quot;Speak[ing] with a lisp in Perl&quot;, a reference to the idiom&#x27;s Lisp origins.

The term &quot;Schwartzian transform&quot; itself was coined by Tom Christiansen in a follow-up reply. Later posts by Christiansen made it clear that he had not intended to &quot;name&quot; the construct, but merely to refer to it from the original post: his attempt to finally name it &quot;The Black Transform&quot; did not take hold (&quot;Black&quot; here being a pun on &quot;schwar[t]z&quot;, which means black in German).

==Comparison to other languages==
Some other languages provide a convenient interface to the same optimization as the Schwartzian transform:
* In Python 2.4 and above, both the function and the in-place method take a parameter that allows the user to provide a &quot;key function&quot; (like in the examples above). In Python 3 and above, use of the key function is the only way to specify a custom sort order (the previously supported parameter that allowed the user to provide a &quot;comparison function&quot; was removed). Before Python 2.4, developers would use the lisp-originated decorate–sort–undecorate (DSU) idiom, usually by wrapping the objects in a (sortkey, object) tuple.
* In Ruby 1.8.6 and above, the abstract class (which includes s) contains a method, which allows specifying the &quot;key function&quot; (like in the examples above) as a code block.
* In D 2 and above, the function is available. It might require less temporary data and be faster than the Perl idiom or the decorate–sort–undecorate idiom present in Python and Lisp. This is because sorting is done in-place, and only minimal extra data (one array of transformed elements) is created.
* Racket&#x27;s core codice_6 function accepts a codice_9 keyword argument with a function that extracts a key, and an additional codice_10 requests that the resulting values are cached during sorting. For example, a convenient way to shuffle a list is .
* In PHP 5.3 and above the transform can be implemented by use of , e.g. to work around the limitations of the unstable sort algorithms in PHP.
function spaceballs_sort(array&amp; $a): void
 array_walk($a, function(&amp;$v, $k) { $v = array($v, $k); });
 asort($a);
 array_walk($a, function(&amp;$v, $_) { $v = $v[0]; });
* In Elixir, the and methods allow users to perform a Schwartzian transform for any module that implements the protocol.
* In Raku, one needs to supply a comparator lambda that only takes 1 argument to perform a Schwartzian transform under the hood: @a.sort( { $^a.Str } ) # or shorter: @a.sort(*.Str) would sort on the string representation using a Schwartzian transform, @a.sort( { $^a.Str cmp $^b.Str } ) would do the same converting the elements to compare just before each comparison.
* In Rust, somewhat confusingly, the method does &quot;not&quot; perform a Schwartzian transform as it will not allocate additional storage for the key, it will call the key function for each value for each comparison. The method will compute the keys once per element.
* In Haskell, the codice_11 function from the base library performs a Schwartzian transform.

<text>In structural geology, an anticline is a type of fold that is an arch-like shape and has its oldest beds at its core, whereas a syncline is the inverse of an anticline. A typical anticline is convex up in which the hinge or crest is the location where the curvature is greatest, and the limbs are the sides of the fold that dip away from the hinge. Anticlines can be recognized and differentiated from antiforms by a sequence of rock layers that become progressively older toward the center of the fold. Therefore, if age relationships between various rock strata are unknown, the term antiform should be used.

The progressing age of the rock strata towards the core and uplifted center, are the trademark indications for evidence of anticlines on a geologic map. These formations occur because anticlinal ridges typically develop above thrust faults during crustal deformations. The uplifted core of the fold causes compression of strata that preferentially erodes to a deeper stratigraphic level relative to the topographically lower flanks. Motion along the fault including both shortening and extension of tectonic plates, usually also deforms strata near the fault. This can result in an asymmetrical or overturned fold.

==Terminology of different folds ==
===Antiform===
An antiform can be used to describe any fold that is convex up. It is the relative ages of the rock strata that distinguish anticlines from antiforms.

===Elements===
The &quot;hinge&quot; of an anticline refers to the location where the curvature is greatest, also called the &quot;crest&quot;. The hinge is also the highest point on a stratum along the top of the fold. The &quot;culmination&quot; also refers to the highest point along any geologic structure. The &quot;limbs&quot; are the sides of the fold that display less curvature. The &quot;inflection point&quot; is the area on the limbs where the curvature changes direction.

The &quot;axial surface&quot; is an imaginary plane connecting the hinge of each layer of rock stratum through the cross section of an anticline. If the axial surface is vertical and the angles on each side of the fold are equivalent, then the anticline is symmetrical. If the axial plane is tilted or offset, then the anticline is asymmetrical. An anticline that is cylindrical has a well-defined axial surface, whereas non-cylindrical anticlines are too complex to have a single axial plane.

===Types===
An overturned anticline is an asymmetrical anticline with a limb that has been tilted beyond perpendicular, so that the beds in that limb have basically flipped over and may dip in the same direction on both sides of the axial plane. If the angle between the limbs is large (70–120 degrees), then the fold is an &quot;open&quot; fold, but if the angle between the limbs is small (30 degrees or less), then the fold is a &quot;tight&quot; fold. If an anticline plunges (i.e., the anticline crest is inclined to the Earth&#x27;s surface), it will form &quot;V&quot;s on a geologic map view that point in the direction of plunge. A plunging anticline has a hinge that is not parallel to the earth&#x27;s surface. All anticlines and synclines have some degree of plunge. Periclinal folds are a type of anticlines that have a well-defined, but curved hinge line and are doubly plunging and thus elongate domes.
Folds in which the limbs dip toward the hinge and display a more U-like shape are called &quot;synclines&quot;. They usually flank the sides of anticlines and display opposite characteristics. A syncline&#x27;s oldest rock strata are in its outer limbs; the rocks become progressively younger toward its hinge. A &quot;monocline&quot; is a bend in the strata resulting in a local steepening in only one direction of dip. Monoclines have the shape of a carpet draped over a stairstep.

An anticline that has been more deeply eroded in the center is called a breached or scalped anticline. Breached anticlines can become incised by stream erosion, forming an anticlinal valley.

A structure that plunges in all directions to form a circular or elongate structure is a &quot;dome&quot;. Domes may be created via diapirism from underlying magmatic intrusions or upwardly mobile, mechanically ductile material such as rock salt (salt dome) and shale (shale diapir) that cause deformations and uplift in the surface rock. The Richat Structure of the Sahara is considered a dome that has been laid bare by erosion.

An anticline which plunges at both ends is termed a doubly plunging anticline, and may be formed from multiple deformations, or superposition of two sets of folds. It may also be related to the geometry of the underlying detachment fault and the varying amount of displacement along the surface of that detachment fault.

An anticlinorium is a large anticline in which a series of minor anticlinal folds are superimposed. Examples include the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Purcell Anticlinorium in British Columbia and the Blue Ridge anticlinorium of northern Virginia and Maryland in the Appalachians, or the Nittany Valley in central Pennsylvania.

==Formation processes==

Anticlines are usually developed above thrust faults, so any small compression and motion within the inner crust can have large effects on the upper rock stratum. Stresses developed during mountain building or during other tectonic processes can similarly warp or bend bedding and foliation (or other planar features). The more the underlying fault is tectonically uplifted, the more the strata will be deformed and must adapt to new shapes. The shape formed will also be very dependent on the properties and cohesion of the different types of rock within each layer.

During the formation of flexural-slip folds, the different rock layers form parallel-slip folds to accommodate for buckling. A good way to visualize how the multiple layers are manipulated, is to bend a deck of cards and to imagine each card as a layer of rock stratum. The amount of slip on each side of the anticline increases from the hinge to the inflection point.

Passive-flow folds form when the rock is so soft that it behaves like weak plastic and slowly flows. In this process different parts of the rock body move at different rates causing shear stress to gradually shift from layer to layer. There is no mechanical contrast between layers in this type of fold. Passive-flow folds are extremely dependent on the rock composition of the stratum and can typically occur in areas with high temperatures.

== Economic significance ==
Anticlines, structural domes, fault zones and stratigraphic traps are very favorable locations for oil and natural gas drilling. About 80 percent of the world&#x27;s petroleum has been found in anticlinal traps. The low density of petroleum causes oil to buoyantly migrate out of its source rock and upward toward the surface until it is trapped and stored in reservoir rock such as sandstone or porous limestone. The oil becomes trapped along with water and natural gas by a caprock that is made up of impermeable barrier such as an impermeable stratum or fault zone. Examples of low-permeability seals that contain the hydrocarbons, oil and gas, in the ground include shale, limestone, sandstone, and rock salt. The actual type of stratum does not matter as long as it has low permeability.

Water, minerals and specific rock strata such as limestone found inside anticlines are also extracted and commercialized. Lastly, ancient fossils are often found in anticlines and are used for paleontological research or harvested into products to be sold.

==Notable examples==
===Asia===
Ghawar Anticline, Saudi Arabia, the structural trap for the largest conventional oil field in the world.

===Australia===
* Hill End Anticline, New South Wales, which is associated with deposits of gold.
* Castlemaine Anticlinal Fold, Victoria, which is celebrated with a plaque that says, &quot;This fine exhibit was disclosed when Lyttleton Street East was constructed in 1874. Saddle reefs occur in similar folds of the sandstones and slates on lower geological horizons.&quot;

===Europe===

The Weald–Artois Anticline is a major anticline which outcrops in southeast England and northern France. It was formed from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene, during the Alpine orogeny.

===North America===
Anticlines can have a major effect on the local geomorphology and economy of the regions in which they occur. One example of this is the El Dorado anticline in Kansas. The anticline was first tapped into for its petroleum in 1918. Soon after the site became a very prosperous area for entrepreneurs following World War I and the rapid popularization of motor vehicles. By 1995 the El Dorado oil fields had produced 300 million barrels of oil. The central Kansas uplift is an antiform composed of several small anticlines that have collectively produced more than 2.5 million barrels of oil.

Another notable anticline is the Tierra Amarilla anticline in San Ysidro, New Mexico. This is a popular hiking and biking site because of the great biodiversity, geologic beauty and paleontological resources. This plunging anticline is made up of Petrified Forest mudstones and sandstone and its caprock is made of Pleistocene and Holocene travertine. The anticline contains springs that deposit carbon dioxide travertine that help to contribute to the rich diversity of microorganisms. This area also contains remains of fossils and ancient plants from the Jurassic period that are sometimes exposed through geological erosion.

The Ventura Anticline is a geologic structure that is part of the Ventura oil fields, the seventh largest oil field in California that was discovered in the 1860s. The anticline runs east to west for 16 miles, dipping steeply 30–60 degrees at both ends. Ventura County has a high rate of compression and seismic activity due to the converging San Andreas Fault. As a result, the Ventura anticline rises at a rate of 5 mm/year with the adjacent Ventura Basin converging at a rate of about 7–10 mm/year. The anticline is composed of a series of sandstone rock beds and an impermeable rock cap under which vast reserves of oil and gas are trapped. Eight different oil bearing zones along the anticline vary greatly from 3,500 to 12,000 feet. The oil and gas formed these pools as they migrated upward during the Pliocene Era and became contained beneath the caprock. This oil field is still active and has a cumulative production of one billion barrels of oil making it one of the most vital historical and economic features of Ventura County.

<text>The Herbaliser is an English jazz hip hop group formed by Jake Wherry and Ollie Teeba in London, England during the early 1990s. Although currently releasing on their own label and having previously been signed to !K7 Records, they were one of the best-known acts from the Ninja Tune independent record label. They have released 12 albums, including two DJ mixes: one for Ninja Tune&#x27;s Solid Steel series and the other for Fabric&#x27;s Live Mix series. The Herbaliser&#x27;s album &quot;Same As It Never Was&quot; was their first release on !K7 Records. Their latest album &quot;Bring Out The Sound&quot; was released in 2018, on the BBE label.

Jake Wherry has also recorded solo tracks as The Meateaters, released on the Parisian Big Cheese label, and has worked with The Propheteers.

Ollie Teeba is also part of Soundsci with Jonny Cuba of Dynamic Syncopation, Audessey ex-Mass Influence, U-George The Hemisphere and Oxygen Sputnick Brown

==History==
Jake Wherry grew up in South West London and played guitar and bass in a number of jazz, funk and rock bands in his teenage years. During this time, he met Patrick Carpenter aka PC, later one of the DJs behind DJ Food, and through him became aware of the Ninja Tune label. Ollie Teeba, (real name Oliver Lawrence Trattles) began DJing at 15 and played his first live sets to London audiences a year later.

Wherry and Teeba met years later at Wherry&#x27;s Traintrax studio, and began recording together, collaborating with DJ Malachi, Kaidi Tatham of Bugz in the Attic and Ralph Lamb of Easy Access Orchestra. They developed a jazzy instrumental style of hip hop, due to an absence of available rappers. They passed their recordings on to Ninja Tune bosses Matt Black and Jonathan More of Coldcut and were signed shortly thereafter.

Inspired by the funk bands of previous decades, rather than performing simply with turntables, Jake Wherry decided to take a seven piece band on tour, which included Tatham, Lamb, Andrew Ross, Micah Moody Jnr and percussionist Patrick Dawes. The band performed in Toronto, Ontario on 1999.

As they progressed, they gained access to guest vocalists for appearances on their records, including What? What? (aka Jean Grae), Roots Manuva, MF Doom, Seaming To, Rakaa Iriscience of Dilated Peoples, Blade, Phi Life Cypher, Bahamadia, Dream Warriors and Insight .

The pair were subsequently employed to produce music for the likes of Motorola, the soundtracks to Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Snatch&quot; and the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;. They were also commissioned to write the theme for ESPN&#x27;s primetime NFL show &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;.

The group have also provided production for artists including T Love, Princess Superstar and remixes for artists including DJ Food, Raw Stylus, Push Button Objects, Jaffa and label-mates Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;Atomic Moog&quot;, which reached number one on the UK singles chart.

In 2009, the band released its second live band album, &quot;Session Two&quot;. This was recorded at The Easy Access Orchestra&#x27;s studio and mixed at Jake&#x27;s Train Trax Studio.

Jake Wherry was featured in the Gimlet Media podcast Heavyweight featuring the collaborative production of a track with a fan. Since 2021, Wherry has been working on tracks with Portuguese-British singer Maya Blandy, with &quot;Stardust&quot;, her debut track released in 2023, featuring house vocalist Kathy Brown.

<text>Jason &quot;Cone&quot; McCaslin (born 3 September 1980) is a Canadian musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer, serving as the bassist and backing vocalist of the band Sum 41. He and frontman Deryck Whibley are the only two members of the band to appear on every studio album.

==Early life==
McCaslin began playing bass at the age of 14, as a member of a grunge garage band called Second Opinion.
He is of Irish/Swedish descent.

McCaslin attended Exeter High School in Ajax, Ontario along with fellow Sum 41 band members Deryck Whibley, Dave Baksh, and their former drummer Steve Jocz.

He acquired the nickname &quot;Cone&quot; from fellow band member Deryck Whibley in high school, because he frequently ate ice cream cones at lunch.

==Career==
===Sum 41===
In 1999, the band signed an international record deal with Island Records. The band released their debut EP, &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot;, in 2000. Their first album, &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;, was released in 2001. The band achieved mainstream success with their first single from the album, &quot;Fat Lip&quot;, which reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard Modern Rock Tracks&quot; chart and remains the band&#x27;s most successful single to date. &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; was certified platinum in the United States, Canada and in the UK. The band has since released seven more studio albums: &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; (2002), &quot;Chuck&quot; (2004) &quot;Underclass Hero&quot; (2007), &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot; (2011), &quot;13 Voices&quot; (2016), &quot;Order in Decline&quot; (2019), and &quot;Heaven :x: Hell&quot; (2024). Sum 41&#x27;s first four studio albums are certified Platinum in Canada. McCaslin went by the name Sniper in Sum 41&#x27;s alter-ego heavy metal band Pain For Pleasure, where the members of Sum 41 would parody a 1980s metal band.

The band often performed more than 300 times each year and held long global tours, most of which lasted more than a year. They have been nominated for seven Juno Awards and have won twice (Group of the Year in 2002 and Rock Album of the Year for &quot;Chuck&quot; in 2005). Their fifth studio album, &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot;, was released on March 29, 2011 and was nominated for a Grammy at the 2012 Grammys for the song &quot;Blood in My Eyes&quot; in the Hard Rock/Metal category.

=== Other appearances ===
He co-created the garage punk/garage rock side project The Operation M.D., with Todd Morse (of H2O), in which he goes by the name Dr. Dynamite. He plays bass guitar and other instruments on the songs including lead vocals on a few tracks on both albums. The first album, &quot;We Have an Emergency&quot; was released in Canada and Japan exclusively in 2007. Operation M.D. then released their second album &quot;Birds + Bee Stings&quot; worldwide in late 2010 on their own label Mouth To Mouth Music.

He has also acted in many Sum 41 short films. For example, in &quot;Basketball Butcher&quot;, he gets beaten up, killed and eaten by Steve Jocz due to beating him at basketball. He also played Dante the drug dealer in &quot;1-800-Justice.&quot;
He helped produce an album with Shelter With Thieves, a Canadian band from Halifax, Nova Scotia. The EP, entitled &quot;Confessions of a Toxic Generation&quot;, was nominated for two Nova Scotia Music Awards, for Group Recording and Loud Recording. The band won the Loud Recording award for the EP.

In December 2009, McCaslin was also producing five songs for a new album by Canadian piano rock band The Greatest Invention (Formally – Credible Witness), which eventually got released under Walter Senko.

Then, in 2010, he began producing three songs for the seven-piece bluegrass/folk/indie band The Strumbellas. In September 2011, he was asked to produce the rest of the album &quot;My Father and the Hunter.&quot; It was released on February 21, 2012 and received a Juno Award nomination for Best Root/Traditional Album.
In October 2013, McCaslin made a cameo playing bass in The Strumbellas music video for &quot;End of an Era&quot;. In 2013 McCaslin began working with Toronto band Sun K. and produced their 7&quot; (two songs) which was released and also produced their EP and LP over the following year. In 2014, McCaslin began producing two songs for the band LeBarons which were released in 2015. He started hosting his own radio show titled &quot;Cone&#x27;s Cave&quot; on CKGE-FM. The first episode aired on February 12, 2022.

==Instruments==
McCaslin uses Fender &#x27;59 Re-Issue Precision Basses live and a Fender American Vintage &#x27;62 Re-Issue Precision Bass to record with. His personal favorite is an Olympic white Fender Precision Bass, since he was a fan of Dee Dee Ramone.

==Personal life==
He got married on September 5, 2008. During the wedding, McCaslin&#x27;s fellow band members Deryck Whibley of Sum 41 and Todd Morse of H2O and The Operation M.D. performed &quot;One&quot; by U2 and &quot;Pieces&quot; by Sum 41.

McCaslin has two sisters. On December 22, 2014, his first son Max Grey McCaslin was born.

On October 9, 2018, he and his wife Shannon had a daughter, Ayla Rose McCaslin.

<doc id="1345560" wikidata="Q1126340" url="?curid=1345560" title="Pyrrhonism">
<text>Pyrrhonism is an Ancient Greek school of philosophical skepticism which rejects dogma and advocates the suspension of judgement over the truth of all beliefs. It was founded by Aenesidemus in the first century BCE, and said to have been inspired by the teachings of Pyrrho and Timon of Phlius in the fourth century BCE. 

Pyrrhonism is best known today through the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, writing in the late second century or early third century CE. The publication of Sextus&#x27; works in the Renaissance ignited a revival of interest in Skepticism and played a major role in Reformation thought and the development of early modern philosophy.

==History==
Pyrrhonism is named after Pyrrho of Elis, a Greek philosopher in the 4th century BCE who was credited by the later Pyrrhonists with forming the first comprehensive school of skeptical thought. However, ancient testimony about the philosophical beliefs of the historical Pyrrho is minimal, and often contradictory: his teachings were recorded by his student Timon of Phlius, but those works have been lost, and only survive in fragments quoted by later authors, and based on testimonies of later authors such as Cicero. Pyrrho&#x27;s own philosophy as recorded by Timon may have been much more dogmatic than that of the later school who bore his name. While Pyrrhonism would become the dominant form of skepticism in the early Roman period, in the Hellenistic period, the Platonic Academy was the primary advocate of skepticism until the mid-first century BCE, when Pyrrhonism as a philosophical school was founded by Aenesidemus.

==Philosophy==
The goal of Pyrrhonism is ataraxia, an untroubled and tranquil condition of soul that results from a suspension of judgement, a mental rest owing to which we neither deny nor affirm anything. 

Pyrrhonists dispute that the dogmatists – which includes all of Pyrrhonism&#x27;s rival philosophies – claim to have found truth regarding non-evident matters, and that these opinions about non-evident matters (i.e., dogma) are what prevent one from attaining eudaimonia. For any of these dogmas, a Pyrrhonist makes arguments for and against such that the matter cannot be concluded, thus suspending judgement, and thereby inducing ataraxia.

Pyrrhonists can be subdivided into those who are ephectic (engaged in suspension of judgment), aporetic (engaged in refutation) or zetetic (engaged in seeking). An ephectic merely suspends judgment on a matter, &quot;balancing perceptions and thoughts against one another.&quot; It is a less aggressive form of skepticism, in that sometimes &quot;suspension of judgment evidently just happens to the sceptic&quot;. An aporetic skeptic, in contrast, works more actively towards their goal, engaging in the refutation of arguments in favor of various possible beliefs in order to reach aporia, an impasse, or state of perplexity, which leads to suspension of judgement. Finally, the zetetic claims to be continually searching for the truth but to have thus far been unable to find it, and thus continues to suspend belief while also searching for reason to cease the suspension of belief.

=== Modes ===
Although Pyrrhonism&#x27;s objective is ataraxia, it is best known for its epistemological arguments. The core practice is through setting argument against argument. To aid in this, the Pyrrhonist philosophers Aenesidemus and Agrippa developed sets of stock arguments known as &quot;modes&quot; or &quot;tropes.&quot;

====The ten modes of Aenesidemus====
Aenesidemus is considered the creator of &quot;the ten tropes of Aenesidemus&quot; (also known as &quot;the ten modes of Aenesidemus&quot;)—although whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior Pyrrhonist works is unknown. The tropes represent reasons for suspension of judgment. These are as follows:
# Different animals manifest different modes of perception;
# Similar differences are seen among individual men;
# For the same man, information perceived with the senses is self-contradictory
# Furthermore, it varies from time to time with physical changes
# In addition, this data differs according to local relations
# Objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air, moisture, etc.
# These objects are in a condition of perpetual change in colour, temperature, size and motion
# All perceptions are relative and interact one upon another
# Our impressions become less critical through repetition and custom
# All men are brought up with different beliefs, under different laws and social conditions
According to Sextus, superordinate to these ten modes stand three other modes: that based on the subject who judges (modes 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4), that based on the object judged (modes 7 &amp; 10), that based on both subject who judges and object judged (modes 5, 6, 8 &amp; 9), and superordinate to these three modes is the mode of relation.

===The five modes of Agrippa===
These &quot;tropes&quot; or &quot;modes&quot; are given by Sextus Empiricus in his &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot;. According to Sextus, they are attributed only &quot;to the more recent skeptics&quot; and it is by Diogenes Laërtius that we attribute them to Agrippa. The &quot;five tropes of Agrippa&quot; are: 
# &quot;Dissent&quot; – The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general.
# &quot;Infinite regress&quot; – All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity.
# &quot;Relation&quot; – All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as we look upon them from different points of view.
# &quot;Assumption&quot; – The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption.
# &quot;Circularity&quot; – The truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs.

 According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life and among philosophers. Because of this we are not able to choose or to rule out anything, and we end up with suspension of judgement. In the mode deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such source, which itself needs another, and so &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, so that we have no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement follows. In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgement on what it is like in its nature. We have the mode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, begin from something which they do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish the other, we suspend judgement about both.

With reference to these five tropes, that the first and third are a short summary of the earlier Ten Modes of Aenesidemus. The three additional ones show a progress in the Pyrrhonist system, building upon the objections derived from the fallibility of sense and opinion to more abstract and metaphysical grounds. According to Victor Brochard &quot;the five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of skepticism that has ever been given. In a sense, they are still irresistible today.&quot;

===Criteria of action===
Pyrrhonist decision making is made according to what the Pyrrhonists describe as the &quot;criteria of action&quot; holding to the appearances, without beliefs in accord with the ordinary regimen of life based on: 
# the guidance of nature, by which we are naturally capable of sensation and thought
# the compulsion of the passions by which hunger drives us to food and thirst makes us drink
# the handing down of customs and laws by which we accept that piety in the conduct of life is good and impiety bad
# instruction in &quot;techne&quot;

===Skeptic sayings===
The Pyrrhonists devised several sayings (Greek ΦΩΝΩΝ) to help practitioners bring their minds to suspend judgment. Among these are:

* Not more, nothing more (a saying attributed to Democritus)
* Non-assertion (&quot;aphasia&quot;)
* Perhaps, it is possible, maybe
* I withhold assent
* I determine nothing (Montaigne created a variant of this as his own personal motto, &quot;Que sais-je?&quot; – &quot;what do I know?&quot;)
* Everything is indeterminate
* Everything is non-apprehensible
* I do not apprehend
* To every argument an equal argument is opposed

==Texts==
Except for the works of Sextus Empiricus, the texts of ancient Pyrrhonism have been lost. There is a summary of the &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot; by Aenesidemus, preserved by Photius, and a brief summary of Pyrrho&#x27;s teaching by Aristocles, quoting Pyrrho&#x27;s student Timon preserved by Eusebius:
&#x27;The things themselves are equally indifferent, and unstable, and indeterminate, and therefore neither our senses nor our opinions are either true or false. For this reason then we must not trust them, but be without opinions, and without bias, and without wavering, saying of every single thing that it no more is than is not, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not.

==Influence==
===In Ancient Greek philosophy===

Pyrrhonism is often contrasted with Academic skepticism, a similar but distinct form of Hellenistic philosophical skepticism. While early Academic skepticism was influenced in part by Pyrrho, it grew more and more dogmatic until Aenesidemus broke with the Academics to revive Pyrrhonism in the first century BCE, denouncing the Academy as &quot;Stoics fighting against Stoics.&quot; Some later Pyrrhonists, such as Sextus Empiricus, go so far as to claim that Pyrrhonists are the only real skeptics, dividing all philosophy into the dogmatists, the Academics, and the skeptics. Dogmatists claim to have knowledge, Academic skeptics claim that knowledge is impossible, while Pyrrhonists assent to neither proposition, suspending judgment on both. The second century Roman historian Aulus Gellius describes the distinction as &quot;...the Academics apprehend (in some sense) the very fact that nothing can be apprehended, and they determine (in some sense) that nothing can be determined, whereas the Pyrrhonists assert that not even that seems to be true, since nothing seems to be true.&quot;

Sextus Empiricus also said that the Pyrrhonist school influenced and had substantial overlap with the Empiric school of medicine, but that Pyrrhonism had more in common with the Methodic school in that it &quot;follow[s] the appearances and take[s] from these whatever seems expedient.&quot; 

Although Julian the Philosopher mentions that Pyrrhonism had died out at the time of his writings, other writers mention the existence of later Pyrrhonists. Pseudo-Clement, writing around the same time (-320 CE) mentions Pyrrhonists in his &quot;Homilies&quot; and Agathias even reports a Pyrrhonist named Uranius as late as the middle of the 6th century CE.

===Similarities between Pyrrhonism and Indian philosophy===
According to Diogenes Laërtius, Pyrrho was said to have traveled to India with Alexander the Great&#x27;s army, where Pyrrho was said to have studied with the so-called magi and the gymnosophists. This has led some to wonder whether he may have been influenced by Buddhist teachings while in India, most particularly the three marks of existence. Scholars who argue for such influence mention the fact that even the ancient author Diogenesis Laërtius states as much, when he wrote that Pyrrho “foregathered with the Indian Gymnosophists and with the Magi. This led him to adopt a most noble philosophy.&quot;

According to Christopher I. Beckwith&#x27;s analysis of the &#x27;Aristocles Passage&#x27;, &quot;adiaphora&quot; (anatta), &quot;astathmēta&quot; (dukkha), and &quot;anepikrita&quot; (anicca) are strikingly similar to the Buddhist three marks of existence, indicating that Pyrrho&#x27;s teaching is based on Buddhism. Beckwith contends that the 18 months Pyrrho spent in India were long enough to learn a foreign language, and that the key innovative tenets of Pyrrho&#x27;s skepticism were only found in Indian philosophy at the time and not in Greece. Other similarities between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism include a version of the tetralemma among the Pyrrhonist maxims, and more significantly, the idea of suspension of judgement and how that can lead to peace and liberation; &quot;ataraxia&quot; in Pyrrhonism and &quot;nirvāṇa&quot; in Buddhism.

Furthermore, Buddhist philosopher Jan Westerhoff says that &quot;many of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s arguments concerning causation bear strong similarities to classical skeptical arguments as presented in the third book of Sextus Empiricus&#x27;s &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot;,&quot; and Thomas McEvilley suspects that Nagarjuna may have been influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. McEvilley argues for mutual iteration in the Buddhist logico-epistemological traditions between Pyrrhonism and Madhyamika:

An extraordinary similarity, that has long been noticed, between Pyrrhonism and Mādhyamaka is the formula known in connection with Buddhism as the fourfold negation (&quot;Catuṣkoṭi&quot;) and which in Pyrrhonic form might be called the fourfold indeterminacy.

McEvilley also notes a correspondence between the Pyrrhonist and Madhyamaka views about truth, comparing Sextus&#x27; account of two criteria regarding truth, one which judges between reality and unreality, and another which we use as a guide in everyday life. By the first criteria, nothing is either true or false, but by the second, information from the senses may be considered either true or false for practical purposes. As Edward Conze has noted, this is similar to the Madhyamika Two Truths doctrine, a distinction between &quot;Absolute truth&quot; (&quot;paramārthasatya&quot;), &quot;the knowledge of the real as it is without any distortion,&quot; and &quot;Truth so-called&quot; (&quot;saṃvṛti satya&quot;), &quot;truth as conventionally believed in common parlance.

However, other scholars, such as Stephen Batchelor and Charles Goodman question Beckwith&#x27;s conclusions about the degree of Buddhist influence on Pyrrho. Conversely, while critical of Beckwith&#x27;s ideas, Kuzminsky sees credibility in the hypothesis that Pyrrho was influenced by Buddhism, even if it cannot be safely ascertained with our current information. 

While discussing Christopher Beckwith&#x27;s claims in &quot;Greek Buddha: Pyrrho&#x27;s Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia&quot;, Jerker Blomqvist states that: 

On the other hand, certain elements that are generally regarded as essential features of Buddhism are entirely absent from ancient Pyrrhonism/scepticism. The concepts of good and bad karma must have been an impossibility in the Pyrrhonist universe, if &quot;things&quot; were ἀδιάφορα, &#x27;without a logical self-identity&#x27;, and, consequently, could not be differentiated from each other by labels such as &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; or &#x27;just&#x27; and &#x27;unjust&#x27;. A doctrine of rebirth, reminiscent of the Buddhist one though favored by Plato and Pythagoras, was totally alien to the Pyrrhonists. The ἀταραξία, &#x27;undisturbedness&#x27;, that the Pyrrhonists promised their followers, may have a superficial resemblance to the Buddhist nirvana, but ἀταραξία, unlike nirvana, did not involve a liberation from a cycle of reincarnation; rather, it was a mode of life in this world, blessed with μετριοπάθεια, &#x27;moderation of feeling&#x27; or &#x27;moderate suffering&#x27;, not with the absence of any variety of pain. Kuzminski, whom Beckwith hails as a precursor of his, had largely ignored the problem with this disparity between Buddhism and Pyrrhonism. 

Ajñana, which upheld radical skepticism, may have been a more powerful influence on Pyrrho than Buddhism. The Buddhists referred to Ajñana&#x27;s adherents as &quot;Amarāvikkhepikas&quot; or &quot;eel-wrigglers&quot;, due to their refusal to commit to a single doctrine. Scholars including Barua, Jayatilleke, and Flintoff, contend that Pyrrho was influenced by, or at the very least agreed with, Indian skepticism rather than Buddhism or Jainism, based on the fact that he valued ataraxia, which can be translated as &quot;freedom from worry&quot;. Jayatilleke, in particular, contends that Pyrrho may have been influenced by the first three schools of Ajñana, since they too valued freedom from worry.

===Modern===

The recovery and publication of the works of Sextus Empiricus, particularly a widely influential translation by Henri Estienne published in 1562, ignited a revival of interest in Pyrrhonism. Philosophers of the time used his works to source their arguments on how to deal with the religious issues of their day. Major philosophers such as Michel de Montaigne, Marin Mersenne, and Pierre Gassendi later drew on the model of Pyrrhonism outlined in Sextus Empiricus&#x27; works for their own arguments. This resurgence of Pyrrhonism has sometimes been called the beginning of modern philosophy. Montaigne adopted the image of a balance scale for his motto, which became a modern symbol of Pyrrhonism. It has also been suggested that Pyrrhonism provided the skeptical underpinnings that René Descartes drew from in developing his influential method of Cartesian doubt and the associated turn of early modern philosophy towards epistemology. In the 18th century, David Hume was also considerably influenced by Pyrrhonism, using &quot;Pyrrhonism&quot; as a synonym for &quot;skepticism.&quot;. 

Friedrich Nietzsche, however, criticized the &quot;ephectics&quot; of the Pyrrhonists as a flaw of early philosophers, whom he characterized as &quot;shy little blunderer[s] and milquetoast[s] with crooked legs&quot; prone to overindulging &quot;his doubting drive, his negating drive, his wait-and-see (&#x27;ephectic&#x27;) drive, his analytical drive, his exploring, searching, venturing drive, his comparing, balancing drive, his will to neutrality and objectivity, his will to every &quot;sine ira et studio&quot;: have we already grasped that for the longest time they all went against the first demands of morality and conscience?&quot;

===Contemporary===
The term &quot;neo-Pyrrhonism&quot; is used to refer to modern Pyrrhonists such as Benson Mates and Robert Fogelin.

<doc id="1345561" wikidata="Q1414527" url="?curid=1345561" title="Algiers (1938 film)">
<text>Algiers is a 1938 American drama film directed by John Cromwell and starring Charles Boyer, Sigrid Gurie, and Hedy Lamarr. Written by John Howard Lawson, the film is about a notorious French jewel thief hiding in the labyrinthine native quarter of Algiers known as the Casbah. Feeling imprisoned by his self-imposed exile, he is drawn out of hiding by a beautiful French tourist who reminds him of happier times in Paris. The Walter Wanger production was a remake of the successful 1937 French film &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot;, which derived its plot from the Henri La Barthe novel of the same name.

&quot;Algiers&quot; was a sensation because it was the first Hollywood film starring Hedy Lamarr, whose beauty became the main attraction for film audiences. The film is notable as one of the sources of inspiration to the screenwriters of the 1942 Warner Bros. film &quot;Casablanca&quot;, who wrote it with Hedy Lamarr in mind as the original female lead. Charles Boyer&#x27;s depiction of Pepe le Moko inspired the Warner Bros. animated character Pepé Le Pew. In 1966, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

==Plot==
Pepe le Moko is a notorious thief, who, after his last great heist, escaped from France to Algeria. Since his escape, le Moko became a resident and leader of the immense Casbah, or &quot;native quarter&quot;, of Algiers. French officials who arrive insisting on Pepe&#x27;s capture are met with unfazed local detectives, led by Inspector Slimane, who are biding their time. Meanwhile, Pepe begins to feel increasingly trapped in his prison-like stronghold, a feeling which intensifies after meeting the beautiful Gaby, who is visiting from France. His love for Gaby soon arouses the jealousy of Ines, Pepe&#x27;s Algerian mistress.

The song in this film is called &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot; which means &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; in French.

Cast notes
* Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr made her American film debut in &quot;Algiers&quot;, although she was already known for her appearance in the 1933 Czech film &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, in which she appeared totally nude. Howard Dietz, the head of MGM&#x27;s publicity department, quizzed her about this, and she admitted to having appeared nude. &quot;Did you look good?&quot;, he asked. &quot;Of course!&quot; &quot;Then it&#x27;s all right&quot;, he said, &quot;no damage has been done.&quot;

==Production==
Walter Wanger, the producer of &quot;Algiers&quot;, purchased the rights to the French film &quot;Pepe le Moko&quot;, starring Jean Gabin, in order to remake it, and bought all prints of the film to prevent it from competing with his film in the U.S. Wanger used most of the music from the French film in this remake as well as background sequences.

The first version of the script for &quot;Algiers&quot; was rejected by the Breen Office because the leading ladies were both portrayed as &quot;kept women,&quot; and because of references to prostitution, the promiscuity of the lead character, and his suicide at the end of the film, which was directed to be changed to his being shot instead of killing himself.

Backgrounds and exteriors for the film were shot in Algiers by a photographer named Knechtel, who was based in London. These photographs were integrated into the film by cinematographer James Wong Howe.

United Artists had considered Ingrid Bergman, Dolores del Río, and Sylvia Sidney for the female lead, but, as Boyer tells it, he met Hedy Lamarr at a party and introduced her to Wanger as a possibility for his co-lead. Cromwell says about Lamarr that she could not act. &quot;After you&#x27;ve been in the business for a time, you can tell easily enough right when you meet them. I could sense her inadequacy, Wanger could sense it, and I could see Boyer getting worried even before we started talking behind Hedy&#x27;s back...Sometimes the word personality is interchangeable with presence although they aren&#x27;t the same thing. But the principle applies, and Hedy also had no personality. How could they think she could become a second Garbo?...I&#x27;ll take some credit for making her acting passable but can only share credit with Boyer fifty-fifty.&quot;

Boyer did not enjoy his work on &quot;Algiers&quot;. &quot;An actor never likes to copy another&#x27;s style,&quot; he said, &quot;and here I was copying Jean Gabin, one of the best.&quot; Director Cromwell &quot;would run a scene from the original and insist we do it exactly that way — terrible, a perfectly terrible way to work.&quot; Cromwell, however, said that Boyer &quot;never appreciated how different his own Pepe was from Gabin&#x27;s. Boyer showed something like genius to make it different. It was a triumph of nuance. The shots are the same, the dialogue has the same meaning, but Boyer&#x27;s Pepe and Gabin&#x27;s Pepe are two different fellows but in the same predicament.&quot;

==Box office==
The film earned a profit of $150,466.

==Adaptations and remakes==
===Radio===
In the autumn of 1938, &quot;Hollywood Playhouse&quot; presented a radio adaptation of &quot;Algiers&quot; starring Charles Boyer.

&quot;Algiers&quot; was adapted for the October 8, 1939, presentation of the CBS Radio series &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. The hour-long adaptation starred Orson Welles and Paulette Goddard, with Ray Collins taking the role of Inspector Slimane.

The film was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on two broadcasts of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr reprised their roles in the broadcast July 7, 1941. Boyer starred with Loretta Young in the broadcast December 14, 1942.

===Film===
A musical remake of &quot;Algiers&quot; titled &quot;Casbah&quot; was released in 1948 by Universal Pictures and starred Tony Martin and Yvonne De Carlo. A 1949 Italian parody titled &quot;Totò Le Moko&quot; featured the comedian Totò.

==In popular culture==
The 1938 film &quot;Algiers&quot; was most Americans&#x27; introduction to the picturesque alleys and souks of the Casbah. It was also the inspiration for the 1942 film &quot;Casablanca&quot;, written specifically for Hedy Lamarr in the female lead role. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, however, refused to release Lamarr, so the role went to Ingrid Bergman.

The oft-quoted invitation extended by Charles Boyer to &quot;come with me to the Casbah&quot; does not appear in the film, but still became comedians&#x27; standard imitation of Boyer, much like &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot; for Humphrey Bogart, &quot;Judy, Judy, Judy&quot; for Cary Grant and &quot;You dirty rat&quot; for James Cagney– all apocryphal lines. Boyer hated being reduced in that way, believing that it demeaned him as an actor. In some part, the lampoon of Boyer spread, owing to its use by &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon character Pepé Le Pew, a spoof of Boyer as Pépé le Moko. The amorous skunk used &quot;Come with me to the Casbah&quot; as a pickup line. In 1954, the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Bah&quot;, which specifically spoofed &quot;Algiers&quot;, the skunk enthusiastically declared to Penelope Pussycat &quot;You do not have to come with me to ze Casbah. We are already here!&quot;

Parts of the dialog between Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr have been sampled by new wave band The New Occupants for their song &quot;Electric Angel&quot;.

<text>Sea Venture was a seventeenth-century English sailing ship, part of the Third Supply mission flotilla to the Jamestown Colony in 1609. She was the 300 ton flagship of the London Company. During the voyage to Virginia, &quot;Sea Venture&quot; encountered a tropical storm and was wrecked, with her crew and passengers landing on the uninhabited Bermuda. &quot;Sea Venture&quot;″s wreck is widely thought to have been the inspiration for William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1611 play &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

==The Virginia Company ==
The proprietors of the London Company had established the settlement of Jamestown in Virginia in 1607, and delivered supplies and additional settlers in 1608, raising the English colony&#x27;s population to 200, despite many deaths. The entire operation was characterized by a lack of resources and experience. The company&#x27;s fleet was composed of vessels that were less than optimal for delivering large numbers of passengers across the Atlantic Ocean, and the colony itself was threatened by starvation, diseases, and warfare with native peoples.

The colony at Jamestown seemed doomed to meet the same fate as the Roanoke Colony and the Popham Colony, two earlier failed English attempts to settle in North America, unless there was a major relief effort, despite the delivery of supplies in 1608 on the First and Second Supply missions of Captain Christopher Newport. Yet the investors of the London Company expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay the cost of the voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony.

It fell to the third president of the council to deliver a reply. Ever bold, Captain John Smith delivered what must have been a wake-up call to the investors in London. In what has been termed &quot;Smith&#x27;s Rude Answer&quot;, he composed a letter, writing (in part):

Smith did begin his letter with something of an apology, saying &quot;I humbly intreat your Pardons if I offend you with my rude Answer&quot;.

There are strong indications that those in London comprehended and embraced Smith&#x27;s message. Their Third Supply mission was by far the largest and best equipped. They even had the newly constructed purpose-built flagship &quot;Sea Venture&quot; placed in the most experienced hands of Christopher Newport.

==Construction==
&quot;Sea Venture&quot; was most likely built in 1603 and used in trade with the Low Countriesthough there are competing theories which do not stand scrutiny. The archaeological evidence suggests that she was not a newly-built vessel at the time of her loss. She was, however, built according to the latest methods for the early 17th century. As such her shape is a development from vessels such as &quot;Mary Rose&quot;. Her hull shape can be extrapolated from the limited archaeological remains to show a stable hull (even allowing for some inaccuracies in that process)a finding that is confirmed by her surviving a hurricane (it was a leak that was the problem that arose during the storm).

==Voyage, the storm, and loss in Bermuda==
On , &quot;Sea Venture&quot; set sail from Plymouth, England as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia as part of the Third Supply, carrying 500 to 600 people (it is unclear whether that number includes crew, or only settlers). Normally, ships destined for North America from Europe sailed south as far as the Canary Islands as at that latitude the mean direction of the wind is to the West, pushing them across the Atlantic (ships returning to Europe turned eastward at the Carolinas, as at that latitude the mean wind direction is to the East), then followed the chain of west Indian islands to Florida and from there followed the Atlantic coast of the continent. However, with the West Indies firmly in the grip of the Spanish Empire, the English fleet turned Northwards in the open Atlantic, intending to bypass the Spanish threat and head directly for Virginia. Days away from Jamestown, on 24 July, the fleet ran into a strong tropical storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. A pinnace, &quot;Catch&quot;, went down with all aboard lost. &quot;Sea Venture&quot; however, fought the storm for three days. Among sheets of rain and tearing wind, passengers witnessed St. Elmo&#x27;s fire atop the masts.
Comparably sized ships had survived such weather, but &quot;Sea Venture&quot; had a critical flaw in her newness: her timbers had not set. The oakum (a caulking) was forced from between the boards, and the ship began to leak rapidly. All hands were applied to bailing, but water continued to rise in the hold. The ship&#x27;s starboard-side guns were reportedly jettisoned to raise her buoyancy, but this only delayed the inevitable. The Admiral of the Company himself, Sir George Somers, was at the helm through the storm. When he spied land on the morning of , the water in the hold had risen to , and crew and passengers had been driven past the point of exhaustion.

Whilst still being driven before the storm, the only choice was to try and pick a route through the offshore reefs. About from shore, the ship became wedged in a V-shaped gap in the reefs (in what later was named Sea Venture Shoals). The worst of the weather now passed. This allowed 140 men and 10 women (who mostly could not swim), and one dog, to be taken ashore in boats. The passengers and crew ferried to the beach at Gates&#x27; Bay, St. George&#x27;s Island.

The survivors included several company officials: Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, the ship&#x27;s captain Christopher Newport, Samuel Jordan, Silvester Jourdain, Stephen Hopkins (later of &quot;Mayflower&quot;), along with secretary William Strachey. Along with future English notables George Yeardley and John Rolfe, the Powhatan emissary Namontack and his companion, Machumps, were all stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months.

==&quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;==
The settlers were unwilling to move on, having now heard about the true conditions in Jamestown from the sailors, and made multiple attempts to rebel and stay in Bermuda. They argued, as the &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers later argued, that they had been freed from their contract by the hurricane and shipwreck, and could now choose their own government. Governor Gates suppressed escape attempts, and the new settlement became a prison labour camp, with settlers forced to build ships to carry them away against their wills.

During the time on Bermuda, the survivors constructed two new ships, the pinnaces &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;, from local Bermuda cedar, which was a wood especially prized by regional ship builders because it was as strong as oak, yet lighter. This misnamed juniper species could be worked with immediately after felling, and it has high resistance to rot and wood worms. Materials salvaged from the beached wreck were also used, especially her rigging. They were constructed between late fall 1609 and early spring 1610 under the guidance of Admiral Somers and James Davis, Captain of the &quot;Gift of God&quot; who possessed considerable ship building knowledge. These ships represented the second and third pinnaces built in the English colonies in the Americas, the first being the 1607–08 construction of &quot;Virginia&quot; at the Popham Colony in New England.

The original plan was to build only one vessel, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, but it soon became evident that she would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the food that was being sourced on the islands. The &quot;Deliverance&quot; was constructed under the direction of ship carpenter Richard Frobisher not far from Gates&#x27; Bay, at a beach is still known as Buildings Bay (or Building Cove). The &quot;Patience&quot; is generally believed to have been built on the at Walsingham Bay (on the western shore of Castle Harbour) said to be named after the coxswain Robert Walsingham). Bermudian teacher and Lieutenant-Commander Royal Naval Reserve (Sea Cadet Corps) Dr. Derek Tully, however, has suggested St. David&#x27;s Island as the construction site. In Stratchey&#x27;s account:

While the new ships were being built, &quot;Sea Venture&quot;″s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent under the command of Henry Ravens to find Virginia, but the boat and her crew were never seen again. Finally, under the command of Newport, the two ships with 142 survivors (of the 150-153 mariners and passengers Strachey reported surviving the wreck – Gates, Somers, Newport, and 150 others – those who died in Bermuda were: Mrs. Rolfe, the wife of John Rolfe; Edward Samuell, the sailor killed by Waters; Richard Lewis; William Hitchman; Jeffery Briars; and Henry Paine, who had been executed by firing squad. The Powhattan emissary Namontack had vanished while on a hunting expedition with Machumps and his fate was never discovered. Henry Ravens had been sent to Jamestown in command of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;″s longboat, fitted out for the ocean voyage, along with cape merchant Thomas Whittingham and 6 unidentified sailors; they returned several days later, having been unable to find a passage through Bermuda&#x27;s reefline onto the open Atlantic, then set out for another attempt and were never heard of again. Two children were born in Bermuda: the daughter of the Rolfes, &quot;Bermuda Rolfe&quot;, who died and was buried in Bermuda; and &quot;Bermudas Eason&quot;, the son of Edward Eason and his wife. Minus Carter and Waters, this would give a figure of 137 passengers and crew that continued to Jamestown aboard the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;, including one child born in Bermuda after the wreck of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;) set sail for Virginia on 10 May 1610, and arrived at the Jamestown settlement on the 23rd, a journey of less than two weeks. Two sailors, Christopher Carter and Edward Waters (whom some records name Robert Waters), remained behind on Smith&#x27;s Island—Waters faced possible trial for the killing of another sailor and had fled into the forest. Carter, like many others of the settlers and crew, did not wish to leave Bermuda and had joined Waters in the forest to avoid being compelled to leave.
On reaching Jamestown, only 60 survivors were found of the 500 or so who had preceded them. Many of these were themselves dying, and Jamestown was quickly judged to be nonviable. Everyone then boarded &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Deliverance,&quot; and &quot;Patience,&quot; which set sail for England. The timely arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Baron De La Warre, granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were relanded at the colony, but there was still a critical shortage of food. In the fall of 1610, Admiral Somers returned to Bermuda in &quot;Patience&quot; to obtain wild pigs and food that had been stockpiled there. Unfortunately, Somers died in Bermuda from a &quot;surfeit of pork&quot; and the pinnace, captained by his nephew Mathew Somers, returned directly to Lyme Regis in Dorset, England with the body in order to claim his inheritance. Christopher Carter and Edward Waters, who evidently had been forgiven their earlier desertion, remained behind in Bermuda, again, joined by Edward Chard, the first permanent settlers of Bermuda (Christopher Carter and Edward Waters were to be among the &quot;Counsell of Six&quot; appointed to advise the first Lieutenant-Governor of Bermuda, Richard Moore, in 1612, and amongst whom the Lieutenant-Governorship was rotated during the period in 1616 between the departure of Moore and the arrival of his successor). Overall, the food and supplies brought by the Third Supply were not adequate. 80% of the colonists would die during the Starving Time of 1610. Afterwards, survivors at Jamestown had boarded &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot; and were sailing downstream to the ocean when they met yet another resupply fleet. Lord Delaware was this expedition&#x27;s leader and he turned the distraught settlers back. He had brought a doctor but food supplies remained inadequate.

==Later history==
&quot;Sea Venture&quot; sat atop the reefs off Gate&#x27;s Bay long enough to be stripped of all useful parts and materials, not only by her crew and passengers, but by subsequent settlers; what was left of her eventually disappeared beneath the waves. Two of her guns were salvaged in 1612 and used in the initial fortification of Bermuda (one was placed on Governor&#x27;s Island, opposite Paget&#x27;s Fort, the other on Castle Island).

After the wreck&#x27;s submergence, her precise location was unknown until rediscovered by sport divers Downing and Heird in October 1958, still wedged into a coral reef. There was little left of the ship or its cargo. Despite the lack of artifacts to be found, she was positively identified in 1959, in time for the 350th anniversary of the wrecking. Subsequent research uncovered one gun and cannonball, along with shot for small arms. There were also some Spanish jars, stoneware from Germany and ceramics and cooking pots much like what had been found excavating Jamestown.
In the 1960s, a replica of &quot;Deliverance&quot; was displayed (in drydock) on Ordnance Island. Deeming the replica beyond repair and unsafe after decades of storms, it was demolished in 2022 (fifty years later).

In 2015, the remains of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; hull was buried with sandbags, to protect the remnants from shipworms.

==In writing==

* The wrecking is believed to have inspired William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. This tradition has been confirmed by a detailed comparison to survivors&#x27; narratives such as Silvester Jourdain (&quot;A Discovery of the Barmudas&quot;), Robert Rich (&quot;Newes from Virginia: the lost flocke triumphant&quot;), and that of historian and author William Strachey, who wrote an account of the storm entitled &quot;True Reportory of the Wrack, and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates Knight&quot;, was the primary source Shakespeare drew upon.

* Bermuda resident and novelist, F. Van Wyck Mason, wrote a fictionalised account of the wrecking, &quot;The Sea &#x27;Venture&quot;, first published in 1961.
* 20th-century American author Scott O&#x27;Dell wrote and published a fictionalized account of &quot;Sea Venture&quot; shipwreck called &quot;The Serpent Never Sleeps&quot;.
* Children&#x27;s author Clyde Robert Bulla wrote a fictionalized account of &quot;Sea Venture&quot; voyage called &quot;A Lion to Guard Us&quot;. It focuses on three children sailing to Jamestown to find their father.
* &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was also the namesake of a cruise liner which operated between the US and Bermuda in the 1970s for Flagship Cruises, before being obtained by Princess Cruises, which renamed her &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;, which was subsequently used in the television show &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

<doc id="1345575" wikidata="Q10113811" url="?curid=1345575" title="Setos">
<text>Setos (, , , ) are an indigenous Finnic peoples and linguistic minority that have historically lived in the borderlands between modern day Estonia and Russia. Setos have historically spoken the Seto language and been Orthodox Christians. The Seto language (like Estonian and Finnish) belongs to the Finnic group of the Uralic language family. Since the early 2000s, the Setos have sought greater recognition, rather than having their language considered a dialect of Estonian. Eastern Orthodox Christianity, with influences from local folk religions is widely practiced by the Seto peoples.

The ancestral homes of many Setos can be found to the south of Lake Peipus, in the Setomaa region. After 1991 however, this territory was divided between the newly independent Estonia (Põlva and Võro counties) and the north-western sections of the Russian Federation (Pechorsky District of Pskov Oblast).
== Ethnic history ==

The definitive origin of the Seto people is unknown to researchers, only that they first emerged in Setomaa around the Piusa River. This was an area that was an intersection between the Finnic peoples and the Balts. 

During the 13th century, the majority of Estonians along the coasts were converted to Catholicism during the Livonian Crusade led by the Teutonic Order. During this time, the majority of Setos lived under the Novgorod Republic and remained followers of their native Finnic religion. Over the next two hundred years, the Setos were converted to Orthodox Christianity due to the influence from the neighboring Slavic states, but incorporated elements of their earlier pre-Christian religion. An early prevailing belief of the origin of the Seto community was that they were ethnic Estonians who had migrated east and adopted Orthodox Christianity under the influence of the Novgorod Republic.

The cultural development of the Setos blossomed in the early 20th century when many national societies were organized. In 1905, the number of Setos reached its peak. After the proclamation of independence of Estonia, the authorities adopted a policy of Estonification of its population, which eventually led to decline of the Setos as a distinctive community within Estonia. In Russia, due to the influence of Estonian language schools, high rates of inter-community marriages, and emigration to Estonia, the number of self-identifying Setos decreased as well. 

Setos are an officially protected ethnic minority in the Russian Pskov Oblast, and a linguistic minority within Estonia. In 2002, at the sixth Seto Congress the Setos declared their intent to identify as a separate people group. In a 2011 census, it was discovered that nearly two-thirds of the nearly 12,500 Seto speaking population in Estonia lived outside the historically Seto regions. This resulted in two distinct communities of Setos to emerge according to research conducted by Pille Runnel, the first being the Seto who had migrated away from Setomaa and had to recreate a communal and religious identity. The second group being the Seto people who continued to live in older communities in Setomaa.

== The border issue ==
In 1920, with the peace treaty of Tartu, the area Setomaa (Setoland) was ceded to the newly created Republic of Estonia and it was included into Petseri County. As a result of World War II, the Republic of Estonia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union. And on August 15, 1944, the border between the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was revised by Moscow authorities to what it is now. The issue became topical as the Republic of Estonia was restored in the borders of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991, and a national border was established soon afterwards.

== Seto ==

In 2009, the Setos&#x27; polyphonic style of folk singing, called , was added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. Seto is usually performed by women, dressed in traditional clothing. During the Seto Kingdom Day celebration, the winning lead singer of a group is awarded the title Mother of Song.

== Representative organizations ==
The Seto Congress, a body comprising representatives of Seto villages and organizations, is regularly convened every three years and elects a permanent Council of Elders.

The Society for Seto Congress was a member of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages. The Setomaa federation of municipalities in Estonia (, comprising the communes of Mikitämäe, Värska, Meremäe and Misso) publishes the newspaper &quot;Setomaa&quot;, partly in the Seto language, partly in Estonian.

Also, every year, the Seto choose a steward of King Peko ( or ) for the so-called Kingdom of Setomaa at the annual celebration of the Day of the Kingdom (), a local festival that rotates among the bigger Seto villages. The office is largely ceremonial and has been held by local activists, politicians, entrepreneurs and scholars. The tradition was initiated by , an ethnic Seto and a researcher of Seto folk songs and traditional vocal polyphony () at the University of Tartu.

== Religion ==
The Pskovo-Pechersky Monastery in Petseri has been an important religious and communal center for the Seto peoples. Since medieval times the monastery has owned much of the land and the Seto Churches in the region leading many Seto peasants to view the monastery as the economic and theological center of their community.

In 1920 with the independence of the Republic of Estonia from Soviet Russia, the border was drawn to include the monastery on the Estonia side. This prevented it from being desecrated or demolished by the Soviet forces during the anti-religious campaign from 1921-1928. Following the occupation by the German and Soviet forces from 1940-1991, the restoration of Estonian independence led the border to be moved, dividing the ancestral Seto lands and placing the monastery on side of the Russian Federation.

With the revival of Seto culture following the fall of the Soviet Union, elements of the pre-Christian religion that were preserved in private during the periods of Christianization and Sovietization began to reemerge. Since 2007, Jumalamägi, God&#x27;s Hill, an ancient sacred grove that was dedicated to the God-King Peko, who would carry spirits to the afterlife in his horse wagon, has again become a center of communal activity. Recently, a sculpture by local sculptor R. Veeber was erected on the hill and has become an important location for offers to Peko by the local community.

== Genetics ==
Based on 56 samples, the most common mtDNA haplogroup for Setos is H, as 42.9 percent of them belong to it. 33.9 percent of Setos have the haplogroup U, and its most frequently found subclade is U5. Less common mtDNA haplogroups include J, T and V.

<text>The 1784 British general election resulted in William Pitt the Younger securing an overall majority of about 120 in the House of Commons of Great Britain, having previously had to survive in a House which was dominated by his opponents.

==Background==
In December 1783, George III engineered the dismissal of the Fox–North coalition, which he hated, and appointed William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister. Pitt had very little personal support in the House of Commons and the supporters of Charles James Fox and Lord North felt that the constitution of the country had been violated. The doctrine that the government must always have a majority in the House of Commons was not yet established and Fox knew he had to be careful.

On 2 February 1784 Fox carried a motion of no confidence which declared &quot;That it is the Opinion of this House, That the Continuance of the present Ministers in their Offices is an Obstacle to the Formation of such an Administration as may enjoy the Confidence of this House, and tend to put an End to the unfortunate Divisions and Distractions of the Country&quot; by 223 to 204. Pitt remained in office, and government supporters ensured petitions and resolutions of borough corporations were presented to Parliament to encourage members to back Pitt, and slowly Members changed sides.

By 1 March, Fox&#x27;s motion which concluded by &quot;beseech[ing] His Majesty, that He would be graciously pleased to lay the Foundation of a strong and stable Government, by the previous Removal of His present Ministers&quot; was carried but only by 201 to 189. A week later, a more strongly worded motion threatening the withholding of supply was also passed—but only by 191 to 190. Fox thereafter declined to push motions, as his base continued to crumble. Pitt meanwhile decided to go to the country and on 24 March, Parliament was prorogued and on the following day the Parliament first elected in 1780 was dissolved.

==Course of the election==

The election was fought very much as a national campaign around the questions of the fall of the Fox–North government and whether or not Pitt should continue in office, rather than a series of local campaigns, which was more common for 18th century British elections.

Thanks to a combination of patronage and bribes paid by HM Treasury, many small pocket boroughs returned Pitt-supporting MPs as widely expected. Additionally, in the constituencies decided by large electorates there was massive support for candidates who backed Pitt. Many of Fox&#x27;s supporters were forced either to withdraw or to make deals with their opponents to avoid electoral defeat. In the county constituencies only one Fox supporter was elected in a contest, although others returned due to local electoral pacts. Those Members who had remained in opposition, refusing to go over to support Pitt, who failed to return to the House of Commons as a consequence, became known as &quot;Fox&#x27;s Martyrs&quot; in reference to John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot; (although the majority were supporters of North).

The first day&#x27;s polling, 30 March, saw thirteen government supporters and four opponents returned. By the conclusion of the fifth day (3 April), there were already more than 150 government Members and a lead of fifty over the supporters of the coalition. The government achieved an overall majority on 15 April and the election ended on 10 May.

==Notable contests==
===University of Cambridge===

The contests involving both Pitt and Fox attracted particular attention. Pitt had long wished to be a Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge and had failed to be elected when he stood for the seat in the 1780 general election. Now he was returned at the top of the poll and would hold the seat for the rest of his life.

===Westminster===
Fox was one of the two sitting members for the constituency of Westminster, which had the largest electorate of any in the country and a great deal of prestige. His position there was central to his claim to be representing the people. He stood against two Pitt supporters for the constituency&#x27;s two seats; both sides spent heavily, campaigned bitterly, allegedly libelled and slandered their opponents relentlessly and resorted to all kinds of tactics, including Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, touring the streets and, according to the opposition, kissing many voters to induce them to vote for Fox. Even George, Prince of Wales, campaigned for Fox.

At the conclusion of polling on 17 May, Fox had narrowly succeeded, with 6,233 votes to Sir Cecil Wray&#x27;s 5,998. However, Pitt&#x27;s supporters then demanded a scrutiny of the votes and the Returning Officer therefore did not make the return. A scrutiny in a constituency as large as Westminster was an enormously time-consuming process; Fox, suspecting this might happen, had already arranged for his return for the Tain Burghs, which had elected him on 26 April, so that he would not be out of the House during such a scrutiny. The process did not show unexpectedly large numbers of unqualified voters and as the months went by it looked more and more like a political delaying tactic; on 4 March 1785 the House of Commons finally put an end to it by ordering the Returning Officer to declare the result.

The election was notable for being one of the first in history in which visual propaganda, in the form of caricatures satirising or promoting the candidates, played a significant role. Caricatures appeared almost daily, allowing the young artists Thomas Rowlandson and James Gillray both to make their names on the strength of their satirical output. After the election, one of the leading London print sellers William Humphrey, gathered together a number the election plates to illustrate a detailed blow-by-blow account of the election. It quickly ran to a second edition. 

A London constable, Nicholas Casson, was killed during the election.

===Ipswich===
The election results were originally recorded as being 490 votes for William Fowle Middleton, 297 votes for John Cator (Whig) and 7 votes for Charles Crickitt (Tory). However Crickitt filed a petition against Cator&#x27;s election, accusing him of bribery. The petition was handled by Bamber Gascoyne, who was both Crickitt&#x27;s political agent and godfather. John Strutt acted on Crickitt&#x27;s behalf on the House of Commons committee which investigated the allegation. Crickitt also had the support of the Duke of Cumberland. Cator&#x27;s election was declared void and Crickett was seated in June 1784.

<doc id="1345590" wikidata="Q1395043" url="?curid=1345590" title="Janani Luwum">
<text>Janani Jakaliya Luwum was archbishop of the Church of Uganda from 1974 to 1977 and one of the most influential leaders of the modern church in Africa. He was arrested in February 1977 and died shortly after. Although the official account describes a car crash, it is generally accepted that he was murdered on the orders of then-President Idi Amin.

Since 2015 Uganda has a public holiday on 16 February, to celebrate the life of Janani Luwum.

== Early life ==
Luwum was born in the village of Mucwini in the Kitgum District to Acholi parents. He attended Gulu High School and Boroboro Teacher Training College, after which he taught at a primary school. Luwum converted to Christianity in 1948, and in 1949 he went to Buwalasi Theological College.

==Career==
In 1950 he was attached to St. Philip&#x27;s Church in Gulu. He was ordained a deacon in 1953, and the following year he was ordained a priest. He served in the Upper Nile Diocese of Uganda and later in the Diocese of Mbale. In 1969 he was consecrated Bishop of the Diocese of Northern Uganda at Gulu. After five years he was appointed Archbishop of the Metropolitan Province of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga (in Zaire), becoming the second African to hold this position.

==Arrest and death==

Archbishop Luwum was a leading voice in criticising the excesses of the Idi Amin regime that assumed power in 1971. In 1977, Archbishop Luwum delivered a note of protest to dictator Idi Amin against the policies of arbitrary killings and unexplained disappearances. Shortly afterwards the archbishop and other leading churchmen were accused of treason.

On 16 February 1977, Luwum was arrested together with two cabinet ministers, Erinayo Wilson Oryema and Charles Oboth Ofumbi. The same day Idi Amin convened a rally in Kampala with the three accused present. A few other &quot;suspects&quot; were paraded forth to read out &quot;confessions&quot; implicating the three men. The archbishop was accused of being an agent of the exiled former president Milton Obote, and for planning to stage a coup. The next day, Radio Uganda announced that the three had been killed when the car transporting them to an interrogation centre had collided with another vehicle. The accident, Radio Uganda reported, had occurred when the victims had tried to overpower the driver in an attempt to escape. When Luwum&#x27;s body was released to his relatives, it was riddled with bullets. Henry Kyemba, minister of health in Amin&#x27;s government, later wrote in his book &quot;A State of Blood&quot;, that &quot;The bodies were bullet-riddled. The archbishop had been shot through the mouth and at least three bullets in the chest. The ministers had been shot in a similar way but one only in the chest and not through the mouth. Oryema had a bullet wound through the leg.&quot;

According to the later testimony of witnesses, the victims had been taken to an army barracks, where they were bullied, beaten and finally shot. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said &quot;Some reports even had it that Amin himself had pulled the trigger, but Amin angrily denied the charge, and there were no first-hand witnesses&quot;. According to Vice President of Uganda Mustafa Adrisi and a Human rights commission, Amin&#x27;s right-hand man Isaac Maliyamungu carried out the murder of Luwum and his colleagues.

==Legacy==
Janani Luwum was survived by his widow, Mary Lawinyo Luwum and nine children. He was buried at his home village of Mucwini in the Kitgum District. Archbishop Luwum is recognized as a martyr by the Anglican Communion and his statue is among the Twentieth Century Martyrs on the front of Westminster Abbey in London. He is honored on the liturgical calendars of the Anglican Church of Australia, Anglican Church of Canada, Scottish Episcopal Church, and Church in Wales on 3 June. He is honored on the liturgical calendars of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil, Church of England and the Episcopal Church of the United States on 17 February.

=== Archbishop Janani Luwum Day ===
Archbishop Janani Luwum Day is a public holiday in Uganda, celebrated 16 February annually. The holiday is dedicated to the life and service of Janani Luwum, the former archbishop of the Anglican Church of Uganda, who is typically regarded as having been murdered on the orders of the then-President Idi Amin.

<text>Ravenglass is a coastal village in that lies between Barrow-in-Furness and Whitehaven, on the estuary of three rivers: the Esk, Mite and Irt. It is the only coastal village in the Lake District National Park. Formerly in the historical county of Cumberland, it is now part of the civil parish of Muncaster, the unitary authority of Cumberland, and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

==History==
The village dates back to at least the 2nd century, when it was an important naval base for the Romans. The Latin name of the settlement was long thought to be &quot;Glannoventa&quot;. The discovery of a lead seal in excavations at the Roman fort during the 1970s named the &quot;Cohors Prima Aelia Classica&quot; (First Cohort of Hadrian&#x27;s Marines). This unit is listed in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; as being garrisoned at &quot;Itunocelum&quot; during the fourth century. Due to this it was suggested that Ravenglass was not &quot;Glannoventa&quot; but actually the &quot;Itunocelum.&quot; Since the lead seal was discovered two other objects, a Roman military diploma from the beach by the fort at Ravenglass and a fragment of a Roman altar from Muncaster, have been found. These both name the &quot;Cohors Prima Aelia Classica&quot; and prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ravenglass was the Roman &quot;Itunocelum&quot;. The fort occupied the most southerly point of the Cumbrian coastal defence system, which can be seen as an extension of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the western extremity of the Roman frontier World Heritage Site.

Ravenglass was occupied by the Romans for over 300 years and had a Roman garrison (castra) of 500 soldiers. The town was a regional supply point for much of north-western Roman Britain, with a road from Ravenglass over the Hardknott Pass to the Roman forts at Hardknott and Ambleside. The location is featured in &quot;The Fort at River&#x27;s Bend&quot;, a book in Jack Whyte&#x27;s A Dream of Eagles (Camulod Chronicles) series, and is also mentioned briefly in Mary Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot; trilogy under the name &quot;Clannoventa&quot;. Today, there are few Roman remains, with the notable exception of a bath house, known locally as &quot;Walls Castle&quot;. This is one of the largest remaining Roman structures in England, originally covering an estimated area of by and with walls up to high, though only one end is now visible. Excavations of the rest of the foundations have since been covered and are not visible. The property is now maintained by English Heritage. 

Approximately a mile&#x27;s walk from the bath house is Muncaster Castle, which it is believed was built partly with the remains of a Roman fort which was located near Ravenglass. The grade II listed Muncaster War Memorial, designed by Edwin Lutyens, sits between Muncaster and Ravenglass.

&#x27;Renglas&#x27; appears in charters and other records of the late 12th century. In 1208 King John granted Richard de Lucy, Earl of Egremont a charter for a market at Ravenglass on Saturdays and a yearly fair on the festival of St. James, 5 August. In 1297 Ravenglass was described as a port along with Lancaster, Cartmel and Workington.

Ravenglass is reputed to be the birthplace of Saint Patrick.

==Etymology==
There are multiple explanations of the origin of the name &quot;Ravenglass&quot;. One is that it may be derived from, or from words equivalent to Welsh &quot;yr afon glas&quot;, meaning &quot;the greenish or blueish river&quot;. The name may also be of Norse-Irish origin, containing the Irish personal name &quot;Glas&quot; and meaning &quot;Glas&#x27;s part or share&quot;. The terminal element might be Gaelic &quot;glas&quot;, &quot;small stream&quot;. Also suggested is derivation from the Old Norse personal name &quot;Hrafnkell&quot;, suffixed with Old Norse &quot;óss&quot;, &quot;estuary&quot;.

==Governance==
Administrarively, Ravenglass is within the civil parish of Muncaster and the unitary authority of Cumberland, both of which have elected councils and are responsible for different aspects of local government. At the national level, Ravenglass is within the Barrow and Furness constituency.

Before Brexit, Ravenglass&#x27;s residents were covered by the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency.

==Attractions==
Tourist attractions include Muncaster Castle and the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway.

==Transport==
Ravenglass is served by Ravenglass railway station on the Cumbrian Coast railway line, with trains to Carlisle and Lancaster. This station is also a terminus of the narrow-gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, which runs inland up Eskdale. This serves both as a tourist attraction and as local transport during its operating season.

Ravenglass is connected by a minor road to the nearby A595 trunk road. It also has minor tracks running northwards and southwards via tidal fords, which are unsuitable for normal motor vehicles.

==In literature==

Eskdale and Rafnglass (modern Ravenglass) feature in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s final novel (1992) &quot;Sword Song&quot;, set in the 9th century. The 1972 Granada television serial The Intruder - based on the novel of the same name by John Rowe Townsend - was predominantly filmed in Ravenglass which represented the fictional location of Skirlston.

<text>The Connecticut State Police (CSP) is the state police and highway patrol of the U.S. state of Connecticut, responsible for statewide traffic regulation and law enforcement, especially in areas not served by (or served by smaller) municipal police. It is a division of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. The CSP currently has about 875 troopers as of June 28, 2022, and is headquartered in Middletown, Connecticut. The Connecticut State Police is also responsible for protecting the Governor of Connecticut, Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut, and their families.

==History==

===Early history===
The Connecticut State Police was created under House Bill #247 on May 29, 1903. Initially, five men, paid three dollars a day, were hired to enforce state liquor and vice laws, making it one of the oldest State Police forces in the nation. It was originally composed of five troopers primarily responsible for interdicting the production of moonshine. Early troopers traveled the state by railroad until automobile and motorcycle patrols were instituted, and troopers would often spend five to six days working, eating, and sleeping in the barracks constructed around the state. By 1924, seven such barracks had been built. The organization was heavily militaristic, and its internal culture was similar in this regard to other state police agencies in New England.

===Modern history===
In 1968 Louise Smith graduated from the State Police Academy becoming the first black woman to join a state police force in the United States.

In 1984 a federal judge found that the State Police systematically discriminated against minorities and ordered the State Police to increase the number of minorities in specialist positions as well as increase minority promotion rates.

In 1987 the Connecticut State Police were sued by the Connecticut chapter of Men and Women for Justice for discriminating against Black and Hispanic officers and officer candidates as well as other Civil Rights Act violations. The State Police chose to settle the case and made an agreement that the State Police would hire at least 10% Black and Hispanic officers, an accurate reflection of the State’s demographics in the early 1980s. In 2018 the hiring practices of the State Police remained the minimum allowed under their legally binding agreement with 5% of officers being Black and 5% being Hispanic despite Black and Hispanic Americans constituting over 25% of Connecticut&#x27;s citizens in 2018.

In 1997 the Connecticut State Police was at the center of Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland’s Geargate scandal Surplus military equipment intended for the State Police was diverted by Rowland and close associates for their personal use. Equipment and apparel including sleeping bags, camouflage jackets, helmets, and a bayonet made their way into the hands of Rowland’s children, his staff, his security detail, and the husband of then Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell. The diversion was organized by State Trooper Eugene D’Angelo and was uncovered through a joint State Police and Department of Defense investigation.

In 2015 State Police Troop H and Troop C were among six Connecticut police departments singled out in a state report on racial bias in policing for having the most &quot;significant disparities in their traffic stops data,” in particular traffic stop rates for Black and Hispanic drivers were much higher during the day when officers can easily visually establish the ethnicity of a driver before a stop than at night. The report was the most comprehensive report of its kind ever compiled by a state at the time of its release.

On December 31, 2018, Stavros Mellekas took over as the commander of the Connecticut State Police, replacing George F. Battle.

==== Fake ticketing scandal ====
In June 2023, following a news report revealed that four state troopers had fabricated hundreds of traffic stop tickets, an audit released by researchers at the University of Connecticut and Northeastern University found that nearly 26,000 reports made to the state&#x27;s racial profiling database could not be corroborated, and that possibly over 58,000 falsified records were created. The audit found that the State Police overreported traffic infractions that were said to involve White non-Hispanic drivers, and underreported incidents which were said to involve Black or Hispanic drivers. State Police Colonel Stavros Mellekas said that the number of falsified records declined after 2018, and noted that no state resident received a fake ticket, but rather that state troopers made up fake traffic stops to skew information in the agency&#x27;s racial profiling system.

Upon its release, the report attracted concern from members of the Connecticut General Assembly and civil rights groups such as the ACLU, whose Connecticut chapter released a statement saying the ticket falsifications showed &quot;breathtaking disrespect&quot; for the state&#x27;s ban on racial profiling, and efforts to reduce systemic racism in policing.

By July, the scandal had drawn the scrutiny of numerous investigations. The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, which oversees the Connecticut State Police, received a subpoena from the federal Department of Transportation, and its Commissioner, James Rovella, stated that it could also receive an inquiry from the Justice Department. Separately, governor Ned Lamont appointed Deidre M. Daly, a former federal prosecutor, to investigate how the misconduct occurred, how it went unreported for years, and how to prevent future misconduct. While this was happening, state officials placed an officer on administrative leave after he reported motorists he interacted with as Native American when they belonged to other racial groups.

By August 4th, the United States Department of Justice announced it was taking over the investigation into the scandal. On August 10, the Connecticut State Police Union voted no confidence in the Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Projection, James Rovella, and the Colonel of the Connecticut State Police, Stavros Mellekas. The President of the Connecticut State Police Union complained that the two officials &quot;stood by idly, as you allowed others to publicly make false allegations, destroy the morale of our Troopers, and dismantle the reputation of the State Police&quot;. By this time, speculation over a civil rights component within the ongoing federal investigation began, as some lawyers commented that the federal government could enter into a consent decree with the state government if it found that the falsification of traffic stops was widespread enough to skew demographic data collected.

==Weapons==
In 2012, CSP transitioned to the SIG Sauer P220R .45 ACP pistol. Prior to this, the SIG Sauer P229 had been issued since 1996.

In June 2022, CSP began transitioning to the Glock 45 9mm fitted with a tactical light and night sights. Troopers also began carrying only two spare magazines as opposed to the three issued with the SIG P220R.

==Organization==
The Connecticut State Police is headquartered in Middletown, Connecticut.

===Troops===
The CSP is divided into 11 troops, each of which has a lieutenant troop commander, a master sergeant executive officer, several patrol sergeants, a detective unit, and a full complement of personnel for patrol. The &quot;resident troopers&quot; in that troop area are also assigned to the troop. Additionally, each troop has its own dispatchers and clerical unit, and most have one or more mechanics to service the fleet.

Some troops, because of their location, are tasked primarily with highway patrol functions while other troops in more rural areas serve as rural police, i.e.: response to crimes, patrol of towns and neighborhoods, and providing police services to many Connecticut towns that do not have police departments of their own. (Connecticut has no County Sheriff Departments).

*Troop A – Southbury
*Troop B – Canaan
*Troop C – Tolland
*Troop D – Danielson
*Troop E – Montville
*Troop F – Westbrook
*Troop G – Bridgeport
*Troop H – Hartford
*Troop I – Bethany
*Troop K – Colchester
*Troop L – Litchfield
*Troop H – BDL – Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Troop H – Hartford at BIA supports Airport security functions as airport police, incident investigation, and backs up the airport management. Troop H also works with the Customs and Border Protection and the DEA.

===Other units===
Other units organized by the CSP that are not divided by troops include:
* Statewide Organized Crime Investigative Task Force
* Statewide Narcotics Task Force
* Welfare Fraud Unit
* Criminal Intelligence Unit
* Fire Marshal Division
* Training Division
* Licensing and Permits Section
* Forensics Laboratory
* Photography and Identification unit
* Polygraph Unit
* Fleet management &amp; Purchasing
* Emergency Services Unit, including the following subunits:
** Aviation
** Bomb Squad
** SCUBA (Dive Team)
** K-9
** Tactical Units (SWAT)
** Mass Transit Security Explosive Detection Unit

The CSP also has a contingent of volunteer surgeons and volunteer chaplains.

==Vehicles==

Uniquely, the CSP uses a fleet consisting almost entirely of unmarked police cars, most commonly in grey, with or without custom-marked detachable roof-mounted lightbars. The reason for their use of unmarked cars is derived from their origin as a volunteer force that allowed troopers to use their personal vehicles; in the present, most CSP cruisers are issued, but they are also allowed for personal use, making the lack of a livery suitable. The models used by the CSP are most commonly typical police vehicles such as the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, Ford Police Interceptor Utility, Chevrolet Caprice, and Dodge Charger, but the CSP sometimes also uses vehicles not traditionally used by law enforcement, such as various assorted models from Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Buick, Toyota, and Mazda.

Though most of the CSP&#x27;s fleet is unmarked, there are still vehicles that do have markings. Each troop is issued one marked car featuring a livery consisting of white with CSP badging on the doors and blue-and-yellow pinstripes running along the length of the car; these are typically used for ceremonial purposes, parades, or community patrols. CSP police motorcycles are painted black with text identifying them as state trooper units on the sides and front windshield. CSP police helicopters use a livery of navy blue, black, maroon, and dark brown.

The CSP uses radar, lidar, and VASCAR systems for speed enforcement.

In September 2022, the CSP used a helicopter from the Massachusetts National Guard to locate illegal cannabis cultivation sites.

==Rank structure==
==Fallen officers==
Since the establishment of the Connecticut State Police, 26 troopers and 1 K9 have died in the line of duty.

<doc id="1345595" wikidata="Q6089823" url="?curid=1345595" title="It's All in Your Head (Eve 6 album)">
<text>It&#x27;s All in Your Head is the third studio album by American rock band Eve 6. The album was released on July 22, 2003 through RCA.

==Background==
Released right before they were dropped from RCA Records and subsequently went on hiatus in 2004. Although the album is praised by fans, it is considered an experimental album, which may explain the lackluster sales that led to the band&#x27;s release from their RCA contract. The first single, &quot;Think Twice&quot;, was a hit on alternative rock radio stations. The second single, &quot;At Least We&#x27;re Dreaming&quot;, highlighted a darker side of Eve 6. &quot;Girlfriend&quot; was intended to be the third single from the album, but Eve 6 was released from their contract with RCA before an official release.

The album art for &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Head&quot;, a headless man raising his arms, derives from a wood etching done by a friend of Max Collins. None of the design is computerized and is all from wood etchings.

<doc id="1345603" wikidata="Q17154963" url="?curid=1345603" title="Whitby Dunlops">
<text>The Whitby Dunlops were a Canadian senior ice hockey team in the Allan Cup Hockey league. The team began play in 2004, and is on a leave of absence as of the 2020–21 season.

Two previous teams have also played as the Whitby Dunlops. The first played in the OHA Senior A League from 1954 to 1960, winners of the 1958 World Ice Hockey Championships. The second was a junior ice hockey team for the 1962–63 season.

==Original Dunlops==
The original Whitby Dunlops were founded from the remnants of the former Oshawa Generals junior team of 1952–53. After the Hambly Arena fire destroyed the Generals home ice, the team was disbanded and some of the older players on the team along with coach and manager Wren Blair, became the Oshawa Truckmen and operated from Bowmanville, Ontario for the 1953–54 season.

In 1954, the Oshawa Truckmen were relocated to Whitby and were temporarily known as the Whitby Seniors, playing out of the Whitby Community Arena. The team was soon sponsored by the Dunlop Rubber Company, and renamed the Whitby Dunlops. The team started as a Senior B team, winning its division the first year. The following year the Dunlops moved up to the OHA Senior A League. The Dunlops won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as league champions in 1957 and 1959.

This Senior A team would go on to win two Allan Cups, the Canadian Senior Hockey Championship, in 1957 and 1959. Their 1957 win earned them the right to represent Canada at the 1958 World Ice Hockey Championships, where they won the World Championship. Notable members of the team are, former Whitby mayor Bob Attersley, former Toronto Maple Leafs captain Sid Smith and Boston Bruins president Harry Sinden. Harry Sinden was captain of the 1958 Dunlops, while former Leaf captain Sid Smith was a playing coach. The Town of Whitby honoured this great team for their incredible achievements with their induction into the Whitby Sports Hall of Fame.

As Canada&#x27;s representative to the 1958 World Championships, the team took an ocean liner to the championships in Norway because team manager Wren Blair was terrified of flying. Everyone was sick for six days because of the rough waters but the chance to restore Canada&#x27;s pride was worth it. After a 14-game exhibition tour of Europe the Dunlops competed at the World Championships in Oslo, Norway.

The 1958 Whitby Dunlops were inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.

===Season-by-season results===
== The Junior Dunlops ==
The Senior A Dunlops folded after 1960, and the void in Whitby was filled by the Whitby Mohawks, a junior ice hockey team for the 1960–61 season. The Mohawks played their first season as a Junior B team. After one season, they were promoted to play in the new Metro Junior A League.

In their third season, the Mohawks were renamed the Dunlops. Unlike the previous Senior A version of the Dunlops which descended in part from the Oshawa Generals, the Junior A team played against the revived Oshawa Generals during the 1962–63 season.

;Season-by-season results
*&quot;Competed in 1960 to 1962 seasons as the Whitby Mohawks&quot;.
==Current Dunlops==
The current Dunlops were revived by a group of 31 local business and hockey personalities led by former Bowmanville Eagles owner Mike Laing who became the president. The Dunlops were granted membership in the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Eastern Ontario Senior Hockey League for the 2004–2005 season. The first revived season for the Dunlops was a success on the ice, finishing second overall in the league with a 25-7-0 record. The team played in the league finals versus the Norwood Vipers losing the series in 6 games. The EOSHL was elevated from AA status to AAA status after the 2004–05 season, becoming eligible to contend for the Allan Cup.

In their second year the Dunlops finished in first place in the EOSHL. They prevailed in a rematch versus the Norwood Vipers, winning the league championship in a 6-game series for the Re/Max Upper Canada Realty Cup. The EOSHL champion Dunlops played the Major League Hockey champion Dundas Real McCoys defeating them 3 games to 1 in a best-of-five series for the J. Ross Robertson Cup. The Dunlops hosted the defending Allan Cup champions, Thunder Bay Bombers in a best-of-three series for the Renwick Cup played on three consecutive nights at Iroquois Park. The Dunlops defeated the Bombbers 2 games to 1 to win the Renwick Cup and the right to go to the 2006 Allan Cup, in Powell River, British Columbia. After losing their first game, Whitby reached the Allan Cup finals. The Dunlops lost 7–1 in the championship game to the host team, the Powell River Regals.

The Dunlops played their third season with a strong core of returning players to finish first overall in the EOSHL, and sweep through the playoffs defeating the Norwood Vipers in four games for the Re/Max Upper Canada Realty Cup. The Dunlops played the Major League Hockey champions Brantford Blast defeating them in 4 games, for the Robertson Cup. In the Ontario championship, Whitby downed the Kenora Thistles in two straight games to earn a second consecutive berth in the Allan Cup. After a tie in their first game, Whitby reached the Allan Cup finals with three wins in a row. The Dunlops lost 4–3 in the championship game to the Lloydminster Border Kings.

The Dunlops finished first overall in the regular season in the EOSHL. In the playoffs, Whitby defeated the Norwood Vipers 4–1, and the Simcoe County Tundras 4–0 to win the league championship. The Dunlops then defeated the Dundas Real McCoys 4–0 to win the Robertson Cup. This series win guaranteed the Dunlops a third consecutive appearance in the Allan Cup. In the 2008 Allan Cup, Whitby lost twice with one tie game.

The EOSHL folded and the Dunlops joined Major League Hockey.

On December 12, 2008, Dunlops player Don Sanderson fell without his helmet on the ice and struck his head during a fight. He had brain surgery the next day, but died on January 2, 2009. The OHA subsequently debated its rules for wearing hockey helmets, to be properly worn and securely fastened.

The Dunlops lost the MLH final to the Dundas Real McCoys 4-games-to-none.

<text>Iwan Müller, sometimes spelled Iwan Mueller (14 December 1786, Reval, Governorate of Estonia – 4 February 1854, Bückeburg), was a clarinetist, composer and inventor who at the beginning of the 19th century was responsible for a major step forward in the development of the clarinet, the air-tight pad.

== Biography ==
Müller was born in Reval (present-day Tallinn), at that time a city with a strong Baltic German community in the Governorate of Estonia, part of the Russian Empire. He became a chamber musician in Saint Petersburg before he was twenty. At the same time, he was constantly striving to improve the clarinet, with new types of keywork. At the time, the standard clarinet used flat brass plates covered in soft leather to cover the toneholes. Since these leaked air, the number of them had to be kept to a minimum, which meant that notes outside the main scale of the clarinet (&quot;accidentals&quot;) had to be obtained by complicated fingerings which were difficult to play quickly and rarely were in tune. Clarinets would have five or six keys, the bare minimum to obtain an acceptable chromatic scale.
Müller&#x27;s solution was the &quot;stuffed pad&quot;, originally made of kid leather stuffed with felt. These pads would &quot;bulge&quot;, such that in combination with countersunk tone holes (called Zwirl or twist or twister), would close the keyholes sufficiently tight to permit the use of an increased number of keys making the &quot;clarinette omnitonique&quot; possible.

In addition to the fingering system and felt pads, Müller is also known as the inventor of metal ligature (that replaced twine, string and wire, widely used in the past and still used today in German-speaking regions), which are used today in almost all single-reeded woodwind instruments.

Müller went on to work in Dresden, Berlin and Leipzig, where he specialized in the basset-horn, a type of low-pitched clarinet.

In 1809 Müller performed to great acclaim on a clarinet made to his own specifications. In that same year, Müller moved to Paris, gained the support of a wealthy patron, (Mr.) Marie-Pierre Petit, and started mass-producing clarinets.

In 1812 Müller presented his new 13-key clarinet with air-tight pads to the Paris Conservatoire, but they weren&#x27;t impressed. Nevertheless, Müller&#x27;s new clarinet with fully chromatic range became popular and became the standard clarinet for much of the 19th century. It was further developed into the Öhler system, the prevalent system in Germany today.
He was also, before the famous Hyacinthe Klosé, principal clarinet at the Théâtre Italien in Paris.

<doc id="1345605" wikidata="Q957009" url="?curid=1345605" title="Morris Peterson">
<text>Morris Russell Peterson Jr. (born August 26, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player who played eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Michigan State University, where in the 1999–2000 season he led the Spartans to the national title as Big Ten Player of the Year.

== College career ==
Born in Flint, Michigan, Peterson played collegiate basketball at Michigan State University, and helped lead them to the 2000 NCAA title.

In his senior year at MSU, Peterson led the team in scoring, field goal percentage, and free throw percentage. He had a team-high 30 double-digit scoring efforts. He was voted Big Ten Player of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten, and he placed as first or second team All-American on five different polls.

He was selected 21st overall by the Raptors in the 2000 NBA draft, and was a starter in the majority of their games during his first three seasons. On January 17, 2009, MSU retired his number 42 with MSU&#x27;s other all-time greats before their game against the Illinois Fighting Illini.

== NBA career ==

=== Toronto Raptors ===
Drafted in the first round by the Raptors in 2000, Peterson was a fan favorite from the moment he stepped on the floor.
While enjoying some early success in his professional career, Peterson&#x27;s production faced a steady decline, before stepping up in the wake of the new era of Raptor youngsters being ushered in, taking on a more expansive leadership role and transforming himself into an elite perimeter defender, a clutch performer and consistent scorer. He is known for his three-point shooting, acrobatic shots, defense, and fearless driving to the basket.

On December 28, 2005, Peterson set a record for career games played as a Raptor, surpassing Alvin Williams with 418 games played. Peterson also leads the NBA in longest consecutive games played, appearing in 371 straight until November 22, 2006, when he missed his first game in over four years.

Peterson posted career highs in points and rebounds averaging 16.8 points and 4.6 rebounds and threw in 2.3 assists per game through 82 games played in the 2005–06 season.

Perhaps the biggest highlight of his career occurred against the Washington Wizards on March 30, 2007, in a game that helped determine the two teams&#x27; playoff seeding. The Raptors trailed 109–106 with only 3.8 seconds left and no timeouts remaining. The Wizards&#x27; Michael Ruffin intercepted the full-court pass and tried to toss the ball high into the air so that the clock would run out. But the ball slipped from his hands and was not thrown high enough. There was still enough time on the clock as Peterson caught the ball and launched a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; three-pointer and sank it to send the game into overtime. Peterson only played 55 seconds in the game, with his first shift beginning with only 9.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Raptors went on to defeat the Wizards, 123–118.

After signing Bryan Colangelo, it became apparent that the re-building process of the Raptors would not include Peterson. It was only a matter of time before his contract expired in the summer of 2007 that he would be gone.

=== New Orleans Hornets ===
On July 13, 2007, the New Orleans Hornets signed Peterson to a four-year contract, worth $23 million.

=== Oklahoma City Thunder ===
On July 8, 2010, the Hornets traded Peterson along with #11 overall pick in the 2010 draft, Cole Aldrich, to the Oklahoma City Thunder for two 2010 first-round draft picks (#21, Craig Brackins and #26, Quincy Pondexter).

=== Charlotte Bobcats ===
On February 24, 2011, Peterson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats along with D.J. White in exchange for Nazr Mohammed. He was waived four days later when his contract was bought out by the Bobcats. Peterson&#x27;s final NBA game was played on December 12, 2010, in a 106 - 77 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers where he recorded 2 points.

== Broadcasting career ==
On January 14, 2015, TSN announced that Peterson would join their broadcast team as an analyst. For the network&#x27;s package of Toronto Raptors games, Peterson joined TSN&#x27;s broadcast team of Jack Armstrong, Leo Rautins, Matt Devlin, and Rod Black both in the TSN Studio and on-site at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Peterson will also deliver analysis for SportsCentre and appear throughout the network&#x27;s expanded NCAA coverage, including TSN&#x27;s wall-to-wall coverage of NCAA March Madness. As of 2017, Peterson is no longer an analyst on TSN.

== Restaurant ==
On January 23, 2018, Peterson, in a partnership with Viktor Palushaj, opened &quot;MoPetes Sports Retreat&quot; just outside of his hometown of Flint in neighboring Flint Township, Michigan. The menu features Michigan inspired dishes such as The Flintstones Combos, Flint-Town Reuben sandwich, the Izzo sub, and The National Champ Philly cheese steak sandwich.

== Accolades ==
* Career-high: March 31, 2006 Peterson scored a career-best 38 points vs. the Phoenix Suns.
* First-round draft choice (21st overall) by Toronto in 2000.
* Recorded his 800th career three-point field goal April 3, 2005 vs. the Detroit Pistons.
* Had a career-high 14 rebounds April 8, 2005.
* Held the longest active streak of games played, with 371, ending in 2006.
* Held Raptors career records for games played (542) and 3-point field goals (801).

<text>Sefton Park is a district within the city of Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom. The area is part of the Liverpool City Council Ward of Mossley Hill and is a designated conservation area.

The district surrounds the park from which it takes its name, Sefton Park, which was laid out in the 1860s. 
Greenbank House on Greenbank Lane dates from 1787, and was the home of the Rathbone family.

The original urbanisation of the area was mainly in the Victorian era, with large Victorian villas, particularly facing the park itself, and terraces and apartment blocks on nearby streets. In the 1820s, some wealthy members of the Chian diaspora settled here.

Lark Lane is lined with pubs, restaurants and specialist shops. 

The University of Liverpool has several halls of residence in the Sefton Park district.

There was a railway station called Sefton Park, a short distance away and confusingly facing a different park (Wavertree), but it closed in 1960. The line is still in use, and the station buildings at street level survive in the form of commercial premises. Little evidence of the station is visible at track level, above the road. The nearest railway stations still operating are St Michaels railway station and Mossley Hill railway station.

<doc id="1345618" wikidata="Q7784973" url="?curid=1345618" title="Jamestown supply missions">
<text>The Jamestown supply missions were a series of fleets (or sometimes individual ships) from 1607 to around 1611 that were dispatched from England by the London Company (also known as the Virginia Company of London) with the specific goal of initially establishing the company&#x27;s presence and later specifically maintaining the English settlement of &quot;James Fort&quot; on present-day Jamestown Island. The supply missions also resulted in the colonization of Bermuda as a supply and way-point between the colony and England.

The Jamestown colonists initially chose the fort&#x27;s location because it was favorable for defensive purposes. Although some of them did some farming, few of the original settlers were experienced farmers, and as hunters they quickly exhausted the area&#x27;s supply of small game. To make matters worse, the most severe drought in 700 years occurred between 1606 and 1612. Consequently, the colonists quickly became dependent upon trade with the Native Americans and periodic supply from England for their survival. Captain Christopher Newport was tasked with the duty of leading the first three re-supply missions back to Jamestown. However, it was not until a fourth mission under Lord Thomas West that the settlement was finally able to establish both defensive and food security.

==Original mission==

The London Company organized a for-profit expedition to establish a settlement in the Virginia territory in late 1606. The expedition consisted of three ships which set sail on December 20, 1606, from Blackwall, with 105 men and boys and 39 crew members. There were no women on the first ships.

The ships in this fleet were:
*&quot;Discovery, 20 tons,&quot; with Captain John Ratcliffe and 21 people
*&quot;Godspeed&quot;, 40 tons, with Captain Bartholomew Gosnold (serving as vice admiral) and 52 people
*&quot;Susan Constant&quot; - sometimes known as &quot;Sarah Constant&quot; - (flagship), 120 tons, with Captain Christopher Newport and 71 people

=== Voyage ===
The fleet headed south-west towards the Azores. Early in the voyage, on February 13, 1607, near the Canary Islands, Captain John Smith was charged with mutiny, and Newport had him arrested and planned to execute him upon arrival in the Caribbean (and later in Virginia). The execution was never carried out, after the colonists landed at Cape Henry on April 26, 1607, and unsealed orders from the Virginia Company designating Smith as one of the leaders of the new colony, thus sparing him from the gallows. Passing Martinique on March 23, they also visited Dominica, on March 28, Nevis, and St. Croix, where they replenished their water and food. By April 6, 1607, the fleet arrived at the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico, where they stopped for provisions before continuing their journey. They landed on Mona and Monito Islands on April 7 and left on April 9, the last stop before the mainland.

After an unusually long voyage of 144 days and the death of only one passenger, they made landfall on April 26, 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of what they named the James River on the Chesapeake Bay. A party of men then explored the area and had a minor conflict with some local &quot;Indians&quot;, so the colonists moved north. On , they finally chose Jamestown Island (at that time a peninsula), further upriver and on the northern shore, for their settlement, as it was a location that could be easily defended from attacks by other European states, notably the Dutch Republic, France, and Spain.

However, after the long voyage, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day. Further, the worst drought in 700 years occurred in the area between 1606 and 1612, affecting the Jamestown colonist&#x27;s and local Powhatan tribe&#x27;s ability to produce food and obtain a safe supply of water. In addition to settling, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the company. The early settlers were excited by the apparent availability of gold, and from the outset settlers attempted to produce timber for export, given the seemingly inexhaustible supply within Virginia&#x27;s virgin forests. However, they could not devote much time to developing commodity products, as they were too busy trying to survive. On June 22, 1607, Newport sailed back for London with &quot;Susan Constant&quot; and &quot;Godspeed&quot; carrying a load of supposedly precious minerals, leaving behind the 104 colonists and &quot;Discovery&quot; (to be used in exploring the area).

==John Smith (1607)==
Using &quot;Discovery&quot; and some assembled shallops left to the colony, Smith undertook three exploratory voyages of the Chesapeake Bay and along the various rivers seeking a supply of food for the colonists in June, July, and August 1607. However, while leading one food-gathering expedition in December 1607, this time up the Chickahominy River west of Jamestown, his men were set upon by Pamunkey natives, and Smith was captured. After being &quot;saved&quot; by Pocahontas, Smith returned alone to Jamestown just in time for the first supply in January 1608.

==First supply mission==
Arriving back in London on August 12, 1607, Newport delivered a letter from the council alongside his cargo of &quot;gold&quot; (which was quickly determined to be iron pyrite). He was then put in charge of the urgently needed re-supply mission, containing a few provisions and more than 70 additional colonists.

The ships were:

*&quot;John and Francis&quot; with Captain Christopher Newport
*&quot;Phoenix&quot; with Francis Nelson

===Voyage===
The first re-supply fleet, tracing the same route as the original fleet, arrived at the colony on January 2, 1608. Upon his return, Newport found that the effects of the lack of planning and lack of skills amongst the original colonists, combined with Powhatan attacks, had quickly reduced the original settlement to only 38 survivors. However, despite replenishing the colony&#x27;s supplies, the two ships also brought an additional 120 men (settlers and crew), as recorded later by Smith.

This proved troublesome, particularly when a few days later the fort caught fire, destroying most of the existing buildings, food, and supplies. Despite their original intention to grow food locally and trade with the local natives, the barely-surviving colonists became increasingly dependent upon external supply missions. After expanding fortifications, rebuilding shelters, and placing armed men to defend crops from native attacks, Newport felt he had sufficiently re-secured the settlement by the end of winter. Accordingly, he departed again for England on April 10, 1608, with another cargo of &quot;gold&quot;. In his absence, the meagre food supplies quickly ran low, and although Native Americans brought some food, Smith wrote that &quot;more than half of us died&quot;.

== John Smith explorations (1608) ==
Smith ventured into the Chesapeake Bay twice more in 1608, in the months between the first and second supply missions, charged by the company to search for gold and a passage to the Pacific Ocean. The first trip lasted from June 2 to July 21; a second, longer expedition spanned July 24 to September 7. Searching for badly needed food, he covered an estimated 3,000 miles (4,828 km), producing a map that was of great value to local explorers for more than a century. This time he successfully traded for food with the Nansemonds along the Nansemond River, and several other groups. He had mixed results dealing with the various other tribes, most of whom were affiliated with the Powhatan Confederacy. These explorations were later commemorated in the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, established in 2006.

== Second supply mission ==

Newport and the ships arrived back in London on May 21, 1608, and despite another disappointment with false gold, an additional re-supply trip was quickly organized. Urgently needed supplies and 70 additional settlers were gathered, including Thomas Graves, Thomas Forrest and Forrest&#x27;s wife &quot;Mistress Forrest and Anne Burras her maide&quot; (the first women known to have come to Jamestown).

Also included were the first non-English settlers. The company recruited these as skilled craftsmen and industry specialists: soap-ash, glass, lumber milling (wainscot, clapboard, and ‘deal’ — planks, especially soft wood planks) and naval stores (pitch, turpentine, and tar). Among these additional settlers were eight &quot;Dutch-men&quot; (probably German or German-speakers), Polish (see Jamestown Polish craftsmen) and Slovak craftsmen, who had been hired to help develop and manufacture profitable export products. William Volday (Wilhelm Waldi), a Swiss German mineral prospector, was also among those who arrived in 1608. His mission was seeking a silver reservoir that was believed to be within the proximity of Jamestown. Some of the settlers were the artisans who built a glass furnace which became the first factory in America.

The ship was:
* &quot;Mary Margaret&quot; (sometimes &quot;Mary and Margaret&quot;) with Captain Christopher Newport
===New colonists manifest===
A manifest of &quot;new colonists&quot; in the second fleet was recorded, in Volume 1 of &quot;The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles&quot; by Captain John Smith, published 1624.&quot;&quot; Master Francis West and mariners on the voyage are omitted from the document.

===Voyage===
Newport&#x27;s instructions were to search for any survivors of the Lost Colony of Roanoke, resume exploring for gold mines, and stage a &quot;coronation&quot; of Powhatan, making him a &quot;sub-king&quot; under James I. On October 1, 1608, the supply ship arrived following a journey of approximately three months. Following his orders, Newport searched for the lost colonists and gold mines and attempted a coronation, all without success.

He then returned to England, this time not with iron pyrite but with products of the New World including: &quot;clapboard, wainscot, pitch, tarre, glasse, frankincense, and sope ashes&quot;. He arrived in London in mid-January 1609, and despite all these efforts, profits from these early exports were not sufficient to meet the expenses and expectations of the investors back in England, and no New-World silver or gold had been discovered, as earlier imagined. Despite these disappointments, the need for another, ideally much larger supply mission was conveyed to the leaders of the company.

==Samuel Argall==
In early 1609, Captain Samuel Argall, as an employee of the London Company, was commissioned to develop a shorter, more direct route for sailing from England across the Atlantic Ocean to the colony at Jamestown. He was also ordered to fish for sturgeon on the voyage. Rather than following the normal practice of going south to the tropics and west with the trade winds, Argall, aboard &quot;Mary and John&quot;, sailed west from the Azores to the Bermuda area, then almost due west to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. This voyage took only nine weeks and six days, including two weeks becalmed (compared to the three to five months of previous fleets), enabling the English to save on provisions and to also avoid hostile Spanish ships.

Upon his arrival at Jamestown, Argall found the colonists in dire straits, since in April an infestation of rats had been discovered, along with dampness, which had destroyed all their stored corn. He resupplied the colony with all the food and wine he could spare (which Smith bought on credit), and also brought the news that the company was being reorganized and was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown along with a new governor. Argall then returned to England at the end of the summer of 1609. His unexpected help was significant, in that it came to the colony at one of the most critical moments in its history, as it preceded the Starving Time, and without the provisions Argall had left, the colony may have been totally destroyed.

==Third supply mission==
On May 23, 1609, King James issued a new charter for the company to allow for reorganization and additional capital. Company treasurer Thomas Smythe organised a major supply mission, with the goal to rescue the failing settlement. It consisted of nine ships, between 500 and 600 passengers, including women and children, livestock and enough provisions to last a year in &quot;the largest fleet England has ever amassed in the West&quot;. Newport, as vice-admiral, commanded &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, the new flagship of the company, which had been specially built for the purpose. It was considerably larger than the other eight ships, and carried a large proportion of the supplies intended for the colony. Also aboard the flagship were Admiral George Somers, William Strachey, Silvester Jourdain, Ralph Hamor, and Thomas Gates, people notable in the early history of English colonization in North America. On June 2, 1609, the fleet departed Plymouth, England.

The ships were:
# &quot;Blessinge&quot; with Captain Gabriel Archer and Captain Robert Adams
# &quot;Catch&quot; (ketch or pinnace) with Master Matthew Fitch
# &quot;Diamond&quot; (second largest) with Captain John Ratcliffe and Captain William King
# &quot;Faulcon&quot; (third largest) with Captain John Martin and Master Francis Nelson
# &quot;Lion&quot; with Captain George Webb
# &quot;Sea Venture&quot; (largest ship and flagship) with Captain Christopher Newport, Fleet Admiral George Somers, and Lt. General Thomas Gates
# &quot;Swallow&quot; with Captain John Moone
# &quot;Unitie of London&quot; with Captain Wood and Master Robert Pitt
# &quot;Virginia&quot; (rigged pinnace; first ship built in Colonial America) with Captain James Davis and Master Robert Davis

===Voyage===
The fleet stayed together for seven weeks as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean, save for &quot;Virginia&quot; (which returned to England from the Azores). On July 25, the fleet ran into a massive &#x27;tempest&#x27;, believed to have been a hurricane, which lasted for three days, and all became separated. After the storm, &quot;Blessinge&quot;, &quot;Faulcon&quot;, &quot;Lion&quot;, and &quot;Unitie&quot; came together and headed for Virginia, &quot;falling into the James River&quot; on August 11. &quot;Diamond&quot; appeared a few days later, and &quot;Swallow&quot; a few days after that (around August 18). &quot;Virginia&quot; arrived some six weeks later on October 3. All in all, seven ships arrived safely at Jamestown, delivering most of the colonists but relatively few supplies. In the colony, there was no word of the fate of &quot;Sea Venture&quot; (which had been wrecked in Bermuda) or &quot;Catch&quot; (which had been lost at sea), including the supplies, passengers, and leaders who had been aboard them. Four of the ships harbored sufferers of yellow fever, while &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot; brought bubonic plague to the colony, killing at least 30 emigrants on the journey (and more over the following months).

&quot;Blessing&quot;, &quot;Diamond&quot;, &quot;Falcon&quot;, and &quot;Unitie&quot; returned to England on October 14 to advise of Jamestown&#x27;s plight carrying Captain Samuel Argall, an injured John Smith, and 30 young men sent from England but rejected by the colony. However, no further supply ships from England arrived that year nor the following spring. In the absence of strong leadership and most of the supplies, all of which had been aboard &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, the existing and newly-brought settlers at James Fort were ill-prepared to survive the winter, resulting in the siege and &quot;Starving Time&quot; of 1609-1610, when most of the inhabitants perished.

===&quot;Sea Venture&quot;===
During the tropical storm, &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was separated from the seven other vessels of the third supply fleet and began taking on water through her new caulking. On July 28 and with bailing efforts failing, Somers had the ship deliberately driven onto the reefs at Discovery Bay in eastern Bermuda to prevent her sinking. The 150 passengers and crew members all landed safely, but the ship was disabled. Over a period of nine months, the survivors built two pinnaces—&quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;—using local Bermuda cedar and hardware salvaged from the wreck. The original plan was to build only one vessel, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, but it soon became evident that one would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the supplies that were being sourced on the islands. During the building, &quot;Sea Venture&quot;&#x27;s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown, but neither it nor its crew were ever seen again. The named ships were provisioned with salvaged and local goods—from Bermuda the crew were able to gather pork from feral pigs, sweet potatoes, and onions, figs and olives from stock grown in Bermuda.

The vessels disembarked on May 20, 1610. By May 23 they had reached Old Point Comfort. The survivors of &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, led by Gates and Somers, assumed they would find a thriving colony in Virginia. Instead, they found the colony in ruins and practically abandoned. Of the 500 or so colonists living in Jamestown in the autumn, they found only 60 survivors with many of those also sick or dying. Worse yet, many supplies intended for Jamestown had been lost in Bermuda, and Gates and Somers had brought along with them about 140 additional people but only a small food supply. The decision was made to abandon James Fort, and on June 7 everyone boarded &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Virginia&quot; to return to England.

==Francis West==
In the interval between the departure of Smith for England and the arrival of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; survivors, George Percy became president of the council in Jamestown. He however accomplished little while in charge, other than to order to construction of Fort Algernon at Old Point Comfort. To secure food, he had sent Francis West and James Davis up the Chesapeake Bay to obtain corn from the Patawomeck in 1609, but instead of delivering that food to the starving colony, West sailed the &quot;Swallow&quot; directly back to England and avoided the Starving Time by abandoning Percy and the colonists. Percy wrote later that when West brought his ship loaded with corn back to Point Comfort, the captain in charge of Fort Algernon told everyone about the hunger at Jamestown, and instead of hurrying upstream to feed the colonists, &quot;Captain Weste, by the persuasion, or rather by the enforcement, of his company hoised up sails and shaped by their course directly for England, and left us in that extreme misery and want.&quot;

==&quot;Fourth&quot; supply mission==

During the period that &quot;Sea Venture&quot; suffered its misfortune and its survivors were struggling in Bermuda to continue on to Virginia, the publication of Smith&#x27;s books of his adventures in England sparked a resurgence of interest and investment in the company. There was also a religious call in England by clergymen and others to support the stranded colonists. Another mission was prepared, equipped with additional colonists, a doctor, food, and supplies, and heading this group was Francis West&#x27;s older brother, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who also recruited and equipped an armed contingent of 150 men at his own expense.

The ships were:
*&quot;Blessing of Plymouth&quot;
* &quot;De La Warr&quot; with Admiral Thomas West and Samuel Argall
* &quot;Hercules of Rye&quot;

===Voyage===
West and his fleet departed London on March 12, 1610, and arrived on the James River on June 9, just as the existing colonists were sailing downriver to leave Virginia. Intercepting them about 10 miles (16 km) downstream from Jamestown near Mulberry Island, West ordered the ships to return to the abandoned colony. This was not a popular decision at the time, but it proved to be a turning point in the English colonization of North America.

==Subsequent supply missions==

After the return to Jamestown, the settlement had a population of around 375. Captain Robert Tyndall was directed to take &quot;Virginia&quot; to catch fish in the Chesapeake Bay between Cape Henry and Cape Charles. On June 19, 1610, Somers, not wanting to be subordinate to West, departed for Bermuda aboard &quot;Patience&quot;, accompanied by Captain Argall on &quot;Discovery&quot;, with the intention of gathering more food, including fish, sweet potatoes, and live pigs for Jamestown. Blown north towards Newfoundland, the ships became separated in thick fog. Argall attempted fishing before returning, reaching the Chesapeake on August 31, while Somers, who had continued on to Bermuda, became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on November 2 before completing the mission. Captain Matthew Somers, in charge of &quot;Patience&quot; and probably keen to secure his uncle&#x27;s inheritance disobeyed orders by returning to Lyme Regis, England, with the preserved body of his uncle. He was able to provide an update to the company on the status of the colony.

On July 25, 1610, &quot;Hercules&quot; with Captain Adams was sent from Jamestown for supplies. It returned &quot;soon after&quot; the departure of Thomas West, who had left Virginia for the island of Mevis in &quot;De La Warr&quot; on April 7, 1611. &quot;Blessing&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot; returned to England in September 1610 with Gates, Newport, Adams, and &quot;others from Virginia&quot;. When the Jamestown garrison again required provisions in December 1610, Captain Argall was dispatched to the Potomac River and procured maize and furs there from Iopassus (Japazaws), a Patawomeck town. 

Newport, Vice-Admiral of Virginia, and Sir Thomas Dale, lieutenant Governor or Marshall of Virginia, left England in March 1611 for Jamestown with a fleet of three ships, 300 people, and supplies including horses and livestock. Sailing via Dominica and Puerto Rico, they arrived at Point Comfort on May 22, 1611. The ships were &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Prosperous&quot;, and &quot;Starr&quot;. The last major fleet of this time, under Sir Thomas Gates, lieutenant General of Virginia, sailed from England towards the end of May 1611 with three ships, 280 men, 20 women, 200 cattle, and &quot;many swine and other necessaries&quot;. They sailed via the West Indies and arrived in Virginia on August 30. The ships were &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Swan&quot;, and &quot;Trial&quot;.

==Impact==

By 1610, with the end of the Starving Time, the majority of the colonists who had arrived at the Jamestown settlement had died, and its economic value was negligible with no active exports to England and very little internal economic activity. Only financial incentives including a promise of more land to the west from King James I to investors financing the colony kept the project afloat. The timely arrival of West and the “Fourth” fleet in 1610 resulted in a renovation of the settlement and a counter-offensive against the Powhatan Confederacy, whose refusal to trade and siege of the fort had threatened the food security of the colony. The campaign ended the Powhatan siege and resulted in the marriage of Pocahontas and John Rolfe (a &quot;Sea Venture&quot; survivor) which introduced a short truce between the English and the Powhatan Confederacy.

This allowed the English to fully secure the colony&#x27;s fortifications and housing, expand its farming, develop a network of alliances with other Indian nations, and establish a series of outlying smaller settlements. Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, and the company continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, governors Gates and Dale continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smythe in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send to Jamestown. By 1612, Rolfe successfully pioneered strains of tobacco that allowed the colony to cultivate and export its own cash crop, thereby ensuring a form of financial security.

<text>The River Esk, sometimes called the Cumbrian Esk, is a river in Cumbria, England. It flows for approximately 25 km (15.5 miles) from its source in the Scafells range of mountains to its estuary at Ravenglass. The valley it flows through is known as Eskdale. It is one of two Rivers Esk in Cumbria, and not to be confused with the Border Esk which flows into Cumbria from Scotland.

In his book &quot;The Origins Of English Place Names&quot;, P. H. Reaney says that the river&#x27;s name is derived from the Brythonic word &quot;*Iska&quot; (&quot;abounding in fish&quot;) and cognate with the modern Welsh word &quot;Pysg&quot; (&quot;fishes&quot;). This derivation applies to many similarly named rivers throughout Britain including the Axe, Exe and Usk, the names evolving local distinctions over the centuries.

The Esk is, in part, paralleled by the narrow-gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway and as a consequence the railway has named one of its steam locomotives after the river.

== Course ==

The Esk rises in the Scafells range of mountains at a height of , just below Esk Hause, the mountain pass between the fells of Great End and Esk Pike. The infant river then flows southerly through wild and picturesque countryside, devoid of any road access. It receives many streams flowing off the Scafell range, the most significant of which are Calfcove Gill and Little Narrowcove Beck. The river makes several leaps over waterfalls including the Esk Falls before being joined by its first major tributary, Lingcove Beck, at Lingcove Bridge. 

Some downstream of Lingcove Bridge, the river passes Brotherilkeld Farm, which formerly belonged to the monks of Furness Abbey, and the nearby Hardknott Roman Fort. At this point the Esk is joined by the Hardknott Beck, which is accompanied by the motor road that has crossed Hardknott Pass on its route from the central Lake District to the sea. The river now flows westerly through the farmland of Eskdale, roughly paralleled by the road.

A further downstream of Brotherilkeld Farm, the church of St Catherine lies on the riverbank. This serves the small village of Boot, although the actual village lies north on the bank of the Whillan Beck. This significant tributary joins the Esk just downstream, at Beckfoot, and is the outflow from Burnmoor Tarn. For about the next the Esk is paralleled by the narrow-gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, before both the railway and the principal road turn north through the village of Eskdale Green and a route west via the valley of the River Mite. 

The river, however, continues in a south westerly direction on the southern side of Muncaster Fell. Here it passes Hinning House bridge, east of Ravenglass where the river becomes tidal, and Muncaster Bridge, where it passes under the A595 coast road and takes on an estuarial character. The estuary then passes the grounds of Muncaster Castle and under the Cumbrian Coast railway line on Eskmeals Viaduct before turning north to reach Ravenglass and the Irish Sea.
At Ravenglass, the Esk estuary is joined by the rivers Irt and Mite. The estuary has evolved over the centuries; the Esk and Irt were earlier separated by a shingle bank formed by the sea, and dunes formed when they eventually joined together. The estuary dunes are the location of the Eskmeals nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) over an area of 165.5 acres (67 hectares). The SSSI is made up of mostly coastal dunes and salt marsh attracting breeding birds and a profusion of flowers. The dunes are also the site of the Eskmeals Range, a shooting range owned by the MOD and operated by the contractor Qinetiq.

==Ecology==
The Environment Agency defines three waterbodies for the non-tidal part of the River Esk, including its catchment area and tributaries. The &quot;Esk (South West Lakes)&quot; waterbody comprises the area up to the confluence with the Whillan Beck, the &quot;Esk (upper)&quot; comprises the area along the Esk above that confluence, and the &quot;Whillan Beck&quot; comprises the area along the Whillan Beck above that confluence. In 2022, the &quot;Esk (South West Lakes)&quot; and &quot;Whillan Beck&quot; waterbodies were classified as having a good ecological status, whilst &quot;Esk (upper)&quot; had a moderate ecological status.

The Esk has a reputation as a very good fishing river; it offers fine angling for sea trout and salmon. It was made famous by the writer and broadcaster Hugh Falkus, who lived in the Esk valley and used the river as a basis for many of his books and films. Many of the angling locations on the Esk are privately owned, although the Millom Angling Association offers daily tickets for visitors at its sites on the Muncaster Castle Estate and Brant Rake.

==Topography==
The valley of the River Esk is notable in being one of few major valleys in the Lake District not to have its own lake, although several tarns are perched above the valley sides. The main access to the valley is from the western end; however, there is also a steep pass with a motor road leading out of the valley to the east over Hardknott Pass, as well as a road with beautiful views leading southwards over Birker Fell to the village of Ulpha in the Duddon Valley.

Alfred Wainwright in his guide &quot;Walks from Ratty&quot; describes Eskdale as &quot;One of the loveliest of Lakeland&#x27;s valleys, descends from the highest and wildest mountains in the district to the Sands of Ravenglass in a swift transition from bleak and craggy ridges to verdant woodlands and pastures watered by a charming river.&quot; Upper Eskdale is a remote wilderness surrounded by Sca Fell, Scafell Pike, Ill Crag, Esk Pike, Bow Fell and Crinkle Crags; the Woolpack walk takes in this classic horseshoe.

The upper part of the valley lies within the civil parish of Eskdale, whilst the lower part is within the civil parish of Muncaster. Both are within the unitary authority of Cumberland and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

<text>A Eurohound (also known as a European [[sled dog]] or Scandinavian [[hound]]) is a type of dog bred for sled dog racing. The eurohound is crossbred from the Alaskan husky and any of a number of pointing breeds (&quot;pointers&quot;), but most often the German Shorthair Pointer.

== History ==

After World War II, skijor and pulka style dog sled racing gained rapidly in popularity in Norway and neighboring Scandinavian countries. These styles of racing required small, fast teams of 1-4 dogs who competed over short, hilly distances of . Required to use purebred dogs by the Norwegian Sled Dog Racing Association, the German Shorthair Pointer quickly emerged as the dog breed of choice. At the beginning of the 1970s, the &quot;sled pointer&quot; had emerged, a pointing dog who was bred for sledding and not hunting.

In the 1970s, &quot;Nome-style&quot; sled racing, which mimicked the bigger teams running long distances and overnighting in subzero temperatures seen in North American-style races, started to attract interest in Scandinavia. In 1974, the first Nome-style sled race, the Skjelbreia Sweepstakes, was hosted near Oslo. For this style of racing, Norwegian mushers began to import Alaskan huskies; popularized by mushers like Stein Havard Fjelstad and Roger Leegaard who traveled to Alaska to race in the Iditarod. However, as a performance crossbreed, the Alaskan husky could not be raced in Norway until 1985, when the Norwegian Sled Dog Racing Association removed the requirement that sled dogs be purebred. 

This new ruling paved the way for Nordic-style mushers to breed their best performing dogs regardless of breed, with mushers mixing Alaskan huskies, sled pointers and even greyhounds for Nordic-style racing, while Nome-style mushers began to mix Greenland dogs with Alaskan huskies to produce a dog better suited to Scandinavia&#x27;s heavy snowfall. The Nordic-style dogs gained in popularity across Europe and later North America, especially with the rise in popularity of dryland mushing, such as bikejoring and canicross.

The term &quot;eurohound&quot; was coined by Ivana Nolke, to distinguish the European racing dogs being imported into Alaska.

== Description ==

Rather than inbreeding similar-looking dogs in order to create a new breed with a consistent appearance, eurohounds are bred for the specific working traits and health needed to run short, high intensity sprint races. The foundational dogs most often used for eurohounds are German Shorthaired Pointers (and English Pointers), other pointers, and Alaskan huskies from tightly bred sprint dog lines used for racing. Alaskan huskies are chosen for their ability to pull for extreme distances and in subzero temperatures while pointers are vigorous and energetic sprint racers. Greyhound and saluki may also be crossed with sled pointers; however; these dogs are known as Greysters. Greysters are popular for dryland racing, and limited-class snow racing.

A first-generation eurohound cross (fifty percent pointing breed, fifty percent husky) have short coats, suitable for sprint races, which doesn&#x27;t involve resting or sleeping on the trail. Often sprint racing eurohounds are housed indoors or in heated barns in subzero temperatures, whereas their Alaskan husky counterparts would be immune to the cold. When the first-generation cross is crossed again with the Alaskan husky, the resulting generation can have thicker coats, suitable for longer-distance teams. Most distance mushers prefer the pointer genetics to only be 1/8 in a dog for maximum performance. This then reduces the eurohound influence, and dogs should be termed Alaskan Husky crosses or mixed hounds. The eurohound is sleeker than a husky and can hit speeds of 25 miles per hour. 

Fairly common features of fifty percent crosses are half-dropped ears, black with white blazing as shown in the photo, or solid with patches of spots. Some completely spotted dogs appear as well. These dogs have a similar coat to German Shorthair Pointer and looks like standard hunting dogs. Once the percentage of pointer drops, the dogs start to look more like Alaskan huskies.

<text>Houston Field House is a multi-purpose arena located on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York. 
It is the nation&#x27;s third-oldest college hockey rink, behind Northeastern University&#x27;s Matthews Arena and Princeton University&#x27;s Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. Further, it is the second-oldest arena in the ECAC Hockey League, behind Princeton&#x27;s rink. Until the opening of MVP Arena in Albany in 1990, it was the largest arena in the Capital Region.

==Origins==
Popular legend holds that Houston Field House was previously an airplane or dirigible hangar for the United States armed forces during World War II. In reality, it originated as a warehouse for the United States Navy in Davisville, Rhode Island.

Following the war, the federal government established the Veterans Education Facilities Program (VEFP) to help colleges build facilities to handle the increased enrollment of veterans returning from the war. One aspect of the VEFP was to offer buildings designated as &quot;war surplus&quot; to colleges and academic institutions who applied for them.

Originally, the RPI Board of Trustees, led by then-RPI President Dr. Livingston W. Houston, sought a hangar from the VEFP in order to establish a &quot;sports-civic arena&quot; for the RPI campus and the city of Troy. Unfortunately, hangars were not considered &quot;war surplus.&quot; An investigation sponsored by the Board of Trustees discovered the warehouse facility in Rhode Island and applied under the VEFP to bring it to campus, despite the fact that its original design was not satisfactory for the creation of an arena.

The VEFP underwrote both the cost of transporting the warehouse from Davisville to Troy and the cost to reassemble it upon its arrival. RPI, however, spent nearly $500,000 on its own to redesign the warehouse to its own specifications, including the re-fabrication of initial materials and the purchase of new materials.

Construction was originally planned to be completed by June 1948; however, inclement weather throughout the project pushed completion back 16 months to October 1949. On October 13, Houston officially opened the building as the RPI Field House as part of a ceremony honoring the Institute&#x27;s 125th anniversary.

==Early history==
A month later, on November 12, 1949, the RPI Field House hosted its first event, an Interfraternity Ball, with music performed by Elliot Lawrence and his Orchestra. On December 3, 1949, the first sporting event in the Field House&#x27;s history took place as RPI defeated the New York State Maritime Academy, 55–43, in basketball.

A large impetus for the construction of the Field House was to create a home for the school&#x27;s ice hockey team, which had played its first games in 1901 at Van Schaick Pond in nearby Cohoes, New York, and later played in various other locations in Cohoes and Albany, New York. From 1912 to 1938 (with the exception of 1937), the team played on an outdoor rink built every winter on campus along Sage Avenue, at the current location of Anderson Field. After the 1938 season, the team went into hiatus. Houston, an RPI alumnus who played hockey for RPI during his school years, originally sought to build the Field House as a means of returning hockey to campus. On January 10, 1950, the &quot;Engineers&quot; under head coach Ned Harkness played their first game at home since 1938, dropping an 8–2 contest to Middlebury. However, and possibly thanks to the construction of the Field House, Harkness would lead the Engineers to an NCAA championship only four years later in 1954.

Two weeks after the first hockey game, the RPI Field House hosted its first commencement ceremony, on January 27, 1950. General Omar Bradley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave the first commencement address.

On December 27, 1951, the Field House hosted the first annual RPI Invitational Tournament. The first tournament featured 8 schools playing 12 games over three days, and was won by Brown University. The following year, the tournament was cut to 4 teams playing a round-robin schedule over 3 days, which remained the tournament&#x27;s format until 1982, when it gained a 2nd-day consolation game/championship game format. The RPI Invitational was the nation&#x27;s oldest in-season invitational tournament in college hockey until its final iteration in 2010.

Throughout the 1950s, several RPI sporting events were held at the RPI Field House, including basketball, tennis, wrestling, and pistol and rifle shooting.

In March 1959, the Field House hosted the NCAA tournament known today as the Frozen Four. North Dakota won its first of several NCAA championships, defeating Michigan State, Boston College, and St. Lawrence. Three of the tournament&#x27;s four games went into overtime.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the RPI Field House was often referred to as &quot;The Madison Square Garden of Upstate New York&quot;. In its first two decades, it played host to more than 300 theatrical and musical events, countless hockey games, and several commencement ceremonies.

==Hockey line==
As the popularity of hockey grew, tickets became hot items among students. Owing to its origins as a military warehouse, most views were obstructed at least some angle between the rink and the seats due to large support columns that held up the Field House&#x27;s roof. This led to the birth of what is known simply as &quot;hockey line.&quot; Groups of people – usually members of various fraternities and sororities – take a place outside of the RPI Student Union building. Traditionally, the line began sometime during late July or early August prior to the beginning of Fall classes and continued until tickets went on sale in mid-September. People in line are allowed to buy up to eight tickets and can have people hold their place in line while they eat or go to class. Students set up beds, couches, television sets, and, more recently, computers and video games to pass the time as someone occupies each place in line on a 24-hour basis.

Following the Engineers&#x27; 1985 national championship victory, the Epsilon Iota chapter of the Psi Upsilon fraternity set a hockey line record by beginning the line on the very next day – March 31, 1985 – and continuing the line through the summer until tickets went on sale on September 25, 1985 — besting the previous record of 33 days with 178 days.

==Renovation and rejuvenation==
In 1978, a new tradition started that continues today – the annual Big Red Freakout! event. This event fills the Field House with thousands of screaming fans, and there is a giveaway each year.

At the 1978 Commencement ceremonies, it was announced that the RPI Field House would be renamed Houston Field House in honor of former president Livingston W. Houston, who had died the previous winter. Houston had been RPI&#x27;s 11th president from 1943 to 1958, and was president when the Field House was built.

1983 brought several changes to the Field House. The Institute spent $2.5 million to renovate the building during the summer, including a support renovation which allowed the removal of all but four of the columns. Some think the view obstruction caused by the original columns gave rise to &quot;hockey line&quot; and that column removal led to the demise of &quot;hockey line&quot;, but popularity of hockey was at least as large a factor. Indeed, &quot;hockey line&quot; reached its peak several years after the 1983 renovations. New scoreboards were installed, and the ice surface was lengthened to a full NHL size. In 1984, the NCAA tournament returned to Houston Field House for the first time since 1959 as the Engineers took on North Dakota. The Fighting Sioux, coming in as heavy underdogs, upset the homestanding Engineers on consecutive nights, ending the Engineers national title hopes. The next season, the Field House would host its final two NCAA tournament games as RPI dispatched Lake Superior State on their way to their second NCAA championship. Today&#x27;s NCAA tournament games all take place at neutral ice sites with a minimum capacity higher than that of the Field House.

During the mid-1980s, Houston Field House was part of a vibrant boxing scene in the Capital District. Mike Tyson fought twice at the venue in 1986, but Tyson&#x27;s rise to the heavyweight championship at the end of the year helped lead to a decline, and boxing has not been featured at Houston Field House in recent years.

The 1987 Big Red Freakout! event featured plastic horns as the giveaway. These horns made Houston Field House reverberate with noise – so much noise, in fact, that the evening&#x27;s opponent, Brown, filed a complaint with the NCAA. In turn, this led to the creation of what is today known as &quot;the RPI rule&quot; nationwide, which prohibits fans from bringing artificial noisemakers into NCAA events.

In 1990, the New York Islanders of the NHL moved their primary minor-league team to Houston Field House, naming them the Capital District Islanders. &quot;CDI&quot; played in the American Hockey League from 1990 to 1993. In 1993, the Capital District Islanders were sold to Albert Lawerence and moved across the river the play at the Knick/Pepsi/Times Union Center as the Albany River Rats. The team affiliated with the New Jersey Devils.

The RPI women&#x27;s hockey team, a club team beginning in 1976, hosted the AWCHA national women&#x27;s club championship at Houston Field House in 1994, winning the national championship, and in 1995, when they finished in 3rd. The team became a varsity program later that year, and joined their male counterparts in NCAA&#x27;s Division I in 2005.

During the 1998–1999 hockey season, a new four-sided scoreboard was added to the center of the Field House, replacing the scoreboards on the eastern and western walls.

==Today==
Today, the Houston Field House seats 4,780 for hockey games, and remains the largest capacity in the ECAC Hockey League despite a decrease from its capacity of 5,217 in 2008. Its modern function is primarily as a home for the RPI men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams to compete and practice, though several skating clubs also call the Field House home.

Before the opening of the Times Union Center in Albany, the Houston Field House was the Capital District&#x27;s main venue for concerts. Recent guests have included The Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marilyn Manson, Sting, Bob Dylan, John Mayer, moe., Counting Crows, Matchbox Twenty, Guster &amp; O.A.R., among others.

Since the Field House&#x27;s opening, the Institute has opened several other venues for athletic teams to play in, and today is used only by the hockey teams among the 21 other varsity sports offered at RPI. This decrease in activity allowed the Institute&#x27;s intramural hockey program to utilize the Field House. Also, with the increase in enrollment, the Field House now no longer serves as the primary location for Commencement ceremonies. Today, the ceremonies are held at next-door East Campus Stadium. Houston Field House is considered the emergency venue, last holding ceremonies on May 25, 2013 when low temperatures and rain forced the ceremony indoors. Ironically, what may have initially prompted moving commencement out of the Field House was its lack of air conditioning, as the May, 1989 commencement was shortened because of the near-90° heat and stifling temperatures inside the arena.

Today&#x27;s &quot;hockey line&quot; is a shadow of what it was during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s. With the number of obstructed view seats now at a minimum, it is no longer necessary to stay on line for weeks to ensure good seats, and the men&#x27;s hockey team is currently not as successful as it once was. When the Student Union itself was renovated in the late 1990s, the hockey line all but died completely. Today, the Delta Phi fraternity tends to start the line every year in early September, and most other fraternities and many dormatories join the line a day or two before tickets go on sale. When it was a more major local concert venue in the 1970s and 1980s, one would frequently see lines for those tickets as well. In a usual occurrence in 1985, tickets for a joint Night Ranger/Jefferson Starship concert were to go on sale the morning after a Howard Jones concert commenced, so many people attending the concert went on line right after to wait for the ticket booth to open. As Howard Jones left his concert, he noticed the fans waiting outside in the 35° cold and asked what was going on. To show support he offered to sign autographs for everyone on the line.

Notable features in the Field House today include the Rensselaer Alumni Association display at the entrance to the arena, which features RPI hockey players who have been named All-Americans and those who have played in the NHL. On the eastern side of the Field House is a stage, upon which &quot;America&#x27;s Pep Band&quot; plays during hockey games. On the western wall of the Field House, centered by the seal of the Institute, are six banners honoring the men&#x27;s team&#x27;s NCAA championships in 1954 and 1985, their ECAC championships in 1984, 1985 and 1995 and a banner honoring the women&#x27;s club team&#x27;s AWCHA national championship of 1994.

On November 5, 2004, RPI began its &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; at Houston Field House by unveiling a banner honoring Adam Oates and his number 12. Oates&#x27; banner was joined on November 12, 2005 by one recognizing number 9, Joé Juneau. Legendary coach Ned Harkness and 1954 standout Frank Chiarelli have since been added to the Ring as well.

As part of a major campus improvement project to build the East Campus Athletic Village, the Houston Field House underwent several renovations starting in 2007. These included the renovations of the locker rooms, addition of a new weight room, and a new special reception room dedicated to Ned Harkness. Additionally, as part of the renovations, solar panels were added installed on the roof to supply power to the building through a government grant.

The indie pop duo Matt &amp; Kim recorded a Harlem Shake video during a concert at the Houston Field House on February 11, 2013.

<text>Eskdale is a civil parish in the western Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. It is named after the &quot;Eskdale&quot; valley which the River Esk flows through on its way from the fells of the Lake District to the Irish Sea at Ravenglass. The civil parish is not coterminous with the valley, as the parish also includes the upper valley of the River Mite (&quot;Miterdale&quot;), whilst the lower reaches of the River Esk are in the civil parish of Muncaster.

In 2001 the parish had a population of 264, increasing to 304 at the 2011 Census. Most of the population is concentrated in the two villages of Eskdale Green and Boot that are within the parish. 

One of the Lake District&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, runs through the parish, though along with other western parts of the Lake District, Eskdale is notably quieter during the high summer season than the more accessible eastern areas.

==Governance==
Eskdale has a parish council, and is also within the unitary authority of Cumberland. Both the parish and unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government. The parish is also in the ceremonial county of Cumbria, but since 2023 this has had no administrative role. 

At a national level, the parish is within the Barrow and Furness UK parliamentary constituency.

==History==
The area became one of the locations involved in the Cumbria shootings perpetrated by 52-year-old taxi driver Derrick Bird, who shot and killed twelve people and wounded eleven others. Several of the wounded victims were shot in Eskdale and the surrounding area.

==Literature==
In a note to her poetical illustration (Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836) to a painting by G. Pickering, Letitia Elizabeth Landon remarks on the hospitality of the &#x27;estatesmen&#x27; of this district.

Eskdale and Rafnglass (modern Ravenglass) feature in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s final novel Sword Song, set in the 9th century and published posthumously in 1997.

<text>The Alberta Legislature is the unicameral legislature of the province of Alberta, Canada. The legislature is made of two elements: the lieutenant governor (representing the King of Canada), and the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The legislature has existed since Alberta was formed out of part of the North-West Territories in 1905.

Like the Canadian federal government, Alberta uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are sent to the Legislative Assembly after general elections and the lieutenant governor appoints the person who can command a majority of the members of the Assembly, typically the leader of the party with the most seats, as Premier of Alberta. The premier then recommends the appointment of the Executive Council of Alberta. The premier is Alberta&#x27;s head of government, while the King of Canada is its head of state.

<doc id="1345660" wikidata="Q1538801" url="?curid=1345660" title="Stanley Park, Liverpool">
<text>Stanley Park is a park in Liverpool, England, designed by Edward Kemp, which was opened on 14 May 1870 by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joseph Hubback. It is significant among Liverpool&#x27;s parks on account of its layout and architecture. It has a grand terrace with expansive bedding schemes that were once highlighted by fountains. It includes the 1899 Gladstone Conservatory (recently restored and renamed the Isla Gladstone Conservatory), a Grade II listed building built by Mackenzie &amp; Moncur of Edinburgh. 50–60% of the land consisted of open turfed areas, suitable for sport, with most of the rest being laid out as formal gardens and lakes. Kemp designed a horse-riding track (&#x27;Rotten Row&#x27;), though it did not catch on and was restyled as a cycle track around 1907.

Stanley Park is known for dividing the home grounds of rival Merseyside football clubs Everton and Liverpool. However it was also the original home to a fledgling Everton Football Club in 1879 before the club moved to nearby Priory Road and then Anfield Road.

Part of Stanley Park was to have been incorporated into the area of Liverpool&#x27;s proposed new stadium, plans for which were first announced in 2000, ironically the same location Everton F.C. played, but a change of ownership of the club during autumn 2010 resulted in the Stanley Park project being scrapped in October 2012, in favour of expanding Anfield.

The park has an Evangelical church located on the corner in between the two football teams. It is named &quot;Stanley Park Church&quot; and is over 100 years old.

The park is named after Lord Stanley of Preston.

==Stanley Park in literature and film==
Stanley Park featured in Alexei Sayle&#x27;s short story &quot;The Last Woman Killed in the War&quot;. As a film location it partly played a backdrop in Sayle&#x27;s 1980s BBC documentary for the series &quot;Comic Roots&quot;. It featured in the 2003 film &quot;Dad&#x27;s Dead&quot;.

<text>Garlic chutney, also referred to as lahsun chutney, lahsun ki chutney, lehsun chutney and bellulli chutney, is a chutney, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from fresh garlic, dry or fresh coconut, groundnuts and green or red chili peppers. Cumin and tamarind are also sometimes used as ingredients. It is prepared in both wet and dried forms. The wet variety is made with fresh grated coconut and is typically served immediately after preparation.

==Dry variety==
The dry variety is a commercial product purveyed in packets and jars. Homemade dried garlic chutney can be stored in bottles and will last up to four weeks. When refrigerated, it can be kept for up to six months. It is eaten either dry or mixed with yogurt, curd, buttermilk or vegetable oil. It is sometimes prepared in a powdered form.

==Uses==
Garlic chutney is used for cooking in many Indian (especially Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan and northern Karnataka) and Pakistani homes. It is often eaten with fresh, hot bhakri (a flat, unleavened roti made from flour of grains such as jowar (sorghum), bajra (pearl millet), nachni (finger millet), etc.). Garlic chutney is sometimes served as an accompaniment to chaats and khandvi.

<doc id="1345679" wikidata="Q2546341" url="?curid=1345679" title="Wrynose Pass">
<text>The Wrynose Pass is a mountain pass in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England between the Duddon Valley and Little Langdale.
==Etymology==

The unusual name of the pass is taken from that of the adjacent Wrynose hill, also called Wrynose Fell. The name was recorded in 12th-century documents as &quot;Wrenhalse&quot; and in the 16th century as &quot;Wrenosse Hill&quot;. It is thought, based on a suggestion by Eilert Ekwall, to mean &quot;stallion&#x27;s ridge&quot;, being formed on the Old Norse words &quot;(v)reini&quot; (&quot;stallion&quot;, probably here used as a for an individual), and &quot;hala&quot;. It is one of a number of place names of Scandinavian origin in the area. 
Although most academic sources characterise &quot;Vreini&quot; in this context as a personal name, it has also been explained as suggesting &quot;the horse power needed to climb it&quot;. Other suggested origins are from Old Norse &quot;ravn hals&quot;, &quot;pass of the raven&quot;, and &quot;wreye nes&quot;, the &quot;twisted headland&quot;. Over the years, the name has been altered to the form &quot;Wrynose&quot; through folk etymology, though it is still locally pronounced &quot;Wreynuss&quot;, much like its older form.

==Road==

There is a single-track motor road over the pass with gradients up to 1 in 4. The pass reaches an altitude of 393m or 1,281 feet. The road drops to Wrynose Bottom, where there is a choice of heading south to Broughton-in-Furness or continuing west to Eskdale over Hardknott Pass, whose 1 in 3 gradient (about 33%) is one of the steepest roads in England. The modern road overlays a Roman road for some of the route, with the Roman track visible alongside in other stretches.

The pass separates the Furness Fells from the Bowfell-Crinkle Crags massif.

==Shire Stones==
At the top of the Wrynose Pass is the Three Shire Stone, marking the meeting point of the historic counties of Cumberland, Lancashire and Westmorland. Prior to the early 19th century, three &quot;county stones&quot; existed in the same spot.

==Farm==
At the bottom of Wrynose is Fell Foot Farm, a 17th-century, Grade II listed, National Trust property.

<doc id="1345683" wikidata="Q696045" url="?curid=1345683" title="Treuhandanstalt">
<text>The &#x27; (, &quot;Trust agency&quot;), colloquially referred to as &#x27;, was an agency established by the government of the German Democratic Republic to reprivatise/privatise East German enterprises, Volkseigene Betriebe (VEBs), prior to German reunification. Created by the Volkskammer on 17 June 1990, it oversaw the restructure and sale of about 8,500 state-owned companies with over four million employees. At that time, it was the world&#x27;s largest industrial enterprise, controlling everything from steel works to the Babelsberg Studios.

==Responsibilities==
The Treuhand was responsible for more than just the 8,500 state-owned enterprises. It also took over around 2.4 million hectares of agricultural land and forests, the property of the former Stasi, large parts of the property of the former National People&#x27;s Army, large-scale public housing property, and the property of the state pharmacy network.

On the day of reunification, 3 October 1990, it took over the property of the political parties and the mass organisations of the German Democratic Republic.

==Opposition==

Its operations drew criticism for unnecessarily closing allegedly profitable businesses, misuse and waste of funds and layoffs that were claimed to be unnecessary. It also drew substantial protest from the workforces affected, as 2.5 million employees in state-owned enterprises (out of 4 million in total) were laid off in the early 1990s. Supporters argued that not placing the former state-owned enterprises into private hands would have caused the loss of many more jobs and slowed economic recovery.

On 1 April 1991, chairman of the Treuhand Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was shot dead by an unknown assassin (possibly the Red Army Faction).
He was succeeded by Birgit Breuel.

When its operations ended in 1994, it had amassed 260 to 270 billion DM in debt.

==Successors==

Although the Treuhand ceased operations in 1994, it still retained much property and some other legal responsibilities. These were transferred to three successor agencies: 
* the &quot;Bundesanstalt für vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben&quot;, BvS (Federal Agency for Unification-related Special Tasks), which managed remaining state-owned enterprises;
* the &quot;Treuhandliegenschaftsgesellschaft&quot; (now TLG Immobilien GmbH), which manages the remaining state-owned urban and industrial real estate;
* the &quot;Bodenverwertungs- und -verwaltungs GmbH&quot; (BVVG), a subsidiary of the Treuhand created in 1992, which manages the state-owned agricultural land, forest lands, and related real estate.

The BvS ceased operations at the end of 2000, but it remains legally in existence; its remaining tasks are all delegated to other bodies. TLG and BVVG remain the largest real estate owners in the new federal states. In 2000, TLG was reoriented from focussing on privatisation of its assets to &quot;active portfolio management&quot; with a view to making profits for the German federal government. By 2007, having sold 45,000 properties in six years and reinvested 1.5 billion euros, it was still managing 1500 properties worth 1.4 billion euros. The planned privatisation of TLG itself was put on hold in July 2008 because of adverse economic conditions. In January 2020, TLG Immobilien was acquired by the Luxembourg-domiciled property company Aroundtown SA.

In July 2008, the BVVG announced total privatization receipts of 3.5 billion euros since its establishment in 1992, which it had gained through the sale of around of agricultural land, with a similar amount of forest land and a small amount of other land. Total land sales amounted to around half the area of the state of Saxony-Anhalt. At the end of 2007, it still owned over of agricultural land and just under of forest land.

<doc id="1345686" wikidata="Q17051800" url="?curid=1345686" title="Post-money valuation">
<text>Post-money valuation is a way of expressing the value of a company after an investment has been made. This value is equal to the sum of the pre-money valuation and the amount of new equity.

These valuations are used to express how much ownership external investors, such as venture capitalists and angel investors, receive when they make a cash injection into a company. The amount external investors invest into a company is equal to the company&#x27;s post-money valuation multiplied by the fraction of the company those investors own after the investment. Equivalently, the implied post-money valuation is calculated as the dollar amount of investment divided by the equity stake gained in an investment.

More specifically, the post-money valuation of a financial investment deal is given by the formula formula_1, where &quot;PMV&quot; is the post-money valuation, &quot;N&quot; is the number of shares the company has after the investment, and &quot;P&quot; is the price per share at which the investment was made. This formula is similar to the market capitalization formula used to express the value of public companies.

==Example 1==
If a company is worth $100 million (pre-money) and an investor makes an investment of $25 million, the new, post-money valuation of the company will be $125 million. The investor will now own 20% of the company. 

This basic example illustrates the general concept. However, in actual, real-life scenarios, the calculation of post-money valuation can be more complicated—because the capital structure of companies often includes convertible loans, warrants, and option-based management incentive schemes.

Strictly speaking, the calculation is the price paid per share multiplied by the total number of shares existing after the investment—i.e., it takes into account the number of shares arising from the conversion of loans, exercise of in-the-money warrants, and any in-the-money options. Thus it is important to confirm that the number is a fully diluted and fully converted post-money valuation.

In this scenario, the pre-money valuation should be calculated as the post-money valuation minus the total money coming into the company—not only from the purchase of shares, but also from the conversion of loans, the nominal interest, and the money paid to exercise in-the-money options and warrants.

==Example 2==
Consider a company with 1,000,000 shares, a convertible loan note for $1,000,000 converting at 75% of the next round price, warrants for 200,000 shares at $10 a share, and a granted employee stock ownership plan of 200,000 shares at $4 per share. The company receives an offer to invest $8,000,000 at $8 per share. 

The post-money valuation is equal to $8 times the number of shares existing after the transaction—in this case, 2,366,667 shares. This figure includes the original 1,000,000 shares, plus 1,000,000 shares from new investment, plus 166,667 shares from the loan conversion ($1,000,000 divided by 75% of the next investment round price of $8, or $1,000,000 / (.75 * 8) ), plus 200,000 shares from in-the-money options. The fully converted, fully diluted post-money valuation in this example is $18,933,336.

The pre-money valuation would be $9,133,336—calculated by taking the post-money valuation of $18,933,336 and subtracting the $8,000,000 of new investment, as well as $1,000,000 for the loan conversion and $800,000 from the exercise of the rights under the ESOP. Note that the warrants cannot be exercised because they are not in-the-money (i.e. their price, $10 a share, is still higher than the new investment price of $8 a share).

==Versus market value==
Importantly, a company&#x27;s post-money valuation is not equal to its market value. The post-money valuation formula does not take into account the special features of preferred stock. It assumes that preferred stock has the same value as common stock, which is usually not true as preferred stock often has liquidation preference, participation, and other features that make it worth more than common stock. Because preferred stock are worth more than common stock, post-money valuations tend to overstate the value of companies. Will Gornall and Ilya Strebulaev provide the fair values of the 135 of the largest U.S. venture capital-backed companies and argue that these companies&#x27; post-money valuations are an average of 50% above their market values.

==Up round, down round, and flat round==
Equity rounds can be classified into three distinct types to determine whether a round has been a success for the stakeholders of a company. These distinct types are an up round, down round, and flat round. However, there is not an industry consensus on the precise definition of these terms and this is an area of continued debate among industry participants, including investors, companies, and attorneys. The debate centers on whether company valuation or price per share should be used to classify the round. If company valuation is used, then the pre-money valuation of the current round would be compared to the post-money valuation of the prior round. 

According to The Wall Street Journal, share price should be used to classify the round. Consistent with that assessment, in a survey of attorneys based in Silicon Valley, eight out of ten said that share price should be used to classify the round. That said, two other lawyers in the same survey claimed that valuation and share price should both be used together to classify the round. In contrast, some investors and companies have argued that valuation alone, and not share price, should be used to classify the round. For example, an up round would occur when the pre-money valuation of the current round is more than the prior round&#x27;s post-money valuation.

Companies that are successfully growing will often raise equity in a series of subsequent up rounds from institutional investors. For example, institutional investors including venture capital firms, growth equity firms, private equity firms, corporate investors, and hedge funds may participate in these up rounds. These institutional investors may also participate in down rounds and flat rounds. Ultimately, these successfully growing companies may attain a successful exit, such as an IPO, direct listing, merger, or acquisition.

<text>Hard Knott is a fell in the English Lake District, at the head of Eskdale. 

The northern and western slopes of Hard Knott are in the civil parish of Eskdale, while the southern and eastern slopes are in the civil parish of Ulpha. Both are in the unitary authority area of Cumberland and the ceremonial county of Cumbria.

==Geology==
Rhyolitic lava-like tuff of the Bad Step Tuff forms the summit rocks with the dacitic lapilli-tuffs of the Lincomb Tarns Formation to the north west. Border end shows outcropping plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation.

==Summit==
Hard Knott reaches a height of , the summit knoll bearing a cairn. There are other named tops on the ridge in addition to the summit, with Yew Bank to the north and Border End to the south. Hard Knott is famous for its superb view of the Scafell massif to the north, while Harter Fell dominates the vista to the south. For a fabulous view of Eskdale it is recommended that the walker visits Border End half a mile to the south of the main summit.

==Ascents==
The fell is usually climbed from the top of the Hardknott Pass where there are several parking spaces. It is also possible to begin the ascent from the foot of the pass in Eskdale, although this will triple the length of the walk and the height gained. However, the best plan is probably to climb Hard Knott in conjunction with the neighbouring fell of Harter Fell making a horseshoe walk starting and finishing in Eskdale. From the top of the pass it is a short ascent to the fell summit following an electric fence that skirts to the right of the dangerous looking Raven Crag and takes the walker to the summit in a short time. Other possible routes include a pathless ascent from the Esk via The Steeple, a circuitous walk via the head of Moasdale and an ascent of the eastern flanks via Dod Pike.

<doc id="1345714" wikidata="Q2318986" url="?curid=1345714" title="The Collector's Series, Volume One">
<text>The Collector&#x27;s Series, Volume One is a primarily English-language compilation album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music on 23 October 2000. The album was renamed Tout en amour (meaning &quot;All in Love&quot;) in France. It features &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot;, the song that Dion performed during the opening ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics. The album has sold over three million copies worldwide.

==Content==
&quot;The Collector&#x27;s Series, Volume One&quot; is a compilation of some of Dion&#x27;s biggest hits and few rare tracks. The album features &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot; from the opening ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics, duets with Barbra Streisand and Andrea Bocelli, and few rarely heard non-English language songs. It also includes singles which were not issued on Dion&#x27;s previous greatest hits album &quot;All the Way… A Decade of Song&quot;: &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot;, &quot;Only One Road&quot;, &quot;Falling into You&quot;, &quot;Tell Him&quot;, and &quot;The Reason&quot;.

&quot;Tout en amour&quot; was released in France also as a limited edition, including twelve colour postcards with previously unreleased photos of Dion. The album was re-released in October 2004 in few European countries, as part of the &quot;Best of the Best Gold&quot; series. The gold-disc pressing was housed in a die-cut slipcase, exposing the gold disc and featured the same tracks that graced the standard pressing.

==Critical reception==
According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Series, Volume One&quot; filled the gaps left by Dion&#x27;s hits collection, &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; - the many duets, French and Spanish songs, and previously unheard in the US tracks. He wondered why it couldn&#x27;t be nothing but rarities, which would have served them better than this &quot;mixed bag&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Collector&#x27;s Series, Volume One&quot; has sold over three million copies worldwide and topped chart in France, and reached top ten in Canada and Portugal.

In the United States, the album debuted at No. 28 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 36,000 copies in its first week. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold 914,000 copies in the US.

<doc id="1345734" wikidata="Q8048660" url="?curid=1345734" title="Yangtze Patrol">
<text>The Yangtze Patrol, also known as the Yangtze River Patrol Force, Yangtze River Patrol, YangPat, and ComYangPat, was a prolonged naval operation initiated after the Battle of Muddy Flat, from 1854 to 1949 to protect American interests in the Yangtze River&#x27;s treaty ports. The Yangtze Patrol also patrolled the coastal waters of China where they protected U.S. citizens, their property, and Christian missionaries.

The Yangtze River is the longest river in China, and it plays an important commercial role, with ocean-bound vessels proceeding as far upstream as the city of Wuhan. This squadron-sized unit cruised the waters of the Yangtze from Shanghai on the Pacific Ocean into the far interior of China at Chongqing.

Initially, the Yangtze Patrol was formed from ships of the United States Navy and assigned to the East India Squadron. In 1868, patrol duties were carried out by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. Under the unequal treaties, the United States, Japan, and various European powers, especially the United Kingdom, which had been on the Yangtze since 1897, were allowed to cruise China&#x27;s rivers.

In 1902, the United States Asiatic Fleet took control of the operations of the Yangtze Patrol.

In 1922, Yangtze Patrol was established as a formal component of the United States Navy in China.

In 1942, when the United States entered World War II, the Yangtze Patrol effectively ceased operations in China because of the limited resources of the United States Navy, which needed the patrol crews and their ships elsewhere in fighting with Japanese forces throughout the Pacific.

Following the end of World War II, the Yangtze Patrol resumed its duties in 1945, but on a more limited basis with fewer ships during the Chinese Civil War. When the Chinese Communist forces eventually occupied the Yangtze River valley in 1949, the United States Navy permanently ceased operations and disbanded the Yangtze Patrol.

==Operations (1854–1949)==



===19th century===

====1854–1860====
As a result of treaties imposed on China by foreign powers after the First (18391842) and Second Opium Wars (18561860), China was opened to foreign trade at a number of locations known as &quot;treaty ports&quot; where foreigners were permitted to live and conduct business. Also, created by the treaties was the doctrine of extraterritoriality, a system whereby citizens of foreign countries living in China were subject to the laws of their home country. Most favoured nation treatment under the treaties assured other countries of the fact that the same privileges would be afforded to them as well, and soon many nations, including the United States, operated merchant ships and navy gunboats on the waterways of China.

====1860–1900====
During the 1860s and 1870s, American merchant ships were prominent on the lower Yangtze River, operating up to the deepwater port of Hankow inland. The added mission of anti-piracy patrols required U.S. naval and marine landing parties be put ashore several times to protect American interests. In 1874, the U.S. gunboat, , reached as far as Ichang, at the foot of the Yangtze gorges, from the sea. During this period, most US personnel found a tour in the Yangtze to be uneventful, as a major American shipping company had sold its interests to a Chinese firm, leaving the patrol with little to protect. However, as the stability of China began to deteriorate after 1890, the U.S. naval presence began to increase along the Yangtze.



===20th century===

====1900–1920====
In 1901, American-flagged merchant vessels returned to the Yangtze when Standard Oil Company placed a steam-powered tanker in service on the lower river. Within the decade, several small motorships began hauling kerosene, the principal petroleum product used in China for that company. At the same time, the United States Navy acquired four Spanish vessels (the gunboats , , , and ), which it had seized in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. These vessels became the core of the Yangtze River patrol for the first dozen years of the 20th century, but they lacked the power to go beyond Yichang onto the more difficult stretches of the river.

 and were the first American gunboats built specifically for service on the Yangtze River. The Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California built them in 1913. The U.S. Navy then had them disassembled and shipped to China aboard the American steamer &quot;Mongolia&quot;. The Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai reassembled them and put them into service in 1914.

Later in 1914, both vessels demonstrated their ability to handle the rapids of the upper river when they reached Chongqing, which was more than from the sea, and then went further to Jiading on the Min River. In 1917, the U.S. entered World War I. The U.S. rendered the guns of &quot;Palos&quot; and &quot;Monocacy&quot; inoperable to protect Chinese neutrality. After China entered the war on the side of the Allies, the U.S. Navy reactivated the guns.

In 1917, the first Standard Oil tanker reached Chongqing, and a pattern of American commerce on the river began to emerge. On 17 January 1918, armed Chinese men attacked &quot;Monocacy&quot; and she was forced to return fire with her 6-pounder gun. Passenger and cargo service by American-flag ships began in 1920 with the Robert Dollar Line and the American West China Company. They were followed in 1923 by the Yangtze River Steamship Company, which stayed on the river until 1935, long after the other American passenger-cargo ships were gone.

====1920–1930====
In the early 1920s, the patrol found itself fighting the forces of warlords and bandits. To accommodate its increased responsibilities on the river, the United States Navy constructed six new gunboats in Shanghai during 1926–1927 and commissioned them in late 1927–1928 during the command of Rear Admiral Yates Stirling Jr. to replace four craft, originally seized from Spain during the Spanish–American War, that had been patrolling since 1903. All were capable of reaching Chongqing at high water, and all year-round. Collectively referred to by the U.S. press as &quot;the new six&quot;, and were the largest, and next in size, and and the smallest. These vessels gave the Navy the capability it needed at a time when operational requirements were growing rapidly.

In the late 1920s, Chiang Kai-shek and the Northern Expedition created a volatile military situation for the patrol along the Yangtze.

====1930–1942====
After the Japanese took control of much of the middle and lower Yangtze in the 1930s, American river gunboats entered into a period of inactivity and impotence. During the early-1930s, National Revolutionary Army took control of much of the north bank of the middle river. The climax of hostilities occurred in 1937 with the Rape of Nanking and the sinking of &quot;Panay&quot; by the Japanese. The USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident was the first loss of a U.S. Navy vessel in the conflict which would soon become World War II. Just prior to the Attack on Pearl Harbor, most of the ships on the Yangtze River Patrol were brought out of China, with only the smallest gunboats, &quot;Wake&quot; (the renamed &quot;Guam&quot;) and &quot;Tutuila&quot; remaining behind. &quot;Wake&quot;, at Shanghai, was subsequently captured by the Japanese. &quot;Tutuila&quot;, at Chongqing, was turned over to the Chinese. When the other gunboats reached Manila, the Yangtze River Patrol was formally dissolved when, on 5 December 1941, Rear Admiral Glassford sent the message, &quot;COMYANGPAT DISSOLVED&quot;. Subsequently, the evacuated ships were all scuttled or captured with their crews and imprisoned by the Japanese, after the fall of Corregidor in mid-1942. &quot;Luzon&quot; was later salvaged and used by the Japanese. was sunk in battle on 3 March 1942 and &quot;Mindanao&quot; was scuttled on 2 May; &quot;Oahu&quot; was sunk in battle 5 May 1942.

During different periods of time, Naval and Marine Corps personnel, who were in the patrol, were eligible for either the Yangtze Service Medal or the China Service Medal.

====1945–1949====
After the surrender of Japan, some patrols on the river were resumed in September 1945. A few days after Japan&#x27;s surrender, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, commander of the United States 7th Fleet, sailed south aboard to rendezvous with Task Force 73 and continue on to Shanghai. However, they were delayed due to a large typhoon and the river being swept for mines. They finally proceeded up the river and arrived in Shanghai on 19 September 1945, with the first Allied ships in over three years. The American flotilla included the command ship (USS &quot;Rocky Mount&quot;), two light cruisers, four destroyers, twelve destroyer escorts, and many PT boats and minesweepers along with a British naval contingent of three light cruisers, six destroyers, six destroyer escorts, and some minesweepers. In November the new heavy cruiser joined the unit.

When the Chinese Civil War finally reached the Yangtze Valley, in 1949, the U.S. Navy permanently ceased operations on the Yangtze River and officially disbanded the Yangtze Patrol.

==Popular culture==
* The fictional USS &quot;San Pablo&quot;, the Yangtze Patrol gunboat in Richard McKenna&#x27;s well-known 1962 novel &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, set in 1926, was modelled on the , a 31-year-old vessel originally captured from Spain during the Spanish–American War in 1898. In many respects, it resembled design features of the later 1928 gunboats. McKenna served aboard one of these newer river gunboats a decade after the time of his novel. The 1966 film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; was based on the novel.
* William Lederer, the author of the 1958 novel &quot;The Ugly American&quot;, served on the gunboat USS &quot;Tutuila&quot; around the same time as McKenna.
* Kemp Tolley, an officer who served as executive officer of the gunboat USS &quot;Tutuila&quot; in the 1930s, wrote &quot;Yangtze Patrol&quot;, a well-received history of the patrol.
* Actor Jack Warden was an enlisted sailor with the Yangtze Patrol in the late 1930s, before World War II.
* Fictional character Bobby Shaftoe served on the Yangtze Patrol in the Neal Stephenson book &#x27;Cryptonomicon&#x27;.

<text>WPHL-TV (channel 17) is a television station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, serving as the local outlet for The CW. The station also maintains a secondary affiliation with MyNetworkTV. Owned and operated by The CW&#x27;s majority owner, Nexstar Media Group, WPHL-TV has studios in the Wynnefield section of West Philadelphia and broadcasts itself and WUVP-DT (channel 65), the area&#x27;s Univision station, from a tower in the antenna farm at Roxborough.

The first incarnation of channel 17 was a low-profile religious station, WPCA-TV, which started broadcasting July 17, 1960. It was founded by Percy Crawford&#x27;s Young People&#x27;s Church of the Air. Crawford died months after starting the station, and it went off the air August 1, 1962. It was purchased by a group led by Aaron Katz and relaunched as WPHL-TV on September 12, 1965. WPHL-TV was one of three independent stations, all on the ultra high frequency (UHF) band, to start in Philadelphia that year, competing with channel 29 (now WTXF-TV) and the original channel 48 (WKBS-TV). The station was merged into the U.S. Communications group, owned by American Viscose Corporation, in 1967 alongside construction permits held by Daniel H. Overmyer; WPHL-TV was the most successful station in the group and the only one not threatened with closure. Channel 17 was a sports broadcaster from the start, airing Philadelphia 76ers basketball from 1965 to 1972 and Philadelphia Phillies baseball from 1971 to 1982.

The Providence Journal Company acquired WPHL-TV in 1978. During its ownership, channel 17 lost the Phillies after Taft Broadcasting, then-owner of channel 29, acquired the team, but it strengthened its competitive position by buying most of WKBS-TV&#x27;s programming inventory when it liquidated in 1983. A new Taft Broadcasting, formed after the Taft family sold the earlier company and its stations, acquired the station at the end of 1987, with most of channel 29&#x27;s executives defecting to channel 17. The station became more competitive, but the new Taft Broadcasting was burdened by debt from a leveraged buyout and sold WPHL-TV to Tribune Broadcasting in 1992. In Tribune&#x27;s first three years of ownership, channel 17 became the home of Phillies baseball once again; affiliated with The WB; and launched its first local newscast, a joint venture with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; known as &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot; that lasted two years. When the partnership was dissolved at the end of 1996, WPHL took newscast production in-house, but it struggled to find a substantial audience, with Tribune outsourcing news production to WCAU (channel 10) in 2005.

When The WB and UPN merged to form The CW in 2006, WPHL-TV was excluded from the new network and instead affiliated with MyNetworkTV. In 2012, the station switched news providers from WCAU to WPVI-TV (channel 6), and in 2015, it began producing an in-house morning newscast. Nexstar acquired Tribune in 2019 and, after purchasing The CW in 2022, moved its Philadelphia affiliation to WPHL-TV in 2023.

==Early history==
===WPCA-TV: Religious programming===
Radio station WKDN of Camden, New Jersey, received a construction permit for ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 17 as WKDN-TV on January 27, 1954. After not building the facility, the station sold the permit to the Young People&#x27;s Church of the Air, owned by Percy Crawford, for $40,000 in February 1959. The call letters were changed to WPCA-TV, reflecting both his initials and the name of his long-running broadcast ministry; the city of license was changed from Camden to Philadelphia in March 1960.

Promising a lineup of religious programs and family entertainment, the station signed on July 17, 1960, as the second local UHF station after educational WHYY-TV (channel 35). The station went silent August 1, 1962, having operated just two years. Crawford died October 31, 1960, after suffering a heart attack while driving. The station went silent August 1, 1962, having operated just two years.

===WPHL-TV: Independent station relaunch===
When channel 17 went silent, its sale was immediately announced to a consortium headed by attorney Aaron Jerome Katz and two real estate men. The station returned to the air on January 31, only to go dark again on June 14, when an application for the sale of channel 17 was finally filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The station&#x27;s cameras were lent to WHYY-TV, the new public television station in Wilmington, Delaware, to allow that station to operate before a scheduled donation of equipment could be transferred and the station&#x27;s own equipment did not function properly.

The Philadelphia Television Broadcasting Company, headed by Katz and advertising executive Len Stevens, was approved to purchase the station in mid-1964. After receiving approval to boost its effective radiated power from 12,000 to 626,000 watts, the new owners returned channel 17 to the air on September 17, 1965, as independent station WPHL-TV. Among its leading local programs were a weekly teen dance show, a children&#x27;s cartoon program and a jazz show hosted by Sid Mark. It also carried away games of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. The relaunched channel 17 was one of three new UHF stations to launch in the Philadelphia market in 1965. Channel 29 debuted as WIBF-TV on May 16, and channel 48 was activated as WKBS-TV on September 1. WPHL-TV increased its effective radiated power to 1 million watts in August 1966.

==U.S. Communications ownership==
In 1967, U.S. Communications Corporation, a division of the American Viscose Corporation (AVC), acquired WPHL-TV in exchange for 30 percent of the stock in a larger station group it was assembling. This group would include WPHL-TV and five construction permits for new major-market UHF stations held by Daniel H. Overmyer&#x27;s Overmyer Communications. The relationship between WPHL-TV and Overmyer had been developing since the start of 1966, when former Overmyer director Robert F. Adams left the company and started a consulting firm serving the Overmyer group and WPHL-TV; further, channel 17 had signed up for the proposed Overmyer Network, which operated in May 1967 under other ownership as the short-lived United Network with WPHL-TV as one of its affiliates. One partner in the investment firm facilitating the sale of the Overmyer construction permits had been a stockholder in channel 17. The FCC approved the sale on December 8, 1967, waiving a proposed rule in place since 1965 that sought to limit television station ownership within the top 50 markets, a practice the FCC had employed before in similar transactions. Katz and Stevens, the previous owners of WPHL-TV, became senior executives in the new U.S. Communications Corporation. After the sale, in May 1968, WPHL-TV built a new tower and transmitter facility in Roxborough, separate from the Wyndmoor studio site, with an effective radiated power of 4.3 million watts.

WPHL-TV, which launched with 76ers games, built an identity as a sports station. It made history in 1969 as the first UHF independent station to air a scheduled regular-season pro football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Colts; the game had been delayed from Sunday to Monday night due to the World Series being played in Baltimore, but WCAU-TV (channel 10), Philadelphia&#x27;s CBS affiliate, refused to air it to prioritize prime time programming. In November 1970, the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team announced the move of their telecasts from WFIL-TV (channel 6), the team&#x27;s broadcaster for 21 seasons, in a three-year deal for 70 games a season. This came after AVC acquired the rightsholder from Phillies owner R. R. M. Carpenter Jr. The next season, WPHL dropped the 76ers to carry Big 5 college basketball, which it believed more popular. In 1974, the station broadcast road games of the Philadelphia Bell in the World Football League.

U.S. Communications considered WPHL-TV its flagship station; it was the strongest ratings performer of the three Philadelphia-market independent stations, with a sign-on–sign-off audience share of 7 percent in November 1969, and the number-one UHF independent nationwide in prime time. WPHL-TV was reportedly the company&#x27;s only moneymaker when, in October 1970, Stevens was promoted to chief operating officer in an executive reshuffle. At that time, WPHL-TV was detached from U.S. Communications into a separate entity, WPHL-TV Inc. This situation reflected the wide gap in outcomes between WPHL-TV and the other stations. Over the course of 1971, every other U.S. Communications station was threatened with closure: KEMO-TV in San Francisco and WATL-TV in Atlanta were shuttered in March due to low advertising revenues, and the group intended to do the same to WXIX-TV in Cincinnati and WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh that August; WPGH-TV shut down, though the Cincinnati station was ultimately spared and sold to Metromedia. However, WPHL-TV was frequently linked in rumors to financial difficulties of its own, including by creditors of the other AVC stations, and management admitted its sale was a possibility. An attempt to sell the station to Music Fair Enterprises in 1972 fell through. After the transaction was called off, it emerged that the primary reason was a $2.2 million lawsuit filed by program distributor MCA Television for licensing fees it claimed to be owed.

After prior sale attempts, and in spite of the fact that channel 17 was losing money, AVC instead invested in WPHL-TV. In 1975, it moved from Wyndmoor, as well as sales offices on Walnut Street, into a converted A&amp;P grocery store in Philadelphia&#x27;s Wynnefield neighborhood. That same year, Gene McCurdy became channel 17&#x27;s new general manager less than a month after being ousted from WPVI-TV.

During the 1970s, channel 17 had a host for horror movies: Joseph Zawislak, better known as Dr. Shock, who developed his on-air persona in the mold of John Zacherle on WCAU-TV. Zawislak&#x27;s 13-week trial as a host was ended by station management due to low ratings, but after receiving thousands of letters and cards in protest of the cancellation, management reversed its decision and brought him back, first on Saturday nights and later Saturday afternoons; he was the station&#x27;s among highest-rated programs outside of Phillies games. His young daughter Doreen, known on air as &quot;Bubbles&quot;, frequently appeared. Zawislak, a magician, died of a heart attack in 1979.

==Providence Journal Company ownership==
As early as 1976, AVC sought to shed non-core business areas and focus on its industrial activities. As a result, it sold WPHL-TV in 1978 for $10 million to the Providence Journal Company (ProJo), publisher of the namesake newspaper in Providence, Rhode Island, and owner of two radio stations there. It was ProJo&#x27;s first television station. The new ownership made a visible commitment to the station; in 1979, it increased the rights fees it paid to the Phillies just so the team could sign free agent Pete Rose.

In 1981, Taft Broadcasting—owner of channel 29, by this time WTAF-TV—acquired a 47-percent stake in the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team as part of a group headed by team executive Bill Giles. Immediately, it was announced that Phillies games would move to channel 29 beginning in 1984, after the existing WPHL-TV contract ended; this was brought forward a year to 1983 after Taft negotiated a buyout of channel 17&#x27;s final year on the contract. Simultaneously, in part filling the gap on its schedule, WPHL-TV became the new television home of the Philadelphia 76ers, previously broadcast by WKBS-TV. Beyond sports, WPHL-TV produced &quot;Dancin&#x27; on Air&quot;, a teen dance show, beginning in 1981. The program, originally co-hosted by Eddie Bruce and Bill O&#x27;Brien and later by just O&#x27;Brien, originated from the WPHL-TV studios as well as theme parks and beaches around the Philadelphia market. Later, a national version, &quot;Dance Party USA&quot;, was produced from the WPHL-TV studios for the USA Network; it taped at channel 17 until 1988 and aired until June 1992.

WPHL-TV was the principal beneficiary of the closure of one of its primary competitors. WKBS-TV left the air in August 1983 after no buyer came forward and its owner, Field Enterprises, wished to liquidate. The vast majority of the WKBS-TV program inventory was purchased by the Providence Journal Company for WPHL-TV alongside a $500,000 package of cameras, video tape, and editing equipment.

==New Taft Broadcasting ownership==
ProJo put WPHL-TV on the market in June 1986 without stating a reason, though it also noted that it had received a number of unsolicited offers. By that time, WPHL-TV was holding on to second in total-day share among the three major Philadelphia independents; the new third station was WGBS-TV (channel 57), owned by Milton Grant, which went on the air in late 1985 and seven months later risen to either a tie for second with WPHL or a narrow third-place finish, depending on the ratings survey. Five months later, the company opted not to sell WPHL-TV; it had not found a buyer at its reported $100 million asking price amid a national fall in independent TV station valuations. Seven potential buyers toured the station and a dozen or more showed interest.

A deal seemed on again in June 1987 when ProJo announced the sale of WPHL-TV to Odyssey Partners, owner of part or all of four television stations in the eastern U.S. Odyssey had bid about $65 million, but two factors contributed to the collapse of its deal. News of a sale generated additional offers for WPHL-TV from companies that reportedly included Tribune Broadcasting and MCA, each owners of major-market independent stations. At the same time, WGBS-TV owner Grant Broadcasting System was in bankruptcy reorganization, and Odyssey&#x27;s financiers pulled out when they heard of the proposed reorganization plan that would give creditors control of the company. On July 14, 1987, it transpired that Dudley Taft Communications had acquired the station and that Randy Smith, the general manager of WTAF-TV (which Taft Broadcasting had recently sold to TVX Broadcast Group), was leaving channel 29 to join Taft at channel 17. Dudley Taft Communications was a new company owned by the Taft family, the former owners and namesake of Taft Broadcasting; Dudley Taft had been outbid in his attempt to complete a leveraged buyout of that company earlier in the year.

Dudley&#x27;s firm, retaining the Taft Broadcasting name, took control on December 29, 1987, and immediately fired six of the nine department chiefs, including general manager Gene McCurdy after a 12-year tenure, making way for five former WTAF-TV executives to replace them. Several other WTAF-TV employees moved over to channel 17 after the change in ownership. Randy Smith outlined a strategy of using the new executives&#x27; connections made while at WTAF to compete more vigorously with that station; expressed interest in becoming a Fox affiliate if TVX were ever to sell channel 29; and considered the possibility of starting a newscast &quot;after 1989&quot;.

In 1991, the 76ers restructured their deal to reduce the number of games televised from 41 to 10, apparently backing away from a plan to put all games on cable. Channel 17 also became the broadcast home of Philadelphia Flyers hockey, though with fewer games per season than WGBS-TV had offered, and began an effort to win back rights to the Phillies, whose contract with WTXF-TV expired after 1992. That station in turn could no longer accommodate baseball on its own because of increasing programming commitments from Fox and resulting pressure from the network. In January 1992, WPHL-TV and the Phillies announced a five-year deal for 85 regular-season telecasts beginning in 1993.

==Tribune Broadcasting ownership==
===Acquisition===
The new Taft Broadcasting suffered from a high debt load, and in November 1991, it opted to sell its other TV station—WGHP in High Point, North Carolina—back to Great American Communications Company, the original Taft Broadcasting. Days later, Taft announced that Tribune Broadcasting had become an &quot;investment partner&quot; in a $19 million cash infusion that also granted Tribune an option to buy WPHL-TV outright; in the new arrangement, Dudley Taft would continue to run the station with the existing management; he told &quot;Broadcasting&quot; that the deals were &quot;a response to current conditions that anyone who started business in the late 1980s has had to make&quot;. Tribune completed the investment before 1991 closed and then received FCC approval to acquire channel 17 outright, which at the time required a waiver because Tribune also owned WPIX in New York City. In filings with the FCC, Taft indicated that Tribune was likely the only buyer with enough capital to prevent the station from filing for bankruptcy.

Tribune was one of the first affiliate partners for The WB, a new national television network that launched in January 1995; WPHL-TV was committed to the new network upon its November 1993 announcement. The 76ers switched broadcast partners to WGBS-TV for the 1994–95 season. Beginning in 1995, channel 17 became the new home of the Mummers Parade on New Year&#x27;s Day, taking over from KYW-TV after more than a decade.

===&quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot;===
In January 1994, WPHL-TV and Knight-Ridder, publisher of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, announced an association to create and present a nightly, hour-long 10 p.m. newscast utilizing the resources of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. The program was produced by KR Video, a subsidiary of Knight-Ridder, from a newsroom and set at WPHL-TV&#x27;s studios. After two two-week delays, &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot; made its first broadcast on September 26, 1994, promising viewers &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s news now&quot;. Its lead anchors came from other cities. Jim Watkins had last worked in Cincinnati, and Victoria Hong came from Buffalo; both departed by the end of 1995.

&quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot; was beset with difficulties in making the specialties of a newspaper work in a television news format; &quot;The Inquirer&quot; television critic, Jonathan Storm, found the quality of stories delivered by the print and broadcast journalists uneven. The Newspaper Guild&#x27;s insistence that &quot;Inquirer&quot; staffers be compensated led to a boycott that began in December 1994 and ended in August 1995; the boycott was later cited as a reason for the program&#x27;s demise. Other contributing factors included baseball and hockey strikes that deprived &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot; of sports lead-ins at launch; a lack of a sound business plan; and low ratings against WTXF-TV&#x27;s established 10 p.m. newscast.

===&quot;WB17 News at Ten&quot; and news outsourcing===
After being shortened to 30 minutes in June 1996, the &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot; partnership was disbanded. The last edition of &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot; aired on December 29, 1996; the next day, WPHL-TV assumed full control of the news department, retaining three-fourths of the staff, and began airing the &quot;WB17 News at Ten&quot; in its stead. The weeknight co-anchors of &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot;, Steve Highsmith and Toni Yates, were assigned to anchor the weeknight and weekend editions of the retooled newscast.

In 1997, channel 17 became the television home of Philadelphia Eagles preseason games, pre- and postgame shows, and coaches&#x27; shows; the relationship lasted seven years before KYW-TV took over in 2003. The growth of The WB as well as a desire to protect the 10 p.m. newscast put an end to the station&#x27;s relationship with the Phillies; ratings had declined since the first season in 1993, when the Phillies won the National League pennant. After the 1998 season, the Phillies and WPHL-TV attempted to negotiate a renewal, but channel 17 offered to telecast just 35 to 40 games a season. This was unsatisfactory to the club, leading to a deal for 70 games on WPSG.

Over the course of the early 2000s, WPHL-TV continued tinkering with its newscast, which was behind WTXF-TV in the ratings. In 2000, Leslie Glenn moved from Tribune-owned WLVI to become WPHL-TV&#x27;s general manager. She moved to rebrand the season as &quot;Philadelphia&#x27;s WB17&quot;, committed to an expansion of the 10 p.m. news to an hour, and expressed a desire to add more newscasts in other dayparts. At the time, of Tribune&#x27;s stations in the top six television markets, WPHL was the only one with just one daily newscast. Sportscaster Mike Dardis was named news anchor, replacing Highsmith, who moved into a role of chief political correspondent, and Mike Missanelli, a sports talk host at WIP, replaced Dardis on sports. The hour-long news debuted September 12, 2001, nearly a week ahead of schedule, after the September 11 attacks. In the first major ratings survey after the move to an hour, WPHL had a 3% share compared to WTXF&#x27;s 7%. The newscast was trimmed back to 30 minutes on January 1, 2004, after Glenn was replaced by Vincent Giannini of WPIX; Giannini believed the newscast had been more successful and more differentiated as a half-hour product. By February 2005, the ratings competition at 10 p.m. had become more lopsided, with WTXF attracting a 9% share and WPHL a 3% share.

On September 21, 2005, WPHL-TV fired its entire 30-person news staff, effective December 9, and outsourced its 10 p.m. newscast to NBC-owned WCAU. The continued low ratings no longer supported the costs to maintain a standalone news department. The move was part of an expansion of an existing relationship between NBC and Tribune; Tribune&#x27;s WBZL in Miami had been airing a newscast from the NBC station there since 1997, and simultaneous with the Philadelphia move, Tribune outsourced the newscast at its WB affiliate in San Diego. On December 12, the WCAU newscast launched, retaining the title &quot;WB17 News at Ten&quot; but featuring WCAU on-air presenters including Vince DeMentri, Lori Delgado, and Vai Sikahema on weeknights and meteorologist Amy Freeze on weekends.

===From WB to MyNetworkTV===
On January 24, 2006, the merger of The WB and rival UPN into The CW was announced. Twelve CBS-owned UPN stations and 16 Tribune Broadcasting stations were chosen as charter affiliates of The CW, but in Philadelphia, WPSG was chosen over WPHL-TV. WPHL-TV and Tribune-owned stations in two other conflict markets that had similarly been bypassed—WATL in Atlanta and KTWB-TV in Seattle—signed affiliation agreements in May with MyNetworkTV, set up by Fox Television Stations to serve its own ex-UPN outlets and other displaced stations. The station rebranded as &quot;MyPHL17&quot; ahead of the affiliation change.

For the first time since 1998 and the third time overall, the Philadelphia Phillies returned to WPHL-TV beginning with the 2009 season, coming off their World Series win the year before; the three-year deal included 45 regular-season baseball games a season. The relationship ended after the 2013 season when the Phillies signed a 25-year rights deal with Comcast SportsNet (now NBC Sports Philadelphia); Comcast by that point owned NBC and placed some games on WCAU instead.

On October 31, 2011, WPHL-TV debuted a morning news program, using Tribune&#x27;s &quot;EyeOpener&quot; format. This combined local inserts with a national program, produced out of Tribune-owned KDAF in Dallas, and was launched there and in Philadelphia and three other markets.

For 2018, WPHL-TV joined WPVI-TV as a broadcaster of Philadelphia Union soccer, with WPVI producing the telecasts but WPHL broadcasting most games. The deal with both broadcasters was renewed in 2020, but after the 2022 season, all local television rights agreements in Major League Soccer were discontinued to make way for MLS&#x27;s 10-year deal with Apple. WPHL continued its association with the club by airing a weekly coaches&#x27; show, &quot;Union Insider&quot;, in 2023.

==Nexstar ownership and CW switch==
Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in Tribune debt. The deal received significant scrutiny over Sinclair&#x27;s forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, prompting the FCC to designate it for hearing and leading Tribune to terminate the deal and sue Sinclair for breach of contract.

Following the Sinclair deal&#x27;s collapse, Nexstar Media Group of Irving, Texas, announced its purchase of Tribune Media on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.

In October 2022, Nexstar Media Group acquired a 75-percent stake in The CW. A provision in the contract released CBS, one of its former owners, from its affiliation agreements for eight CW stations, including WPSG in Philadelphia, on September 1, 2023. In three of the eight markets, Nexstar-owned stations—including WPHL-TV—assumed the CW affiliation on that date, with MyNetworkTV programming continuing on a subchannel. Giannini retired after 20 years in 2024 and was replaced as general manager by Lloyd Bucher, previously of WJZY in Charlotte, North Carolina.

===Newscasts===

After nearly seven years with news produced by WCAU, WPHL-TV contracted with WPVI-TV for a 10 p.m. newscast beginning September 15, 2012. The new &quot;Action News at 10 on PHL17&quot; featured WPVI&#x27;s existing 4 p.m. anchor team. Initially a 30-minute program like the WCAU-produced newscast it replaced, &quot;Action News at 10&quot; expanded to an hour in September 2014.

WPHL-TV debuted an in-house morning newscast by 2015, which aired alongside &quot;EyeOpener&quot; and later &quot;Morning Dose&quot;, another syndicated morning news effort produced by Tribune. &quot;Morning Dose&quot; shut down in 2018, and WPHL&#x27;s morning newscast was expanded from 90 minutes to three hours to fill the gap. It was four hours long by 2020.

===Sports===
In 2018, WPHL-TV became the broadcast home of Philadelphia Wings (2018–present) lacrosse with a schedule including all home and select away games. In more recent years, the station has shared the schedule; for the 2021–22 season, it was a co-partner with NBC Sports Philadelphia, and in 2024–25, it was scheduled to show two games while WPSG was to air 14 contests.

WPHL-TV began broadcasting a digital signal using channel 54 on October 31, 2002. The analog signal on channel 17 was shut down on June 12, 2009, as part of the digital television transition, and the digital signal moved to channel 17 on that date. In 2017, WPHL-TV began broadcasting WUVP-DT (channel 65), the Univision station for Philadelphia, from its transmitter after Univision sold its spectrum in the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction and entering into a channel sharing agreement to broadcast its programming using the WPHL-TV transmitter.

<text>Armagh City Football Club is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Championship.

==History==
The club was founded in 1964 as Milford Everton in the village of Milford, just outside Armagh city. The original name was in honour of the founders&#x27; favourite English team, Everton. Milford was the village were the penalty kick was first introduced in 1890 when local goalkeeper William McCrum suggested a way to combat illegal challenges near to goal. Milford Everton eventually bought and refurbished the McCrum Institute in the early 1980s as they strove to improve facilities for the &#x27;B&#x27; Division. The club was renamed Armagh City after relocating to Armagh in 1988. They played at the Mill Field, Armagh from 1988 to 1993, when they moved to their current ground, Holm Park. They achieved senior status in 1999, but reverted to intermediate status in 2003 when the Irish Premier League was established and the number of senior clubs was reduced from 20 to 16. In 2005, however, City gained promotion to the Premier League, but after three more seasons at senior level, the club failed to gain a place in the 12-club IFA Premiership and reverted once more to intermediate status as a member of the IFA Championship. The club&#x27;s colours are azure and black stripes. Former player Marty Rice was named first team manager on 10 July 2010, having been assistant to Ivor McGucken at the start of the 2009–10 season.

During the 2011–12 season Armagh City entered into negotiations with various bodies including the IFA, Armagh City and District Council and SportNI to secure funding to replace their grass pitch with the latest, FIFA approved, 3rd generation pitch. The pitch was laid in summer 2013 and opened in September 2013. The first game for the first team was on 14 September 2013 - a 5–1 win against Lurgan Celtic in the Bob Radcliffe Cup.

Luke Grimley was the last player to score on the old Holm Park in a 1–0 win over rivals Loughgall which clinched the Championship reserve league title managed by Mickey O’Neill and captained by Cillian Sheridan, while Shea McGerrigan was the first player to score in the new Holm Park with a 5–1 win over Lurgan Celtic.

In the 2011–12 season Armagh City F.C. Youth (U18) created history by winning their first ever national trophy, the Harry Cavan Irish Youth Cup, defeating Cliftonville 1–0 in the final with a goal from Barry Quinn, the side was managed by John Hynds and Martin Grimley, and captained by Matthew Hynds. On the run to the final the Eagles defeated, Ballymoney United 9–0, Woodvale F.C. 7-0 and Glenavon F.C. 3–1. In a successful year for the youth side they also lifted the League title undefeated and the League Cup completing an impressive domestic treble.

In the 2013–14 season Armagh City F.C. won the double by winning the league and Bob Radcliffe Cup, the side, captained by Liam Cullen also reached the Intermediate Cup Final but were defeated by Bangor F.C. 2–1.

The club over the years has reached several Mid Ulster Cup finals with a reasonably large following and have came close to promotion to the NIFL Premiership. The club was relegated to the Premier Intermediate League in the 2016–17 season following a disappointing 7–1 loss to Newry City in the championship relegation play off over two legs. Manager Marty Rice then resigned.

In the summer of 2017 former Cliftonville player Joe Kerr took over as manager of the club for the 2017/18 season with Alex Clifford and Mickey O&#x27;Neill as his assistants. Kerr departed from the club in June 2021, with his successor, Shea Campbell being appointed the following day.

In the 2023–24 season, Armagh finished second in the Premier Intermediate with 52 points. This gave them a chance of promotion to the NIFL Championship via the promotion play-offs. Armagh faced Dergview. The first leg resulted in a draw, whilst the second ended in a penalty shoot-out. Armagh won the shoot-out 6–5 to secure a place in the second tier of Northern Irish football for the following season.

<text>Newsham Park (locally ) in Liverpool, England is a Victorian public park. To the east of it is the Canada Dock branch railway line, and to the north is West Derby Road. The park is protected as a Grade II* listed site.

==History==
The park was opened in 1868. In 1877, it was the site for that year&#x27;s Royal Agricultural Show.

Newsham Park was the first individual work of the landscape architect Edward Kemp, an understudy of Joseph Paxton who was responsible for the grounds at Chatsworth House and the design of Birkenhead Park, a city park that became a working model for the creation of Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park.

==Facilities and attractions==
* The Grade II listed Newsham House, where Queen Victoria once stayed. Now used as Judges&#x27; lodgings.
* The Grade II listed Seamen&#x27;s Orphan Institution.
* Fishing lakes with roach, carp and tench (registration permit required).
* Children&#x27;s play area
* Lakeview Kiosk (open 9 am-5 pm)

==Description==
The park is part of a set of Victorian public parks within Liverpool, including Stanley Park, Walton Hall Park, Princes Park and the largest of the group, Sefton Park.

It is built on land purchased by the Liverpool Corporation from the Molyneux Estate. The development of the park was funded by the sale of plots for the construction of housing. Consequently, the park is fringed by Victorian housing, some of which is currently empty and derelict. The area has been awarded Conservation Area status, a legal protection against development to protect and preserve the Victorian architecture.

The park contains two large lakes, the smaller of which hosts the sailing of model boats. The larger lake historically offered rowing boats for hire, but they are no longer present. It is currently used for fishing. The lake has a historical reputation linked to the matrons of the former orphanage, who allegedly employed extreme disciplinary measures on unruly children. According to accounts, they would submerge the children&#x27;s heads in the water until the brink of drowning, only releasing them when they were in a state of distress and pleading for the practice to cease. It is now reported that visitors have heard the sounds of children screaming near the lake during the night, along with the bubbling of the water.

==Buildings==

The park also has several important buildings, including the Grade II listed Seaman&#x27;s Orphanage — a building later converted to Newsham Park Hospital and subsequently earmarked for development as luxury apartments, which never happened. most notably due to the extensive sightings of supernatural activity. Another building within the park is Newsham House, which is the residence for judges attending the Crown Court in Liverpool and was visited by Queen Victoria.

In 2004 work commenced on the Academy of St. Francis of Assisi, a secondary school (11–16) under the UK Government&#x27;s City Academy programme. The school is a modern four-storey building at the western end of the park, and its contemporary style caused some friction with local residents who felt that it was at odds with the park&#x27;s Conservation Area status.

The now-closed Stanley railway station was located in the south east corner and the similarly closed Tue Brook railway station to the north east.

==Present day==
The park has been placed by English Heritage on its Heritage at Risk list because of its &quot;poor&quot; condition and because the trend is towards deterioration.

On the 30 July 2012 Newsham Park&#x27;s lakes were temporarily closed due to potentially toxic blue-green algae. They were later reopened.

In 2012 a Kiosk was built, which opens from 9 am to 5 pm.

<doc id="1345759" wikidata="Q5578935" url="?curid=1345759" title="Gold key">
<text>In fiction, a gold key is a special token granting access to and control of a mythical or ultra-private or secret bank account or vault, such as a Swiss bank account. In reality, the key is often a code word and accounts are not completely anonymous.
A real &quot;gold key&quot; need not be made of or colored gold, or even a key. If it is a key it may not fit any lock; the keys are important as authentication tokens, not always as literal keys. 

While Swiss law formerly granted nearly complete financial privacy, fully anonymous accounts are no longer available. Swiss banks are now required by law to obtain identifying information from any prospective clients. International pressure related to efforts to trace and identify terrorists and drug traffickers has eliminated the anonymous &quot;Swiss bank account&quot; that has appeared in numerous books and films and conspiracy theories. Other countries still offer offshore bank accounts with varying degrees of anonymity in transactions.

The arrival of a &quot;gold key client&quot; typically results in an extra flurry of attention. A number of plot devices detail the method of authentication of the account-holder, adding to the mystery and drama of the client&#x27;s arrival. It is a common literary device that banks do not admit publicly that &quot;gold key&quot; accounts actually exist, and characters are therefore invested into a sort of secret society when they are offered such an account.

In the best-selling novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, the heroine Sophie Neveu is given a gold key by her grandfather. The gold key bears the logo of the Priory of Sion, a secret society, which leads Neveu and co-hero Robert Langdon to guess the code associated with the key.

In Lewis Perdue&#x27;s &quot;Daughter of God&quot; there is a gold key which is hidden in a painting (&quot;The Home of the Lady of Our Redeemer&quot;). This gold key (accompanied by a gold ingot with the account number) allows access to a safe deposit box in a Zurich bank. The key does not actually open a lock as such.

In the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling, the wizarding bank Gringotts uses gold keys, among other devices, to protect the security of its vaults which contain wizards&#x27; gold hoards.

<text>In geometry, a position or position vector, also known as location vector or radius vector, is a Euclidean vector that represents a point &quot;P&quot; in space. Its length represents the distance in relation to an arbitrary reference origin &quot;O&quot;, and its direction represents the angular orientation with respect to given reference axes. Usually denoted x, r, or s, it corresponds to the straight line segment from &quot;O&quot; to &quot;P&quot;.
In other words, it is the displacement or translation that maps the origin to &quot;P&quot;:

:formula_1

The term position vector is used mostly in the fields of differential geometry, mechanics and occasionally vector calculus.
Frequently this is used in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, but can be easily generalized to Euclidean spaces and affine spaces of any dimension.

==Relative position==

The relative position of a point &quot;Q&quot; with respect to point &quot;P&quot; is the Euclidean vector resulting from the subtraction of the two absolute position vectors (each with respect to the origin):
:formula_2
where formula_3.
The &quot;relative direction&quot; between two points is their relative position normalized as a unit vector.

==Definition and representation==
===Three dimensions===

In three dimensions, any set of three-dimensional coordinates and their corresponding basis vectors can be used to define the location of a point in space—whichever is the simplest for the task at hand may be used.

Commonly, one uses the familiar Cartesian coordinate system, or sometimes spherical polar coordinates, or cylindrical coordinates:

:formula_4

where &quot;t&quot; is a parameter, owing to their rectangular or circular symmetry. These different coordinates and corresponding basis vectors represent the same position vector. More general curvilinear coordinates could be used instead and are in contexts like continuum mechanics and general relativity (in the latter case one needs an additional time coordinate).

===&quot;n&quot; dimensions===

Linear algebra allows for the abstraction of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional position vector. A position vector can be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors:

:formula_5

The set of all position vectors forms position space (a vector space whose elements are the position vectors), since positions can be added (vector addition) and scaled in length (scalar multiplication) to obtain another position vector in the space. The notion of &quot;space&quot; is intuitive, since each &quot;xi&quot; (&quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot;) can have any value, the collection of values defines a point in space.

The &quot;dimension&quot; of the position space is &quot;n&quot; (also denoted dim(&quot;R&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;). The &quot;coordinates&quot; of the vector r with respect to the basis vectors e&quot;i&quot; are &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The vector of coordinates forms the coordinate vector or &quot;n&quot;-tuple (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, …, &quot;xn&quot;).

Each coordinate &quot;xi&quot; may be parameterized a number of parameters &quot;t&quot;. One parameter &quot;xi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) would describe a curved 1D path, two parameters &quot;xi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1, &quot;t&quot;2) describes a curved 2D surface, three &quot;xi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1, &quot;t&quot;2, &quot;t&quot;3) describes a curved 3D volume of space, and so on.

The linear span of a basis set &quot;B&quot; = {e1, e2, …, e&quot;n&quot;} equals the position space &quot;R&quot;, denoted span(&quot;B&quot;) = &quot;R&quot;.

==Applications==

===Differential geometry===

Position vector fields are used to describe continuous and differentiable space curves, in which case the independent parameter needs not be time, but can be (e.g.) arc length of the curve.

===Mechanics===

In any equation of motion, the position vector r(&quot;t&quot;) is usually the most sought-after quantity because this function defines the motion of a particle (i.e. a point mass) – its location relative to a given coordinate system at some time &quot;t&quot;.

To define motion in terms of position, each coordinate may be parametrized by time; since each successive value of time corresponds to a sequence of successive spatial locations given by the coordinates, the continuum limit of many successive locations is a path the particle traces.

In the case of one dimension, the position has only one component, so it effectively degenerates to a scalar coordinate. It could be, say, a vector in the &quot;x&quot; direction, or the radial &quot;r&quot; direction. Equivalent notations include

:formula_6

==Derivatives==

For a position vector r that is a function of time &quot;t&quot;, the time derivatives can be computed with respect to &quot;t&quot;. These derivatives have common utility in the study of kinematics, control theory, engineering and other sciences.

;Velocity
:formula_7
:where dr is an infinitesimally small displacement (vector).
;Acceleration
:formula_8
;Jerk
:formula_9

These names for the first, second and third derivative of position are commonly used in basic kinematics. By extension, the higher-order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion. Study of these higher-order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as a sum of an infinite sequence, enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics.

<doc id="1345772" wikidata="Q235229" url="?curid=1345772" title="Shen Xue">
<text>Shen Xue (; born 13 November 1978) is a Chinese retired pair skater. With her husband Zhao Hongbo, Shen is the 2010 Olympic champion, the 2002 &amp; 2006 Olympic bronze medalist, a three-time World champion (2002, 2003 and 2007), a three-time Four Continents Champion (1999, 2003 &amp; 2007), and a six-time Grand Prix Final champion (1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2006 &amp; 2009).

Shen and Zhao were the first Chinese pair team to win a medal at an International Skating Union event and at the World Figure Skating Championships. In 2002, they became the first Chinese pair skating team to win a World Championship. They are also the first Chinese pair skaters to win a medal at the Winter Olympic Games. In 2010, they became the first Chinese skaters to win the gold medal at a Winter Olympic Games in any figure skating category, ending almost half a century of Russian and Soviet pair skating dominance.

==Personal life==
Shen was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, China. Shen and Zhao announced their engagement after the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. They were married shortly after.

Shen and Zhao are the parents of a daughter, born 3 September 2013.

In December 2017, it was announced that Shen had been appointed as President of the Chinese Skating Association.

==Career==

===Early career and development===
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo began skating together in 1992. Yao Bin coached them early in their careers. They competed at their first Olympics in 1998, in Nagano, Japan, where they finished fifth. They went on to the 1999 World Figure Skating Championships a year later with improved choreography and expression, and won the silver medal, becoming the first Chinese team to win a World Championship medal.

=== International success ===
Shen and Zhao improved each year, and were considered to be one of the top teams in the world. They won another silver medal at the Worlds in 2000, and a bronze in 2001. They were considered strong medal contenders in the 2002 Winter Olympics. They won the bronze with a strong performance, missing a throw quadruple salchow attempt. They became the first Chinese pair to win a medal at an Olympics for figure skating.

===World Champions===
At the 2002 World Figure Skating Championships held in Nagano, Japan, Shen and Zhao won their first World Championship, becoming the first Chinese pair skaters to win a gold medal in the history of figure skating. Later in March 2003, as the defending world champions, the team also won their second World Championship in Washington D.C., United States. While practising their throw quadruple salchow, Shen landed badly and injured her landing foot and ankle. She required several treatments to numb the foot entirely so that she should compete. The pair performed a brilliant long program that earned them several perfect 6.0&#x27;s for both technical merits and presentation.

In the 2003–2004 season, competing for the first time under the Code of Points, they placed second at the 2003 Skate Canada and won the 2003 Cup of China. They won their third Grand Prix Final gold medal at the 2003–2004 Grand prix Final, where they won both the short program with 66.00 points and the free skate with 130.08. The team earned a total of 196.08 points to finish 18.78 points ahead of their new rivals Tatiana Totmianina &amp; Maxim Marinin of Russia, who were second in both the short and the long program.

Their attempt to win a third straight World title in 2004 was thwarted when Zhao fell during their short program and the team placed fourth in that segment. They rebounded to win the free program with a string of 6.0s, and moved up to finish second overall behind Tatiana Totmianina &amp; Maxim Marinin.

===Injury and 2006 Olympics===
Shen and Zhao won gold medals at the 2004 Skate Canada, at the 2004 Trophée Eric Bompard and at the 2004 Cup of China. Following their wins at all their Grand Prix events, they also won the 2004–2005 Grand Prix Final in Beijing, China, placing first in the short program with 70.52 points and in the free skate scoring 136.02. Overall they won the gold medal earning a total of 206.54 points, 19.22 ahead of Maria Petrova &amp; Alexei Tikhonov, who placed second in both segments of the competition. As a result, they set a new world record for the short program, for the free skate and for the combined total score under the ISU Judging System.

In 2005 Zhao&#x27;s Achilles tendon injury forced them to withdraw from the World Championships, and weeks later, he ruptured the tendon during practice. They missed the entire competitive season and were unable to return to the ice until weeks before the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. They placed fifth in the short program with 62.32 points and third in the free skate with 124.59. Their lack of adequate preparation was obvious, but they managed to win a second Olympic bronze medal earning 186.91 points, 17.57 points behind Tatiana Totmianina &amp; Maxim Marinin, who won the gold medal.

===Third World title and retirement===
The 2006–2007 proved to be a very strong season for the pair. They began winning the 2006 Cup of China, where they came in first place in the short program and in the free skate to win the competition with a total score of 193.59 points, 21.03 ahead of Zhang Dan &amp; Zhang Hao. They also won the 2006 NHK Trophy, where they also placed first in both the short program and the free skate earning 190.97 points, beating Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian by 8.13. They earned the gold medal at the 2006–2007 Grand Prix Final, held in Saint Petersburg, Russia. At that competition, they won the short program, scoring 68.66 points, 4.48 points ahead of Zhang Dan &amp; Zhang Hao. The team also placed first in the free skate with 134.53 points, 12.68 ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy from Germany. They earned a total of 203.19 points to finish 22.52 points ahead of second-place finishers Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy.

At the 2007 Asian Winter Games, Shen and Zhao won the short program with 69.49 points, leading by 3.84 over the rest of the field. They placed first in free skate scoring 126.06 points, winning that segment as well by 10.24 points. They earned 195.55 points overall, edging their teammates Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian by 14.08 points, who placed second in both the short program and the free skate. Shen and Zhao won the 2007 Four Continents Championships, placing first in the short program with 69.29 points, 3.49 ahead of the rest of the competitors. They also won the free skate earning 133.76 points, leading that segment of the competition by 14.23 points. As a result, they scored a combined total of 203.05 points to win the competition 17.72 points ahead of Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian, who again came in second place in the short and in the long program.

Shen and Zhao finished the season with their third world title at the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships in Tokyo, Japan, placing first in the short program with 71.07 points, taking the lead by 3.42 points ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy, and setting a new world record under the ISU Judging System. They also won the free skate with 132.43 points, 10.72 ahead of Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian, who placed second in that segment of the competition. Overall they scored a total 203.50 points and won by a 15.04-point margin of victory over silver medalists Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian. Following the win, they married and announced their retirement from the sport.

===Return to competition===
Shen and Zhao returned to competition in the 2009–2010 season to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics, and were assigned to 2009 Cup of China and 2009 Skate America in the 2009–2010 ISU Grand Prix series.

At the 2009 Cup of China, they placed first in the short program earning a personal best score of 72.28. They also won the free skate scoring 128.69 to win the competition with 200.97 points, 14.18 points ahead of silver medalists Zhang Dan &amp; Zhang Hao. At the 2009 Skate America, they placed first in the short program with a new personal best of 74.36 points. They also lead in the free skate where they earned 127.04 points. Scoring 201.40 points overall, 29.58 points over Tatiana Volosozhar &amp; Stanislav Morozov, they won the gold medal.

Those two wins directly qualified them for the 2009–2010 Grand Prix Final that was held in Tokyo, Japan, in December 2009. At the event, they lead the short program with a new personal best of 75.36 points, 2.22 points ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy, who were second. They also placed first in the free skate with another personal best of 138.89 points, 5.07 ahead of fellow second-place finishers Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian. They won the gold medal earning 214.25 points overall, edging silver medalists Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian by 12.39 points and improving their previous combined total score. At the competition, they set new world records for the short program, for the free skating and for the combined total under the ISU Judging System.

===2010 Olympics===

On 14 February 2010, Shen and Zhao began their fourth Olympics. They led the short program with 76.66 points, 0.70 ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy. They achieved a new personal best and set a new record score again under the ISU Judging System for the short program.

On 15 February 2010, in the pairs&#x27; free skating they came second, again with a personal best score of 139.91 points, 1.90 behind Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian, who claimed the silver medal. Their program components score of 72.40 was the highest of the event. They also got a 10.00 for interpretation from one judge. With an overall total of 216.57 points they finished in first place taking the gold medal, by a 3.26 margin over Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian and a 5.77 margin over bronze medalists Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy. Their combined score was a world record at the time. At 31 and 36 years old respectively, they were among the oldest Olympic champions in figure skating. They became the first Chinese skaters in any figure skating discipline to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympic Games. China at the event also broke Russia&#x27;s 46-year twelve-Olympic gold medal streak in pairs figure skating, winning both the gold and the silver medals.

===Final retirement ===

On 17 February 2010, they announced their definite retirement from competitive skating to focus on their personal life. They said they would retire from shows in 2012, planning to start a family, promote their sport, and begin coaching.

<doc id="1345780" wikidata="Q1968853" url="?curid=1345780" title="Richard III (1955 film)">
<text>Richard III is a 1955 British Technicolor film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s historical play of the same name, also incorporating elements from his &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;. It was directed and produced by Laurence Olivier, who also played the lead role. Featuring many noted Shakespearean actors, including a quartet of knights, the film depicts Richard plotting and conspiring to grasp the throne from his brother King Edward IV, played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke. In the process, many are killed and betrayed, with Richard&#x27;s evil leading to his own downfall. The prologue of the film states that history without its legends would be &quot;a dry matter indeed&quot;, implicitly admitting to the artistic licence that Shakespeare applied to the events of the time.

Of the three Shakespearean films directed by Olivier, &quot;Richard III&quot; received the least critical praise at the time, although it was still acclaimed. It was the only one not to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, though Olivier&#x27;s performance was nominated. The British Film Institute has pointed out that, given the enormous TV audience it received when shown in the United States on NBC in 1956, the film &quot;may have done more to popularise Shakespeare than any other single work&quot;. The film gained further popularity in the US through a 1966 re-release, which broke box office records in many US cities. Many critics now consider Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; his best Shakespearean screen adaptation. 

==Plot==
King Edward IV of England (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) has been placed on the throne with the help of his brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Sir Laurence Olivier). After Edward&#x27;s coronation in the Great Hall, with his brothers George and Richard watching, he leaves with his wife and sons. Richard contemplates the throne, before advancing towards the audience and then addressing them, delivering a speech that outlines his physical deformities, including a hunched back and a withered arm. He goes on to describe his jealousy over his brother&#x27;s rise to power in contrast to his lowly position.

Richard dedicates himself to task and plans to frame his other brother, George, Duke of Clarence (Sir John Gielgud), for conspiring to kill the King, and to have George sent to the Tower of London, by claiming George will murder Edward&#x27;s heirs. He then tells George he will help him get out. Having confused and deceived the King, Richard proceeds with his plans after getting a warrant, and enlists two ruffians (Michael Gough and Michael Ripper) to carry out his dirty work: George is murdered, drowned in a butt of wine. Though Edward had sent a pardon to Richard, Richard stopped it passing. Richard goes on to woo and seduce the Lady Anne (Claire Bloom), and though she hates him for killing her husband and father, she cannot resist Richard&#x27;s charms and ends up marrying him.

Richard then orchestrates disorder at court, fueling rivalries and stirring antipathy toward the Queen consort, Elizabeth (Mary Kerridge). The King, weakened by exhaustion, appoints Richard as Lord Protector and dies soon after hearing of the death of George. His son, soon to become Edward V (Paul Huson), is met by Richard whilst en route to London. Richard has the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Hastings (Alec Clunes) arrested and executed, and forces the young King, along with his younger brother the Duke of York (Andy Shine), to have a protracted stay at the Tower of London. 
With all obstacles now removed, Richard enlists the help of his cousin the Duke of Buckingham (Sir Ralph Richardson) to alter his public image, and to become popular with the people. In doing so, Richard becomes the people&#x27;s first choice to become the new King. Buckingham had aided Richard on terms of being given the title of Earl of Hereford and its income, but balks at the idea of murdering the two princes. Richard then asks an ambitious knight, Sir James Tyrrel (Patrick Troughton), to kill the princes. Buckingham, having requested his earldom at Richard&#x27;s coronation, fears for his life when Richard (angry at Buckingham&#x27;s refusal) shouts, &quot;I am not in the giving vein today!&quot; Buckingham then joins the opposition against Richard&#x27;s rule.

Richard, now fearful because of his dwindling popularity, raises an army to defend his throne and the House of York against the House of Lancaster, led by Henry Tudor (Stanley Baker), the Earl of Richmond and later Henry VII of England, at Bosworth Field. Before the battle, however, Buckingham is captured and executed. On the eve of the battle, Richard is haunted by the ghosts of all those he has killed in his bloody ascent to the throne, and he wakes up screaming. He composes himself, striding out to plan the battle for his generals, and gives a motivational speech to his troops.

The two forces engage in battle, with the Lancastrians having the upper hand. Lord Stanley (Laurence Naismith) betrays Richard and allies himself with Henry. Richard sees this and charges into the thick of battle, side by side with his loyal companion Sir William Catesby (Norman Wooland) to kill Richmond and end the battle quickly. Eventually, Richard spots Richmond and they briefly engage in a duel before being interrupted by Stanley&#x27;s men. Richard and Catesby are able to escape the oncoming forces but, in doing so, Richard is knocked off his horse, loses his cherished crown, and becomes separated from Catesby, who is off seeking rescue. Searching desperately for Richmond, whom he has lost sight of, Richard cries out: &quot;A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!&quot; 

Catesby finds Richard and offers him withdrawal, but the King refuses to flee. Catesby is then killed by Richmond&#x27;s men without Richard noticing. Richard then spots Stanley and engages him in single combat. Before a victor can emerge, the Lancastrian troops charge Richard and fatally wound him. The wounded murderous King convulses in spasms, offering his sword to the sky, and eventually dies of his wounds. Stanley orders Richard&#x27;s body to be taken away and then finds his crown in a thorn bush. He then proceeds to offer it to Henry, leaving the throne of England in safe hands once again.

==Cast==
Olivier cast only British actors. Since the film was financed by Alexander Korda and produced by his London Films, obtaining the required actors was not difficult, as many actors were contractually obliged to London Films. As with most films with ensemble casts, all the players were billed on the same tier. However, Olivier played the title character and occupies the majority of screen time.

When casting the supporting roles, Olivier chose to fortify the already impressive cast with seasoned veterans, such as Laurence Naismith, and with promising newcomers, such as Claire Bloom and Stanley Baker. For the murderers, Olivier originally wanted John Mills and Richard Attenborough. However, Mills thought the idea might be regarded as &quot;stunt casting&quot;, and Attenborough had to turn down the part due to a scheduling conflict. The film&#x27;s marketers in the US picked up on the fact that the cast included four knights (Olivier, Richardson, Gielgud and Hardwicke) and used this as a selling point. The four members of the cast who had already achieved British knighthood were all listed as &quot;Sir...&quot; in the film credits.

===The House of York===
* Sir Laurence Olivier as Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), the malformed brother of the King, who is jealous of his brother&#x27;s new power, and plans to take it for himself. Olivier had created his interpretation of the Crookback King in 1944, and this film transferred that portrayal to the screen. This portrayal earned Olivier his fifth Oscar nomination, and is generally considered to be one of his greatest performances; some consider it his best performance in a Shakespeare play.
* Sir Cedric Hardwicke as King Edward IV of England, the newly crowned King of England, who, with the aid of his brother, Richard, has secured his position by wresting it from Henry VI of the House of Lancaster. This marked his only appearance in a film version of a Shakespeare play. He was 62 at the time of the film, whereas Edward died at the age of 40.
* Sir John Gielgud as George, Duke of Clarence, brother of Richard and of the new King. Gielgud&#x27;s casting in this film can be seen as part of Olivier&#x27;s quest for an all-star cast.
* Sir Ralph Richardson as the Duke of Buckingham, a corrupt magnate of the realm and a cousin of Edward IV and Richard of Gloucester, who sees potential for advancement in Richard&#x27;s plans and eventually turns against him when Richard ignores his wishes. Richardson was a lifelong friend of Olivier&#x27;s. Olivier later regretted this choice, and wrote that Orson Welles would have been better in the part.
* Paul Huson as Edward, Prince of Wales (later, for a brief while, King Edward V), the eldest son of the King, who holds many strong beliefs, and wishes one day to become a warrior king.
* Andy Shine as the Duke of York, the younger son of Prince Edward.
* Helen Haye as the Duchess of York, the mother of the King. Haye worked regularly for Alexander Korda. Her character&#x27;s role is severely cut in the film from the play.
* Pamela Brown as Mistress Shore, the King&#x27;s mistress. Her character is only mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, never seen.
* Alec Clunes as The Lord Hastings (Lord Chamberlain), a companion and friend of Richard who is accused of conspiracy by Richard and is abruptly executed.
* Laurence Naismith as The Lord Stanley. Stanley has a certain dislike for Richard and is not totally willing in his co-operation with him. Stanley eventually betrays Richard at Bosworth and engages him in a one-on-one duel.
* Norman Wooland as Sir William Catesby, Esmond Knight as Sir Richard Ratcliffe, John Laurie as Lord Francis Lovell, Patrick Troughton as Sir James Tyrrell, and John Phillips as John, Duke of Norfolk, many of them loyal companions of Richard.

===The House of Lancaster===
* Mary Kerridge as Queen Elizabeth, Queen Consort of Edward. Kerridge did not make many screen appearances, though she did sometimes work for Alexander Korda. Her role has also been reduced from Shakespeare&#x27;s original.
* Clive Morton as The Lord Rivers, brother of the Queen Consort. Morton was a British actor who mainly played supporting roles on screen.
* Dan Cunningham as The Lord Grey, youngest son of the Queen Consort and stepson of the King. Cunningham&#x27;s role in Richard III was one of his few screen appearances.
* Douglas Wilmer as the Marquess of Dorset, eldest son of the Queen Consort and stepson of the King.
* Claire Bloom as The Lady Anne, a widow and an orphan thanks to the acts of Richard, though she cannot resist his charms and eventually becomes his wife.
* Stanley Baker, appropriately cast as the young Welshman, Henry, Earl of Richmond (later Henry VII, first of the House of Tudor). Henry, who is Richard&#x27;s enemy, and Lord Stanley&#x27;s stepson, claims his right to the throne, and briefly duels Richard at Bosworth.

==Production==

===Background===
Of Olivier&#x27;s three Shakespeare films, &quot;Richard III&quot; had the longest gestation period: Olivier had created and been developing his vision of the character Richard since his portrayal for The Old Vic in 1944. After he had made Shakespeare films popular with &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the choice of &quot;Richard III&quot; for his next adaptation was simple, as his Richard had been widely praised on stage. For the stage production, Olivier had modelled some of the crookback king&#x27;s look on a well-known theatrical producer at the time, Jed Harris, whom Olivier called &quot;the most loathsome man I&#x27;d ever met&quot;. Walt Disney is also said to have used Harris as his basis for the Big Bad Wolf in the film &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;. Alexander Korda, who had given Olivier his initial roles on film, provided financial support for the film.

===Screenplay===
Most of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but Olivier also drew on the 18th century adaptations by Colley Cibber and David Garrick, including Cibber&#x27;s line, &quot;Off with his head. So much for Buckingham!&quot;. Like Cibber and Garrick, Olivier&#x27;s film opens with material from the last scenes of &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, to introduce more clearly the situation at the beginning of the story.

A key change in the story involved the seduction of Anne. It is split into two scenes instead of one, and an element of perversity is added—whereas in the original play she is following a coffin with the corpse of her father-in-law, in this film the coffin contains the corpse of her husband. John Cottrell has been quoted as saying this makes &quot;the young widow&#x27;s seduction even more daring and revolting than it is in the original, and [gives] Anne&#x27;s capitulation&quot; in the second part after a passionate kiss &quot;a new and neurotic twist&quot;. This is accomplished by cutting lines, changing lines, and changing the sequence of some lines.

Olivier makes other small and subtle additions in the stage direction. When Richard&#x27;s nephew makes a joke about his uncle&#x27;s hunchback (&quot;you should bear me on your shoulder&quot;), Richard spins round and gives the boy a malevolent glare making the boy stagger back. This bit of stage direction is original to Olivier. Olivier also silently mimes some actions spoken of in his soliloquies such as when he whispers insinuations about Clarence into the ear of King Edward.

In general the lengthy play is heavily cut. In an interview with Roger Manvell, Olivier discussed how unwieldy and complex the play is:

The character of Queen Margaret is cut entirely, the role of the Duchess of York (Helen Haye) is significantly reduced, the role of Edward IV&#x27;s wife Elizabeth is also reduced, and the execution of Clarence and other scenes are abridged. These cuts were made to maintain the pace of the film and to cut down the running time, as a full performance of the play can run upwards of four hours. Richard is made more directly responsible for the death of Edward IV than in the play, as Edward has his fatal attack only moments after Richard informs the assembled nobles that Clarence is dead.

===Filming===
Gerry O&#x27;Hara was Olivier&#x27;s assistant director, on hand to help since Olivier was acting in most of the scenes.

Olivier was very precise in getting many of the visual details of the period correct. Actor Douglas Wilmer (Dorset) recounts that when he casually told Olivier that one piece of heraldry on the set was incorrect, Olivier started pumping as much information out of him as possible as if he was &quot;drilling for oil&quot;.

Olivier made the unusual decision to deliver his soliloquies by directly addressing the film audience, something not often done before in film. Near the beginning of the film Richard&#x27;s herald drops his coronet, a mistake that Olivier decided to keep in, as part of the motif of accidental loss of the crown continued in the final battle.

Most of the film was shot at Shepperton Studios, but the climactic Battle of Bosworth Field abruptly opens up the setting, as it was shot outdoors, in the Spanish countryside. During one sequence therein, Olivier suffered an arrow wound to the shin when his horse jerked forwards causing the expert archer to miss. Fortunately, it was on the leg Richard was supposed to limp on, allowing the scene to continue.

Wilmer also notes: 

During filming, Olivier&#x27;s portrait was painted by Salvador Dalí. The painting remained one of Olivier&#x27;s favourites until he had to sell it to pay for his children&#x27;s school fees.

===Cinematography===
The cinematography for the film was by Otto Heller, who had worked on many European films before coming to the UK in the early 1940s. The film uses the Technicolor process, which Olivier had earlier rejected for his &quot;Hamlet&quot; after a row with the company. The use of Technicolor resulted in bright, vibrant colours. Korda had suggested that Olivier also use the new extreme widescreen format, CinemaScope, but Olivier thought it was nothing more than a gimmick, and chose the less extreme VistaVision format instead.

===Music===
The score was composed by Sir William Walton, who worked on all of the films Olivier directed except &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;. The music was conducted by Muir Mathieson, who collaborated on all of the films Olivier directed, except for &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. The film&#x27;s music was also used for a set of readings of speeches from the play on audio CD featuring John Gielgud. The Chandos catalogue notes that Walton used the main theme throughout the film, especially towards the closing scenes.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Richard III&quot; opened at the Leicester Square Theatre on 13 December 1955, with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip attending the premiere. Alexander Korda had sold the rights to the film to NBC in the US for $500,000 (about $ in today&#x27;s dollars) and the film was shown on Sunday, 11 March 1956. While many sources refer to the &quot;simultaneous release&quot; in the US of &quot;Richard III&quot; on television and at the cinema, it was in fact shown first on television. It was not shown during prime time, but rather at 2:30p.m. in the afternoon, so prime time ratings for that day were not affected by any pre-emptions for a special programme. It was the first 3-hour telecast of a film ever in the US and the first time that a film in the US had premiered on two media on the same day. It had its US theatrical premiere at 8:30p.m. at the Bijou Theatre in Manhattan.

The film, although slightly cut for television, was generally well received by critics, with Olivier&#x27;s performance earning particular notice, but as a result of its simultaneous release through television and cinemas in the US, it was a box office failure, and many critics felt at the time that it was not as well-made as Olivier&#x27;s previous films. However, the airing on US television received excellent ratings, with an audience estimated at between 25 and 40 million. The film&#x27;s failure at the US box office effectively ended Olivier&#x27;s career as a director of Shakespearean films. His proposed film of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which had been intended to go into production during 1957, in the end finally failed to gain financing.

When the film was reissued in 1966, it broke box office records in many US cities. Its critical reputation has since grown considerably, and many critics now consider it Olivier&#x27;s best and most influential screen adaptation of Shakespeare.
===Accolades=== 
In contrast to his previous work, Olivier was only nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor (his fifth nomination in the category). The award went to Yul Brynner for his performance in &quot;The King and I&quot;.

* Olivier&#x27;s performance as Richard III was ranked 39th in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;

==Reputation==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an 81% rating based on 21 reviews. However, Olivier&#x27;s direction has been criticised for being far more restricted in its style in comparison to the bold filming of &quot;Henry V&quot;, or the moody photography of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and the reviewer for the &quot;AllMovie&quot; website complained that Olivier too far outshone the supporting cast. There were some complaints about geographical inaccuracies in the film. For example, the Battle of Bosworth Field was filmed in a region of Spain that does not resemble any locations in England. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Olivier observed that the film makes Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London &quot;practically adjacent&quot;, but adds that &quot;if they weren&#x27;t like that, they should have been&quot;.

The British Film Institute suggests Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; may have done more to popularise Shakespeare than any other piece of work. According to them, the 25–40 million viewers during its airing on US television, &quot;would have outnumbered the sum of the play&#x27;s theatrical audiences over the 358 years since its first performance.&quot;

==Home media==
A three-disc vinyl box set of the soundtrack was issued shortly after the film was released.

The film has since been released on VHS numerous times, but these releases are made from cropped low quality sources. Carlton Entertainment released the first DVD in 2000 presented in a widescreen ratio. This release was presented in 1.78:1 but is non-anamorphic and zoomed in the most compared to the later releases. In 2002, Wienerworld released a special edition DVD with a new 1.66:1 widescreen transfer, a trailer, and star bios. In 2004, Criterion digitally restored the film in its original 1.66:1 widescreen format and re-constructed it to match the release script. Unlike the previous releases before it that were made from different and inferior source elements, Criterion performed their own restoration and digital transfer. It was released in a 2-disc special edition, including an essay by film and music historian Bruce Eder, an interview with Olivier, and other numerous special features. The DVD is subtitled in English, with a Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio track. The DVD also contains a commentary by Russell Lees and John Wilders. The second disc of the DVD features a 1966 BBC interview with Olivier by Kenneth Tynan entitled &quot;Great Acting: Laurence Olivier&quot;. It also contains a gallery of posters, production stills and two trailers.
The film was given a Blu-ray release in the UK by Network, and later in 2012 by The Criterion Collection for DVD and Blu-ray in the United States. Both releases featured a restoration from the original film elements by the Film Foundation in conjunction with ITV Global, owners of the London Films/Rank library.

<text>Ballinamallard United Football Club is a semi-professional Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Championship. The club, re-formed in 1975 after being dormant since the 1960s, hails from Ballinamallard, near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, and plays its home matches at Ferney Park. Club colours are all royal blue (home), and all white (away).

==History==
During 2008–09 and the first part of 2009–10, the club played at Holm Park, the home of Armagh City, while Ferney Park was brought up to Championship standard. The club&#x27;s first match back at its own ground was on 5 December 2009 in its first ever major cup quarter final against Portadown in the League Cup.

In February 2011 the club reached its first ever Irish Cup quarter final when it defeated Lisburn Distillery 4–2 after a 6th Round replay at Ferney Park.

On 31 March 2012, the club secured promotion to the top flight of Northern Irish football for the first time in their history. A 3–2 win over Bangor secured the 2011–12 IFA Championship 1 title, and promotion to the 2012–13 IFA Premiership. They became the first team from County Fermanagh to play senior football.

In their first season in the Premiership the target was to avoid relegation. However, they surpassed all expectations, finishing 5th in the table. They secured a 2–2 draw at Ferney Park in their opening Premiership fixture against Dungannon Swifts, and their stand out results during the season included a 1–0 away win over eventual league champions Cliftonville at Solitude in September 2012. They also defeated reigning champions Linfield twice at Windsor Park, 3–1 in October 2012 and 1–0 in the post-split match in April 2013.

In their second season 2013–14 they finished in 10th place, three points above Warrenpoint Town in the play-off place after going unbeaten in their last 6 games of the season. No play-off was ultimately needed that season.

In their third season 2014–15 they finished in 9th place, 2 points above Dungannon Swifts in 10th and 9 points above Warrenpoint Town in the play-off place. The club also made history by reaching its first ever major cup semi final when it beat Glentoran in a penalty shootout in a Wasp Solutions League Cup quarter final at Ferney Park.

In the 2015–16 season the Mallard&#x27;s recorded their first ever win at The Oval beating Glentoran 0–2 and they also recorded their first ever win at Shamrock Park and The Ballymena Showgrounds winning 3–0 and 2–1 respectively. The Mallard&#x27;s Irish Cup campaign was a disappointing one going out in the 5th Round on penalties to Coleraine after surrendering a two-goal lead in the second half. They reached the Quarter-Finals of the League Cup before being knocked out by eventual finalists Ards in another penalty shoot out. The Mallard&#x27;s contested a thrilling end to the season with Carrick Rangers and Warrenpoint Town with Ballinamallard beating Carrick 1–0 on the final day and Warrenpoint beating Dungannon Swifts 1–0 meaning Carrick would automatically return to NIFL Championship 1 and Warrenpoint Town would contest the promotion/relegation play-off and the Fermanagh side would be safe.

However, in the 89th minute at Taylor&#x27;s Avenue Carrick Rangers equalized through Mark Surgenor meaning that Carrick would still be automatically relegated to the NIFL Championship 1 but that Ballinamallard would now contest the play-off and Warrenpoint Town would be safe in 10th place. The drama took yet another turn when in the 94th minute of the game at Taylor&#x27;s Avenue in the final minute of stoppage time, Miguel Chines scored a stunning bicycle kick to win the game for Carrick Rangers meaning in fact that they would be safe prompting wild celebrations from the Carrick supporters meaning now that Ballinamallard would be automatically relegated to Championship 1 and Warrenpoint would contest the play-off. In the final turn, Warrenpoint Town conceded a controversial penalty in the dying seconds of their game with Andrew Mitchell putting it away to make it 1–1 now automatically relegating Warrenpoint Town and Ballinamallard United contesting the play-off with Institute where they managed to beat the Drumahoe side 2–1 away from home and drew 3–3 at Ferney Park to secure the club&#x27;s premier league status for the 2016–17 season. On 13 May 2016 it was announced legendary manager, Whitey Anderson, would be leaving the club after over ten years service. Finn Harps assistant coach Gavin Dykes was appointed as his replacement. The Mallards went on to secure 10th place to guarantee their 6th season in the NIFL Premiership.

On 30 March 2019 Ballinamallard United reached their first ever Irish Cup final by beating Warrenpoint Town in a penalty shoot-out. Striker Ryan Campbell scored the winning penalty.
In the final on 4 May, they lost 3–0 to Crusaders.

In November 2023, the club appointed former Dergview boss Tommy Canning following the departure of Harry McConkey, who had managed the club since March 2018. 
Canning would depart the club at the end of the season, citing work commitments and travel for the reason behind his resignation. 
 Mark Stafford, having served under Canning as assistant manager, was named as his successor.

<doc id="1345786" wikidata="Q2331674" url="?curid=1345786" title="Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)">
<text>&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released as the second track on their fourth studio album in 1971. The song contains a guest performance by original Rolling Stones&#x27; pianist and co-founder Ian Stewart. 

== Composition ==
The song is performed in the key of A at a relatively fast tempo of 170 beats per minute. The main guitar riff performed by Jimmy Page has been described as &quot;simple but incredibly effective&quot; which &quot;[leaves] space for Jones, and especially, the powerhouse drumming of Bonham to drive things along.&quot; The opening riff is double-tracked in stereo audio. A third, more distorted guitar track is panned to the center, contrasting Page&#x27;s main guitar tracks with counter-chords. A fourth guitar track adds &quot;rock &amp; roll licks.&quot; The song also utilizes piano tracks performed by Ian Stewart. 

==Background and recording==
According to guitarist Jimmy Page, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; developed from a spontaneous jam session that occurred after the band became frustrated while attempting to finish recording &quot;Four Sticks&quot; at the Headley Grange mansion they had rented in Hampshire, England. During a break, John Bonham began playing the drum intro to the 1957 song &quot;Keep A-Knockin&#x27;&quot; by Little Richard, to which Page added a Chuck Berry-style guitar riff. The rest of the band members reportedly joined in &quot;one by one.&quot; Ian Stewart was also present at the session performing piano. Realizing the potential in the new idea, the band immediately put &quot;Four Sticks&quot; on the &quot;back burner.&quot; The tapes were rolling, and after improvising the first section of the song, the basis of the rest of the song was completed in around fifteen minutes. 

==Reception==
In 1972, American music critic and journalist Robert Christgau called it &quot;simply the most dynamic hard-rock song in the music.&quot;&quot; Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;rip-apart performance of one of best r&amp;r revivalist tunes ever.&quot; In 2019, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number 9 on its list of the 40 greatest Led Zeppelin songs.

==Live performance==
&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; was a key component of the band&#x27;s setlist at Led Zeppelin concerts from 1971 on. Initially, Plant referred to it on stage as &quot;It&#x27;s Been A Long Time&quot;, which is the opening lyric line of the song. In 1972, it was elevated to the opening number of all concert performances and it retained this status until 1975. For the band&#x27;s 1977 North American tour, it became part of a medley encore with &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, and during 1979 and 1980 it became an encore in its own right.

Plant&#x27;s vocal melodies on the track were so high that he often had to alter the melodies during live performances that he could manage more easily.

==Cadillac advertising==
In 2001, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; became the first Led Zeppelin song to be licensed for commercial use, when American car maker Cadillac featured it in television advertising. Plant commented:

As well as earning Led Zeppelin a large licensing fee, the advertising campaign increased Cadillac sales by 16 percent in 2002.

<text>The Stationery Office (TSO) is a British publishing company created in 1996 when the publishing arm of Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office was privatised. It is the official publisher and the distributor for legislation, command and house papers, select committee reports, &quot;Hansard&quot;, and the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes, the UK government&#x27;s three official journals of record. With more than 9,000 titles in print and digital formats published every year, it is one of the UK&#x27;s largest publishers by volume.

TSO provides services, consultancy, and infrastructure to deliver all aspects of the information lifecycle. TSO developed the website legislation.gov.uk with The National Archives, providing full access to the statute book as open data.

The TSO OpenUp platform is a collection of integrated services available as software as a service (SaaS), with the aim of providing a scalable and resilient platform that allows organisations to store, query, and enrich their data.

==History==
The Stationery Office was sold for £54 million when it was privatised in 1996. Two thirds of TSO was purchased by Electra Fleming, an investment trust co-owned by Electra Investment and the investment bank Robert Fleming &amp; Company. Three executives of TSO purchased large stakes in the business: Rupert Pennant-Rea purchased a 4.5 per cent stake, Bob Thian a 6 per cent stake, and Richard Martin 3 per cent stake.

In 1999, Electra Fleming sold TSO to its existing management team and Apax, a private equity firm, for £82 million. Rupert Pennant-Rea remained as chairman, and Fred Perkins stayed as chief executive. TSO was sold in 2006 to business process outsourcing company Williams Lea, of which a majority stake had been acquired by logistics company Deutsche Post earlier that year.

In 2014, TSO also began working with the local government sector, beginning with the redevelopment of the Croydon Council internal and external websites.

<doc id="1345789" wikidata="Q197440" url="?curid=1345789" title="Zhao Hongbo">
<text>Zhao Hongbo (; born 22 September 1973) is a Chinese retired pair skater. With his wife Shen Xue, Zhao is the 2010 Olympic champion, the 2002 &amp; 2006 Olympic bronze medalist, a three-time World champion (2002, 2003 &amp; 2007), a three-time Four Continents Champion (1999, 2003 &amp; 2007) and a six-time Grand Prix Final champion (1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2006 &amp; 2009).

Shen and Zhao were the first Chinese pair team to win a medal at an International Skating Union event and at the World Figure Skating Championships, in 1999. In 2002, they became the first Chinese pair skating team to win a World Championship. They are also the first Chinese pair skaters to win a medal at the Winter Olympic Games. In 2010, they were the first Chinese skaters to win the gold medal at the Winter Olympic Games in any figure skating category, ending almost half a century of Russian and Soviet pair skating dominance.

==Personal life==
Zhao was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang and is of Manchurian ethnicity. Shen and Zhao announced their engagement after the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. They were married shortly after.

Shen and Zhao are the parents of a daughter, born 3 September 2013.

They currently live and coach in Shenzhen, Guangdong.

== Career ==

=== Early career and development ===
Early in his career, Zhao skated with partner Xie Maomao. They placed 11th at the 1991 World Junior Figure Skating Championships.

He began skating with Shen Xue in 1992, under the tutelage of Yao Bin. They competed at their first Olympics in 1998, in Nagano, Japan and finished fifth. They went on to the 1999 World Figure Skating Championships a year later with improved choreography and expression, and won the silver medal, becoming the first Chinese team to ever win a World Championship medal.

=== International Success ===
Shen and Zhao improved each year, and were considered to be one of the top teams in the world. They won another silver medal at the Worlds in 2000, and a bronze in 2001. They were considered strong medal contenders in the 2002 Winter Olympics. They won the bronze with a strong performance, missing a throw quadruple salchow attempt. They became the first Chinese pair to win a medal at the Olympics for figure skating.

===World Champions===
At the 2002 World Figure Skating Championships held in Nagano, Japan, Shen and Zhao won their first World Championship, becoming the first Chinese pair skaters to win a gold medal in the history of figure skating. Later in March 2003, as the defending world champions, the team also won their second World Championship in Washington D.C., United States. While practising their throw quadruple salchow, Shen landed badly and severely injured her landing foot and ankle. She required several treatments to numb the foot entirely so that she should compete. The pair performed a brilliant long program that earned them several perfect 6.0&#x27;s for both technical merits and presentation.

In the 2003–2004 season, competing for the first time under the Code of Points, they placed second at the 2003 Skate Canada and won the 2003 Cup of China. They won their third Grand Prix Final gold medal at the 2003–2004 Grand prix Final, where they won both the short program with 66.00 points and the free skate with 130.08. The team earned a total of 196.08 points to finish 18.78 points ahead of their new rivals Tatiana Totmianina &amp; Maxim Marinin of Russia, who were second in both the short and the long program.

Their attempt to win a third straight World title in 2004 was thwarted when Zhao fell during their short program and the team placed fourth in that segment. They rebounded to win the free program with a string of 6.0s, but it was only good enough for second overall behind Tatiana Totmianina &amp; Maxim Marinin.

===Injury and 2006 Olympics===
Shen and Zhao won gold medals at the 2004 Skate Canada, at the 2004 Trophée Eric Bompard and at the 2004 Cup of China. Following their wins at all their Grand Prix events, they also won the 2004–2005 Grand Prix Final in Beijing, China, placing first in the short program with 70.52 points and in the free skate scoring 136.02. Overall they won the gold medal earning a total of 206.54 points, 19.22 ahead of Maria Petrova &amp; Alexei Tikhonov, who placed second in both segments of the competition. As a result, they set a new world record for the short program, for the free skate and for the combined total score under the ISU Judging System.

In 2005 Zhao&#x27;s Achilles tendon injury forced them to withdraw from the World Championships, and weeks later, he ruptured the tendon during practice. They missed the entire competitive season and were unable to return to the ice until weeks before the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. They placed fifth in the short program with 62.32 points and third in the free skate with 124.59. Their lack of adequate preparation was obvious, but they managed to win a second Olympic bronze medal earning 186.91 points, 17.57 points behind Tatiana Totmianina &amp; Maxim Marinin, who won the gold medal.

===Third World title and retirement===
The 2006–2007 proved to be a very strong season for the pair. They began winning the 2006 Cup of China, where they came in first place in the short program and in the free skate to win the competition with a total score of 193.59 points, 21.03 ahead of Zhang Dan &amp; Zhang Hao. They also won the 2006 NHK Trophy, where they also placed first in both the short program and the free skate earning 190.97 points, beating Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian by 8.13.

They earned the gold medal at the 2006–2007 Grand Prix Final, held in Saint Petersburg, Russia. At that competition, they won the short program scoring 68.66 points, 4.48 points ahead of Zhang Dan &amp; Zhang Hao. The team also placed first in the free skate with 134.53 points, 12.68 ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy from Germany. They earned a total of 203.19 points to finish 22.52 points ahead of second-place finishers Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy.

At the 2007 Asian Winter Games, where they won the short program with 69.49 points, leading by 3.84 over the rest of the field. They placed first in free skate scoring 126.06 points, winning that segment as well by 10.24 points. They earned 195.55 points overall, edging their teammates Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian by 14.08 points, who placed second in both the short program and the free skate.

Some weeks later, they won the 2007 Four Continents Championships, placing first in the short program with 69.29 points, 3.49 ahead of the rest of the competitors. They also won the free skate earning 133.76 points, leading that segment of the competition by 14.23 points. As a result, they scored a combined total of 203.05 points to win the competition 17.72 points ahead of Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian, who again came in second place in the short and in the long program.

They also won the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships in Tokyo, Japan, placing first in the short program with 71.07 points, taking the lead by 3.42 points ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy, and setting a new world record under the ISU Judging System. They also won the free skate with 132.43 points, 10.72 ahead of Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian, who placed second in that segment of the competition. Overall they scored a total 203.50 points and won by a 15.04-point margin of victory over silver medalists Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian. As a result, on 21 March 2007, they won their third World Championship title. Following the win, they married and announced their retirement from the sport.

===Return to competition===
They returned to competition in the 2009–2010 season to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics, and were assigned to 2009 Cup of China and 2009 Skate America in the 2009–2010 ISU Grand Prix series.

At the 2009 Cup of China, they placed first in the short program earning a personal best score of 72.28. They also won the free skate scoring 128.69 to win the competition with 200.97 points, 14.18 points ahead of silver medalists Zhang Dan &amp; Zhang Hao. At the 2009 Skate America, they placed first in the short program with a new personal best of 74.36 points. They also lead in the free skate where they earned 127.04 points. Scoring 201.40 points overall, 29.58 points over Tatiana Volosozhar &amp; Stanislav Morozov, they won the gold medal.

Those two wins directly qualified them for the 2009–2010 Grand Prix Final that was held in Tokyo, Japan, in December 2009. At the event, they lead the short program with a new personal best of 75.36 points, 2.22 points ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy, who were second. They also placed first in the free skate with another personal best of 138.89 points, 5.07 ahead of fellow second-place finishers Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian. They won the gold medal earning 214.25 points overall, edging silver medalists Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian by 12.39 points and improving their previous combined total score. At the competition, they set new world records for the short program, for the free skating and for the combined total under the ISU Judging System.

===2010 Olympics===
On 14 February 2010, they competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics. They led the short program with 76.66 points, 0.70 ahead of Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy. They achieved a new personal best and set a new record score again under the ISU Judging System for the short program.

On 15 February 2010, in the pairs&#x27; free skating they came second with a new personal best score of 139.91 points, 1.90 behind Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian, who claimed the silver medal. Their program components score of 72.40 was the highest of the event. They also got a 10.00 for interpretation from one judge. With an overall total of 216.57 points they finished in first place taking the gold medal, by a 3.26 margin on Pang Qing &amp; Tong Jian and a 5.77 margin on bronze medalists Aliona Savchenko &amp; Robin Szolkowy. Their combined score was also a world record. At 31 and 36 years old respectively, they were among the oldest Olympic champions in figure skating. They became the first Chinese skaters in any figure skating discipline to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympic Games.

China at the event also broke Russia&#x27;s 46-year twelve-Olympic gold medal streak in pairs figure skating, sweeping gold and silver places.

=== Final retirement ===

On 17 February 2010, they announced their definite retirement from competitive skating to focus on their personal life. They said they would retire from shows in 2012, planning to start a family, promote their sport, and begin coaching.

<doc id="1345791" wikidata="Q2862635" url="?curid=1345791" title="Caesar and Me">
<text>&quot;Caesar and Me&quot; is episode 148 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; starring Jackie Cooper as a ventriloquist. It is not to be confused with a similar episode &quot;The Dummy&quot;, starring Cliff Robertson as a ventriloquist.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Jonathan West is an unsuccessful Irish ventriloquist. He is perpetually broke, selling valuable keepsakes like his grandfather&#x27;s watch to pawnbrokers in exchange for petty cash. At the boarding house where he lives, he is mercilessly taunted by a little girl, Susan, for failing to find a job. But unbeknownst to everyone, Jonathan&#x27;s evil ventriloquist dummy, &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, has a mind of his own and talks to him at will. Despite Jonathan&#x27;s reassurances that they are on the verge of a big break, Caesar apathetically tells him that they have hit bottom.

When Jonathan and Caesar go to a nightclub for an audition, the performance is poorly received. The following day, Jonathan is unable to find employment because of his lack of vocational experience and his immigrant status; he may soon leave the boarding house because he is behind on his rent. Caesar berates Jonathan for being a hopeless &quot;&quot;, but has a solution to his money woes: burglary. A reluctant Jonathan—directed by Caesar in his suitcase—breaks into a delicatessen and steals its money. Jonathan uses it to pay his rent, but Caesar, during a conversation overheard by Susan, pressures him into committing more burglaries.

Susan—now aware that Caesar can talk—sneaks into Jonathan&#x27;s room in his absence to unsuccessfully speak with the dummy. Jonathan catches her coming out of the room and runs her off. Inside, Jonathan expresses a desire to flee, but Caesar cajoles him into carrying out the next burglary. The duo sneaks into the nightclub to break into the manager&#x27;s office. However, they are caught by a night watchman after they steal money from the nightclub&#x27;s safe. They manage to bluff their way past him by giving an impromptu routine.

When Jonathan and Caesar arrive home, Susan eavesdrops on their ensuing argument. The next morning over breakfast, Susan hears her aunt, Mrs. Cudahy, read about the nightclub theft from a newspaper. She calls the police to tip them off about Jonathan and Caesar. Two detectives arrive at the boarding house and interrogate Jonathan, who tries to make Caesar talk about his role in the crime. The dummy, however, remains silent. Mrs. Cudahy and the detectives stare at the one-sided exchange, thinking Jonathan mad. Jonathan now realizes that Caesar has abandoned him and is willingly arrested.

After the detectives lead Jonathan out of the room, Caesar turns his head around and addresses Susan, who lingered and is the last to leave. She triumphantly tells him she knew all the time he could speak. He says he likes her for her &quot;hip attitude&quot; and offers to help her run away to New York City. Caesar assures Susan that Jonathan will now be gone &quot;a long, long time&quot; and that the two of them are now &quot;a team&quot;. Finally, Caesar hints Susan should kill her aunt with poison darts. She says nothing and smiles.

==Production notes==
The writer of the episode, Adele Strassfield, was the secretary of William Froug, the producer of the second half of the final season of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. According to Froug, they worked out this episode together. Strassfield is billed in the credits as &quot;Adele T. Strassfield&quot;, &quot;not&quot; &quot;A.T. Strassfield&quot; as Zicree inexplicably avers in &quot;The Twilight Zone Companion&quot;; Serling also announced her as &quot;Adele T. Strassfield&quot; in a promotional announcement for the episode that aired the previous week. Strassfield is the only woman credited with writing an original teleplay for the original version of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, though several women received credit for stories that were adapted for the show. She later wrote a first-season episode of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; with executive producer Froug&#x27;s assistance.

The dummy used in this episode to portray &quot;Caesar&quot; was originally created in the 1940s by puppet maker Revello Petee. The same dummy was used one year earlier in the 1962 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, &quot;The Dummy&quot;. A figure of the puppet can be seen at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in the dark corner of a barred-off exhibit to the side of one of the elevator exits of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ride.

<text>Assemblies of God youth organizations include two youth organizations operating under the auspices of the Assemblies of God, the Royal Rangers and the Mpact Girls Clubs (formerly known as the Missionettes).


==Royal Rangers==
Royal Rangers is an adventure-based, merit-driven, faith-based, church ministry and mentoring program for boys in grades K-12, providing “Christlike character formation and servant leadership development for boys and young men in a highly relational and fun environment&quot;. The Royal Rangers program is active throughout the United States as well as in over 90 other nations; consequently, in 2002, &#x27;Royal Rangers International&#x27; (RRI) was started. Royal Rangers in the USA is a boys-only program, unless the church does not have a girls ministry program; programs in some other nations allow both boys and girls to participate. The uniforms, mottos, practices and operation are derived from the Boy Scouts.

Royal Rangers&#x27; Mission is to &quot;evangelize, equip, and empower the next generation of Christlike men and lifelong servant leaders.&quot;
(Formerly worded: To instruct, challenge, and inspire our boys in the areas of Bible doctrine, Christian service, moral conduct, and the basic beliefs of our church, through interesting activities that boys enjoy.) They also position themselves against the LGBT-Community and forbid members of that community to be a group leader, stating on their website: &quot;This prohibition encompasses [...] homosexual conduct, as well as the practice of transgender or altered gender identity.&quot;

The highest attainable award in Royal Rangers is the Gold Medal of Achievement (GMA), which is promoted as the equivalent to the rank of Eagle Scout. The GMA testifies to the persevering work, assiduous endurance, and ceaseless dedication towards the program, plus being equipped to be strong, intrepid leaders.

*Discovery Rangers (3rd grade to 5th grade)
*Adventure Rangers (6th grade to 8th grade)
*Expedition Rangers (High School (i.e. 9th-12th grade)) 

===Special programs===
The program features a number of components of special interest to certain types of our membership. These include: Frontiersman Camping Fellowship (FCF), Royal Rangers Alumni, The Outpost Ranger of the Year, The NSSP (National Shooting Sports Program), The National Championships, Brownells/NRA National Youth Shooting Sports Program, and the &quot;Together Plan&quot;.

===Royal Rangers International===
Royal Rangers ministers to young people in the United States and in over 90 countries through the support of Royal Rangers International, the Assemblies of God World Missions organization tasked with the responsibility to support Royal Rangers worldwide (see RoyalRangersInternational.com). Thus, in 2002, &quot;Royal Rangers International&quot; was created. The largest organization outside the United States is in Australia, with groups in all areas except Northern Territory and Western Australia.

==Mpact Girls Clubs==
Mpact Girls Clubs, formerly known as Missionettes Girls Clubs, are part of a worldwide program directed by National Girls Ministries within the Assemblies of God. The program is the counterpart ministry to Royal Rangers. The Clubs were created to allow girls an opportunity to discuss issues that matter to them and learn how to live according to Biblical principles given by Jesus.

The name was changed from Missionettes to Mpact Girls Clubs in March 2007 as part of a strategic plan to reach girls in a more holistic manner. The Clubs were subsequently divided into three categories to accommodate the boys in the two early clubs, Sunlight Kids and Rainbows.

The Missionettes were founded by the Assemblies of God Women&#x27;s Ministries in 1956.

===Purpose ===

Girls Ministries Clubs are driven by a 5-fold Purpose.

* To win girls to Jesus Christ through love and acceptance.
* To teach them to obey everything Jesus commanded us—developing girls spiritually and mentally.
* To provide encouragement, support and accountability through lasting Christian relationships.
* To provide an environment for girls to develop their gifts and abilities.
* To acquaint them with the Great Commission of Jesus Christ our Lord.

=== Girls Clubs Code ===

One of the distinctives that sets these clubs apart from other clubs is that there is a code which is the mind-set of all leaders and girls. The Code is Philippians 4:8 — &quot;Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.&quot; (NIV)

=== Club levels ===

Girls Ministries clubs are organized into three categories of clubs. The leaders of each club are called &quot;Sponsors&quot;.

Mpact Kids Clubs (Co-ed)
* Sunlight Kids is the club for nursery-age children up to 36 months. Boys and Girls may be part of the Sunlight Kids club.
* Rainbows is the club for 3 and 4 year olds. Boys and Girls may be part of the Rainbows club. When a boy starts Kindergarten he will move into the Royal Rangers program. The Rainbow colors are Green and White. The club motto is &quot;Rainbows are helpers.&quot;

Mpact Girls Clubs
* Daisies is the club for Kindergarten girls. It is a one-year program. The Daisies colors are Yellow and White. The club motto is &quot;Daisies tell about Jesus.&quot;
* Prims is the club for 1st and 2nd grade girls. The club colors are Pink and White. The Prims motto is &quot;I will be kind and thoughtful.&quot;
* Stars is the club for 3rd through 5th grade girls. The club colors are Blue and White. The Stars motto is &quot;I will follow Jesus.&quot;

Teen Girl Ministries (TGM)
* Friends is the club for 6th through 8th grade girls. The club colors are Purple and White. The Friends motto is &quot;We are committed to God.&quot;
* Girls Only is the club for 9th through 12th grade girls. The club colors are Red and White. The Girls Only motto is &quot;Every day in every way I will boldly live for God.&quot;

<text>Ballyclare Comrades Football Club is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Championship. The club hails from Ballyclare, County Antrim and plays its home matches at Dixon Park. Club colours are red and white. The club&#x27;s rivals are Carrick Rangers and Larne and games between the three clubs are referred to as &quot;The East Antrim Derbies&quot;.

==History==
The club was founded in 1919 by veterans of the First World War, most of them from &quot;C&quot; Company of the 12th Royal Irish Rifles – a battalion made up entirely of East Antrim men, who fought at the Somme and in many other famous First World War battles. From 1990 until 2003, the club enjoyed senior status, but reverted to intermediate status when the Irish Premier League was established and the number of senior clubs was reduced.

The club&#x27;s reserve team play in the NIFL Development League for under 20s. The club also has a partnership with local youth club Ballyclare Colts, whose sides (from under 11 to under 15) provide players to progress to Comrades&#x27; own youth sides at under-17 and under-18 level. The under-18 side play in the IFA Youth League.

The club was relegated to IFA Championship 2 in the 2010–11 season and finished in 6th place in the 2011–12 season, but the following season brought promotion back to Championship 1 after finishing as runners-up behind Championship 2 winners Knockbreda.
One of the club&#x27;s most famous products was Northern Ireland and Sunderland defender Paddy McNair who attends games when possible. Gareth McAuley, now of Rangers, and Michael Smith (Hearts) both played for the Comrades before switching to professional football.

The club finished an impressive third in the 2016–17 season, losing out in a promotion playoff to Institute. The club continues with the ambition of getting back into the NIFL Premiership.

<doc id="1345796" wikidata="Q17143910" url="?curid=1345796" title="Winchester Short Magnum">
<text>Winchester Short Magnum, or WSM, refers to a family of rebated bottlenecked centerfire short magnum cartridges developed in the early 2000s by the U.S. Repeating Arms Company, the maker of Winchester rifles and one of the oldest firearms manufacturers in the United States. All of the WSM cartridges are inspired on the .404 Jeffery non-belted magnum cartridge which is shortened to fit a short rifle action (such as a .308 Winchester).

It was developed by Rick Jamison in 1997-1998 as proven in a 2005 lawsuit Jamison vs. Olin Corporation-Winchester division. Jamison was given 7 patents on the cartridge design. U.S. Repeating Arms Company used the same concept and the same base case in creating its even shorter Winchester Super Short Magnum cartridges, three of which were introduced in 2003 and 2004.

==Influences==
===7.82 Lazzeroni Patriot===
The WSM family was inspired partially by a family of proprietary short magnum cartridges developed in late 1997, by John Lazzeroni, derived from a previous line of magnum cartridges he had created. The first Lazzeroni short magnum, the 7.82 Lazzeroni Patriot, was designed to operate in a short-action rifle, instead of requiring a long action. The U.S. Repeating Arms Company was the first major manufacturer to commercialize Lazzeroni&#x27;s concept, followed shortly thereafter by Remington with their &quot;Short Action Ultra Mag&quot; line.

===6 mm Benchrest===
Another influence was a series of 6 mm cartridges developed for bench-rest target shooting competitions in the 1970s. The idea behind these cartridges was that a short, fat cartridge would be more &quot;efficient&quot; than the traditional long, narrow cartridge, as more of the powder column would be in the immediate vicinity of the primer as it detonated. In turn, this would mean that a cartridge of this type would be able to propel a bullet at speeds comparable to those of &quot;magnum&quot; cartridges of the same caliber using significantly less powder.

==Dimensions==
The dimensions of the basic case are:
* Rim diameter (at base): .535 in. (13.59 mm)
* Outside diameter (at base): .555 in. (14.10 mm)
* Inside diameter (of case): .538 in. (13.67 mm)
* Maximum case length: 2.10 in. (53.34 mm)

The WSM family of cartridges are Delta L problem cartridges, meaning they can present unexpected chambering and/or feeding problems.

==Variants==
The 300 WSM was the first of the new class of short magnums to see wide use. All of the WSM cartridges released to date have proven popular for thin-skinned game up to the size of elk and African plains game, the .325 WSM being an excellent cartridge for elk, bison and similar big game.

The cartridges in this family are, in order of development:
