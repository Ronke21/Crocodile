<text>Suchomimus (meaning &quot;crocodile mimic&quot;) is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived between 125 and 112 million years ago in what is now Niger, North Africa, during the Aptian to early Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period. It was named and described by paleontologist Paul Sereno and colleagues in 1998, based on a partial skeleton from the Elrhaz Formation. &quot;Suchomimus&quot;&#x27;s long and shallow skull, similar to that of a crocodile, earns it its generic name, while the specific name Suchomimus tenerensis alludes to the locality of its first remains, the Ténéré Desert.

&quot;Suchomimus&quot; was a relatively large theropod, reaching in length and weighing . However, the age of the holotype specimen is uncertain, so it is unclear whether this size estimate would have been its maximum. The narrow head of &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was perched on a short neck, and its forelimbs were powerfully built, bearing a giant claw on each thumb. Along the midline of the animal&#x27;s back ran a low dorsal sail, built from the long neural spines of its vertebrae. Like other spinosaurids, it likely had a diet of fish,such as eels, rays and smaller aquatic animals.

Some palaeontologists consider the genus to be an African species of the European spinosaurid &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;B. tenerensis&quot;. &quot;Suchomimus&quot; might also be a junior synonym of the contemporaneous spinosaurid &quot;Cristatusaurus lapparenti&quot;, although the latter taxon is based on much more fragmentary remains. &quot;Suchomimus&quot; lived in a fluvial environment of vast floodplains alongside many other dinosaurs, in addition to pterosaurs, crocodylomorphs, bony fishes, testudines, and bivalves.

==Discovery and naming==
In 1997, American palaeontologist Paul Sereno and his team at Gadoufaoua discovered Fossils that represented about two-thirds of a large theropod dinosaur skeleton in Niger. The first find, a giant thumb claw, was made on 4 December 1997 by David Varricchio. In 1998, Sereno, Allison Beck, Didier Dutheil, Boubacar Gado, Hans Larsson, Gabrielle Lyon, Jonathan Marcot, Oliver Rauhut, Rudyard Sadleir, Christian Sidor, David Varricchio, Gregory Wilson and Jeffrey Wilson named and described the type species &quot;Suchomimus tenerensis&quot;. The generic name &quot;Suchomimus&quot; (&quot;crocodile mimic&quot;) is derived from the Ancient Greek σοῦχος, &quot;souchos&quot;, &quot;crocodile&quot;, and μῖμος, &quot;mimos&quot;, &quot;mimic&quot;, after the shape of the animal&#x27;s head. The specific name &quot;tenerensis&quot; is after the Ténéré Desert where the animal was found.

The holotype, MNN GDF500, was found in the Tegama Beds of the Elrhaz Formation. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains three neck ribs, parts of fourteen dorsal (back) vertebrae, ten dorsal ribs, gastralia (or &quot;belly ribs&quot;), pieces of three sacral vertebrae, parts of twelve caudal (tail) vertebrae, chevrons (bones that form the underside of the tail), a scapula (shoulder blade), a coracoid, a partial forelimb, most of the pelvis (hip bone), and parts of a hindlimb. The spinal column was largely articulated, the remainder consisted of disarticulated bones. Parts of the skeleton had been exposed on the desert surface and had suffered erosion damage. Additionally, several specimens have been assigned as paratypes: MNN GDF 501 to 508 include a snout, a quadrate from the back of the skull, three dentaries (tooth-bearing bones of the lower jaw), an axis (second neck vertebra), a rear cervical vertebra, and a rear dorsal vertebra. MNN GDF 510 to MNN GDF 511 comprise two caudal vertebrae. All of the original &quot;Suchomimus&quot; fossils are housed in the palaeontological collection of the Musée National du Niger. The initial description of &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was preliminary. In 2007, the furcula (wishbone)—found during an expedition in 2000—was described in detail.
&quot;S&quot;. &quot;tenerensis&quot; is potentially a junior synonym of another spinosaurid from the Elrhaz Formation, &quot;Cristatusaurus lapparenti&quot;, named the same year based on jaw fragments and vertebrae. The skull elements were considered indistinguishable from those of &quot;Baryonyx walkeri&quot; from the Barremian of England by British paleontologists Alan Charig and Angela Milner. In 1997 while describing &quot;S&quot;. &quot;tenerensis&quot;, Sereno and colleagues agreed with this assessment and concluded that &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot; was a dubious name. In 2002, the German palaeontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and colleagues concluded that &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was identical to &quot;Cristatusaurus lapparenti&quot;, and despite &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot; having been named somewhat earlier than &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, proposed them to represent a second species of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; called &quot;Baryonyx tenerensis&quot;. In a 2003 analysis, German paleontologist Oliver Rauhut concurred with this. In a 2004 conference abstract, Hutt and Newberry supported the synonymy based on a large theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they attributed to an animal closely related to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot;. Later studies have kept &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot; separate, whereas &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot; has been proposed to be either a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; or possibly distinct from both. A 2017 review paper by the palaeontologist Carlos Roberto A. Candeiro and colleagues stated that this debate was more in the realm of semantics than science, as it is generally agreed that &quot;B. walkeri&quot; and &quot;S. tenerensis&quot; are distinct, related species. Barker and colleagues found &quot;Suchomimus&quot; to be closer related to the British genera &quot;Riparovenator&quot; and &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot; than to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; in 2021.

==Description==
The length of the type specimen of &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, with undetermined age, reached in length and weighed . Therrein and Henderson proposed that a long &quot;Suchomimus&quot; would have weighed more than based on their ratio between skull length and body length; however, they noted that they might have overestimated the size of spinosaurids (i.e. &quot;Suchomimus&quot; and &quot;Baryonyx&quot;). The holotype of &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was considerably larger than that of &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, but the ages of the two individuals are not known.

=== Skull ===
Unlike most giant theropod dinosaurs, &quot;Suchomimus&quot; had a very crocodilian-like skull, with a long, low snout and narrow jaws formed by a forward expansion of the (frontmost snout bones) and the hind branch of the (main upper jaw bone). The premaxillae had an upward branch excluding the maxillae from the (bony nostrils). The jaws had about 122 conical teeth, pointed but not very sharp and curving slightly backwards, with fine serrations and wrinkled enamel. The tip of the snout was enlarged sideways and carried a &quot;terminal rosette&quot; of longer teeth, seven per side in the premaxillae and about the same number in the corresponding part of the lower jaw. Further back, there were at least 22 teeth per upper jaw side in the maxilla, while the entire lower jaw side carried 32 teeth in the dentary bone.

The upper jaw had a prominent kink just behind the rosette, protruding downwards; this convexly curved part of the maxilla had the longest teeth of the entire skull. The internal bone shelves of the maxillae met each other in the midline of the skull over a long distance, forming a closed secondary palate that stiffened the snout, and setting off the internal nostrils and palatal complex (including the pterygoid, palatine and ectopterygoid) towards the back of the skull. The nostrils, unlike in most theropods, were retracted further back on the skull and behind the premaxillary teeth. The external nares were long, narrow and horizontally positioned; the same was true of the larger antorbital fenestrae, a pair of bony openings in front of the eyes. The rear of the skull is poorly known but for a short quadrate bone, which had broad condyles (round protrusions) away from the centre of attachment and—like in the spinosaurid &quot;Baryonyx&quot;—had a large foramen (opening) separating it from the quadratojugal bone. The lower jaws were greatly elongated and narrow, forming a rigid structure as their dentaries touched each other at the midline, reinforcing the mandible against torsional (bending and twisting) forces.

=== Postcranial skeleton ===

The neck was relatively short but well-muscled as shown by strong epipophyses (processes to which neck muscles attached). There were about sixteen dorsal vertebrae. &quot;Suchomimus&quot; had significantly extended neural spines—blade-shaped upward extensions on the vertebrae—which were elongated at the rear back. Those of the five sacral vertebrae were the longest. The elongation of these structures continued until the middle of the tail. The spines may have held up some kind of low crest or sail of skin that was highest over its hips, lower and extending further to the back than that of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, in which the sail reached its highest peak over the dorsal vertebrae. This condition was more reduced in &quot;Baryonyx&quot;.

The furcula was V-shaped and indicates a high and narrow trunk. The scapula had a rectangular acromion, or attachment site for clavicle (collarbone). The (upper arm bone) was very strongly built, only equaled in size among non-spinosaurid theropods by that of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, with robust upper corners. The humerus had a boss (bone overgrowth) above the condyle that contacted its hook-shaped (forearm bone). Accordingly, the of the lower arm was well-developed with an enormous olecranon (upper process set-off from the shaft), an exceptional trait shared with &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. The heavy arm musculature powered sizable hand claws, that of the first digit (or &quot;thumb&quot;) being the largest with a length of . Only the third metacarpal (long bone of the hand) is known; showing a robust morphology (form). In the pelvis, the (main hip bone) was high. The (pubic bone) had a front surface that was wider than the side surface, and its forward-facing lower end was flattened and rectangular, with a brief flange along the midline, in contrast to the expanded boot shape it had in other theropods. The ischium (lower and rearmost hip bone) bore a low obturator flange. The (thighbone) was straight and robust, with a length of in the holotype. Its is markedly plate-like. In the ankle, the astragalus had an ascending process taller than that of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

==Classification==
The describers established some autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of &quot;Suchomimus&quot; to separate it from other theropods, including the expanded rear dorsal, sacral, and front caudal neural spines, the robust upper corners of the humerus, and the boss above the humerus&#x27; condyle that contacted its hook-shaped radius. Sereno and colleagues referred &quot;Suchomimus&quot; to the Spinosauridae and named two subfamilies within this clade, Baryonychinae (all spinosaurids more closely related to &quot;Baryonyx&quot;) and Spinosaurinae (all spinosaurids closer to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;). &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was a member of the subfamily Baryonychinae. Apart from its apparently taller sail, &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was very similar to the spinosaurid &quot;Baryonyx&quot; from the Barremian of England, and shared traits with it such as the reduced size and increased amount of teeth behind the snout tip in the mandible than spinosaurines, strong forelimbs, a huge sickle-curved claw on its &quot;thumb&quot;, and strongly keeled front dorsal vertebrae. Spinosaurines are characterized by straight, unserrated and more widely spaced teeth, and the small size of their first premaxillary teeth. Sereno and colleagues pointed out that the more retracted nostrils in &quot;Irritator&quot; and the tall sail of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; could also be unique traits of spinosaurines, though material from other taxa is needed to know for sure. As with &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, the claw of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; had been the first discovered fossil of the animal. Sereno and colleagues in 1998 analyzed the distribution of forty-five traits to produce a cladogram that showed &quot;Suchomimus&quot; and &quot;Baryonyx&quot; to be distinct but closely related. Later, Barker and colleagues, in 2021, created a new tribe within Baryonychinae: Ceratosuchopsini, a clade that includes &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot;, &quot;Riparovenator&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot;.

The following phylogenetic tree shows a 2009 analysis of the Megalosauroidea.

=== Evolution ===

Spinosaurids appear to have been widespread from the Barremian to the Cenomanian stages of the Cretaceous period, about 130 to 95 million years ago, while the oldest known spinosaurid remains date to the Middle Jurassic. They shared features such as long, narrow, crocodile-like skulls; sub-circular teeth, with fine to no serrations; the terminal rosette of the snout; and a secondary palate that made them more resistant to torsion. In contrast, the primitive and typical condition for theropods was a tall, narrow snout with blade-like (ziphodont) teeth with serrated carinae. The skull adaptations of spinosaurids converged with those of Crocodilians; early members of the latter group had skulls similar to typical theropods, later developing elongated snouts, conical teeth, and secondary palates. These adaptations may have been the result of a dietary change from terrestrial prey to fish. Unlike crocodiles, the post-cranial skeletons of baryonychine spinosaurids do not appear to have aquatic adaptations. Sereno and colleagues proposed in 1998 that the large thumb-claw and robust forelimbs of spinosaurids evolved in the Middle Jurassic, before the elongation of the skull and other adaptations related to fish-eating, since the former features are shared with their megalosaurid relatives. They also suggested that the spinosaurines and baryonychines diverged before the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous.

Several hypotheses have been proposed about the biogeography of the spinosaurids. Since &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was more closely related to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; (from Europe) than to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting. Sereno and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the supercontinent Pangea, but split with the opening of the Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwana) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with &quot;Suchomimus&quot; the result of a single north-to-south dispersal event. Buffetaut and the Tunisian palaeontologist Mohamed Ouaja also suggested in 2002 that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to have replaced the former in Africa. Milner suggested in 2003 that spinosaurids originated in Laurasia during the Jurassic, and dispersed via the Iberian land bridge into Gondwana, where they radiated. In 2007, Buffetaut pointed out that palaeogeographical studies had demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous, which he found to confirm Milner&#x27;s idea that the Iberian region was a stepping stone between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and possibly Australia indicate that it may have been complex. The findings of Barker &quot;et al.&quot; (2021) are consistent with Milner&#x27;s findings, where Spinosauridae arose in Europe and there were at least two migrations to Africa.

== Palaeobiology ==

Charig and Milner had proposed a piscivorous (fish-eating) diet for the closely related &quot;Baryonyx&quot; in 1986. This was later confirmed in 1997 with the discovery of partially digested fish scales found in the &quot;Baryonyx&quot; holotype. In 1998 Sereno and colleagues suggested the same dietary preference for &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, based on its elongated jaws, spoon-shaped terminal rosette, and long teeth reminiscent of those of piscivorous crocodilians. American palaeontologist Thomas Holtz noted that spinosaurid teeth were adapted for grasping rather than slicing, hence their reduced serrations, which in most other theropods were more prominent. &quot;Suchomimus&quot;&#x27;s extensive secondary palate, which would have made the roof of the mouth more solid, allowed it to better resist twisting forces exerted by prey. The rest of &quot;Suchomimus&quot;&#x27;s body was not particularly adapted to the water. The discovery of &quot;Suchomimus&quot; revealed that spinosaurid skulls were significantly shallower, more elongated and narrow than previously thought.

The use of the robust forelimbs and giant claws of spinosaurs remains a debated topic. Charig and Milner speculated in 1986 that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; may have crouched by the riverbank and used its claws to gaff fish out of the water, similarly to Grizzly bears. In 1987, British biologist Andrew Kitchener hypothesized a use in scavenging carcasses, though this has been critiqued by other researchers who pointed out that in most cases, a carcass would have already been largely emptied out by its initial predators. A 2005 study by Canadian paleontologist François Therrien and colleagues posited that spinosaur forelimbs were probably used for hunting larger prey items, given that their snouts could not resist the bending stress. In a 2017 review of the family, David Hone and Holtz also considered possible functions in digging for water sources or hard to reach prey, as well as burrowing into soil to construct nests.

A 2022 study comparing the bone densities of &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; reveals that spinosaurids had ecologically disparate lifestyles. &quot;Suchomimus&quot; itself was more adapted to a life hunting in shallow water due to its hollow bones, while &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; were capable of fully submerging underwater and diving after prey. Courtesy of denser bones, the latter two spinosaurids could hunt underwater for prey and occupy a more derived lifestyle than &quot;Suchomimus&quot; could.

== Palaeoecology ==

The Elrhaz Formation, part of the Tegama Group, consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. &quot;Suchomimus&quot; lived in what is now Niger, during the late Aptian to early Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, 112 million years ago. The sediment layers of the formation have been interpreted as an inland habitat of extensive freshwater floodplains and fast-moving rivers, with a tropical climate that likely experienced seasonal dry periods.

This environment was home to a variety of fauna including dinosaurs, pterosaurs, turtles, fish, hybodont sharks, and freshwater bivalves.&quot;&quot; &quot;Suchomimus&quot; coexisted with other theropods like the abelisaurid &quot;Kryptops palaios&quot;, the carcharodontosaurid &quot;Eocarcharia dinops&quot;, and an unknown noasaurid. Herbivorous dinosaurs of the region included iguanodontians like &quot;Ouranosaurus nigeriensis&quot;, &quot;Elrhazosaurus nigeriensis, Lurdusaurus arenatus,&quot; and two sauropods: &quot;Nigersaurus taqueti,&quot; and an unnamed titanosaur. Crocodylomorphs were abundant; represented by the giant pholidosaur species &quot;Sarcosuchus imperator&quot;, as well as small notosuchians like &quot;Anatosuchus minor,&quot; &quot;Araripesuchus wegeneri&quot;, and &quot;Stolokrosuchus lapparenti.&quot; The local flora probably consisted mainly of ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms, based on the dietary adaptations of the large diplodocoids that lived there.

<text>Miami station is a train station in Miami-Dade County, Florida, on the border of Miami and Hialeah. It is the southern terminus for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Floridian&quot; and &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; trains. The station opened in 1978 to replace a 48-year-old Seaboard Air Line Railroad station. It is several blocks away from the Tri-Rail and Metrorail Transfer Station, but there is no direct connection between the two.

==History==
When Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in May 1971, it continued to use the former Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) depot at 2210 NW 7th Avenue in Allapattah, two miles north of downtown. The SAL station, built in 1930, soon began to show its age. On May13, 1977, Amtrak began construction of a new station near the SAL&#x27;s Hialeah Yards.

Opened on June20, 1978, the building is one of many built under Amtrak&#x27;s Standard Stations Program, an attempt to create a unified brand and identity for the company&#x27;s passenger facilities in its early years. It is considered a Type 300A station, meaning it was designed to accommodate at least 300 passengers at the busiest hour of the day. It is nearly identical to the now closed Midway station in Saint Paul, Minnesota, which was also built in 1978.

The building measures by with of floor space, with a large waiting room and other passenger facilities on the ground floor. A mezzanine houses a lounge and Amtrak regional offices. The $5.7million station construction project ($ in adjusted for inflation) included the fully handicapped accessible station, a 269-car parking lot, and two -long platforms to handle Amtrak&#x27;s lengthy Florida trains. A loop track runs around the station complex, allowing trains to be turned around for their northbound trips. The last trains arrived at the ex-SAL station on June19, 1978; the northbound &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; departed from the new station on June 20 shortly before the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

In the early 1990s, the Florida Department of Transportation began planning an intermodal station to link Tri-Rail, Amtrak, and Metrorail to the Miami International Airport. These plans were completed as the Miami Intermodal Center, located south of the current station and an equal distance west of downtown. Metrorail opened to the station in 2012, Tri-Rail commuter trains began serving the new platforms in April 2015, and Amtrak was originally expected to serve this station in 2016, but an error during design resulted in the constructed platforms too short to accommodate the longer trains Amtrak uses during the winter. The original design would have resulted in grade crossings being blocked by the last cars of these longer trains. After changes to traffic patterns around the station, Amtrak was initially expected to move to Miami Airport Station in late 2018.

By late 2018, the move had been postponed indefinitely. In 2021, Amtrak reached out to FDOT to begin negotiations again for utilization of the Miami Intermodal Center. Test train operations began in February 2022 with negotiations continuing. On November10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

Amtrak reversed course of utilizing the Miami Intermodal Center in December 2024, sending a short letter to transportation officials negotiating the station lease&#x27;s final details. The letter said Amtrak was no longer interested in running trains to the station and had determined that operating its trains from the station would be too expensive. Data released in February 2025 show that Amtrak projected moving to the MIC would have added 20,000 annual passengers and $2million in revenue but $5million in operating costs. MIC would have needed $6.4million in renovations for Amtrak service, versus $21.8million to renovate the older station for accessibility.

==Station layout==
The station has three tracks with two low-level platforms. The station building is located south of Track 1 and directly adjacent to the eastern platform.

<text>The Coin Coalition is an organization supporting the elimination of pennies and one dollar bills from U.S. currency. It is funded by vending machine companies, video-arcade owners, and the soft-drink industry, who all have an interest in eliminating maintenance costs associated with bill validators. The National Bulk Vendors Association supports the Coalition.

Manufacturers converted machines to accept the one dollar coin at great expense, but the unwillingness of the U.S. government to phase out the dollar bill has prevented dollar coins from becoming popular. Although copper miners and other interest groups backed the Coin Coalition on this issue, they were unable to match the influence of Save the Greenback, a rival organization supporting continued production of $1 bills.

In 1995, Tom Davis, introducing the Save the Greenback Act, warned that customers&#x27; pockets would be weighted down with heavy coins. However, a 1997 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; disputed this notion by noting, &quot;This argument ignores the vast number of quarters now required for parking meters, vending machines, buses and many other staples of life. For a lot of transactions, an attractive $1 coin would be a great convenience. And although we would all be walking around with a few $1 coins, they would be replacing several quarters&quot;.

In advocating abolition of the penny, the Coin Coalition cites three penny-related costs that are passed on to consumers:
*Wrapping charges (stores pay about 60 cents for each roll of 50 pennies)
*Lost store productivity from penny users slowing the checkout line
*Lost wages paid to clerks counting pennies in the register on each shift

James C. Benfield, a partner with Bracy Williams and Company (Washington, D.C.), led the Coalition from 1987 until his death in 2002. He testified in committee hearings on the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997.

<text>Eastern Mennonite University (EMU) is a private Mennonite university in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The university also operates a satellite campus in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which primarily caters to working adults. EMU is known for its Center for Justice and Peacebuilding (CJP), particularly its graduate program in conflict transformation.

==History==
 Eastern Mennonite University was launched in 1917 as the Eastern Mennonite School by a group of Mennonite church members. They recognized that their church-centered communities needed to offer schooling beyond the basic level for young-adult Mennonites. These church leaders sought to stem the tide toward enrolling in secular educational institutions. One of that founding group, Bishop George R. Brunk Sr., stated that &quot;the world standard of education is self-centered, self-exalting, and materialistic.&quot; By contrast, he advocated a form of Christian education that &quot;expands and develops the God-given powers both natural and spiritual, guides them [students] into channels of activity most conducive to God&#x27;s glory and the blessing of mankind.&quot;

Eastern Mennonite&#x27;s first registrar, John Early Suter, believed that the university should offer secular academics in addition to Bible classes, and he was one of the first two such teachers. The Suter Science Center was named in honor of J. Early Suter&#x27;s son, Daniel Suter, who taught in the Biology department from 1948 to 1985. In 1947, the school began to offer bachelors degrees in subjects other than theology and changed its name for the first time, becoming Eastern Mennonite College.

In 1948–49, EMU admitted two local African American students, becoming one of the first historically white colleges in the U.S. South to integrate prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (The University of Arkansas also admitted African American students, beginning in 1948.)

EMU served only members of the Mennonite church in the early and mid 1900s, but since then has educated thousands other than its original constituency of &quot;Anabaptists,&quot; a broad term for Mennonites and kindred subscribers to the theology of Anabaptism. EMU and its seminary are affiliated with the Mennonite Education Agency of the Mennonite Church USA, as are five other higher education institutions in Kansas, Indiana and Ohio – Bethel College (Kansas), Goshen College, Bluffton University, Hesston College and Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary.

In 1994, the college changed its name for a second time, becoming Eastern Mennonite University.

In the last 20 years in particular, EMU has attracted people from all over the world and various faiths who are interested in the way it combines peace, social justice, simplicity and community. EMU orients its students toward &quot;experiential learning&quot; (i.e. hands-on learning, connected to real-world work), &quot;creation care&quot; (environmental sustainability), and &quot;cross-cultural engagement&quot; (required of all undergraduates).

The university made national news in 2015 when it, along with Goshen College (also associated with the Mennonite Church USA), added sexual orientation to their nondiscrimination policy. This allowed the school to begin hiring faculty or staff members who were in a same-sex marriage. The decision put the school somewhat at odds with its affiliated denomination, the Mennonite Church USA, and out of step with the interests of the CCCU, of which it was a founding member. This decision prompted two fellow Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) member schools – Union University and Oklahoma Wesleyan University (OKWU) – to quit the organization in protest. The two Mennonite schools later chose to withdraw their membership from the consortium in order to spare &quot;significant division&quot; within the CCCU&#x27;s ranks.

== Mission and values ==
EMU attempts to graduate people oriented toward the wider world and toward helping others. The wider Mennonite culture of service is reflected in the university&#x27;s mission statement. EMU is home to the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding, and its mission statement refers to Micah 6:8 on doing justice, loving mercy and walking humbly with God.

===Environmentalism===
 EMU claims that it is a leader among universities countywide in low-energy consumption, solar energy production, sustainable new construction, recycling, and composting efforts. Three residence halls meet the gold-level requirements of LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).

===Peace studies===
The university hosts the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding (CJP) which includes a graduate program in conflict transformation. CJP has educated and trained more than 3,000 people from 124 countries. CJP&#x27;s founding director, John Paul Lederach, and its expert in restorative justice, Howard Zehr, are considered to be international leaders in the fields of peace and justice.

===Views on same-sex relationships===
The school&#x27;s &quot;Community Lifestyle Commitment&quot; statement had been cited as reason for terminating the employment of faculty and staff members who were sexually active gay men or lesbians. In 2004, then-President Loren Swartzendruber stated that the university&#x27;s and Mennonite Church USA&#x27;s policy was that &quot;sexual relationships are reserved for a man and a woman in marriage&quot; and applied equally to faculty members who are heterosexual. He noted that two heterosexual employees had also been let go after having extramarital sexual relationships.

However, in November 2013 EMU&#x27;s Board of Trustees suspended the enforcement of its same-sex relationships policy and authorized Swartzendruber to lead a six-month study of whether or not to allow tenure-track faculty to pursue same-sex relationships without censure.

On 16 July 2015, EMU&#x27;s board added &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to their non-discrimination policy, allowing for the hiring of faculty and staff involved in same-sex marriages.

==Academics==
As of 2010 EMU&#x27;s undergraduate programs included 35 majors, 16 teacher education certification programs, 9 pre-professional programs such as pre-engineering and health sciences, and 4 associate degrees. Both the Harrisonburg and Lancaster locations offer an Adult Degree Completion Program. 98% of job-seeking graduate from the class of 2021 were employed within 12 months of graduation.

Each year EMU offers high-achieving high school students the opportunity to be part of the university&#x27;s honors program. Selected students can receive 50% to 100% tuition scholarships, renewable for each year of undergraduate study. They also receive mentoring from assigned faculty members and attend honors seminars and social gatherings together.

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, EMU accepted 99.5% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered elite, applicant competition considered very low, and with those enrolled having an average 3.7 high school GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores, the university having a test blind policy. Those enrolled that submitted test scores had an average 1320 SAT score (3% submitting scores) or an average 29 ACT score (4% submitting scores).

===Rankings===

For 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked EMU tied for No.48 out of 135 Regional Universities South. 

===Cross-cultural study requirement===
 EMU was one of the earliest colleges to require cross-cultural study of all undergraduates, with a university-sponsored program beginning in the 1970s. EMU recommends that its undergraduate students earn 15 semester hours of credit by living, studying and serving in cross-cultural settings. Nine cross-cultural credits are the minimum number required for graduation; these can be earned through in-class study and a summer stint of three to six weeks in a cross-cultural setting. Most undergraduates embark on semester-long, faculty-led, cross-cultural experiences, usually involving home stays in non-U.S. settings, such as Israel, Guatemala, South Africa, India, Spain and Morocco. But some students opt to satisfy the cross-cultural requirement by studying and interning in Washington, D.C., while living in EMU-owned housing supervised by faculty members. Others choose individualized alternatives, such as a summer of studying business with an international manufacturer or 11 months of service with the SALT program of Mennonite Central Committee.

More than 75% of EMU&#x27;s faculty members have lived in a cross-cultural context. The leaders of EMU-sponsored trips are drawn from the ranks of faculty and staff members who have had extensive experience in the settings to which they are leading students. Since 2001, three EMU faculty members have been Fulbright Scholars.

===Seminary, graduate and summer programs===
EMU&#x27;s Graduate School offers master&#x27;s degrees. Extensive summer study programs are available through: EMU&#x27;s Summer Peacebuilding Institute (four consecutive sessions); Washington Community Scholars&#x27; Program; Summer Bridge Scholarship Program, in which EMU collaborates with the National Science Foundation to offer scholarships for incoming science students to spend a summer working with faculty; a Ministry Inquiry Program in which upper-level students are able to spend 11 weeks as an intern in a congregation; nine-day Summer Institute for Spiritual Formation; graduate-level courses for teachers. The Intensive English Program attracts students who need to improve their mastery of spoken and written English before continuing into higher studies at EMU or another American college.


==Campus life==
===Expectations for community members===
Eastern Mennonite&#x27;s 361-word &quot;Community Lifestyle Commitment&quot; was adopted by the board of trustees in 2001. With this document as a guide, the institution expects its employees and students to commit themselves to a lifestyle based on &quot;clearly stated expectations [to] promote orderly community life,&quot; coupled with &quot;trust in and responsibility to one another&quot;. It calls for &quot;stewardship of mind, time, abilities and finances&quot; and takes the unusual step of asking for &quot;social responsibility in my standard of living and use of economic resources&quot;. EMU expects community members to &quot;respect and abide by the university policy that prohibits the use of alcohol and tobacco on campus or at university functions and the misuse of alcohol off campus&quot;.

The statement also asks community members to refrain from &quot;sexual harassment and abuse, pornography, acts of violence, abusive or demeaning language and the use of illegal drugs&quot; as well as &quot;sexual relationships outside of marriage&quot;. However, the school does permit homosexual activity within the confines of marriage.

===Campus ministries===
Residential undergraduates, faculty, and staff gather for twice-weekly chapel services planned by the campus pastoral team. Voluntary Bible study and worship also occur in smaller settings during the week and on weekends.

The Campus Ministries program sponsors activities such as campus-wide chapels on Wednesday and Friday mornings, a student-led praise-style service on Sunday evenings, monthly hymn sings and Taize worship services, annual &quot;spiritual life week&quot;, and service experiences under the Young People&#x27;s Christian Association. Campus Ministries is led by the three trained pastors, assisted by students at various stages in their education including seminary students at EMU. Pastoral Assistants live in residence buildings and plan voluntary weekly activities.

===Outdoor and indoor recreation===
 As a result of EMU&#x27;s location, bicycling is popular among the faculty and students as a means to commute, do errands, and for recreational jaunts around the countryside, both on and off roads.

Other popular outdoor activities are kayaking &amp; canoeing, swimming, golfing, hiking, horseback riding, hunting &amp; fishing, spelunking and skiing &amp; other winter sports at nearby private and public parks and centers, such as Shenandoah National Park, George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, and Massanutten Four-Season Resort. On campus, students, staff and faculty maintain a greenhouse, an arboretum, and a large vegetable garden.

Indoor recreational features include gyms (for basketball, volleyball, indoor soccer, etc.), fitness center with exercise equipment, and climbing wall. Swimmers head 2.1 miles to the year-round municipal swimming pool at Westover Park.

===Athletics===

 EMU&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Royals. In most sports, EMU competes as NCAA Division III, a member of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. Sports include field hockey, cross country, basketball, volleyball, soccer, baseball, softball, indoor and outdoor track and field, and golf.

===Extracurriculars===
Two-thirds of EMU&#x27;s students participate in intramural sports, playing against peers as well as college employees, in friendly, often coed competitions. In 2009–10, dozens of teams competed at various levels in basketball, billiards, floor hockey, flag football, golf, table tennis, and dodgeball.

Beyond physical activities, students at EMU are involved in clubs and groups typical of college campuses, such as student government, the student newspaper, literary magazine and theater productions.

===Music===
Students participate from a variety of choral and instrumental musical groups, including men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and mixed vocal ensembles, as well as chamber and wind ensembles, a jazz band, and a chamber orchestra. EMU&#x27;s music department is home to the proficient hymnal editor, faculty member, and chamber singers director Ken J. Nafziger, who also directs and conducts the annual Shenandoah Valley Bach Festival and the Winchester Musica Viva.

<text>Charles Frederick Turner (born October 16, 1943) is a Canadian rock bassist, vocalist and songwriter, and was a founding member of the 1970s rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive (B.T.O.). He is credited on most B.T.O. albums as &quot;C.F. Turner&quot;.

== History ==
Fred Turner played in over a dozen bands in and around Winnipeg during his early adult years, his first vocal recordings being with the group Pink Plumm, which released one independent single titled &quot;Along Came Pride&quot;. Based upon advice Randy Bachman received from Neil Young, Turner was subsequently asked to join Randy&#x27;s band Brave Belt in 1971. At the time, Turner was playing and singing in a cover band called the D-Drifters. The D-Drifters wanted to continue doing cover songs, and had repeatedly rejected Turner&#x27;s original compositions. When the call came from Bachman, Turner jumped at the chance to join a band that played original material.

The lead vocalist for the first Brave Belt album was Chad Allan, Randy Bachman&#x27;s former bandmate from The Guess Who. While shopping around the tapes to record companies and eventually getting interest from Reprise Records, Randy was required to list the band members for contracts. Although he had played both lead guitar and bass on the recording, Randy listed Turner as the bassist. Turner&#x27;s photo was put on the &quot;Brave Belt&quot; back cover, but he was not involved in the recordings.

Turner did join Brave Belt for live performances to support the first album, and soon stepped in as a full-time lead vocalist and bassist, which led to the departure of Allan. Fred contributed five song compositions to the follow-up &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; album (1972), and he sang lead vocal on nine of the album&#x27;s eleven songs. The &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; touring lineup, which now consisted of Turner with Randy, Robbie and Tim Bachman, recorded another album despite being dropped from Reprise Records. While shopping around this &quot;Brave Belt III&quot; album and eventually being signed by Mercury Records, the band changed its name to Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO). Although Randy Bachman was the more widely known name because of his years with The Guess Who, Robbie Bachman stated in numerous interviews that there could have been no &quot;BTO sound&quot; without Turner&#x27;s contributions: &quot;The first Brave Belt album was very country-rock. Everything changed when Fred joined the band. We had Fred Turner&#x27;s heavy, rough voice. We evolved because of Mr. Turner.&quot; Said Turner himself, &quot;I think I brought a hard edge to the band. It was pretty countryish when I joined.&quot;

Turner and BTO enjoyed a period of peak popularity between 1973 and 1976, which saw the band release five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). Fred composed and sang lead on BTO&#x27;s first charting single, &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (#68 in 1973), which appeared on the band&#x27;s debut album. However, it was the second album, &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;, that made BTO a household name, propelled by the hits &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; and &quot;Let It Ride&quot; (the latter featuring Turner as lead vocalist and co-composer). The band then found international success with the 1974 album &quot;Not Fragile&quot;, which hit #1 in both the US and Canada while reaching the top ten in several other countries. BTO had two more hit albums with &quot;Four Wheel Drive&quot; and &quot;Head On&quot;, which charted at Nos. 5 and 23, respectively, in the US.

When Randy Bachman left Bachman–Turner Overdrive in late 1977, Turner switched from bass to rhythm guitar to make room for bassist–vocalist Jim Clench. This new line-up for 1978–79 was only called B.T.O. and nothing else, due to legal issues surrounding the use of the Bachman surname. After two albums and supporting tours through late 1979, this version of B.T.O. officially disbanded in early 1980. Turner resumed his original role on the bass upon rejoining Randy Bachman in a band called Union, which released a 1981 album titled &quot;On Strike&quot;. Bachman–Turner Overdrive then re-formed for a 1984 album and subsequent tour. Turner continued to perform in touring versions of B.T.O. through 2004, with the only new original material being released on the 1996 album &quot;Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest&quot;. Turner&#x27;s last performance on stage with any formation of B.T.O. was in 2004 with Randy Murray. The two were backed by members of the Little River Band because drummer Robbie Bachman and guitarist Blair Thornton were unable to attend B.T.O.&#x27;s last show. Turner is the only member of Bachman–Turner Overdrive to be on every album the band released.

Turner is the lead vocalist on many of Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s most popular tracks, including &quot;Roll On Down the Highway,&quot; &quot;Let It Ride,&quot; &quot;Blue Collar,&quot; &quot;Four Wheel Drive,&quot; &quot;Not Fragile&quot; and &quot;Take It Like a Man.&quot; His songwriting credits include &quot;Gimme Your Money Please,&quot; &quot;Blue Collar,&quot; &quot;Not Fragile,&quot; &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot; (with Blair Thornton), &quot;Let It Ride&quot; (with Randy Bachman) and &quot;Roll On Down the Highway&quot; (with Robbie Bachman). Turner also wrote and sang the lead on &quot;Heartaches&quot; (1979), the lone B.T.O. single to chart in the post-Randy Bachman era.

Turner recorded a solo song for the &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; CD called &quot;Walk With You&quot; in 1996. The &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; album was put together by Riff West. Other musicians that recorded songs for this album include Lonesome Dave Peverett of Foghat, Pat Travers, and Edgar Winter. In 2000, he made a voice appearance with Randy Bachman on an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In 2014, Turner and the rest of the &quot;Not Fragile&quot;-era Bachman-Turner Overdrive band members were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

==2010 Bachman and Turner reunion==
Turner reunited with Randy Bachman and recorded a new self-titled album that was released in September 2010 under the name &quot;Bachman &amp; Turner.&quot; Originally, Randy was developing a solo album and asked Fred to be a guest vocalist on one track called &quot;Rock n’ Roll is the Only Way Out&quot;. However, after Fred sent back the track with his voice added, Randy was so impressed at how well the vocals fit the music, he decided to scrap his solo effort in favour of a full-on collaboration with Turner.

Bachman and Turner embarked on a 2010–11 world tour in support of their 2010 album, though numerous BTO songs were also played in their live set. The B&amp;T world tour opened in June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival. The two continued on-and-off concert tours for several more years until, in March 2018, Randy Bachman announced that the 74-year-old Turner had amicably retired from touring.

<text>Frederick Leo Turner (January 6, 1933 – January 7, 2013) was an American restaurant industry executive, chair and CEO of McDonald&#x27;s. He is credited with helping to massively expand McDonald&#x27;s, introducing new meals and setting service standards for the company and its employees.

==Early life==
Turner grew up in Des Moines and Chicago, going to high school at Dowling Catholic High School, and graduated from Drake University in 1954.

After college, he served in the U.S. Army.

==Career==
Turner began his career at McDonald&#x27;s in 1956 as a grill operator and was quickly promoted. He was named Operations Vice President in 1958, when the firm had only 34 restaurants. In that role, he established strict guidelines for how McDonald&#x27;s hamburgers and other products had to be served - including that fries &quot;had to be precisely 0.28 inches thick&quot;, and that &quot;exactly ten patties had to be formed from each pound of beef&quot;. &quot;Quality, Service and Cleanliness&quot; became his motto. He became Executive Vice President in 1967, then President and Chief Administrative Officer in 1968. He became CEO in 1973 and replaced Kroc as Chairman in 1977, later named Senior Chairman upon Kroc&#x27;s death. Under Turner, McDonald&#x27;s expanded its operations to 118 countries, with over 31,000 outlets, and more than a billion hamburgers were sold.

He retired in 1987, after which he served as Honorary Chairman.

==Awards and memberships==
Turner served as a director for Aon Corporation, Baxter International, and W. W. Grainger. He received the Horatio Alger Award in 1991. He was a member of the Bohemian Club and Sigma Phi Epsilon.

==Personal life==
On June 22, 1954, soon after graduating college, Turner married fellow Drake graduate Patricia Shurtleff. The couple had three daughters. Patricia died on October 9, 2000.

Fred Turner died on January 7, 2013, the day after his 80th birthday, due to complications from pneumonia.

== Pop culture ==
Fred Turner has a small reference to his position as a grill operator in the 2016 film &quot;The Founder&quot;, which portrays the creation of the McDonald&#x27;s fast-food restaurant chain. At a later point in the plot in this same movie, Fred Turner has a much larger presence, during Ray Kroc&#x27;s successful attempts to open up McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in the Twin Cities area in Minnesota.

He is also amply portrayed in season 2, episode 12 &quot;Game of Chicken&quot; of The History Channel series &quot;The Food That Built America&quot;.

<text>Sweet Briar College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Sweet Briar, Amherst County, Virginia. It was established in 1901 by Indiana Fletcher Williams in memory of her deceased daughter, Daisy. The college formally opened its doors in 1906 and granted the B.A. degree for the first time in 1910. It nearly closed in 2015 but was saved by donations and legal actions by alumnae.

Sweet Briar is known for its campus with its historic Georgian Revival architecture by Ralph Adams Cram and its of hills, forests, and fields.

==History==

===Sweet Briar plantation===
The college is named after the former plantation of Elijah Fletcher and his descendants. Fletcher was a 19th-century teacher, businessman and mayor of Lynchburg, Virginia. He married Maria Antoinette Crawford in 1813, and purchased the Sweet Briar plantation property from her aunt and uncle, where he used slave labor to run the plantation and his household. The plantation was initially known as Locust Ridge; Crawford supposedly renamed it &quot;Sweet Briar&quot; after the roses which grew on the land. Their daughter, Indiana Fletcher, was born in 1828 in Lynchburg.

Indiana attended the Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, Doane Academy, and later toured Europe with her brother and sister. She met James Henry Williams, a student at Union Theological Seminary in 1858, and after reuniting in Virginia following the American Civil War, they were married in 1865. Their daughter, Maria Georgiana &quot;Daisy&quot; Williams, was born in 1867. At Elijah Fletcher&#x27;s death, Indiana inherited the plantation. James Williams gave up his initial career as a clergyman to maintain the property. Daisy Williams died at the age of 16 in 1884. Both James and Indiana Fletcher-Williams were devastated at her death, and James expressed a wish in his own will that a school might be established in honor of Daisy. William died in 1889, leaving his entire estate to his wife, and Indiana&#x27;s brother Sidney also gave her additional property upon his death in 1898. When Indiana died in 1900, she bequeathed Sweet Briar plantation to become a school for young women.

By his death in 1858, Elijah Fletcher enslaved over 110 people. After the emancipation in 1865, several formerly enslaved people and descendants of enslaved people continued to work for pay and live at Sweet Briar, including Martha Penn Taylor, who worked for three generations of the Fletcher-Williams family, and Signora Hollins (who was Indiana Fletcher&#x27;s childhood playmate). Some descendants of the people enslaved by the family still work at the college, and others hold family reunions on campus.

===Indiana Fletcher Williams&#x27; bequest and official opening===
In 1901, with the assistance of then Virginia state senator Carter Glass, the Virginia General Assembly issued a charter to Sweet Briar Institute as indicated in the will of Indiana Fletcher Williams. The will stated that the land of Sweet Briar plantation must be used as a &quot;school or seminary to be known as the &quot;Sweet Briar institute,&quot; for the education of white girls and young women. It shall be the general scope and object of the school to impart to its students such education in sound learning, and such physical, moral and religious training as shall, in the judgment of the directors, best fit them to be useful members of society&quot;.

In 1906, Sweet Briar College officially opened with 51 students and granted its first AB degrees in 1910. In 1932, Sweet Briar&#x27;s study abroad exchange program with the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, was established. In 1948, the renowned Junior Year in France (JYF) program was launched, followed by a number of other study abroad programs.

===Civil Rights era changes===
Legal action to alter Indiana Fletcher Williams&#x27; will was required to admit African-American students, as it had limited the purpose of the college to the education of solely white women. On August 17, 1964, wishing to eliminate &quot;white&quot; from the charter and comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sweet Briar filed a bill of complaint with the Amherst County Circuit Court. The request was initially denied at the state level, with the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney General stating that the will was &quot;plain, unambiguous, conclusive, and binding&quot;.

After several years of unsuccessful state litigation, the college filed a complaint with the federal United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. On April 25, 1966, Judge Thomas J. Michie issued a temporary restraining order that prevented enforcement of the racial restriction. On July 17, 1967, a three-judge Charlottesville court confirmed permanence of the restraining order. The first African-American student, Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, was admitted to the college in September 1966.

===Distinguishing features and early decades===

Sweet Briar long held a robust academic reputation. During its first decade, Sweet Briar ran a &quot;sub-college&quot; department to prepare students for college-level work. The original board of trustees appointed in Williams&#x27; will maintained that the college would be the academic equivalent of Smith, Wellesley and Mount Holyoke. The difference in Sweet Briar&#x27;s curriculum was the inclusion of &quot;hands-on&quot; or &quot;practical&quot; courses, as well as physical education, in accordance with Williams&#x27; directive that the school produce &quot;useful members of society&quot;. This forward-thinking approach evolved into the college&#x27;s core mission, where students have direct access to their disciplines while gaining real-world and classroom learning experience. During the first few years of the college, this concept quickly gave way to a more traditional liberal arts curriculum.

===2015 closure attempt===

====Pending closure announced by board====
On March 3, 2015, the college&#x27;s board of directors, following a unanimous vote on February 28, 2015, announced the college would close on August 25, 2015, due to &quot;insurmountable financial challenges&quot;. They cited declining enrollment and an endowment insufficient to cover potentially large-scale changes needed to boost enrollment, like coeducation. Another possible factor presented by the board was a declining interest in the traditional women&#x27;s college model. Sweet Briar had explored merging with other stronger institutions including the University of Virginia, but nothing came of it.The board announced that academic activity was to cease on August 25, 2015, the college&#x27;s pending closing date. Some professors said they received termination notices stating their last day of work would be May 30, 2015; the last day of employment for most was June 30, 2015.

Between 2011 and March 2015, Sweet Briar&#x27;s endowment had dropped from $96.2 to $84 million, as the college drew on endowment for operating expenses. Most of the college&#x27;s endowment is restricted, meaning the money must serve designated purposes, such as scholarships or faculty chairs. According to Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P), which rates the college&#x27;s bond debt, only $19 million was unrestricted, $18 million temporarily restricted, and $53 million permanently restricted. Sweet Briar is burdened with about $25 million in debt owed primarily to bondholders, and the college faced the possibility of default and an accelerated lump-sum payment of the entire amount.

College Board representatives explained that with insolvency inevitable—even though the college was still technically solvent—the Board felt the responsible course was an advance announcement of the closing. That would let enrolled students transfer at the beginning of a new academic year and prevent an entering first-year class from having to transfer after only one semester. It would also allow the college to honor financial obligations and provide severance to faculty and staff.

====Efforts to forestall closing====

A group of Sweet Briar alumnae, students, faculty, and supporters united to save the college from closing through legal action, social media and a fundraising campaign, &quot;Saving Sweet Briar&quot;. Saving Sweet Briar, Inc. asserted that the financial decline cited as the reason for closing was overstated or illusory, and sought the resignation of interim President James F. Jones and the board of directors. In a return statement, the President and the Board declined resignation, saying that doing so would &quot;further destabilize an already fragile situation&quot;, and that allegations against them were &quot;wrong and unfair&quot;.

A majority of Sweet Briar faculty members passed a resolution opposing the Board&#x27;s decision to close the college and subsequently issued a vote of no confidence in the school&#x27;s Board and its president. Over 50 tenured and untenured Sweet Briar faculty members later joined a lawsuit against the college, seeking $42 million in damages, reinstatement of employment, and injunctions to prevent the closure of the college and termination of its faculty.

On March 30, 2015, the Amherst County Attorney filed a separate lawsuit, this one on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia, seeking an injunction to block the closing of Sweet Briar College and to force the removal and replacement of the president and board of directors. Following an amicus curiae brief released by Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, who argued that the Amherst County Attorney did not have the standing to seek an injunction, a Bedford County judge ruled that the county attorney had standing to sue under Virginia&#x27;s charitable solicitation law, but not under its trust law. At a hearing on the Amherst County Attorney&#x27;s lawsuit on April 15, 2015, the judge granted a 60-day injunction to prevent the college from shifting endowment money solicited for its continued operation to its closing. The judge did not halt the closing, remove the president and board, require the college to continue operations, or appoint a special fiduciary to review college finances. The college&#x27;s attorney said the college would continue the process of closing, using unrestricted funds.
On April 20, following the decision on the injunction, a group of Sweet Briar students, parents, and alumnae filed a third lawsuit calling the Board decision to close the school a breach of contract. Rather than monetary damages, the suit requested injunctions to prevent the college from taking more steps to shut down or sell assets, and a permanent injunction requiring Sweet Briar to continue operating. The college&#x27;s spokeswoman contested the allegations. After a hearing on April 29, the same Bedford County judge ruled that the college could not sell any of its assets for six months, although he still did not enjoin the closing.

The college embarked on negotiations to transfer some time-sensitive assets despite the court&#x27;s injunction. The parties negotiated an agreement to transfer hazardous chemicals, to sell to faculty their personal computers, and to keep Sweet Briar&#x27;s study abroad program functioning. In adopting the agreed order, the judge declined to allow the transfer of the college&#x27;s horses. On his own, he added to the injunction for the first time a restriction that the college shall &quot;engage in no such act during the period of this injunction that has as its goals facilitating the closing of the college unless such act is authorized by further order of this court&quot;.

On behalf of the Commonwealth, the Amherst County Attorney filed an appeal of the judge&#x27;s April 15 decision on trust law applicability with the Virginia Supreme Court. Following a hearing on June 4, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Commonwealth on June 9, stating that Virginia trust laws can apply to Sweet Briar, and referred the case back to the Bedford county circuit court judge for consideration of a temporary injunction to halt the closing of the college.

====Agreement to keep the college open====
On June 20, 2015, the Virginia Attorney General&#x27;s office announced a mediation agreement to keep Sweet Briar College open for the 2015–16 academic year. The agreement called for Sweet Briar College president James Jones to resign, as well as at least 13 members of the college&#x27;s board of directors to allow Saving Sweet Briar to appoint a new majority. Lawyers for Saving Sweet Briar contacted Phillip Stone, the former president of Bridgewater College, to ask him to serve as Sweet Briar&#x27;s new president. Saving Sweet Briar agreed to contribute $12 million, and the state Attorney General agreed to release restrictions on an additional $16 million of endowment money, to pay for continuing operations. On June 22, 2015, the Bedford County judge approved the agreement, and dismissed the pending lawsuits.

===Revitalization===

====Change of leadership====
Sweet Briar&#x27;s board is historically elected annually in the spring, however Saving Sweet Briar and plaintiffs in the litigations appointed an entirely new board in July 2015. In a conference call vote, the new board unanimously installed Phillip Stone as the new president and formally rescinded the previous board&#x27;s announcement that the school was closing.

Stone announced in newspaper interviews that he did not regard this as an interim or one-year appointment, and that in years to come he intended to increase enrollment beyond Sweet Briar&#x27;s highest past student count. Stone invited most faculty and staff members to remain in their positions; the settlement included paying six months&#x27; severance to any who elected to depart. The settlement required Saving Sweet Briar to deliver $12 million by September 2015 to help cover 2015–16 operating costs. The group met and exceeded its target, providing $12.143 million by September 2 In November 2015 the college finances proved strong enough that the board decided not to draw on the promised $16 million which the court had made available from the endowment, reserving the option to do so later if necessary.

On April 23, 2016, the Board of Directors announced that Stone would be stepping down as the president to allow the Board to appoint a permanent leader. On February 6, 2017, the college announced that Meredith Jung-En Woo would become the 13th president of the college, to be instated on May 15, 2017.

====Academic re-structuring====
Under Woo the college announced a radical departure from the traditional academic curriculum at Sweet Briar for the fall 2018 semester, restructuring it to remove historic academic departments and replace them with three &quot;centers&quot;: Engineering, Science and Technology in Society; Human and Environmental Sustainability; and Creativity, Design and the Arts. The traditional general education requirements was replaced with a new core curriculum program based around women&#x27;s leadership.

Semesters changed from a 15-week system to &quot;3-12-12-3&quot;-week semesters, with the three-week terms allowing for focus on opportunities such as intensive classes, study abroad, and research opportunities.

====Financial status and enrollment====
In January 2016, the college announced that it had received more than 1000 applications for the 2016–2017 academic year and that it did not plan to touch the $16 million of restricted funds initially planned to be released from the endowment by the attorney general.

In June 2018, the regional accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, placed Sweet Briar on &quot;warning&quot; status based on a review of its fiscal-year 2017 finances. The college was required to demonstrate to the accreditor within the subsequent 12 months that its finances were sound and soundly managed, or further action, including revocation of accreditation and loss of federal financial aid, could have followed. In June 2019, the commission lifted the warning status.

==== Admissions policy barring transgender students ====
In August 2024, Sweet Briar&#x27;s leaders announced that the college would not accept transgender students. The Common Application, which Sweet Briar requires applicants to complete, had recently changed to list four possible genders, something the college&#x27;s administrators found unacceptable saying that the change &quot;presents a challenge both for students applying for admission and administrators and staff making admissions decisions&quot;.

College policy now says students can be admitted &quot;if she confirms that her sex assigned at birth is female and that she consistently lives and identifies as a woman&quot;. Before this it just required a birth certificate. Sweet Briar&#x27;s student government association and other campus groups have used social media to criticize the change. On August 26, 2024, the college&#x27;s faculty senate approved a resolution in favor of reversing the new policy, writing that transgender students are &quot;precisely the students who benefit from attending an institution that is historically dedicated to gender equity in a world where women were underserved and undervalued&quot;. John Gregory Brown, chair of the faculty senate, described the new policy as &quot;morally repugnant&quot;.

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, Sweet Briar accepted 75.7% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered difficult and with those enrolled having an average 3.54 high school GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores, Sweet Briar being a test optional school. Those enrolled that submitted test scores had an average 1190 SAT score (22% submitting scores) or average 26 ACT score (15% submitting scores).

==Architecture==

The college&#x27;s architecture is dominated by the work of Ralph Adams Cram, who also lent his architectural expertise to the campuses of Princeton University and West Point, among others. Although Cram&#x27;s forte was Gothic Revival, he designed Sweet Briar in the Colonial Revival style, using red brick buildings with white balustrades and arcades.

Twenty-one of the thirty campus buildings were designated as the &quot;Sweet Briar College Historic District&quot; by the National Register of Historic Places. Sweet Briar House, which traditionally houses the college president, is among these buildings.

The campus property includes the Sweet Briar plantation burial ground (known as the slave cemetery), where upwards of 60 slaves are buried.

Archaeologists have uncovered many slave artifacts on campus. A slave cabin from the 1840s, which was also used for early college employees, is behind Sweet Briar House.

Many of the college&#x27;s faculty and staff live on campus, in homes that they rent or privately own. The land these homes are on belongs to the college.

==Campus life==
Sweet Briar is a residential campus, and nearly all students live on campus. There are seven standard dormitories and additional independent living options for upperclasswomen in the Green Village and Patterson House. The college has over 50 clubs and organizations.

Like other women&#x27;s colleges in the United States, Sweet Briar College has many traditions. The most prominent is the annual Founder&#x27;s Day, when students, faculty and staff walk to Monument Hill to place daisies at Daisy Williams&#x27;s grave site and memorial.

==Athletics==
Sweet Briar athletic teams are the Vixens. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) since the 1982–83 academic year.

Sweet Briar competes in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Women&#x27;s sports include cross country, equestrian, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming and tennis. Fencing is a Sweet Briar club sport.

Students also participate in recreational sports through the Sweet Briar Outdoor Program (SWEBOP), which organizes a number of trips throughout the year. These include hiking, fly fishing, caving, rock climbing and weekly kayaking and skiing.

===Riding===
The college is known for its horseback riding program, which focuses on show and field hunters, hunt seat equitation, and show jumping. The school has seven riding teams. These include a jumper team, a hunter show team, a JV hunter show team, an American National Riding Commission (ANRC) team, a field team and an Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) team. As part of its program, students can study for an Equine Studies Certificate with a focus in training or equine management.
Sweet Briar hosted the 37th Annual ANRC Intercollegiate Equitation Championship judged by George H. Morris in 2014.

Sweet Briar&#x27;s accolades include four ODAC titles (1987, 2012, 2015, 2016), nine ANRC team national championship titles (1978–1980; 1986–1990; 1999), and 10 ANRC team reserve national championships titles (1981–1985; 2000–2002; 2004–2005). Sweet Briar students have been individual national champions nine times, and individual reserve ANRC national champions seven times. In 2006, Sweet Briar&#x27;s IHSA team won their region (Zone 4, Region 1) and placed second at Zones, qualifying the team for the Nationals Competition. The team placed third overall. In 2008, Sweet Briar&#x27;s IHSA team again won their region and proceeded to the Nationals, where team members collected individual ribbons.

<text>Forest Glen is one of the 77 official city community areas of Chicago, Illinois, located on the city&#x27;s Northwest Side. It comprises the neighborhoods of Forest Glen, Edgebrook and Sauganash, with sub-neighborhoods of Sauganash Park, Wildwood, North Edgebrook and Old Edgebrook.

==Neighborhoods==

===Edgebrook===
Edgebrook borders the neighborhood of Sauganash to the west and Forest Glen to the south. Edgebrook was once part of the Sauganash land tract known as Caldwell&#x27;s Reserve, and was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889. To the north of Edgebrook sits Wildwood and then North Edgebrook. Frequently the three communities together are referred to as Edgebrook.

Edgebrook is roughly bordered by I-94 (the Edens Expressway) and the city limits to the east, the forest preserve and Niles to the west, the North Branch of the Chicago River to the south, and the Chicago city limits to the north.

Edgebrook is home to the Billy Caldwell Golf Course and the Edgebrook Golf Course, both operated by the Cook County Forest Preserves, and Edgebrook Elementary School, which has consistently ranked highly among the many Chicago Public Schools in terms of standardized test performance. Edgebrook School&#x27;s mascot is the Eagle.

The codice_1 and codice_2 CTA bus routes serve the Edgebrook neighborhood. The Milwaukee District / North Line also has a stop in Edgebrook.

Additionally, the Edgebrook Branch of the Chicago Public Library system is located on Devon Avenue, in the heart of the Edgebrook neighborhood.

===Old Edgebrook===

Old Edgebrook is a small area located between Central and Devon Avenues and the Edgebrook Golf Course, consisting of several blocks of large, stately homes originally built for railroad executives. The first homes here were built in the 1890s. Today, Old Edgebrook is an historical landmark district, surrounded on all sides by Cook County Forest Preserve land.

===Indian Woods===
Sitting across the river and Central Avenue from Old Edgebrook, Indian Woods (South Edgebrook) is defined by Central Avenue to the west, the Edgebrook Woods Forest Preserve to the north and east, and Elston Avenue to the south. Indian Woods is originally part of the Forest Glen community area, but also located in the northern portion of Jefferson Park. It shares the 60646 (Edgebrook) ZIP Code. There are multiple unique wooden signs marking the Indian Woods community that have been in place for many decades.

===Wildwood===

Part of Edgebrook, the Wildwood community is triangular in shape and is bordered by Lehigh Avenue, Caldwell Avenue (Route 14), Mendota Avenue, and Lightfoot Avenue. Wildwood Elementary School (affiliated with the Chicago Public Schools) serves parts of Edgebrook (west of Lehigh), Wildwood and North Edgebrook, and is highly rated. The Edgebrook Metra train station is located a little south of Wildwood near the intersection of Devon, Lehigh, and Caldwell Avenues.

====North Edgebrook====
North Edgebrook is the section of Edgebrook sitting north of Wildwood. Its northern border is Touhy Avenue, except for a small area consisting of a couple of blocks that extends north of Touhy Avenue, and is surrounded by the suburb of Niles.

===Sauganash===

Sauganash was once part of the Sauganash land tract (Caldwell&#x27;s Reserve) and was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889. This neighborhood is named after Billy Caldwell, also known as Sauganash (meaning &quot;English speaking&quot;). Born to a Mohawk mother and an Irish father, William Caldwell Sr., a Captain of the British Butler Rangers, he became a leader of the Potawotomi. The &quot;Treaty Elm&quot; which stood until the 1930s was originally used in the first and second government surveys of the reserve. Sauganash negotiated with the United States on behalf of the United Nations of the Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawotomi. In return for his services, the US gave him 1600 acres on the Chicago River.

Today the neighborhood is home to three churches: Sauganash Community Church, a non-denominational Protestant church; Bride of Christ Church; and Queen of All Saints, a Roman Catholic Basilica. The Sauganash residential neighborhood has many distinctive homes. It also had large tracts of prairie land until the mid-1950s.

The Sauganash neighborhood is bordered by Devon Avenue to the north, Bryn Mawr Avenue to the south, the Edens Expressway (Interstate 94) to the west, and Pulaski Road to the east. Devon Avenue marks the northern boundary of the city limits of Chicago at this point. The suburb of Lincolnwood begins north of Devon Avenue.

The neighborhood of Sauganash Park lies east of the Valley Line trail.

The North side of Sauganash which is north of Peterson Avenue is considered to be a safe area, however due to the biker gangs on the south side of Peterson the crime is increased.

LaBagh Woods forest preserve is directly south of Sauganash.

===Forest Glen===
A community of about 550 residences on the far Northwest side of the city of Chicago is often referred to as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Finest Community.&quot; It is one of the oldest neighborhoods on the Northwest side, and is at the southern part of the official Chicago neighborhood&#x27;s area of Forest Glen, which also contains Edgebrook and Sauganash. The first European American to settle Forest Glen was Civil War hero Captain William Hazelton of the 1st Cavalry Division. Captain Hazelton built a home in Forest Glen which still stands, and started a Sunday School that evolved into the First Congregational Church of Forest Glen. Hazelton also built the Glen&#x27;s first barn at what is now Lawler and Elston.

The Forest Glen neighborhood is bordered by the Chicago River to the north, Foster Avenue to the south, Cicero Avenue to the east and Metra Milwaukee District North line to the west. Forest Glen shares its ZIP Code (60630) with Jefferson Park.

===South Edgebrook===
The area commonly known as South Edgebrook was originally in the Forest Glen community area, but now straddles the official Chicago neighborhoods of Jefferson Park and Norwood Park. South Edgebrook&#x27;s borders are considered to be Devon Avenue to the north, Metra tracks and the Edgebrook Golf Course / Forest Preserve to the east, and Elston Avenue and Milwaukee Avenue to the south and west. It is served by the 60646 (Edgebrook) ZIP Code. In recent years, Internet and atlas maps of Chicago&#x27;s neighborhoods indicate a &quot;South Edgebrook&quot; located south of Caldwell Avenue and west of the Edens (I-94) Expressway by the Billy Caldwell Golf Course. This area, however, is part of Edgebrook itself, and never had any additional designation.

== Politics ==
Forest Glen has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Forest Glen cast 5,753 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 3,344 votes for Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, Forest Glen cast 5,273 votes for Barack Obama and cast 3,592 votes for Mitt Romney.

==Transportation==

Metra provides service to Union Station from two stops in Forest Glen on the Milwaukee District / North Line. Forest Glen station lies between Forest Glen and Elston Avenues, while Edgebrook station lies just to the north of the intersection of Caldwell, Devon, and Central Avenues. The southern part of Forest Glen is also accessible from the Union Pacific / Northwest Line&#x27;s stops in and Gladstone Park. The Blue Line also serves Jefferson Park, providing service to , downtown, and .

The Edens Expressway (I-94) has a number of interchanges in Forest Glen: in Edgebrook at Caldwell Avenue; at Touhy Avenue just outside Edgebrook/Forest Glen&#x27;s boundaries in Lincolnwood; just outside Forest Glen north to the North Shore suburbs and Milwaukee via the Foster Avenue on-ramp; and again just outside Forest Glen south to down town via the Elston Avenue on-ramp, just one city block south of Foster Avenue.

<doc id="1317567" wikidata="Q409591" url="?curid=1317567" title="Vinyl alcohol">
<text>Vinyl alcohol, also called ethenol (IUPAC name; not ethanol) or ethylenol, is the simplest enol. With the formula , it is a labile compound that converts to acetaldehyde immediately upon isolation near room temperature. It is not a practical precursor to any compound.
==Synthesis==
Vinyl alcohol can be formed by the pyrolytic elimination of water from ethylene glycol at a temperature of 900 °C and low pressure. Such processes are of no practical importance.

==Tautomerization of vinyl alcohol to acetaldehyde==
Under normal conditions, vinyl alcohol converts (tautomerizes) to acetaldehyde:

At room temperature, acetaldehyde () is more stable than vinyl alcohol () by 42.7 kJ/mol. Vinyl alcohol gas isomerizes to the aldehyde with a half-life of 30 min at room temperature.

The uncatalyzed keto–enol tautomerism by a 1,3-hydrogen migration is forbidden by the Woodward–Hoffmann rules and therefore has a high activation barrier and is not a significant pathway at or near room temperature. However, even trace amounts of acids or bases (including water) can catalyze the reaction. Even with rigorous precautions to minimize adventitious moisture or proton sources, vinyl alcohol can only be stored for minutes to hours before it isomerizes to acetaldehyde. (Carbonic acid is another example of a substance that is stable when rigorously pure, but decomposes rapidly due to catalysis by trace moisture.)

The tautomerization can also be catalyzed via photochemical process. These findings suggest that the keto–enol tautomerization is a viable route under atmospheric and stratospheric conditions, relevant to a role for vinyl alcohol in the production of organic acids in the atmosphere.

Vinyl alcohol can be stabilized by controlling the water concentration in the system and utilizing the kinetic favorability of the deuterium-produced kinetic isotope effect (&quot;k&quot;H+/&quot;k&quot;D+ = 4.75, &quot;k&quot;H2O/&quot;k&quot;D2O = 12). Deuterium stabilization can be accomplished through hydrolysis of a ketene precursor in the presence of a slight stoichiometric excess of heavy water (D2O). Studies show that the tautomerization process is significantly inhibited at ambient temperatures ( &quot;k&quot;t ≈ 10−6 M/s), and the half-life of the enol form can easily be increased to &quot;t&quot;1/2 = 42 minutes for first-order hydrolysis kinetics.

==Relationship to poly(vinyl alcohol)==
Because of the instability of vinyl alcohol, the thermoplastic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA or PVOH) is made indirectly by polymerization of vinyl acetate followed by hydrolysis of the ester bonds (Ac = acetyl; HOAc = acetic acid):
:

==As a ligand==
Several metal complexes are known that contain vinyl alcohol as a ligand. One example is Pt(acac)(η2-C2H3OH)Cl.

==Occurrence in interstellar medium==
Vinyl alcohol was detected in the molecular cloud Sagittarius B in 2001, the last of the three stable isomers of (after acetaldehyde and ethylene oxide) to be detected in space. Its stability in the (dilute) interstellar medium shows that its tautomerization does not happen unimolecularly, a fact attributed to the size of the activation energy barrier to the rearrangement being insurmountable at temperatures present in interstellar space. The vinyl alcohol to acetaldehyde rearrangement is the only keto-enol tautomerisation to have been detected in deep space, induced by the provision of secondary electrons from galactic cosmic rays.

<doc id="1317570" wikidata="Q5562819" url="?curid=1317570" title="Gin pahit">
<text>Gin pahit is an alcoholic drink made with gin and Angostura bitters, as enjoyed in colonial Malaya and generally associated with British colonial era. The name means &quot;bitter gin&quot; in Malay. 

The recipe, according to the food and beverage service of the Raffles Hotel, is 1½ ounces of gin and ½ ounce of Angostura bitters. At least one book on drinks from the 1930s describes it as identical to a pink gin, which would imply considerably less bitters.

It was referred to by the writer W. Somerset Maugham. For example, his short story, &quot;P. &amp; O.&quot; (Copyright 1926), Maugham&#x27;s character Gallagher, an Irishman who had lived in the Federated Malay States for 25 years, orders the drink. Gin pahit appears in several other Maugham stories, including &quot;The Yellow Streak&quot;, set in Borneo, &quot;Footprints in the Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Book-Bag&quot; and &quot;The Letter&quot; all set in Malaya, in &quot;The Outstation&quot; (Two Malay boys..., came in, one bearing gin pahits..), and in the novel &quot;The Narrow Corner&quot; (opening line of Chapter xviii).

Maugham himself spent many years in Maritime Southeast Asia and was acquainted with the drink from his travels. He refers to gin pahit in the opening pages of his 1930 travelogue &quot;The Gentleman in the Parlour&quot; (Chapter iii). The Raffles Long Bar in Singapore listed gin pahit on the cocktail board as late as 1985 but other references to pink gins are correct – a traditional Royal Navy drink (&quot;..one had no ice, d&#x27;you see?&quot;) of gin and bitters where the bitters were added to the glass first and the barman would then ask &quot;In or Out, Sir?&quot;

The drink is also mentioned by Captain Biggar in &quot;The Return of Jeeves&quot; by P.G. Wodehouse.

David A. Embury states that this drink is made with yellow gin and 3 dashes of Angostura bitters to 2 dashes of absinthe, in &quot;The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot;.

<text> (; ) is a dessert popular in Brazil that is similar to a marshmallow. &#x27;s base ingredients are sugar, gelatin and egg whites. It is usually covered in grated coconut and made without the addition of any other flavors, although there are variations. 

The dessert was created by Antonio Bergamo, a Brazilian candy maker of Italian descent. While trying to use leftover egg whites, he managed to make a firm meringue and decided to add gelatin to it. After the meringue was cool, he noted that it hadn&#x27;t gotten as firm as he expected, and called it (&quot;soft&quot; or &quot;limp&quot; Mary).

<doc id="1317581" wikidata="Q586956" url="?curid=1317581" title="Jacques Lecoq">
<text>Jacques Lecoq (15 December 1921 – 19 January 1999) was a French stage actor and acting movement coach. He was best known for his teaching methods in physical theatre, movement, and mime which he taught at the school he founded in Paris known as École internationale de théâtre Jacques Lecoq. He taught there from 1956 until his death from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1999.

Jacques Lecoq was known as the only noteworthy movement instructor and theatre pedagogue with a professional background in sports and sports rehabilitation in the twentieth century.

==Life==
As a teenager, Lecoq participated in many sports such as running, swimming, and gymnastics. Lecoq was particularly drawn to gymnastics. He began learning gymnastics at the age of seventeen, and through work on the parallel bars and horizontal bar, he came to see and understand the geometry of movement. Lecoq described the movement of the body through space as required by gymnastics to be purely abstract. He came to understand the rhythms of athletics as a kind of physical poetry that affected him strongly. Following many of his exercise sessions, Lecoq found it important to think back on his period of exercise and the various routines that he had performed and felt that doing so bettered his mind and emotions. In 1937 Lecoq began to study sports and physical education at Bagatelle college just outside of Paris. He received teaching degrees in swimming and athletics. In 1941, Lecoq attended a physical theatre college where he met Jean Marie Conty, a basketball player of international caliber, who was in charge of physical education in all of France. Conty&#x27;s interest in the link between sport and theatre had come out of a friendship with Antonin Artaud and Jean-Louis Barrault, both well-known actors and directors and founders of Education par le Jeu Dramatique (&quot;Education through the Dramatic Game&quot;). While Lecoq still continued to teach physical education for several years, he soon found himself acting as a member of the &quot;Comediens de Grenoble&quot;. While Lecoq was a part of this company he learned a great deal about Jacques Copeau&#x27;s techniques in training. One of these techniques that really influenced Lecoq&#x27;s work was the concept of natural gymnastics. This company and his work with Commedia dell&#x27;arte in Italy (where he lived for eight years) introduced him to ideas surrounding mime, masks and the physicality of performance. During this time he also performed with the actor, playwright, and clown, Dario Fo.

He was first introduced to theatre and acting by Jacques Copeau&#x27;s daughter Marie-Hélène and her husband, Jean Dasté.

In 1956, he returned to Paris to open his school, École Internationale de théâtre Jacques Lecoq, where he spent most of his time until his death, filling in as international speaker and master class giver for the Union of Theatres of Europe. The school was eventually relocated to Le Central in 1976. The building was previously a boxing center and was where Francisco Amoros, a huge proponent of physical education, developed his own gymnastic method. Lecoq chose this location because of the connections he had with his early career in sports. The school was also located on the same street that Jacques Copeau was born.

==Teaching style/method==
Lecoq aimed at training his actors in ways that encouraged them to investigate ways of performance that suited them best. His training was aimed at nurturing the creativity of the performer, as opposed to giving them a codified set of skills. As students stayed with Lecoq&#x27;s school longer, he accomplished this through teaching in the style of &quot;via negativa&quot;, also known as the negative way. This teaching strategy basically consists of only focusing his critiques on the poorer or unacceptable aspects of a student&#x27;s performance. Lecoq believed that this would allow students to discover on their own how to make their performances more acceptable. Lecoq did not want to ever tell a student how to do something &quot;right.&quot; He believed that was supposed to be a part of the actor&#x27;s own experience. The goal was to encourage the student to keep trying new avenues of creative expression.
Many actors sought Lecoq&#x27;s training initially because Lecoq provided methods for people who wished to create their own work and did not want to only work out of a playwright&#x27;s text. 

His training involved an emphasis on masks, starting with the neutral mask. This neutral mask is symmetrical, the brows are soft, and the mouth is made to look ready to perform any action. Lecoq believed that this mask allowed his students to be open when performing and to fully let the world affect their bodies. This is because the mask is made to seem as if it has no past and no previous knowledge of how the world works. This is supposed to allow students to live in a state of unknowing in their performance. The aim was that the neutral mask can aid an awareness of physical mannerisms as they get greatly emphasized to an audience whilst wearing the mask. 

Once Lecoq&#x27;s students became comfortable with the neutral masks, he would move on to working with them with larval masks, expressive masks, the commedia masks, half masks, gradually working towards the smallest mask in his repertoire: the clown&#x27;s red nose. The larval mask was used as a didactic tool for Lecoq&#x27;s students to escape the confines of realism and inject free imagination into the performance. The mask is essentially a blank slate, amorphous shape, with no specific characterizations necessarily implied. The expressive masks are basically character masks that are depicting a very particular of character with a specific emotion or reaction. The mask is automatically associated with conflict. 

The last mask in the series is the red clown nose which is the last step in the student&#x27;s process. Because this nose acts as a tiny, neutral mask, this step is often the most challenging and personal for actors. Lecoq believed that every person would develop their own personal clown at this step. He believed that to study the clown is to study oneself, thus no two selves are alike. Three of the principal skills that he encouraged in his students were &quot;le jeu&quot; (playfulness), &quot;complicité&quot; (togetherness) and &quot;disponibilité&quot; (openness). 

The French concept of &#x27;efficace&#x27; suggesting at once efficiency and effectiveness of movement was highly emphasized by Lecoq. Lecoq viewed movement as a sort of zen art of making simple, direct, minimal movements that nonetheless carried significant communicative depth. Lecoq emphasizes that his students should respect the old, traditional form of commedia dell&#x27;arte. But Lecoq was no period purist. He believed commedia was a tool to combine physical movement with vocal expression. He emphasized the importance of finding the most fitting voice for each actor&#x27;s mask, and he believed that there was room for reinvention and play in regards to traditional commedia dell&#x27;arte conventions.

One of the most essential aspects of Lecoq&#x27;s teaching style involves the relationship of the performer to the audience. Lecoq thus placed paramount importance on insuring a thorough understanding of a performance&#x27;s message on the part of its spectators. In this way Lecoq&#x27;s instruction encouraged an intimate relationship between the audience and the performer. Lecoq&#x27;s pedagogy has yielded diverse cohorts of students with a wide range of creative impulses and techniques.

In collaboration with the architect Krikor Belekian he also set up le Laboratoire d&#x27;Étude du Mouvement (Laboratory for the study of movement; L.E.M. for short) in 1977. This was a separate department within the school which looked at architecture, scenography and stage design and its links to movement.

Lecoq wrote on the art and philosophy of mimicry and miming. Therein he traces mime-like behavior to early childhood development stages, positing that mimicry is a vital behavioral process in which individuals come to know and grasp the world around them. Lecoq also wrote on the subject of gesture specifically and its philosophical relation to meaning, viewing the art of gesture as a linguistic system of sorts in and of itself. Lecoq classifies gestures into three major groups: gestures of action, expression, and demonstration.

In 1999, filmmakers Jean-Noël Roy and Jean-Gabriel Carasso released &quot;Les Deux Voyages de Jacques Lecoq&quot;, a film documenting two years of training at École internationale de théâtre Jacques Lecoq. The documentary includes footage of Lecoq working with students at his Paris theatre school in addition to numerous interviews with some of his most well-known, former pupils.

<doc id="1317582" wikidata="Q6651160" url="?curid=1317582" title="Little Nicky (cat)">
<text>Little Nicky (born October 17, 2004) is the first commercially produced clone of a cat. He was produced from the DNA of a 17-year-old Maine Coon cat named Nicky who died in 2003. Little Nicky&#x27;s owner, a north Texas woman named Julie (whose last name was not released) paid $50,000 to have Nicky cloned. Little Nicky&#x27;s owner reported that the cat shared many characteristics with his predecessor, including a similar personality and appearance.

==Origin and cloning==
The cloning of Little Nicky was performed by the California-based company Genetic Savings &amp; Clone, which later closed in 2006. This followed the first successful cloning of a cat by the company in conjunction with Texas A&amp;M University. The cloning was performed by the chromatin transfer technique, a variant of nuclear transfer. The cloning of Little Nicky was a result of an offer by the company called the &quot;Nine Lives Extravaganza&quot; launched in 2004.

==Ethical controversy==
Groups such as the Humane Society of the United States, the Best Friends Animal Society, and other groups for animal welfare spoke out against the creation of pet clones such as Little Nicky. They emphasized that the $50,000 invested in the cloning of animals could be utilized for the care of existing animals in shelters, or invested in programs for spaying and neutering homeless shelter pet populations.

Little Nicky reportedly had health problems during his life. These health problems were not proven to be related to the cloning process. His owner claims that the original Nicky never had the health problems that the clone had. The company that cloned Little Nicky believes that his health issues were acquired and not genetic.

<text>A master class is a class given to students of a particular discipline by an expert of that discipline—usually music, but also science, painting, drama, games, or on any other occasion where skills are being developed.

&quot;Masterclass&quot; is also used in a figurative sense to describe a display of great skill in a context where education was not the primary intention; e.g., &quot;his last few laps were a &quot;masterclass&quot; in overtaking&quot; (referencing a race around a track).

== Around music ==
The difference between a normal class and a &quot;master class&quot; is typically the setup. In a master class, all the students (and often spectators) watch and listen as the master takes one student at a time. The student (typically intermediate or advanced, depending on the status of the master) usually performs a single piece which they have prepared, and the master will give them advice on how to play it, often including anecdotes about the composer, demonstrations of how to play certain passages, and admonitions of common technical errors. The student is then usually expected to play the piece again, in light of the master&#x27;s comments, and the student may be asked to play a passage repeatedly to attain perfection. Master classes for musical instruments tend to focus on the finer details of attack, tone, phrasing, and overall shape, and the student is expected to have complete control of more basic elements such as rhythm and pitch. The value of the master class setup is that all students can benefit from the master&#x27;s comments on each piece.

Many concert performers have given master classes, starting with its inventor Franz Liszt and including such greats as Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, and Vladimir Horowitz. Often, a touring performer will give a master class the day before, or the day of, their performance in a particular city. Giving a master class before a concert provides both artistic stimulation for the performer and a means of obtaining a larger audience.

Aspiring classical musicians, and their teachers, typically consider master classes to be one of the most effective means of musical development, along with competitions, examinations, and practice.

Some musical theatre composers will also give master classes to college students studying performance.

Some speciality classes may be referred to as &#x27;mini master classes&#x27;. These can involve short, faster lessons on a new subject. Students, typically experienced in one discipline, may attend these classes to learn the basics of a new, related discipline.

==History==

In 1884, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, delivered twenty lectures on molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light. In their 1987 book &quot;Kelvin&#x27;s Baltimore Lectures and Modern Theoretical Physics: historical and philosophical perspectives&quot;, Robert Kargon and Peter Achinstein write that the sessions, which were held in a small lecture hall, were conducted as &quot;master classes&quot;. The tone was conversational and informal; Kelvin made almost no use of notes ... Usually Kelvin lectured from one of these standpoints, then engaged the audience in a discussion of the details, then shifted to another of the standpoints for the second part of the lecture. They explain:

The attendees were expected to have advanced knowledge of physics and mathematics. Among them were British physicists Lord Rayleigh and George Forbes; Professors Kikuchi and Fujioka of Japan; American instructors in physics from eastern and western colleges, including Albert Michelson and Edward Morley; attendees from Canada, Germany, and Russia; and Hopkins faculty and students including Rowland, Thomas Craig, Fabian Franklin, Henry Crew, Gustav Liebig, Joseph Sweetman Ames, and Christine Ladd Franklin.

A record of the twenty classes was made by A. S. Hathaway and circulated afterwards using papyrograph stencil duplication. It is these notes that were reproduced in 1987 for the publication sponsored by Johns Hopkins Center for the History and Philosophy of Science. In fact Hathaway continued to correspond with Kelvin, who supplemented the notes, and the &quot;Lectures&quot; were eventually broadly circulated in 1904.

<doc id="1317602" wikidata="Q15514842" url="?curid=1317602" title="Alan Taylor (historian)">
<text>Alan Shaw Taylor (born June 17, 1955) is an American historian and scholar who, most recently, was the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation Professor of History at the University of Virginia. A specialist in the early history of the United States, Taylor has written extensively about the colonial history of the United States, the American Revolution, and the early American Republic. Taylor has received two Pulitzer Prizes and the Bancroft Prize, and was also a finalist for the National Book Award for non-fiction. In 2020 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Education==
Taylor was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Ruel Taylor, Jr. and author Virginia C. Taylor. He graduated from Colby College, in Waterville, Maine, in 1977, and earned his PhD from Brandeis University in 1986.

==Career==
Before going to the University of Virginia, Taylor taught previously at the University of California, Davis and Boston University.

Taylor is best known for his contributions to microhistory, exemplified in his &quot;William Cooper&#x27;s Town: Power and Persuasion on the Frontier of the Early American Republic&quot; (1996). Using court records, land records, letters and diaries, Taylor reconstructed the background of founder William Cooper from Burlington, New Jersey, and the economic, political and social history related to the land speculation, founding and settlement of Cooperstown, New York, after the American Revolutionary War.

Taylor is among a generation of historians committed to the revival of narrative history, incorporating many historical methods (political, social, cultural, and environmental, among others) to understand humans&#x27; experiences of the past.

Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution&quot; (2006) explored the history of the borders between Canada and the United States in the aftermath of the American Revolution, as well as Iroquois attempts to keep control of some lands. His book &quot;The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, &amp; Indian Allies&quot; (2010) also addressed this borderland area and strategies pursued by various groups. The War of 1812 has also been characterized as a continuation of the Revolutionary War.

In the list of multiple Pulitzer Prize winners, Taylor is one of five authors to have twice been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History.

Contributing to the anthology &quot;Our American Story&quot; (2019), Taylor addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and offered a skeptical approach, arguing, &quot;There is no single unifying narrative linking past and present in America. Instead, we have enduring divisions in a nation even larger and more diverse than that of 1787. The best we can do today is to cope with our differences by seeking compromises, just as the Founders had to do, painfully and incompletely in the early Republic.&quot;

<doc id="1317604" wikidata="Q1140085" url="?curid=1317604" title="Crimson Tide (film)">
<text>Crimson Tide is a 1995 American submarine action thriller film directed by Tony Scott and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It takes place during a period of political turmoil in Russia, in which ultranationalists threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the United States and Japan.

The film focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned commanding officer of a U.S. nuclear missile submarine (Gene Hackman) and his new executive officer (Denzel Washington), arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The story parallels a real incident during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Hans Zimmer, who scored the film, won a Grammy Award for the main theme, which heavily uses synthesizers instead of traditional orchestral instruments. An extended cut, which incorporates seven minutes of deleted scenes, was released on DVD in 2006, while the 2008 Blu-ray release only includes the theatrical version.

==Plot==
In post-Soviet Russia, civil war erupts as a result of the ongoing conflict in Chechnya. Military units loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, a Russian ultra-nationalist rebel, take control of a nuclear missile installation and threaten nuclear war if confronted.

USS &quot;Alabama&quot;, a U.S. Navy submarine, is dispatched on patrol with orders to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike if Radchenko fuels his missiles. Combat-hardened veteran Captain Frank Ramsey chooses Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, who has an extensive education in military history and tactics but no combat experience, as his new XO.

Tensions arise between the headstrong Ramsey and the more analytical and cautious Hunter, exacerbated by Ramsey&#x27;s decision to order a missile drill amidst the chaos caused by a galley fire that results in the death of the chief mess officer. Hunter helps fight the fire and discreetly questions the decision but is chastised by Ramsey for the appearance of discord.

&quot;Alabama&quot; receives an Emergency Action Message ordering missile launch against the Russian base. As &quot;Alabama&quot; prepares to fire, a second radio message is detected before a rebel Russian &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarine attacks, damaging the ship&#x27;s radio and leaving the message incomplete.

With the last confirmed order being to launch, Ramsey decides to proceed. Hunter disagrees, believing the partial second message may be a retraction. When Hunter refuses to consent as is required, Ramsey tries to relieve him of duty. Hunter orders Ramsey arrested for attempting to circumvent two-man protocol. The Chief of the Boat sides with Hunter and has Ramsey relieved of command and confined to his stateroom, putting Hunter in charge.

The Russian submarine attacks &quot;Alabama&quot; again. &quot;Alabama&quot; emerges victorious but is damaged when a torpedo detonates next to its hull. The main propulsion system is disabled, and the bilge bay begins flooding. As the crew tries to restore propulsion, Hunter orders the sealing of the bilge with sailors trapped inside, saving &quot;Alabama&quot; at the expense of the men. Propulsion is restored before &quot;Alabama&quot; reaches hull-crush depth.

Officers and crew loyal to Ramsey unite and stage a mutiny. They retake the control room, confining Hunter, the Chief of the Boat, and some others to the officers&#x27; mess. Repairs to the radio continue, but Ramsey is determined to proceed without waiting for verification. Hunter escapes his arrest and prepares to retake the ship. He gains the support of weapons officer Peter Ince in the missile control room, further delaying the launch and leading Ramsey to go there. Hunter&#x27;s party storms &quot;Alabama&quot;&#x27;s command center, removing the captain&#x27;s missile key. Ramsey and his men return, resulting in an armed Mexican standoff. With news that the radio will soon be repaired, Ramsey and Hunter agree to wait until the deadline for a preemptive missile launch to be effective.

Communications are eventually restored, revealing the full message from the second transmission – a retraction ordering that the missile launch be aborted because Radchenko&#x27;s rebellion has been quelled. Ramsey turns the conn over to Hunter and returns to his cabin.

The two men are put before a tribunal at Naval Station Pearl Harbor to answer for their actions. The tribunal concludes that both men were right and both men were wrong, and Hunter&#x27;s actions were deemed lawfully justified and in the best interests of the United States. Unofficially, the tribunal reprimands both men for failing to resolve their differences. Thanks to Ramsey&#x27;s personal recommendation, the tribunal agrees to grant Hunter command of his own sub while allowing Ramsey to save face via an early retirement with full honors. Outside, Hunter meets with Ramsey to express his gratitude, and the two men part ways amicably.

A textual epilogue states that as of January 1996, only the President has the authority to launch nuclear missiles.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
In 1993, the United States Navy allowed studio executives researching the movie to embark aboard Trident submarine from Bangor, Washington, with the Gold Crew. Those embarked included Hollywood Pictures president of production Ricardo Mestres, director Tony Scott, producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, screenwriter Michael Schiffer, and writer Richard Henrick. While aboard, the Navy allowed the film crew to videotape &quot;Florida&quot;″s Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander William Toti, performing many of the same actions (Executive Officer&#x27;s response to fire, flooding, missile launch sequence, etc.) that actor Denzel Washington eventually performed as executive officer in the movie.

The Navy had been led to believe that the movie&#x27;s storyline was about a Trident ballistic missile submarine crew attempting to stop the ship&#x27;s fictional computer from launching nuclear missiles and starting World War III. In movie parlance, the Navy was told the story would be &quot;&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; meets &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.&quot; The Navy wanted the &quot;Florida&quot; crew to prove to the studio executives that &quot;there is no computer on a Trident submarine that can launch missiles; hence the storyline is implausible.

Following the at-sea walk-through and missile launch demonstration, &quot;Florida&quot; returned to port to drop off the studio executives. During that transit, Toti spent much time in the ship&#x27;s wardroom with the studio executives, walking them through the missile launch redundancy procedures. A few months later, the studio returned to the Navy with the revised storyline, and the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Hunter (the character played by Denzel Washington), was now leading a mutiny against the commanding officer to prevent a missile launch.

The film has uncredited additional writing by Quentin Tarantino, much of it being the pop-culture-reference-laden dialogue. Tarantino had an on-set feud with Denzel Washington during filming over what was called &quot;Tarantino&#x27;s racist dialogue added to the script&quot;. A few years later, Washington apologized to Tarantino, saying he &quot;buried that hatchet&quot;.

===Filming===
Filming took place in 1994. In the end, the Navy objected to many of the elements in the script—particularly mutiny on board a U.S. naval vessel—and as such, the film was produced without the Navy&#x27;s assistance. The French Navy assisted the team for production with the use of the aircraft carrier . The dockside scene in which Captain Ramsey addresses the crew with &quot;Alabama&quot; in the background and the crew then runs on board actually features . The sail (&quot;conning tower&quot;) was a plywood mock-up since &quot;Barbel&#x27;s&quot; sail had been removed. &quot;Barbel&quot; had been sold by the U.S. Navy and was in the process of being scrapped.

Because the Navy refused to cooperate with the filming, the production company could not secure footage of a submarine submerging. After checking to ensure there was no law against filming naval vessels, the producers waited at the submarine base at Pearl Harbor until a submarine was put to sea. After a submarine (coincidentally, the real USS &quot;Alabama&quot;) left port, they pursued her in a boat and helicopter, filming as they went. They continued to do so until she submerged, giving them the footage they needed to incorporate into the film.

===Music===
The musical score for &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; was composed by Hans Zimmer and employs a blend of orchestra, choir, and synthesizer sounds. It includes additional music by Nick Glennie-Smith, who also conducted the orchestra, and the choir was conducted by Harry Gregson-Williams. It was released on physical formats on May 16, 1995, by Hollywood Records. Within the score is the well-known naval hymn, &quot;Eternal Father, Strong to Save&quot;. The score won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television, and Zimmer has described it as one of his personal favorites.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Crimson Tide&quot; earned $18.6 million in the United States on its opening weekend, ranked #1 for all films released that week. Overall, it earned $91 million in the U.S. and an additional $66 million internationally, for $157.3 million.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of 53 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.5/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; finds director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;This is the rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while they&#x27;re watching it, but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues,&quot; and ultimately gave the film three and a half stars out of four. Meanwhile, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Crimson Tide&quot; has everything you could want from an action thriller and a few other things you usually can&#x27;t hope to expect.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;what makes &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; a riveting pop drama is the way the conflict comes to the fore in the battle between two men. ... The end of the world may be around the corner, but what holds us is the sight of two superlatively fierce actors working at the top of their game.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;Crimson Tide&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Film Editing (Chris Lebenzon), Sound (Kevin O&#x27;Connell, Rick Kline, Gregory H. Watkins and William B. Kaplan) and Sound Editing (George Watters II), but lost to &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot; simultaneously.

==Historical parallels==
&quot;Crimson Tide&quot; parallels events that occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis onboard Soviet submarine &quot;B-59&quot;, with Denzel Washington&#x27;s character reflecting Soviet second-in-command Vasily Arkhipov.

==Influence==
Robert S. Mueller, in his years as FBI Director, often quoted a line by Gene Hackman&#x27;s character Captain Ramsey in his meetings with the senior leadership of the FBI: &quot;We&#x27;re here to preserve democracy, not to practice it.&quot;

<text>The Canadian five-dollar note is the lowest denomination and one of the most common banknotes of the Canadian dollar.

As with all modern Canadian banknotes, all text is in both English and French .

==Frontier series note==

The most recent Canadian five-dollar note, part of the Frontier series, is predominantly blue and was introduced 7 November 2013, using the same technology found in the other notes of that series. The bill features a portrait of Canada&#x27;s seventh prime minister, Wilfrid Laurier, and a hologram of the Mackenzie Tower from the West Block on Parliament Hill on the front; the back features an astronaut working with Dextre attached to the Canadarm2.

This note features raised, textured printing as well as a special tactile feature (similar to Braille dots) to assist the blind in identifying the denomination. Security features include &quot;Bank of Canada&quot; and &quot;&quot; visible only under ultraviolet light, and yellow dots representing the EURion constellation on the reverse side.

== Canadian Journey note ==
The front of the previous note, from the Canadian Journey series, also features Wilfrid Laurier, the coat of arms, and a picture of the West Block of the Parliament buildings, but in a different layout from the Frontier series note. The reverse side depicts children engaged in winter sports, including sledding, ice skating, and hockey; this is accompanied by a quotation from Roch Carrier&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;:

The winters of my childhood were long, long seasons. We lived in three places—the school, the church and the skating rink—but our real life was on the skating rink.

In the image, one of the hockey players, notably a girl, wears a hockey sweater number 9 to honour Canadian hockey legend Maurice Richard, idolized in Carrier&#x27;s story.

==Series history==
==Five-dollar coin==
In 2005, the Canadian government polled its citizens on the idea of retiring the five-dollar note, replacing it with a five-dollar coin. The money saved in making the coin would then fund the Canadian Olympic team. Canadians resoundingly rejected and ridiculed the idea of a five-dollar coin. Some pointed out the note&#x27;s most recent redesign took place only four years prior, while many others were averse to the idea of carrying yet another coin in their wallets and pockets. Due to the overwhelmingly negative response, plans for the five-dollar coin were discarded. Instead, on 15 November 2006, the Bank of Canada released an updated version of the five-dollar note (issue of 2006) with updated security features, including a holographic stripe found in the rest of the series, and a watermark of Laurier that appears when held to the light. These features replaced the iridescent maple leaves that were in the issue of 2002.

==&quot;Spocking Fives&quot;==

For years, Canadians have been known to deface certain editions of the five-dollar note by using ink pens to alter Laurier&#x27;s features to resemble Spock, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; character originally portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. In 2002, the Bank of Canada officially objected to &quot;any mutilation or defacement of banknotes&quot;, which could shorten the lifespan of the currency. When &quot;Spocking&quot; surged in 2015 following Nimoy&#x27;s death, the Bank reminded people that, while the practice is not illegal and the notes remain legal tender and &quot;a symbol of our country and a source of national pride&quot;, defacing the bill could damage its security features and lead retailers to refuse them. The 2013 issue of the note features an image of Laurier with less resemblance to Spock.

==Polymer notes==
In 2020, a short-list of eight &quot;bank NOTE-able&quot; Canadians to be portrayed on the $5 vertical polymer bills in place of Laurier was selected from 600 nominees: Terry Fox, Crowfoot, Pitseolak Ashoona, Robertine Barry, Binaaswi, Won Alexander Cumyow, Lotta Hitschmanova and Fred Loft, with the final decision to be made by the Minister of Finance. In 2023, it was reported that Laurier will stay on the five-dollar bill for some time. On December 16, 2024, it was announced that the image of Terry Fox would be replacing Laurier&#x27;s image on the next edition of the $5 banknote, with an image of Laurier being used for the $50 note when a new design of that note is implemented.

<text>Jacques Émile Massu (; 5 May 1908 – 26 October 2002) was a French general who fought in World War II, the First Indochina War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. He led French troops in the Battle of Algiers, first supporting and later denouncing their use of torture.

==Early life==
Jacques Massu was born in Châlons-sur-Marne to a family of military officers; his father was an artillery officer. He studied successively at Saint-Louis de Gonzague in Paris, the Free College of Gien (1919–1925) and Prytanée National Militaire (1926–1928). He then entered Saint-Cyr and graduated in 1930 as a second lieutenant in the promotion class &quot;Marshal Foch&quot; and chose the Colonial Infantry.

Between October, 1930 and August, 1931, he served in the 16th Senegalese Tirailleur Regiment (16th RTS) in Cahors. He was sent to Morocco with the 5th RTS and took part in the fighting around Tafilalt where he earned his first citation. He was promoted to lieutenant in October 1932 and took part in the operations in High Atlas, earning a new citation.

In 1934 Massu was transferred to 12th RTS at Saintes, Charente-Maritime. He served in Togo from January 1935 to February 1937 performing military and civilian duties in Komkombas. Then he was stationed in Lorraine with the 41st RMIC until June 1938, when he was sent to Chad to command the subdivision of Tibesti with headquarters in Zouar.

==World War II==
He was serving in Africa when World War II broke out, and joined the Free French Forces. He took part in the battle of Fezzan with the armoured troops of General Leclerc. In 1941, he was in charge of the &quot;bataillon de marche du Tchad&quot;. He served as a lieutenant-colonel in the 2nd Armored Division (2e DB) serving with distinction at the Battle of Dompaire in September 1944 earning the US Silver star. He served with the division until the end of the war.

==Indochina==
In September 1945, he landed in Saigon and took part in the retaking of the city and of the South of Indochina.

Massu took command of a mechanized infantry force of the 2e DB named &quot;Groupement Massu&quot;, comprising a reconnaissance squadron with M8 Greyhound armoured cars from 7e Escadron, 1er Régiment de Marche de Spahis Marocains; a squadron of M5A1 Stuart light tanks of 1e Compagnie, 501e Régiment de chars de combat; a provisional infantry force of the 4e Bataillon, Régiment de marche du Tchad and the French Navy’s Régiment Blindé de Fusiliers-Marins, with M3 Half-tracks; and engineer elements of the 71er Bataillon du Génie. This force was landed at Saigon between 10 and 15 October 1945, and was immediately deployed to recapture Mỹ Tho in the Mekong Delta from the Viet Minh.

==Egypt==
In 1956, the 10th Parachute Division was sent to Egypt to take back the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. The 10th Parachute Division landed at Raswa. Raswa imposed the problem of a small drop zone surrounded by water, but Massu assured Andre Beaufre that this was not an insolvable problem for his men. 500 heavily armed paratroopers of the French 2nd Colonial Parachute Regiment (&quot;2ème RPC&quot;), hastily redeployed from combat in Algeria, jumped over the al-Raswa bridges from Nord Noratlas 2501 transports of the &quot;Escadrille de Transport&quot; (ET) 1/61 and ET 3/61, together with some combat engineers of the Guards Independent Parachute Company.

Despite the loss of two soldiers, the western bridge was swiftly secured by the paras, and F4U Corsairs of the Aéronavale 14.F and 15.F flew a series of close-air-support missions, destroying several SU-100 tank destroyers. F-84Fs also hit two large oil storage tanks in Port Said, which went up in flames and covered most of the city in a thick cloud of smoke for the next several days. Egyptian resistance varied, with some positions fighting back until destroyed, while others were abandoned with little resistance. The French paratroopers stormed and took Port Said&#x27;s waterworks that morning, an important objective to control in a city in the desert. Chateau-Jobert followed up this success by beginning an attack on Port Fuad. Derek Varble, the American military historian, later wrote &quot;Air support and fierce French assaults transformed the fighting at Port Fuad into a rout&quot;. During the fighting in the Canal Zone, the French paratroopers often practiced their &quot;no-prisoners&#x27;&quot; code and executed Egyptian POWs.

==Algeria==
A brigadier general in June 1955, Massu commanded the &quot;groupe parachutiste d&#x27;intervention&quot; and from 1956 the 10th Parachute Division. Massu&#x27;s division was sent to Algeria in response to a wave of armed attacks and terrorist bombings coordinated by Algerian FLN. Massu ultimately won the Battle of Algiers in 1957, during which French forces were able to identify and arrest the leadership of the FLN in Algiers through the use of coercive methods of interrogation and torture on members of subordinate cells. In July 1958, he was promoted to général de division and took the head of the army corps of Algiers, as well as functions of prefect for the region of Algiers. It was said of Massu that he willingly admitted to the use of torture on suspected members of the FLN. He insisted that he would never subject anyone to any treatment that he had not first tried out on himself. In Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot;, a controversial depiction of the events in Algiers between 1954 and 1957 banned in France for five years after release for alleged pro-Algerian leanings, the principal French character Col. Mathieu is a composite based on Massu and several of his subordinates, likely including Roger Trinquier and Marcel Bigeard.

==1958 coup d&#x27;état==
The Algiers putsch of 1958 began when the current government suggested that it would negotiate with the FLN, bringing the instability and ineffectiveness of the Fourth Republic to a head. On 13 May right-wing elements seized power in Algiers and called for a Government of Public Safety under General de Gaulle. Massu became chairman of the Public Safety Committee and one of the leaders of the revolt. The putschists threatened to conduct an assault on Paris, involving paratroopers and armoured forces based at Rambouillet, unless Charles de Gaulle was placed in charge of the Republic. De Gaulle did so on condition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be de Gaulle, ruled for seven-year periods. These changes were introduced and the Fifth Republic was born.

On 14 January 1960, Massu gave an interview with the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; newspaper in which he declared,

The Army has the power. It did not show it yet, because the opportunity did not arise. But the Army will use its power in one precise occasion (...) it encourages settlers to constitute paramilitary organisations and provides them weapons.

Massu was immediately summoned to Paris where he was relieved of command and posted to Metz. He was replaced in Algeria by General Jean Crépin.

==Later life==
After his criticism of the policy of de Gaulle in 1960, Massu was fired from his position of military governor of Algiers. In 1962 he became military governor of Metz and of the Sixth military region in France. He was promoted to général de corps d&#x27;armée (4 stars) in 1963. In March 1966, he became général d&#x27;armée (5 stars) and was made chief of the French forces in Germany. On 29 May 1968, de Gaulle came to visit him at his headquarters in Baden-Baden during the events of May 68. Massu assured de Gaulle of his support, but according to some sources conditioned it upon an amnesty for French soldiers involved in the Organisation armée secrète who had opposed Algerian independence and attempted to assassinate de Gaulle on several occasions.

Massu retired from military duty in July 1969 and spent the rest of his life in his home at Conflans-sur-Loing writing his memoirs. On 15 June 2000, Louisette Ighilahriz, a woman who had been a member of the FLN, accused Massu and Marcel Bigeard in an interview published in &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspaper of being present when she was tortured and raped by the French Army at a military prison in 1957. Ighilahriz had come forward with her story as she wanted to thank one &quot;Richaud&quot;, an Army doctor at the prison, for saving her life, saying that Dr. Richaud was a most kindly man who always treated her injuries. In response, Massu told &quot;Le Monde&quot; that &quot;torture had been part of a certain ambience in Algiers in 1957&quot;. Massu denied being present when Ighilahriz had been tortured and raped, saying he could not remember her, but expressed &quot;regret&quot; that the paras had engaged in torture and used rape as an interrogation tool, saying that there were things that had happened that he had wished had never happened in Algeria. Bigeard by contrast called Ighilahriz&#x27;s story a &quot;tissue of lies&quot; designed to &quot;destroy all that is decent in France&quot;, going on to say this &quot;Richaud&quot; had never existed. Bigeard was contradicted by Massu, who confirmed the existence of &quot;Richaud&quot;, saying that Ighilahriz was referring to Dr. François Richaud who had been the doctor stationed at the prison in 1957.

Massu died at Conflans-sur-Loing on 26 October 2002, aged 94.

<text>Hau Ruck is the fourteenth album by industrial rock band KMFDM, released by Metropolis Records on September 13, 2005. It was recorded in Seattle, Washington

==Background==
While touring in support of 2003&#x27;s &quot;WWIII&quot;, band leader Sascha Konietzko discussed the group&#x27;s plans for the next album: &quot;What we can all agree on, and I&#x27;m not saying we disagree on any other things, but everybody was pointing out that it should be really different. There are terms floating around such as, &#x27;More noisy, more dance-y, more electronic and less butt rock.&#x27;&quot; After releasing a single album with Sanctuary Records, the band re-signed with Metropolis Records.

The album had originally been titled &quot;FUBAR&quot;, in reference to the military acronym standing for &quot;Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition/Repair&quot;. However, in June 2005 the band announced they were abandoning that title, and on July 21, 2005, they announced the new title would be &quot;Hau Ruck&quot;, German for &quot;heave-ho&quot;. &quot;Hau Ruck&quot; is the first KMFDM album without a five-letter word title since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot;.

==Production==
According to Sascha Konietzko, &quot;Hau Ruck&quot; was created entirely using analog equipment.

==Release==
&quot;Hau Ruck&quot; was released on September 13, 2005. Many songs from &quot;Hau Ruck&quot; were remixed for KMFDM&#x27;s next release, &quot;Ruck Zuck&quot;.

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
* Lucia Cifarelli – vocals
* Jules Hodgson – guitars, bass, programming, engineering
* Sascha Konietzko – vocals, analogue synthesizers, sequencers, engineering

<text>Modern Humorist was a United States–based humor webzine founded in 2000 by John Aboud and Michael Colton (who later became panelists on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Best Week Ever&quot;), and managed by CEO Kate Barker. Its board of directors included feature film producer Frank Marshall and comedian Jon Stewart.

A competitor of &quot;The Onion&quot;, &quot;Modern Humorist&quot; stopped publishing new material in 2003. The site&#x27;s archives remain online and free to the public. It was nominated for a Webby Award in the Humor category in 2001 and in 2004, losing to &quot;The Onion&quot; both times.

==Books==
&quot;Modern Humorist&quot; produced three books:
* (2001) &quot;My First Presidentiary&quot; ()

<doc id="1317629" wikidata="Q4648832" url="?curid=1317629" title="A1205 road">
<text>The A1205 is a road in east London which runs north to south parallel to the Regent&#x27;s Canal and connects South Hackney and Victoria Park with the A13 at Limehouse. It is approximately 2 miles (3 km) in length, and runs in a roughly SSW direction.

==Route==
===Lauriston Road===

The road starts at a roundabout junction with Victoria Park Road in South Hackney in the London Borough of Hackney, and for the short distance it is in that borough it is called &quot;Lauriston Road&quot;.

===Grove Road===

The road then enters the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and forms a divide between the two halves of Victoria Park, until a roundabout junction with Old Ford Road (the B118). By the roundabout is the Lakeview Estate, designed by Berthold Lubetkin. From there until it crosses Mile End Road, the A1205 is called Grove Road and for much of the distance after crossing Roman Road it forms the eastern boundary of Mile End Park.

Where the road passes under the Great Eastern Main Line, there is a plaque indicating the spot where, on 13 June 1944, during the Second World War, the first V-1 flying bomb to hit London fell, killing six, injuring 30, and making 200 people homeless. The area remained derelict for many years until it was cleared to extend Mile End Park. Before demolition, local artist Rachel Whiteread made a cast of the inside of 193 Grove Road. Despite attracting controversy, the exhibit won her the Turner Prize for 1993.

===Burdett Road===
====History====
Built in 1858, it was at first called Victoria Park Approach Road because it enabled access from the docks to Victoria Park. On 19 December 1862 it was renamed Burdett Road after philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts. The Limehouse Board of Works objected to the change of name, saying it was unpatriotic, &quot;ridiculous&quot; and would lower house prices; but the name was retained, it being popular in the Mile End area. Burdett Road was the site of Burdett Road railway station, closed in 1941.

====Today====
Burdett Road is part of the North and East London red route system.

After crossing the junction with Bow Road and Mile End Road the remaining distance is called Burdett Road. It forms the western boundary of the Lansbury Estate and ceases to form the boundary of Mile End Park after passing Mile End Stadium and passing under the London, Tilbury and Southend line. Here a crossroads is formed with St Pauls Way (B140). The road then passes over Limehouse Cut before terminating at a junction with the A13 and the West India Dock Road.

==Culture==
It is referenced in the song &quot;Mile End&quot; by Pulp, featured in the 1996 film Trainspotting.

==Transportation==
===Buses===
The 277 bus serves the entire length of the road with other routes serving some sections: 425 till Mile End bus stop, D6 from the south of Burdett Road to Roman Road, D7 from the south of Burdett Road to Mile End bus stop (north of Mile End Road), 323 from Bow Common Lane to Mile End bus stop and the 339 from Roman Road to Mile End (turning east onto Mile End Road).

The 309 crosses it in the south (at St. Paul&#x27;s Way/Ben Jonson Road), and the 25, 205 and N205 at Mile End Road.

<text>Stop Foodborne Illness, or STOP (formerly known as Safe Tables Our Priority), is a non-profit public health organization in the United States dedicated to the prevention of illness and death from foodborne pathogens. It was founded following the West Coast &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 outbreak of 1993 in California and the Pacific Northwest. STOP&#x27;s headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois.
==History==
STOP formed as a grassroots organization out of the collective grief and anger of parents of victims of a major 1993 &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 outbreak associated with Jack in the Box hamburgers. The outbreak, which resulted in the death of four children and more than 700 people falling ill, garnered nationwide media attention.

<doc id="1317660" wikidata="Q11337203" url="?curid=1317660" title="Exchange rate regime">
<text>An exchange rate regime is a way a monetary authority of a country or currency union manages the currency about other currencies and the foreign exchange market. It is closely related to monetary policy and the two are generally dependent on many of the same factors, such as economic scale and openness, inflation rate, the elasticity of the labor market, financial market development, and capital mobility.

There are two major regime types: 
* &quot;Floating (or flexible) exchange rate&quot; regimes exist where exchange rates are determined solely by market forces, and often manipulated by open-market operations. Countries do have the ability to influence their floating currency from activities such as buying/selling currency reserves, changing interest rates, and through foreign trade agreements. 
* &quot;Fixed (or pegged) exchange rate&quot; regimes exist when a country sets the value of its home currency directly proportional to the value of another currency or commodity. For years, many currencies were fixed (or pegged) to gold. If the value of gold rose, the value of the currency fixed to gold would also rise. Today, many currencies are fixed (pegged) to floating currencies from major nations. Many countries have fixed their currency value to the U.S. dollar, the euro, or the British pound.

There are also intermediate exchange rate regimes that combine elements of the other regimes.

This classification of exchange rate regime is based on the classification method carried out by GGOW (Ghos, Guide, Ostry and Wolf, 1995, 1997), which combined the IMF de jure classification with the actual exchange behavior so as to differentiate between official and actual policies. The GGOW classification method is also known as the trichotomy method.

==Fixed versus floating==

There are many factors a country should consider before deciding on a fixed or floating currency, with pros and cons to both choices.

If a country chooses to fix its local currency to that of another country (like the US dollar) they achieve exchange rate stability. This means that any time that country trades with the United States or conducts trade denominated in US dollars, there is certainty around how much the local currency will be worth in terms of US dollars. Businesses enjoy this certainty and pegging a currency can often lead to foreign direct investment (FDI). However, when a country decides to fix their currency they give up monetary autonomy. They are not able to set their own exchange rates, and thus the relative strength or weakness of their currency is fully dependent on the strength or weakness of the currency they have chosen to fix their local currency to.

If a country chooses to be free-floating like the US dollar, they are monetarily independent- however they lose the exchange rate stability that fixed currencies have. Notice you can not achieve a currency that is monetarily independent yet also has an exchange rate stability. This inability to have both is part of a concept known as the incompatible trinity. When deciding upon a currency regime countries can achieve two out of three things: full financial integration, exchange rate stability, or monetary independence. A country can never have a currency that achieves all three.

== Exchange rate regimes ==
==Floating exchange rate regime==

A floating (or flexible) exchange rate regime is one in which a country&#x27;s exchange rate fluctuates in a wider range and the country&#x27;s monetary authority makes no attempt to fix it against any base currency. A movement in the exchange is either an appreciation or depreciation.

Free float (or floating exchange rate)

Under a free float, also known as clean float, a currency&#x27;s value is allowed to fluctuate in response to foreign-exchange market mechanisms without government intervention.

Managed float (or dirty float)

Under a managed float, also known as dirty float, a government may intervene in the market exchange rate in a variety of ways and degrees, in an attempt to make the exchange rate move in a direction conducive to the economic development of the country, especially during an extreme appreciation or depreciation.

A monetary authority may, for example, allow the exchange rate to float freely between an upper and lower bound, a price &quot;ceiling&quot; and &quot;floor&quot;.

== Intermediate rate regime==
The exchange rate regimes between the fixed ones and the floating ones.

Band (or target zone)

There is only a tiny variation around the fixed exchange rate against another currency, well within plus or minus 2%.

For example, Denmark has fixed its exchange rate against the euro, keeping it very close to 7.44 krone = 1 euro (0.134 euro = 1 krone).

Crawling peg

A crawling peg is when a currency steadily depreciates or appreciates at an almost constant rate against another currency, with the exchange rate following a simple trend.

Crawling band

Some variation about the rate is allowed, and adjusted as above: for example, see Colombia from 1996 to 2002 and Chile in the 1990s.

Currency basket peg

A currency basket is a portfolio of selected currencies with different weightings. The currency basket peg is commonly used to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations. For example, Kuwait shifted the peg based on a currency basket consists of currencies of its major trade and financial partners.

==Fixed exchange rate regime==

A fixed exchange rate regime, sometimes called a pegged exchange rate regime, is one in which a monetary authority pegs its currency&#x27;s exchange rate to another currency, a basket of other currencies or to another measure of value (such as gold), and may allow the rate to fluctuate within a narrow range. To maintain the exchange rate within that range, a country&#x27;s monetary authority usually needs to intervene in the foreign exchange market. A movement in the peg rate is called either revaluation or devaluation.

Currency board

Currency board is an exchange rate regime in which a country&#x27;s exchange rate maintain a fixed exchange rate with a foreign currency, based on an explicit legislative commitment. It is a type of fixed regime that has special legal and procedural rules designed to make the peg &quot;harder—that is, more durable&quot;. Examples include the Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar and Bulgarian lev against the Euro.

Dollarisation

Dollarisation, also &quot;currency substitution&quot;, means a country unilaterally adopts the currency of another country.

Most of the adopting countries are too small to afford the cost of running its own central bank or issuing its own currency. Most of these economies use the U.S. dollar, but other popular choices include the euro, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars.

Currency union

A currency union, also known as monetary union, is an exchange regime where two or more countries use the same currency. Under a currency union, there is some form of transnational structure such as a single central bank or monetary authority that is accountable to the member states.

Examples of currency unions are the Eurozone, CFA and CFP franc zones. One of the first known examples is the Latin Monetary Union that existed between 1865 and 1927. The Scandinavian Monetary Union existed between 1873 and 1905.

<doc id="1317665" wikidata="Q216848" url="?curid=1317665" title="Svínoy">
<text>Svínoy (, ) is an island in the north-east of the Faroe Islands, to the east of Borðoy and Viðoy. It takes its name from Old Norse, Svíney, meaning &quot;Swine Isle&quot;. Svinoy also refers to a section of the ocean where North Atlantic water flows into the Norwegian Sea. There is a similarly named island, Swona, in the Orkney Islands.

Svínoy like Kalsoy is a comparatively isolated island, in that there are no bridge, tunnel or causeway links to it. There are boat and helicopter connections.

==Geography==
Svínoy is divided into two unequally sized peninsulas. The coast is mostly steep slopes and cliffs, including the precipice of Eysturhøvdi on the north coast. It has only one settlement, also named Svínoy, where all the inhabitants live.

===Important Bird Area===
The coastline of the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (25,000 pairs), Atlantic puffins (10,000 pairs) and black guillemots (100 pairs).

===Mountains===

There are seven mountains on Svínoy:

== History ==
*975 Viking Chief Svínoyar-Bjarni is mentioned in the Færeyinga saga. A headstone in the church is assumed to be Bjarni&#x27;s memorial stone.
*1583 Jacob Eudensen from Svinoy was the last person in the Faroe Islands to be condemned to death for heresy; he had refused to renounce his Catholic faith and convert to Lutheranism.

<text>The Atlantic Women&#x27;s Colleges Conference was an eight-member college athletics conference founded in 1995 and given official status in 1999. It competed in NCAA Division III and as its name implies, only offered championships in women&#x27;s sports. In the conference&#x27;s later years, several of its members finally became co-educational. Following the 2006–07 season, these members, seeking homes for their newly created men&#x27;s athletic programs departed for other conferences. Other members also switched affiliations, leaving the conference without enough members to be officially sanctioned. Following the 2007 spring season, the conference ceased operations as some of its members struggled with enrollment, and thus opted for co-education.

<doc id="1317673" wikidata="Q56492" url="?curid=1317673" title="Tewa language">
<text>Tewa ( ) is a Tanoan language spoken by several Pueblo nations in the Rio Grande valley in New Mexico north of Santa Fe, and in Arizona. It is also known as Tano, or Tée-wah (archaic). There is some disagreement among the Tewa people about whether or not Tewa should have a written form, as some Pueblo elders believe that their language should be preserved by oral tradition alone. Because of this, it was not until the 1960s that the language was written down for the first time. However, many Tewa speakers have decided that Tewa literacy is an important aspect in passing down the language and so orthographies have been created for this purpose.

The language has struggled to maintain a healthy speaker base; however, because of efforts to preserve the language starting in the 1980s—both by native speakers and linguists—this problem is not as dire as it for some other indigenous languages.

Tewa has a fairly large phoneme inventory with 45 distinct individual sounds. Twelve of these are vowels, which can be either long or short. Tewa, like other Tanoan languages, also makes use of tones, of which it has four.

== Dialects and usage ==
The 1980 census counted 1,298 speakers, almost all of whom are bilingual in English. 

Today, the Endangered Languages Project estimates a total of 1,500 speakers worldwide, with 1,200 of them in the New Mexico pueblos and 300 in the Arizona village of Hano. Of these speakers, few are fluent with the vast majority being semi-speakers, and only in a few places, like Hano, are children acquiring Tewa. The largest New Mexico pueblo, San Juan, there are only 30 fluent speakers left as of 2008.
* Santa Clara Pueblo: 207 speakers (1980)

As of 2012, Tewa is defined as &quot;severely endangered&quot; in New Mexico by UNESCO.

In the names &quot;Pojoaque&quot; and &quot;Tesuque&quot;, the element spelled &quot;que&quot; (pronounced something like in Tewa, or in English) is Tewa for &quot;place&quot;.

Tewa can be written with the Latin script; this is occasionally used for such purposes as signs ( , or ). Because alphabet systems have been developed in the different pueblos, Tewa has a variety of orthographies rather than a single standardized alphabet.

One of the main dialectical delineations of the Santa Clara dialect is the use of /j/ in words where only /y/ is heard in other pueblos, although some Santa Clara speakers use /y/ and /j/ sporadically.

Another important dialectical difference aligns Santa Clara, Tesuque, and San Ildefonso Tewa against San Juan and Nambe Tewa. The former use /d/ in the same environments where the latter use a nasal plus /d/.

In two-syllable word bases, words that have a short /u/ in the initial syllable have a long /u/ in the Santa Clara dialect. In the Santa Clara dialect, where other pueblos have a high tone on this syllable, there will instead be a glide tone. 

== Phonology ==

The phonemes of Rio Grande Tewa are as follows:

=== Consonants ===
* The voiced postalveolar affricate occurs in the Santa Clara dialect.
* All alveolars shown are apico-alveolar. 
* and are dorso-prevelar before front vowels and dorso-velar before back vowels. Spirantization can also occur, causing to be pronounced like or .
* is apico-dental.
* ranges from to to .
* ranges from apico-dental to .
* ranges from to .
* ranges from to .
* is pronounced as if proceeding velar or glottal consonants, , or an external transition.

=== Vowels ===
* Vowels have both length and nasal differentiation.
* In syllables closed by nasal consonants or in final weak stressed syllables, occurs as [ɪˆ].
* is [e] when long, but is [eˇ] when short and [əˆ] when closed by a nasal consonant.
* , when following is realized a bit raised, and when following is realized as [əˆ].
* is realized as [ʊˆ] in syllables closed by a nasal vowel.
* The long nasalized variety of is, in some speakers, realized as [ɐ].

=== Syllable structure ===
There are 9 types of syllables in Tewa: CV, CV:, CVN, CVh, CVʔ, CV&#x27;, CVʔN, V, and VN.

N here stands for nasal, and as seen, there are some constructions where the only consonants available are :, h, or nasals, and as such these have been specified in order to create maximum specificity, instead of just referring to these constructions with just the C for consonant.

=== Tone ===
Tewa has three tones, high, low, and glide. 

Within two-syllable words, the only combinations found are high-high, low-low, low-high, and high-low.

=== Stress ===
The use of stress in Tewa is still relatively unknown.

In two-syllable nouns with the pattern CVCV and the tone pattern high-high or low-low, there is heavier stress placed on the first syllable. Roots also tend to show heavier stress than affixes if each is the same syllable and tone type. A stronger stress is associated with a higher tone and greater vowel length. However, because of the complex use of tone, syllable type, and contour segments more research does need to be done.

== Morphology ==

=== Roots ===

Tewa has what are called both &quot;free&quot; and &quot;bound&quot; roots. 

Free roots are defined as those roots which can be converted directly into a word, sometimes be the addition of a word superfix. Within free roots, there are two additional types, isolated and non-isolated free roots. There is a very small number of isolated free roots, as these are roots that are neither combinable with other roots nor affixable. Non-isolated free roots are roots that are combinable with other roots and/or are affixable. A limited non-isolated free root is one which can combine only with affixes, but not with other roots. A universal non-isolated free root is one which can combine both with other roots and affixes.

Bound roots are defined as those roots which cannot be converted directly into a word.

=== Verbs ===

Tewa has 15 types of verbs, and a few example verbs and their conjugations are shown below.

Verbs can be divided into two classes, S and A, standing for stative and active, based of the pronomial prefixes which they contain. In general, S verbs deal with identity, quality, feeling, condition, position, and motion. Class A verbs are, in general, transitive verbs.

==== Verb affixes ====

All known verb affixes are included in the chart below, showing where the affixes fall in particular constructions of words.
These affixes are used to delineate tense, subject, negation, and emphasis.

=== Nouns ===

Nouns are divided into two classes: class N, which is affixed with set marker /-n/, and class non-N, which does not have this affix. 

Class non-N is the larger of the two, containing almost all nouns in Tewa, which are, for the most part, mono- or di-syllabic.

Class N nouns are mostly designations for age-sex differentiation, kinship terms, and forms which translate as pronouns. 

==== Noun affixes ====
All known noun affixes are included in the chart below.

/-n2/ is different from /-n/ because of the occurrence of /-n2/ with singular, dual, and plural situations involving the same root, which is never the case for /-n/.

=== Class Z words ===

Class Z words are neither particles, verbs, or nouns. They are affixable with suffixes like /-á/, /-ân/, /-bo/, and /-ho&#x27;/, /-reʔ/, /-an/, /-we/, and /-ge/, but unlike nouns and verbs they do not occur with the specific affixes which delineate those classes (/wé:-/ or /pi-/ and /-ví/ respectively).

These compromise words whose English equivalents involve time, location, manner, interrogation, etc.

=== Morphological processes ===

* Substitution: 
** /d/ becomes /r/, /d/ being the initial occurrence and following /n/.
** /b/ becomes /v/ in similar vowels to the /d/ ~ /r/ substitution. 
** /n/ becomes /m/, with the latter occurring before labials and the latter elsewhere. 
* Augmentation: Some suffixes occur with a longer form following /n/. 
* Contraction: Certain suffixes occur preceding /-á/ series marker, /-á/ emphasizer, /-ân/ emphasizer, and /-an/ question marker.

== Syntax ==
=== Word order ===
Tewa sentences follow subject-object-verb order, however there are simple sentences in Tewa such as &quot;&quot; (that&#x27;s how we got in) which are simply a subject and a predicate.

There are also many ways to say what would be translated as the same thing in English in Tewa. For example, there are three ways to say the sentence &quot;The man and the woman are entering&quot;:



=== Noun hierarchy ===
Tewa has a noun hierarchy in order to determine which noun phrase goes in which position, however this only influences passive sentences. In Tewa, this is a simple binary distinction between animate and nonanimate noun phrases. 

However, unlike in other languages with a noun hierarchy, such as Navajo, Tewa also marks the subject with the postposition -dí, meaning that there is not a concrete need to adhere to the noun hierarchy as that information is already morphologically encoded into sentences. Because of this, younger Tewa speakers tend to not use the noun hierarchy and instead rely on the morphology present in passive sentences. 

=== Grammatical number ===
Tewa, like other Tanoan languages, has a trepartite number system, which means that nouns can be counted through different syntactic constructions in three ways. In English, with morphosyntactic differences exist only for two numbers: singular and plural. Tewa, on the other hand differentiates between singular, dual, and plural nouns. 

However, Tewa also appears to group its nouns into two categories: those of &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;entities&quot;, with sets being marked by the affix /-n/ and entities the lack of said affix. Because of this, when creating plurality out of an entity, the affix /-n/ must be removed and the base root will be one not seen outside of plurality or duality.

Tewa also has what is called &quot;inverse&quot; numbering, which is a feature of many Tanoan languages. A chart of the indefinite articles for &quot;a, some&quot; can help show this phenomenon: 

As seen, that which marks singular for one class marks plural for another class and vice versa.

== Language revitalization ==
Esther Martinez, who lived to be 94 years old, was nationally known for her commitment to preserving the Tewa language. Her San Juan Pueblo Tewa Dictionary was published in 1982. The Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act is named for her, and as of September 15, 2012, members of the New Mexico congressional delegation have introduced legislation to extend the program for another five years.

Digital language documentation efforts were underway as of 1995.

Tewa language programs are available for children in most of the Tewa-speaking pueblos. The Santa Clara Pueblo Tewa Language Revitalization Program also sponsors cultural activities, such as visiting Crow Canyon.

Children&#x27;s stories in Tewa have been digitized by the University of New Mexico, and are available online.

A 2012 documentary film, &quot;The Young Ancestors&quot;, follows a group of teenagers from Santa Fe Preparatory School as they learn the Tewa language in a self-study program with the help of a mentor, seventh grade literature teacher Laura Kaye Jagles.

<text>The Lancia Aurelia is a car produced by Italian manufacturer Lancia from 1950 to the summer of 1958. It is noted for using one of the first series-production V6 engines. Several body styles were offered: 4-door saloon, 2-door GT coupé (B20), 2-door spider/convertible (B24), and a chassis to be custom bodied by external coachbuilders.

Establishing a post-war Lancia tradition, the car was named after a Roman road: the Via Aurelia, leading from Rome to Pisa.

== Specifications ==

The Aurelia was designed under the direction of engineer Vittorio Jano. Its engine, one of the first production V6 engines, a 60° design developed by Francesco de Virgilio, who was between 1943 and 1948 a Lancia engineer, and who worked under Jano. During production, capacity grew from 1.8 L to 2.5 L. Prototype engines used a bore and stroke of 68 mm x 72 mm for 1,569 cc; these were tested between 1946 and 1948. It was an all-alloy pushrod design with a single camshaft between the cylinder banks. A hemispherical combustion chamber and in-line valves were used. A single Solex or Weber carburettor completed the engine. Some uprated 1,991 cc models were fitted with twin carburettors.

At the rear was an innovative combination transaxle with the gearbox, clutch, differential, and inboard-mounted drum brakes. The front suspension was a sliding pillar design, with rear semi-trailing arms replaced by a de Dion tube in the Fourth series. The Aurelia was also first car to be fitted with radial tires as standard equipment.
Initially 165SR400 Michelin X and later on the sports models fitted with 165HR400 Pirelli Cinturato.

== History ==

=== First series ===


The very first Aurelias were the B10 berlinas (sedans). They used a 1754 cc version of the V6 which produced . The B21 was released in 1951 with a larger 1991 cc engine. A 2-door B20 GT coupé appeared that same year. It had a shorter wheelbase and a Ghia-designed, Pinin Farina-built body. The same 1991 cc engine produced in the B20. In all, 500 first series Aurelias were produced.

=== Second series ===

The second series Aurelia coupé pushed power up to from the 1991 cc V6 with a higher compression ratio and repositioned valves. Other changes included better brakes and minor styling tweaks, such as chromed bumpers instead of the aluminium ones used in the earlier car. A new dashboard featured two larger instrument gauges. The suspension was unchanged from the first series. A new B22 sedan was released in 1952 with dual Webers and a hotter camshaft for .

===Third series===
The third series appeared in 1953 with a larger 2451 cc version of the engine. The rear of the car lost the tail fins of the earlier series.

===Fourth series===
The fourth series introduced the new de Dion tube rear suspension. The engine was changed from white metal bearings to shell bearings. An open car, the B24 Spider, was introduced at this time (1954 to 1955) and was well received. It was similar to the B20 coupé mechanically, with an 8-inch (203 mm) shorter wheelbase than the coupé.

The fourth series cars were the first B20 Aurelias to be available in left-hand drive. C. 12% of Series 1 Saloon (Berlina) production - B10, B21, B22 - were left-hand drive. Fourth series Aurelias were the first ones to be imported to the US in any number.

===Fifth series===
The fifth series coupé, appearing in 1956, was more luxury-oriented. It had a different transaxle (split case), which was more robust and similar to that used in the later Flaminias. The driveshaft was also revised to reduce vibration.

Alongside the fifth series coupés was a revised open car, the B24 convertible. This differed from the earlier B24 Spider, having roll-up windows, better seating position, and a windscreen with vent windows. In mechanical aspects, the B24 convertible was similar to the coupé of the same series.

This model was immortalized by Dino Risi&#x27;s 1962 movie &quot;Il Sorpasso&quot; (&quot;The Easy Life&quot;), starring Vittorio Gassman. The actual car used for shooting (a single model) was not destroyed during the accident scene sealing the end of the story: an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider was used as replacement.

===Sixth series===
Power was down to for the 1957 sixth series, with increased torque to offset the greater weight of the later car. The sixth series coupés had vent windows, and typically a chrome strip down the bonnet. They were the most touring oriented of the B20 series.

The sixth series B24 convertible was very similar to the fifth series, with some minor differences in trim. Most notably, the fuel tank was in the boot, not behind the seats as it was in the fourth and fifth series open cars. This change, however, did not apply for the first 150 sixth series cars, which were like the fifth series. The sixth series convertibles also featured different seats than either both earlier cars.

==Models==

===Lancia Aurelia Spider (B24)===
Produced only in 1954–1955, 240 cars were built. Panoramic front windscreen, distinctive 2 part chrome bumpers, removable side screens, soft top and Pinin Farina styling. 181 LHD cars with B24S (&#x27;sinistra&#x27;) designation; the remaining 59 cars were right-hand drive. All were equipped with 2451 cc V6 engines. Built on a wheelbase, the B24S Spider was mechanically similar to the 4th Series Aurelia B20, except for different air filters. All models had a floor-mounted gear-change. The dashboard featured one prominent and two small dials.

In 2014, RM Auctions sold a &quot;barn find&quot; 1955 Aurelia Spider at auction for £500,000 ($805,154 USD).
In 2014, Gooding and Company Auctions sold a restored 1955 Aurelia Spider for $1,815,000.

In 2023, an unrestored Lancia Aurelia B24 Spider America 1955 sold for €540.000 at the auction of a &quot;barn find&quot;. 
===Lancia Aurelia Convertible (B24)===
Produced from 1956, second series with many small alterations to the Aurelia Spider. It was mechanically based on the 5th series Aurelia B20. Cars from this series have a flatter windscreen with quarter-lights, deeper doors with external handles and wind-up windows. It also had one part chrome bumpers and a wider bonnet air-scoop. It had a proper convertible hood and a hardtop was available. 521 cars were built. The B24S Convertible was built on the same wheelbase as the Spider and used a slightly less powerful () 2,451cc V6 engine. Dashboard features 2 big dials. 

=== Lancia Aurelia Cabriolet (B50/B52) ===

The first prototype of the B50 cabriolet was shown at the 1950 Turin Auto Show. Produced in small numbers, around 265 cars, by cabriolet-specialist Pinin Farina, the B50 Cabriolet was a four-seat comfortable cruiser. It is powered by a 1,754cc engine. The majority of the production was done between 1950 and 1952. Some cars had an improved B52 platform which came with the 2.0-litre engine of the B20/B21. In total Lancia built only 98 B52 chassis, the last of which was delivered in 1953.

==== Lancia Aurelia PF200 Spider ====
The PF200 was a concept car that debuted on the Pinin Farina (as it was then) stand at the 1952 Turin Motor Show. The show car was built for promotional purposes to generate publicity and was never intended for series production, although Pinin Farina went on to build a further six examples, some open, some closed. The seven PF200s were slightly different from one another, although all featured the signature circular front air intake reminiscent of the North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter. The cars featured side air intakes and six exhaust pipes, while instead of stowing the soft-top behind the seats, like many open cars of the period, Pinin Farina arranged for the PF200&#x27;s hood to fold down out of sight within the body. The PF200 used the chassis and running gear of the Lancia Aurelia B52.

==Motorsport==
In the 1951 Mille Miglia a 2-litre Aurelia, driven by Giovanni Bracco and Umberto Maglioli, finished second, beaten only by a Ferrari 340 America. The same year it took first in class and 12th overall at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Modified Aurelias took the first three places in the 1952 Targa Florio with Felice Bonetto as the winner and another win on Lièges-Rome-Lièges of 1953. The fifth edition of the Coppa della Toscana netted 1-2-3 victory for the Lancia Aurelia GT 2500 of Scuderia Lancia.

One of the most important wins came in 1954 at the Monte Carlo Rally. An Aurelia GT co-driven by Louis Chiron and Ciro Basadonna took the top step of the podium, which was the first of Lancia&#x27;s many overall victories at the legendary rally held on the roads above the principality.

==Production numbers==

;Notes
* not including one pre-production B24 prototype constructed in 1954

==In popular culture==

The Lancia Aurelia is featured prominently in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, one of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, in the story&#x27;s car chase scene. The car&#x27;s Italian driver has great pride in Italian cars, which he claims are the best in the world.

Dino Risi&#x27;s 1962 movie &quot;The Easy Life&quot; (&quot;Il Sorpasso&quot;, starring Vittorio Gassmann and Jean-Louis Trintignant, a fine example of the &quot;Commedia all&#x27;italiana&quot; genre) features the Lancia Aurelia, one of the most iconic cars in Italian cinema. It was unusual at that time for a film to be filmed almost entirely in a car and &quot;The Easy Life&quot; can be considered one of the first road movies. The Lancia Aurelia used was a 1958 B24 Convertible and the driving scenes were very unusually filmed on the road rather than with a projected backdrop.

<text>Richard Schechner is University Professor Emeritus at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, and editor of &quot;TDR: The Drama Review&quot;.

==Biography==
Richard Schechner received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1956, a Master&#x27;s degree from the University of Iowa two years later, and a PhD from Tulane University in 1962. He edited &quot;The Drama Review&quot;, formerly the &quot;Tulane Drama Review&quot;, from 1962 to 1969; and again from 1986 to the present.

Schechner went on to become one of the founders of the Performance Studies department of the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. He founded The Performance Group of New York in 1967 and was its artistic director until 1980, when they changed their name to The Wooster Group. The home of both is the Performing Garage in New York&#x27;s SoHo district, a building acquired by Schechner in 1968. That year Schechner signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. In 1992, Schechner founded East Coast Artists with whom he continues to work. He writes books and also articles for journals worldwide.

In the 1990s, Schechner originated &quot;rasaboxes,&quot; a technique of emotional training for performers and others.

In his seminal 1993 work &quot;The Future of Ritual,&quot; Schechner explores how human belief, artistic expression, and cultural belonging converge in human societies to express authenticity and foster identity. Noting that the term avant-garde no longer serves its original purpose, he goes on to analyze theatre and ritual in guerilla street theatre and ritualized aspects of cultural experimentation in an international context.

Beginning in 2007, the Richard Schechner Center for Performance Studies at the Shanghai Theatre Academy began publishing the bi-annual &quot;TDR/China&quot;.

==Theatrical/directorial works==

In March 2005, the Richard Schechner Center for Performance Studies was inaugurated as part of the Shanghai Theatre Academy, where Schechner is an Honorary Professor. With The Performance Group Schechner directed many productions including &quot;Dionysus in 69&quot; based on Euripides&#x27; The Bacchae (1968), Makbeth based on Shakespeare&#x27;s Macbeth (1969), Commune group devised piece (1970), Sam Shepard&#x27;s The Tooth of Crime (1972), Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Mother Courage and Her Children (1975), David Gaard&#x27;s The Marilyn Project (1975), Seneca&#x27;s Oedipus (1977), Terry Curtis Fox&#x27;s Cops (1978), and Jean Genet&#x27;s The Balcony (1979). With East Coast Artists, Schechner has directed Faust/gastronome (1993), Anton Chekhov&#x27;s Three Sisters (1995), William Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet (1999), and Schechner&#x27;s and Saviana Stanescu&#x27;s YokastaS (2003, YokastaS Redux 2005), Lian Amaris&#x27;s Swimming to Spalding (2009), Imagining O (three versions: 2011, 2012, 2014). Schechner has also directed in Asia and Africa: Anton Chekhov&#x27;s Cherry ka Baghicha (1983 in Hindi) in New Delhi, Sun Huizhu&#x27;s Mingri Jiuyao Chu Shan (1989 in Shanghai in Mandarin) August Wilson&#x27;s Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom (1992) at the Grahamstown Festival, South Africa, Aeschylus&#x27;s The Oresteia (1995 in Taipei in Mandarin), and Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet (2007 in Shanghai and 2009 in Wroclaw, Poland, in Mandarin).

While in New Orleans from 1960 to 1967, Schechner was a producing director with John O&#x27;Neal and Gilbert Moses of the Free Southern Theater (1963–65) and a founding director with Franklin Adams and Paul Epstein of the New Orleans Group (1964–67). Schechner was instrumental in identifying many exceptional writers, including Sam Shepard, Jean-Claude VanItallie, Murray Mednick, Ronald Tavel and Canadian-trained Megan Terry, whose techniques he compared to Shakespeare. He described Terry&#x27;s &quot;Viet Rock&quot; as &quot;Elizabethan in scope and tone.&quot; Plays, Schechner maintained, should be &quot;wrought&quot; rather than &quot;written&quot; - and he implied that Shakespeare &quot;wrought&quot; large at the turn of the seventeenth century by working closely with London&#x27;s burgeoning theatrical companies. Schechner sought to emulate this technique in the late sixties with his Performance Group.

Schechner is currently editor of the Enactments series published by Seagull Books and editor of the Worlds of Performance series published by Routledge.

<text>Chestnut Hill College is a private Catholic college in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The college was founded in 1924 as a women&#x27;s college by the Sisters of St. Joseph. It was originally named Mount Saint Joseph College.

In 1980, the college established a coeducational graduate education program and started to admit male students to its undergraduate programs in 2003. As of 2012, a total of 2,318 students were enrolled in Chestnut Hill College&#x27;s three constituent schools, with fewer than 900 as undergraduates.

== History ==
Located at the northwestern edge of Philadelphia, on , overlooking the Wissahickon Creek, Chestnut Hill College opened in 1924 as a Catholic, four-year, liberal arts college for women. Founded as Mount Saint Joseph College by the Sisters of St. Joseph, the college was renamed in 1938 as Chestnut Hill College. In the 1960s, the high school section moved to Flourtown, about away, and retains the original name Mount Saint Joseph.

Throughout its history, the college has aimed to offer a liberal arts education that provides students with a broad background in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, to prepare students for life&#x27;s challenges by helping them to grow intellectually, spiritually, emotionally, and socially.

The curriculum has been modified over time. The college originally awarded only the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees to young women of traditional college age. In 1972, a continuing education department, now called the School of Continuing Studies, was established to extend opportunities for undergraduate study to mature women and men. Many classes are conducted on evenings and weekends to accommodate the schedules of older students. The coeducational school of graduate studies was established in 1980 to offer master&#x27;s degrees; in 1997, it added a doctoral program.

Academic changes also included expanding beyond the physical limits of the campus. As a member of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Consortium for Higher Education (SEPCHE), Chestnut Hill pursues a collaborative approach to higher education with seven other local institutions. Through membership in the Association of Colleges of Sisters of St. Joseph (ACSSJ), Chestnut Hill offers its students opportunities to enrich their educational experiences by studying at seven other colleges in the United States. Study-abroad programs also are available.

In November 2001, Chestnut Hill College announced plans to admit men to the traditional-age, full-time undergraduate program in fall 2003. With the enrollment of male students, the 78-year-old College for Women became the School of Undergraduate Studies.

Enrollment increased dramatically after the undergraduate college became coeducational, increasing 80% by fall 2005, and total enrollment numbered well over 2,000 in the 2010s.

==Campus==

The Chestnut Hill campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For many years the main buildings were St. Joseph Hall, with a six-story Greco-Roman rotunda and French Gothic exterior, Fournier Hall, a jewel of Italian Romanesque architecture, and Clement Hall, which houses classrooms and modest athletic facilities, including a swimming pool. The campus grounds include a grotto and fountain, the House of Loretto, and an elegant main chapel that was inspired by Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. Logue Library, Fontbonne Hall, Barbara D&#x27;Iorio Martino Hall and, most recently, a new residence hall called Fitzsimmons Hall are relatively new additions to accommodate the college&#x27;s growth. New structures were designed to preserve the architectural integrity of the campus while addressing specific educational or student life needs.

In recent years, the science facilities and computer laboratories have been renovated to help create a 21st-century teaching and learning environment. Martino Hall includes &quot;smart&quot; classrooms and seminar rooms that are part of the campus-wide interactive network.

In 2006, Chestnut Hill announced the acquisition (from the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation for $11 million) of the Sugarloaf Estate, a non-contiguous property across Germantown Avenue and Wissahickon Creek from the existing campus. It was previously used as The Albert M. Greenfield Conference Center of Temple University as well as the headquarters of the Greenfield Foundation, and from 1952 to 1967, as the residence of the Foundation&#x27;s namesake, local realty magnate Albert M. Greenfield. The additional property was used to accommodate additional campus expansion, including a residence hall. In addition, the 1929 Steel-Greenfield mansion was restored to its original appearance and renovated for classroom, conference and meeting use, and is now known as Commonwealth Chateau.

==Alumni==
More than 10,000 individuals have earned degrees from Chestnut Hill College since 1924. One alumna, Kathleen Byerly, was among the women featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine when the American Woman was selected Time&#x27;s Person of the Year for 1975. Frances Spence, one of the original ENIAC programmers, graduated from Chestnut Hill College in 1942. Writer of &quot;The Cat I Never Named&quot; Dr. Amra Sabic-el-Rayess went to Chestnut Hill for one semester after escaping genocide in Bosnia.

==Academics==
The college offers Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Science degrees. It also offers graduate programs in professional fields as well as the Doctor in Clinical Psychology degree (Psy.D.).

==Athletics==

Chestnut Hill College&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Griffins. Chestnut Hill College is an NCAA Division II institution that competes in the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC). Previously, Chestnut Hill was a charter member of the North Eastern Athletic Conference of NCAA Division III from 2004–2005 to 2006–2007. The college sponsors 17 varsity intercollegiate sports teams, with baseball, basketball, football, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, sprint football, and tennis for men, and basketball, bowling, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball for women. Julia Cohen, formerly in the top 100 in the world in women&#x27;s tennis, is an assistant coach of the tennis teams.

Chestnut Hill College also has a Quidditch team. The Chestnut Hill College Griffins placed third at the 2008 Intercollegiate Quidditch Association World Cup and earned first place at the 2014 Brotherly Love Cup. They host an annual Harry Potter Festival in mid- to late October.

<text>A memorial cross (sometimes called an intending cross) is a cross-shaped memorial to commemorate a special event or an incident, typically where one or more people died. It may also be a simple form of headstone to commemorate the dead.

==File==
In England, King Edward I had memorial crosses, the so-called Eleanor Crosses, erected in memory of his wife Eleanor of Castile who died in November 1290. Three of the original twelve crosses have survived.

In Germany today, the custom has arisen of erecting crosses (&quot;Unfallkreuze&quot; or &quot;accident crosses&quot;) as roadside memorials at the spot where someone has been killed. These are maintained for shorter or longer periods of time and decorated e.g. with flowers or candles. In South Germany, especially in Bavaria, memorial crosses exist for those who died several generations ago. Some of these crosses are at very remote places. These, too, usually commemorate a fatal accident. These roadside memorial crosses should not be confused with wayside crosses, which are erected in the Bavarian region on the edge of paths and tracks, and are there simply to give walkers the opportunity to say a short prayer.

In the US, makeshift crosses are often placed at the scenes of car accidents where someone died, or at the scene of a death due to violence. White crosses are frequently seen along interstate highways and other roads. Friends, family, or other visitors may decorate the area with photos of the deceased, flowers, toys (when the deceased was a small child), and other meaningful memorabilia. Other memorial crosses commemorate war dead and victims of terrorism.

The tallest memorial cross in the world at 152.4 metres is the Monumento Nacional de Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caidos near El Escorial in Spain.

<doc id="1317694" wikidata="Q7168264" url="?curid=1317694" title="Performance studies">
<text>Performance studies is an interdisciplinary academic field that teaches the development of performance skills and uses performance as a lens and a tool to study the world. The term &quot;performance&quot; is broad, and can include artistic and aesthetic performances like concerts, theatrical events, and performance art; sporting events; social, political and religious events like rituals, ceremonies, proclamations and public decisions; certain kinds of language use; and those components of identity which require someone to do, rather than just be, something. Performance studies draws from theories and methods of the performing arts, anthropology, sociology, literary theory, culture studies, communication, and others.

Performance studies tends to concentrate on a mix of research methods. The application of practice-led or practice-based research methods has become a widespread phenomenon not just in the anglophone world. As such research projects integrate established methods like literature research and oral history with performance practice, i.e. artistic auto-ethnographic approaches and verbatim theatre. The documentation of &quot;Practice-as-Research in Performance&quot; (PARIP), a devoted research project conducted at the University of Bristol between 2001 and 2006, offers a number of inspiring articles and portraits of such research projects and was key for a breakthrough of using creative thinking within this subject field.

==Origins and basic concepts==
Performance studies has been charged as an emerging discipline. As an academic field it is difficult to pin down; which could be the nature of the field itself or it is still too young to tell. In either case, many academics have been critical of its instability. There are, however, numerous degree-granting programs that train researchers being offered by universities. Some have referred to it as an &quot;inter discipline&quot; or a &quot;post discipline.&quot;

Scholars in today&#x27;s field of performance studies may trace their roots to a number of other fields such as elocution, interpretation, theatre, anthropology, and speech communication. According to Diana Taylor, &quot;what they have in common is their shared object of study: performance—in the broadest possible sense—as a process, praxis, and episteme, a mode of transmission, an accomplishment, and a means of intervening in the world.&quot;

Richard Schechner states that performance studies examine performances in two categories, the first being &quot;artistic performance&quot;, marked and understood as art. This includes solo-performance, performance art, performance of literature, theatrical storytelling, plays, and performance poetry. Artistic performance considers performance as an art form. The second category is &quot;cultural performance&quot;, which includes events that occur in everyday life, in which a culture&#x27;s values are displayed for their perpetuation: rituals such as parades, religious ceremonies, community festivals, controversial storytelling, and performances of social and professional roles, and individual performances of race, gender, sexuality and class are all considered a form of cultural performance.

===Elocution===
The oldest roots of performance studies are in elocution, sometimes referred to as declamation. This early approach to public speech delivery focused on verbal diction, physical gestures, stance, tone, and even dress. A revival of its practices during the eighteenth century, also known as The Elocution Movement, contributed to the emergence of Elocution as an academic discipline in its own right. One of the major figures of the Elocution Movement was actor and scholar Thomas Sheridan. Sheridan&#x27;s lectures on elocution, collected in Lectures on Elocution (1762) and his Lectures on Reading (1775), provided directions for marking and reading aloud passages from literature. Another actor, John Walker, published his two-volume Elements of Elocution in 1781, which provided detailed instruction on voice control, gestures, pronunciation, and emphasis.

The elocution movement took hold in the West; schools and departments of elocution and oratory cropped up across England and the United States throughout much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Most significant of these to performance studies today is the Northwestern University School of Oratory, established in 1894 by Robert McLean Cumnock to teach speech education on the principles of elocution. The School of Oratory housed their Department of Interpretation which focused on literature and on the art of interpretation as a means of understanding literature and bringing it to life through oral reading. In 1984, the Department of Interpretation was named the Department of Performance Studies to incorporate a broader definition of texts.

===Oral interpretation of literature===
On the literature front, Wallace Bacon (1914–2001) was considered by many to be someone who pioneered performance theory. Bacon taught performance of literature as the ultimate act of humility. In his defining statement of performance theory, &quot;Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students [and performers and audiences] through the power of texts&quot; (&quot;Literature in Performance&quot;, Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p. 84).

In addition, Robert Breen&#x27;s text &quot;Chamber Theatre&quot; is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist Barbara Browning has suggested that narrative fiction itself—and particularly the novel—demands the performative participation of the reader.

===Theatre and anthropology===
On the theatrical and anthropological front, this origin is often regarded as the research collaborations of director Richard Schechner and anthropologist Victor Turner. This origin narrative emphasizes a definition of performance as being &quot;between theatre and anthropology&quot; and often stresses the importance of intercultural performances as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork.

Dwight Conquergood developed a branch of performance ethnography that centered the political nature of the practice and advocated for methodological dialogism from the point of encounter to the practices of research reporting.

Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett has contributed an interest in tourist productions and ethnographic showmanship to the field, Judd Case has adapted performance to the study of media and religion, Diana Taylor has brought a hemispheric perspective on Latin American performance and theorized the relationship between the archive and the performance repertoire, while Corinne Kratz developed a mode of performance analysis that emphasizes the role of multimedia communication in performance. Laurie Frederik argues for the importance of ethnographic research and a solid theoretical base in anthropological perspective.

===Speech-act theory and performativity===

An alternative origin narrative stresses the development of speech-act theory by philosophers J. L. Austin and Judith Butler, literary critic Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and also Shoshana Felman. The theory proposed by Austin in &quot;How To Do Things With Words&quot; states that &quot;to say something &quot;is to do something&quot;, or &quot;in&quot; saying something we do something, and even &quot;by&quot; saying something we do something&quot;. the most illustrative example being &quot;I do&quot;, as part of a marriage ceremony. For any of these performative utterances to be felicitous, per Austin, they must be true, appropriate and conventional according to those with the proper authority: a priest, a judge, or the scholar, for instance. Austin accounts for the infelicitous by noting that &quot;there will always occur difficult or marginal cases where nothing in the previous history of a conventional procedure will decide conclusively whether such a procedure is or is not correctly applied to such a case&quot;. The possibility of failure in performatives (utterances made with language and the body) is taken up by Butler and is understood as the &quot;political promise of the performative&quot;. Her argument is that because the performative needs to maintain conventional power, convention itself has to be reiterated, and in this reiteration it can be expropriated by the unauthorized usage and thus create new futures. She cites Rosa Parks as an example:
When Rosa Parks sat in the front of the bus, she had no prior right to do so guaranteed by any…conventions of the South. And yet, in laying claim to the right for which she had no prior authorization, she endowed a certain authority on the act, and began the insurrectionary process of overthrowing those established codes of legitimacy.
The question of the infelicitous utterance (the misfire) is also taken up by Shoshana Felman when she states &quot;Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it. In other words ... Austin conceives of failure not as external but as internal to the promise, as what actually constitutes it.&quot;

===Other fields===
Performance studies has also had a strong relationship to the fields of feminism, psychoanalysis, critical race theory and queer theory. Theorists like Peggy Phelan, José Esteban Muñoz, E. Patrick Johnson, Rebecca Schneider, and André Lepecki have been equally influential in both performance studies and these related fields.

==Academic programs==

Performance studies incorporates theories of drama, dance, art, anthropology, folkloristics, philosophy, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, comparative literature, communication studies, and increasingly, music performance.

The first academic department with the name &quot;Performance Studies&quot; started at NYU in 1980. Shortly after in 1984 Northwestern University renamed its long-standing Department of Interpretation as the &quot;Department of Performance Studies;&quot; finally reflect their broadened definition of text and performance. Generally the differences between the NYU and Northwestern models cite different disciplinary concerns, however, in both instances a focus on practice lead to research methodologies and theories beyond theatre or literature in relation to or in service of understanding performance. For more information on the different origins and disciplinary traditions of performance studies see Shannon Jackson&#x27;s book &quot;Professing Performance&quot; and the introductory chapter in Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer&#x27;s &quot;Teaching Performance Studies&quot;.

In the United States, the interdisciplinary and multi-focus field has spread to Columbia, Brown, UCLA, UCI, UC Berkeley, and elsewhere. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered at The University of Texas at Austin, UCLA&#x27;s Culture and Performance Program, UC Davis, UC Irvine, Kennesaw State University, Louisiana State University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, California State University, Northridge, San Jose State University, University of San Diego, University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and Washington University in St. Louis. Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s Department of Performance Studies is unique in including both Music and Theatre degree programs.

In the United Kingdom Aberystwyth University offers a degree scheme in performance studies with highly acclaimed performance artists such as Mike Pearson, Heike Roms and Jill Greenhalgh. The University of Roehampton in London offers a BA in drama, Theatre and Performance Studies. Richmond University, London also offers a BA in Performance and Theatre Arts. The University of Plymouth has offered a BA in Theatre &amp; Performance since the early 1990s; its postgraduate research programme (ResM and MPhil/PhD) specialises in performance studies. The University of Warwick also offers a BA in Theatre and Performance Studies, in addition to leading Postgraduate programmes. More recently, the Guildford School of Acting has offered a BA in Theatre and Performance. Part of the conservatoire, the course focused on investigating performance practically, with strong emphasis on the idea of Practice as Research. The programme was led by Dr Laura Cull, founder of the now multinational Centre for Performance Philosophy; a new strand of performance studies which attempts to develop the relationship between philosophy and performance.

In Denmark Roskilde University offers a master and ph.d. degree in &quot;performance design&quot;, focusing on subjects such as theatrical performances, live music, festivals, and urban performances.

In Germany University of Hamburg offers a master program in performance studies at the centre for performance studies run by Gabriele Klein. The Centre for Performance Studies at the University of Bremen offers a certificate in performance studies focussing on the combination of academic and artistic research within performance projects.

In Poland, Jagiellonian University in Kraków offers a master program in performance studies at the Faculty of Polish Language and Literature.

In India, Jawaharlal Nehru University offers MPhil and PhD program in theatre &amp; performance studies at the School of Arts &amp; Aesthetics. Since 2012, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, Ambedkar University Delhi, started a MA program in performance studies, which focus on redefining methodologies of cultural studies and research on the basis of the nuances of performance studies. It is formulating the first Practice based PhD in the country and working extensively in the realm of Practice-as-Research. On the similar lines, the Centre for Performance Research and Cultural Studies in South Asia (CPRACSIS), Kerala have organized series of workshops and seminars over the last few years to engage scholars, artists and practitioners in conversation informed by performance studies.

In Australia, the University of Sydney, Victoria University and Queensland University of Technology offer degrees majoring in performance studies, honours, masters and PhD. Performance studies in some countries is also an A-level (AS and A2) course consisting of the integration of the discrete art forms of Dance, Music and Drama in performing arts.

In Brazil, the Universidade Federal de Goiás, started an interdisciplinary program (masters) in cultural performances in 2012, the first in a Latin country. The goal of this program is to analyse &quot;rituals, games, performances, drama, dance&quot; from a cross-cultural point of view.

<text>Guðbrandur Þorláksson or Gudbrand Thorlakssøn ( – 20 July 1627) was bishop of Hólar from 8 April 1571 until his death. He was the longest-serving bishop in Iceland and is known for printing the &quot;Guðbrandsbiblía&quot;, first complete Icelandic translation of the Bible.

==Early life==
Guðbrandur was the son of Þorláks Hallgrímssonar, a priest based at in Miðfjörður, and Helga Jónsdóttir, the daughter of the lawyer . Guðbrandur studied at Hólar College from 1553 to 1559 and then went to the University of Copenhagen where he studied theology and logic. Guðbrandur was one of the first Icelanders to study in Denmark instead of in Germany. After returning to Iceland in 1564, he served as rector of the Skálholt School for three years before becoming a priest at historic Breiðabólstaður in Vesturhóp.

==Bishop==
In 1571, the Danish King Frederick II named Guðbrandur Bishop of Hólar on the recommendation of Poul Madsen, bishop of Zealand, who had been his teacher in Copenhagen. Guðbrandur served as bishop of Hólar for 56 years; no Icelander has held the position longer.

As bishop, Guðbrandur focused on cementing the Reformation in Iceland in part by working to publish holy works in Icelandic. He brought the printing press originally brought to Iceland by the Catholic priest Jón Arason to Hólar, printing nearly 100 books during his time as bishop. He wrote and translated many works himself, including hymns and The Bible. Thanks to his printing work, as well as his focus on ensuring accuracy in translation, Guðbrandur is credited with helping strengthen the Icelandic language.

Printing of the Guðbrandsbiblía, or &quot;Guðbrandur&#x27;s Bible,&quot; was completed in 1584. Portions included previous translations, including Oddur Gottskálksson&#x27;s translation of the New Testament, along with new translations by Guðbrandur based on Latin, Germany, and Danish translations. Although he worked with trained printers, Guðbrandur engraved some of the book&#x27;s adornments himself. Five hundred copies were printed, which were sold for the price of two or three cows. The Guðbrandsbiblía was the basis for most Icelandic biblical translations until 1826.

Other works published by Guðbrandur include a translation of Niels Hemmingsen&#x27;s &quot; Liffsens Vey&quot; (&quot;Way of Life&quot;) in 1575, the first Icelandic hymnal in 1589, an Icelandic Gradual in 1594, and the &quot;Vísnabók&quot;, a collection of spiritual songs, in 1612. He also published several writings by Arngrímur Jónsson.

Guðbrandur was a well-rounded scholar with an interest in natural history, astronomy, and surveying, among other fields. This led to his drafting of a new map of Iceland, which was published in Abraham Ortelius&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; in 1590, as well as fixing the location of the island in the North Atlantic with greater accuracy than previous maps. He also worked to ensure descriptions of Iceland were presented accurately to the world.

==Personal life==
Soon after becoming bishop, Guðbrandur had a child with Guðrún Gísladóttir. Their daughter, Steinunn Guðbrandsdóttir, married the farmer Skúla Einarsson, and one of Skúla and Steinunn&#x27;s sons, Þorlákur Skúlason, succeeded Guðbrandur as bishop of Hólar. On 7 September 1572, Guðbrandur married on Halldóra Árnadóttir (1547–1585), the daughter of Árni Gíslason, magistrate of Hlíðarenda, and Guðrún Sæmundsdóttir. Their children included Páll Guðbrandsson (1573–1621), Halldóra Guðbrandsdóttir (1574–1658), and Kristín Guðbrandsdóttir (1574–1652).

==50 króna banknote==
In 1981, the Central Bank of Iceland introduced a new series of banknotes with Guðbrandur on the front of the note and a fragment of the Guðbrandsbiblía and an image of early printers at work on the reverse. In 1987, the paper banknote was replaced with an coin.

<doc id="1317701" wikidata="Q555" url="?curid=1317701" title="Rachel Maddow">
<text>Rachel Anne Maddow ( ; born April 1, 1973) is an American television news program host and liberal political commentator. She hosts &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, a weekly television show on MSNBC, and serves as the cable network&#x27;s special event co-anchor. Her syndicated talk radio program of the same name aired on Air America Radio from 2005 to 2010. 

Maddow has received multiple Emmy Awards for her broadcasting work; in 2021, she also received a Grammy Award for the audiobook version of &quot;Blowout&quot; (2019).

Maddow holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in public policy from Stanford University and a doctorate in political science from the University of Oxford and is the first openly lesbian anchor to host a major prime-time news program in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Maddow was born in Castro Valley, California. Her father, Robert B. Maddow, is a former United States Air Force captain who resigned his commission the year before her birth and then worked as a lawyer for the East Bay Municipal Utility District. Her mother, Elaine (née Gosse), was a school program administrator. She has one older brother, David. Her paternal grandfather was from a Jewish family (the original family surname being &quot;Medvedof&quot;), who arrived in the United States from the Russian Empire. Her paternal grandmother was of Dutch descent. Maddow&#x27;s Canadian mother, originally from Newfoundland and Labrador, has English and Irish ancestry.

Maddow has said her family is &quot;very, very Catholic&quot; and she grew up in a community that her mother has described as &quot;very conservative&quot;. Maddow was a competitive athlete and participated in high school volleyball, basketball, and swimming.

Referring to John Hughes films, Maddow has described herself as being &quot;a cross between the jock and the antisocial girl&quot; in high school. She is a graduate of Castro Valley High School and attended Stanford University. While a freshman, she was outed as a lesbian by the college newspaper when an interview with her was published before she could tell her parents.

She earned a degree in public policy at Stanford in 1994. At graduation, she was awarded the John Gardner Fellowship. She was the recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship and began her postgraduate study in 1995 at Lincoln College, Oxford. She had also been awarded a Marshall Scholarship the same year but turned it down in favor of the Rhodes. This made her the first openly lesbian winner of the Rhodes Scholarship. In 2001, she earned a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) in politics at the University of Oxford. Her thesis was titled &quot;HIV/AIDS and Health Care Reform in British and American Prisons&quot; and was supervised by Lucia Zedner.

==Radio==
Maddow&#x27;s first job as a radio host was in 1999 at WRNX (100.9 FM) in Holyoke, Massachusetts, then home to &quot;The Dave in the Morning Show&quot;. She entered and won a contest the station held to find a new second lead for the show&#x27;s principal host, Dave Brinnel. After the WRNX show, she hosted &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; on WRSI in Northampton, Massachusetts, for two years, leaving in 2004 to join the new Air America radio network. There she hosted &quot;Unfiltered&quot; along with Chuck D (of the hip hop group Public Enemy) and Lizz Winstead (co-creator of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;) until its cancellation in March 2005. 

Two weeks after the cancellation of &quot;Unfiltered&quot; in April 2005, Maddow&#x27;s weekday two-hour radio program, &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, began airing; in March 2008 it gained a third hour, broadcasting from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, with David Bender filling in the third hour for the call-in section, when Maddow was on TV assignment. In 2008, the show&#x27;s length returned to two hours when Maddow began the nightly MSNBC television program, also called &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;. Early in 2009, after renewing her contract with Air America, Maddow&#x27;s radio show was moved to a one-hour timeslot at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time. This iteration of the show began with a short introduction from Maddow followed by a broadcast based on the audio from the previous night&#x27;s MSNBC broadcast of Maddow&#x27;s television show. Little explanation or warning was given for this shift except for Maddow&#x27;s comments that doing two daily shows was far too taxing.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews/1.388701&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Maddow&#x27;s radio show ended on January 21, 2010 when Air America ceased operations.

==Television==
In June 2005, Maddow became a regular panelist on the MSNBC show &quot;Tucker,&quot; hosted by Tucker Carlson. During and after the November 2006 election, she was a guest on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Paula Zahn Now&quot;; she was also a correspondent for &quot;The Advocate Newsmagazine&quot;, an LGBT-oriented short-form newsmagazine for Logo deriving from news items published by &quot;The Advocate&quot;. In January 2008, Maddow became an MSNBC political analyst and was a regular panelist on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Race for the White House&quot; with David Gregory and MSNBC&#x27;s election coverage as well as a frequent contributor on &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann.&quot;

In 2008, Maddow was the substitute host for &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, her first time hosting a program on MSNBC. Maddow described herself on-air as &quot;nervous&quot;. Keith Olbermann complimented her work, and she was brought back to host &quot;Countdown&quot; the next month. The show she hosted was the highest-rated news program among people aged 25 to 54. For her success, Olbermann ranked Maddow third in his show&#x27;s segment &quot;World&#x27;s Best Persons&quot;. In July 2008, Maddow filled in again for several broadcasts. Maddow also filled in for David Gregory as host of &quot;Race for the White House&quot;.

Olbermann advocated for Maddow to host her own show at MSNBC, and he was eventually able to persuade Phil Griffin to give her Dan Abrams&#x27; time slot.

===&quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;===
In August 2008, MSNBC announced &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; would replace &quot;Verdict with Dan Abrams&quot; in the network&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. slot the following month. Following its debut, the show topped &quot;Countdown&quot; as the highest-rated show on MSNBC on several occasions. After being on air for more than a month, Maddow&#x27;s program doubled the audience that hour. This show made Maddow the first openly gay or lesbian host of a primetime news program in the United States.

The initial reviews for the show were positive. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Matea Gold&lt;ref name=&quot;adweek/25144&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that Maddow &quot;finds the right formula on MSNBC&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Maddow had become the &quot;star of America&#x27;s cable news&quot;. Associated Press columnist David Bauder saw her as &quot;[Keith] Olbermann&#x27;s political soul mate&quot;, and he described the Olbermann-Maddow shows as a &quot;liberal two-hour block&quot;.

Of her collegial relationship with Roger Ailes of Fox News, whom she sought out for technical advice, on camera angles, Maddow said she does not want to talk about it because &quot;I don&#x27;t want anybody else to use it. It was a nice thing that he did for me, and it&#x27;s been valuable for me; it helped me get an advantage over my competitors.&quot;

In mid-May 2017, amid multiple controversies surrounding the Trump administration, MSNBC surpassed CNN and Fox News in the news ratings. For the week of May 15, &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; was the No. 1 non-sports program on cable for the first time. She has been called by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;America&#x27;s wonkiest anchor&quot; who &quot;cut through the chaos of the Trump administrationand became the most trusted name in the news.&quot; Maddow has argued that these issues &quot;are the most serious scandals that any president has ever faced.&quot;

Maddow has stated that her show&#x27;s mission is to &quot;[i]ncrease the amount of useful information in the world&quot;. She said her rule for covering the Trump administration is: &quot;Don&#x27;t pay attention to what they say, focus on what they do ... because it&#x27;s easier to cover a fast-moving story when you&#x27;re not distracted by whatever the White House denials are.&quot;

Maddow often begins a broadcast with a lengthy story, sometimes longer than 20 minutes, which she has referred to on-air as the &quot;A-block.&quot; This often begins with film clips and other media from events in past years or decades which she eventually connects with the news of the day. About this process, she has said: &quot;The thing that defines whether or not you&#x27;re good at this work is whether you have something to say when it&#x27;s time to say something. Because you&#x27;re going to have to say something when that light goes on ... I want to have something to say that people don&#x27;t already know every single night, every single segment, and that makes it hard to get the process right because that&#x27;s the only thing I care about.&quot;

Maddow was an outspoken advocate of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during 2021. She encouraged people to get vaccinated, for the benefit of themselves and others.

Maddow took a hiatus from her show from February to April 2022 to coincide with production on the film adaptation of &quot;Bag Man&quot;. As of May 2022, her show has moved to a weekly broadcast on Mondays.

====&quot;Herring Networks, Inc. v. Rachel Maddow, et al.&quot;====
On September 10, 2019, the One America News Network (OAN) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Maddow for $10 million, after Maddow described the network as &quot;paid Russian propaganda&quot; on her program on July 22. Maddow had repeated a &quot;Daily Beast&quot; story which identified an OAN employee as also working for Sputnik News, which is owned by the Russian government-owned news agency Rossiya Segodnya, and has been accused of deliberately disseminating disinformation, and is often described as an outlet for propaganda. Also named in the suit were Comcast, MSNBC, and NBCUniversal Media.

On May 22, 2020, the case was dismissed by Judge Cynthia Bashant, who found that &quot;the contested statement is an opinion that cannot serve as the basis for a defamation&quot;. OAN parent company Herring Networks said they planned to appeal.

After considering Herring&#x27;s appeal, in August 2021, the decision in favor of Maddow was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit. The Court of Appeals also affirmed a trial court ruling that requires Herring to pay Maddow&#x27;s attorneys&#x27; fees.

==Writing==
Maddow wrote &quot;&quot; (2012) about the role of the military in postwar American politics. Upon its release, &quot;Drift&quot; reached the first position of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.

In December 2013, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; announced that Maddow would write a monthly opinion column for the paper, contributing one article per month over a period of six months.

On March 2, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published Maddow&#x27;s first crossword puzzle, in collaboration with Joe DiPietro. On the eve of its publication, she said: &quot;This is kind of it, like there will never be a baby, but there&#x27;s this freaking crossword puzzle, and I am very, very excited about it.&quot;

Maddow&#x27;s second book &quot;Blowout: Corrupted Democracy, Rogue State Russia, and the Richest, Most Destructive Industry on Earth&quot; was published in October 2019. In March 2021, the audiobook version of &quot;Blowout&quot;, recorded by Maddow, won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.

Her third book, &quot;Bag Man: The Wild Crimes, Audacious Cover-up, and Spectacular Downfall of a Brazen Crook in the White House&quot;, written with Michael Yarvitz, was published in December 2020.

Maddow&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;&quot; was published on October 17, 2023. It is based on her podcast &quot;Ultra&quot;.

== Podcasting ==
In October 2018, Maddow launched the podcast &quot;Bag Man&quot;, produced with MSNBC and focusing on the 1973 political scandal surrounding Vice President Spiro Agnew. A film adaptation of the podcast was announced to be in production in 2022, with Ben Stiller attached to direct and Lorne Michaels to produce, with Maddow set to be an executive producer.

In October 2022, Maddow and MSNBC launched &quot;Ultra&quot;, a podcast series chronicling U.S. right-wing extremism during the 1940s and World War II, including the 1944 sedition trial. A few months later, in December, famed filmmaker Steven Spielberg&#x27;s company optioned film rights to the series.

==Public image and publicity==

A 2011 &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; profile of Maddow said she was able to deliver news &quot;with agenda, but not hysteria&quot;. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; profile said, &quot;At her best, Maddow debates ideological opponents with civility and persistence ... but for all her eloquence, she can get so wound up ripping Republicans that she sounds like another smug cable partisan&quot;. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; critic Howard Kurtz accused Maddow of acting like &quot;a lockstep party member&quot;. The editors of &quot;The New Republic&quot; similarly criticized hernaming her among the &quot;most over-rated thinkers&quot; of 2011, they called her program &quot;a textbook example of the intellectual limitations of a perfectly settled perspective&quot;. 
On awarding her the Interfaith Alliance&#x27;s Faith and Freedom Award named for Walter Cronkite, Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy remarked that &quot;Rachel&#x27;s passionate coverage of the intersection of religion and politics exhibits a strong personal intellect coupled with constitutional sensitivity to the proper boundaries between religion and government.&quot;

Similarly, a 2008 &quot;Time&quot; profile described Maddow a &quot;whip-smart, button-cute leftie&quot;. It said she radiates an essential decency and suggested her career rise might signify that &quot;nice is the new nasty&quot;.

Distinguishing herself from others on the left, Maddow has said she is a &quot;national security liberal&quot; and, in a different interview, that she is not &quot;a partisan&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her a &quot;defense policy wonk&quot;.

==Political views==
When asked about her political views in 2010 by the &quot;Valley Advocate&quot;, Maddow replied, &quot;I&#x27;m undoubtedly a liberal, which means that I&#x27;m in almost total agreement with the Eisenhower-era Republican Party platform.&quot;

Maddow opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In February 2013, she said:

We say that Vietnam changed our politics forever. But less than 40 years after this, again, a campaign directed at the highest levels of government to get us to agree to a war based on something that did not happen the way they said it happened. It was a months-long campaign in 2002 and 2003, and it worked ... In three weeks, the CIA pulls together what normally takes months. It is delivered just seven days before the congressional vote ... By the end of 2002, the U.S. military is headed to the Gulf. Congress is on board, as are British Prime Minister Tony Blair and most of the mainstream media. The stage is set for war.

During the 2008 presidential election, Maddow did not formally support any candidate. Concerning Barack Obama&#x27;s candidacy, Maddow said: &quot;I have never and still don&#x27;t think of myself as an Obama supporter, either professionally or actually.&quot;

In 2010, Republican Senator Scott Brown speculated that Maddow was going to run against him in the 2012 Senate election. His campaign used this premise for a fundraising email, although Maddow repeatedly said Brown&#x27;s speculation was false. Brown continued to make his claims in the Boston media, so Maddow ran a full-page advertisement in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; confirming that she was not running and separately demanded Brown&#x27;s apology. She added that, despite repeated invitations over the months, Brown had refused to appear on her TV program. Ultimately, it was Elizabeth Warren who ran in 2012, defeating Brown.

Maddow has suggested that the alleged Trump-Russia collusion has continued beyond the 2016 presidential election. In March 2017, she blamed Russia for WikiLeaks&#x27; Vault 7 disclosure of the CIA&#x27;s hacking tools, saying: &quot;Consider what the other U.S. agency is besides the State Department that Putin most hates? That Putin most feels competitive with? That Putin most wants to beat? It&#x27;s the CIA, right? ... Smart observers say this is the largest dump of classified CIA material maybe ever, and it really could be a devastating blow to the CIA&#x27;s cyber war and flat-out spying capabilities, and that dump was released by WikiLeaks.&quot; Regarding the Trump-Russia investigation, Maddow said: &quot;If the Trump presidency is knowingly the product of a foreign-intelligence operation, that is a full-stop national crisis.&quot; Concerning &quot;alternative facts&quot; and fake news, Maddow said: &quot;The president denigrating the press is important in terms of his behavior as an increasingly authoritarian-style leader, period.&quot;

Following the October 2018 murder of Saudi Arabian dissident journalist and &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Maddow argued that Donald Trump&#x27;s business ties to Saudi Arabia were raising some troubling questions.

In December 2018, Maddow criticized President Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.

In July 2020, Maddow predicted that unemployment figures covering the previous month would be &quot;absolutely terrible&quot;; after the figures were released, showing the largest growth in employment in a single month in U.S. history, &quot;Politico&quot; named Maddow&#x27;s prediction one of &quot;the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year&quot;.

In May 2021, former &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Barry Meier published &quot;Spooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube, and the Rise of Private Spies&quot;, which cited the Steele dossier as a case study in how reporters can be manipulated by private intelligence sources. Meier named Maddow as one example.

==Personal life==
Maddow splits her time between Manhattan in New York City, and West Cummington, Massachusetts, with her partner, artist Susan Mikula. They met in 1999, when Maddow was working on her doctoral dissertation.

Maddow has dealt with cyclical depression since puberty. In a 2012 interview, she stated, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t take away from my joy or my work or my energy, but coping with depression is something that is part of the everyday way that I live and have lived for as long as I can remember.&quot; She has explained why she decided to speak about it in interviews: &quot;It was a hard call ... Because it was nobody&#x27;s business. But it had been helpful to me to learn about the people who were surviving, were leading good lives, even though they were dealing with depression. So I felt it was a bit of a responsibility to pay that back.&quot;

Maddow said, &quot;There are three things I do to stay sane: I exercise, I sleepI&#x27;m a good sleeperand I fish.&quot; She is also a practicing Catholic.

In 2021, Maddow had surgery to remove a cancerous skin growth from her neck.

<doc id="1317708" wikidata="Q1392642" url="?curid=1317708" title="Indiana House of Representatives">
<text>The Indiana House of Representatives is the lower house of the Indiana General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Indiana. The House is composed of 100 members representing an equal number of constituent districts. House members serve two-year terms without term limits. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, each State House district contains an average of 64,838 people.

The House convenes at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis.

Districts in Indiana are among the most gerrymandered in the United States - analysis showing that if Hoosier Republicans receive at least 56 percent of the statewide vote they will likely hold around 70 percent of seats.

==Terms and qualifications==
In order to run for a seat for the Indiana House of Representatives one must be a citizen of the United States, has to be at least 21 years of age upon taking office, and should reside in the state of Indiana for 2 years and in the district to represent for at least 1 year at the time of the election.

Representatives serve terms of two years, and there is no limit on how many terms a representative may serve.

==History==

The Indiana House of Representatives held its first session in the first statehouse in the original state capital of Corydon and the first speaker of the body was Isaac Blackford. Under the terms of the constitution of 1816, state representatives served one-year terms, meaning elections were held annually. In 1851, the constitution was replaced by the current constitution and terms were lengthened to two years, but sessions were held biennially. In 1897, it unanimously passed a bill determining the value of Pi to exactly 3.2. However, the bill was never voted upon in the State Senate. A 1972 constitutional amendment allowed for a short legislative session to be held in odd numbered years.

===2012 Election===
On November 6, 2012, the Republican Party in Indiana expanded their majority in the House of Representatives from 60 members in the 117th General Assembly to 69 members, a &quot;quorum-proof&quot; majority. The Republicans were able to take 69% of the seats, despite having only received approximately 54% of the votes for the state&#x27;s House of Representatives.

Of the 3 newly elected members of the U.S. House elected to the 113th Congress from Indiana, two are former members of the Indiana House of Representatives. Congresswoman Jackie Walorski (IN-02) represented Indiana&#x27;s 21st district from 2005 to 2011 and Congressman Luke Messer (IN-06) represented Indiana&#x27;s 57th district from 2003 to 2007. Congressman Marlin Stutzman (IN-03) was re-elected to a second term, he is a former member of the Indiana House of Representatives where he served Indiana&#x27;s 52nd district from 2003 to 2009.

<doc id="1317711" wikidata="Q5085056" url="?curid=1317711" title="Charlie Hurley">
<text>Charles John Hurley (4 October 1936 – 22 April 2024) was an Irish footballer who mainly played in the centre half position. Nicknamed &#x27;King&#x27;, Hurley was a defender for both Sunderland, where he was named as &quot;Player of the Century&quot; by his fans in 1979, and the Republic of Ireland. He ended his playing career at Bolton Wanderers and was later manager of Reading. Hurley died on 22 April 2024, at the age of 87.

==Early life==
Hurley was born in Cork, Ireland, and his family moved to in Essex, England, when Charlie was seven months old. He later survived The Blitz, in which one of his best friends was killed, and as a teenager worked as an apprentice toolmaker. His first offer of a football contract was from West Ham but he turned it down as he could earn more for his family by continuing with his apprenticeship. However, at the age of sixteen he did eventually accept a contract offer from Millwall.

==Playing career==

===Millwall===
Hurley began his football career at Millwall in 1953, making his debut at the age of seventeen in a 2–2 draw away to Torquay United on 30 January 1954. He went on to make 16 league appearances in the season. He followed this up with 38 league games in 1954–55 and also played three FA Cup ties. At the start of 1955–56, he represented London in the first English team to play in a European competition. London beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3–2 at Wembley in the Fairs Cup. He was thus selected to play for the Republic of Ireland at aged 20, but a cruciate knee ligament injury, whilst representing the army side on his national service, ended any such plans. He recovered, but for the rest of his career he had to be particularly careful when making a sliding tackle and required constant treatment on his left knee.

On 19 May 1957, Hurley made his Irish debut against England in Dublin.

In early October he was sold to Sunderland for a fee of £18,000. He was voted him the &#x27;best ever player&#x27; in the Millwall fanzine The Lion Roars prior to the Dockers Day at the New Den in 2007.

===Sunderland===
On 26 September 1957, Hurley arrived at Roker Park to begin a career that would span 12 seasons and 402 appearances.

Hurley&#x27;s Sunderland career had a disastrous start; a 7–0 rout by Blackpool, coupled with him scoring an own goal on his debut, which was quickly followed by a 6–0 defeat by Burnley. Hurley had been unfortunate enough to have competed against centre forwards who would later go on to represent England. Eventually promotion was achieved in the 1963–64 season after two campaigns which had seen Sunderland miss out on top flight football due to consecutive last day failures against Swansea Town and Chelsea.

It took 124 league and cup appearances for Sunderland before he broke his scoring duck. A 1–1 Boxing Day draw in 1960 against Sheffield United was the first of 43.

Whilst the 1963–64 season was special for Sunderland, resulting in promotion, it was also personally highly satisfactory for Hurley, who came second to Bobby Moore in voting for FWA Footballer of the Year.

In the late sixties, alongside Jimmy Montgomery, Cecil Irwin, Len Ashurst, Martin Harvey and Jim McNab, Hurley formed one of the most notable and most settled back fives in Sunderland&#x27;s history.

Alan Brown&#x27;s departure from Roker Park, to take over at Sheffield Wednesday saw first George Hardwick and then Scotsman Ian McColl take over. During one match at Old Trafford in November 1966, first Hurley, and then Northern Ireland defender John Parke went in goal, as Montgomery had to leave the game because of an injury sustained in the first half.

Hurley&#x27;s last goal for Sunderland came against Arsenal in April 1968, typically a header. His last appearance in a red and white shirt was at Turf Moor, Burnley in April 1969.

In the FA Cup 5th round victory at Carrow Road in February 1961, he scored the only goal to dump Norwich City out of the competition. Sunderland would then go on to succumb to a Danny Blanchflower-inspired Tottenham Hotspur side, who became double winners for the first time in the 20th century.

In a poll on the occasion of the club&#x27;s centenary in 1979, Sunderland fans voted him their player of the century.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 2 June 1969, Hurley moved to Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer. He spent three years at Burnden Park and was a well-liked figure in the heart of the defence, so much so that he was given the opportunity to manage the club upon the departure of Jimmy Meadows only to reluctantly turn the chance down because his wife missed living in the South of England.

==International career==
He played 40 times for the Republic of Ireland and was their most-capped player at the time of his final appearance in 1969.

==Managerial career==
From 1972 to 1977 Hurley managed Reading, then based at Elm Park. In the 4th round of the FA Cup in February 1972 he guided Reading, then a 4th division club, to a 4th-round meeting with Arsenal. Over 20,000 people packed into Elm Park, and Hurley&#x27;s charges narrowly lost 2–1 to a side containing George Graham, Charlie George, Geordie Armstrong, Bob Wilson, Frank McLintock and other international-class players. Reading finished the season in sixteenth place in Division 4. During the 1972–73 season Hurley enjoyed an emotional &#x27;home coming&#x27; when took his side to face Sunderland at Roker Park in the fourth round of the FA Cup. After a 1–1 draw, Sunderland won the replay 3–1. The following spring the Reading manager took a gamble by purchasing Robin Friday from non-league Hayes In 1975–76 Reading won promotion. Hurley quit on 26 February 1977. This was an historic moment as it was the first time a Football League manager had resigned at half time.

<text>The Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) is a rail trail between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cumberland, Maryland. Together with the C&amp;O Canal towpath, the GAP is part of a route between Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., that is popular with through hikers and cyclists.

== History ==
The GAP follows former right-of-way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, Union Railroad, and Western Maryland Railway.

The first section of the GAP— near Ohiopyle—opened in 1986. The section between Woodcock Hollow and Cumberland opened on December 13, 2006. The GAP was completed in 2013 when the section between West Homestead and Point State Park in Pittsburgh opened. The completion project was named &quot;The Point Made&quot;, reflecting the fact that it was now possible to reach Point State Park from Washington, D.C. Celebrations took place on June 15, 2013. With its opening, Pennsylvania became the state with the most rail trails—, with more under development.

The overall construction cost for the GAP was $80 million.

The Allegheny Trail Alliance (ATA) was founded in 1995 as an umbrella organization for the GAP&#x27;s seven trail organizations, which include Friends of the Riverfront, Steel Valley Trail, Regional Trail Corporation, Ohiopyle State Park, and Mountain Maryland Trails. Each organization maintains a particular section of the GAP. The ATA was later renamed The Great Allegheny Passage Conservancy.

The original name for the GAP was &quot;Cumberland and Pittsburgh Trail&quot;. &quot;Great Allegheny Passage&quot; was selected in 2001 by the ATA after six years and more than 100 proposals as a name evocative of the geography and historical heritage of the trail. It was suggested by Bill Metzger, editor of the ATA newsletter. The runner-up was &quot;Allegheny Frontier Trail&quot;.

==Route==

The GAP&#x27;s route is composed of several shorter trails including the Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland, Allegheny Highlands Trail of Pennsylvania, Youghiogheny River Trail, Steel Valley Trail, and Three Rivers Heritage Trail. The GAP also includes the Mountour Trail, a branch that serves Pittsburgh International Airport.

The segment of the GAP between Ohiopyle and Cumberland is part of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail, one of eight nationally designated scenic trails. It is also part of the September 11th National Memorial Trail.

===Points of interest===
Notable landmarks along the GAP include:
* Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh, where the Allegheny River meets the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River

* Big Savage Tunnel, , the lit tunnel, carries the trail through Big Savage Mountain two miles east of the Eastern Continental Divide with a scenic vista just east of the tunnel—closed December 1 to April 1 for protection from seasonal snow and ice. Approximate dates, based on seasonal conditions. No easy road bypass.
* Mason–Dixon line: where the trail crosses the Pennsylvania - Maryland state border
* Borden Tunnel: long, unlighted.
* Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, a working steam railroad operating next to the trail from Cumberland, Maryland to the college town of Frostburg, Maryland (and return), along the original trackage of the Western Maryland Railway.

<text>Christian Eduard Dailly (born 23 October 1973) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

Dailly started his professional career as a teenager, playing as a striker for Dundee United. He helped them win the 1993–94 Scottish Cup. Towards the end of his time with United, Dailly began playing as a centre-back. He moved to English Premier League club Derby County in 1996. After two seasons with Derby, Dailly moved to Blackburn Rovers for a transfer fee of £5,350,000. During his time with Blackburn, the club were relegated in 1999 and Dailly lost his place in the team.

He moved to West Ham United in 2001 for £1,700,000. During his time with West Ham, the club were relegated in 2003 but won promotion in 2005. Dailly appeared as a substitute in the 2006 FA Cup final, which West Ham lost on penalties to Liverpool. After a loan spell with Southampton, Dailly moved to Rangers in January 2008. He helped the team reach the 2008 UEFA Cup final. His final appearance for Rangers was as a substitute in the 2009 Scottish Cup final, which Rangers won 1–0 against Falkirk. After a two-year spell with Charlton Athletic and short stints with Portsmouth and Southend United, Dailly retired in 2012.

Dailly made 67 full international appearances for Scotland between 1997 and 2008. He was part of the Scotland squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Dailly is also the record cap-holder for the Scotland under-21 team, having made 35 appearances between 1990 and 1996.

==Club career==
===Dundee United===
Dailly was born in Dundee and first signed professional terms with Dundee United on 2 August 1990, aged sixteen years old. He became the youngest-ever player to appear for Dundee United when he made his first-team debut on 21 August 1990, though this record has since been broken by Greg Cameron. Playing as a striker and scoring in each of his first three games, Dailly quickly shot to prominence, making his Scotland Under 21 side debut just a month later. He won the Scottish Youth Cup with the club in 1990–91. In his debut season, Dailly managed five goals in eighteen appearances. His debut season would become his most prolific, and the 1991–92 season brought just eight games with no goals. In the 1992–93 season, Dailly scored four from fourteen appearances and firmly established himself as a regular in the 1993–94 season with 38 league appearances, and not only another four goals, but also the Scottish Cup, when his shot rebounded off the post for Craig Brewster to score the only goal against Rangers.

The 1994–95 season ended in disappointment with relegation, with yet another four goals from 33 games. In 1995–96, Dailly was firmly established as a centre-back and started the season as United&#x27;s club captain, although he was subsequently replaced by Dave Bowman. He scored just once in 30 appearances. It was an important goal though, as it ensured United drew the away leg of the short-lived league-playoff against Partick Thistle, and subsequently won the home leg to gain promotion at the first opportunity. This proved to be Dailly&#x27;s final game for Dundee United, as he joined Derby County in August 1996 for £500,000, with a further £500,000 payable dependent on his international career, which was later paid.

===Derby County===
Dailly joined Derby County at the start of the 1996–97 season, following Derby&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League. In his debut English season, Dailly missed just two games, with his three goals helping Derby to 12th place and six points clear of relegation. In the 1997–98 season, Dailly made 30 appearances and scored once; Derby fared even better, with the club finishing ninth and just two points from European football. In 1998–99, Dailly played just once, coincidentally against Blackburn Rovers, the club to which he was then transferred.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Dailly joined Rovers in August 1998 for £5.35m but a tumultuous season followed with Dailly not finding a settled position and an injury meaning he played just seventeen times. To make matters worse, Rovers were relegated from the Premier League as Dailly suffered relegation for the second time in his career. In the First Division, Dailly appeared 43 times in a hectic 1999–2000 season, which saw him score four goals. However, he fell out of favour with new boss Graeme Souness and in January 2001, after making just nine appearances that season, Dailly left for West Ham United in a £1.75m deal and returned to the Premier League. During his spell at Blackburn he played in a testimonial match for Celtic – scoring a late consolation goal against Liverpool in the Ronnie Moran testimonial match on 13 May 2000.

===West Ham United===
Following his transfer from Blackburn to the Hammers for a fee of £1.7m he made twelve appearances in 2000–01, helping the Hammers to 15th place. He also played in their 1–0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the FA Cup. The following season, Dailly played every minute of every game as West Ham finished in seventh place. 2002–03 proved to be a low point, as Dailly suffered relegation for a third time. Playing 26 times, West Ham were relegated with the highest number of points since the 1995–96 change to 20 teams, a total of 42.

Dailly was to go on and score twice from 43 games as West Ham finished in the Division One play-off positions in 2003–04. He scored the winner against Ipswich Town in the play-off semi-final to send them to the final but they failed to win promotion. Injury prevented Dailly from the majority of West Ham&#x27;s promotion-winning 2004–05 season, although he returned to make brief appearances in one play-off semi-final leg and the final. He signed a new deal with West Ham in June 2005. Dailly appeared as a substitute for West Ham in their 2006 FA Cup final defeat to Liverpool, coming on in the 77th minute. Despite being 2–0 ahead after 28 minutes, West Ham eventually lost on penalties. He was the longest serving West Ham player at the time of his departure and something of a cult hero to the fans.

===Southampton===
On 20 September 2007, he joined Southampton on loan, initially for a month. The loan was extended for a further month as Saints continued to suffer with injuries to several defensive players. He made his debut against Barnsley in a 3–2 home league defeat on 22 September 2007. After eleven appearances for Saints he returned to West Ham.

===Rangers===
On 30 January 2008, Dailly signed for Rangers on a short-term contract until the end of the season. The club took over what remained of his contract from West Ham United. He made his Rangers debut three weeks later in a UEFA Cup match against Panathinaikos; the game ended in a 1–1 and saw the club progress to the fourth round. He scored his first goal 9 days later, netting the equaliser in a 3–1 triumph over Aberdeen. On 3 July 2008, he and David Weir signed new one-year contract extensions with the club. Dailly continued to play as part of the Rangers squad as they progressed to the 2008 UEFA Cup Final in Manchester.

The arrival of Madjid Bougherra then saw Dailly lose his place in the team until an injury to Bougherra saw him included in Rangers&#x27; 2009 Scottish League Cup final squad. He played his final game for the club in the 2009 Scottish Cup final as an 87th-minute substitute helping Rangers retain the Scottish Cup in a 1–0 victory over Falkirk. He was released two days later on 1 June 2009. Dailly made 36 appearances in total and scored twice for Rangers.

===Charlton Athletic===
On 31 July 2009, Dailly signed for Charlton Athletic on a Bosman free transfer and took squad number 35, his then age. His debut for Charlton came on 8 August 2009 in a 3–2 home win against Wycombe Wanderers, a game which saw Dailly score his only Charlton goal. At the end of the 2009–10 season he was named as Charlton Athletic&#x27;s Player of the Year. &quot;I feel very proud&quot;, Dailly told the official website.

===Portsmouth===
Dailly joined Portsmouth on a one-month deal in August 2011. He made his debut on 6 August 2011, in the 2–2 away draw against Middlesbrough, after coming off the bench to replace Hayden Mullins. On 1 September 2011, he was released.

===Southend United===
On 16 March 2012, Dailly signed for League Two side Southend United on non-contract terms, following several months training with the club to recuperate from a knee injury. Dailly made his debut for Southend on 17 March 2012, playing 90 minutes in the 3–2 win at Hereford United. In Dailly&#x27;s third appearance for the club, against Bristol Rovers on 24 March 2012, he broke his toe ruling him out for the remainder of the season. Dailly retired from professional football in July 2012, after 22 years in the game.

==International career==
On 11 September 1990, Dailly became the youngest player to appear for his country at under-21 level when he featured at the age of 16 against Romania at Easter Road. By the time Dailly was too old to continue playing at this level he had received 35 caps, a Scottish record for appearances at under-21 level.

In May 1993, he was included in Andy Roxburgh&#x27;s Scotland squad for the first time for a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification match in Estonia. He earned his first cap four years later when he made his full international debut in May 1997, aged 23, in a 1–0 defeat against Wales. His first goal came in just his second match, and just four days after his international debut, when his early goal helped Scotland to a 3–2 away victory over Malta in a friendly match.

Dailly had a long Scotland career, winning 67 caps and scoring 6 goals. He captained Scotland a total of 12 times and was selected for the Scotland squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Dailly won his last cap as a substitute on Friday 30 May 2008, in a 3–1 friendly defeat against the Czech Republic.

Dailly was famously caught unaware after Germany&#x27;s 2–1 defeat of Scotland on 10 September 2003. He returned to the dressing room after the match shouting, &quot;Cheats! Fucking cheats! Fucking diving cheats!&quot; The outburst was being broadcast live on BBC Scotland as then Scotland manager Berti Vogts was being interviewed by Chick Young. The player would have remained anonymous had it not been for Vogts shouting &quot;Christian!&quot; mid-interview to stop the tirade.

==Personal life==
His sister, Stefani Dailly, is a broadcast journalist who has worked for &quot;STV News&quot;.

His son, Harvey, signed a development contract with Dundee United in August 2015. He made his first team debut in August 2017, but was released in January 2018.

<doc id="1317753" wikidata="Q1106521" url="?curid=1317753" title="Celtic Wicca">
<text>Celtic Wicca is a modern form of Wicca that incorporates some elements of Celtic mythology. It employs the same basic theology, rituals and beliefs as most other forms of Wicca. Celtic Wiccans use the names of Celtic deities, mythological figures, and seasonal festivals within a Wiccan ritual structure and belief system, rather than a traditional or historically Celtic one.

== Origins ==
Wicca, as established by Englishman Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, was not Celtic in nature but contained some influences and borrowings from Celtic sources. &quot;Celtic&quot; Wicca can be seen as emphasizing and elaborating on the facets of Gardnerian Wicca that practitioners believe to be Celtic, while de-emphasizing some of the more obviously non-Celtic facets (such as the worship of deities from other cultures). Author Jane Raeburn believes that while there is &quot;a firm distinction between historical Celtic inspiration and modern Wiccan practice&quot;, that the two can be blended to form &quot;a living path of ethical and spiritual growth&quot;. As Carl McColman has observed, many people find beauty and meaning in this spirituality that blends &quot;religious witchcraft with Celtic wisdom&quot;. 

Several different variations of the tradition have existed. For instance, Lady Sheba (Jessie Bell) called her tradition &quot;American Celtic Wicca&quot;. Gavin Frost and Yvonne Frost of the Church and School of Wicca called their tradition &quot;Celtic Wicca&quot; and followers of this tradition identify as Celtic Wiccans. Additionally, numerous Eclectic Wiccan groups and individuals incorporate what they believe to be Celtic features and self-identify as Celtic Wiccans or Celtic neopagans.

==Comparisons to other traditions==
Celtic Wicca can be seen as both a form of Wicca and a branch of Celtic neopaganism. On the neopagan continuum from eclectic to reconstructionist, Celtic Wicca is at the eclectic end: as non-historical as most forms of Neo-druidism, and contrasting firmly with Celtic reconstructionism, which emphasizes cultural focus and historical accuracy.

==Criticisms==
Celtic Wicca is criticized for a number of reasons. Critics point to the very recent development of the &quot;tradition&quot;, its modernly syncretic nature, its misappropriation or misrepresentation of authentic Celtic traditions and history, and its difference from all historically attested Celtic beliefs and practices. Authors including Ronald Hutton, Aidan Kelly, John Michael Greer and Gordon Cooper have noted that Celtic Wicca draws on mythology by way of the Romanticist Celtic Revival rather than historical fact. Further, these authors have documented that Gardnerian Wicca was synthesized from elements of many cultures and traditions including Hinduism, English folklore, romanticized misinterpretations of what Gardner believed to be Native American beliefs and ceremonies, and the ritual structures and terminology used by the Freemasons. Greer and Cooper specifically point to Gardner&#x27;s involvement in the English Woodcraft and Kibbo Kift groups as a strong influence.

<doc id="1317762" wikidata="Q301053" url="?curid=1317762" title="Pileated gibbon">
<text>The pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus) is a primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae.

The pileated gibbon has sexual dimorphism in fur coloration: males have purely black fur, while females have white-grey colored fur with only the belly and head black. The white and often shaggy hair ring around the head is common to both sexes.

The species has been identified as endangered and is listed in CITES Appendix I. Their main threat is habitat destruction, with the wild forest they live in being converted into farmland. This has led to local extinction in some areas. Also, like many other species of primate, they are hunted and captured for meat and sold into Wildlife smuggling. Many attempts have been made to survey and increase the species&#x27; numbers, both concerning their status in the wild, and in zoos.

==Range==
The range of the pileated gibbon is eastern Thailand, western Cambodia and southwest Laos. Its lifestyle is much like other gibbons: diurnal and arboreal, it lives together in a monogamous pair, brachiates through the trees with its long arms, and predominantly eats fruits, leaves and small animals. Reproduction habits are not well known, but are presumed to be similar to the other gibbons. Mating pairs also mark their own territory together, with the female and male performing loud vocalisations to show this.

The pileated gibbon is found in the following areas. There are about 35,000 individuals in Cambodia and about 30,000 in Thailand.
*Khao Yai National Park, Thailand
*Thap Lan National Park, Thailand
*Khao Ang Ru Nai Sanctuary, Thailand
*Khao Soi Dao Sanctuary, Thailand
*Pang Sida National Park, Thailand
*Ta Phraya National Park, Thailand
*Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia (about 20,000 individuals)
*Bokor National Park, Cambodia (about 1,000 individuals)

==Rescue, rehabilitation and release of the pileated gibbon==
The non-profit organization Wildlife Alliance has cooperated with the Cambodian government to conduct rescue and release programs for the pileated gibbon in Cambodia:
* Rescue - A unique law enforcement team mandated to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade throughout Cambodia, the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team confiscates approximately 5-6,000 live animals annually and has rescued more than 56,000 live animals from its creation in 2001 through 2013. Most of these animals are immediately released into safe habitat, and those who need temporary rehabilitation or permanent care are brought to Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre. Gibbons are threatened by capture for the meat trade and pet trade in addition to threats by habitat loss.
* Rehabilitation - Most of the pileated gibbons at Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre were confiscated from the illegal meat trade or pet trade, rendering them too humanized to be released. However through the center&#x27;s breeding program in which mothers raise their own offspring, gibbons have been successfully prepared for life in the wild.
* Release - In December 2013 a pair of pileated gibbons were successfully released into the protected forests of the Angkor UNESCO World Heritage Site near the ancient temple complexes. This initiative by Wildlife Alliance, the Cambodian Forestry Administration and the Apsara Authority who manages the World Heritage Site is the group&#x27;s first step of many toward repopulating the formerly barren forests surrounding the famous Angkor temples.

<doc id="1317767" wikidata="Q8024358" url="?curid=1317767" title="Window capping">
<text>In construction, capping or window capping (window cladding, window wrapping) refers to the application of aluminum or vinyl sheeting cut and formed with a brake to fit over the exterior, wood trim of a building. The aluminum is intended to make aging trim with peeling paint look better, reduce future paint maintenance, and provide a weather-proof layer to control the of water.

==Overview==
The capping application must direct water away from the original under-lying wood material and prevent infiltration of water into the structure. Cladding applied to exterior window and door casing (brick-moulding) and their associated parts is often referred to as &quot;window capping&quot; or &quot;window cladding&quot;. This sort of capping is typically applied in order to eliminate the need to re-paint wood window trim. The aluminum capping helps to prevent wood rot by protecting the wood from water and snow. However, capping will exacerbate wood rot if the moisture in the wood is coming from inside the building or the capping leaks. Good installation of capping allows for an outlet for water in the event of a leak. Caulking and sealant materials may be used to help prevent leaks but these products are not considered reliable in the long-term.

A sill that has been clad should provide a &quot;drip cap&quot; or &quot;drip-control&quot; function. This will serve to direct water away from the wall surface directly underneath the sill. The leading edge of the sill must be the lowest point on the sill to ensure that water does not wick into the sill material.

Window capping may provide a marginal increase in energy efficiency by decreasing the potential for drafts by providing an extra barrier between the exterior and the interior.

The most common material used in residential window capping is factory painted aluminum. An alternative to factory painted aluminum is to use a vinyl coated aluminium material.

Aluminum capping can be painted so long as the painter is highly skilled and knowledgeable in the field of metal painting.

==Criticisms==
Capping can hide problems rather than fix them. Aluminum and vinyl are impermeable materials so the natural transfer of moisture through the wood trim will be trapped when it reaches the capping material. The quality of paint on some aluminum coil stock begins to chalk or fade in about five years so the claim of being maintenance free can be misleading.

<doc id="1317774" wikidata="Q289945" url="?curid=1317774" title="List of Alaska Routes">
<text>Alaska Routes are both numbered and named. There have been only twelve state highway numbers issued (1 through 11 and 98), and the numbering often has no obvious pattern. For example, Alaska Route 4 (AK-4) runs north and south, whereas AK-2 runs largely east and west, but runs north and south passing through and to the north of Fairbanks. The Klondike Highway, built in 1978, was unnumbered until 1998, when it was given its designation during the centennial of the Klondike Gold Rush. However, many Alaskan highways of greater length than the Klondike Highway remain unnumbered.

Mileposts, frequently used for road markers and official addressing in rural areas, are also more commonly reckoned by landmark names.

Within Alaska, roads are almost invariably referred to by name or general destination, and not by number(s).

Numbered routes often span multiple highway names. For example, AK-1 can refer to any of the Glenn Highway, Seward Highway, Sterling Highway, or Tok Cut-Off; meanwhile, portions of the Seward Highway are numbered AK-1, AK-9 and Interstate A3 (A-3).

==Highways==
===U.S. Highways===

The Alaskan portion of the Alaska Highway was proposed to be designated part of U.S. Highway 97 (US-97), but this was never carried out. Certain prior editions of USGS topographic maps, mostly published during the 1950s, do bear the US-97 highway shield along or near portions of the current AK-2.

==Marine Highway system==
The Alaska Marine Highway and several other Alaska highways or routes are recognized as &quot;highways&quot; eligible for federal funding by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The Marine Highway was declared a National Scenic Byway by the FHWA on June 13, 2002; and later declared an All-American Road on September 22, 2005.

The system is divided into different regions of service: Southeast, Cross-Gulf, Prince William Sound, South-Central, and Southwest.

<text>Rio de Janeiro/Galeão–Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport , popularly known by its original name Galeão International Airport, is the main international airport serving Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

The airport was originally named after the neighborhood of Galeão: &quot;Praia do Galeão&quot; (Galleon Beach) is located in front of the original passenger terminal (the present passenger terminal of the Brazilian Air Force). This beach is the location where the galleon &quot;Padre Eterno&quot; was built in 1663. On January 5, 1999 the name was changed adding a tribute to the Brazilian musician Antonio Carlos Jobim. Galeão Airport is explicitly mentioned in his composition &quot;Samba do Avião&quot;.

Since August 12, 2014 the airport has been operated by the concessionary Rio Galeão, a consortium formed by the Brazilian investor Odebrecht and Changi Airport Group, with a minority participation of the government owned company Infraero, the previous operator. The new concessionary has been using the brand name RIOgaleão–Aeroporto Internacional Tom Jobim.

Some of its facilities are shared with the Galeão Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force.

==History==
On 10 May 1923, a School of Naval Aviation was established near Galeão beach on Governador Island. On 22 May 1941, with the creation of the Brazilian Air Force Ministry, the school became the Galeão Air Force Base; a terminal and hangars were built and the runway extended. Those buildings still exist and Galeão Air Force Base is still active. When Brazil declared war against the Axis on 22 August 1942, the aerodrome began to be used intensely by the Allies for military operations related to World War II.

At the end of the war, Santos Dumont Airport was unable to handle the increased tonnage of aircraft flying on international routes and number of passengers. For this reason, international flights were gradually moved to the site of the Air Force Base. The services were however precarious and a decision was made to build a brand new passenger terminal, opposite to the Air Force Base, across the runway.

On 1 February 1952, the new passenger terminal was opened and remained in use with enlargements until 1977. This terminal is used presently by passenger flights operated by the Brazilian Air Force. The cargo terminal is also located in the area and all-cargo aircraft usually park at its adjoining apron. The whole complex is now informally known as the &quot;old Galeão&quot;.

In the beginning of the 1970s, the airport was Brazil&#x27;s major international and domestic air-hub. Between 1973 and 1987 the airport was managed by ARSA, until ARSA was incorporated by Infraero on 27 February 1987, an agency then recently created by the Brazilian government. Infraero was the administrator until 2013. 

As proof of the airport&#x27;s prestige, the Concorde made its scheduled maiden flight with Air France on 21 January 1976, flying from Paris–Charles de Gaulle to Galeão via Dakar. Those twice-weekly flights were discontinued in 1982. Furthermore, the 007 – James Bond production &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979) shows the Concorde touching down at Galeão.

On 6 June 1967, in response to the growth of air traffic in Brazil, the Brazilian government initiated studies concerning the renovation of airport infrastructure in the country. As part of the conclusions of these studies, because of their location, strategic importance, and security issues, new passenger facilities would be constructed in the Galeão Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro and the São Paulo Air Force Base in São Paulo.

On 20 January 1977, when the airport was receiving most of Brazil&#x27;s major international flights, this new terminal was opened and all scheduled passenger flights were transferred to the new building. This building is known today as Passenger Terminal 1. One of the features dating from this time is the sultry PA system announcements made by Iris Lettieri, which were featured on National Public Radio.

In 1985, the airport lost the title of the country&#x27;s major international airport to the newly-opened São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport. At that time, a new runway allowing intercontinental flights with no weight restrictions was opened in São Paulo and Brazilian and foreign airlines increasingly used São Paulo as a national and international hub. As a consequence, the number of transiting passengers dropped. Constant efforts were made by the government of the state of Rio de Janeiro to reverse the trend. As a result, after stagnating for years embittered by the loss of domestic flights to Santos Dumont Airport and international flights to São Paulo–Guarulhos Airport, Galeão has – since late 2004 – gradually recovered its importance in the national and international spheres with addition of flights and airlines.

During the year 1991, Passenger Terminal 1 underwent its first major renovation in preparation for the United Nations Earth Summit held in 1992. Its annual capacity was increased to 7.5 million passengers a year. On 20 July 1999, Passenger Terminal 2 was opened. The airport has those two passenger terminals in elliptical format, each with twelve jetways and capable of handling 7.5 million passengers annually.

On 31 August 2009, Infraero unveiled a 819 million (431 million; 302 million) investment plan to upgrade Galeão International Airport focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup which was held in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro being one of the venue cities, and the 2016 Summer Olympics, which Rio de Janeiro would host. The investment was supposed to be distributed as follows:
*Renovation of Passenger Terminal 1. Completed: 2012
*Completion and renovation of Passenger Terminal 2. Completed: June 2012
*Construction of further parking. Value 220.0 million. Completed: Late-2013

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Galeão was considered to be in good situation, operating with less than 70% of its capacity.

Like most South American airports operated by government-owned operators, Galeão had high operating costs per passenger. On 26 April 2011, it was confirmed that in order to speed-up much needed renovation and upgrade works, private companies would be granted a concession to operate some Infraero airports among them, on a second phase, Galeão. The plan was confirmed on 31 May 2011, and it was added that Infraero would retain 49% of the shares of each privatized airport. On 22 November 2013, the Brazilian Government had a bidding process to determine the airport&#x27;s private operator from 2014 until 2039. The Group Aeroporto Rio de Janeiro, also known as RIOgaleão, formed by Grupo Odebrecht (60%) and Singaporean operator Changi Airport Group (40%) paid 19 billion and won the competition. The contract was signed on 2 April 2014.

The new concessionary, RIOgaleão, has revised, modified and upgraded those plans to include the construction of a new pier with 26 new bridges, a new apron for 97 aircraft, and 2,640 car-parking spaces have been added in 2016–17, which would sum up to 2 billion reais.

One day after the closure of the 2016 Summer Olympics, Galeão handled an all-time record of passengers on a single day. It is estimated that on 22 August 2016, 85,000 passengers transited at the airport facilities.

On 10 February 2022, the concessionary requested the devolution of the facility. The request was approved by the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil on 25 May 2022. A new bidding process is expected to take place in 2023.

On 27 May 2022, TAP Maintenance &amp; Engineering closed the facility at Galeão which it had operated since 2006. This maintenance center was previously owned by Varig. On 7 July 2022, United Airlines was announced as the new owner of the facility.

In April 2022, the airport was used for Stock Car Pro Series automobile racing. Cacá Bueno Circuit, named after Cacá Bueno, Rio de Janeiro-born and 5 times Stock Car Brasil champion, was built within the airport partially using runways 10/28 for this purpose. However, the circuit was not included in the 2023 Stock Car Pro Series calendar due to the increase of flights after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Galeão was the primary airport of Rio de Janeiro, being the much smaller Santos Dumont Airport the secondary facility until 2019. In 2020 positions inverted and in 2022 Santos Dumont was accounting for approximately 63% of the total traffic of Greater Rio de Janeiro, spread into three airports. In 2022 Santos Dumont reached 10,178,502 transported passengers whereas Galeão had only 5,895,257. In order to control and revert this abnormal trend, on August 10, 2023 the Civil Aviation National Council issued an order to restrict Santos Dumont services to airports located within 400 km maximum from Rio de Janeiro and without international services. The resolution came into force on January 1, 2024, and is considered to be provisory, until a balance is reached. Airlines started cancelling and/or moving services to Galeão in September 2023. Following resistance from the international aviation community, on November 8, 2023 the restrictions were reversed and replaced by an annual cap of 6.5 million passengers transiting at Santos Dumont Airport, starting in 2024.

The facility covers a total of 1,788.2 hectares (4,419 acres), being the largest airport site in terms of area in Brazil.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
Since November 2016, the check-in and baggage claim areas of Terminal 1 are not in use. All passengers must use Terminal 2 to access the boarding gates of any terminal.

==Statistics==

Following is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2013) and RIOgaleão (2014-2023) reports:

==Accidents and incidents==
*27 July 1952: a Pan Am Boeing 377 Stratocruiser 10–26 registration N1030V operating flight 201 en route from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão to Buenos Aires–Ezeiza following pressurization problems during climb, a door blew open, a passenger was blown out and the cabin considerably damaged. One passenger died.
*11 January 1959: a Lufthansa Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation registration D-ALAK operating Flight 502 flying from Hamburg to Rio de Janeiro–Galeão via Frankfurt, Paris–Orly and Dakar crashed during approach under heavy rain at Galeão. The crew descended below minimums. Of the 39 passengers and crew aboard, 3 survived. This was the first accident of Lufthansa after it was re-established.
*22 December 1959: a VASP Vickers Viscount 827 registration PP-SRG while on approach to land at Rio de Janeiro–Galeão was involved in a mid-air collision with the Brazilian Air Force Fokker S-11 (T-21) registration FAB0742 in the vicinity of Manguinhos Airport. All 32 people on board the Viscount were killed, as were a further ten on the ground. The T-21 pilot parachuted to safety. This accident eventually led to the closure of Manguinhos Airport.
*20 August 1962: a Panair do Brasil Douglas DC-8-33 registration PP-PDT taking-off from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão to Lisbon overran the runway into the ocean during an aborted operation. Of the 120 passengers and crew aboard 14 died.
*1 January 1970: a Cruzeiro do Sul Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle VI R en route from Montevideo to Rio de Janeiro–Galeão with 33 occupants aboard was hijacked by 6 people who demanded to be flown to Cuba. The flight was diverted to Lima, Panama City and arrived in Havana two days later. There were no victims.
*1 July 1970: a Cruzeiro do Sul Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle VI R registration PP-PDX en route from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão to São Paulo with 31 occupants aboard was hijacked by 4 persons who demanded the release of political prisoners that were to be taken to Cuba. The aircraft was stormed and the hijackers arrested. There were no victims and the hijacking lasted less than a day.
*9 June 1973: a Varig cargo Boeing 707-327C registration PP-VJL flying from Campinas to Rio de Janeiro–Galeão while making an instrument approach to Rio de Janeiro–Galeão had technical problems with the spoilers which eventually caused the aircraft to pitch down, descended fast, struck approach lights and ditch. All 6 occupants died.
*26 July 1979: a Lufthansa cargo Boeing 707-330C registration D-ABUY operating flight 527 from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão to Frankfurt via Dakar collided with a mountain 5 minutes after take-off from Galeão. The crew of 3 died.
*12 December 1985: an Air France Boeing 747-228B, registration F-GCBC, arriving from Paris–Charles de Gaulle with 273 passengers and crew, veered off the right side of runway 15 on landing, crossed a ditch and collided with a concrete wall in the cargo apron. There was a fire that totally destroyed the aircraft, but all occupants had been safely evacuated before that, with no victims or serious injuries. The accident was later traced to a ruptured power control cable in engine #1, which made the engine accelerate beyond maximum takeoff power, destabilizing the plane.
*11 February 2025: A GOL Transportes Aereos Boeing 737-8 MAX, registration PS-GPP was accelerating down runway 10 when it collided with an airport vehicle. The takeoff was rejected and all passengers disembarked. While the aircraft and the car both sustained damage, there were no injuries.

==Access==
The airport is located north of downtown Rio de Janeiro.

There are executive (blue) and ordinary (yellow) taxis available and bookable on company booths at arrival halls of both terminals.

TransCarioca line of the BRT integrated public transportation system links Terminals 1 and 2 with Terminal Alvorada in Barra da Tijuca with an intermediate stop at the Line 2 subway Vicente de Carvalho station, where one can access the entire subway system. At Alvorada one can transfer between the TransCarioca and TransOeste lines. The system operates 24 hours a day and tickets are sold in the BRT booths on the arrivals level. 

BRT integrated public transportation operates an express line to Gentileza Intermodal Terminal (TIG), adjacent to Novo Rio Bus Terminal. At TIG, several urban bus lines and Rio de Janeiro Light Rail system are easily accessible. The latter has connections to the Railway and Ferry stations and Santos Dumont Airport. 

Viação 1001 operates the urban bus line 761-D from the airport to Niterói. Furthermore, the same company operates an executive service to Armação dos Búzios four times a day. Departure is from the arrivals level of Terminal 1.

Ordinary city busses 924 and 925 operate to the neighborhood of Ilha do Governador, and 915 to Bonsucesso. From both neighborhoods there are connections to the North and South Sides of the city.

<text>Robert Sime &quot;Roy&quot; Aitken (born 24 November 1958) is a Scottish former football player and manager. He made over 480 league appearances for Celtic, and later played for Newcastle United, St Mirren and Aberdeen. Aitken also made 57 international appearances for Scotland. His playing position was either in midfield or defence.

Aitken had become assistant manager at Aberdeen towards the end of his playing career, and was appointed their manager in February 1995. He led the &quot;Dons&quot; to a Scottish League Cup win in 1995–96, but was sacked in November 1997. He has since coached several clubs, including Leeds United and Aston Villa.

==Playing career==
Born in Irvine, Ayrshire, Aitken grew up in Ardrossan. He signed for Celtic as a youngster at 16 and came through their youth ranks. Aitken was nicknamed &quot;The Bear&quot; by their supporters due to his large frame and commanding presence. Aitken broke into the Celtic first team as a teenager, first captaining the team in October 1977. Playing as a centre back or defensive midfielder, Aitken made the third-most appearances in the club&#x27;s history and was particularly noted for his contributions in the club&#x27;s double-winning 1987–88 season.

Aitken later went on to play for Newcastle United, joining the club for £500,000 in January 1990. He captained the side in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to gain promotion from the Second Division. Having been signed by Jim Smith, he was deemed surplus to requirements when Smith was replaced as manager by Ossie Ardiles and returned to Scotland with St Mirren. He did not remain long at St Mirren, signing for Aberdeen for £100,000 to act as player-assistant manager to Willie Miller.

Aitken won 57 caps for the Scotland national football team, scoring once. He featured at both the 1986 and 1990 World Cups, captaining Scotland at the latter tournament and in 27 of his international appearances.

==Management and coaching career==

Aitken was appointed manager of Aberdeen in February 1995 after the sacking of Willie Miller. At the time, Aberdeen were struggling to avoid relegation, and Aitken made a bright start by winning 2–0 against Rangers in his first game as manager, but then lost to part-time Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Cup by the same scoreline. Aberdeen finished second bottom of the league, but maintained their top league status by defeating Dunfermline Athletic in a two-legged play-off.

The following season saw Aitken invest heavily in the transfer market; signing striker Dean Windass for £750,000 and midfielder Paul Bernard for a club record £1 million. Bernard struggled to justify his expensive transfer fee whilst Windass&#x27; time at Pittodrie was hampered by his on-field indiscipline. Nevertheless, Aitken led Aberdeen to silverware when they won the Scottish League Cup on 26 November 1995, beating Dundee 2–0 in the final.

On being sacked by Aberdeen in November 1997 (after a 5–0 loss to Dundee United), Aitken turned his attention to coaching. In February 1998 he was appointed head coach of the Maldives national football team but resigned a month later over the poor facilities available to the team. After obtaining his UEFA Pro Licence at the Scottish Football Association&#x27;s Largs training centre, Aitken went on to become a coach with Leeds United before rejoining former Leeds coach David O&#x27;Leary at Aston Villa.

On 20 July 2006, he was named caretaker manager of Aston Villa after O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s departure the previous evening. Aitken managed Villa to three pre-season victories before being replaced by Martin O&#x27;Neill.

In January 2007, he was appointed as one of Alex McLeish&#x27;s assistants with the Scotland national football team. On 28 November 2007, he followed McLeish, newly appointed as manager of Birmingham City, to the club as first-team coach alongside Andy Watson.

In July 2010, Aitken left Birmingham City to join David O&#x27;Leary in Dubai with Al-Ahli. Afterwards taking up the role as Director of Football at Al-Ahli.

<doc id="1317779" wikidata="Q4933482" url="?curid=1317779" title="Bob Murray (businessman)">
<text>Sir Robert Sydney Murray (born 3 August 1946) is a businessman and former chairman of Sunderland AFC. An accountant by trade, he made his fortune through the growth and sale of the Spring Ram kitchen manufacturing company.

==Sunderland AFC==
Murray was born in Consett, County Durham. He became chairman of Sunderland AFC in 1986, replacing the motor magnate Sir Tom Cowie.

Murray&#x27;s first season as chairman ended with the dismissal of manager Lawrie McMenemy and the club&#x27;s relegation to the Third Division for the first time in their history. A revival saw Sunderland reach the First Division in 1990, only to be relegated after one season. They did not return to the top division until 1996, though they did reach the FA Cup final in 1992 and lost 2-0 to Liverpool.

By 1991, Murray was investigating the possibility of building a new stadium for Sunderland to replace the aging Roker Park; after plans to build a stadium near the Nissan car factory failed, he turned his attention to the former Monkwearmouth colliery site on the banks of the River Wear, which became available with the colliery&#x27;s closure in December 1993. His funds went towards the new Stadium of Light, which opened on the Monkwearmouth colliery site in July 1997 with an all-seater capacity of more than 42,000 (which within a few years was increased to more than 48,000).

In seasons 1999/2000 and 2000/01 Sunderland finished seventh in the Premiership but Murray became unpopular when Sunderland were relegated in 2003 with a then record low of 19 points as well as debts of nearly £30 million. Promotion was gained two years later but Murray was criticised again as Sunderland endured a poor season back in the Premiership.

Sunderland had progressed well during the final 11 seasons of Murray&#x27;s ownership. They never finished below third place in the league&#x27;s second tier; whereas the club had finished below this position 7 times in Murray&#x27;s first 9 seasons as chairman.

==Club takeover==
Murray had stated that he was willing to sell his shares in the club if an investor demonstrated a willingness to invest considerable money in the club - not simply purchase his shares. In 2006 former player Niall Quinn made an offer for the club, backed by a consortium of Irish businessmen. In order to for this to proceed Murray resigned as chairman, enabling the Drumaville Consortium takeover to occur, although he remained on the board in the interim.

At a press conference on 28 June 2006 he confirmed that the club would be sold to Quinn&#x27;s consortium for £10 million. Murray received £5.7 million of the total, although he has stated that the extensive negotiations were in order to ensure the bid was in the interests of the club and not, as speculated by the press, for his own financial gain. This assertion was supported by the relatively low price at which he allowed his controlling stake to be bought. On 3 July 2006, the Drumaville Consortium bid was officially confirmed and the offer of £10 million accepted, with Quinn having the unusual dual role of club Chairman and Acting Manager. Murray was appointed as the club&#x27;s Life President by the new owners.

Murray was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2003 New Year Honours, &quot;for services to Sunderland Football Club and to the community&quot;; he was knighted in the 2010 Birthday Honours &quot;for services to Football and to Education in the North East.&quot;

==Leeds Beckett University==
In October 2012, Murray was announced as the new chancellor of Leeds Beckett University.

<text>Ultimate Iron Man is the name of two comic book miniseries written by Orson Scott Card and published by Marvel Comics. The stories tell the origins of the Ultimate Marvel version of Iron Man, who appears in &quot;The Ultimates&quot;.

==Publication history==
The first volume, published between 2005 and 2006, was a five-part miniseries depicting the early life and origins of Tony Stark, and was drawn by Andy Kubert.

The second volume is also a five-part miniseries and had its first issue released on December 12, 2007. This volume follows directly on from the first series and depicts the early uses of the Iron Man armour, art by Pasqual Ferry and Dave McCaig.

Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates&quot; retconned the series so it was actually the origin for an anime cartoon in the Ultimate Universe due to the miniseries&#x27; poor reception.

== Volume one ==
&quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot; #1 reveals that Tony Stark&#x27;s genius is the result of an accident his mother (brilliant scientist Maria Cerrera, who is the second wife of Tony Stark&#x27;s father, Howard, and works for him in research and development before Tony was born) suffered while she was carrying him in her womb. The accident changed the genetic structure of both her and her unborn child, but culminated in her death during childbirth. The child, named Antonio (Tony for short), developed neural tissue normally found only in the brain all throughout his body, causing his entire body to act as one massive brain, giving him tremendous mental capacity. However, one of the side effects of the accident from the minute he was born was an extreme dermal sensitivity, making even the sensation of air on his skin feel like severe burns due to the overstimulation of neural cells in his skin. Howard Stark, a master inventor and owner and CEO of his own billion dollar tech company, used a newly invented liquid, biological armor to ease Tony&#x27;s agony; a buffer allowing him to interact with the world normally, but one he would have to wear for the rest of his life.

Despite the pain, he is endowed with regenerative capabilities due to the same mutation that caused the neural cells to differentiate all over his body, allowing him to completely regenerate whole body parts if necessary. The biotechnology armor he wears is constructed out of genetically modified bacteria that are able to group together to dissipate kinetic energy when impacted upon, allowing the wearer to withstand tremendous blows and is able to dissolve any metal that can be oxidized. The two disadvantages of this biotech armor, which made it unmarketable, are that it can be easily neutralized by being washed off with antibacterial soap and water and, more importantly, that it will dissolve a normal human&#x27;s skin after a few hours if not thoroughly washed off. This &quot;side effect&quot; worked well with Tony&#x27;s regenerative capabilities, seeing as how his skin would regenerate as fast as the armor would eat it, making it a perfect fit. Another secondary problem was that, initially, the liquid armor turned his skin a bright blue hue, making socialization and the idea of going to a normal school more difficult.

In &quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot; #2, young Tony Stark is shown covered in the blue skin-armor developed by his father in issue #1. Attempting to learn how to manufacture the bio-armor, Zebediah Stane (not knowing that the armor did not work correctly for normal humans), kidnaps and tortures Tony by washing off the armor with antibacterial soap causing Tony to scream in agony when his unprotected skin hit the air.

In issue #3, Howard arrives with a SWAT team and arrests Zebediah. During the skirmish, the toes on one of Tony&#x27;s feet are severed (which, after a time, grow back due to Tony&#x27;s regenerative capabilities, highlighting the extent of this ability). After the incident, a transparent version of the armor is developed, and, no longer blue, Tony begins attending a prep school. The story then fast forwards to an older Stark. His father has lost ownership of his corporation to Zebediah&#x27;s now-wife Loni (who was Stark&#x27;s first wife, before Maria) and they now live a middle class existence in a normal home. Tony is trying to follow in Howard&#x27;s footsteps as an inventor and is developing a prototype power-armor. Not the most popular student at his school, he is constantly picked on and bullied. Seeing that he, also, is the victim of his classmates, Tony eventually befriends fellow student James Rhodes.

&quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot; #4 follows Tony Stark, shortly after befriending Rhodes, getting in a scuffle with bullies where they try to force Tony, feet first, into a lit furnace (having been lied to earlier that Tony would not be harmed by this action) that burns and destroys the lower half of his body and nearly leaves him dead. The altercation is interrupted by Tony&#x27;s friends, causing the bullies to run away. Normally an injury like that would kill a human, but his friends watch, stunned, as Tony&#x27;s body begins to regrow itself (and eventually regrows completely back to normal as if it never happened). Discovering that the bullies were following orders from an unknown individual, Stark&#x27;s father decides, for their own protection and to put their skills to better use, to enroll Stark, Rhodes, and Nifara (another of Tony&#x27;s friends), who witnessed the attack and were all of genius-level intelligence, into the Baxter Building program, a school for above genius intelligence. Also enrolled in the school is Obadiah Stane, the son of Zebediah. Shortly after their arrival, Stark witnesses Obadiah murder a pair of students and then make it look like an accident, but is unable to prove it. This incident hardens Stark&#x27;s resolve to improve his armor and punish Obadiah. At this point, he has already begun to build a suit that closely resembles a traditional Iron Man suit, with Rhodes and Nifara helping him develop it.

&quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot; #5 shows that shortly after Howard&#x27;s arrest based on planted evidence (by Obadiah) at the gruesome murder of his enemy Zebediah Stane, Tony gets his first taste of champagne at a party held by his father. Tony was warned against alcohol by his father because it would affect his brain more than a normal human due to his decentralized brain tissue and increase his chances of alcoholism. He later says that while he was intoxicated, it was the first time in his life he was not in chronic pain. After Howard&#x27;s incarceration, Tony takes control of his father&#x27;s company. It&#x27;s at this point where two prototype variations of the suit are shown. One is roughly tall, designed for more practical testings, while the second is a large suit at least tall, for designing any additions to the traditional suit before including them to the more restricted design. The suit doesn&#x27;t fly, but hovers or bounces and is not completely stable. Stark is forced to use the prototype to foil a terrorist plot to destroy his building. Though Tony is successful, the terrorists manage to detonate the bomb prematurely and completely destroy the suit. Tony is also injured, but due to his physiology, bounces back quickly.

== Volume two ==
Despite surviving being blown up in his prototype armor, Tony has other problems to address. Howard is still wrongly imprisoned for the murder of rival Zebediah Stane, and teenage Tony is forced to run Stark Enterprises in his stead. After seeing the prototype armor in use, the military wish to use the armor themselves. Convincing the military that the armors are in fact robots, both Tony and Jim Rhodes (Ultimate War Machine) suit up and go on the mission masquerading as robots. They complete the mission, and find a map that leads them to believe there are nukes in New York. Tony begins trying to find a way to release his father from jail and find out who the terrorists were that tried to blow up his building.

Obadiah is working with a man named Dolores, who is responsible for the terrorist attack on the Stark building. Dolores convinces him to try to murder Howard. Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a &quot;hypnotizing&quot; bio-drug, and the guard tries to kill Howard. He fails, though Howard gets shot in the process and is in ICU. Tony sends one of his &quot;robots&quot; to protect his father in the hospital.

Tony goes to Obadiah&#x27;s house in the Iron Man armor and confronts him on setting up his father and sending him to prison. Obadiah says it was all Dolores&#x27; idea, and sets up a meeting with Dolores and Tony. Obadiah also figures out that the armor is not a robot, and that Tony is actually inside, a fact he shares with Dolores before he meets with Tony.

Dolores and Tony make a deal. Dolores will give Tony the information about the terrorists with nukes who plan to bomb the city, and Tony will give Dolores one of his &quot;robots&quot;. Tony, knowing that Dolores knows he wears the armor personally decides to trick him and actually bring an Iron Man suit that is remote controlled. Dolores and Tony meet on a place together, holding each other hostage while their friends confirm each others&#x27;s end of the bargain. Dolores is skeptical because the robot isn&#x27;t walking smoothly and is clumsy, and Tony is skeptical because the feds found a nuke but no terrorists with it, and the deal was for both the nuke &quot;and&quot; the terrorists. Dolores&#x27;s men plan to kill the feds who delivered them the robot, but Ultimate War Machine shows up to save them.

Tony then realizes that Dolores is no longer on the plane, and upon breaking into the cockpit he sees another nuke. He can&#x27;t disable it, because then a separate bomb will go off, destroying the nuke and plane. War Machine goes to Dolores&#x27; mansion, only to find him dead. Someone booby trapped his piano, and it blew up in his face while he was playing. Tony flies the plane low enough to the water for Obadiah to jump off. He then gets his nanobots to disarm the nuke and set off the smaller bomb while he attempts to jump off the plane. They realize that another arms dealer was out to kill everyone (Dolores, Obadiah, and Tony).

Meanwhile, Howard is recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. He fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him, and says that he thinks Loni, Howard&#x27;s first wife and Obadiah&#x27;s mother, is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them. Tony, Howard, War Machine, and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes, injuring War Machine. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Iron Man catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Iron Man flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni, and their hideout. Iron Man breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Iron Man saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After killing Nifara and the guards, (she wants no witnesses) Loni confesses that all she has ever wanted from life was power, and her only interest in men has been finding one who would help her acquire it. Howard, she laments, was smart enough to be able to conquer the world, but lacked the ambition to do so; Zebediah, her second husband, was the other way around (ambitious, but stupid); Obadiah, on the other hand, is both smart and ambitious, but unfortunately his loyalty to her can no longer be relied on.

Iron Man shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn&#x27;t take the suit off. Tony takes off his armor, and Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing of his body&#x27;s self-healing capabilities. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to his father. Unnoticed by anyone else, Loni reaches for a gun, but Obadiah appears, angry that his mother almost killed him with the poison gas, and kills her. However, he decides not to attack Tony, conceding that Tony had saved his life several times, but declares that they are now &quot;even.&quot; Howard, Tony, and Obadiah are all picked up by federal authorities and returned home. Obadiah muses that, with his mother dead, he is finally &quot;free.&quot;

<doc id="1317798" wikidata="Q7722025" url="?curid=1317798" title="The Chamber (game show)">
<text>The Chamber is an American game show that aired on Fox in January 2002. The show featured contestants answering questions while strapped into a torture chamber, in which they were exposed to either very hot or very cold temperatures alongside other environmental extremes, such as high winds or simulated earthquakes. Sportscaster Rick Schwartz hosted the show. After only three of its six taped episodes were aired, the series was cancelled due to declining ratings and controversy over the show&#x27;s content.

==Gameplay==
===Pre-game faceoff===
To begin, two contestants (always one male and one female) were given a category by host Rick Schwartz. The contestants went back and forth, providing a single answer that fit the category, until one person either gave an incorrect answer, duplicated an answer, or took too much time. At that moment, the opponent could score a point by giving one more right answer. The first to score two points in this way moved on to the main game.

===Main game===
Before entering the Chamber, the contestant was offered a $500 buyout to leave the game. To begin, the contestant was strapped into a chair, arms raised over the head. During the pre-game setup, a computer would choose whether the contestant would play against the &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; chamber.

===Rules===
Each player&#x27;s goal was to answer as many questions, and to last in the chamber as long as possible. The player would be said to have won if they remained in the chamber, correctly answering questions through all seven rounds. Otherwise, the game could end in any of the following ways:
* Answering two consecutive questions incorrectly.
* The player&#x27;s &quot;stress quotient&quot; exceeding a predetermined &quot;Danger Zone&quot; threshold for 20 seconds. Viewers only knew that it was an equation that used blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature as variables. However, unlike ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Chair&quot;, players were not penalized monetarily for exceeding their Danger Zone.
* The show&#x27;s medical staff could stop the game if they felt that the player would not be able to continue, or had been rendered unconscious from the stress. Neither of these happened, though one contestant, Jennifer Basa, nearly reached that point, and had to receive clearance from the show&#x27;s medical staff in order to continue.
* The player could voluntarily end the game by saying, &quot;Stop the chamber!&quot;

As each round began, one minute was put on the clock and questions were asked to the player, each worth $1,000 if answered correctly. If the game ended for any of the aforementioned reasons above, the money was cut in half. If the player beat the level, the game would go into stop down mode for ten seconds, allowing Schwartz to check the contestant&#x27;s status, after which the conditions inside would intensify. The maximum amount of questions was not stated, but with six questions per level and seven levels, the potential top prize would be $126,000.

====Conditions====
If the winner could also manage to answer 25 questions or more correctly, the total winnings would be tripled. Additionally, that environment would be retired, and something new created. It was reported that plans for future chambers centered around themes such as water, electric (shock) or insects; Bill Carter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the latter may have involved &quot;500 flies&quot; released into the chamber. Only two variants of the chamber were depicted on the episodes that aired: a &quot;hot&quot; chamber and a &quot;cold&quot; chamber. 

===Show format===
For the first two aired episodes, there were three games played per hour. For the final episode, a fourth game was added to fill out the time. A male voice (Tony Rodgers) asked the questions, and a female voice (Karly Rothenberg) would let contestants and viewers know when the Chamber was transitioning into higher levels and shutting down. However, on the last-aired episode, Schwartz asked the questions as well as conducting interviews during the down time.

==Production==
The series was developed by Mike Darnell, then head of alternative programming at Fox, in conjunction with Dick Clark Productions. Darnell claimed he was inspired by &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, which had debuted on NBC in 2001, and wanted &quot;The Chamber&quot; to emphasize the &quot;visceral&quot; effects the game had on the contestants, telling Bill Carter of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I want to hear if they are in pain or suffering&quot;. Preston Beckman, a fellow Fox executive, believed Darnell conceived and produced the show with the intent of leading viewers to wonder if &quot;Fox might actually kill someone on television&quot;.

The producers of the ABC game show &quot;The Chair&quot;, which also premiered in early 2002 and had previously been pitched to Darnell at Fox, sued over alleged similarities between the two programs, including contestants answering trivia questions in a high-stress environment with their vital signs monitored throughout. Fox countersued, claiming that the ABC program had sent producers to &quot;spy on the set&quot; of &quot;The Chamber&quot;. In a 2007 book, Carter reports that Darnell did in fact conceive the show as a response to &quot;The Chair&quot;, and that &quot;The Chamber&quot; was rushed into production in November 2001 after ABC beat out Fox for the rights to the other show.

&quot;The Chamber&quot; began taping at Hollywood Center Studios in late December 2001. Sportscaster Matt Vasgersian was initially chosen to host, but objected to the show&#x27;s content and quit, walking off set &quot;in disgust&quot; during a rehearsal. He was replaced by Rick Schwartz, a sports radio host in Los Angeles. During production, a technical malfunction briefly left a contestant trapped inside the hot chamber, with crew members unable to release them from the set or turn off the heating effects for &quot;some moments,&quot; though they were freed without injury. Gail Berman, then the president of Fox, was on set at the time and greatly disturbed by the incident.

Being produced in parallel with &quot;The Chair&quot;, ABC and Fox competed to get their respective shows on the air first, with &quot;The Chamber&quot; ultimately premiering on Sunday, January 13, 2002, two days before &quot;The Chair&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Chamber&quot; received negative reviews, with Carter reporting that the show caused &quot;a critical outcry over subjecting people to what appeared to be torture for the entertainment of television viewers&quot;. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;″s Kevin Cowherd called the show &quot;a sordid, putrid mess&quot;. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Phil Gallo described it as &quot;a prototype for the joy-free gameshow&quot;.

The series premiered to around ten million viewers in the United States, performing best among younger audiences, but viewership had declined to 5.6 million by the third episode, when it had been moved to Friday nights. It was cancelled after Fox executives concluded that the controversy around the show, coupled with low viewership, left no reason for its continuation.

The organization&#x27;s mascot is McGruff the Crime Dog, a talking bloodhound dog character created to educate children about crime prevention. Paul DelPonte, a one-time federal whistleblower, was appointed to head the organization in 2021.

==History==
Carl M. Loeb, Jr. (son of banker John Langeloth Loeb Sr.), was a former vice chairman of the board of directors of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. Loeb left that group in order to found the National Crime Prevention Council in 1982, where he served as its chairman. The organization is attempting to introduce the mascot to the next generation of young people. A core of the effort aims to link crime prevention with health.

== Campaigns ==

Working with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the Council ran a national campaign in 2022 to warn consumers on the hazard of purchasing counterfeit goods. The campaign features new ads with McGruff in 3D animation, as well as a race car driven by NASCAR&#x27;s Joey Gase.

In December 2021, McGruff and a public service announcement on kidnapping were featured in the animated television series the &quot;Family Guy&quot;. In July 2022, McGruff made his first full-length movie debut in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: The Rescue Rangers.&quot; 

In October 2022 the organization launched the Lives Project, to call attention to the growing fentanyl crisis. In December of the same year, the organization wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for an investigation into sale of fake drugs containing fentanyl. The following month an investigation was opened.

<doc id="1317824" wikidata="Q4833663" url="?curid=1317824" title="Iḷisaġvik College">
<text>Iḷisaġvik College () is a public tribal land-grant community college in Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska. Operated by the North Slope Borough, a home rule government of the Iñupiat, it is the only tribally controlled college in Alaska, and it is the northernmost accredited community college in the United States. The college is located within the boundaries of the North Slope. It is an region of Arctic tundra. It is connected to the Dalton Highway only during the winter, by an ice road for local residents. The community can also be reached by plane.

The college is a member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, and it offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration, associate&#x27;s degrees, one-year certificates, and adult education courses for GED preparation. In 2020, the school&#x27;s Alaska Dental Therapy Educational Program became the first program in the United States to be fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation.

==History==

Iḷisaġvik College (IC) was renamed in 2005. It had been developed in alliance with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, beginning in 1986. Like other tribal colleges, it is a result of the Native American and Alaskan Native self-determination movement that expanded in late 1960s and early 1970s. The North Slope Borough was organized as a home rule government in 1972, and with that, the Iñupiat people took other steps toward regaining control of their culture.

The college was created to satisfy higher education needs of Alaskan Natives and American Indians. IC generally serves geographically isolated populations that have no other means accessing higher education. Beginning in 1986, the North Slope Borough had worked with the University of Alaska Fairbanks to create the North Slope Higher Education Center.

In 1995 the Borough passed an ordinance incorporating Iḷisaġvik College as a public and independent non-profit corporation. The school moved to the facility previously used by the United States Naval Arctic Research Laboratory (NARL). In 1996, IC took over the Iñupiat Heritage Center. In 1997 the school changed its name to Arctic Sivunmun Iḷisaġvik College. It was led from 1995 to 2005 by college president, Edna Ahgeak MacLean (Iñupiat) an educator from Utqiaġvik (Barrow). Iḷisaġvik College was a leader in 1997 in founding the Consortium for Alaska Native Higher Education (CANHE).

In 2005, the North Slope Borough established IC, the first, and still the only, Tribal College in the state of Alaska. It was federally recognized in 2007 as the 36th tribal college in the United States and designated as a land-grant college the following year.

===Presidents===
IC has been led primarily by indigenous educators, who have mostly been local Iñupiat people. Brooke Gondara is Northern Cheyenne, and Justina Wilhelm.

==Academics==
Accredited in 2003 by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, the college offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration, associate&#x27;s degrees, one-year certificates, and adult education courses for GED preparation. Academic programs at IC reflect local Iñupiat traditions, values, and culture. They are also intended to provide training for career and employment opportunities.

In 2018, then-President Brower discussed the hope of expanding a current program into the school&#x27;s second bachelor&#x27;s degree program in elementary education with an indigenous focus. In 2020, the college&#x27;s Alaska Dental Therapy Educational Program became the first program in the United States to be fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation. The program opened in 2004 and, by 2017, had increased oral healthcare services via Tribal Health Services by 40,000 people, mainly in rural populations across the state.

===Partnerships===
IC is a member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), a community of tribally and federally chartered institutions that work to strengthen and lead tribal communities in higher education.

==Governance==
Iḷisaġvik College is sanctioned by the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope (ICAS) tribal government. Iḷisaġvik College weaves Iñupiaq values into all its activities because it believes these values make its students and educational community stronger, more cohesive and more successful. Being true to the core values of the culture it predominantly serves helps to make Iḷisaġvik a valued and contributing member of that culture. By helping to strengthen the language and traditions of the Iñupiat, Iḷisaġvik fulfills its role as a distinctly indigenous institution that aims to enhance the local culture, while helping its students gain a foothold in the economy of the 21st century. Iḷisaġvik&#x27;s goal is to create successful graduates who can incorporate their traditional values into modern life and, in doing so, enhances both.

==Campus==
The Tuzzy Consortium Library is named after Evelyn Tuzroyluk Higbee, a member of the original Board of Higher Education for the college.

The campus is located in the former complex of the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory.

<doc id="1317836" wikidata="Q2892164" url="?curid=1317836" title="Bay Lake (Florida lake)">
<text>Bay Lake is a natural lake about across and with a depth of , located in Orange County, Florida, United States, in the north end of the Walt Disney World property, in the Disney-controlled city of Bay Lake, Florida, and immediately to the east of the Magic Kingdom.

It is roughly triangular in shape and is under the jurisdiction of the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The lake connects with the Disney-made Seven Seas Lagoon via a water bridge on the west side.

== Bordering resorts and points of interest ==
Bay Lake is bordered by three resorts, Disney&#x27;s Wilderness Lodge, Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort, and Disney&#x27;s Fort Wilderness Resort &amp; Campground; along with Bay Lake Tower and Wilderness Lodge Villas, both owned by Disney Vacation Club. All three resorts have a marina which offers boat rentals to guests. Transportation boats run regularly between all the resorts as well.

On the southwest side of the lake, the remnants of Disney&#x27;s River Country, Disney&#x27;s first water park, can be found. In the far north corner of the lake is a dry dock service area where the transportation boats are stored at night. To the east of the dry dock there are several recreational boat docks which are used by the residents of the city of Bay Lake.

== Islands ==
There are two islands located in Bay Lake. The largest is Discovery Island located in the center of the lake and directly across from Disney&#x27;s River Country. Discovery Island operated as a walk-through wildlife sanctuary from 1974 until 1999. It was closed due to its similarity in theme to the newly opened Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom. The original dock, as well as some attractions, can still be seen on the shorelines.

As of 05/18/23, Discovery Island&#x27;s shorelines have been covered in wildlife and the only attraction still visible to the naked eye is the island&#x27;s original dock and maintenance dock, both of which are located on the top side of the island from viewing by the Wilderness Lodge. They are both gated off.

The smaller of the two islands is named Shipwreck Island and is located between the Contemporary and Wilderness Lodge resorts, directly in front of the water bridge.

== Uses ==
Bay Lake is primarily used for recreational boating, offered at each of the three marinas connected to it, as well as the two additional marinas located on Seven Seas Lagoon. Fishing is not allowed in Bay Lake with the exception of fishing excursions which must be booked ahead of time. After dark fireworks cruises are offered on Bay Lake as well. The north section of the lake is reserved for watersports activities, which are operated by Sammy Duval Watersports at the Contemporary Resort. Several times a year triathlons are held, usually from the Fort Wilderness Campground. In addition, transportation boats run regular routes from each of the three resorts and several offer routes to the Magic Kingdom.

<doc id="1317862" wikidata="Q333216" url="?curid=1317862" title="Augustine Birrell">
<text>Augustine Birrell KC (19 January 1850 – 20 November 1933) was a British Liberal Party politician, who was Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1907 to 1916. In this post, he was praised for enabling tenant farmers to own their property, and for extending university education for Catholics, but was criticised for failing to take action against the rebels before the Easter Rising, leading to his subsequent resignation. A barrister by training, he was also an author, noted for humorous essays.

==Early life==
Birrell was born in Wavertree, Liverpool the son of The Rev. Charles Mitchell Birrell (1811–1880), a Scottish Baptist minister and Harriet Jane Grey (1811–1863) daughter of Rev Henry Grey of Edinburgh.

He was educated at Amersham Hall school and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was made an Honorary Fellow in 1879. He joined the Sylvan Debating Club in 1872. He started work in a solicitor&#x27;s office in Liverpool but was called to the Bar in 1875, becoming a KC in 1893 and a Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1903. From 1896 to 1899 he was Professor of Comparative Law at University College, London. In 1911 Birrell served as Lord Rector of Glasgow University.

His first wife, Margaret Mirrielees, died in 1879, only a year after their marriage, and in 1888 he married Eleanor Tennyson, daughter of the poet Frederick Locker-Lampson and widow of Lionel Tennyson, son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. They had two sons, one of whom, Frankie (1889–1935) was later a journalist and critic and associated with the Bloomsbury Group. Birrell found success as a writer with the publication of a volume of essays entitled &quot;Obiter Dicta&quot; in 1884. This was followed by a second series of &quot;Obiter Dicta&quot; in 1887 and &quot;Res Judicatae&quot; in 1892. These, despite their titles, were not concerned with law, but he also wrote books on copyright and on trusts. Birrell wrote, and spoke, with a characteristic humour which became known as &quot;birrelling&quot;.

==Entry into politics==
After unsuccessfully contesting parliamentary seats in Liverpool, Walton in 1885 and Widnes in 1886, Birrell was elected to parliament for West Fife at a by-election in 1889, as a Liberal. He retained his seat in the general elections of 1892 and 1895, but in the general election of 1900 he stood in Manchester North East and was defeated. In 1903 he edited &quot;Eight Years of Tory Government&quot;, a &quot;handbook for the use of Liberals&quot;, which attacked the incumbent Conservative administration&#x27;s record on issues such as housing and worker&#x27;s compensation.

==President of the Board of Education==
In December 1905 Birrell was included in the cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman as President of the Board of Education, and that month he was sworn of the Privy Council. He was returned for Bristol North at the general election of January 1906, in which the Liberals won a large majority. Like Campbell-Bannerman, Birrell belonged to the Radical tradition of the party. Birrell also belonged to a group called the &quot;New Radicals&quot; or &quot;New Liberals&quot;, which also included H. H. Asquith, R. B. Haldane and Sir Edward Grey.

Birrell introduced the Education Bill 1906, intended to address nonconformist grievances arising from the Education Act 1902. The bill passed the Liberal-dominated House of Commons comfortably, but the House of Lords, with a Conservative majority, passed wrecking amendments which undermined its meaning, and the government dropped it. This use of dilatory parliamentary procedures and wrecking amendments over the education bill began a period of political tension between the Commons and Lords which ultimately concluded with the Lords&#x27; rejection of the People&#x27;s Budget of 1909, sparking the Constitutional Crises of 1909–11.

Birrell had been seen as a poor advocate for the bill, although he complained privately that it was mainly Lloyd George&#x27;s work, and that he himself had had little say over its contents. The defeat of the bill made it impossible for Birrell to continue in his post, and in January 1907 he was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, to replace James Bryce who had been made Ambassador to the United States. While serving in government, Birrell supported a number of progressive measures and proposals such as expanded housing provisions, land reform, and substantial increases in education spending at both primary and secondary level.

==Birrell and Women&#x27;s Suffrage==
Like many of his political colleagues and members of the general public, Birrell strongly disapproved of the militancy and violence of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU; suffragettes). In November 1910, when walking alone from the House of Commons, he was set upon by a group of about twenty suffragettes who had recognised him. While he did not believe there was any serious attempt to injure him, in trying to escape he twisted his knee and &quot;slipped the knee-cap&quot;. C. P. Scott wrote in his diary that Birrell feared he might require an operation to remove his kneecap and joked that, if he did, he would remain &quot;a weak-kneed politician&quot; to the end of his life. Birrell was, however, described by the paper &quot;Votes for Women&quot; as one of a number of &quot;Suffragist members of the Cabinet&quot; who met with a deputation from the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), led by Millicent Fawcett, on 8 August 1913, following a similar meeting by the NUWSS with Prime Minister Asquith on the same day. According to &quot;Votes for Women&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the ministers asked the deputation what kind of bill the NUWSS was looking for. Other ministers present included Lloyd George, John Simon, Francis Dyke Acland and Thomas McKinnon Wood.

==Chief Secretary for Ireland==
===Council Bill, Universities Bill and Land Bill===

Birrell&#x27;s first Under-Secretary and head of Irish Civil Service at Dublin Castle administration was Sir Antony MacDonnell, who had worked successfully with a previous Chief Secretary, George Wyndham, on the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903. MacDonnell was a well-known advocate for Home Rule. MacDonnell&#x27;s proposals for what was called &quot;devolution&quot; – the transfer of local powers to Ireland under a central authority – adopted by the Irish Reform Association&#x27;s - had encountered strong opposition from Unionists, leading eventually to Wyndham&#x27;s resignation. This proposal ultimately passed from Sir James Bryce with Birrell inheriting the bill. Birrell modified MacDonnell&#x27;s proposal and on 7 May 1907 introduced the Irish Council Bill. The bill was initially welcomed by Nationalist leaders John Redmond and John Dillon, and opposed, for different reasons, by unionists and by more radical nationalists who wanted nothing less than Home Rule for Ireland. At a convention of the United Irish League, opposition was so strong that Redmond changed his position; the convention rejected the bill and the government was unable to proceed with it. Birrell suffered further embarrassment when he sought to discontinue the use of the Irish Crimes Act 1887, a coercive measure introduced by Arthur Balfour to deal with agrarian crime, only to be faced with an increase in cattle-driving. Another affair, in which Birrell was not directly involved but for which he had to take part of the blame, was the theft of the Irish Crown Jewels from Dublin Castle (where the Chief Secretary had his offices) in July 1907.

Birrell had more success in areas such as Education and the Irish land question. His excellent relations with both Roman Catholic and Protestant church leaders such as the Archbishop of Dublin William Walsh ensured the successful passage of the Irish Universities Bill 1908, which established the National University of Ireland and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast and dissolved the Royal University of Ireland. It solved the sectarian problem in higher education by dividing the Protestant and Catholic traditions into their own separate spheres and ensured Catholic, Nationalist scholars had access to university education. Contemporaries also praised his achievement in carrying the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act (1909), which though falling far short in its financial provisions allowed for compulsory purchase by the Land Commission of large areas of land for the relief of congestion, through a hostile House of Lords.

===Home Rule Bill===

After the passing, with the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party, of the Parliament Act 1911, which restricted the power of the Lords to veto bills, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith introduced the Third Home Rule Bill on 16 April 1912. The Unionists, led in Ireland by Edward Carson and in Britain by Tory leader Bonar Law, formed a private army, the Ulster Volunteers, to resist enforcement of the act, and Carson proposed an amendment excluding Ulster from the scope of the bill. Birrell was opposed to the exclusion of any part of the country and when David Lloyd George proposed a compromise involving the exclusion of six of the nine counties of Ulster for a period of five to six years Birrell responded by offering his resignation. Historian Ronan Fanning, in a newspaper article, has described him as &quot;the arch hypocrite&quot; because of his public criticisms of such exclusion proposals, but private acceptance of same. The proposal was rejected by both Unionists and Nationalists and Birrell stayed on. In fact, by that stage Lloyd George had effectively replaced Birrell as the Liberal government&#x27;s negotiator in the Home Rule discussions. The crisis continued through 1913 and into 1914. The bill was introduced for the third time in July 1914, this time along with an amending bill allowing for the exclusion of some of the Ulster counties, but with the outbreak of World War I the bill was passed without further debate, with its implementation suspended until after the war. However, on the collapse of Asquith&#x27;s Liberal-dominated government in May 1915 and its replacement with a coalition involving Carson, the implementation of Home Rule at any stage became moot.

===World War===
In the latter part of 1915, Birrell was one of those Liberal ministers (others being Reginald McKenna (Chancellor of the Exchequer), Walter Runciman (President of the Board of Trade) and Sir Edward Grey (Foreign Secretary)) who were unhappy at the realignment of Britain&#x27;s war effort towards conscription, total war and a massive commitment of troops to the Western Front, as advocated by the CIGS Archibald Murray. However, none of these joined Sir John Simon (Home Secretary) in resigning in protest at the conscription of bachelors, due to be enacted in January 1916. However, Birrell wrote to the Prime Minister (29 December) criticizing Murray and arguing that he and Runciman agreed that finance and strategic policy were more important than conscription. Conscription was only applied in Britain, not Ireland.

===Easter Rising===
A further threat to Birrell&#x27;s administration had arisen with the formation in November 1913 of the Irish Volunteers, ostensibly to safeguard Home rule but in fact, under the influence of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) aiming to break the union with Britain altogether. Feelings in nationalist Ireland were further aroused by the possibility of conscription. Sir Matthew Nathan, Birrell&#x27;s Under-Secretary since October 1914, told him in September 1915 that the Nationalist Party was losing ground in the country and that extreme nationalists, often referred to as &quot;Sinn Féiners&quot;, were gaining support. Nathan took measures such as suppressing newspapers and forcing Irish Volunteer organisers to leave the country. The Irish Party leaders, Redmond and Dillon, cautioned against taking direct action against the &#x27;Sinn Féiners&#x27; and the administration kept to that policy. Birrell himself felt that the danger of a bomb outrage was greater than that of an insurrection. His assessment was proved wrong when the Easter Rising began on 24 April 1916.

Birrell had spent Easter in London, where Nathan had telegraphed him with news of the capture and scuttling of the arms ship the &quot;Aud&quot; and the arrest of Sir Roger Casement. He had just sent approval for the arrest of the movement&#x27;s leaders on Easter Monday morning when he was told by Viscount French, Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Forces, that the Rising had begun. He maintained contact with Nathan by telegraph and answered questions in Parliament on Tuesday and Wednesday, then travelled by destroyer to Dublin, arriving in the early hours of Thursday morning. From there he wrote to the Prime Minister, giving him his assessment of the situation. In one of his letters he wrote that he &#x27;couldn&#x27;t go on&#x27;. On 1 May, the day after the Rising ended, Asquith accepted his resignation &#x27;with infinite regret&#x27;. This regret was also felt by both Nationalist and Unionist politicians in Parliament. While some, such as Laurence Ginnell celebrated his departure, both John Redmond and Sir Edward Carson praised the work Birrell completed during his time as chief secretary. Others, such as the Irish civil servant, Sir Henry Robinson, also praised the work Birrell completed and highlighted in his memoirs the number of Acts of Parliament Birrell was responsible for. However, The Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) was critical of Birrell and Nathan, in particular their failure to take action against the rebels in the weeks and months before the Rising. Birrell acknowledged in his memoirs that he did not stoutly defend himself in front of the commission. However, the commission did understand that Birrell was confined to London due to his cabinet and parliamentary duties between 1914 and 1916.

==Personal life==

While Birrell&#x27;s first phase as Chief Secretary was a clear success, the period from about 1912 onwards saw something of a decline in Birrell&#x27;s career which was also mirrored in his domestic life. Birrell&#x27;s second wife Eleanor had been suffering from an inoperable brain tumour and this eventually caused her to lose her sanity. This affected Birrell deeply, privately and publicly, but he did not tell his political colleagues, who were simply given to understand that she did not care for social life. There were two sons of the marriage, Francis and Anthony.

The quality of his public work deteriorated and as one historian has noted the severe personal strain must have been a contributory factor in &quot;...the uncharacteristic combination of excessive zeal and indecision which marked [Birrell&#x27;s] response to the Dublin industrial agitation of 1913&quot;. Only after Eleanor died in 1915 did Birrell begin to regain some of his old energy and effectiveness as a minister.

==Later life==
Birrell did not defend his seat in the 1918 general election, nor did he ever return to Ireland. In 1929, he accepted an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, but storms in the Irish Sea prevented him from making the crossing and he had to receive his degree &quot;in absentia&quot;. He returned to literature with a further volume of essays and book reviews, &quot;More Obiter Dicta&quot; (1920) and a book on his father-in-law, Frederick Locker-Lampson. He died in London on 20 November 1933, aged eighty-three. His autobiography, &quot;Things Past Redress&quot;, was published posthumously.

<text>DigBoston—formerly known as the Weekly Dig and colloquially as The Dig—was a free alternative newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts. It covered news in the Greater Boston area and offers commentary on music, arts, politics, business, film, sex, food, drink and more, as well as providing local bar, entertainment and club listings. &quot;DigBoston&quot; was distributed Thursdays, free of charge, in self-serve newspaper dispensers located throughout the city, as well as in local businesses.

==History==
The &quot;Weekly Dig&quot; was founded in September 1999, by Jeff Lawrence, Joe Bonni and Craig Kapilow. Previously, Lawrence had published a monthly magazine called &quot;Shovel&quot; founded in 1997. Bonni had run &quot;The Pit Report&quot; a regional monthly rock and roll magazine from 1992 - 1995 and had worked in advertising at &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; where he was also a freelance writer. &quot;Shovel&quot; discontinued publishing in the Spring of 2000, when it became an insert to the &quot;Weekly Dig&quot;.

In September 2003, Lawrence moved to change the editorial direction by dismissing founding Editor Joe Bonni. Assistant Editor (and junior partner) Seth McM. Donlin was named interim editor; Joe Keohane was appointed the replacement editor later in 2003.

In October 2004, &quot;Boston&quot; magazine publisher Metrocorp announced that it bought a majority stake in the &quot;Weekly Dig&quot;. Metrocorp, which had operated Boston magazine since 1971 at the time, was also publishing &quot;Elegant Wedding&quot;, &quot;Concierge&quot;, &quot;Home &amp; Garden&quot; and &quot;New England Travel and Life&quot;. It had also been operating &quot;Philadelphia&quot; since 1946.

Three months later, in January 2005, the paper went through a relaunch that offered a new, updated design and broader content. Since then, its circulation has more than doubled to about 70,000 copies distributed weekly.

In May, 2007, Lawrence announced that he had purchased the paper back from Metrocorp in what both sides called &quot;an amicable divorce&quot;.

In 2009, Arts and Entertainment Editor David Day was made editor-in-chief. Shortly thereafter, the name &quot;Weekly Dig&quot; was dropped, and the organization was re-branded as &quot;DigBoston,&quot; featuring a completely overhauled website, DigBoston.com. Day left in 2012, and the new editor was former Managing Editor J. Patrick Brown.

When the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; folded in March 2013, &quot;DigBoston&quot; became the area&#x27;s only remaining alt-weekly publication. A new staff was installed, including Dan McCarthy (editor), Chris Faraone (news and features editor), Susanna Jackson (arts and entertainment editor), Kris Jenson (associate film editor), Sean Maloney (staff writer), and Marc Shepard (associate publisher).

&quot;DigBoston&quot; was acquired by Dig Media Group in June 2017. The new owners and top staff were Marc Sneider (publisher), Chris Faraone (editor-in-chief and associate publisher), Jason Pramas (executive editor and associate publisher), and John Loftus (business manager and associate publisher).

In September 2018, Dig Media Group announced that Marc Sneider had stepped down as publisher and that its board of directors &quot;elected DigBoston Business Manager (and former Associate Publisher) John Loftus to be the new publisher”.

In June 2023, DigBoston stopped publication after being unable to recover from &quot;the pandemic economy.&quot;

<doc id="1317931" wikidata="Q180464" url="?curid=1317931" title="Afonso Pena International Airport">
<text>Curitiba-President Afonso Pena International Airport is the main airport serving Curitiba, located in the municipality of São José dos Pinhais, in the state of Paraná. Since July 15, 1985 it is named after Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena (1847–1909), the 6th President of Brazil.

It is operated by CCR.

==History==

As was the case with many important Brazilian airports located in strategic points along the coast, Afonso Pena, was built by the Brazilian Air Force Ministry in partnership with the United States Army during the Second World War. However, since its construction was completed only in 1945, shortly before the end of the war, Afonso Pena never saw heavy military movement. On January 24, 1946, it was dedicated as a civil airport.

The original passenger terminal was in use until 1959 when a new terminal was built. This terminal is used until 1996 when the much bigger terminal opened. After the new terminal opened, the older terminal became a cargo terminal. 

The unstable weather conditions of the region are the main problem with the airport, particularly fog and smog in the morning hours of winter and the fact that the auxiliary runway 11/29 is too small and plagued with old equipment. There are also plans to upgrade runway 15/33 from an ILS CAT II runway to ILS CAT III.

Since the bottleneck for the airport is the cargo capacity, the main runway was lengthened in 2008 to allow cargo flights to operate with greater loads and the cargo terminal was upgraded.

On 31 August 2009, Infraero unveiled a BRL30 million (USD16 million; EUR11 million) investment plan to upgrade Afonso Pena International Airport focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup which were held in Brazil, Curitiba being one of the venue cities. The investment included the enlargement of the apron and implementation of taxiways. The terminal is 45,000 m2, has 14 jetways, and is capable of handling 15 million passengers annually. There are 800 parking places. The airport complex includes a small museum, a playcenter and a mall with 60 stores inside the main terminal.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Curitiba was considered to be requiring attention, operating between 70% and 85% of its capacity. American Airlines launched service to Miami in November 2013. The outbound flight operated via Porto Alegre, while the inbound one was nonstop. The carrier terminated the route in February 2016.

Previously operated by Infraero, on April 7, 2021, CCR won a 30-year concession to operate the airport.

==Statistics==
 
Following is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2021) and CCR (2022-2024) reports:


==Accidents and incidents==
*16 June 1958: a Cruzeiro do Sul Convair 440, registration PP-CEP, flying from Florianópolis to Curitiba, was on final approach procedures to land at Curitiba in bad weather when it was caught in windshear. The aircraft descended and struck the ground. Of the 27 passengers and crew aboard, 24 died. Among the deaths was the Brazilian interim president at that time, Nereu Ramos.
*3 November 1967: a Sadia Handley Page Dart Herald, registration PP-SDJ, flying from São Paulo-Congonhas to Curitiba, collided with a hill during approach to land at Curitiba. All 5 crew members and 21 passengers died. 4 passengers survived.
*16 August 2000: a VASP Boeing 737-200 registration PP-SMG, en route from Foz do Iguaçu to Curitiba, was hijacked by 5 persons demanding the BRL 5 million (approximately US$2.75 million at that time) that the aircraft was transporting. The pilot was forced to land at Porecatu, where the hijackers fled with the money. There were no injuries.
*26 December 2002: a Brazilian Air Force Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, registration FAB-2292, en route from São Paulo-Campo de Marte to Florianópolis Air Force Base, crashed while trying to carry out an emergency landing at Curitiba-Afonso Pena. Reportedly, both engines had shut down. The airplane had taken off with insufficient fuel on board to complete the flight to Florianópolis. Of the 16 people on board, 1 crew member and 2 passengers died.

<doc id="1317932" wikidata="Q1323582" url="?curid=1317932" title="HMS Britannia (1904)">
<text>HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; was a &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class pre-dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy. She was named after Britannia, the Latin name of Great Britain under Roman rule. The ship was built by Portsmouth Dockyard between 1904 and 1906. Armed with a battery of four and four guns, she and her sister ships marked a significant advance in offensive power compared to earlier British battleship designs that did not carry the 9.2 in guns.

After commissioning in September 1906, she served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet from October to March 1907 before transferring to the Channel Fleet. She then joined the Home Fleet in 1909. In 1912, she, along with her sister ships, was assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron, part of the Home Fleet. That year, the squadron went to the Mediterranean Sea during the First Balkan War as part of an international blockade of Montenegro. In 1913, the ship returned to British waters, where she was reassigned to the Second Division, Home Fleet.

When the First World War broke out, &quot;Britannia&quot; was transferred back to the 3rd Battle Squadron, which was assigned to the Grand Fleet, the main British fleet during the war. Through 1914 and 1915, the ships frequently went to sea to search for German vessels, but &quot;Britannia&quot; saw no action during this period. By the end of the year, the Grand Fleet stopped operating with the older 3rd Battle Squadron ships, and in 1916, she was attached to the 2nd Detached Squadron, then serving in the Adriatic Sea. After a refit in 1917, she conducted patrol and convoy escort duties in the Atlantic. On 9 November 1918, just two days before the end of the war, she was torpedoed by a German submarine off Cape Trafalgar and sank with the loss of 50 men. &quot;Britannia&quot; was one of the last British warships to be sunk in the war.

==Design==


Following the development of pre-dreadnought type battleships carrying heavy secondary guns of diameter in the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; and the United States Navy, the Royal Navy decided to build similar ships. Initial proposals called for a battleship equipped with eight guns to support the main battery, though under the direction of William Henry White, the Director of Naval Construction, these were replaced with four guns. The new ships, though based on the general type that had formed the basis of the preceding four battleship designs, marked the first significant change in the series. Like all late pre-dreadnoughts that entered service in the mid-1900s, &quot;Britannia&quot; was made almost instantaneously obsolescent by the commissioning of the all-big-gun in December 1906, armed with a battery of ten heavy guns compared to the typical four of most pre-dreadnoughts.

&quot;Britannia&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 777 officers and ratings. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by sixteen water-tube boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from .

&quot;Britannia&quot; had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These were supported by a heavy secondary battery of four guns in four single turrets, two on each broadside. The ships also mounted ten 6-inch 50 calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to fourteen 12-pounder guns and fourteen 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with five torpedo tubes submerged in the hull; two were on each broadside, with the fifth in the stern.

&quot;Britannia&quot; had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. The sides of her main battery turrets were also 8 to 12 in thick, atop 12 in barbettes, and the 9.2 turrets had sides. The casemate battery was protected with of armour plate. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==

===Pre-First World War===
HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; was built at Portsmouth Dockyard, and was named for the Latin name for Great Britain under Roman rule. She was laid down on 4 February 1904, launched on 10 December that year, and completed in September 1906. &quot;Britannia&quot; was commissioned into the reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 6 September 1906. She went into full commission on 2 October 1906 for service in the Atlantic Fleet. She transferred to the Channel Fleet on 4 March 1907. As part of a fleet reorganisation on 24 March 1909, the Channel Fleet became the Second Division, Home Fleet, and &quot;Britannia&quot; became a Home Fleet unit in that division, becoming Flagship, Vice Admiral, Second Division, in April 1909. She underwent a refit at Portsmouth from 1909 to 1910. On 14 July 1910, she collided with the barque &quot;Loch Trool&quot;, suffering slight damage.

Under a fleet reorganisation in May 1912, &quot;Britannia&quot; and all seven of her sisters (, , , , , , and ) were assigned to form the 3rd Battle Squadron, assigned to the First Fleet, Home Fleet. The squadron was detached to the Mediterranean in November because of the First Balkan War (October 1912 – May 1913); it arrived at Malta on 27 November and subsequently participated in a blockade by an international force of Montenegro and in an occupation of Scutari. The squadron returned to the United Kingdom in 1913 and rejoined the Home Fleet on 27 June , after which &quot;Britannia&quot; left the squadron to return to the Second Division, Home Fleet.

===First World War===
====With the Grand Fleet====
Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron, at the time under the command of Vice-Admiral Edward Bradford, was assigned to the Grand Fleet and based at Rosyth, where it was reinforced with the five s, It was used to supplement the Grand Fleet&#x27;s cruisers on the Northern Patrol. On 6 August, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, elements of the Grand Fleet sortied to inspect the coast of Norway in search of a German naval base violating Norwegian neutrality. &quot;Britannia&quot; and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron provided distant support to the operation. No such base was found, and the ships returned to port the next day. On 14 August, the ships of the Grand Fleet went to sea for battle practice before conducting a sweep into the North Sea later that day and into 15 August. During sweeps by the fleet, she and her sisters often steamed at the heads of divisions of the far more valuable dreadnoughts, where they could protect the dreadnoughts by watching for mines or by being the first to strike them. On 2 November 1914, the squadron was detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet and was rebased at Portland. It returned to the Grand Fleet on 13 November 1914.

On 14 December, the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, 2nd Battle Squadron, and accompanying cruisers and destroyers left port to intercept the German forces preparing to raid Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. On the first reports of contact with German units on the morning of 16 December, the Grand Fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe, ordered Bradford to take the 3rd Battle Squadron to support the ships in contact at 10:00. Four hours later, they met the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons, en route from Scapa Flow, though they failed to reach the German High Seas Fleet before the latter withdrew. The Grand Fleet remained at sea until late on 17 December, at which point the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered back to Rosyth. &quot;Britannia&quot; and the rest of the squadron joined the Grand Fleet for another sweep into the North Sea on 25 December. The fleet returned to its ports two days later, having failed to locate any German vessels.

The 3rd Battle Squadron went to sea on 12 January 1915 for gunnery training, steaming north and passing to the west of Orkney on the night of 13–14 January. After completing training on the 14th, they returned to Rosyth on 15 January. On 23 January, the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons sortied to ambush the German I Scouting Group in what resulted in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. Later on the 23rd, the rest of the Grand Fleet, including &quot;Britannia&quot;, sortied to support the battlecruisers. The 3rd Squadron ships left first and steamed at full speed to reach ships of the Harwich Force, which had reported contact with German vessels. The battlecruisers intervened first, and &quot;Britannia&quot; and her sisters arrived around 14:00, by which time the battlecruisers had sunk the armoured cruiser and the surviving German ships had fled. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the area with the rest of the Grand Fleet over the night before being detached at 08:00 on 25 January to steam to Rosyth. While steaming in the Firth of Forth off Inchkeith the next day, &quot;Britannia&quot; ran aground. She was stranded for 36 hours but was refloated; having suffered extensive damage, the ship required lengthy repairs at the Devonport Dockyard.

====Later operations====
On 29 April 1916, the 3rd Battle Squadron was rebased at Sheerness, and on 3 May it was separated from the Grand Fleet, being transferred to the Nore Command. &quot;Britannia&quot; remained there with the squadron until August, when she began a refit at Portsmouth Dockyard. On completion of her refit in September, &quot;Britannia&quot; transferred out of the 3rd Battle Squadron for service in the 2nd Detached Squadron, which had been organised in 1915 to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet for active operations. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.

She underwent a refit at Gibraltar in February–March 1917, and on its completion was attached to the 9th Cruiser Squadron to serve on the Atlantic Patrol and on convoy escort duty, based mainly at Sierra Leone. She relieved the armoured cruiser as flagship of the 9th Cruiser Squadron in March and underwent a refit at Bermuda in May, during which her 6-inch guns were removed and replaced by four 6-inch guns in shielded pivot mounts on her shelter deck, in place of where the 12-pounder guns had been located.

====Loss====

On the morning of 9 November 1918, under the command of Captain Francis Wade Caulfeild, &quot;Britannia&quot; was on a voyage in the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar when she was torpedoed off Cape Trafalgar by the German submarine &quot;UB-50&quot;. After the first explosion, the ship listed ten degrees to port. A few minutes later, a second explosion started a fire in a 9.2-inch magazine, which in turn caused a cordite explosion in the magazine. Darkness below decks made it virtually impossible to find the flooding valves for the magazines, and those the crew did find were poorly located and therefore hard to turn, and the resulting failure to properly flood the burning magazine probably doomed the ship. &quot;Britannia&quot; held her 10-degree list for 2 and a half hours before sinking, allowing most of the crew to be taken off. Most of the men who were lost were killed by toxic smoke from burning cordite; 50 men died and 80 were injured. In total, 39 officers and 673 men were saved.

&quot;Britannia&quot; was sunk only two days before the Armistice ending the First World War was signed on 11 November 1918. She was one of the last British warships lost in the war.

<doc id="1317934" wikidata="Q4893003" url="?curid=1317934" title="Bernard Clergue">
<text>Bernard Clergue was the town &quot;bayle&quot; of the village of Montaillou in the south of France in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. A great deal about his life is recorded in the Fournier Register and has been studied by historians, most notably Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie in his book &quot;Montaillou&quot;.

== Biography ==
Bernard was a member of the powerful Clergue family, the wealthiest in the village. He was the son of Pons and Mengarde Clergue and the brother of Pierre Clergue. While Pierre became the village priest, and thus the local representative of the church, Bernard became the bayle, the representative of the government. The bayle was the tax collector and the main enforcer of law and order in the town, reporting to the châtelain who ruled to town for the Comté de Foix.

While Bernard was one of the few educated and literate people in the town he was still a peasant and most of his work was farming. As bayle he farmed not only his own land, but also that of the Comté. This included the land seized from Cathar heretics. As with the rest of the family Bernard himself was a staunch Cathar, but was for a long time protected by his wealth and connections.

While not as great a womanizer as his brother Pierre, Bernard did father a child out of wedlock: Mengarde Clergue, who later married Raymond Aymeric of Prades d&#x27;Aillon. Bernard later fell deeply in love with Raymonde Belot, whom he married.

== Arrest and death ==
Pierre was the unquestioned leader of the family and Bernard was devastated when he was arrested by the inquisition. Bernard reported that he had lost his &quot;god&quot; and his &quot;ruler&quot;. He thus went to great ends to try to free Pierre, including dispensing some 14,000 sous in bribes, a great deal of money at the time.

Bernard himself was arrested by the inquisition in 1324, after a month in prison he died in the summer of that year.

<text>RoboTurb is a welding robot used to repair turbine blades developed at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. It is a redundant robot with a flexible rail.

The Roboturb project started in 1998 at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina initially with the support of the Brazilian Government and the public power utility
company COPEL – Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica.

Three phases followed, and now the project is mainly maintained by another public power utility company FURNAS – Furnas Centrais Eletricas.

<text>The Sous region (also spelt Sus, Suss, Souss or Sousse) (, ) is a historical, cultural and geographical region of Morocco, which constitutes part of the region administration of Souss-Massa and Guelmim-Oued Noun. The region is known for the endemic argan tree (which has become a symbol of Souss) as well as for being the capital of the Shilha Berber ethnic group. It is a major commercial and tourist agricultural region of Morocco. Vegetable production, shared between very large farms and small producers, contributes to the economic development of the region. The Souss plain produces 40% of Moroccan citrus fruits, and 60% of the production of early vegetables. It is historically a stage of trans-Saharan trade.

== History ==
Medieval Arab geographers generally divided the Sous region into two distinct sub-regions: as-Sūs al-Aqṣā ( &#x27;the far Sus&#x27;), or , and as-Sūs al-Adnā ( &#x27;the near Sus&#x27;). &quot;Sus al-Aqsa&quot; consisted of the southern/western part, and &quot;Sus al-Adna&quot; consisted of the northern/eastern part; however, there were never any precise boundaries between the two. The capital of the Sous was at Igli. There was also a ribat at Massa near the Atlantic coast.

Around 683, Uqba ibn Nafi conquered the Sous region, but after his death in 688 his conquests in Morocco slipped out of Muslim control. The Sous was reconquered around 20 years later by Musa ibn Nusayr, who began the spread of Islam among the local population.

<text>Hermosa is one of 77 designated Chicago community areas and is located on the northwest side of Chicago, Illinois. The Hermosa community area contains the Kelvyn Park and Hermosa neighborhoods. The area includes the birthplace of Walt Disney and is the former headquarters of the Schwinn Bicycle Company. While being one of the smaller community areas, Hermosa is one of the city&#x27;s most densely populated neighborhoods.

Today, Hermosa is a predominantly Hispanic blue collar community, with a sizable manufacturing base. Many of the people who reside in Hermosa have done so because of its convenient location to work, its relative proximity to downtown, and because of its healthy public transportation options. The Consulate-General of Honduras in Chicago is located in Hermosa at 4439 West Fullerton Avenue.

On December 31, 2018, the Hermosa Bungalow Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Background==

The Hermosa area originated as one of the many suburban crabgrass communities of Jefferson Township. The first verifiable proof of European settlement in the area occurred in the early 1880s after railroads were constructed through the area. In 1872, an extension of the Chicago and Pacific Rail Road was extended, passing through Hermosa from east to west. One of the first settlers was named Mr. Lathman, who built his house in the spring of 1882. In the same year, James F. Keeney, who owned much of the land that now comprises Hermosa, started building a number of houses within his subdivision. In 1884, the first large scale successful industrial enterprise, the Laminated Wood Company, was founded. In 1886 several other factories were also established such as the Expanded Metal Company, the Eclipse Furnace Company, and a warehouse belonging to the Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company. The Keeney Company actively promoted the growth of Hermosa and ultimately helped convince the railroad to build a station in the area, which Mr. Kenney constructed at his own expense. By 1884, there were 30 houses and 150 people living in Hermosa, most of these original settlers were Scotch, German and Swedish immigrants. The first schools and churches were established in the area in the late 1880s and 1890s.

The first name for Hermosa was likely &quot;Pacific,&quot; but there is no verifiable record to prove this. The first official name for the area was Garfield, in honor of the late president. In 1885 the name of the town was changed to Hermosa for the reason of establishing a post office at Kenney&#x27;s rail station—there already was a post office named Garfield and the name could not be duplicated. A Mr. Peebles, secretary to the superintendent of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail Road, is credited with suggesting the name Hermosa, which means beautiful in Spanish.

In the fall of 1889, Hermosa was annexed into the City of Chicago. The area grew slowly throughout the remainder of the 19th century and was mostly characterized by the construction of simple worker&#x27;s cottages, but began to see rapid growth in the first two decades of the 20th century. Streetcars were extended through the community along Armitage Avenue in 1895, Fullerton Avenue in 1914, and Belmont Avenue in 1917. The Hermosa Improvement Association was organized in 1912 for the purpose of securing needed improvements including a park. The organization is primarily responsible for the establishment of Hermosa Park. By 1920 Hermosa had swelled to over 15,000 residents. Hermosa went through a building boom during this decade; most of the area neighborhood of Kelvyn Park was built out during this decade and was composed mostly of brick bungalows and two-flats. In addition, the remaining open land in southern Hermosa was built out and filled with brick bungalows, two- and three-flats, and smaller 5+ unit apartment buildings. With Hermosa being surrounded by railroad tracks on three sides, industrial development continued to occur along these railroad tracks and along industrial spurs throughout the 1920s. One of the more notable industrial players was the Schwinn Bicycle Company, which had its headquarters and manufacturing base in Hermosa at 1718 N. Kildare Ave. &amp; 1856 N. Kostner Ave, respectively. Schwinn had facilities in Hermosa from 1895 to 1982. The railroads also created many dead-end streets in Hermosa, which isolated residents geographically from surrounding communities, but also created a sense of security. By the end of the 1920s, Hermosa&#x27;s infrastructure and building stock was nearly completely built out, representing much of the community as it exists today. Indeed, the average median age of a home in Hermosa (in 2012) dates back to 1919, with nearly 63% of the structures in the community having been built before 1940. 

By the 1930s Hermosa&#x27;s population had grown to over 23,500 residents. The area was populated primarily by Germans, Scandinavians with newer groups of Poles, Hungarians, and Austrians. After an expansive period, Hermosa&#x27;s population began to decline, most prominently in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1960s, Puerto Ricans had become the largest ethnicity in the area. By 1980, the population had decreased below 20,000 with over a third of the population being Hispanic. In 1980, Hermosa was still principally a white community of mostly older Polish, German and Irish ethnicities. The decade of the 1980s proved to be a monumental one for Hermosa, however, transforming the area into a mostly Hispanic community.
In the 1980s, Hermosa’ population swelled dramatically and the ethnic composition shifted radically, changing from one-thirds Hispanic to two-thirds Hispanic by the end of the decade. Puerto Ricans remained the largest ethnic group, with a large Mexican community also establishing roots in the area. Most of the Hispanic population growth was concentrated in the areas south of Fullerton during the 1980s. The average size of households jumped dramatically in this decade, with large increases in the population of children 13 years or younger. Total population increased by 3,500 in the 1980s. Families in poverty increased during this time with a 17.4% poverty rate in 1989 and an unemployment rate of 10.9% in 1990. The percentage of overcrowded housing doubled in Hermosa to more than 10% (up from 4%). The housing situation deteriorated starting in the 1970s-1980s, with Hermosa having the second lowest number of housing repairs among the 77 communities. The first appearance of gang violence also appeared in Hermosa in the 1980s. Several organizations were created during this time including the United Neighbors in Action (1982) which primarily fought against a proposed increase in subsidized housing in the area. Neighbors joined to stop crime and gang violence. The Kelvyn Ken-Well Community Organization and the Hermosa Community Organization were two successful community organizations created during this time to combat crime. In 1992, nearly 800 neighbors marched from Kelvyn Park to Hanson Park to protest the continued presence of gangs.

The sustained increases in population helped Hermosa reach an all-time historical high of nearly 27,000 residents in 2000, making Hermosa one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Chicago at the time. By 2000, Hermosa had become 84% Hispanic, up from 68% in 1990. Issues of overcrowding and gang violence started to subside in the 1990s.

While Hermosa&#x27;s housing stock remained mostly buildings built prior to the 1940s many renovations and rehabs have occurred which have improved the housing stock in recent decades. In recent years Hermosa has seen some gentrification as surrounding areas, such as Logan Square and Avondale, have started to see rising housing prices and business activity. Hermosa is among the top 10 Chicago communities with the fastest increasing housing prices, with home prices having increased 33% since 2012–2014.

==Demographics==
Per the 2020 Census, there were 24,062 people residing in the Hermosa community area. Per the 2018-2022 American Community Survey five-year estimates, the racial makeup of the Hermosa community area was 12.4% non-Hispanic White, 3.5% non-Hispanic Black, 3.0% non-Hispanic Asian, and 1.1% non-Hispanic some other race. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 80.1% of the population.

UIC&#x27;s Gentrification Index classifies the Hermosa community area as a geographic region that has experienced ‘moderate decline’ over the period 1970 to 2010.

==Neighborhood boundaries==
Located 6 miles northwest of the Loop, Hermosa&#x27;s borders are mostly defined by railroad tracks and embankments.

===Walt Disney===
Hermosa is the birthplace of Walt Disney, born on December 5, 1901. The house Walt was born in was designed and built by his father and mother, Elias Disney and Flora Call Disney, in 1893. The home is located at the corner of Tripp Avenue and Palmer Street at 2156 North Tripp Avenue, formerly 1249 Tripp Avenue. The home was sold in 2013. The new owners intended to restore the home and hope to obtain landmark status for the structure. The City of Chicago attempted to designate the structure as a Historic Landmark in 1991, but the owner of the property at the time fought the designation. Brent Young, Dina Benadon, and Todd Regan, the executive director, are currently raising funds to repair the siding, install restoration windows and paint the structure.

<doc id="1317964" wikidata="Q210313" url="?curid=1317964" title="Fugloy">
<text>Fugloy (pronounced [ˈfʊglɪ], , ) is the easternmost island in the Faroe Islands.

The name means &quot;bird island,&quot; and refers to the large number of birds that nest on the island&#x27;s cliffs.

== Geography ==
There are two settlements:
*Kirkja on the south-coast and
*Hattarvík on the east-coast.

Fugloy is special because of the stone-material consisting of basalt stratum, making the island very steep and inaccessible. The Eystfelli cliffs, which are 448m are located on the east coast. Nearby on the 47-metre-high sea stack Stapin there is also a lighthouse, a natural arch feature and what looks like the outline of an Egyptian Pharaoh (the Pharaoh&#x27;s Face).

=== Mountains ===
There are three mountains on Fugloy:
==Flora and fauna==
=== Important Bird Area ===

The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially Atlantic puffins (15,000 pairs), European storm petrels (25,000 pairs) and black guillemots (100 pairs), as well as for about 50 breeding pairs of Eurasian whimbrels.

Fugloy was also a nesting site for the now extinct great auk (garefowl). On the east side of the island there is a rock ledge called &quot;Gorfuglarókin&quot; &quot;Garefowl Ledge&quot;, and written sources confirm that great auks were still breeding on Fugloy in the 18th century.

=== Mammals ===
Grey seals are regular visitors to the coastlines of Fugloy. Mountain hares were introduced by humans, and inhabit the higher altitudes on the island. Fugloy has its own subspecies of house mouse &quot;Mus musculus domesticus&quot;, as do some of the other Faroese islands.

=== Flora ===
In contrast to the other Norðoyar islands, Fugloy is green and fertile all the way up to the mountain tops. Some rare plants are found on the island, e.g. the Fugloy Eyebright &quot;Euphrasia foulaensis&quot;.


== History ==
The island has been populated since the Viking Age. One of the most important stories of the island is that of the Floksmenn. They were a flock (group) of rebels, in the Middle Ages, from Fugloy. The most notorious of the separatists, (referred by the Danish governmental officials in Tórshavn) were Høgni Nev, Rógvi Skel, Hálvdan Úlvsson and Sjúrður við Kellingará from Hattarvík. These men controlled and ravaged the northern parts of the Faroe Islands for a long time. This is one of the most important separatist myths of the Faroe islands.

The smarter Sjúrður við Kellingará was forced to go the more militant way of rebellion by Høgni Nev and Hálvdan Ulvsson who were more criminally minded. All the four men were later caught and sentenced to death. Sjúrður við kellingar was shown mercy and amnesty, but the story goes that he could not live with the crimes that he and the others had committed under their &quot;little&quot; rebellion and asked to be executed with the other Floksmenn.

Because the harbour of Fugloy is not protected by breakwaters, it has stopped any form of economic growth since the early 20th century. The island&#x27;s only income has been agriculture and some fishing, but also the famous catching of birds such as the puffin has been used on Fugloy to this day.

The Faroese parliament has tried to work out plans for the future of the island, such as the island getting electricity in the 1960s. In the 1980s a road from Kirkja to Hattarvík was built and a helicopter route to the island was established as well.

When the population was at its peak at the beginning of the 20th century, there were around 250–300 people living there. Due to a change in lifestyles and norms, island life has become less popular and people have moved away as a result. Today, there are only five people living all year around in Hattarvík and some 20 in Kirkja. There are few jobs on the islands; one shop and few jobs on the harbour are all that there are.

===Másin the mail boat===
Until taken out of service in 2010, the 1950s mail boat &quot;Másin&quot; was used as transit to Fugloy, making a popular attraction in itself. A newer boat is now used as a replacement but at Kirkja, passengers still have just a few minutes to jump ashore and get bags and their things with them. Oil for the electricity plant on Fugloy is transported in oil barrels and garbage is transported by the same boat and must be landed at the same time.

===Tourism===
The name Fugloy comes from the Faroese word &quot;fuglur&quot; for &quot;bird&quot; so it is not surprising that the island has a rich fauna of sea and land birds, especially puffins (Faroese: lundi) which inhabit the island in thousands. The view over to the nearest islands Svínoy and Borðoy is excellent, and sunsets that can be seen are among the things that make Fugloy feature in old pictures of the Faroe Islands.

== Mythology ==
There are several myths connected to this island. In old Faroese Culture trolls played a large part in the mythology of the Faroe Islands:

;The Floating Island of Fugloy

&quot;It was said that Fugloy was once a floating island with trolls living on it. Men had tried several times to approach the island, but every time they tried, the trolls threw stones and curses at the men in the boats. After a long time the men grew tired of trying and were close to leaving the trolls with the island. But one of the men, a priest, wanted to try one more time, before giving up. The men got in the boats again and rowed once more to Fugloy. In the first boat to approach the island were the priest and some other men. When the trolls saw what was happening, they started to collect stones, and began throwing them at the men. All the men in the first boat were scared and wanted to sail home again at once, with the big stones flying through the air! They were about to turn round and sail home, when the priest got so angry and was in such great despair that he threw the Bible that he had brought with him on the trip at the trolls. The Bible landed right in front of the trolls, the ground started shaking, the island stopped floating, and in a split second all the trolls were transformed into little grassy hills, and now the men could at last settle Fugloy. The little grassy hills are still located around the island, and particularly, close to the Bygd (Kirkja).&quot;

<text>The following is a list of state highways in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The state does not use a numbering convention. Generally, the two-digit odd numbered highways run north–south with a few exceptions; and even-numbered two-digit state highways run east–west with a few exceptions.

Arkansas has long had a stigma of poor roads, dating from the &quot;Arkansas Roads Scandal&quot; playing a prominent role in state politics through the 1920s and 1930s, periodic allegations of corruption, waste, and fraud, and a long-running struggle to adequately fund the operation, maintenance and expansion of a large highway system serving a rural state.

The state has received the designation of &quot;worst roads in America&quot; from several publications throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, with Interstate 30 and Interstate 40 often ranking particularly poorly among truckers. Rankings improved after a large construction project was completed on I-40.

A 2000 survey cited the poor condition of rural interstates, as well as narrow lanes on rural state highways, as areas of concern, ranking Arkansas 47th of the 50 states. A 2011 study found Arkansas&#x27;s rural highways fourth-most, and the state&#x27;s roads overall the 16th most deadly.

<doc id="1317987" wikidata="Q885488" url="?curid=1317987" title="Blow Out">
<text>Blow Out is a 1981 American neo-noir mystery thriller film written and directed by Brian De Palma. The film stars John Travolta as Jack Terry, a movie sound effects technician from Philadelphia who, while recording sounds for a low-budget slasher film, unintentionally captures audio evidence of an assassination involving a presidential hopeful. Nancy Allen stars as Sally Bedina, a young woman involved in the crime. The supporting cast includes John Lithgow and Dennis Franz. The film&#x27;s tagline in advertisements was, &quot;Murder has a sound all of its own&quot;.

Directly based on Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Blowup&quot;, the film replaces the medium of photography with one of audio recording. The concept of &quot;Blow Out&quot; came to De Palma while he was working on the thriller &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; (1980). The film was shot in the late autumn and winter of 1980 in various Philadelphia locations on a budget of $18 million.

&quot;Blow Out&quot; opened to very little audience interest at the time of release despite receiving a mostly positive critical reception. The lead performances by Travolta and Allen, the direction by De Palma and the visual style were cited as the strongest points of the film. Critics also recognised the stylistic and narrative connection to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, whom De Palma admires, and giallo films. Over the years since its initial theatrical release, it has developed status as a cult film and received a home media release by the Criterion Collection, a company which specializes in &quot;important classic and contemporary film,&quot; which re-ignited public interest in the film. Quentin Tarantino praises De Palma as the &quot;greatest director of his generation&quot; and cites &quot;Blow Out&quot; as one of his three favorite films that he would take to a desert island.

==Plot==
While in post-production on the low-budget slasher film &quot;Co-ed Frenzy&quot;, Philadelphia sound technician Jack Terry is instructed by his producer Sam to obtain a more realistic-sounding scream and better wind effects. While recording potential sound effects at a local park, he sees a car careen off the road and plunge into a creek. The male driver is killed, but Jack manages to rescue a young woman named Sally Bedina and accompanies her to a hospital. There, a detective interviews Jack about the accident, and Jack asks Sally out for a drink. He learns that Governor George McRyan, a presidential hopeful, was driving the car and that Sally was his escort. An associate of McRyan, Lawrence Henry, persuades Jack to conceal her involvement by smuggling her out of the hospital.

Listening to his recorded audio of the accident, Jack distinctly hears a gunshot just before the tire blow-out, suspecting that it was actually an assassination. He learns from a news report that, seemingly coincidentally, a man named Manny Karp filmed the accident with a motion picture camera. When Karp sells stills from his film to a local tabloid, &quot;News Today Magazine&quot;, Jack splices them together into a crude movie, syncs them with his recorded audio and finds a visible flash and smoke from the fired gun. Though initially reluctant, Sally eventually agrees to help Jack privately investigate the incident. Over a drink, Jack reveals how he left his prior career as part of a government commission to root out police corruption after a wiretap operation he was involved in led to the death of an undercover cop named Freddie Corso.

Unbeknownst to Jack, Sally and Karp, both frequent blackmail co-conspirators, were hired as part of a larger plot against McRyan. A rival candidate had hired a thug named Burke to hook McRyan with Sally posing as a prostitute, take unflattering pictures of the pair, and publish them to expedite McRyan&#x27;s withdrawal. However, Burke decided to blow out the tire of McRyan&#x27;s car with a gunshot, thereby causing the accident. After botching the cover-up of Sally by murdering a look-alike, Burke murders two more look-alike women with piano wire and attributes the deaths to a fictional serial killer, &quot;the Liberty Bell Strangler,&quot; so that he can cover up the cover-up when she is successfully murdered.

To help Jack investigate McRyan&#x27;s murder, Sally steals Karp&#x27;s film, which, when synced to Jack&#x27;s audio, clearly reveals the gunshot that precipitated the blow-out. Nevertheless, nobody believes Jack&#x27;s story and a seemingly widespread conspiracy immediately silences his every move. Local talk-show host Frank Donahue asks to interview Jack on air and release his tapes, to which Jack eventually agrees. Burke follows the development by tapping Jack&#x27;s phone, calls Sally as Donahue, and asks her to meet him at a train station with the tapes. When Sally tells Jack about Donahue&#x27;s call, he becomes suspicious. He copies the audio tapes, but is unable to copy the film before Sally&#x27;s meeting.

Shadowing a wired Sally from a distance, Jack is alarmed to see that his supposed contact is actually Burke. Immediately realizing that she is in danger, Jack attempts to warn her, but she and Burke slip out of range and into a parade. Jack manically dashes across the city, attempting to head them off and rescue her, but crashes his Jeep into the window of a department store and is incapacitated. By the time he awakens in a parked ambulance, Burke has stolen the film from Sally and thrown it into a river. Still listening in on his earpiece, Jack spots Burke attacking her on a rooftop, startles him and ultimately stabs him to death with his own weapon, but shockingly discovers that Sally has already been strangled, cradling her lifeless corpse in his arms.

Burke&#x27;s death, combined with the loss of the film, ties up the last loose end. Jack&#x27;s audio tapes alone are ultimately deemed insufficient to prove that a gunshot occurred and the cover-up succeeds. Jack begins replaying the recording of Sally&#x27;s voice, eventually becoming obsessed with it. Sometime later, he has incorporated her death scream in &quot;Co-ed Frenzy&quot;. Ecstatic at having found the perfect scream, Sam replays the audio, forcing Jack to cover his ears.

==Cast==
==Production==
After completing &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, De Palma was considering several projects, including &quot;Act of Vengeance&quot; (later produced for HBO starring Charles Bronson and Ellen Burstyn), &quot;Flashdance&quot;, and a script of his own titled &quot;Personal Effects&quot;. The story outline for the latter was similar to what would become &quot;Blow Out&quot;, but set in Canada.

According to screenwriter Bill Mesce Jr., he wrote the first draft of the script after winning a competition in Take One magazine hosted by Brian De Palma, but his version ended up being almost completely changed.

De Palma scripted and filmed &quot;Blow Out&quot; in his home town of Philadelphia. The film&#x27;s $18 million budget was high for De Palma, and Filmways spent an additional $9 million to market the film. De Palma considered Al Pacino for the role of Jack Terry, but ultimately chose John Travolta, who himself lobbied De Palma to cast Nancy Allen for the role of Sally Bedina (the three had previously worked together on &quot;Carrie&quot;); De Palma initially hesitated—he was married to Allen at the time, and did not want her to be known for only working in his pictures—but ultimately agreed. In addition to Travolta and Allen, De Palma filled the film&#x27;s cast and crew with a number of his previous collaborators: Dennis Franz (&quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, &quot;The Fury&quot;); John Lithgow (&quot;Obsession&quot;, &quot;Raising Cain&quot; in later years); cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond (&quot;Obsession&quot;); editor Paul Hirsch (&quot;Hi, Mom!&quot;, &quot;Sisters&quot;, &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;, &quot;Obsession&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;The Fury&quot;); and composer Pino Donaggio (&quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Home Movies&quot;, &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;).

Seventy percent of the film was shot at night. &quot;Basically I just shot &quot;Blow Out&quot; straight&quot;, replied cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, &quot;... By not diffusing and not flashing as much ... That doesn&#x27;t mean I necessarily like that look but I think it was good for the picture. You see, I like a softer look, a more diffused look.&quot; During the editing process, two reels of footage from the Liberty Parade sequence were stolen and never recovered. The scenes were reshot with insurance money at a cost of $750,000. Because Zsigmond was no longer available, László Kovács lensed the reshot sequences.

==Themes and allusions==
Thematically, &quot;Blow Out&quot; almost &quot;exclusively concern[s] the mechanics of movie making&quot; with a &quot;total, complete and utter preoccupation with film itself as a medium in which ... style really is content.&quot; In numerous scenes, the film depicts the interaction of sound and images, the manner in which the two are joined together, and methods in which they are re-edited, remixed, and rearranged to reveal new truths or the lack of any objective truth. The film uses several of De Palma&#x27;s trademark techniques: split screen, the split diopter lens, and the elaborate tracking shot.

As with several other De Palma films, &quot;Blow Out&quot; explores the power of guilt; both Jack and Sally are motivated to help right their past wrongs, both with tragic consequences. De Palma also revisits the theme of voyeurism, a recurring theme in much of his previous work (ex:, &quot;Hi, Mom!&quot;, &quot;Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;). Jack exhibits elements of a peeping tom, but one who works with sound instead of image.

&quot;Blow Out&quot; incorporates multiple allusions both to other films and to historical events. Its protagonist&#x27;s obsessive reconstruction of a sound recording to uncover a possible murder recalls both Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;Blowup&quot; and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot;. The film alludes to elements of the Watergate scandal and the JFK assassination. The film also recalls elements of the Chappaquiddick incident, although De Palma intentionally tried to downplay the similarities. The film references the Zapruder film as comparable to the footage shot of the accident.

De Palma also explicitly references two of his previous projects. At one point in the film, Dennis Franz watches De Palma&#x27;s film &quot;Murder a la Mod&quot; on television. Originally, the character was to watch Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Dementia 13&quot;, but Roger Corman demanded too much for the rights. A flashback where Travolta recalls an incident where his work got a police informant killed was also taken from an abandoned project, &quot;Prince of the City&quot;, which was ultimately directed by Sidney Lumet.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Blow Out&quot; opened on July 24, 1981, to positive reviews from critics, including several that were ecstatic. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pauline Kael gave the film one of her few unconditional raves:

De Palma has sprung to the place that Robert Altman achieved with films such as &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot; and that Francis Ford Coppola reached with &quot;The Godfather&quot; films—that is, to the place where genre is transcended and what we&#x27;re moved by is an artist&#x27;s vision ... it&#x27;s a great movie. Travolta and Allen are radiant performers.

Roger Ebert&#x27;s four-star review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted that &quot;Blow Out&quot; &quot;is inhabited by a real cinematic intelligence. The audience isn&#x27;t condescended to ... we share the excitement of figuring out how things develop and unfold, when so often the movies only need us as passive witnesses.&quot; Both Ebert and fellow critic Gene Siskel recommended it on its original run (and with the former putting it as part of his list of their &quot;Buried Treasures&quot; in a 1986 episode of &quot;At the Movies&quot;). Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 89% based on 61 reviews, with an average grade of 7.90/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;With a story inspired by Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; and a style informed by the high-gloss suspense of Hitchcock, De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Blow Out&quot; is raw, politically informed, and littered with film references&quot;.

Despite positive reviews, the film floundered at the box office, due to negative word of mouth about its bleak ending. &quot;Blow Out&quot; made $13,747,234 (or $ in ) at the box office. It was considered a disappointment, as Filmways had publicly claimed the film would make $60–80 million. Rentals generated $8 million.

However, the public reputation of &quot;Blow Out&quot; has grown considerably in the years following its release. As a &quot;movie about making movies&quot;, it has earned a natural audience with subsequent generations of cineastes. In particular, Quentin Tarantino has consistently praised the movie, listing it alongside &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; as one of his three favorite films. In homage, Tarantino used the music cue &quot;Sally and Jack&quot; from the score by Pino Donaggio within his own film &quot;Death Proof&quot;, the second half of the double release &quot;Grindhouse&quot;. Noel Murray and Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; put &quot;Blow Out&quot; at #1 of their list of De Palma&#x27;s best films (&quot;The Essentials&quot;), describing it as

The quintessential De Palma film, this study of a movie craftsman investigating a political cover-up marries suspense, sick humor, sexuality, and leftist cynicism into an endlessly reflective study of art imitating life imitating art.

In April 2011, the film became a part of the Criterion Collection with a DVD and Blu-ray release. Special features include new interviews with Brian De Palma and Nancy Allen. The Criterion release also includes De Palma&#x27;s first feature-length film &quot;Murder a la Mod&quot;.

In 2023, &quot;Time&quot; selected &quot;Blow Out&quot; as part of their list 100 Best Movies of the Past 10 Decades, praising it as &quot;a film filled with mistrust, one where the ghosts of Chappaquiddick and the Zapruder film lurk in the corners.&quot;

<doc id="1317988" wikidata="Q903229" url="?curid=1317988" title="Rhinoceros auklet">
<text>The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) is a seabird and a close relative of the puffins. It is the only extant species of the genus &quot;Cerorhinca&quot;. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name rhinoceros puffin has been proposed for the species.

It ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in colonies. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak (the anatomic term for this extension is the rhamphotheca). This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year. This horn also possesses fluorescent properties, which is likely involved in reproductive signalling.

The rhinoceros auklet (also known as the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the &#x27;horn&#x27; protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).

==Distribution==
The rhinoceros auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the Channel Islands) to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in North America; and Hokkaidō and Honshū, Japan, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin Island in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some migration. Between October and April, migration of a large number occurs on pelagic California waters, most coming from breeding colonies north of California. Auks that reside off the California coast remain in their areas.

==Breeding==
Breeding occurs in the early summer months, ranging from May to June. The auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 30–35 days. The semiprecocial chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 35–45 days. This nocturnal behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and kleptoparasitism by gulls.

Rhinoceros auklets are monogamous, and although they migrate across similar areas during the non-breeding season, pair-mates migrate separately. However, they do synchronize their foraging activity once they return to the colony during the pre-laying period.

==Feeding==
At sea, rhinoceros auklets feed on fish, with some krill and squid taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater. To catch their prey, they dive as deep as 57 meters (187 ft) for as long as 148 seconds.

Diet studies of nesting rhinoceros auklets show that their diet is variable depending on the location of the bird&#x27;s nest. At one island located near the Salish Sea off of the Washington coast, auklets feed mainly on sand lance, while at a separate island also off of the Washington coast, auklets feed on anchovy and smelt.

==Evolution and prehistoric species==
The genus &quot;Cerorhinca&quot; evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late Miocene. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as Baja California. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of &quot;Cerorhinca&quot; is more complex than previously thought. Known prehistoric species are:

* Dubious auklet, &quot;Cerorhinca dubia&quot; L. H. Miller, 1925 (Late Miocene of San Barbara County, USA)
* &quot;Cerorhinca minor&quot; Howard, 1971 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Cedros Island, Mexico)
* &quot;Cerorhinca reai&quot; Chandler, 1990 (San Diego Late Pliocene, North American Southwest)
* &quot;Cerorhinca aurorensis&quot; N. A. Smith, 2011, a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, only published in a PhD dissertation (Yorktown Formation Late Pliocene, North Carolina, USA)
* &quot;Cerorhinca&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene, Southeastern Woodlands)

=== Bill fluorescence ===
Since rhinoceros auklets are monogamous and highly social, the species depend heavily on physical characteristics of the other species in order to choose a lifetime mate. The prominent horn on the bill of breeding rhinoceros auklet is one evolutionary byproduct of this behavior. The bill has fluorescent characteristics when viewed under ultraviolet light. Several bird species are able to detect cues through UV light, which supports the claim that this fluorescence is also meant for breeding purposes. While the upper and lower mandible give off fluorescence as well, this phenomenon is most prominent in the horn. There is no evidence for disparity of fluorescence between sexes, however, the amount of fluorescence does vary between individual auks.

<text>The South Texas State Fair is an annual regional state fair held in Beaumont, Texas. The fair features a livestock show, a commercial exhibition, and a carnival Midway. Food concessions are a major attraction of the fair. Reflecting Beaumont&#x27;s location in Southeast Texas, normal carnival foods can be found alongside barbecue, Tex-Mex, and Cajun foods (often including fried alligator).

, the South Texas State Fair had an attendance of over 500,000 people, second in the state to the State Fair of Texas in Dallas. The fair is held annually in late March to early April.

Fair patrollers include security guards, the Beaumont, TX Police and Jefferson County, TX Sheriff.

== History ==
The South Texas State Fair traces its roots to the first confirmable fair in Beaumont, held in 1907. With the exception of cancellations in 1917–18, 1942–45, 2005, 2008 &amp; 2020 because of World War I, World War II, Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Ike &amp; COVID-19 pandemic respectively, the fair has continued every year since. It was first known as the Beaumont Fair, then the Southeast Texas State Fair, and in 1921 just the South Texas State Fair. In 1942, operation of the fair was transferred to the YMBL (Young Men&#x27;s Business League), a local non-profit civic improvement organization.

While other state fairs, including the larger State Fair of Texas, were closed for the duration of World War II, the South Texas State Fair continued as the &quot;YMBL Victory Fair&quot;. The YMBL states that this was in part on request from the US military as an attempt to improve morale of soldiers stationed in and near the Beaumont area.

After the war, the fair continued. In 2004, the South Texas State Fair moved from the Beaumont Fairgrounds on the east side of the city to Ford Park on I-10 on the west side.

The 2005 fair was cancelled due to the extensive damage that Hurricane Rita inflicted on the region; It returned in 2006. Due to Hurricane Ike and the hurricane relief staging centered in Ford Park, the 2008 fair was canceled.

The fair resumed in March 2009, marking a permanent schedule change from fall to spring. Reasons stated for the change included better weather, lack of competition from football, and a better fit for midway ride provider Bill Hames Shows.

And 2020 saw cancellation on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic, with next year being delayed to late May.

<doc id="1318008" wikidata="Q310802" url="?curid=1318008" title="Causes of World War I">
<text>The identification of the causes of World War I remains a debated issue. World War I began in the Balkans on July 28, 1914, and hostilities ended on November 11, 1918, leaving 17 million dead and 25 million wounded. Moreover, the Russian Civil War can in many ways be considered a continuation of World War I, as can various other conflicts in the direct aftermath of 1918.

Scholars looking at the long term seek to explain why two rival sets of powers (the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire against the Russian Empire, France, and the British Empire) came into conflict by the start of 1914. They look at such factors as political, territorial and economic competition; militarism, a complex web of alliances and alignments; imperialism, the growth of nationalism; and the power vacuum created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Other important long-term or structural factors that are often studied include unresolved territorial disputes, the perceived breakdown of the European balance of power, convoluted and fragmented governance, arms races and security dilemmas, a cult of the offensive, and military planning.

Scholars seeking short-term analysis focus on the summer of 1914 and ask whether the conflict could have been stopped, or instead whether deeper causes made it inevitable. Among the immediate causes were the decisions made by statesmen and generals during the July Crisis, which was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Bosnian Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip, who had been supported by a nationalist organization in Serbia. The crisis escalated as the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was joined by their allies Russia, Germany, France, and ultimately Belgium and the United Kingdom. Other factors that came into play during the diplomatic crisis leading up to the war included misperceptions of intent (such as the German belief that Britain would remain neutral), the fatalistic belief that war was inevitable, and the speed with which the crisis escalated, partly due to delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications.

The crisis followed a series of diplomatic clashes among the Great Powers (Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary and Russia) over European and colonial issues in the decades before 1914 that had left tensions high. And the cause of the public clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe that had been taking place since 1867.

Consensus on the origins of the war remains elusive, since historians disagree on key factors and place differing emphasis on a variety of factors. That is compounded by historical arguments changing over time, particularly as classified historical archives become available, and as perspectives and ideologies of historians have changed. The deepest division among historians is between those who see Germany and Austria-Hungary as having driven events and those who focus on power dynamics among a wider set of actors and circumstances. Secondary fault lines exist between those who believe that Germany deliberately planned a European war, those who believe that the war was largely unplanned but was still caused principally by Germany and Austria-Hungary taking risks, and those who believe that some or all of the other powers (Russia, France, Serbia, United Kingdom) played a more significant role in causing the war than has been traditionally suggested.

== Immediate causes ==

=== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian nationalists, 28 June 1914 ===
On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead after a wrong turn by two gun shots in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) co-ordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society.

The assassination was significant because it was perceived by Austria-Hungary as an existential challenge and so was viewed as providing a &quot;casus belli&quot; with Serbia. Emperor Franz Josef was eighty-four and so the assassination of his heir, so soon before he was likely to hand over the crown, was seen as a direct challenge to the empire. Many ministers in Austria, especially Berchtold, argued that the act must be avenged.

=== July Crisis ===
== Polarization of Europe, 1887–1914 ==
In August 1914, &quot;The Independent&quot; magazine described the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife in June as a &quot;deplorable but relatively insignificant&quot; reason for which.

&quot;It may be doubted whether the Archduke [is] worth all this carnage&quot;, the magazine added. It discussed and dismissed ethnicity, race, religion, and national interests as motivations for war. &quot;The Independent&quot; concluded that &quot;such is the ridiculous and tragical situation resulting from the survival of the antiquated superstition of the &#x27;balance of power,&#x27; that is, the theory that the prosperity of one nation was an injury to others&quot;:

&quot;The only unexpected thing about the present European war is the date of it&quot;, the magazine added later that month:

To understand the long-term origins of the war in 1914, it is essential to understand how the powers formed into two competing sets that shared common aims and enemies. Both sets became, by August 1914, Germany and Austria-Hungary on one side and Russia, France, and Britain on the other side.

=== German realignment to Austria-Hungary and Russian realignment to France, 1887–1892 ===
In 1887, German and Russian alignment was secured by means of a secret Reinsurance Treaty arranged by Otto von Bismarck. However, in 1890, Bismarck fell from power, and the treaty was allowed to lapse in favor of the Dual Alliance (1879) between Germany and Austria-Hungary. That development was attributed to Count Leo von Caprivi, the Prussian general who replaced Bismarck as chancellor. It is claimed that Caprivi recognized a personal inability to manage the European system as his predecessor had and so was counseled by contemporary figures such as Friedrich von Holstein to follow a more logical approach, as opposed to Bismarck&#x27;s complex and even duplicitous strategy. Thus, the treaty with Austria-Hungary was concluded despite the Russian willingness to amend the Reinsurance Treaty and to sacrifice a provision referred to as the &quot;very secret additions&quot; that concerned the Turkish Straits.

Caprivi&#x27;s decision was also driven by the belief that the Reinsurance Treaty was no longer needed to ensure Russian neutrality if France attacked Germany, and the treaty would even preclude an offensive against France. Lacking the capacity for Bismarck&#x27;s strategic ambiguity, Caprivi pursued a policy that was oriented towards &quot;getting Russia to accept Berlin&#x27;s promises on good faith and to encourage St. Petersburg to engage in a direct understanding with Vienna, without a written accord.&quot; By 1882, the Dual Alliance was expanded to include Italy. In response, Russia secured in the same year the Franco-Russian Alliance, a strong military relationship that was to last until 1917. That move was prompted by Russia&#x27;s need for an ally since it was experiencing a major famine and a rise in antigovernment revolutionary activities. The alliance was gradually built throughout the years from when Bismarck refused the sale of Russian bonds in Berlin, which drove Russia to the Paris capital market. That began the expansion of Russian and French financial ties, which eventually helped elevate the Franco-Russian entente to the diplomatic and military arenas.

Caprivi&#x27;s strategy appeared to work when, during the outbreak of the Bosnian crisis of 1908, Germany successfully demanded that Russia step back and demobilize. When Germany asked Russia the same thing later, Russia refused, which finally helped precipitate the war.

=== French distrust of Germany ===

Some of the distant origins of World War I can be seen in the results and consequences of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871 and the concurrent unification of Germany. Germany had won decisively and established a powerful empire, but France fell into chaos and experienced a years-long decline in its military power. A legacy of animosity grew between France and Germany after the German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. The annexation caused widespread resentment in France, giving rise to the desire for revenge that was known as revanchism. French sentiment was based on a desire to avenge military and territorial losses and the displacement of France as the pre-eminent continental military power. Bismarck was wary of the French desire for revenge and achieved peace by isolating France and by balancing the ambitions of Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. During his later years, he tried to placate the French by encouraging their overseas expansion. However, anti-German sentiment remained.

France eventually recovered from its defeat, paid its war indemnity, and rebuilt its military strength. However, France was smaller than Germany in terms of population and industry and therefore many French felt insecure next to a more powerful neighbor. By the 1890s, the desire for revenge over Alsace-Lorraine was no longer a major factor for the leaders of France but remained a force in public opinion. Jules Cambon, the French ambassador to Berlin (1907–1914), worked hard to secure a détente, but the French government realized that Berlin was trying to weaken the Triple Entente and at the best, was not sincere in seeking peace. The French consensus was that war was inevitable.

=== British alignment towards France and Russia, 1898–1907: The Triple Entente ===

After Bismarck&#x27;s removal in 1890, French efforts to isolate Germany became successful. With the formation of the informal Triple Entente, Germany began to feel encircled. French Foreign Minister Théophile Delcassé went to great pains to woo Russia and Britain. Key markers were the 1894 Franco-Russian Alliance, the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain, and the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention, which led to the Triple Entente. France&#x27;s informal alignment with Britain and its formal alliance with Russia against Germany and Austria eventually led Russia and Britain to enter World War I as France&#x27;s allies.

Britain abandoned its policy of splendid isolation in the 1900s, after it had been isolated during the Second Boer War. Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with its two major colonial rivals: the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907. Some historians see Britain&#x27;s alignment as principally a reaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the buildup of its navy from 1898 that led to the Anglo-German naval arms race.

Other scholars, most notably Niall Ferguson, argue that Britain chose France and Russia over Germany because Germany was too weak an ally to provide an effective counterbalance to the other powers and could not provide Britain with the imperial security that was achieved by the Entente agreements. In the words of the British diplomat Arthur Nicolson, it was &quot;far more disadvantageous to us to have an unfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany.&quot; Ferguson argues that the British government rejected German alliance overtures &quot;not because Germany began to pose a threat to Britain, but, on the contrary because they realized she did not pose a threat.&quot; The impact of the Triple Entente was therefore twofold by improving British relations with France and its ally, Russia, and showing the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany. It was &quot;not that antagonism toward Germany caused its isolation, but rather that the new system itself channeled and intensified hostility towards the German Empire.&quot;

The Triple Entente between Britain, France, and Russia is often compared to the Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against that comparison as simplistic. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence, and so in 1914 Britain felt free to make its own foreign policy decisions. As the British Foreign Office official Eyre Crowe minuted: &quot;The fundamental fact of course is that the &quot;Entente&quot; is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the &quot;Entente&quot; is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content.&quot;

A series of diplomatic incidents between 1905 and 1914 heightened tensions between the Great Powers and reinforced the existing alignments, beginning with the First Moroccan Crisis.

=== First Moroccan Crisis, 1905–06: Strengthening the Entente ===

The First Moroccan Crisis was an international dispute between March 1905 and May 1906 over the status of Morocco. The crisis worsened German relations with both France and Britain, and helped ensure the success of the new Entente Cordiale. In the words of the historian Christopher Clark, &quot;The Anglo-French Entente was strengthened rather than weakened by the German challenge to France in Morocco.&quot; Due to this crisis, Spain turned to the United Kingdom and France, and signed the Pact of Cartagena of 1907. Spain received British help to build the new España-class battleship.

=== Bosnian Crisis, 1908: Worsening relations of Russia and Serbia with Austria-Hungary ===
In 1908, Austria-Hungary announced its annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, provinces in the Balkans. Bosnia and Herzegovina had been nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire but administered by Austria-Hungary since the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The announcement upset the fragile balance of power in the Balkans and enraged Serbia and pan-Slavic nationalists throughout Europe. The weakened Russia was forced to submit to its humiliation, but its foreign office still viewed Austria-Hungary&#x27;s actions as overly aggressive and threatening. Russia&#x27;s response was to encourage pro-Russian and anti-Austrian sentiment in Serbia and other Balkan provinces, provoking Austrian fears of Slavic expansionism in the region.

===Agadir crisis in Morocco, 1911===

Imperial rivalries pushed France, Germany, and Britain to compete for control of Morocco, leading to a short-lived war scare in 1911. In the end, France established a protectorate over Morocco that increased European tensions. The Agadir Crisis resulted from the deployment of a substantial force of French troops into the interior of Morocco in April 1911. Germany reacted by sending the gunboat to the Moroccan port of Agadir on 1 July 1911. The main result was deeper suspicion between London and Berlin and closer military ties between London and Paris.

British backing of France during the crisis reinforced the Entente between the two countries and with Russia, increased Anglo-German estrangement, and deepened the divisions that would erupt in 1914. In terms of internal British jousting, the crisis was part of a five-year struggle inside the British cabinet between Radical isolationists and the Liberal Party&#x27;s imperialist interventionists. The interventionists sought to use the Triple Entente to contain German expansion. The Radical isolationists obtained an agreement for official cabinet approval of all initiatives that might lead to war. However, the interventionists were joined by the two leading Radicals, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. Lloyd George&#x27;s famous Mansion House speech of 21 July 1911 angered the Germans and encouraged the French.

The crisis led British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey, a Liberal, and French leaders to make a secret naval agreement by which the Royal Navy would protect the northern coast of France from German attack, and France agreed to concentrate the French Navy in the western Mediterranean and to protect British interests there. France was thus able to guard its communications with its North African colonies, and Britain to concentrate more force in home waters to oppose the German High Seas Fleet. The British cabinet was not informed of the agreement until August 1914. Meanwhile, the episode strengthened the hand of German Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, who was calling for a greatly-increased navy and obtained it in 1912.

The American historian Raymond James Sontag argues that Agadir was a comedy of errors that became a tragic prelude to the World War I:

The crisis seems comic—its obscure origin, the questions at stake, the conduct of the actors—all comic. The results were tragic. Tension between France and Germany and between Germany and England have been increased; the armaments race receive new impetus; the conviction that an early war was inevitable spread through the governing class of Europe.

=== Italo-Turkish War: Isolation of the Ottomans, 1911–1912 ===

In the Italo-Turkish War, the Kingdom of Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in North Africa in 1911–1912. Italy easily captured the important coastal cities, but its army failed to advance far into the interior. Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet, a province whose most notable subprovinces, or sanjaks, were Fezzan, Cyrenaica, and Tripoli itself. The territories together formed what was later known as Italian Libya. The main significance for World War I was that it was now clear that no Great Power still appeared to wish to support the Ottoman Empire, which paved the way for the Balkan Wars. Christopher Clark stated, &quot;Italy launched a war of conquest on an African province of the Ottoman Empire, triggering a chain of opportunistic assaults on Ottoman territories across the Balkans. The system of geographical balances that had enabled local conflicts to be contained was swept away.&quot;

=== Balkan Wars, 1912–13: Growth of Serbian and Russian power ===

The Balkan Wars were two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of them, Bulgaria, was defeated in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, was weakened, as a much-enlarged Kingdom of Serbia pushed for union of all South Slavs.

The Balkan Wars in 1912–1913 increased international tension between Russia and Austria-Hungary. It also led to a strengthening of Serbia and a weakening of the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, which might otherwise have kept Serbia under control, thus disrupting the balance of power in Europe toward Russia.

Russia initially agreed to avoid territorial changes, but later in 1912, it supported Serbia&#x27;s demand for an Albanian port. The London Conference of 1912–13 agreed to create an independent Albania, but both Serbia and Montenegro refused to comply. After an Austrian and then an international naval demonstration in early 1912 and Russia&#x27;s withdrawal of support, Serbia backed down. Montenegro was not as compliant, and on May 2, the Austrian council of ministers met and decided to give Montenegro a last chance to comply, or it would resort to military action. However, seeing the Austro-Hungarian military preparations, the Montenegrins requested for the ultimatum to be delayed, and they complied.
The Serbian government, having failed to get Albania, now demanded for the other spoils of the First Balkan War to be reapportioned, and Russia failed to pressure Serbia to back down. Serbia and Greece allied against Bulgaria, which responded with a pre-emptive strike against their forces and so began the Second Balkan War. The Bulgarian army crumbled quickly after the Ottoman Empire and Romania joined the war.

The Balkan Wars strained the German alliance with Austria-Hungary. The attitude of the German government to Austro-Hungarian requests of support against Serbia was initially divided and inconsistent. After the German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912, it was clear that Germany was not ready to support Austria-Hungary in a war against Serbia and its likely allies.

In addition, German diplomacy before, during, and after the Second Balkan War was pro-Greek and pro-Romanian and against Austria-Hungary&#x27;s increasing pro-Bulgarian sympathies. The result was tremendous damage to relations between both empires. Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Leopold von Berchtold remarked to the German ambassador, Heinrich von Tschirschky in July 1913, &quot;Austria-Hungary might as well belong &#x27;to the other grouping&#x27; for all the good Berlin had been.&quot;

In September 1913, it was learned that Serbia was moving into Albania, and Russia was doing nothing to restrain it, and the Serbian government would not guarantee to respect Albania&#x27;s territorial integrity and suggested that some frontier modifications would occur. In October 1913, the council of ministers decided to send Serbia a warning followed by an ultimatum for Germany and Italy to be notified of some action and asked for support and for spies to be sent to report if there was an actual withdrawal. Serbia responded to the warning with defiance, and the ultimatum was dispatched on October 17 and received the following day. It demanded for Serbia to evacuate from Albania within eight days. After Serbia complied, the Kaiser made a congratulatory visit to Vienna to try to fix some of the damage done earlier in the year.

By then, Russia had mostly recovered from its defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, and the calculations of Germany and Austria were driven by a fear that Russia would eventually become too strong to be challenged. The conclusion was that any war with Russia had to occur within the next few years to have any chance of success.

=== Franco-Russian Alliance changes to Balkan inception scenario, 1911–1913 ===
The original Franco-Russian alliance was formed to protect both France and Russia from a German attack. In the event of such an attack, both states would mobilize in tandem, placing Germany under the threat of a two-front war. However, there were limits placed on the alliance so that it was essentially defensive in character.

Throughout the 1890s and the 1900s, the French and the Russians made clear the limits of the alliance did not extend to provocations caused by each other&#x27;s adventurous foreign policy. For example, Russia warned France that the alliance would not operate if the French provoked the Germans in North Africa. Equally, the French insisted that the Russians should not use the alliance to provoke Austria-Hungary or Germany in the Balkans and that France did not recognize in the Balkans a vital strategic interest for France or Russia.

That changed in the last 18 to 24 months before the outbreak of the war. At the end of 1911, particularly during the Balkan Wars in 1912–1913, the French view changed to accept the importance of the Balkans to Russia. Moreover, France clearly stated that if, as a result of a conflict in the Balkans, war broke out between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, France would stand by Russia. Thus, the alliance changed in character and Serbia now became a security salient for Russia and France. A war of Balkan inception, regardless of who started such a war, would cause the alliance to respond by viewing the conflict as a &quot;casus foederis&quot;, a trigger for the alliance. Christopher Clark described that change as &quot;a very important development in the pre-war system which made the events of 1914 possible.&quot;
Otte also agrees that France became significantly less keen on restraining Russia after the Austro-Serbian crisis of 1912, and sought to embolden Russia against Austria. The Russian ambassador conveyed Poincare&#x27;s message as saying that &quot;if Russia wages war, France also wages war.&quot;

===Liman von Sanders Affair: 1913-14===
This was a crisis caused by the appointment of an Imperial German Army officer, Otto Liman von Sanders, to command the Ottoman First Army Corps guarding Constantinople and the subsequent Russian objections. In November, 1913, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov complained to Berlin that the Sanders mission was an &quot;openly hostile act.&quot; In addition to threatening Russia&#x27;s foreign trade, half of which flowed through the Turkish Straits, the mission raised the possibility of a German-led Ottoman assault on Russia&#x27;s Black Sea ports, and it imperiled Russian plans for expansion in eastern Anatolia. A compromise arrangement was agreed for Sanders to be appointed to the rather less senior and less influential position of Inspector General in January 1914. When the war came Sanders provided only limited help to the Ottoman forces.

=== Anglo-German détente, 1912–14 ===

Historians have cautioned that taken together, the preceding crises should not be seen as an argument that a European war was inevitable in 1914.

Although the Haldane Mission of February 1912 failed to halt the Anglo-German naval arms race, the race suddenly paused in late 1912 as Germany cut its naval budget. In April 1913, Britain and Germany signed an agreement over the African territories of the Portuguese Empire, which was expected to collapse imminently. (That empire lasted into the 1970s.) Moreover, the Russians were again threatening British interests in Persia and India. The British were &quot;deeply annoyed by St Petersburg&#x27;s failure to observe the terms of the agreement struck in 1907 and began to feel an arrangement of some kind with Germany might serve as a useful corrective.&quot; Despite the infamous 1908 interview in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, which implied that Kaiser Wilhelm wanted war, he came to be regarded as a guardian of peace. After the Moroccan Crisis, in the Anglo-German press wars, previously an important feature of international politics during the first decade of the century, virtually ceased. In early 1913, H. H. Asquith stated, &quot;Public opinion in both countries seems to point to an intimate and friendly understanding.&quot; The end of the naval arms race, the relaxation of colonial rivalries, and the increased diplomatic co-operation in the Balkans all resulted in an improvement in Germany&#x27;s image in Britain by the eve of the war.

The British diplomat Arthur Nicolson wrote in May 1914, &quot;Since I have been at the Foreign Office I have not seen such calm waters.&quot; The Anglophile German Ambassador Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky, deplored that Germany had acted hastily without waiting for the British offer of mediation in July 1914 to be given a chance.

== Domestic political factors ==
=== German domestic politics ===

Left-wing parties, especially the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), made large gains in the 1912 German federal election. The German government was still dominated by the Prussian Junkers, who feared the rise of left-wing parties. Fritz Fischer famously argued that the Junker class deliberately sought an external war to distract the population and to whip up patriotic support for the government. Indeed, one German military leader, Moritz von Lynker, the chief of the military cabinet, wanted war in 1909 because it was &quot;desirable in order to escape from difficulties at home and abroad.&quot; The Conservative Party leader Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa suggested that &quot;a war would strengthen patriarchal order.&quot;

Other authors argue that German conservatives were ambivalent about a war for fear that losing a war would have disastrous consequences and believed that even a successful war might alienate the population if it was lengthy or difficult. Many German people complained of a need to conform to the euphoria around them, which allowed later Nazi propagandists to &quot;foster an image of national fulfillment later destroyed by wartime betrayal and subversion culminating in the alleged &quot;Dolchstoss&quot; (stab in the back) of the army by socialists.&quot;

However, David G. Williamson believes that despite the ambivalence felt among some in the German Empire in its main land in Europe, especially certain actors in the labor movement, the spirit of 1914 was widely shared enough among all social classes to prove that the Empire was the primary cause of World War I.

===Drivers of Austro-Hungarian policy===

The argument that Austria-Hungary was a moribund political entity, whose disappearance was only a matter of time, was deployed by hostile contemporaries to suggest that its efforts to defend its integrity during the last years before the war were, in some sense, illegitimate.

Clark states, &quot;Evaluating the prospects of the Austro-Hungarian empire on the eve of the first world war confronts us in an acute way with the problem of temporal perspective... The collapse of the empire amid war and defeat in 1918 impressed itself upon the retrospective view of the Habsburg lands, overshadowing the scene with auguries of imminent and ineluctable decline.&quot;

It is true that Austro-Hungarian politics in the decades before the war were increasingly dominated by the struggle for national rights among the empire&#x27;s eleven official nationalities: Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ruthenians (Ukrainians), Poles, and Italians. However, before 1914, radical nationalists seeking full separation from the empire were still a small minority, and Austria-Hungary&#x27;s political turbulence was more noisy than deep.

In fact, in the decade before the war, the Habsburg lands passed through a phase of strong, widely-shared economic growth. Most inhabitants associated the Habsburgs with the benefits of orderly government, public education, welfare, sanitation, the rule of law, and the maintenance of a sophisticated infrastructure.

Christopher Clark states: &quot;Prosperous and relatively well administered, the empire, like its elderly sovereign, exhibited a curious stability amid turmoil. Crises came and went without appearing to threaten the existence of the system as such. The situation was always, as the Viennese journalist Karl Kraus quipped, &#x27;desperate but not serious&#x27;.&quot;

Jack Levy and William Mulligan argue that the death of Franz Ferdinand itself was a significant factor in helping escalate the July Crisis into a war by killing a powerful proponent for peace and thus encouraged a more belligerent decision-making process.

===Drivers of Serbian policy===
The principal aims of Serbian policy were to consolidate the Russian-backed expansion of Serbia in the Balkan Wars and to achieve dreams of a Greater Serbia, which included the unification of lands with large ethnic Serb populations in Austria-Hungary, including Bosnia 

Underlying that was a culture of extreme nationalism and a cult of assassination, which romanticized the slaying of the Ottoman Sultan Murad I as the heroic epilogue to the otherwise-disastrous Battle of Kosovo on 28 June 1389. Clark states: &quot;The Greater Serbian vision was not just a question of government policy, however, or even of propaganda. It was woven deeply into the culture and identity of the Serbs.&quot; Famed Serbian-American scientist Michael Pupin, for example, in July 1914 explicitly connected the Battle of Kosovo (&quot;a natural heritage of every true Serb&quot;) to Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination. He wrote that the battle&#x27;s &quot;memory always served as a reminder to the Serbs that they must avenge the wrongs perpetrated upon their race&quot;.

Serbian policy was complicated by the fact that the main actors in 1914 were both the official Serb government, led by Nikola Pašić, and the &quot;Black Hand&quot; terrorists, led by the head of Serb military intelligence, known as Apis. The Black Hand believed that a Greater Serbia would be achieved by provoking a war with Austria-Hungary by an act of terror. The war would be won with Russian backing.

The official government position was to focus on consolidating the gains made during the exhausting Balkan War and to avoid further conflicts. That official policy was temporized by the political necessity of simultaneously and clandestinely supporting dreams of a Greater Serbian state in the long term. The Serbian government found it impossible to put an end to the machinations of the Black Hand for fear it would itself be overthrown. Clark states: &quot;Serbian authorities were partly unwilling and partly unable to suppress the irredentist activity that had given rise to the assassinations in the first place&quot;.

Russia tended to support Serbia as a fellow Slavic state, considered Serbia its &quot;client,&quot; and encouraged Serbia to focus its irredentism against Austria-Hungary because it would discourage conflict between Serbia and Bulgaria, another prospective Russian ally, in Macedonia.

== Imperialism ==
===Impact of colonial rivalry and aggression on Europe in 1914===
Imperial rivalry and the consequences of the search for imperial security or for imperial expansion had important consequences for the origins of World War I.

Imperial rivalries between France, Britain, Russia and Germany played an important part in the creation of the Triple Entente and the relative isolation of Germany. Imperial opportunism, in the form of the Italian attack on Ottoman Libyan provinces, also encouraged the Balkan wars of 1912–13, which changed the balance of power in the Balkans to the detriment of Austria-Hungary.

Some historians, such as Margaret MacMillan, believe that Germany created its own diplomatic isolation in Europe, in part by an aggressive and pointless imperial policy known as Weltpolitik. Others, such as Clark, believe that German isolation was the unintended consequence of a détente between Britain, France, and Russia. The détente was driven by Britain&#x27;s desire for imperial security in relation to France in North Africa and to Russia in Persia and India.

Either way, the isolation was important because it left Germany few options but to ally itself more strongly with Austria-Hungary, leading ultimately to unconditional support for Austria-Hungary&#x27;s punitive war on Serbia during the July Crisis.

===German isolation: The potential consequences of Weltpolitik===

Otto von Bismarck disliked the idea of an overseas empire but supported France&#x27;s colonization in Africa because it diverted the French government, attention, and resources away from Continental Europe and revanchism after 1870. Germany&#x27;s &quot;New Course&quot; in foreign affairs, &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; (&quot;world policy&quot;), was adopted in the 1890s after Bismarck&#x27;s dismissal.

Its aim was ostensibly to transform Germany into a global power through assertive diplomacy, the acquisition of overseas colonies, and the development of a large navy.

Some historians, notably MacMillan and Hew Strachan, believe that a consequence of the policy of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; and Germany&#x27;s associated assertiveness was to isolate it. &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, particularly as expressed in Germany&#x27;s objections to France&#x27;s growing influence in Morocco in 1904 and 1907, also helped cement the Triple Entente. The Anglo-German naval race also isolated Germany by reinforcing Britain&#x27;s preference for agreements with Germany&#x27;s continental rivals: France and Russia.

===German isolation: The potential consequences of the Triple Entente===
Historians like Ferguson and Clark believe that Germany&#x27;s isolation was the unintended consequences of the need for Britain to defend its empire against threats from France and Russia. They also downplay the impact of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; and the Anglo-German naval race, which ended in 1911.

Britain and France signed a series of agreements in 1904, which became known as the Entente Cordiale. Most importantly, it granted freedom of action to Britain in Egypt and to France in Morocco. Equally, the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention greatly improved British–Russian relations by solidifying boundaries that identified respective control in Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet.

The alignment between Britain, France, and Russia became known as the Triple Entente. However, the Triple Entente was not conceived as a counterweight to the Triple Alliance but as a formula to secure imperial security among the three powers. The impact of the Triple Entente was twofold: improving British relations with France and its ally, Russia, and showing the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany. Clark states it was &quot;not that antagonism toward Germany caused its isolation, but rather that the new system itself channeled and intensified hostility towards the German Empire.&quot;

===Imperial opportunism===
The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 was fought between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Italy in North Africa. The war made it clear that no great power still appeared to wish to support the Ottoman Empire, which paved the way for the Balkan Wars.

The status of Morocco had been guaranteed by international agreement, and when France attempted a great expansion of its influence there without the assent of all other signatories, Germany opposed and prompted the Moroccan Crises: the Tangier Crisis of 1905 and the Agadir Crisis of 1911. The intent of German policy was to drive a wedge between the British and French, but in both cases, it produced the opposite effect and Germany was isolated diplomatically, most notably by lacking the support of Italy despite it being in the Triple Alliance. The French protectorate over Morocco was established officially in 1912.

In 1914, however, the African scene was peaceful. The continent was almost fully divided up by the imperial powers, with only Liberia and Ethiopia still independent. There were no major disputes there pitting any two European powers against each other.

=== Role of businesses and financial institutions ===

==== Lenin&#x27;s interpretation ====
Marxism attributes war to economic interests and rivalries, in this case, imperialism. Vladimir Lenin argued that &quot;imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism,&quot; which emerges from the &quot;free competition&quot; stage of capitalism and is characterized by the presence of &quot;five basic features&quot;:&quot;(1) the concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic life; (2) the merging of bank capital with industrial capital, and the creation, on the basis of this &#x27;finance capital,&#x27; of a financial oligarchy; (3) the export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires exceptional importance; (4) the formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the world among themselves and (5) the territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed.&quot;Lenin concluded that these five features of imperialism had been established by the turn of the 20th century, after the great powers had spent the final decades of the prior century acquiring nearly all the remaining territory of the world that had not yet been colonized. The largest and most lucrative uncolonized or semi-colonized territories at the time of the war were that of Persia (Iran), Turkey (including all of the pre-industrial territories of the declining Ottoman Empire), and most of China beyond the treaty ports. Having completed the division of the world among themselves at the beginning of the century, the developed capitalist states would thereafter compete for hegemony in the form of a &quot;redivision&quot; of those territories, both in the industrialized areas (e.g., &quot;German appetite for Belgium; French appetite for Lorraine&quot;), and in primarily agrarian areas.

==== Other views ====
Richard Hamilton observed that the argument went that since industrialists and bankers were seeking raw materials, new markets and new investments overseas, if one was strategically blocked by other powers, the &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;necessary&quot; solution was war. Hamilton somewhat criticized the view that the war was launched to secure colonies, but agreed that imperialism may have been on the mind of key decision makers. He argued that it was not necessarily for logical, economic reasons. Hamilton noted that Bismarck was famously not moved by such peer pressure and ended Germany&#x27;s limited imperialist movement. He regarded colonial ambitions as a waste of money but simultaneously recommended them to other nations.

While some bankers and industrialists tried to curb Wilhelm II away from war, their efforts ended in failure. There is no evidence they ever received a direct response from the Kaiser, chancellor, or foreign secretary or that their advice was discussed in depth by the Foreign Office or the General Staff. The German leadership measured power not in financial ledgers but land and military might.

Hamilton argued that, generally speaking, the European business leaders were in favour of profits and peace allowed for stability and investment opportunities across national borders, but war brought the disruption trade, the confiscation of holdings, and the risk of increased taxation. While arms manufacturers could make money selling weapons at home, they could also lose access to foreign markets. Krupp, a major arms manufacturer, started the war with 48 million marks in profits but ended it 148 million marks in debt, and the first year of peace saw further losses of 36 million marks.

William Mulligan argues that while economic and political factors were often interdependent, economic factors tended towards peace. Prewar trade wars and financial rivalries never threatened to escalate into conflict. Governments would mobilise bankers and financiers to serve their interests, rather than the reverse. The commercial and financial elite recognized peace as necessary for economic development and used its influence to resolve diplomatic crises. Economic rivalries existed but were framed largely by political concerns. Prior to the war, there were few signs that the international economy stood for war in the summer of 1914.

== Social Darwinism ==

Social Darwinism was a theory of human evolution loosely based on Darwinism that influenced many European intellectuals and strategic thinkers from 1870 to 1914. It emphasised that struggle between nations and races was natural and that only the fittest nations deserved to survive. It gave an impetus to German assertiveness as a world economic and military power, aimed at competing with France and Britain for world power. German colonial rule in Africa in 1884 to 1914 was an expression of nationalism and moral superiority, which was justified by constructing an image of the natives as &quot;Other.&quot; The approach highlighted racist views of mankind. German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;civilisation.&quot; Germany&#x27;s cultural-missionary project boasted that its colonial programmes were humanitarian and educational endeavours. Furthermore, the wide acceptance of Social Darwinism by intellectuals justified Germany&#x27;s right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; according to the historian Michael Schubert.

The model suggested an explanation of why some ethnic groups, then called &quot;races,&quot; had been for so long antagonistic, such as Germans and Slavs. They were natural rivals, destined to clash. Senior German generals like Helmuth von Moltke the Younger talked in apocalyptic terms about the need for Germans to fight for their existence as a people and culture. MacMillan states: &quot;Reflecting the Social Darwinist theories of the era, many Germans saw Slavs, especially Russia, as the natural opponent of the Teutonic races.&quot; Also, the chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff declared: &quot;A people that lays down its weapons seals its fate.&quot; In July 1914, the Austrian press described Serbia and the South Slavs in terms that owed much to Social Darwinism. In 1914, the German economist Johann Plenge described the war as a clash between the German &quot;ideas of 1914&quot; (duty, order, justice) and the French &quot;ideas of 1789&quot; (liberty, equality, fraternity). William Mulligen argues that Anglo-German antagonism was also about a clash of two political cultures as well as more traditional geopolitical and military concerns. Britain admired Germany for its economic successes and social welfare provision but also regarded Germany as illiberal, militaristic, and technocratic.

War was seen as a natural and viable or even useful instrument of policy. &quot;War was compared to a tonic for a sick patient or a life-saving operation to cut out diseased flesh.&quot; Since war was natural for some leaders, it was simply a question of timing and so it would be better to have a war when the circumstances were most propitious. &quot;I consider a war inevitable,&quot; declared Moltke in 1912. &quot;The sooner the better.&quot; In German ruling circles, war was viewed as the only way to rejuvenate Germany. Russia was viewed as growing stronger every day, and it was believed that Germany had to strike while it still could before it was crushed by Russia.

Nationalism made war a competition between peoples, nations or races, rather than kings and elites. Social Darwinism carried a sense of inevitability to conflict and downplayed the use of diplomacy or international agreements to end warfare. It tended to glorify warfare, the taking of initiative, and the warrior male role.

Social Darwinism played an important role across Europe, but J. Leslie has argued that it played a critical and immediate role in the strategic thinking of some important hawkish members of the Austro-Hungarian government. Social Darwinism, therefore, normalized war as an instrument of policy and justified its use.

== Arms race ==
By the 1870s to 1880s, all the major powers were preparing for a large-scale war - although none expected one. Britain neglected its small army but focused on building up the Royal Navy, which was already stronger than the next two largest navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy, Russia, and some smaller countries set up conscription systems in which young men would serve from one to three years in the army and then spend the next twenty years or so in the reserves, with annual summer training. Men with higher social status became officers. Each country devised a mobilization system to call up reserves quickly and send them to key points by rail.

Every year, general staffs updated and expanded their plans in terms of complexity. Each country stockpiled arms and supplies for an army that ran into the millions. Germany in 1874 had a regular professional army of 420,000 with an additional 1.3 million reserves. By 1897, the regular army was 545,000 strong and the reserves 3.4 million. The French in 1897 had 3.4 million reservists, Austria 2.6 million, and Russia 4.0 million. The size of military manpower increased: conscription-law changes in France in 1913, for example, boosted numbers in the French military on the eve of conflict.
The various national war-plans had been perfected by 1914, but with Russia and Austria trailing in effectiveness. Recent wars since 1865 had typically been short: a matter of months. All war-plans called for a decisive opening and assumed victory would come after a short war. None planned for the food and munitions needs of the long stalemate that actually unfolded from 1914 to 1918.

As David Stevenson puts it, &quot;A self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness... was an essential element in the conjuncture that led to disaster... The armaments race... was a necessary precondition for the outbreak of hostilities.&quot; David Herrmann goes further by arguing that the fear that &quot;windows of opportunity for victorious wars&quot; were closing, meaning that &quot;the arms race did precipitate the First World War&quot;. If the assassination of Franz Ferdinand had occurred in 1904 or even in 1911, Herrmann speculates, there might have been no war. It was &quot;the armaments race and the speculation about imminent or preventive wars&quot; that made his death in 1914 the trigger for war.

One of the aims of the First Hague Conference of 1899, held at the suggestion of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, was to discuss disarmament. The Second Hague Conference took place in 1907. All signatories except for Germany supported disarmament. Germany also did not want to agree to binding arbitration and mediation. The Kaiser was concerned that the United States would propose disarmament measures, which he opposed. All parties tried to revise international law to their own advantage.

=== Anglo-German naval race ===
Historians have debated the role of the German naval buildup as the principal cause of deteriorating Anglo-German relations. In any case, Germany never came close to catching up with Britain.

Supported by Wilhelm II&#x27;s enthusiasm for an expanded German navy, Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz championed four Fleet Acts from 1898 to 1912. From 1902 to 1910, Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy embarked on its own massive expansion to keep ahead of the Germans. The competition came to focus on the revolutionary new ships based on the design of &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, which was launched in 1906 and gave Britain a battleship that far outclassed any other in Europe.

The overwhelming British response proved to Germany that its efforts were unlikely ever to equal those of the Royal Navy. In 1900, the British had a 3.7:1 tonnage advantage over Germany; in 1910, the ratio was 2.3:1 and in 1914, it reached 2.1:1. Ferguson argues: &quot;So decisive was the British victory in the naval arms race that it is hard to regard it as in any meaningful sense a cause of the First World War.&quot; However, the had narrowed the gap by nearly half and that the Royal Navy had had a long-standing policy of surpassing any two potential opponents combined. The US Navy was in a period of growth, which made the German gains seem very ominous in London.

In Britain in 1913, there was intense internal debate about new ships because of the growing influence of Admiral John Fisher&#x27;s ideas and increasing financial constraints. In 1914, Germany adopted a policy of building submarines, instead of new dreadnoughts and destroyers, effectively abandoning the naval arms-race, but Berlin kept the new policy secret to delay other powers from following suit.

=== Russian interests in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire ===
Major Russian goals included strengthening Saint Petersburg&#x27;s role as the protector of Eastern Christians in the Balkans, such as in Serbia. Although Russia enjoyed a booming economy, growing population, and large armed forces, its strategic position was threatened by an expanding Ottoman military - trained by German experts and using the latest technology. The start of the war re-focussed attention on old Russian goals: expelling the Ottomans from Constantinople, extending Russian dominion into eastern Anatolia and Persian Azerbaijan, and annexing Galicia. Conquest of the Straits would have assured Russian predominance in the Black Sea and Russian access to the Mediterranean.

== Technical and military factors ==
===Short-war illusion===
Traditional narratives of the war suggested that when the war began, both sides believed that the war would end quickly. Rhetorically speaking, there was an expectation that the war would be &quot;over by Christmas&quot; in 1914. That is important for the origins of the conflict since it suggests that since it was expected that the war would be short, statesmen tended not to take gravity of military action as seriously as they might have done so otherwise. Modern historians suggest a nuanced approach. There is ample evidence to suggest that statesmen and military leaders thought the war would be lengthy and terrible and have profound political consequences.

While it is true all military leaders planned for a swift victory, many military and civilian leaders recognized that the war might be long and highly destructive. The principal German and French military leaders, including Moltke, Ludendorff, and Joffre, expected a long war. British Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener expected a long war: &quot;three years&quot; or longer, he told an amazed colleague.

Moltke hoped that if a European war broke out, it would be resolved swiftly, but he also conceded that it might drag on for years, wreaking immeasurable ruin. Asquith wrote of the approach of &quot;Armageddon&quot; and French and Russian generals spoke of a &quot;war of extermination&quot; and the &quot;end of civilization.&quot; British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey famously stated just hours before Britain declared war, &quot;The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.&quot;

Clark concluded, &quot;In the minds of many statesmen, the hope for a short war and the fear of a long one seemed to have cancelled each other out, holding at bay a fuller appreciation of the risks.&quot;

=== Primacy of offensive and war by timetable ===

Moltke, Joffre, Conrad, and other military commanders held that seizing the initiative was extremely important. That theory encouraged all belligerents to devise war plans to strike first to gain the advantage. The war plans all included complex plans for mobilization of the armed forces, either as a prelude to war or as a deterrent. The continental Great Powers&#x27; mobilization plans included arming and transporting millions of men and their equipment, typically by rail and to strict schedules.

The mobilization plans limited the scope of diplomacy, as military planners wanted to begin mobilisation as quickly as possible to avoid being caught on the defensive. They also put pressure on policymakers to begin their own mobilization once it was discovered that other nations had begun to mobilize.

In 1969, A. J. P. Taylor wrote that mobilization schedules were so rigid that once they were begun, they could not be canceled without massive disruption of the country and military disorganisation, and they could not proceed without physical invasion (of Belgium by Germany). Thus, diplomatic overtures conducted after the mobilizations had begun were ignored. Hence the metaphor &quot;war by timetable.&quot;

Russia ordered a partial mobilization on 25 July against Austria-Hungary only. Their lack of prewar planning for the partial mobilization made the Russians realize by 29 July that it would be impossible to interfere with a general mobilization.

Only a general mobilization could be carried out successfully. The Russians were, therefore, faced with only two options: canceling the mobilization during a crisis or moving to full mobilization, the latter of which they did on 30 July. They, therefore, mobilized along both the Russian border with Austria-Hungary and the border with Germany.

German mobilization plans assumed a two-front war against France and Russia and had the bulk of the German army massed against France and taking the offensive in the west, and a smaller force holding East Prussia. The plans were based on the assumption that France would mobilize significantly faster than Russia.

On 28 July, Germany learned through its spy network that Russia had implemented partial mobilisation and its &quot;Period Preparatory to War.&quot; The Germans assumed that Russia had decided upon war and that its mobilisation put Germany in danger, especially since because German war plans, the so-called Schlieffen Plan, relied upon Germany to mobilise speedily enough to defeat France first by attacking largely through neutral Belgium before it turned to defeat the slower-moving Russians.

Christopher Clark states: &quot;German efforts at mediation – which suggested that Austria should &#x27;Halt in Belgrade&#x27; and use the occupation of the Serbian capital to ensure its terms were met – were rendered futile by the speed of Russian preparations, which threatened to force the Germans to take counter-measures before mediation could begin to take effect.&quot;

Clark also states: &quot;The Germans declared war on Russia before the Russians declared war on Germany. But by the time that happened, the Russian government had been moving troops and equipment to the German front for a week. The Russians were the first great power to issue an order of general mobilisation and the first Russo-German clash took place on German, not on Russian soil, following the Russian invasion of East Prussia. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the Russians should be &#x27;blamed&#x27; for the outbreak of war. Rather it alerts us to the complexity of the events that brought war about and the limitations of any thesis that focuses on the culpability of one actor.&quot;

== Historiography ==
Immediately after the end of hostilities, Anglo-American historians argued that Germany was solely responsible for the start of the war. However, academic work in the English-speaking world in the late 1920s and the 1930s blamed the participants more equally. Meanwhile German academics also challenged the claim that Germany was solely or primarily to blame.

In the 1960s the German historian Fritz Fischer challenged prevailing German academic opinion by arguing that Germany&#x27;s conservative leaders had deliberately sought war. This in turn unleashed an intense worldwide debate on Imperial Germany&#x27;s long-term goals. The American historian Paul Schroeder agrees with the critics that Fisher exaggerated and misinterpreted many points. However, Schroeder endorses Fisher&#x27;s basic conclusion:

However, Schroeder argues that all of that was not the main cause of the war in 1914. Indeed, the search for a single main cause is not a helpful approach to history. Instead, there are multiple causes any one or two of which could have launched the war. He argues, &quot;The fact that so many plausible explanations for the outbreak of the war have been advanced over the years indicates on the one hand that it was massively overdetermined, and on the other that no effort to analyze the causal factors involved can ever fully succeed.&quot;

Debate over the country that &quot;started&quot; the war and who bears the blame still continues. According to Annika Mombauer, a new consensus among scholars had emerged by the 1980s, mainly as a result of Fischer&#x27;s intervention:

On historians inside Germany, she adds, &quot;There was &#x27;a far-reaching consensus about the special responsibility of the German Reich&#x27; in the writings of leading historians, though they differed in how they weighted Germany&#x27;s role.&quot;

<text>The state highways of Colorado are a system of public paved roads funded and maintained by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) in the U.S. state of Colorado. These are state highways, which are typically abbreviated SH. The numbered highways within the state begin at 1 and increase, with exception of numbers already designated as United States Numbered Highways or Interstate Highways. In 1953, many highways were decommissioned or lost mileage. Before the 1968 Colorado state highway renumbering, highways were cosigned with U.S. Highways and Interstate Highways, and there were highways matching U.S. Highway and Interstate Highway numbers.

==Description==

The numbered state highway system covers approximately 3,135 miles of road in Colorado, subtracting the total miles of Interstate and US Highways from 9,100 miles of the state highway system. These are maintained using state funds which are collected by state and federal gas tax and a portion of vehicle registration fees. Unlike the numbering systems of the Interstate Highway System and the United States Numbered Highway System handled by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the numbered state highway system is a separate system used by the state. The route markers used are separate from neighboring states rather than being consistent. In Colorado, the route markers are designed with the state flag on the top half and the number on the bottom half.

Most state highways are generally two lane roads with speed limits up to 65 miles per hour in rural areas but can drop as low as 30 miles per hour in served communities. In urban areas, they can be six to eight lane expressways primarily in Denver and Colorado Springs. Some numbered routes are concurrent with US highways and Interstate Highways and concurrent sections of state highway are not recognized by CDOT. Concurrent sections generally have their mileage based on the Interstate or US Route mileage (e.g. SH 88 being concurrent with I-25) and are sometimes unsigned. The longest state highway is State Highway 14 with a span of nearly between Muddy Pass and Sterling. State Highway 110 is the shortest route maintained by CDOT with a span of .

The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) is the agency responsible for maintaining the Colorado State Highway System, including Interstate Highways, United States Numbered Highways, and numbered state highways within the state of Colorado.

<text>Prades Tavernier was a weaver and then Cathar parfait in the Comté de Foix in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. Tavernier was originally from Prades d&#x27;Aillon, and he was named after the town. There he became a successful and prosperous weaver. Though unmarried, he had a bastard daughter named Brune Pourcel.

Tired of weaving Tavernier decided to become a Cathar Perfect and traveled the region preaching and performing Cathar rites. In his travels he spent much of his time in the town of Montaillou, which was a centre of Catharism. Unlike most parfait Tavernier did not come from the bourgeoisie and he was not well grounded in Cathar theology. He thus broke a number of rules, such as performing the consolamentum on an infant.

<text>In robotics, robot kinematics applies geometry to the study of the movement of multi-degree of freedom kinematic chains that form the structure of robotic systems. The emphasis on geometry means that the links of the robot are modeled as rigid bodies and its joints are assumed to provide pure rotation or translation.

Robot kinematics studies the relationship between the dimensions and connectivity of kinematic chains and the position, velocity and acceleration of each of the links in the robotic system, in order to plan and control movement and to compute actuator forces and torques. The relationship between mass and inertia properties, motion, and the associated forces and torques is studied as part of robot dynamics. 
==Kinematic equations==

A fundamental tool in robot kinematics is the kinematics equations of the kinematic chains that form the robot. These non-linear equations are used to map the joint parameters to the configuration of the robot system. Kinematics equations are also used in biomechanics of the skeleton and computer animation of articulated characters.

Forward kinematics uses the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters. The reverse process that computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector is known as inverse kinematics. The dimensions of the robot and its kinematics equations define the volume of space reachable by the robot, known as its workspace.

There are two broad classes of robots and associated kinematics equations: serial manipulators and parallel manipulators. Other types of systems with specialized kinematics equations are air, land, and submersible mobile robots, hyper-redundant, or snake, robots and humanoid robots.

===Forward kinematics===

Forward kinematics specifies the joint parameters and computes the configuration of the chain. For serial manipulators this is achieved by direct substitution of the joint parameters into the forward kinematics equations for the serial chain. For parallel manipulators substitution of the joint parameters into the kinematics equations requires solution of the a set of polynomial constraints to determine the set of possible end-effector locations.

===Inverse kinematics===
Inverse kinematics specifies the end-effector location and computes the associated joint angles. For serial manipulators this requires solution of a set of polynomials obtained from the kinematics equations and yields multiple configurations for the chain. The case of a general 6R serial manipulator (a serial chain with six revolute joints) yields sixteen different inverse kinematics solutions, which are solutions of a sixteenth degree polynomial. For parallel manipulators, the specification of the end-effector location simplifies the kinematics equations, which yields formulas for the joint parameters.

==Robot Jacobian==
The time derivative of the kinematics equations yields the Jacobian of the robot, which relates the joint rates to the linear and angular velocity of the end-effector. The principle of virtual work shows that the Jacobian also provides a relationship between joint torques and the resultant force and torque applied by the end-effector. Singular configurations of the robot are identified by studying its Jacobian.

===Velocity kinematics===

The robot Jacobian results in a set of linear equations that relate the joint rates to the six-vector formed from the angular and linear velocity of the end-effector, known as a twist. Specifying the joint rates yields the end-effector twist directly.

The inverse velocity problem seeks the joint rates that provide a specified end-effector twist. This is solved by inverting the Jacobian matrix. It can happen that the robot is in a configuration where the Jacobian does not have an inverse. These are termed singular configurations of the robot.

===Static force analysis===

The principle of virtual work yields a set of linear equations that relate the resultant force-torque six vector, called a wrench, that acts on the end-effector to the joint torques of the robot. If the end-effector wrench is known, then a direct calculation yields the joint torques.

The inverse statics problem seeks the end-effector wrench associated with a given set of joint torques, and requires the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. As in the case of inverse velocity analysis, at singular configurations this problem cannot be solved. However, near singularities small actuator torques result in a large end-effector wrench. Thus near singularity configurations robots have large mechanical advantage.

==Fields of study==
Robot kinematics also deals with motion planning, singularity avoidance, redundancy, collision avoidance, as well as the kinematic synthesis of robots.

<text>Viðoy (, ) is the northernmost island in the Faroe Islands, located east of Borðoy to which it is linked via a causeway. The name means &quot;wood island,&quot; despite the fact that no trees grow on the island; the name relates to the driftwood that floats in from Siberia and North America.

== Geography ==
The island has two settlements: Hvannasund on the south-west coast and Viðareiði on the north-west coast, the northernmost settlement in the Faroes. A road along the west coast of the island connects the two. The island is connected by a road causeway from Hvannasund to Norðdepil on Borðoy, and a bus service from Klaksvík runs across the causeway to the island.

===Important bird area===
The island&#x27;s northern and eastern coast has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (500 pairs), black-legged kittiwakes (5300 pairs), Atlantic puffins (25,000 pairs), common guillemots (6700 individuals) and black guillemots (200 pairs).

===Mountains===

Viðoy has eleven mountains, of which Villingadalsfjall is the northernmost peak in the Faroes. The north coast also has the Enniberg cliff, which at 750 m is the second-highest sea-cliff in Europe (after Hornelen, in Norway). The mountains are shown with their overall rank in the Faroe Islands.

<doc id="1318037" wikidata="Q7891441" url="?curid=1318037" title="Screw theory">
<text>Screw theory is the algebraic calculation of pairs of vectors, also known as dual vectors – such as angular and linear velocity, or forces and moments – that arise in the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies. 

Screw theory provides a mathematical formulation for the geometry of lines which is central to rigid body dynamics, where lines form the screw axes of spatial movement and the lines of action of forces. The pair of vectors that form the Plücker coordinates of a line define a unit screw, and general screws are obtained by multiplication by a pair of real numbers and addition of vectors.

Important theorems of screw theory include: the &quot;transfer principle&quot; proves that geometric calculations for points using vectors have parallel geometric calculations for lines obtained by replacing vectors with screws; 
&quot;Chasles&#x27; theorem&quot; proves that any change between two rigid object poses can be performed by a single screw; &quot;Poinsot&#x27;s theorem&quot; proves that rotations about a rigid object&#x27;s major and minor – but not intermediate – axes are stable.

Screw theory is an important tool in robot mechanics, mechanical design, computational geometry and multibody dynamics. 
This is in part because of the relationship between screws and dual quaternions which have been used to interpolate rigid-body motions. Based on screw theory, an efficient approach has also been developed for the type synthesis of parallel mechanisms (parallel manipulators or parallel robots).

== Basic concepts ==
A spatial displacement of a rigid body can be defined by a rotation about a line and a translation along the same line, called a . This is known as Chasles&#x27; theorem. The six parameters that define a screw motion are the four independent components of the Plücker vector that defines the screw axis, together with the rotation angle about and linear slide along this line, and form a pair of vectors called a screw. For comparison, the six parameters that define a spatial displacement can also be given by three Euler angles that define the rotation and the three components of the translation vector.

=== Screw ===
A screw is a six-dimensional vector constructed from a pair of three-dimensional vectors, such as forces and torques and linear and angular velocity, that arise in the study of spatial rigid body movement. The components of the screw define the Plücker coordinates of a line in space and the magnitudes of the vector along the line and moment about this line.

=== Twist ===
A twist is a screw used to represent the velocity of a rigid body as an angular velocity around an axis and a linear velocity along this axis. All points in the body have the same component of the velocity along the axis, however the greater the distance from the axis the greater the velocity in the plane perpendicular to this axis. Thus, the helicoidal field formed by the velocity vectors in a moving rigid body flattens out the further the points are radially from the twist axis.

The points in a body undergoing a constant twist motion trace helices in the fixed frame. If this screw motion has zero pitch then the trajectories trace circles, and the movement is a pure rotation. If the screw motion has infinite pitch then the trajectories are all straight lines in the same direction.

=== Wrench ===
The force and torque vectors that arise in applying Newton&#x27;s laws to a rigid body can be assembled into a screw called a wrench. A force has a point of application and a line of action, therefore it defines the Plücker coordinates of a line in space and has zero pitch. A torque, on the other hand, is a pure moment that is not bound to a line in space and is an infinite pitch screw. The ratio of these two magnitudes defines the pitch of the screw.

== Algebra of screws ==
Let a &quot;screw&quot; be an ordered pair 
: formula_1
where and are three-dimensional real vectors. The sum and difference of these ordered pairs are computed componentwise. Screws are often called &quot;dual vectors&quot;.

Now, introduce the ordered pair of real numbers , called a &quot;dual scalar&quot;. Let the addition and subtraction of these numbers be componentwise, and define multiplication as 
formula_2
The multiplication of a screw by the dual scalar is computed componentwise to be,
formula_3

Finally, introduce the dot and cross products of screws by the formulas: 
formula_4
which is a dual scalar, and 
formula_5
which is a screw. The dot and cross products of screws satisfy the identities of vector algebra, and allow computations that directly parallel computations in the algebra of vectors.

Let the dual scalar define a &quot;dual angle&quot;, then the infinite series definitions of sine and cosine yield the relations
formula_6
which are also dual scalars. In general, the function of a dual variable is defined to be , where ′(&quot;φ&quot;) is the derivative of (&quot;φ&quot;).

These definitions allow the following results:
* Unit screws are Plücker coordinates of a line and satisfy the relation formula_7
* Let be the dual angle, where &quot;φ&quot; is the angle between the axes of S and T around their common normal, and &quot;d&quot; is the distance between these axes along the common normal, then formula_8
* Let N be the unit screw that defines the common normal to the axes of S and T, and is the dual angle between these axes, then formula_9

== Wrench ==
A common example of a screw is the &quot;wrench&quot; associated with a force acting on a rigid body. Let &quot;P&quot; be the point of application of the force F and let P be the vector locating this point in a fixed frame. The wrench is a screw. The resultant force and moment obtained from all the forces F&quot;i&quot;, , acting on a rigid body is simply the sum of the individual wrenches W&quot;i&quot;, that is
: formula_10

Notice that the case of two equal but opposite forces F and −F acting at points A and B respectively, yields the resultant
: formula_11

This shows that screws of the form
: formula_12
can be interpreted as pure moments.

== Twist ==
In order to define the &quot;twist&quot; of a rigid body, we must consider its movement defined by the parameterized set of spatial displacements, , where [A] is a rotation matrix and d is a translation vector. This causes a point p that is fixed in moving body coordinates to trace a curve P(t) in the fixed frame given by
: formula_13

The velocity of P is
: formula_14
where v is velocity of the origin of the moving frame, that is dd/dt. Now substitute p =  [&quot;A&quot;T](P − d) into this equation to obtain,
: formula_15
where [Ω] = [d&quot;A&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;][&quot;A&quot;T] is the angular velocity matrix and ω is the angular velocity vector.

The screw 
: formula_16
is the &quot;twist&quot; of the moving body. The vector V = v + d × &quot;ω&quot; is the velocity of the point in the body that corresponds with the origin of the fixed frame.

There are two important special cases: (i) when d is constant, that is v = 0, then the twist is a pure rotation about a line, then the twist is
: formula_17 
and (ii) when [Ω] = 0, that is the body does not rotate but only slides in the direction v, then the twist is a pure slide given by
: formula_18

=== Revolute joints ===
For a revolute joint, let the axis of rotation pass through the point q and be directed along the vector ω, then the twist for the joint is given by,
: formula_19

=== Prismatic joints ===
For a prismatic joint, let the vector v pointing define the direction of the slide, then the twist for the joint is given by,
: formula_20

== Coordinate transformation of screws ==
The coordinate transformations for screws are easily understood by beginning with the coordinate transformations of the Plücker vector of line, which in turn are obtained from the transformations of the coordinate of points on the line.

Let the displacement of a body be defined by &quot;D&quot; = ([&quot;A&quot;], d), where [&quot;A&quot;] is the rotation matrix and d is the translation vector. Consider the line in the body defined by the two points p and q, which has the Plücker coordinates,
: formula_21
then in the fixed frame we have the transformed point coordinates P = [&quot;A&quot;]p + d and Q = [&quot;A&quot;]q + d, which yield.
:formula_22

Thus, a spatial displacement defines a transformation for Plücker coordinates of lines given by
: formula_23
The matrix [&quot;D&quot;] is the skew-symmetric matrix that performs the cross product operation, that is [&quot;D&quot;]y = d × y.

The 6×6 matrix obtained from the spatial displacement &quot;D&quot; = ([&quot;A&quot;], d) can be assembled into the dual matrix
: formula_24
which operates on a screw &quot;s&quot; = (s.v) to obtain,
: formula_25

The dual matrix [Â] = ([&quot;A&quot;], [&quot;DA&quot;]) has determinant 1 and is called a &quot;dual orthogonal matrix&quot;.
== Twists as elements of a Lie algebra ==
Consider the movement of a rigid body defined by the parameterized 4x4 homogeneous transform,
: formula_26
This notation does not distinguish between P = (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, 1), and P = (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;), which is hopefully clear in context.

The velocity of this movement is defined by computing the velocity of the trajectories of the points in the body,
: formula_27
The dot denotes the derivative with respect to time, and because p is constant its derivative is zero.

Substitute the inverse transform for p into the velocity equation to obtain the velocity of &quot;P&quot; by operating on its trajectory P(&quot;t&quot;), that is
: formula_28
where
: formula_29
Recall that [Ω] is the angular velocity matrix. The matrix [&quot;S&quot;] is an element of the Lie algebra se(3) of the Lie group SE(3) of homogeneous transforms. The components of [&quot;S&quot;] are the components of the twist screw, and for this reason [&quot;S&quot;] is also often called a twist.

From the definition of the matrix [&quot;S&quot;], we can formulate the ordinary differential equation,
: formula_30
and ask for the movement [&quot;T&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)] that has a constant twist matrix [&quot;S&quot;]. The solution is the matrix exponential
: formula_31

This formulation can be generalized such that given an initial configuration &quot;g&quot;(0) in SE(&quot;n&quot;), and a twist &quot;ξ&quot; in se(&quot;n&quot;), the homogeneous transformation to a new location and orientation can be computed with the formula,
: formula_32
where &quot;θ&quot; represents the parameters of the transformation.

== Screws by reflection ==
In transformation geometry, the elemental concept of transformation is the reflection (mathematics). In planar transformations a translation is obtained by reflection in parallel lines, and rotation is obtained by reflection in a pair of intersecting lines. To produce a screw transformation from similar concepts one must use planes in space: the parallel planes must be perpendicular to the screw axis, which is the line of intersection of the intersecting planes that generate the rotation of the screw. Thus four reflections in planes effect a screw transformation. The tradition of inversive geometry borrows some of the ideas of projective geometry and provides a language of transformation that does not depend on analytic geometry.

== Homography ==
The combination of a translation with a rotation effected by a screw displacement can be illustrated with the exponential mapping.

Since &quot;ε&quot;2 = 0 for dual numbers, exp(&quot;aε&quot;) = 1 + &quot;aε&quot;, all other terms of the exponential series vanishing.

Let &quot;F&quot; = {1 + &quot;εr&quot; : &quot;r&quot; ∈ H}, &quot;ε&quot;2 = 0.
Note that &quot;F&quot; is stable under the rotation and under the translation for any vector quaternions &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.
&quot;F&quot; is a 3-flat in the eight-dimensional space of dual quaternions. This 3-flat &quot;F&quot; represents space, and the homography constructed, restricted to &quot;F&quot;, is a screw displacement of space.

Let &quot;a&quot; be half the angle of the desired turn about axis &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;br&quot; half the displacement on the screw axis. Then form and . Now the homography is
: formula_33
The inverse for &quot;z&quot;* is
: formula_34
so, the homography sends &quot;q&quot; to
: formula_35

Now for any quaternion vector &quot;p&quot;, , let , where the required rotation and translation are effected.

Evidently the group of units of the ring of dual quaternions is a Lie group. A subgroup has Lie algebra generated by the parameters &quot;a r&quot; and &quot;b s&quot;, where , and . These six parameters generate a subgroup of the units, the unit sphere. Of course it includes &quot;F&quot; and the 3-sphere of versors.

== Work of forces acting on a rigid body ==
Consider the set of forces F1, F2 ... F&quot;n&quot; act on the points X1, X2 ... X&quot;n&quot; in a rigid body. The trajectories of X&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1...,&quot;n&quot; are defined by the movement of the rigid body with rotation [&quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)] and the translation d(&quot;t&quot;) of a reference point in the body, given by 
: formula_36
where x&quot;i&quot; are coordinates in the moving body.

The velocity of each point Xi is
: formula_37
where ω is the angular velocity vector and v is the derivative of d(&quot;t&quot;).

The work by the forces over the displacement &quot;δ&quot;r&quot;i&quot;=v&quot;i&quot;&quot;δt&quot; of each point is given by
: formula_38
Define the velocities of each point in terms of the twist of the moving body to obtain
: formula_39

Expand this equation and collect coefficients of ω and v to obtain
: formula_40

Introduce the twist of the moving body and the wrench acting on it given by
: formula_41
then work takes the form
: formula_42

The 6×6 matrix [Π] is used to simplify the calculation of work using screws, so that
: formula_43
where
: formula_44
and [I] is the 3×3 identity matrix.

=== Reciprocal screws ===
If the virtual work of a wrench on a twist is zero, then the forces and torque of the wrench are constraint forces relative to the twist. The wrench and twist are said to be &quot;reciprocal,&quot; that is if
: formula_45
then the screws &quot;W&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are reciprocal.

=== Twists in robotics ===
In the study of robotic systems the components of the twist are often transposed to eliminate the need for the 6×6 matrix [Π] in the calculation of work. In this case the twist is defined to be
: formula_46
so the calculation of work takes the form
: formula_47

In this case, if
: formula_48
then the wrench W is reciprocal to the twist T.

== History ==
The mathematical framework was developed by Sir Robert Stawell Ball in 1876 for application in kinematics and statics of mechanisms (rigid body mechanics).

Felix Klein saw screw theory as an application of elliptic geometry and his Erlangen Program. He also worked out elliptic geometry, and a fresh view of Euclidean geometry, with the Cayley–Klein metric. The use of a symmetric matrix for a von Staudt conic and metric, applied to screws, has been described by Harvey Lipkin. Other prominent contributors include Julius Plücker, W. K. Clifford, F. M. Dimentberg, Kenneth H. Hunt, J. R. Phillips.
The homography idea in transformation geometry was advanced by Sophus Lie more than a century ago. Even earlier, William Rowan Hamilton displayed the versor form of unit quaternions as exp(&quot;a r&quot;)= cos &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot; sin &quot;a&quot;. The idea is also in Euler&#x27;s formula parametrizing the unit circle in the complex plane.

William Kingdon Clifford initiated the use of dual quaternions for kinematics, followed by Aleksandr Kotelnikov, Eduard Study (&quot;Geometrie der Dynamen&quot;), and Wilhelm Blaschke. However, the point of view of Sophus Lie has recurred.
In 1940, Julian Coolidge described the use of dual quaternions for screw displacements on page 261 of &quot;A History of Geometrical Methods&quot;. He notes the 1885 contribution of Arthur Buchheim. Coolidge based his description simply on the tools Hamilton had used for real quaternions.

<text>Henry Theodore Tuckerman (April 20, 1813 – December 17, 1871) was an American writer, essayist and critic.

==Early life==
Henry Theodore Tuckerman was born on April 20, 1813, in Boston, Massachusetts.

His first cousins included Edward Tuckerman (1817–1886), the botanist, Samuel Parkman Tuckerman (1819–1890), the composer, Sophia May Eckley (1823-1874), the writer and spiritualist medium, and Frederick Goddard Tuckerman (1821–1873), the poet.

==Career==
He was a sympathetic and delicate critic, with a graceful style. He wrote extensively both in prose and verse. He traveled extensively in Italy, which influenced his choice of subjects in his earlier writings. These include &quot;The Italian Sketchbook&quot; (1835); his only novel, &quot;Isabel; or Sicily. A Pilgrimage&quot; (1839); &quot;Thoughts on the Poets&quot; (1846); two volumes of verse, &quot;Poems&quot; (1851) and &quot;A Sheaf of Verse Bound for the Fair&quot; (1864); &quot;Leaves from the Diary of a Dreamer: Found among his Papers&quot; (1853); &quot;Essays, Biographical and Critical: or, Studies of Character&quot; (1857); &quot;The Criterion; Or the Test of Talk About Familiar Things. A Series of Essays&quot; (1866); and &quot;Book of the Artists: American Artist Life, Comprising Biographical and Critical Sketches of American Artists: Preceded by an Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of Art in America&quot; (1867).

Articles that Tuckerman wrote for &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; magazine include &quot;Love in a Lazzaret&quot; (1838), a vignette from his travels in Italy, &quot;New York Artists&quot; (1856), &quot;Something About Wine&quot; (1858), &quot;Newport Out of Season&quot; (1858), &quot;Italia Libera&quot; (1861), &quot;Paris: And Life There&quot; (1861), &quot;Obituary of John W. Francis, M.D., LL.D.&quot; (1861). 

Tuckerman, &quot;as America&#x27;s most knowledgeable and dedicated Italophile, missed few opportunities to argue the case for Italian freedom, even though he expressed doubt ... whether Italians were ready to govern themselves. He read and spoke Italian [and] made extended visits to Italy in 1833-34 and 1837-38...&quot; Tuckerman was a close friend of Herman Melville&#x27;s and was prominent in the literary life of New York City after 1845.

Tuckerman wrote a book review for the &quot;North American Review&quot; that indirectly led to the United States offering Giuseppe Garibaldi a position as major general in the Union army during the Civil War. The review included a glowing tribute to Garibaldi. When it reached Garibaldi in Italy, he asked his friend Augusto Vecchi to write a letter of thanks on his behalf. Vecchi did so and also enclosed his own letter suggesting that the United States invite Garibaldi to aid the Union cause. The suggestion reached President Abraham Lincoln, the offer was made, but no agreement was reached because Garibaldi demanded the power to free the slaves, which Lincoln was not ready to do in 1861, and because, as the result of a misunderstanding, Garibaldi thought that he was being offered the supreme command of the Union army.

==Personal life==
Tuckerman died of pneumonia on December 17, 1871 and his funeral was held on December 20, 1871, in New York.

<text>Seweryn Antonowicz Kłosowski (14 December 1865 – 7 April 1903), better known under his pseudonym George Chapman, was a Victorian era Polish serial killer known as the Borough Poisoner. 

Born in Congress Poland, Chapman moved to England as an adult, where he committed his crimes. He was convicted and executed after poisoning three women, but is remembered today mostly because some contemporary police officers suspected him of being the notorious serial killer &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;.

== Early life ==
Seweryn Kłosowski was born to Antoni and Emilia Kłosowski in the village of (today part of Koło) in the Warsaw Governorate of Congress Poland. His father was a carpenter. According to a certificate found in his personal effects after his arrest, he was apprenticed at age 14 to a senior surgeon, Moshko (Mosze) Rappaport, in Zwoleń, whom he assisted in procedures such as the application of leeches for blood-letting. He then enrolled on a course in practical surgery at the Warsaw Praga Hospital. This course was very brief, lasting from October 1885 to January 1886 (attested to by another certificate in his possession) but Kłosowski continued to serve as a nurse, or doctor&#x27;s assistant in Warsaw until December 1886.
Kłosowski later left Poland for the United Kingdom, settling in London; the exact time he arrived in the capital has never been reliably ascertained. A receipt for hospital fees from February 1887 indicating that Kłosowski was still there is the last record of him in Poland, and papers documenting his early life ended abruptly at that month, indicating that he potentially left for the UK at around that time. Witness testimony at his trial seems to indicate that he emigrated in 1888. Kłosowski settled in the East End and became a hairdresser&#x27;s assistant in either late 1887 or early 1888, with records indicating that he worked for an Abraham Radin of 70 West India Dock Road. He stopped working there after five months, and he subsequently opened a barbershop at 126 Cable Street, St George in the East; this was also listed as his residence in an 1889 London directory. It is possible that this was his residence during the Jack the Ripper murders in the autumn of 1888.

In 1889, Kłosowski married a young Polish girl, Lucie Badewski, despite already having a wife back in Poland. He was soon confronted by his first wife, although she soon returned to Poland. The couple had two children and moved around different residences in London before moving to the United States in 1891. The last census record of them in London is from April of that year. The family settled in Jersey City, New Jersey, where Kłosowski found work in a barbershop. However, bitter fights often erupted between husband and wife, culminating in an incident in February 1892 in which Kłosowski attacked Lucie while she was pregnant and threatened to kill her. Lucie returned to London, moved in with her sister and gave birth to a daughter. Kłosowski himself eventually returned to London, and the two briefly reunited before ending their relationship permanently.

In 1893, while working as an assistant in Haddin&#x27;s hairdresser shop, Kłosowski met a woman named Annie Chapman (no known relation to the Ripper victim). They began a relationship, moved in together and he took her surname, thereafter being known as George Chapman. In 1894, after almost a year of cohabiting, Chapman brought another woman to live with them, and a pregnant Annie left a few weeks later. In early 1895, Annie told Chapman about their baby, but he offered no support. That same year, he became an assistant in William Wenzel&#x27;s barbershop at 7 Church Lane, Leytonstone, while lodging at the house of John Ward in Forest Road.

== Crimes and execution ==
Chapman took at least four mistresses, who posed as his wife; he killed three by poisoning. They were Mary Isabella Spink (1858 – 25 December 1897), Bessie Taylor (died 13 February 1901) and Maud Marsh (died 22 October 1902). He administered the compound tartar-emetic to each of them, having purchased it from a chemist in Hastings, Sussex. Rich in the metallic element antimony, tartar-emetic can, if used improperly, cause painful death with symptoms similar to arsenic poisoning.

Chapman had met Spink while working at Wenzel&#x27;s barbershop. Spink, an alcoholic whose husband and son had left her, joined him in a fake marriage and left him a legacy of £500 (). They began living together and leased a barbershop in a poor section of Hastings. This business was unsuccessful, and they moved their shop to a more prosperous location and began offering &quot;musical shaves&quot;, in which Spink played the piano while Chapman serviced the customers. This proved popular, and the couple earned a sizable income. Chapman eventually purchased his own sailing boat, which he named &quot;Mosquito&quot;. However, he repeatedly subjected Spink to brutal beatings. A woman who lived in the same building claimed to have often heard Spink crying out in the night and to have noticed abrasions and bruises on her face and marks on her throat. On 3 April 1897, Chapman purchased a one-ounce dose of tartar-emetic from the shop of William Davidson, a chemist in High Street.

Their barbershop eventually failed, and Chapman resorted to managing a pub in Bartholomew Square. It was there that he fatally poisoned Spink. Soon afterwards, he hired Taylor, who had been a restaurant manager, and they entered into a relationship. Chapman again became abusive, reportedly shouting at Taylor and at one point threatening her with a revolver. After she began coming down with the same symptoms that Spink had shown, Chapman left London with her to avoid controversy, moving to the market town of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, where he ran The Grapes Pub. The couple eventually returned to London, where he leased the Monument Tavern. Despite an operation, Taylor&#x27;s condition grew steadily worse and she died in 1901. Chapman also attempted to commit arson on the Monument Tavern, which was quickly losing its lease.
In August 1901, he hired Marsh as a barmaid for the Monument Tavern. He again entered into a false marriage with her and again engaged in physical abuse. She too was eventually poisoned to death. Suspicions surrounding this death led to a police investigation, which found that Marsh and the other two women, whose bodies were exhumed, had died by poisoning. An indictment for murder could contain only one count and Chapman was therefore charged only with the murder of Marsh. He was prosecuted by Sir Archibald Bodkin and the solicitor-general, Sir Edward Carson, convicted on 19 March 1903, sentenced to death by Mr Justice Grantham, and hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 7 April 1903.

Chapman&#x27;s motives for these murders are unclear, they may have been purely psychological. While Spink had left him a legacy of £500, he gained nothing from the other two victims.

== Jack the Ripper suspect ==

Inspector Frederick Abberline of Scotland Yard, who was one of the original investigators in the Ripper case, is reported to have told George Godley, the policeman who arrested Chapman: &quot;You&#x27;ve got Jack the Ripper at last!&quot; In two 1903 interviews with the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, Abberline spelt out his suspicions, referring to Chapman by name. Abberline thought Chapman was the Ripper because, during the original investigation, he had closely interviewed Chapman&#x27;s first &quot;wife&quot;, Lucie Badewski, and she had told him that her husband often used to go out during the night for hours on end. Speculation in contemporary newspaper accounts and books has led to Chapman, like fellow serial killer Thomas Neill Cream, becoming one of many suspects in the Ripper murders. As far as is known, Chapman was not a suspect at the time of the murders.
Recent writers are divided about whether Chapman should be regarded as a serious Ripper suspect. Philip Sugden considered that Chapman is the most likely candidate among known Ripper suspects, but that the case against him is far from proven. However, John Eddleston rated Chapman at only two (&quot;a remote possibility&quot;) on his zero-to-five rating of Ripper suspects. Paul Begg only dealt with Chapman briefly and evidently did not regard him as a serious suspect.

The case against Chapman rests mainly on the point that he undoubtedly was a violent misogynist. He was known to beat his common-law wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife Lucie down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. Chapman reportedly later told Lucie that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have buried her and reciting what he would have said to their neighbours.

Chapman had arrived in Whitechapel roughly around the time the first murder took place. His description matched the man seen with Mary Jane Kelly (the fifth victim of the &quot;canonical five&quot;) and the murders stopped when he left for the United States. It has even been suggested that he carried out a Ripper-style killing in New York City, the murder of Carrie Brown, but recent research suggests he did not reach the United States until after this murder.

Robert Milne, recently retired from the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Directorate of Forensic Services, presented a paper to the International Association for Identification Conference in 2011 and to the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences in 2014, suggesting Chapman as the most likely Ripper suspect. Based on his expertise, review of investigation documents, and the use of geographical profiling software, he was convinced that the killer lived in the area of the murders; Chapman fit that bill accurately. Milne also discussed a 1902 (or 1901) murder victim, Mary Ann Austin, who had described a client before her death: &quot;a Russian 5ft 7 inches tall with a black moustache [who] visited Mary and in the course of having sex stabbed her and tried to cut out her uterus.&quot;

However, there is a lack of any hard evidence that would link Chapman to the Ripper murders. The main argument against treating him as a serious suspect is that it would be unusual for a serial killer to change his &quot;modus operandi&quot;, from mutilation to poisoning, although some authorities have cast doubt on whether this is as unusual as is supposed. There is also some doubt about whether he could speak English at the time, as the Ripper would have almost certainly had to according to eyewitness reports about the suspect holding conversations with some of his victims, and whether as a recent immigrant, he would have had the intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel district that the Ripper seems to have had. The Ripper appears to have selected victims who were previously unknown to him, while Chapman killed acquaintances, and although Chapman did live in Whitechapel it was not particularly near the scene of the murders.

Chapman&#x27;s story was dramatised twice by Towers of London, firstly in 1949 in &quot;Secrets of Scotland Yard&quot; as &quot;George Chapman... Poisoner, Publican and Lady Killer&quot; and then again in a 1951 episode of &quot;The Black Museum&quot; entitled &quot;The Straight Razor&quot;. Both conclude with a brief argument for Chapman&#x27;s identity as Jack the Ripper.

<text>Sharon Turner (24 September 1768 – 13 February 1847) was an English historian.

==Life==
Turner was born in Pentonville, the eldest son of William and Ann Turner of Yorkshire, who had settled in London upon marrying. He left school at fifteen to be articled to an attorney in the Temple. On 18 January 1795 he married Mary Watts (&quot;bap.&quot; 1768, died 1843), with whom he had at least six children. Among these were Sydney, inspector of reformatory schools, and Mary, married to the economist William Ellis.

Turner became a solicitor but left the profession after he became interested in the study of Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon literature. He settled himself in Red Lion Square near the British Museum, staying there for sixteen years. When his friend Isaac D&#x27;Israeli left the synagogue after a dispute with the rabbi, Turner persuaded him to have his children, including the future Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, baptised in the Church of England, to give them a better chance in life.

Some of his manuscripts were written almost illegibly in the margins of letters, on the inside covers of magazines, or on discarded wax paper. His publisher sent him clean paper but Turner did not use it.

==&quot;History of the Anglo-Saxons&quot;==

Turner&#x27;s &quot;History of the Anglo-Saxons&quot; appeared in four volumes between 1799 and 1805.

Britain at the time of original publication was involved in wars against France and the idea of the Norman yoke (Anglo-Saxon liberty versus Norman despotism) had been around since the seventeenth century. Turner demonstrated Anglo-Saxon liberty &quot;in the shape of a good constitution, temperate kingship, the witenagemot, and general principles of freedom&quot;. Turner researched extensively the collections in the British Museum and the manuscripts of Sir Robert Cotton. In doing so he obtained a working knowledge of Old English.

The &quot;History&quot; had a profound impact on historiography for the succeeding fifty years. Robert Southey said that &quot;so much new information was probably never laid before the public in any one historical publication&quot;. However, the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1804 criticised Turner for a lack of discrimination and for the romantic parts of the work.

Sir Walter Scott acknowledged his debt to Turner for his historical work in his Dedicatory Epistle to his novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. In 1981 J. W. Burrow said Turner produced &quot;the first modern full-length history of Saxon England … It was a genuinely pioneering work, and was much admired, and not without reason&quot;.

He contributed articles on English history to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;, but the titles are not known.

==Historical work==
He continued the narrative in several subsequent works: &quot;History of England During the Middle Ages&quot;, a multi-volume publication covering English history from the reign of William the Conqueror to the accession of Henry VIII; &quot;History of the Reign of Henry VIII&quot;; and &quot;History of the Reigns of Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth&quot;. In 1839, the works were combined into &quot;The History of England&quot;, a twelve-volume set covering all of English history up to 1603.

Against the emergence of the French Consulate, Turner promoted the notion of Anglo-Saxon liberty as opposed to Norman tyranny (strong since the 17th century).

Turner also authored a &quot;Sacred History of the World&quot;, a translation of &quot;Beowulf&quot; and a poem on Richard III.

He was buried in a brick vault at West Norwood Cemetery. His son, Sydney Turner (1814–1879), was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, took holy orders in the Church of England, and became rector of Hempsted. Sharon Turner&#x27;s son-in-law was William Ellis (1800–1881), an educationalist and economist who tutored the British royal family.

<doc id="1318059" wikidata="Q8019613" url="?curid=1318059" title="William Tytler">
<text>William Tytler WS FRSE (1711–1792) was a Scottish lawyer, known as a historical writer. He wrote &quot;An Inquiry into the Evidence against Mary Queen of Scots&quot;, against the views of William Robertson. He discovered the manuscript the &quot;Kingis Quhair&quot; (King&#x27;s Work), a poem of James I of Scotland. In 1783 he was one of the joint founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

==Life==
The son of Alexander Tytler, a lawyer (&quot;writer&quot;) in Edinburgh, and Jane Leslie of Aberdeen, he was born on 12 October 1711. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and studied law at the University of Edinburgh, and was apprenticed as a lawyer to William Forbes. He qualified in 1744 as a writer to the signet (WS) and set up his own legal practice in Edinburgh. He was successful in his profession, and acquired the estate of Woodhouselee near Roslin on the south of the Pentland Hills.

Tytler was interested in archaeology and history. He joined the Select Society founded by Allan Ramsay the painter, in 1754, and took part in its debates. His prescription for a happy old age has been often quoted: &quot;short but cheerful meals, music, and a good conscience&quot;.

His first recorded address (1773) is Campbell&#x27;s Close off the Grassmarket in south-west Edinburgh.

He died at Woodhouselee on 12 September 1792. He was an accomplished player on the harpsichord and on the flute, and was an original member of the Musical Society of Edinburgh.

He is buried in the family vault in the sealed south-west section of Greyfriars Kirkyard known as the Covenanter&#x27;s Prison. His son Alexander Fraser Tytler and grandson Patrick Fraser Tytler lie with him.

==Works==
Tytler contributed papers to &quot;The Lounger&quot;, including one on the &quot;Defects of Modern Female Education in teaching the Duties of a Wife&quot; (No. 16). His first independent work, published in 1759, was &quot;The Inquiry, Historical and Critical, into the Evidence against Mary Queen of Scots, and an Examination of the Histories of Dr. Robertson and David Hume with respect to that Evidence&quot;. Anticipated in its stance of apologetics for Mary Queen of Scots in 1754 by Walter Goodall, his work held the field until the publication in 1869 of John Hosack&#x27;s &quot;Mary Queen of Scots and her Accusers&quot;. It went through four editions, was translated into French in 1772, and again in 1860, and it was reviewed by Samuel Johnson and Tobias Smollett. He wrote a supplement on the Bothwell marriage, published in the &quot;Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland&quot; in 1792.

In 1783 Tytler published &quot;The Poetical Remains of James I, King of Scotland&quot;, as the discoverer in a manuscript in the Bodleian Library of the &quot;Kingis Quair&quot;, the authorship of which he ascribed on grounds now widely accepted to the king. John Thomas Toshach Brown contested the attribution (1896), and his views were followed up by Alexander Lawson, in &quot;The Kingis quair and the quare of jelusy&quot; (1910). &quot;Christ&#x27;s Kirk on the Green&quot;, a comic ballad, which Tytler also attributed to James, is now thought to be of a later date.

Tytler also wrote &quot;Observations on the Vision&quot;, a poem first published in Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Evergreen&quot;, in which he defended Ramsay&#x27;s title to its authorship; and &quot;An Account of the Fashionable Amusements and Entertainments of Edinburgh in the Last Century, with the Plan of a grand Concert of Music on St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day, 1695&quot;.

==Family==
In 1745 he married Anne Craig (died 1783), daughter of James Craig of Costerton. They had eight children, four of whom predeceased him. The survivors were Alexander Fraser Tytler, Colonel Patrick Tytler, and Christina.

His son Lt Col Patrick Tytler married Isabella Erskine, daughter of James Erskine, Lord Alva (one of his legal colleagues).

<doc id="1318062" wikidata="Q3154615" url="?curid=1318062" title="Irving Park, Chicago">
<text>Irving Park is one of 77 officially designated Chicago community areas, and is located on the Northwest Side. It is bounded by the Chicago River on the east, the Milwaukee Road railroad tracks on the west, Addison Street on the south and Montrose Avenue on the north, west of Pulaski Road stretching to encompass the region between Belmont Avenue on the south and, roughly, Leland Avenue on the north. It is named after the American author Washington Irving.

Old Irving Park, bounded by Montrose Avenue, Pulaski Road, Addison Street, and Cicero Avenue, has a variety of housing stock with Queen Anne, Victorian, and Italianate homes, a few farmhouses, and numerous bungalows.

The CTA Blue Line runs through this neighborhood with stops at Addison, Irving Park, and Montrose.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
Irving Park&#x27;s development began in 1843 when Major Noble purchased a tract of land from Christopher J. Ward, upon which Noble established a farm. The boundaries of that farm today would be Montrose Avenue to the north, Irving Park Road to the South, Pulaski Road to the east and Kostner Avenue to the West. Major Noble&#x27;s house on the East side of Elston Avenue just south of Montrose doubled as the Buckthorn Tavern, serving travelers coming to and from the city of Chicago along the North West Plank Road (Elston). After many years of successful farming Noble sold the farm and retired to McHenry County. Four men from New York, Charles T. Race, John S. Brown, Adelbert E Brown and John Wheeler, purchased the farm in 1869 for $20,000 USD. Shortly thereafter they purchased an additional tract immediately south of the Noble farm from John Gray for US$25,000. This parcel, bounded by Irving Park on the north, Grace on the south, Pulaski on the east and Kostner on the west was part of his original farm. The intention of the men was to continue farming, but after seeing the success of suburban communities which had recently opened for settlement, they decided to subdivide their land and create an exclusive settlement, from the city.

An agreement was reached with the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad allowing their trains to stop in Irving Park if the developers would build a station. This was done, and this station, still at the same location, continues to serve neighborhood residents today. The original name chosen for the new suburb was &quot;Irvington&quot; after the author Washington Irving, but it was discovered that another town in Illinois had already used the same name, so the name of Irving Park was adopted.

The original developers all built substantial mansions along Irving Park Boulevard between 1870 and 1874. All have since been razed, with the exception of the Steven A. Race mansion, which was moved at the turn of the century and now stands at 3945 N. Tripp Avenue. Another early home, built for Erastus Brown, father of John and Adalbert, also remains at 3812 N. Pulaski Road although greatly altered. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which was watched from the cupolas of several area homes, brought a new influx of residents who built many unique, but slightly less pretentious homes.

In 1872, the area&#x27;s first church, the Dutch Reformed Church and Society of Irving Park was constructed on the southeast corner of Keeler Avenue and Belle Plaine Avenue. It remained the only house of worship for thirteen years. The building was completely remodeled in 1908, according to plans by noted architect Elmer C. Jensen. Jensen&#x27;s spectacular personal residence in the Colonial Revival style built in 1905 still stands in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on North Lowell Avenue. By the turn of the century, congregations representing the Episcopalians, Methodists, Disciples of Christ, Catholics and Baptists had been established.

===Annexation to Chicago and subsequent development===
The 1880s found residents beginning to miss some of advantages they had left behind in the city, and in 1889 the community, along with the rest of Jefferson Township, was annexed to Chicago. Water piped to the area from Lake Michigan, and the establishments of a fire department and streetcar service along major streets were some of the improvements to occur during the first year after annexation.

Over 200 homes had been built in the original subdivision within the first twenty years. Several additions to Irving Park had greatly increased the original suburb. Grayland, which was opened for settlement in 1874, extended West from Kostner to Cicero Avenue, between Irving Park and Addison. Subdivided by John Gray, the first Republican sheriff of Cook County, on a portion of his extensive farm, it grew around the Grayland station of the Milwaukee Road Railroad, which is still in active use today. Gray&#x27;s first home built in 1856 at 4362 W. Grace survives today in a remarkable state of preservation and is the oldest house in Irving Park. Gray later built a lavish mansion on the northwest corner of Milwaukee and Lowell to reflect his new-found wealth and it was a community showplace. Indoor plumbing with gold fixtures, exotic woods and expensive marbles highlighted his home. It was razed around the year 1915.

Three subdivisions east of Pulaski led to the development of the area in the late 1890s. West Walker is located between Montrose Avenue and Irving Park Road and is characterized by large single family homes in late Victorian, Foursquare and Revival styles. The area south of Irving Park Road was developed by Samuel Gross and was known as &quot;Gross Boulevard addition to Irving Park&quot;. The housing stock is similar to that of West Walker. The section between Addison and Avondale was developed as the &quot;Villa addition to Irving Park&quot; and contains many unique Craftsman and Bungalow style homes fronting on boulevard style streets. The Villa District, as it is known, is a Chicago Landmark district, dubbed by hallowed journalist Mike Royko as &quot;Polish Kenilworth&quot; due to its heavily ethnic hue.

In 1910 the residents of Irving Park established their own park district and created eight local parks, the largest of which is Independence Park. Considered one of the finest landscaped neighborhood parks in the city for many years, Independence Park also served as the site of local 4th of July celebrations. This annual event features a parade down Irving Park Boulevard involving hundreds of children, athletic events, a band concert and an award-winning display of fireworks. In 1933 the Irving Park District merged with the Chicago Park District. Irving Park continued to grow steadily during the first decades of the 20th century. Several large apartment buildings, featuring elaborate wrought-iron fencing, fountains and terra cotta details were constructed primarily north of Irving Park Boulevard. The depression and war years saw many of the larger homes converted into rooming houses and two family homes. The prosperity following the war was diminished when it was learned that the Northwest Expressway (Kennedy) would cut directly through the heart of Irving Park. This resulted in the displacement of many residents, and loss of many homes and businesses. During the 1960s condominiums replaced several larger homes along Keystone, Kedvale and Keeler north of the expressway.

===Present day===

The early 1980s saw a rebirth for Irving Park as a wider audience discovered the beautiful homes and rich history of the area. The Irving Park Historical Society was formed in 1984, to help preserve the neighborhood&#x27;s heritage and its irreplaceable architecture, which has survived since the late 19th century. Since the society&#x27;s inception many homes have been restored and many more restorations are in progress. A survey by volunteers of the Irving Park Historical Society documented several hundred buildings in use which predate 1894, many dating as far back as the 1870s. Some remain intact while many have been modified or remodeled. Others retain just a hint of their former Victorian splendor.

====Serbian community====
During the 1990s the neighborhood saw an influx of Serbian immigrants, today there are many Serbian-owned cafes and restaurants along Irving Park Road. It is said to have about 2,650 Serbian families living in Irving Park as of 2015. Totally the number of Serbians living in the neighborhood is well over 3,000.

== Neighborhoods ==

===Old Irving Park===
&#x27;Old Irving Park&#x27; aka &#x27;Grayland&#x27; is a neighborhood within the Irving Park Community Area of Chicago, comprising its historical core. Its borders are Montrose to the north, Addison to its south, Pulaski Road to the east and Cicero to the west, those of the original two farms that developed here in the 1870s.

===The Villa===

The Villa district () - (Pulaski Road to the west, Addison to the south, Avondale Avenue to the north and east), was built in 1902 by a number of architects, many of them visibly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Prairie Style of architecture. Most notable among these were bungalows designed by the architectural firm of Hatzfeld and Knox, whose partner Clarence Hatzfeld would later design the fieldhouse and natatorium at Portage Park. The area was originally developed as the &quot;Villa addition to Irving Park&quot; and showcases many unique Craftsman and Prairie style homes fronting on picturesque boulevard style streets. Although St. Wenceslaus church, a majestic Romanesque Revival-Art Deco hybrid draws many of the visitors touring the area, this historic church is actually a few blocks south of the district&#x27;s formal boundaries.

===Independence Park===
&#x27;Independence Park&#x27; is a neighborhood within Irving Park that was developed in the 1800s. It shares its name with a park of the same name. Its borders are Irving Park Road to the north, the Kennedy Expressway to the west, Elston Avenue and Central Park Avenue to the east, and Addison Street to the south.

===West Walker===
&#x27;West Walker&#x27; is an area bounded by Irving Park Rd to the South, Central Park Ave to the East, Montrose Ave to the North and Pulaski St to the West.

Its borders are Montrose Ave. to the north, Addison St. to the south, Kedzie Ave. to the west, and the Chicago River to the east.

===Kilbourn Park===
Kilbourn Park (Milwaukee to the north, Belmont to the south, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the east, and Cicero to the west) is a primarily middle class residential and industrial area. Although technically part of the Irving Park community area, the neighborhood is more akin to neighboring Avondale in terms of both its built environment and the sociology of its residents.

===Avondale Gardens===
Avondale Gardens (also known as &quot;Merchant Park&quot;) (Addison to the north, Belmont to the south, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the West, Pulaski Road to the east) has been in recent years relabeled as &quot;South Old Irving Park&quot; by some. Like Kilbourn Park, the neighborhood is more akin to neighboring Avondale in terms of both its built environment and the sociological makeup of its residents than other areas of the Irving Park Community Area. The name Merchant Park owes its name to John and Clara Merchant, whose house in Old Irving has been designated an official landmark by the City of Chicago.

===Little Cassubia===
Little Cassubia () was a historical neighborhood in the Irving Park Community Area between Irving Park on the North, Addison to the South, Kimball to the West and Kedzie to the East. The name &quot;Little Cassubia&quot; was coined by locals because of the Kaszub people living in the area, who also founded the Roman Catholic Parish of Immaculate Heart of Mary.
==Education==

Chicago Public Schools operates public schools in the area. The Kedvale campus of Disney II Magnet School is located in the Old Irving Park neighborhood.

Chicago Jewish Day School is in the community area.

== Politics ==
The Irving Park community has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by large margins. In the 2016 presidential election, Irving Park cast 15,179 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 2,673 votes for Donald Trump (80.44% to 14.17%). In the 2012 presidential election, Irving Park cast

<text>Thomas Underdown, also spelled Underdowne (&quot;&quot; 1566 - 1577), was a translator. He translated the &quot;Æthiopian History&quot; of Heliodorus in 1569, and the &quot;Ibis&quot; of Ovid (1577).
The &quot;Æthiopian History&quot; has been called &quot;the ancestor in a direct line of the Novel of Adventure,&quot; and praised for anticipating every artifice of the historical novel.

Underdown was an advocate for literature as a moral instrument, saying that the &quot;Æthiopian History&quot; was superior as an action story because people are punished for their misdeeds. By contrast, chivalric romance permitted pointless murder and &quot;unlawful lust.&quot;

The first (1569) edition of Underdown&#x27;s translation was dedicated to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. The book went on to exercise a widespread influence on Elizabethan drama and prose romance. In 1587, the year of the 2nd or 3rd edition, anti-theatrical propagandist Stephen Gosson remarked that Underdown&#x27;s book had &quot;beene thoroughly ransackt, to furnish the Playehouses in London.&quot; Among the early works markedly influenced by the translation is Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Pandosto&quot; (1588), a major source for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1581–86). So strong was the influence of Underdown&#x27;s translation on Sidney that 16th century commentator Marechel referred to Sidney as the &quot;Heliodore d&#x27;Angleterre.&quot; According to Moses Hadas, in the introduction to his translation of the &quot;Aethiopica&quot;, &quot;in construction and a hundred details Sidney patiently follows Heliodorus, and the &quot;Arcadia&quot; was the principle model for Sidney&#x27;s successors.&quot;

Although the book&#x27;s influence on Shakespeare is more diffuse, elements of Underdown&#x27;s translation can be traced in a number of plays, prominent among them &quot;Cymbeline&quot;.

<text>Francis Henry Underwood (January 12, 1825 – August 7, 1894) was an American editor and writer. He was the founder and first associate editor of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1857 while still working as a publisher&#x27;s assistant.

==Biography==
Underwood was born on January 12, 1825, in Enfield, Massachusetts, the son of Phoebe (Hall) and Roswell Underwood.

Underwood worked in Kentucky from 1845 to 1850, but his hatred of slavery caused him to quit the state. He became an ardent supporter of the Free Soil Party. Originally, he planned to launch a Free-soil magazine in 1853, but the idea did not come to fruition until &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1857.

Underwood traveled to Britain in August 1885 on SS &quot;Cephalonia&quot;. He arrived in Liverpool and then traveled by railway to Glasgow.

In 1885, Underwood was appointed American Consul at Glasgow in Scotland. In 1893, he was Consul for Leith. He is noted as being a member of Edinburgh&#x27;s &quot;Pen and Pencil Club&quot;.

He lived at 35 Mansionhouse Road in the Grange, Edinburgh.

He died in Edinburgh on August 7, 1894.

Many of the ACLU&#x27;s original landmark cases took place under his direction, including the Scopes Trial, the Sacco and Vanzetti murder trial, and its challenge to the ban on James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Baldwin was a well-known pacifist and author.

==Life and work==

===Early years===
Baldwin was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts, the son of Lucy Cushing (Nash) and Frank Fenno Baldwin. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees at Harvard University; afterwards, he moved to St. Louis on the advice of Louis D. Brandeis. There he taught sociology at Washington University in St. Louis, worked as a social worker and became chief probation officer of the St. Louis Juvenile Court. He also co-wrote &quot;Juvenile Courts and Probation&quot; with Bernard Flexner at this time; this book became very influential in its era, and was, in part, the foundation of Baldwin&#x27;s national reputation.

===Career===
Baldwin was a member of the American Union Against Militarism (AUAM), which opposed American involvement in World War I. After the passage of the Selective Service Act of 1917, Baldwin called for the AUAM to create a legal division to protect the rights of conscientious objectors. On July 1, 1917, the AUAM created the Civil Liberties Bureau (CLB), headed by Baldwin. The CLB separated from the AUAM on October 1, 1917, renaming itself the National Civil Liberties Bureau, with Baldwin as director. In 1920, NCLB was renamed the American Civil Liberties Union, with Baldwin continuing as the ACLU&#x27;s first executive director.

In the meantime, on 30 October 1918, as a conscientious objector himself, refusing even to register for the draft, undergo medical examination, or accept any alternative service such as farming, was sentenced at the Federal Court in New York City to a year in a penitentiary.

As director of ACLU, Baldwin was integral to the shape of the association&#x27;s early character; it was under Baldwin&#x27;s leadership that the ACLU undertook some of its most famous cases, including the Scopes Trial, the Sacco and Vanzetti murder trial, and its challenge to the ban on James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Baldwin retired from the ACLU leadership in 1950. He remained active in politics for the rest of his life; for example, he co-founded the International League for the Rights of Man, which is now known as the International League for Human Rights.

In St. Louis, Baldwin had been greatly influenced by the radical social movement of the anarchist Emma Goldman. He joined the Industrial Workers of the World. Roger Baldwin oversaw, documented and supplied funding for a large number of defense cases for I.W.W. members and investigations throughout the United States. A fully accessible archive of his correspondence with I.W.W branches, investigators and attorneys has been published by Princeton&#x27;s Mudd Manuscript Library.

In 1927, he had visited the Soviet Union and wrote a book, &quot;Liberty Under the Soviets&quot;. Later, however, as more and more information came out about Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime in the Soviet Union, Baldwin became more and more disillusioned with communism and in 1953 called it &quot;A NEW SLAVERY&quot; (capitalized in the original). He condemned &quot;the inhuman communist police state tyranny, forced labor.&quot; In the 1940s, Baldwin led the campaign to purge the ACLU of Communist Party members.

In 1947, General Douglas MacArthur invited him to Japan to foster the growth of civil liberties in that country. In Japan, he founded the Japan Civil Liberties Union, and the Japanese government awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun. In 1948, Germany and Austria invited him for similar purposes. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1951.

===Later years===
In 1968, Washington University awarded Baldwin an honorary doctorate of Laws degree.

President Jimmy Carter awarded Baldwin the Medal of Freedom on January 16, 1981.

===Death and legacy===

A resident of Oakland, New Jersey, Baldwin died of heart failure on August 26, 1981, at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey.

He is the subject of John G. Avildsen&#x27;s 1982 documentary &quot;Traveling Hopefully&quot;.

<doc id="1318080" wikidata="Q5988966" url="?curid=1318080" title="Idiot Savants (game show)">
<text>Idiot Savants is an American television game show on the MTV network which ran from December 9, 1996, to April 25, 1997. It was created by Michael Dugan and Chris Kreski, directed by Steve Paley, and hosted by comedian Greg Fitzsimmons.

The show&#x27;s title refers to a label historically directed toward autistic people with savant syndrome.

==Format==
Four contestants competed through an entire week of shows (Monday through Friday), answering questions in a variety of categories. In each of the first four shows of the week, contestants were eliminated one by one, and the day&#x27;s top scorer played a bonus round for a prize. However, all four contestants returned to start each new episode, and each contestant&#x27;s scores from the Monday through Thursday episodes were added together to create a total that served as his/her starting point for Friday&#x27;s game. The contestant who had the highest total at the end of the Friday episode won the week&#x27;s grand prize, usually a vacation or a car.

Before appearing on the show, each contestant chose a specific topic in which he/she was particularly knowledgeable as his/her &quot;savant category.&quot; These categories covered a broad range of fields such as entertainment, academics, and popular culture.

Many of the questions were asked (or performed) by the &quot;Savant Players&quot;, a group of actors who presented comical sketches that led to the questions. Many of these actors were also writers on the show, including senior writer Tom Cohen, along with Jason Nash, Paul Kozlowski, Eric Friedman, and Shonda Farr.

===Monday–Thursday===
The contestants&#x27; scores were set to zero at the start of each day. On Monday episodes, initial control of Round 1 was determined first by a toss-up question, and later by a random draw.

====Round 1====
The contestant in control chose one of eight categories from a board. A toss-up question was asked, and the first contestant to buzz in with the right answer received 100 points and the chance to answer a bonus question worth 200 points. If that contestant answered the bonus correctly, he/she then had the right to try for a 300-point &quot;Big Gamble&quot; question, the last in the category. No points were deducted for a miss on the toss-up or bonus questions, but an incorrect response on the Big Gamble deducted 300. Whenever a contestant answered incorrectly or ran out of time on a bonus or Big Gamble, the other contestants could buzz in and give the correct answer to steal the points, after which the category would be closed and the contestant in control would choose another one. A category would also end if the same contestant answered the toss-up and bonus, but declined the Big Gamble, or if no one answered the toss-up or bonus correctly.

The round ended when either time ran out or all eight categories had been used. At this point, the lowest scorer was labeled as the day&#x27;s &quot;dunce&quot; and made to sit in a corner of the stage, separate from the other contestants.

====Round 2====
The question format remained the same, but all point values were doubled (200, 400, +/-600 points), and category selection was given to the &quot;Brain&quot; (an on-stage oversized brain featuring a monitor showing a close-up of Matt Price&#x27;s face). If none of the three contestants could answer a particular question correctly, the dunce was given a chance to answer and steal the points, after which a new category was announced. At the end of this round, both the dunce and the lowest scorer of the other three contestants were eliminated for the day. The dunce on any given episode received initial control of Round 1 for the next day.

====Round 3: Brainstorm Round====
Rapid fire questions from a specific category were asked over a period of 60 seconds (later reduced to 45 seconds). Contestants earned 200 points for a correct answer, and lost 200 points for an incorrect answer. The contestant in the lead after this round advanced to the Grand Savant Round.

====Grand Savant Round====
The winner of each day&#x27;s contest played the bonus round for a mid-level prize, such as a vacation or a television set. For the Grand Savant Round, the contestant was placed into a device called the &quot;Cylinder of Shush&quot;, a clear tube somewhat reminiscent of the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot; from &quot;Get Smart&quot;, but covering the entire upper half of the contestant&#x27;s body.

The contestant was then asked a series of rapid fire questions from his or her savant category, and had to answer 10 of them correctly within the allotted time to win the bonus prize. Win or lose, 200 points were added to the contestant&#x27;s weekly total for each question answered correctly. The time limit was originally 45 seconds, but was soon increased to 60 seconds.

===Friday Finals===
Each contestant started with the total points they had accumulated over the previous four episodes. Point values for the first two rounds were doubled (200/400/600, then 400/800/1200), and the lowest scorer at the end of each round was permanently eliminated from the game.

Instead of playing a Brainstorm after Round 2, the two remaining players competed for the weekly grand prize in the &quot;Double Grand Savant&quot; final round. Each contestant entered the Cylinder of Shush and answered questions in his/her savant category for 60 seconds, receiving 1,000 points per correct answer. Once both contestants had played, the one in the lead became that week&#x27;s champion and won the high-level grand prize. Four new contestants appeared the following Monday.

==Awards==
In spite of its short run, &quot;Idiots Savants&quot; won the CableAce Award for Outstanding Game Show in 1997.

<doc id="1318086" wikidata="Q206037" url="?curid=1318086" title="Revolutions per minute">
<text>Revolutions per minute (abbreviated rpm, RPM, rev/min, r/min, or r⋅min−1) is a unit of rotational speed (or rotational frequency) for rotating machines.
One revolution per minute is equivalent to hertz.

== Standards ==
ISO 80000-3:2019 defines a physical quantity called &quot;rotation&quot; (or &quot;number of revolutions&quot;), dimensionless, whose instantaneous rate of change is called &quot;rotational frequency&quot; (or &quot;rate of rotation&quot;), with units of reciprocal seconds (s−1).

A related but distinct quantity for describing rotation is &quot;angular frequency&quot; (or &quot;angular speed&quot;, the magnitude of angular velocity), for which the SI unit is the radian per second (rad/s).

Although they have the same dimensions (reciprocal time) and base unit (s−1), the hertz (Hz) and radians per second (rad/s) are special names used to express two different but proportional ISQ quantities: frequency and angular frequency, respectively. The conversions between a frequency and an angular frequency are
: formula_1

Thus a disc rotating at 60 rpm is said to have an angular speed of 2&quot;π&quot; rad/s and a rotation frequency of 1 Hz.

The International System of Units (SI) does not recognize rpm as a unit. It defines units of angular frequency and angular velocity as rad s−1, and units of frequency as Hz, equal to s−1.

: formula_2

== Examples ==
* For a wheel, a pump, or a crank shaft, the number of times that it completes one full cycle in one minute is given the unit revolution per minute. A revolution is one complete period of motion, whether this be circular, reciprocating or some other periodic motion.
* On many kinds of disc recording media, the rotational speed of the medium under the read head is a standard given in rpm. Phonograph (gramophone) records, for example, typically rotate steadily at , , 45 rpm or 78 rpm (0.28, 0.55, 0.75, or 1.3, respectively, in Hz).
* Air turbine rotating up to (25 kHz)
* Modern air turbine dental drills can rotate at over (13.3 kHz).
* The second hand of a conventional analog clock rotates at 1 rpm.
* Audio CD players read their discs at a precise, constant rate (4.3218 Mbit/s of raw physical data for 1.4112 Mbit/s (176.4 KB/s) of usable audio data) and thus must vary the disc&#x27;s rotational speed from 8 Hz (480 rpm) when reading at the innermost edge to 3.5 Hz (210 rpm) at the outer edge.
* DVD players also usually read discs at a constant linear rate. The disc&#x27;s rotational speed varies from 25.5 Hz (1530 rpm) when reading at the innermost edge, to 10.5 Hz (630 rpm) at the outer edge.
* A washing machine&#x27;s drum may rotate at 500 rpm to (8 Hz – 46 Hz) during the spin cycles.
* A baseball thrown by a Major League Baseball pitcher can rotate at over (41.7 Hz); faster rotation yields more movement on breaking balls.
* A power-generation turbine (with a two-pole alternator) rotates at 3000 rpm (50 Hz), 3600 rpm (60 Hz), and over 4000 rpm ( Hz)
* Modern automobile engines are typically operated around – (33 Hz – 50 Hz) when cruising, with a minimum (idle) speed around 750 rpm – 900 rpm (12.5 Hz – 15 Hz), and an upper limit anywhere from 4500 rpm to up to (75 Hz – 166 Hz) for a road car, very rarely reaching up to for certain cars (such as the GMA T.50), or for racing engines such as those in Formula 1 cars (during the season, with the 2.4 L N/A V8 engine configuration; limited to , with the 1.6 L V6 turbo-hybrid engine configuration). The exhaust note of V8, V10, and V12 F1 cars has a much higher pitch than an I4 engine, because each of the cylinders of a four-stroke engine fires once for every two revolutions of the crankshaft. Thus an eight-cylinder engine turning 300 times per second will have an exhaust note of .
* A piston aircraft engine typically rotates at a rate between and (42 Hz – 166 Hz).
* Computer hard drives typically rotate at – (125 Hz – 166 Hz), the most common speeds for the ATA or SATA-based drives in consumer models. High-performance drives (used in fileservers and enthusiast-gaming PCs) rotate at – (160 Hz – 250 Hz), usually with higher-level SATA, SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces and smaller platters to allow these higher speeds, the reduction in storage capacity and ultimate outer-edge speed paying off in much quicker access time and average transfer speed thanks to the high spin rate. Until recently, lower-end and power-efficient laptop drives could be found with or even spindle speeds (70 Hz or 60 Hz), but these have fallen out of favour due to their lower performance, improvements in energy efficiency in faster models and the takeup of solid-state drives for use in slimline and ultraportable laptops. Similar to CD and DVD media, the amount of data that can be stored or read for each turn of the disc is greater at the outer edge than near the spindle; however, hard drives keep a constant rotational speed so the effective data rate is faster at the edge (conventionally, the &quot;start&quot; of the disc, opposite to a CD or DVD).
* Floppy disc drives typically ran at a constant 300 rpm or occasionally 360 rpm (a relatively slow 5 Hz or 6 Hz) with a constant per-revolution data density, which was simple and inexpensive to implement, though inefficient. Some designs such as those used with older Apple computers (Lisa, early Macintosh, later II&#x27;s) were more complex and used variable rotational speeds and per-track storage density (at a constant read/record rate) to store more data per disc; for example, between 394 rpm (with 12 sectors per track) and 590 rpm (8 sectors) with Mac&#x27;s 800 kB double-density drive at a constant 39.4 kB/s (max) – versus 300 rpm, 720 kB and 23 kB/s (max) for double-density drives in other machines.
* A Zippe-type centrifuge for enriching uranium spins at () or faster.
* Gas turbine engines rotate at tens of thousands of rpm. JetCat model aircraft turbines are capable of over () with the fastest reaching ().
* A Flywheel energy storage system works at – (1 kHz – 8.3 kHz) range using a passively magnetic levitated flywheel in a vacuum. The choice of the flywheel material is not the most dense, but the one that pulverises the most safely, at surface speeds about 7 times the speed of sound.
* A typical 80 mm, 30 CFM computer fan will spin at – (43 Hz – 50 Hz) on 12 V DC power.
* A millisecond pulsar can have near (833 Hz).
* A turbocharger can reach (16.6 kHz), while – (1 kHz – 3 kHz) is common.
* A supercharger can spin at speeds between or as high as – (833 Hz – 1666 Hz)
* Molecular microbiology – molecular engines. The rotation rates of bacterial flagella have been measured to be (170 Hz) for &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;, (270 Hz) for &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and up to () for polar flagellum of &quot;Vibrio alginolyticus&quot;, allowing the latter organism to move in simulated natural conditions at a maximum speed of 540 mm/h.
* The sample in magic angle spinning, a nuclear magnetic resonance technique, typically rotates between and (5–), with experimental instruments reaching speeds as high as ().

<doc id="1318090" wikidata="Q7350585" url="?curid=1318090" title="Robert Vaughan (minister)">
<text>Robert Vaughan (1795–1868) was an English minister of the Congregationalist communion, academic, college head and writer, from a Welsh background. He was professor of history in the London University, and then president of the Independent College, Manchester. He founded, and for a time edited, the &quot;British Quarterly&quot;. 
==Life==
Vaughan was born in the West of England on 14 October 1795, to Anglican parents. He came under the influence of William Thorp (1771–1833), Independent minister at Castle Green, Bristol, who trained him for the ministry: Thorp influenced his early style of preaching, which was declamatory and active. While still a student he was invited (1819) by the Independent congregation in Angel Street, Worcester, accepted the call in April, and was ordained on 4 July, among his ordainers being William Jay and John Angell James. He became popular, and in March 1825 accepted a call to Hornton Street, Kensington, London, in succession to John Leifchild.

In 1834 Vaughan was appointed to the chair of history in London University. His connection with the London University brought him into relations with the Whig political leaders, and increased his influence. In 1836 he received the diploma of D.D. from Glasgow University. In 1843 he succeeded Gilbert Wardlaw as president and professor of theology in Lancashire Independent College, removed (26 April) to new buildings at Whalley Range, Manchester.

Dissatisfied with the &quot;Eclectic Review&quot;, which, under the editorship of Thomas Price, was favouring the policy of Edward Miall, Vaughan started the &quot;British Quarterly&quot;, bringing out the first number in January 1845. During 20 years of editorship he retained its nonconformist character and its theological conservatism, but admitted on other topics a wide range of writers.

In 1846 Vaughan occupied the chair of the Congregational Union. In August 1857 poor health led him to resign his presidency of the Lancashire Independent College, when he was succeeded by Henry Rogers. After ministering for a short time to a small congregation at Uxbridge, Middlesex, he retired to St. John&#x27;s Wood, and concentrated on writing.
In 1867 Vaughan accepted a call to a newly formed congregation at Torquay. Shortly after he moved there, he was seized with congestion of the brain. He died at Torquay on 15 June 1868, and was buried there.

==Works==
By his &quot;Life and Opinions of John de Wycliffe, D.D., illustrated principally from his unpublished Manuscripts&quot; (1828; 2nd edit. 1831, 2 vols.), and his &quot;Memorials of the Stuart Dynasty&quot; (1831), Vaughan gained an initial reputation as historian. He published his introductory lecture &quot;On the Study of General History&quot;, 1834. Other historical works were:

* &quot;Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell&quot;, 1838, 2 vols.;
* &quot;The History of England under the House of Stuart … 1603–88&quot;, 1840;
* Edited for the Wyclif Society, &quot;Tracts and Treatises of John de Wycliffe … with … Memoir&quot;, 1845;
* &quot;John de Wycliffe, D.D.: a Monograph&quot;, 1853; and
* &quot;Revolutions in English History&quot; (1859–63, 3 vols.; 2nd edit. 1865).

Vaughan published his inaugural discourse on &quot;Protestant Nonconformity&quot;, 1843. Taking part in the nonconformist publications for the bicentennial of the Act of Uniformity 1662, his tract in reply to George Venables&#x27;s pamphlet questioning the right of the ejected ministers to a place in the English church was called &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you: an Answer to &quot;How did they get there?&quot;&quot; (1862). As a religious and general writer his other works included:

* &quot;The Christian Warfare&quot;, 1832
* The &quot;congregational lecture&quot;, a series of disquisitions on the &quot;Causes of the Corruption of Christianity&quot;, 1834.
* &quot;Thoughts on the … State of Religious Parties in England&quot;, 1838; 1839. 
* &quot;Congregationalism … in relation to … Modern Society&quot;, 1842; two editions. 
* &quot;The Modern Persecutor Delineated&quot;, 1842 (anon.). 
* &quot;The Modern Pulpit&quot;, 1842.
* &quot;The Age of Great Cities&quot;, 1843.
* &quot;Popular Education in England&quot;, 1846 (expanded from the &quot;British Quarterly&quot;). 
* &quot;The Age of Christianity&quot;, 1849; 1853. 
* &quot;The Credulities of Scepticism&quot;, 1856. 
* &quot;English Nonconformity&quot;, 1862.
* &quot;Ritualism in the English Church&quot;, 1866.
* &quot;The Way to Rest&quot;, 1866.
* &quot;The Church and State Question&quot; [1867].
* &quot;The Daily Prayer Book&quot; [1868].

Some of Vaughan&#x27;s own contributions to the &quot;British Review&quot; were collected in &quot;Essays on History, Philosophy, and Theology&quot;, 1849, 2 vols. He edited in 1866 a folio edition of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, with a life of John Milton.

==Family==
Vaughan married (1822) Susanna Ryall of Melcombe Regis, Dorset, and had several children. Robert Alfred Vaughan was his eldest son; his eldest daughter married Dr. Carl Buch, principal of the Government College at Bareilly, Upper India, who was killed in 1857 at the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion.
