<text>USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;, a sloop-of-war, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Battle of Saratoga of the American Revolutionary War. Her keel was laid down in the summer of 1841 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 26 July 1842 and commissioned on 4 January 1843 with Commander Josiah Tattnall III in command.

==Service history==

===Ivory Coast Expedition===

The ship sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 16 March 1843, but was dismasted in a gale the next day and forced to return to Portsmouth for repairs. She got underway again on 3 May and proceeded down the coast to New York Harbor to prepare for service in the Ivory Coast Expedition. On the morning of 5 June, she was towed to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where, at noon, Commodore Matthew Perry came on board and broke his broad pennant as Commander of the Africa Squadron. At mid-afternoon, the ship stood out to sea, proceeded via the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands and reached Monrovia, Liberia, on 1 August. &quot;Saratoga&quot; operated along the coast of western Africa protecting American citizens and commerce and suppressing the slave trade. She occasionally returned to the Cape Verdes for replenishment and rest for her crew. At Porto Grande, Cape Verde, &quot;Saratoga&quot; rendezvoused with and on 9 September, and Perry shifted his flag to the latter two days later. Much of &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s service in the Africa Squadron was performed in implementing Perry&#x27;s policy of supporting Liberia which had been founded some two decades before on the African &quot;Grain Coast&quot; as a haven for freed Negroes from the United States. The new colony was deeply resented by the local, coastal tribes which had acted as the slave trade&#x27;s middlemen, buying slaves from their bushmen captors and selling them to masters of slave ships. Missing their former profits from the now outlawed commerce in &quot;black ivory&quot;, these natives gave vent to their anger by harassing, threatening, and sometimes attacking the black colonists from America. From time to time, they also preyed upon American merchant shipping.

Perry&#x27;s problem was one of reconciling the conflicting demands of protecting American interests on the African coast, of remaining aloof from African internal affairs, and encouraging the colonists in Liberia. The Commodore&#x27;s prudence, firmness, fairness, and tact in reconciling these conflicting objectives was illustrated by his handling of two incidents soon after the squadron returned to Liberia in the early autumn. Reports greeted him upon arrival that the hostile tribes had been making trouble for the colonists in the colony of Sinoe and had killed two sailors from American schooner, &quot;Edward Burley&quot;.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; sailed from Monrovia on 21 November, and Perry followed two days later with the rest of the squadron bringing along as a guest Liberian Governor Joseph Jenkins Roberts. The American warships assembled at Sinoe on 28 November. The next day, a large force of sailors and Marines accompanied the Commodore and Governor ashore for a conference with an assembly of tribal kings. First on the agenda was the &quot;Edward Burley&quot; incident. Governor Roberts&#x27; questioning of a number of witnesses divulged the following story:

:After the schooner&#x27;s skipper, Captain Burke, had paid a Krooman in advance for serving in the ship&#x27;s crew, the native deserted. Burke retaliated by capturing two canoes and taking their crews prisoner. Then he dispatched two of his own men after a third canoe, but these sailors were themselves captured. After cruelly torturing the two Americans, they killed them. Once he felt sure of the story, Perry held that, while the homicides were unjustified, the Americans had been the aggressors. Perry then stated that the United States government wished to remain friendly with all African tribes but had sent him to protect American lives and property and to prevent Americans from wronging natives. He then dropped the matter, but remained in the area while Liberian colonists aided by friendly tribes drove trouble-making natives back into the hinterland.

In mid-December, the squadron sailed to Little Berebee to investigate the plundering of trading schooner, &quot;Mary Carver&quot;, and murder of her entire crew. During the ensuing palaver, when Perry refused to accept the far-fetched explanation of King Ben Krako, a native fired a musket at the American party. The king and his interpreter, who was known to be one of the murderers, attempted to escape. Commander Tattnall of &quot;Saratoga&quot; killed the interpreter with a rifle shot and the king was also killed in attempting to flee.

After demonstrating the determination and ability of the United States to control events along the coast of Africa, the squadron got underway late in the year for Madeira where it arrived on 18 January 1844. She returned to the African coast via the Cape Verdes and reached Monrovia on 2 March. The late spring was devoted to a cruise eastward along the coast to the Bight of Biafra. Yellow fever plagued the crew during the summer. The ship sailed for the Cape Verdes on 8 July and reached Porto Praia on 21 July. The ship returned to Liberia in September for a last visit before leaving the African coast in mid-October and heading home. She reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 November and decommissioned there on 10 December 1844.

===Mexican–American War===
Recommissioned on 15 March 1845 with Commander Irving Shubrich in command, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was assigned to a squadron commanded by Commodore Robert F. Stockton and originally intended for duty in European waters. However, on 22 April, because of tension between the United States and Mexico over an impending annexation of Texas, this naval force was ordered to the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Norfolk on 27 April and proceeded to the Texas coast. She remained at Galveston, Texas, with Stockton for the remainder of spring. The Commodore sailed for Washington, DC, on 23 June after ordering &quot;Saratoga&quot; and the rest of his squadron to Pensacola, Florida, to replenish their stores.

On 3 July, Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft transferred &quot;Saratoga&quot; to Commodore David Conner&#x27;s Home Squadron which was then operating &quot;... in such a manner as will be most likely to disincline Mexico to acts of hostility ...&quot; &quot;Saratoga&quot; operated in the Gulf attempting to help Conner carry out this mission until she sailed from Pensacola on 4 December for Rio de Janeiro to join the Brazil Squadron.

The sloop-of-war cruised along the South American coast until mid-summer. Then, under orders to the Pacific for service under Commodore John D. Sloat on the California coast, she got underway on 24 August and headed south along the coast. However, after rounding Cape Horn, the sloop-of-war ran into a fierce storm which caused severe damage and forced her to turn back toward home. She reached Hampton Roads on 29 December and decommissioned on 9 January 1847.

Repaired at the Norfolk Navy Yard, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was recommissioned in 1847, Commander David G. Farragut in command. Assigned to the Home Squadron, she rounded Cape Henry on 29 March, sailed south along the coast, entered the Gulf of Mexico, and joined Commodore Perry&#x27;s Home Squadron off Veracruz, on 26 April. Three days later, the sloop-of-war was ordered to proceed some 150 miles up the coast to blockade Tuxpan. She reached the station on 30 April and remained there until heading back toward Veracruz on 12 July. About a fortnight later, she got underway for Tabasco, carrying dispatches; remained at that river port but a day, and returned to Veracruz on 11 August. On 1 September, &quot;Saratoga&quot; relieved Decatur at Tuxpan and remained on station there, despite a serious outbreak of yellow fever on board, for about two months before heading back to Veracruz. After a month there, the ship got underway for the Florida coast to land her sick and replenish her stores. She arrived at Pensacola on 6 January 1848; and, after disembarking all the seriously sick patients at the base hospital, got underway north on the last day of the month. She made New York City on 19 February and was decommissioned a week later.

On 17 April, a week after recommissioning, the sloop-of-war departed New York City and proceeded via Norfolk, Virginia, to the West Indies for service in the Home Squadron. She returned to Hampton Roads on 27 November 1849 and decommissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 30 November.

===Opening of Japan===

Recommissioned on 12 August 1850, &quot;Saratoga&quot; got underway on 15 September and proceeded to the western Pacific for service in the East India Squadron. The highlight of her service in the Far East was her participation in Commodore Perry&#x27;s Opening of Japan. After visiting Japan with Perry in July 1853, she sailed for the China coast and protected American interests at Shanghai while Japanese officials discussed Perry&#x27;s proposals. She returned with Perry in February 1854, and, after the formal signing of a treaty between the United States and Japan on the last day of March, sailed for the Sandwich Islands carrying Commander Henry A. Adams, to whom Perry had entrusted the American copy of the treaty. After leaving Adams at Honolulu, &quot;Saratoga&quot; sailed south, rounded Cape Horn, reached Boston, Massachusetts, in September, and was decommissioned on 10 October 1854.

===Reform War===
The sloop-of-war was recommissioned on 6 September 1855 and, but for a period out of commission in ordinary at Norfolk early in 1858, cruised in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico until decommissioning at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 26 June 1860. She fought in the 1860 naval battle off Anton Lizardo, Veracruz. The &quot;Saratoga&quot; and two chartered steamers defeated two Mexican ships and helped put an end to the Reform War.

===African Slave Trade Patrol===
Reactivated on 5 November 1860, she sailed from Philadelphia ten days later to return to the scene of her first cruise, the west coast of Africa. On 21 April 1861, she captured the slaver, , off Cabinda freeing a cargo of numerous slaves. After word of the outbreak of the American Civil War reached &quot;Saratoga&quot;, she returned to the United States and decommissioned at Philadelphia on 25 August 1861.

===American Civil War===
Recommissioned on 24 June 1863, the ship was ordered to the Delaware Capes for guard duty off the Delaware breakwater protecting Union shipping approaching and departing Delaware Bay and performed this duty through the end of the year. On 13 January 1864, she was ordered to Carolina waters for duty in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. During her service off the lower Atlantic coast, landing parties from the ship made several raids in August and September which resulted in the capture of many prisoners and the taking or destruction of substantial quantities of ordnance, ammunition, and supplies. A number of buildings, bridges, and salt works were destroyed during the expedition.

As the American Civil War was drawing to a close, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was detached on 4 April 1865, sailed north, and was decommissioned on 28 April. For the next decade, only two periods in commission for coastal operations (1 October 1867 to 7 July 1869 and 16 May to 14 October 1871) interrupted the veteran ship&#x27;s rest in ordinary.

===Training ship===

&quot;Saratoga&quot; reactivated on 1 May 1875 for a year as a gunnery ship at Annapolis, Maryland. Another year in ordinary beginning 7 May 1876 preceded her final recommissioning on 19 May 1877 to start more than eleven years as a school ship training naval apprentices. This duty took her to various naval bases and yards along the Atlantic coast and to Europe on occasion. During this period, three of her crew received the Medal of Honor for rescuing fellow sailors from drowning: Apprentices David M. Buchanan and John Hayden off Battery Park in New York Harbor on 15 July 1879 and Captain of the Top William Sadler off Coaster&#x27;s Harbor Island, Rhode Island, on 25 June 1881. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was decommissioned on 8 October 1888.

The ship served on loan to the state of Pennsylvania between 1890 and 1907, operating as a state marine school ship for the Pennsylvania Nautical School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until sold there on 14 August 1907 to Thomas Butler &amp; Company of Boston. The ship was burned as an attraction for the amusement of Revere Beach tourists in 1908.

<text>USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot;, a sidewheel steam frigate, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Susquehanna River, which rises in Lake Otsego in central New York and flows across Pennsylvania and the northeast corner of Maryland emptying into the Chesapeake Bay.

Her keel was laid down by the New York Navy Yard in 1847. She was launched on 5 April 1850 and was commissioned on 24 December 1850, Captain John H. Aulick in command.

==Service history==

===East India Squadron, 1850–1855===
After completing her trials, which she began in January 1851, the side-wheel frigate sailed on 8 June for the Far East to become flagship of the East India Squadron under the command of Commodore John H. Aulick. Aulick&#x27;s orders included instructions to visit Japan and negotiate a treaty opening diplomatic relations with that country. However, before he could carry out his mission, he was forced to give up his command as result of quarrels during the first leg of his journey with Captain Franklin Buchanan, the captain of the flagship and due to an incident with a Brazilian diplomat on board. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; joined Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s expedition as his flagship at Canton and entered Edo Bay with his squadron on 8 July 1853. After Perry had presented his demands and official letter from President Millard Fillmore to the Japanese government on 14 July, the American warships departed on 17 July. On 12 February 1854, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; returned with the squadron to Japan as part of Perry&#x27;s show of force, resulting in the signing of the Convention of Kanagawa on 31 March 1854. The frigate departed Japanese waters on 24 March; and, after operating on the China coast, headed home via the Indian Ocean and the Cape of Good Hope. She arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 10 March 1855 and was decommissioned on 15 March.

===Mediterranean Squadron, 1856–1861===
Recommissioned on 5 May 1856, the ship joined the Mediterranean Squadron in July under the command of Joshua R. Sands. After serving as flagship, she returned and was laid up on 18 April 1858. Reactivated at the New York Navy Yard on 17 August 1860, the ship sailed for Veracruz, a week later and thence sailed to the Mediterranean. On the outbreak of the American Civil War, she departed La Spezia, Italy, on 5 May 1861 and reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 6 June.

===American Civil War, 1861–1865===

The ship was assigned to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron and sailed for Hampton Roads. Late in August, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; participated in the joint Army-Navy expedition to Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, which captured Fort Clark and Fort Hatteras on 29 August. During September, she captured two British schooners: &quot;Argonaut&quot; on 13 September and &quot;Prince Alfred&quot; on 28 September. In the same month, she also took two Confederate schooners as well: &quot;San Juan&quot; on 28 September and &quot;Baltimore&quot; the following day. All four ships were laden with contraband.

Late in October, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; joined Flag Officer Samuel Francis DuPont&#x27;s expedition to South Carolina waters which captured Port Royal Sound on 7 November; took possession of Beaufort, South Carolina, on 9 November; and established a blockade at the mouth of the Broad River the same day. These operations provided the Union Navy with an important base for the future operations of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; served in this important squadron until the following spring, operating primarily on blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina. There, she took British schooner &quot;Coquette&quot; on 3 April 1862, attempting to slip into Charleston from the Bahamas.

On 27 April, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was ordered to Hampton Roads to strengthen the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron which was then making every effort to support Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s drive up the peninsula toward Richmond, Virginia. The Union forces in the area were then threatened by ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, the former USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; and four other Union warships acting under orders from President of the United States Abraham Lincoln bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell&#x27;s Point, Virginia, on 8 May. Three days later, &quot;Virginia&quot; was blown up by her crew, ending her threat to Union shipping in the Hampton Roads area and freed &quot;Susquehanna&quot; for duty elsewhere.

Late in May, the ship was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, and she carried dispatches for Flag Officer David Farragut to the Gulf of Mexico. En route, she captured Confederate schooner &quot;Princeton&quot; on 11 June, and sent the prize to Key West, Florida. On 29 June, she and &quot;Kanawha&quot; seized British steamer &quot;Ann&quot; trying to get into Mobile Bay with a cargo of arms and ammunition. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; continued to operate in the Gulf of Mexico until ordered to New York for repairs in the spring of 1863. While proceeding north, the warship captured schooner &quot;Alabama&quot; off the Florida coast on 18 April. She was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 14 May 1863.

Recommissioned on 20 July 1864, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and participated in the abortive attacks on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve 1864. However, in mid-February 1865, the double-ender was in the mighty force which finally took that Confederate stronghold and closed Wilmington, North Carolina, the Confederate States of America&#x27;s last major port. At that time, she was under command of Rear Admiral Sylvanus William Godon. One of her crewmen, Landsman Henry S. Webster, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Second Battle of Fort Fisher.

===Atlantic Squadron, 1866–1868===
Following the end of the American Civil War, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; brought American delegates to Veracruz bay in Mexico during the destruction of the Second Mexican Empire in order to open up relations with the United States backed Mexican president Benito Juárez. When the &quot;Susquehanna&quot; found out that the acting imperial ruler Maximilian I of Mexico had decided not to abdicate, the ship turned around to head home 1866. The USS Susquehanna also sailed for Brazil and operated on the Atlantic coast of South America until returning home and decommissioning on 30 June 1866. Recommissioned on 2 November 1866, the ship ended her active service as flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron. Decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 14 January 1868, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was laid up until she was sold for scrapping on 27 September 1883 to E. Stannard of New York City.

==In fiction==
The ship appeared in Jules Verne&#x27;s book &quot;Around the Moon&quot;, a sequel to &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, in which the ship rescues the main protagonists from their spacecraft, a projectile made of aluminium and launched by cannon, which splashed down off the coast of the California Peninsula.

<doc id="1329464" wikidata="Q1208250" url="?curid=1329464" title="Hankou">
<text>Hankou, alternately romanized as Hankow (), was one of the three towns (the other two were Wuchang and Hanyang) merged to become modern-day Wuhan city, the capital of the Hubei province, China. It stands north of the Han and Yangtze Rivers where the Han flows into the Yangtze. Hankou is connected by bridges to its triplet sister towns Hanyang (between Han and Yangtze) and Wuchang (on the southern side of the Yangtze).

Hankou is the main port of Hubei Province and the single largest port in the middle reaches of Yangtze.

==History==

The city&#x27;s name literally means &quot;Mouth of the Han&quot;, from its position at the confluence of the Han with the Yangtze River. The name appears in a Tang dynasty poem by Liu Zhangqing. Other historical names for the city include Xiakou (), Miankou (), and Lukou ().

Hankou, from the Ming to late Qing, was under the administration of the local government in Hanyang, although it was already one of the four major national markets (:zh:四大名镇) in Ming dynasty. It was not until 1899 that Zhang Zhidong decided to separate Hankou from Hanyang. Hankou was then divided into four districts, which are Juren, Youyi, Xunli, and Dazhi (). Some of the names can still be found in modern-day Wuhan, where there are geographical names such as Xunlimen, Jurenmen, and Dazhimen. By 1900, this boom town on the Yangtze was referred to as &quot;the Chicago of China&quot; by the media back then.

In 1926, Hankou was officially established as a city, where its municipal government was built in Jianghan district. In the same year, the Northern Expedition reached Hankou, and merged Hankou with adjacent Wuchang and Hanyang to make it the seat of the national capital, Wuhan. But in 1927, when Nanjing succeeded in the fight to be the national capital, Wuhan was returned to its original form, with Hankou being again a city by itself. This time Hankou was established as a &quot;Special Municipality,&quot; which resembles a direct-controlled municipality in present day. Before 1949, Hankou has shifted between being a special municipality and a provincial city. In 1949, Hankou was finally merged with Hanyang and Wuchang to become Wuhan, when the communists arrived in Hankou on May 16.

=== Revolutionary periods ===

Hankou was the destination on the escape route of groups of missionaries fleeing the Boxers in the Northern provinces around 1900. The flight of some missionaries from the T&#x27;ai-yüan massacre in Shan-si is recorded in the work &quot;A Thousand Miles of Miracle in China&quot;, by Reverend A E Glover, one of the fleeing missionaries.


On 10 October 1911, a revolution to establish the Republic of China and replace the Qing dynasty led to the involvement of Hankou in the struggle between Hubei revolutionary forces and the Qing army, led by Yuan Shikai. Although the revolution began in Wuchang with a revolt started by members of the New Army, revolutionaries quickly captured major strategic cities and towns throughout the province, including Hankou on October 12. The Qing dynasty army recaptured Hankou later, but as the revolution spread throughout China, eventually the town and the province came under control of the Republic of China.

=== Foreign concessions period ===

Hankou used to have five foreign concessions belonging to the United Kingdom (, est. 1862), France (, est. 1886), Russia (, est. 1886), Germany (, est. 1895) and Japan (, est. 1898). The German and Russian concessions ended in 1917 and 1920 respectively and those areas were administered by the Chinese government as the First and the Second Special Area.

In 1862, Russian tea merchants arrived in the British concession of Hankou. Russians in Hankou established four factories using assembly lines and machinery to produce brick tea, and became the city&#x27;s richest industrialists in what would become the Russian concession.

Early in 1927, the British concession was occupied in the course of the revolutionary troubles that accompanied the Northern Expedition when the Chinese Kuomintang forces occupied the concession and showed no intention of withdrawing. The Chen-O&#x27;Malley Agreement of February 1927 provided for a combined British-Chinese administration of the concession and in 1929 the British concession formally came to an end. From then on it was administered by the Chinese authorities as the Third Special Area.

In the 1920s and 30s, Hankou was one of the Yangtze River ports patrolled by the US Navy to maintain US interests in the area (Yangtze Patrol).

Hankou was flooded in the 1931 China floods.

Hankou was captured by the Japanese invaders in 1938 (Battle of Wuhan).

An important logistical center, the city was heavily bombed in December 1944 by the US aircraft based in the Chengdu area (part of Operation Matterhorn).

On 19 August 1945, a group of enraged Chinese civilians and soldiers massacred 26 Japanese soldiers in the Hankou reprisal massacre.

The government of Vichy France relinquished the French concession in 1943, and the restored French Republic relinquished it formally in 1946.

The Japanese concession came to an end with the surrender of Japan in 1945.

Before the Communist Revolution, Hankou was the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hankou, covering the province of Hubei. The dioceses in Wuchang, Hanyang and elsewhere in the province were subordinated to it.

In the 1930s, the airports served in Hankow were Wuhan Wangjiadun Airport and Wuhan Nanhu. Wangjiadun served as a civil and military base until 2007 while Nanhu, on the other hand, shut down while Tianhe Airport opened in 1995.

==Modern status==

&quot;Hankou&quot; remains a commonly used name for the part of Wuhan urban area north of the Yangtze and Han Rivers. The name was long preserved in the name of the old Hankou Railway Station (also known as Dazhimen Station), the original terminal of the Jinghan Railway. After the old Dazhimen station closed in 1991, the Hankou name was transferred to the new Hankou Railway Station, which opened in 1991 at a new location, farther away from central city. Railway passengers traveling to Wuhan need to purchase tickets to a particular station: the Hankou Railway Station, the Wuchang Railway Station (near central Wuchang, on the right bank of the Yangtze), or the new Wuhan Railway Station (which opened in 2009, also on the right bank, but a long distance from the historical Wuchang).

Nonetheless, Hankou is no longer the name of an administrative unit (e.g., a district), because its area now falls mostly within Jiang&#x27;an District, Jianghan District, and Qiaokou District. That contrasts with Wuchang and Hanyang, the names of which have been retained in the eponymous administrative districts within the City of Wuhan.

==Media==
Hankou once had an English-language newspaper, &quot;The Hankow Daily News&quot;, which was published by a German individual.

<doc id="1329488" wikidata="Q7649349" url="?curid=1329488" title="Susquehanna Transfer">
<text>Susquehanna Transfer was a passenger station on the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, located in North Bergen, New Jersey located at what today is the Route 495 overpass. It was an interchange station where transfer was possible from the railroad to a bus through the Lincoln Tunnel to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

The station opened on August 1, 1939, south of the old North Bergen station. At the time, the company was in bankruptcy proceedings, as part of the also bankrupt Erie Railroad. The buses were leased from the Public Service Bus Company and were open only to NYS&amp;W passengers transferring to them. The bus fare was 15 cents. The buses allowed commuters to go directly to Midtown Manhattan, rather than taking the train to the Pavonia Terminal over the Erie Railroad&#x27;s tracks and then taking an Erie RR ferry across to Lower Manhattan.

The Erie Railroad also used the transfer station for trains on its Northern Branch, at least through 1957, with an agreement with the NYS&amp;W to use their buses in 1944.

Connecting train / bus service at the site ended in 1966.

The former transfer station is now the site of NJ Transit&#x27;s North Bergen Park &amp; Ride with bus service on the NJ Transit 320 bus route to Port Authority Bus Terminal.

== History ==
=== Construction ===
Walter Kidde, who was the trustee-in-bankruptcy for the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad after filing for bankruptcy reorganization in 1937, noticed that most commuter traffic was heading to Midtown Manhattan, and that the major railroads in the area had or little or no service to Midtown. The Lincoln Tunnel had been completed in 1937, and Kidde offered the idea that it might be faster for commuters to head to Midtown by connecting with bus companies that used State Highway Route S-3. A couple years later, &quot;Railway Age&quot; noted that it was common for passengers from the north arriving at the Erie Railroad&#x27;s Pavonia Ferry terminal at Chambers Street to head back north again since their ultimate destination was Midtown Manhattan. This new connection would save time for commuters heading from Paterson, Hackensack and Butler to Times Square or elsewhere in Midtown.

However, the idea immediately met opposition by bus companies and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad when the Susquehanna proposed this new service in 1938. The Interstate Commerce Commission held hearings during 1938 and 1939 and in May 1939, which fell in favor of the Susquehanna. During this time period, Kidde had proposed bustituting (replacing rail with bus) between North Hawthorne and Butler, but this was torpedoed by neighborhoods opposing the change, such as Pompton Lakes as well as a jump in ridership.

Kidde decided to develop a new plan for the transfer station. The first part was construction of Susquehanna Transfer, a station in North Bergen, where it would meet with Route S-3, west of the tunnel. The original proposal that Kidde offered was to remodel the former North Bergen station to the north and if successful, would be moved southward. However, the difference in cost between remodeling the North Bergen station and constructing a brand new station was small. The new station could include a platform for commuters to transfer directly from railroad cars to buses for the trip to Times Square at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue.

In July 1939, of the five companies that applied for the service, the Public Service Interstate Transportation Company was selected to run the bus routes. The buses left at fixed times, and the Susquehanna adjusted the train schedule to connect with the buses. The station facility was finished before the end of the month and on July 31, as a soft opening, morning train No. 924 ran from Butler to Susquehanna Transfer, and that evening, train No. 919 returned to Butler. The next day, the station fully opened to the public, with 65 passengers using the transfer station. With ridership quickly increasing, the Erie Railroad added service to the transfer station on their Northern Branch on September 25.

=== Promotion ===

In opening Susquehanna Transfer, Kidde&#x27;s work became a heavy promotion point for Susquehanna independence from the Erie Railroad. On September 25, 1939, the Erie Railroad added two special trains to their schedule for midday service, the &quot;Noontimer&quot; and the &quot;Matinee Special&quot;. The increase in service also benefited the Susquehanna financially, showing the railroad made 2.34% in October 1939 than it did in October 1938. Public Service also did their part, advertising the Susquehanna service heavily with wall maps and pictures in Times Square.

The railroad also decided to reconstruct the former Paterson City Branch, which had been without passenger service since 1926. The Susquehanna received permission to spend $14,000 (1940 USD) to reconstruct the roadbed and an extra $9,000 to build a brand new station to replace the old brick depot. The Susquehanna almost sold off the rights of the branch to the city of Paterson, but instead was reconstructing it for railroad service. The Paterson City station re-opened on July 15, 1940 and was quickly required to be expanded twice by 1941.

In order to make service suitable, the new service would require the best new equipment. The Susquehanna was still using steam locomotives and Kidde felt it would require upgrading service. The use of steam locomotives still required turning engines at various Susquehanna facilities, including Butler, Pavonia Terminal, etc. Kidde wanted new equipment from France for the service that he saw at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. This new equipment would be able to go and hold at least 78 passengers. This would get people from Paterson City to Susquehanna Transfer in as low as 20 minutes dependent on stops. A test of equipment in 1939 resulted in a Butler to Pavonia Terminal time of 44 minutes, and a run from Broadway–Paterson station to Susquehanna Transfer in 17 minutes.

On October 7, 1939, Kidde announced that new railcars had been ordered from the American Car and Foundry Company with expectation that service would be running by May 1940. This new car, called the &quot;Motorailer&quot; or &quot;Model 60&quot;, was lighter and had a manual transmission. The cars had a 290-horsepower engine and after construction of the new cars, they were tested on June 6, 1940 and just three weeks later, Kidde and Burton K. Wheeler as well as other dignitaries ran the new Motorailers from Times Square to Beaver Lake.

On July 1, 1940, Kidde announced that bus fare was reduced to 10 cents, made possible by increased usage by commuters.

<text>Raoul Armand Jerzy (von) Koczalski (3 January 1884 – 24 November 1948) was a Polish pianist and composer. He also used the pseudonym Georg Armand(o) Koczalski.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Warsaw, Koczalski was taught first by his mother, then by Julian Gadomski (1888–1890). Having made his first public appearance in 1888 (aged 4), his parents took him to play for Anton Rubinstein, who foresaw the possibility of a performing career. He never studied at a conservatory but had further private lesson on the piano and in composition with Ludwig Marek (1891–1892), Karol Mikuli (1893–1895) (Chopin&#x27;s favorite Polish student and composer) and instrumentation with Henryk Jarecki (1893–1894). At the age of 7 he gave concerts, and at 9 he was playing in major European cities as a virtuoso. His thousandth concert was given in Leipzig in 1896, and by the age of 12 he had received awards such as the Order of the Lion and Sun (from the Shah of Persia), the title of Court Pianist (from the King of Spain), and a medal from the Turkish Sultan. Already as a child he had a very extensive repertoire. During World War I he was interned in Bad Nauheim, Germany.

===Composer and writer===
As a composer, Koczalski created numerous works for solo piano, instrumental concertos for various solo instruments with orchestra, works for orchestra, music-dramatic works for the stage, chamber music in various instrumentations, as well as many songs with piano accompaniment. Most of the compositions were published abroad (Germany, Russia, France). Koczalski&#x27;s compositions are largely forgotten today. Stylistically, they belong to the late romantic period. The great upheavals in the field of contemporary music (atonality, twelve-tone music) that took place during Koczalski&#x27;s creative period had no influence on his style. 

In a book devoted to Chopin, published in 1936, he clearly takes a stand against contemporary music. He considers the experiments of the last 25 years, which sought new paths on a &quot;cerebral, mathematical basis,&quot; to have failed, and he calls the representatives of modern music, whom he calls &quot;experimenters, modernists, tinkerers, subversives,&quot; &quot;sad ghosts of an even sadder time.&quot; In this sense, he conformed to the perspective of the Nazi political class in power during the late 1930s.

Koczalski&#x27;s remarks about the character and interpretation of Chopin&#x27;s music remain valid, although the style of interpretation of many modern pianists no longer corresponds to what the tradition of the great Chopin players of the past. Knowledge of Koczalski&#x27;s planned edition of Chopin&#x27;s piano works would have been very important for the performance practice of Chopin&#x27;s piano works.

===Performer===

Koczalski was highly esteemed as a performer of Chopin in Germany, where he lived during the 1920s and 1930s. During these years he also wrote many reviews, using his pseudonym, founded a music school that went bankrupt, and reestablished himself as a concert pianist by 1934. He toured in France, Italy and Poland, but (despite many invitations) not in the United States for reasons of health. During World War II he was again interned (in Berlin), and in 1945 he went to live in Poznań, accepting a post as professor in the State Higher School of Music.

As a performer, the complete works of Chopin and the complete Beethoven sonatas lay at the core of a very extensive repertoire from the classical and romantic genres. He was considered one of the greatest interpreters of Chopin&#x27;s music and one of the greatest pianists of his time, with a very liquid technique, smooth balance and interpretations that did not take the liberties of many of his contemporaries, remaining closer to the written score. According to Seidle (2003), &quot;(h)is playing avoids extremes, is clear, colourful, with flowing, subtle phrasing and broad dynamics&quot;. (&quot;Sein Spiel meidet Extreme, ist klar, farbig, mit fließender, subtiler Phrasierung und breiter Dynamik.&quot;) His pupils included Detlef Kraus, Monique de La Bruchollerie, Hanna Rudnicka-Kruszewska, Wanda Losakiewicz and Irena Wyrzykowska-Mondelska.

Koczalski died in Poznań aged 64.

<text>Kyal Reese Marsh (born 16 August 1987) is an Australian former actor and model. He was born in Clare, South Australia. He moved to Melbourne with his family when he was one year old. He is now a managing director in the building industry at Fitzroy Shopfitting &amp; Building in Melbourne.

==Acting &amp; modelling career==
Marsh appeared in the television soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, where he played the regular character Boyd Hoyland, who first featured on the show in June 2002. Before that he worked as a child model, but &quot;Neighbours&quot; was his first credited acting role. He attended a private school called Wesley College in Melbourne, but dropped out at 15. In April 2005, &quot;TV Hits&quot; magazine published an interview in which he said that he planned to carry on being in &quot;Neighbours&quot; for at least three more years. However it became known in early 2007 that his contract will not be renewed and that he finished filming in April 2007. His character left the show for the last time in August 2007. Marsh quit acting after Neighbours.

==Gymnastics &amp; &quot;Cirque De Celebrite&quot;==
That summer Marsh moved to the United Kingdom, and in September 2007 he was announced as a cast member for the next series of the Sky One reality show &quot;Cirque de Celebrite&quot;, which is filmed on Woolwich Common in South East London. Marsh won the series final on 9 December 2007. According to his contestant biography for the show, Marsh&#x27;s love of extreme sports fuelled his willingness to participate in the competition, including his ability in gymnastics, which he took briefly when he was younger.

==Family==
Marsh&#x27;s younger sister Cobé Marsh was a contestant on Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model, Cycle 3. She is now attempting to become a recording artist.

<text>Gill Airways was a regional airline with its head office in New Aviation House on the grounds of Newcastle Airport in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, United Kingdom.

==History==
Founded in 1969 by Michael Gill, the airline originally operated as Gill Aviation, mainly providing cargo and mail flights for various companies including the British Royal Mail. Following the acquisition of passenger aircraft in June 1989, the airline changed its name to Gill Air. The arrival of Fokker 100 aircraft in 1995 resulted in the airline entering into a codeshare agreement with Air France between Newcastle upon Tyne and Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. The title of Gill Airways was adopted in 1995, to reflect the growing importance of passenger operations to the airline.

===Administration and closure===
After emerging from administration in 2000, the airline seemed to have a promising future ahead of it. However, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the principal financier, the Bank of Scotland, withdrew funding. The final day of operations was 20 September 2001, with the airline placed into liquidation and the loss of 240 jobs.

===Revival and rebranding===
On 1 September 2009, an application for a Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence was made by Gill Airways Ltd, of Birmingham. However, in early 2010, the company rebranded as Cello Aviation, which later ceased trading.

==Fleet==
Gill Airways used to have the following types of aircraft:
* ATR 42
* ATR 72
* BAe 146
* Fokker 100
* Shorts 330
* Shorts 360

==Aircraft on display==
* A Gill Airways Shorts 330 G-OGIL preserved in its original colours can be found at the North East Aircraft Museum, Sunderland, Tyne &amp; Wear.

<text>Mondo Trasho is a 1969 American 16mm mondo black comedy film by John Waters. The film stars Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, David Lochary and Mink Stole. It contains very little dialogue, the story being told mostly through musical cues.

==Plot==
After an introductory sequence during which chickens are beheaded on a chopping block, the main action begins. Platinum blond bombshell Mary Vivian Pearce begins her day by riding the bus and reading Kenneth Anger&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;.

Bombshell is later seduced by a hippie degenerate &quot;shrimper&quot; (foot fetishist), who starts molesting her feet while she fantasizes about being Cinderella. She is then hit by a car driven by Divine, a portly blonde who was trying to pick up an attractive hitchhiker whom she imagines naked.

Divine places Bombshell in the car and drives to a thrift store where she steals clothes for her and later steals shoes from a dead homeless woman.

The Bombshell is then brought to a coin laundry where Divine cleans her face up with a wipe and changes her into the clothes she stole. Divine is then visited by the Blessed Virgin Mary (Margie Skidmore)—during which Divine exclaims, &quot;Oh Mary ... teach me to be Divine&quot;. Divine is then gifted a wheelchair by Mary which she uses to wheel the unconscious Bombshell around.

When Divine returns to her car she is in shock to see that it has been stolen by a man in sunglasses. While trying to take a detour to the doctor&#x27;s, Divine and the bombshell are then captured in a violent asylum.

At the asylum, Divine is robbed of a cigarette and watches in disgust as topless tap dancer get sexually assaulted before Virgin Mary visits her again, this time giving her a hunting knife. After seeing the miracle, the inmates break out of the asylum and flee happily into Baltimore

Divine finally takes the unconscious Bombshell to Dr. Coathanger and his dangerously ill nurse, who amputates her feet and replace them with bird-like monster feet which she can tap together to transport herself around Baltimore.

Meanwhile Divine is interrogated by a reporter which she shows disdain to until the camera starts taking photos. She is then beaten by a member of the police, which leads to a gunfight between him and many bystanders. Divine throws a lamp at the police officer and wrestles with the officer until she kills him, she accidentally stabs herself in the stomach in the process. After Dr. Coathanger tries to abduct a high school girl, he drops the Bombshell and Divine in the woods but as she is about to succumb to her wounds, she is taken and &quot;granted divinity,&quot; by Virgin Mary.

The Bombshell then travels across Baltimore with her bird feet, which leads to her being mooned by greasers in an alley and being repeatedly insulted by two snobs.

==Cast==
==Production==
Depending on versions of the story; either Waters or the whole crew (except Divine) was either arrested or nearly arrested during production for illegally shooting a scene involving a nude hitchhiker on the campus of Johns Hopkins University. However, according to contemporary newspaper accounts, only one person was immediately arrested, actor Mark P. Isherwood. Charged sometime later were John Waters, Nancy Stoll, David C. Lochary and Mary V. Pearce, all five for indecent exposure, but the charges were eventually dropped.

===Title===
The film&#x27;s title refers to a series of semi-related quasi-documentary films that were popular during the 1960s: &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;, &quot;Mondo Freudo&quot;, &quot;Mondo Bizarro&quot;, etc. The title also pays tribute to &quot;Mondo Topless&quot;, a film by one of Waters&#x27; favorite directors, Russ Meyer.

===Music===
Waters, in a 2008 interview, stated that the songs used in the film were taken right out of his own record collection. Waters says he did not pay the proper licensing fees to use these songs because he could not afford to. It is because of this, Waters says, that &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; remains out of distribution, as the still-unsecured music rights would be too prohibitively expensive to clear.

==Reception==
Waters stated that upon &quot;Mondo Trasho&#x27;s&quot; release, it received &quot;some national attention,&quot; namely by The Cockettes who Divine performed with after the film&#x27;s release.

&quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; currently holds a 43% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on seven reviews.

==Background==
Waters himself has stated that he does not care for this movie. In an interview with British Film Institute Waters said it should have been a short film instead of a feature but was a feature-length due to being influenced by films such as Andy Warhol&#x27;s experimental film &quot;Sleep&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was only produced in 1984 on a 95-minute R-rated VHS with hi-fi mono sound in black and white by Cinema Group Home Video.

In an interview with the Harvard Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on tour for his book release of &quot;Mr Know-It-All: The Tarnished Wisdom of a Filth Elder&quot; (2019), Waters stated that &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; would never get released again due to copyright issues with the music and that it would cost $1 million dollars just to secure rights for the music.

<doc id="1329540" wikidata="Q4435896" url="?curid=1329540" title="List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)">
<text>The Commander-in-Chief of India, Lord Kitchener carried out a reform of the British Indian Army in 1903. These reforms were intended to improve the Army, which had been formed from the separate Bengal, Bombay and Madras presidency armies in 1895 to be replaced by the Bengal, Bombay, Madras and Punjab commands. The localisation of regiments was abolished, and in future every regiment was to have the opportunity of experiencing service on the Frontier.

To signify the unification of the three presidency armies, regiments in all Corps were assigned new designations with distinct numerals. The Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Sappers and Miners were numbered consecutively, with presidency names removed. Cavalry regiments were numbered as follows:

*Bengal regiments retained their existing numbers.
*20 was added to the numbers of Punjab regiments. The word &#x27;Punjab&#x27; was replaced by &#x27;Frontier Force&#x27;.
*25 was added to the numbers of Madras regiments.
*1st, 2nd, and 4th Regiments of Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent were re-numbered as 20th, 29th and 30th.
*30 was added to the numbers of Bombay regiments.
*The Central India Horse regiments were brought into the line with 37 added to their numbers.

Infantry regiments were numbered as follows:
*Bengal regiments retained their existing numbers. As the 9th, 42nd, 43rd, and 44th regiments were Gurkha Rifle regiments, they were transferred to the Gurkha Line as 9th, 6th, 7th and 8th Gurkha Rifles. Their places were filled by infantry units from Local Corps.
*50 was added to the numbers of Sikh Infantry regiments.
*Punjab regiments, less the 5th Gurkhas, were numbered consecutively as the 55th to 59th; so that, for example, the 2nd and 4th Punjab Infantry became 56th and 57th respectively. The word &#x27;Punjab&#x27; was replaced by &#x27;Frontier Force&#x27;.
*60 was added to the numbers of Madras regiments (53 to that of the 25th regiment of Madras Infantry). The 10th regiment was transferred to the Gurkha Line as the 10th Gurkha Rifles. The remaining Burma regiments were renamed as &quot;Punjabis&quot; (except the 33rd, which became 93rd Burma Infantry). Regiments which recruited from north-western India were renamed as &quot;Punjabis&quot;, while those recruiting from southern India were renamed as &quot;Carnatic Infantry&quot;.
*93 was added to the numbers of Hyderabad Contingent regiments.
*100 was added to the numbers of Bombay regiments.

By 1903, the total strength of the Indian Army was 240,000 men. They served in 39 cavalry regiments, 135 infantry battalions (including 17 Gurkha), a joint cavalry-infantry unit the Corps of Guides, three sapper regiments and 12 mountain artillery batteries. In addition to the regular Indian Army, the armies of the Princely states, and regiments of the Auxiliary force (European volunteers) could also be called on to assist in an emergency. The Princely states had 22,613 men in 20 cavalry regiments and 14 infantry battalions. The Auxiliary force could field another 40,000 men in 11 regiments of horse and 42 volunteer infantry battalions. Also available were the Frontier Militia and the Military Police, which could field 34,000 men between them.

<doc id="1329570" wikidata="Q944914" url="?curid=1329570" title="Alphabetical (album)">
<text>Alphabetical is the second studio album by French indie pop band Phoenix, released in 2004. The album has two singles, &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; and &quot;Run Run Run&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The album has sold 30,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. Overall it has shipped 170,000 copies worldwide with 65,000 shipped units in continental Europe and Japan, 20,000 of those were in France.

==Critical response==
&quot;Alphabetical&quot; was met with largely positive reviews. DIY Magazine called the record &quot;a beautiful and melodious, yet still not quite on a par with some of their debut album.&quot; Drowned in Sound described &quot;Alphabetical&quot; as &quot;a deceptively simply album; a lot of work has gone into making tunes as beautifully organic as this sound so impressively pieced together.&quot; They gave the album 8/10, concluding it to be &quot;so utterly, utterly Parisian. Not French, mind, Parisian. But what else did you expect? The most sophisticated, deliciously out of step pop album of 2004 simply had to come from the most urbane, beautiful city in the world.&quot; Pitchfork praised the lead single &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; as &quot;a glorious example of how to write a classically ambiguous soft-pop song.&quot; They gave the album a score of 6.7 describing the entire record as something that &quot;doesn&#x27;t ask you to remember it in the morning.&quot;

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
*Deck D&#x27;Arcy – bass guitar, keyboards and backing vocals
*Laurent Brancowitz – guitar, keyboards and backing vocals

<text>Semmelweis University (Hungarian: &quot;Semmelweis Egyetem&quot;, ) is a research-led medical school in Budapest, Hungary, founded in 1769. With six faculties and a doctoral school it covers all aspects of medical and health sciences.

The university is also the largest provider of health care services in Hungary. Most of the departments cater for the most serious cases and patients requiring complex treatment.

As the highest listed institution in Hungary in the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Semmelweis University is among the top 300 universities in the world.

== History ==
The University of Trnava, founded in 1635, was lacking medical training for a long time, so Hungarian doctors were only able to study at foreign universities or in private schools, and surgeons were trained in guilds. Maria Theresa’s court physician, following the Empress’s decree of 7 November 1769, developed the plan of the new faculty, on the basis of the Vienna model. In 1770, education began with five departments. 

In 1777, the university, and thus medical education, moved to Buda, and in 1784, following Joseph II’s personal decree, to the other side of the Danube: to Pest. The rapidly developing Pest provided a wider range of ‘patient material’, and the departments also multiplied. There was space for a botanical garden, and anatomy as well actual patient care could also be taught more effectively. 

At the end of the 19th century the establishment of the present theoretical institutes and clinical departments started. Those buildings in Budapest are still in use after reconstruction and modernization. During the 20th and 21st centuries new clinics and institutes were built. 

From 1951, the Faculty of Medicine continued as an independent medical school and in 1955, Faculties of Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences were incorporated into the new medical University. In 1969, it adopted the name of its most famous professor, Ignáz Semmelweis.

Semmelweis University was the first Hungarian higher educational institution, which started to offer an international program at the Faculty of Medicine in German in 1983, while its international program in English started in 1987, at the Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

From 1 August 2021, the founder’s, owner’s and operator’s rights of Semmelweis University are exercised by the Foundation for National Health Care and Medical Education following the model change in higher education. 

==Faculties==
Semmelweis University is a specialised university offering undergraduate and graduate courses only in the field of health sciences. The university has more than 14,000 students from 110 nations, with foreign students accounting for about 37% of the total community. The largest and oldest faculty of the university is the Faculty of Medicine with 5,300 students accounting for 37% of the total number of students.

==Buildings and sites==
The university does not have a campus. Instead, its faculties, departments, hospitals, clinics, libraries, sport and accommodation facilities are scattered throughout the capital city Budapest. Some facilities are clustered, and most of its clinical departments belong to one of the three clinical blocks. 

The university&#x27;s Theoretical Building at Nagyvárad tér is one of the tallest high rise in Hungary. It houses several research institutions, a student centre, the office of the Students’ Union, auditoriums, conference halls and the country&#x27;s largest stained glass installations.

The previously fragmented Faculty of Health Sciences was united in 2003 in the newly renovated Art Nouveau building of a former sanatorium. The faculty&#x27;s building houses clinical skills laboratories and contains various social spaces for students to use, such as an atrium with couches and a garden.

The Dental Clinical and Training Centre was completed in 2007, accommodating clinics and institutions.

The Basic Medical Science Centre was built in 2008. Over a third of its area is used for scientific research, and it also has auditoriums and smaller lecture halls. The building is also home to several research groups that participate in international collaborations.

The Inner Clinical Block is located close to the Corvin-negyed metro station and contains the main building and some of the university&#x27;s hospitals. The main building houses the Rector&#x27;s Office, the Deans’ Offices and other organisational and administrative units, as well as Semmelweis Salon, a venue for scientific symposia.

== Administration ==
The main governing body of Semmelweis University is the Senate, with the rector as its president.

<doc id="1329576" wikidata="Q1549039" url="?curid=1329576" title="Constitution of Ukraine">
<text>The Constitution of Ukraine (, ) is the fundamental law of Ukraine. The constitution was adopted and ratified at the 5th session of the &quot;Verkhovna Rada&quot;, the parliament of Ukraine, on 28 June 1996. The constitution was passed with 315 ayes out of 450 votes possible (300 ayes minimum). All other laws and other normative legal acts of Ukraine must conform to the constitution. The right to amend the constitution through a special legislative procedure is vested exclusively in the parliament. The only body that may interpret the constitution and determine whether legislation conforms to it is the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. Since 1996, the public holiday Constitution Day is celebrated on 28 June.

In 2004, amendments were adopted that significantly changed Ukraine&#x27;s political system; these changes are sometimes referred to as the 2004 Constitution. In 2010, then-President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych reverted these changes on the basis of a ruling made by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. Following the events of Euromaidan (2013–2014), the 2004 amendments were reinstated.

==History==

Until 8 June 1995, Ukraine&#x27;s supreme law was the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Ukrainian SSR (adopted in 1978, with numerous later amendments). On 8 June 1995, President Leonid Kuchma and Speaker Oleksandr Moroz (acting on behalf of the parliament) signed the Constitutional Agreement for the period until a new constitution could be drafted.

The first constitution since independence was adopted during an overnight parliamentary session after almost 24 hours of debate of 27–28 June 1996, unofficially known as &quot;the constitutional night of 1996.&quot; The Law No. 254/96-BP ratifying the constitution, nullifying previous constitutions and the Agreement was ceremonially signed and promulgated in mid-July 1996. According to a ruling of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, the constitution took force at the moment when the results of the parliamentary vote were announced on 28 June 1996 at approx. 9 a.m. Kyiv Time. Ukraine was the last of the post-Soviet states to adopt its own constitution. On Constitution Day 2018, President Petro Poroshenko remarked that the 1710 Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk is the predecessor of Ukraine&#x27;s current constitution.

In February 2019 the constitution was amended to require governments to seek European Union and NATO membership.

==Structure==
The is divided into 15 chapters:
# 
#
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

==Amendments==
In accordance with , the constitution can only be amended with the consent of no less than two-thirds of the constitutional composition (the 450 Ukrainian lawmakers) of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. In addition, amendments to Chapter I — &quot;General Principles,&quot; Chapter III — &quot;Elections. Referendum&quot;, and Chapter XIII — &quot;Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine&quot; can only be amended by the parliament of Ukraine on the condition that it is also approved by an All-Ukrainian referendum designated by the President of Ukraine. In May 2012, President Viktor Yanukovych set up the Constitutional Assembly of Ukraine; a special auxiliary agency under the President for drawing up bills of amendments to the Constitution, the president then will introduce them in parliament.

===2004 and 2010 amendments and 2014 return to 2004 amendments===

On 8 December 2004, the parliament passed Law No. 2222-IV amending the constitution. The law was approved with a 90 percent majority (402 voted in favour and 21 against, with 19 abstentions; 300 in favour required for passage) simultaneously with other legislative measures aimed at resolving the 2004 presidential election crisis. It was signed almost immediately in the parliamentary chamber by the outgoing President Leonid Kuchma and promulgated on the same day. These amendments weakened the power of the President of Ukraine, who lost the power to nominate the Prime Minister of Ukraine, which became the task of the parliament solely. The President could only appoint the Minister of Defence and Foreign Minister. The President also lost the right to dismiss members of the Cabinet of Ukraine, but gained the right to dissolve Parliament. If no coalition in parliament could be formed to appoint a Prime Minister, the President would have no choice but to call new parliamentary elections. The 2004 constitutional amendments were passed in the Parliament only with limited consultation and discussion between political forces, in the context of the Orange Revolution. They therefore attracted criticism from several internal (Ukrainian political parties) and external bodies (the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the Venice Commission).

The amendments took force unconditionally on 1 January 2006. The remaining amendments took force on 25 May 2006, when the new parliament assembled after the 2006 elections. On 1 October 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine overturned the 2004 amendments, considering them unconstitutional. The Court had started to consider the case on the political reform in 2004 under a motion from 252 coalition lawmakers regarding the constitutionality of this reform of 14 July 2010. The 2010 nullification decision was highly controversial. The Council of Europe&#x27;s Human Rights Commissioner received several reports alleging that the resignation of four judges in the run-up to the decision occurred as a result of extensive pressure by the executive. On 18 November 2010, the [[Venice Commission] published its report titled &quot;The Opinion of the Constitutional Situation in Ukraine in Review of the Judgement of Ukraine&#x27;s Constitutional Court&quot;, in which it stated: &quot;It also considers highly unusual that far-reaching constitutional amendments, including the change of the political system of the country – from a parliamentary system to a parliamentary presidential one – are declared unconstitutional by a decision of the Constitutional Court after a period of 6 years. ... As Constitutional Courts are bound by the Constitution and do not stand above it, such decisions raise important questions of democratic legitimacy and the rule of law&quot;.

On 21 February 2014, the parliament passed a law that reinstated the 8 December 2004 amendments of the constitution. This was passed under a simplified procedure, without any decision of , and was passed in the first and the second reading in one vote by 386 deputies. The law was approved by 140 MPs of the [[Party of Regions]], 89 MPs of [[Batkivshchyna]], 40 MPs of [[UDAR]], 32 of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist Party]], and 50 independent lawmakers. According to [[Radio Free Europe]], the measure was not signed by the then-President [[Viktor Yanukovych]], who was subsequently removed from office. The reinstatement of these amendments was adopted according to the 2014 [[Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine]]. This was followed shortly thereafter by the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]].

===2019 amendments===
On 7 February 2019, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] voted 334 to 17 to amend the constitution to state Ukraine&#x27;s strategic objectives as joining the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].

<text>The Cartier Railway (formerly CFC and QCM) is a privately owned railway that operates of track in the Canadian province of Québec.

It is operated by the Cartier Railway Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Arcelor Mittal, formerly Québec Cartier Mining Company.

The railway connects the company&#x27;s huge iron ore mine at Mont-Wright in Northeastern Québec with the company&#x27;s processing plant and port at Port-Cartier, formerly Shelter Bay, which is located on the northern banks of the St. Lawrence River.

The Cartier Railway has 26 locomotives, over 950 ore cars, 300 utility cars, and various other pieces of maintenance equipment.

The railway, along with other Northeastern Québec railways, including the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation line, the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway and the Arnaud Railway is completely isolated from any other railway network in North America. Although the other railways connect to each other, they do not have any direct connections to this railway, making this one completely isolated from any other railway, aside from rail ferry service via COGEMA to the CN Rail port at Matane, Quebec.

==Beginnings==
In 1958, United States Steel formed the Québec Cartier Mining Company to construct an iron-ore mine in the iron-rich Quebec-Labrador Trough, a long band which cuts through the vast Canadian Shield. Earlier exploration by mine geologists discovered a large deposit in the Trough near Lac Jeannine, about north of the small town of Shelter Bay, which was located on the northern banks of the St. Lawrence River.

In 1959, Shelter Bay, now renamed Port Cartier, was ready for use allowing easier delivery of equipment for the mine and railway, which were still under construction. Construction was completed on the railway line between Port Cartier and Lac Jeannine on December 19, 1960.

The first trainload of iron concentrate left Lac Jeannine on December 16, 1960. Concentrate was stockpiled at Port Cartier while the mine and concentrator were gearing up for full production and the first shipload of concentrate departed the port on July 5, 1961.

==Railway==
The Cartier Railway is an engineering marvel, and was constructed using all the modern, state-of-the art techniques available at the time, including making extensive use of aerial mapping to select the best route through the very mountainous terrain.

The initial rail line used natural drainage extensively by following the Rochers and Toulnustouc River valleys to keep the grades at a minimum. The ruling grade for southbound loaded trains was kept to a very easy 0.4% while the northbound ruling grade was only 1.35%.

Numerous rock cuts had to be blasted and five tunnels, ranging from , were built where rock cuts were not possible. The heavy-haul nature of this railway required all sections of its mainline, including sidings and yard tracks, to be constructed using very sturdy rail in lengths. Since curves account for 54.3% of the main line, extensive use of flange oilers was needed. The oilers were located every or 250 degrees of curvature, whichever was less.

Granite, blasted and removed during construction of the harbour at Port Cartier was crushed and used as ballast on the first of the line, while local pit-run gravel was used for the remainder. Twenty-two bridges were needed for the railway, with the bridge at Milepost 68.5 being the longest () and highest () on the line. The railway also required the construction of 1,524 culverts for drainage.

The entire line was equipped with Centralized Traffic Control from the very beginning and the railway has twelve sidings between Port-Cartier and Lac Jeannine, named in alphabetical order from south to north. The siding names are Able, Baker, Charles, Dog, Eva, Fox, Georges, Howe, Item, Jig, Kay, and Love.

All sidings are in length except for Fox which is and Love at . Since southbound loaded ore trains never enter the sidings, the south ends of each siding have power switches while the north ends have spring switches. However, both Fox and Love sidings have power switches at both ends.

==Route==
From Port-Cartier the railway runs northwest along the Aux Rochers River valley and north along the east shore of Lake Quatre Lieues before running west and then north along the MacDonald River valley beside the proposed Lake Walker National Park as far as Lac Valilée. The railway continues northwest to Lake Bourgeois, and runs northward up the east shore of this lake and then of Grand lac Caotibi, running between this lake and Lake Arthur. It then follows the east shore of Petit lac Caotibi to the Rivière Toulnustouc Nord-Est, and follows this river valley northeast and then north past Lac Cartier. Through almost all of this southern section the railway runs through the Port-Cartier–Sept-Îles Wildlife Reserve. The railway continues to follow the Rivière Toulnustouc Nord-Est north and then northwest, then runs northwest to Petit lac Manicouagan. It follows the south and west shores of this lake, crossing the Hart-Jaune Dam over the Hart Jaune River. From here it runs north of northwest across marshy terrain to Mont-Wright.
In its last section the railway runs beside Quebec Route 389.

==Initial operations and expansion==
Initial operations consisted of 150-car, 19,000 ton ore trains pulled by five diesel locomotives.

The startup fleet of locomotives consisted of nine General Motors Diesel Division GP9 locomotives and eight Montreal Locomotive Works RS-18 locomotives. A fleet of 500 ore cars was constructed by Canadian Car and Foundry.

The first full year saw 8,130,000 tons of concentrate shipped with three trainsets cycling between Lac Jeannine and Port-Cartier. Winter operations would see trains&#x27; length dropped down to as few as 90 cars with more trainsets added to keep up with production.

The railway would move an average of eight to nine million tons for the next ten years.

One of the biggest problems faced by the Cartier Railway during the winter months was keeping the concentrate from freezing to the sides of the ore cars, which could make dumping the concentrate a very slow process. The solution to this problem was to line the insides of the ore cars with styrofoam sheets which were then covered with plywood. Steam was injected into the plywood/styrofoam liner at the mine and it would keep the ore insulated until it reached the unloader at Port-Cartier.

In 1972, as the original Lac Jeannine deposit was starting to run out, the railway was extended an additional to a new ore deposit located near Mont Wright. Morrison-Knudsen was the construction company that built the extension. The new line departed the original line at Milepost 174, just north of Love Siding. This location was named South Junction by the railway. The terrain was much milder on the new extension and only five bridges needed to be constructed.

Six additional sidings were constructed and continued the alphabetical naming. These sidings are named Mike, Nan, Oboe, Pat, Queen, and Rob. Production at the Mont Wright mine was planned at 19 million tons per year, requiring additional railway equipment to handle the additional volume.

Six M636 locomotives were purchased from Montreal Locomotive Works, while Marine Industries of Sorel, Québec built 130 additional ore cars.

One of the new M636 locomotives would have an extremely short career. On May 31, 1972, M636 #72, along with GP9&#x27;s 52 and 58 and RS-18 61, ran away and derailed along with 134 ore cars on the grade, Milepost 62.4 between the sidings of Dog and Eva. Both crew members and an unauthorized passenger were killed and all units, including #72, just on its second trip, were written off and scrapped on the spot. The accident was believed to be caused by crew fatigue.

The railway suddenly found itself short of equipment again and fellow U.S. Steel railway Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie sent four of its ALCO RSD-15 locomotives to the Cartier Railway in June 1972. Two more RSD-15&#x27;s headed north in 1973. The Cartier Railway also acquired from Morrison-Knudsen three ALCO C636 demonstrators, which were used during construction of the Mont Wright extension.

Finally in 1973, the Duluth, Missabe &amp; Iron Range sent three ALCO C630 locomotives to the Cartier Railway, with 7 more arriving in 1976. These units were oddballs on the DM&amp;IR because the rest of their fleet was all Electro-Motive Division units, but they fit in very well on the Cartier Railway. Several more M636s were purchased new from MLW during 1976, as well as several acquired used from the Canadian National.

By 2002, the old ALCO and MLW locomotives were being replaced by newer General Electric AC4400CWs.

<text>Negură Bunget was a black metal band from Timișoara, Romania whose atmospheric sound incorporated elements of progressive metal and Romanian folk music.

==Biography==
Negură Bunget originally formed at the end of 1994 under the name Wiccan Rede, as a duo of Negru (Gabriel Mafa) on drums and Hupogrammos Disciple (Edmond Karban) on guitars, vocals, and keyboards. Both musicians had previously been members of Makrothumia. Wiccan Rede released one demo, 1995&#x27;s &quot;From Transilvanian Forests&quot;, before changing their name to Negură Bunget. In a 2004 interview, Negru explained the symbolism of the name: 

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Zîrnindu-să&quot;, was released in 1996. In 1997, guitarist Sol Faur (Cristian Popescu) joined the group. As a trio, they released a demo, several EPs and three more full-length albums - &quot;Măiastru Sfetnic&quot;, &quot;&#x27;N Crugu Bradului&quot; and &quot;OM&quot;.

The success of &quot;Măiastru Sfetnic&quot; (2000) secured the band a three-album contract with the Code666 label. Reaching a wider audience, they undertook their first European tours.

&quot;N Crugu Bradului&quot; (2002) included four songs spanning a total of nearly an hour. The band described the album as:

In 2006, Negură Bunget released &quot;OM&quot;, garnering significant attention from the extreme music press; for example, it was ranked as the second best album of 2006 by the writers of the British &quot;Terrorizer Magazine&quot;.

Drummer Negru (also the chief editor of the Central European ideological magazine &quot;Negura Music&quot;) began a side project, Din Brad (meaning &quot;from the fir tree&quot;), in 2008. although their first (and to date, only) album &quot;Dor&quot; was not released until 2012.

In 2009, Negură Bunget splintered due to unreconcilable disagreements between the three members. Both Hupogrammos and Sol Faur left and formed Dordeduh, while drummer Negru continued under the name of Negură Bunget with an array of new lineups.

The band&#x27;s first new album since the lineup change, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Vîrstele Pămîntului&quot;, was also released in a limited special edition version. Each of the 555 copies, handmade to order, consisted of a handcrafted, roped wooden box with a burned finish containing an undisclosed amount of genuine soil from Transylvania, a poster, pin and deluxe digipack edition of the CD itself.

Also in 2010, the band released &quot;Măiestrit&quot;, a newly rerecorded version of &quot;Măiastru Sfetnic&quot;. They released an EP, &quot;Poarta De Dincolo&quot;, in 2011, as well as &quot;Focul Viu&quot;, a live DVD and album recorded and filmed in Bucharest in January 2008 with the classic trio lineup and backing musicians.

Negru reshuffled the band&#x27;s lineup completely again in 2013. He explained the band&#x27;s structural arrangement thus: 

The band issued a two-song 7&quot; single, &quot;Gînd A-prins&quot;, in 2013.

Negură Bunget&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Tău&quot;, was announced in 2013 as the first part of a planned &quot;Transylvanian Trilogy&quot;. It was released on 27 February 2015 by Prophecy Productions sublabel Lupus Lounge.

The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Zi&quot;, was released on 30 September 2016 by Lupus Lounge.

Negru died on 21 March 2017, aged 42, leaving the band without any original members, and effectively ending the group.

On 7 December 2018, the band announced on their Facebook page that the third installment of the &quot;Transylvanian Trilogy&quot;, left unfinished following Negru&#x27;s death, was finally going to be completed and released at some point in 2019, as a tribute to Negru. With Negru&#x27;s leftover drum tracks, the remaining members worked on completing the album &quot;Zău&quot;, which was released, two years later, on November 26, 2021.

<doc id="1329588" wikidata="Q50870" url="?curid=1329588" title="WrestleMania 13">
<text>WrestleMania 13 was the 13th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). The event was presented by PlayStation and held on March 23, 1997, at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. Eight matches were held at the event, including one on the &quot;Free for All&quot; pre-show.

The main event was a no disqualification match between The Undertaker and Sycho Sid for the WWF Championship, which Undertaker won following interference from Bret Hart. The main matches on the undercard were Bret Hart versus Stone Cold Steve Austin in a No Disqualification Submission match, Legion of Doom and Ahmed Johnson versus Nation of Domination in a Chicago Street Fight, and Rocky Maivia versus The Sultan for the WWF Intercontinental Championship.

WrestleMania 13 was the second WrestleMania to take place in the Chicago metropolitan area, following WrestleMania 2. The event was attended by 18,197 who paid a total of $837,150 in admission fees, and drew a 0.77 buy rate. The event as a whole received mixed to negative reviews. However, the submission match between Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin was highly praised, being called one of the greatest matches in wrestling history, and has been cited as the beginning of the Attitude Era.

==Production==
===Background===
WrestleMania is considered the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs, along with King of the Ring. WrestleMania 13 was scheduled to be held on March 23, 1997, at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. The event was presented by PlayStation.

===Storylines===
The main feud heading into WrestleMania 13 was between The Undertaker and Sycho Sid, with the two battling over the WWF Championship. At In Your House 13 in February, Bret Hart last eliminated The Undertaker in the Final Four match to win the vacant WWF Championship. Hart&#x27;s reign, however, lasted only one day as he lost the title the next night on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; to Sycho Sid after interference by Stone Cold Steve Austin, one of the other participants in the Final Four match (the other was Vader, who had no further involvement in the ongoing storyline). Due to being the runner-up to the title at Final Four, Undertaker was made the number one contender and was booked to challenge Sycho Sid for the title at WrestleMania. However, on the March 17 edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Sid defended the title against Hart in a steel cage match, with the winner defending his title at WrestleMania. During the match, both Undertaker and Austin interfered. Undertaker came out to help Sid because he wanted to wrestle Sid for the title while Austin helped Hart because he wanted to make his scheduled submission match with Hart a title match. Sid won the match and retained his title and as a result, Sid vs. Undertaker remained the main event of WrestleMania.
The second main match on the card was Bret Hart versus Stone Cold Steve Austin in a Submission match. Hart and Austin&#x27;s rivalry began after Austin won the 1996 King of the Ring tournament and began taunting Hart, who was inactive at the time. Austin insulted Hart in his speeches so Hart would accept his challenge to a match. Hart returned in October and accepted Austin&#x27;s challenge, with the two facing each other at Survivor Series 1996 where Hart defeated Austin. Their rivalry continued as Hart and Austin were the final two participants in the 1997 Royal Rumble match. Hart had originally eliminated Austin from the match but Austin&#x27;s elimination was considered unofficial because the officials did not see it as they were busy attending to a brawl between eliminated wrestlers Mankind and Terry Funk. They were participants in a Four Corners Elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at Final Four, which Hart won. The next night on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Austin cost Hart the WWF Championship against Sycho Sid when Hart had applied the Sharpshooter on Sid, Austin nailed Hart with a steel chair followed by Sid powerbombing Hart for the win. Hart and Austin were booked to wrestle in a submission match at WrestleMania, but Hart got a shot at the WWF Championship in a steel cage match on the March 17 edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, with the winner defending the title against The Undertaker at WrestleMania 13. Hart almost had the match won, until Undertaker interfered and helped Sid in getting the victory.

One of the main undercard matches was a Chicago Street Fight featuring Ahmed Johnson and Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) against Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega). Johnson was attacked by a newcomer Faarooq Asad, a Roman gladiator on the July 22, 1996 edition of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; during a match for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Ahmed was scheduled to defend his Intercontinental Championship against Faarooq at SummerSlam 1996 but legitimate kidney problems forced him to vacate the Intercontinental Championship. In the storyline, it was explained that Faarooq had caused Ahmed&#x27;s kidney problem. Ahmed returned from his injury in early 1997 and continued with Faarooq, who had formed The Nation of Domination during Ahmed&#x27;s absence. Ahmed joined forces with the Legion of Doom and the trio were scheduled to wrestle the Nation of Domination in a Chicago Street Fight at WrestleMania 13.

==Event==
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view (PPV), Billy Gunn faced Flash Funk at Free for All. Gunn defeated Funk by pinning him following a tornado DDT.

The first match that aired on television was a Four-Way Tag Team Elimination Match. The match featured The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher), The Godwinns (Henry O. Godwinn and Phineas I. Godwinn), The New Blackjacks (Blackjack Windham and Blackjack Bradshaw) and the team of Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon. All the teams wrestled each other and sometimes in the match, teammates also fought against each other. Barry Windham and Phil LaFon brawled to the outside the ring. Bradshaw attacked the referee and got disqualified, which led to the first elimination of the match while Furnas was counted-out. Headbangers and Godwinns were the remaining teams and they battled for five minutes and 39 seconds before Thrasher hit Phineas with a Cannonball Senton and won the match via pinfall. As a result of winning the match, Headbangers earned a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship.

The second match was between Rocky Maivia and The Sultan for Maivia&#x27;s WWF Intercontinental Championship. The Honky Tonk Man provided commentary for the match. Sultan had an early advantage in the match due to his size and power but Maivia used his quicker moves to push the big man outside the ring. Sultan overpowered Maivia with slams and punches but was unable to pin him. Maivia gained advantage on Sultan by nailing him with a belly to belly suplex, Maivia Hurricane and a flying crossbody before pinning Sultan with a roll-up to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Sultan and his managers, Bob Backlund and The Iron Sheik attacked Maivia before his father, Rocky Johnson, came out to help his son.

The third match was between Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Goldust. Goldust dominated the early portion of the match. Helmsley had brief flurries of offense but Goldust had still the advantage. Helmsley began using submission maneuvers to keep the advantages for himself. Goldust was going to hit his maneuver until Helmsley&#x27;s bodyguard Chyna manhandled Goldust&#x27;s wife Marlena to distract him. Helmsley took advantage and hit Goldust with a Pedigree, enabling him to pin Goldust for the win.
The fourth match was a tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, as Owen Hart and The British Bulldog defended the titles against Mankind and Vader. The big Vader made easy work of Owen in the beginning of the match. Vader tagged in with Mankind while Owen tagged in with Bulldog. Bulldog and Mankind punched each other but Bulldog had more advantage. He applied a sleeper hold on Mankind which caused both of them to fall to the outside. They continued to brawl outside. The referee was distracted due to the brawl. Vader took advantage and hit Bulldog with Paul Bearer&#x27;s urn and dragged him into the ring. Vader and Mankind both took turns and continued to attack Bulldog. Owen tried to save his partner, but Vader used his strength while Mankind used his cheating tactics to overwhelm Owen. Mankind trapped Bulldog to the outside and applied the mandible claw on him. Both men were counted out as the match resulted in a draw. As a result, Hart and Bulldog retained the championship.

The fifth match was a No Disqualification Submission match between Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin. UFC fighter Ken Shamrock was the special guest referee for this match. Austin attacked Hart, who was still in his entrance attire. The two first beat each other in the ring before the action spilled outside the ring. Hart tossed Austin into the steel ring post while Austin drove him onto the steel barrier. The two men began fighting in the crowd, where both men hit each other with several foreign objects. They moved up the steps high into the crowd. Shamrock followed them and brought them back towards the ring where Austin attempted to use steel steps on Hart, but Hart stopped him with a kick to the midsection. As the action began in the ring, Hart focused on Austin&#x27;s leg. He busted Austin open with an Irish whip into the steel barricade and Austin&#x27;s head began to bleed profusely. Hart tried to use a steel chair on Austin&#x27;s leg, but Austin choked Hart with a television cable. Hart hit Austin in the head with the ring bell. He applied a Sharpshooter on Austin who did not submit and tried to resist but passed out from the pain and loss of blood. Shamrock awarded the match to Hart, but Hart continued to attack Austin which led to a double-turn as the fans turned on Hart and began cheering for Austin. Shamrock pulled Hart off of Austin and executed a waistlock takedown and physically challenged him to a fight. Hart declined to fight Shamrock and left the ring to a chorus of boos. Austin, meanwhile, after regaining consciousness, hit a Stunner on a referee when he tried to help Austin out, then slowly limped away to backstage, while the crowd chanted his name.

The sixth match of the event was a Chicago Street Fight between the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) and Ahmed Johnson and Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega). Both teams hit each other with many foreign objects. The match continued inside the ring and outside the ring in the same fashion. Finally, Animal hit Crush with a 2x4 and then pinned him to win the match.

===Main Event===

The main event was a No Disqualification Match between The Undertaker and reigning champion Sycho Sid for the WWF Championship. Shawn Michaels provided commentary for the match. The then-heel superstar, Bret Hart, came out during the match and insulted Undertaker, Michaels and particularly Sid because he claimed that Sid had screwed him out of the title. Sid powerbombed Hart while Undertaker took advantage and began attacking the champion from behind. Undertaker went for an Old School but Sid took him in a bearhug. Sid attacked Undertaker with various moves and attacked him with television monitors, and applied a camel clutch on Undertaker. Sid had the advantage in the match until Hart came back and attacked Sid with a steel chair. He recovered and got Undertaker in the powerbomb but Hart returned again and distracted Sid which allowed Undertaker to hit Sid with the Tombstone and pin him to win the match.

==Reception==
The event was attended by 18,197 who paid a total of $837,150 in admission fees and drew a 0.77 buy-rate.

In 2011, Marc Elusive of 411mania gave the event an overall score of 7.0 out of 10.0 and noted that &quot;The Attitude Era began here...&quot; and that the main event was &quot;a very boring match&quot;. John Canton of &quot;The John Report&quot; gave the event an overall score of 4 out of 10 and said that the show was &quot;poor&quot; and noted that the main event &quot;sucked for the first 15 minutes, but the ending was okay&quot;.

Despite the lackluster reviews towards the event, the submission match between Hart and Austin was highly praised. In 2007, it was placed #1 on IGN&#x27;s list of Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History, and described as a match that &quot;launched an era.&quot; Thomas Golianopoulos of &quot;Complex Sports&quot; also ranked it at number 1 in his list of the 50 Greatest Matches in WrestleMania History, citing the match&#x27;s six factors of storyline, innovation, psychology, finish, post-match angle, and fallout. Elusive of 411mania described the match as &quot;outstanding&quot; and &quot;that helped propel Steve Austin into the stratosphere and become the star of the late 90s and the early 00s&quot;, while also noting the double-turn after the match. John Canton called the match a &quot;wrestling perfection&quot;. It received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer and was also voted Match of the Year (1997) by readers of his &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; publication. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers named it Match of the Year (1997). The submission match would also be the last time a WrestleMania match would receive a five-star rating until WrestleMania 39 in 2023 when Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn vs Jimmy and Jey Uso on Night 1 and Gunther vs Sheamus vs Drew McIntyre on Night 2 both received the five-star rating. Hart would call it his favourite match, labeling it &quot;a real masterpiece.&quot; Ken Shamrock would call it &quot;one of the greatest matches in wrestling history&quot;, and Jim Ross called it the greatest match he&#x27;d called at WrestleMania and the most &quot;well-executed&quot; match he&#x27;d seen.

==Aftermath==
Stone Cold Steve Austin and Bret Hart continued their rivalry after WrestleMania, but Austin was now a babyface and his popularity would start to increase considerably while Hart was a heel. Hart recruited British Bulldog, Owen Hart, Brian Pillman and former tag team partner Jim Neidhart to reform The Hart Foundation. At In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker in April, Hart and Austin had a match which Austin won by disqualification. Their feud continued until In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede in July, where the Hart Foundation (working as faces in Canada) defeated the American team of Austin, Ken Shamrock, Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) and Goldust.

The Undertaker received a push after he won his second WWF Championship at WrestleMania 13. He spent a reign of 133 days which included battles with Mankind, Steve Austin, Faarooq and Vader. At SummerSlam 1997, Undertaker&#x27;s long reign finally ended when he lost the title to Bret Hart when special guest referee Shawn Michaels accidentally struck Undertaker with a steel chair, which was intended for Hart.

After losing the WWF Championship to The Undertaker at WrestleMania, Sycho Sid&#x27;s push began to diminish and after King of the Ring, he began to disappear from WWF programming. In actuality, Sid quietly left WWF to focus on recovering from a neck injury. Sid eventually returned to rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1999 and continued to wrestle as Sid Vicious until he suffered a career-ending leg injury at WCW Sin on January 14, 2001.

<text>The Eyes of Heisenberg is a 1966 science fiction novel by American writer Frank Herbert.

Originally serialized as Heisenberg&#x27;s Eyes in &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine between June and August 1966, it was issued as a book by Berkley later the same year. The title refers to Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, which the plot examines as a source of randomness both on the molecular (specifically genetic) level and on a macroscopic (anthropological) level.

==Setting==
The narrative takes places in a future in which the Earth is unified and society is rigidly stratified into two genetic and reproductive classes: the &quot;Optimen&quot; (a ruling class of genetically superior humans, who include women) and the &quot;Folk.&quot; All humans are mandatorily genetically reviewed and modified (&quot;cut&quot;) shortly after conception.

The Optimen, who are distinguished by genetic excellence and exercise absolute dictatorial control over Earth from an enclave in North America, hold global society in stasis, both politically and through continuous manipulation of the human genome. They are self-selected; their metabolism responds to the life-extension enzymes available to all members of society - which normally increase lifespan to around 400 years - by inducing true biological immortality. Only a small minority of the Folk is permitted to reproduce, and that only under strict supervision—the vast majority are &quot;Sterries,&quot; kept sterile through an ever-present prophylactic gas. The Optimen are naturally sterile.

The Folk revere the Optimen with a quasi-religious fervor, centered on the mantra &quot;They are the power that loves us and protects us.&quot; The adulation is however not universal; an anti-Optiman resistance exists, in the form of the &quot;Parents Underground&quot; and the &quot;Couriers,&quot; both networks sponsored by the Cyborgs, mechanically-enhanced humans who had lost a war for control of Earth to the Optimen in the distant past. As the story unfolds, the setting — which had seemed a relatively near future, perhaps a few centuries at most — is revealed to be at least 80,000 years in the future (that being the age given for the oldest of the Optimen). The extraordinary social control of the Optimen - who have deliberately stunted technological progress - is such that culture is largely indistinguishable from that of the late 21st century. The Cyborgs themselves contribute to the stasis, being extremely long-lived themselves — the Optiman-Cyborg War is implied to have taken place in the extremally distant past, but also no more than three Cyborg generations ago.

Most of the book takes place in the &quot;Seatac Megalopolis&quot;—apparently incorporating present-day Seattle and Tacoma — and the Optiman enclave in the Great Lakes region.

==Plot==

Harvey and Lizbeth Durant arrive to witness the &quot;cutting&quot; of their embryo. Svengaard, a low-ranking doctor, tries to convince them to not view the procedure, but they are adamant and insist on their right, all the while secretly communicating their contempt for Svengaard in a silent Courier code. Potter, a high-ranking surgeon, arrives to perform the cut. During the procedure, he is shocked to discover that the embryo has qualities not seen in millennia; superior genetics in the areas of intelligence, plus vocation for immortality and full fertility. Obligated to destroy it, Potter is surprised to find himself unwilling to do so, aided by the on-the-spot collusion of one of the nurses who sabotages the record of the operation.

Allgood, Boumard and Igan arrive at the Hall of Counsel for an audience with the Tuyere after Tachy-Security monitoring detects something suspicious during the Durant embryo &quot;cutting.&quot; The nurse has been arrested, but has died under interrogation. The Optimen triumvirate of Calapine, Nourse and Schruille playfully mock their subordinates, but with a faint undercurrent of menace. Calapine flirts with Allgood in a semi-bemused fashion. The Tuyere order that Svengaard be brought before them. Boumard and Igan are revealed to the reader as Cyborg agents. Svengaard is interrogated by the Tuyere; badly frightened, he fumbles and grows agitated under their mockery, becoming borderline insubordinate. The Tuyere calm him down with a display of magnanimity, reminding him of their power, wisdom and seniority.

In a service area under the Seatac Megalopolis, the Durants have gone into hiding. They meet with the cyborg Glisson, who informs them of events, tells them that a strange external force had (beneficially) interfered with the cutting process of their embryo, and orders them to stay put. The Durants chafe under its unfeeling, domineering manner, hoping to one another to one day be free of the Optimen &quot;and&quot; Cyborgs. They scheme to deliver their baby the unheard-of natural way, and keep it out of reach of both factions. They wonder if the interfering power might be God.

Svengaard detects activity in the hospital vat room, where the embryo is kept. Investigating, he is rendered unconscious and abducted from under the nose of Allgood&#x27;s surveillance. Potter is escorted through the streets of Seatac by a resistance agent. Near their destination, they are intercepted by security forces. Potter&#x27;s escort sends him ahead, revealing itself as a combat cyborg and decimating the pursuers until it is destroyed. Potter is spirited away by the resistance. The Tuyere—and many other Optimen—watch the battle live, the long-unfamiliar thrill of violence awakening odd sensations in them.

In a resistance safehouse, Igan tries to recruit a recalcitrant Svengaard. Failing, he and Boumard sedate him and make plans to evacuate Seatac, which they suspect the Optimen are about to genocidally purge of all life. The Durants, Boumard and Igan (their cover blown) and a gagged Svengaard are moved out of Seatac in a hover-truck driven by a cyborg, later revealed to be Glisson. At a checkpoint, Svengaard cries out briefly, causing them to be traced. Glisson changes their destination.

The Tuyere wipe out the population of Seatac through a combination of poison gas and sonic weapons. They find themselves surprised by their unstable emotional reactions to the event. The occupants of the truck observe the destruction of Seatac; Svengaard&#x27;s faith in the Optimen is badly shaken. The Durants notice that Boumard and Igan are in the early stages of cyborgization. The truck proceeds to a ramshackle safehouse in the forest.

The Tuyere receives a field report from Allgood. Calapine, growing suspicious of his behavior, scans him with her instruments, discovering that he has accepted Cyborg implants. Enraged, she kills him remotely. Calapine and Schruille decide to henceforth run Tachy-Security themselves, finding themselves oddly stimulated by the prospect of an even more active involvement in violence. Potter is revealed to have died offstage in Seatac. Calapine and Nourse both require treatment for enzyme imbalance. The occupants of the cabin decide that the apathetic Svengaard cannot be trusted, and should be killed. Harvey asks him if he wants to live; Svengaard suddenly finds that he does. He offers to care for the Durant&#x27;s child, an offer Harvey accepts as he does not trust Boumard and Igan. The security forces of the Optimen surround the house and disarm (literally) Glisson.

The Tuyere debate what to do with the prisoners. They speculate that, if the infection of viability spreads, wiping out all the Folk and starting over would not be out of the question. They decide to have the prisoners brought before themselves for interrogation. A full assembly of Optimen meet in the Hall of Counsel. The prisoners are brought in, immobilized in a solid block of transparent plastic. The assembled Optimen begin to feel odd emotions, which spiral into greater and greater instability. Glisson asserts that reintroducing them to firsthand violence had been a Cyborg ploy to destabilize the delicate equilibrium of the Optiman mind, and that the Cyborgs have won. A semi-hysterical Calapine converses with the prisoners, verges on killing them, then abruptly releases them instead. The Optimen descend into insanity; several, including Schruille, are killed in a stampede. The former prisoners try to help.

Calapine and the former prisoners discuss the new status quo. Glisson&#x27;s gloating is cut off when a biological solution is proposed: Svengaard believes that he will be able to stabilize the Optimen, and introduce the beneficial mutations of the Durant embryo on a wide scale, giving the Folk a lifespan of at least 12,000 to 15,000 years—longevity without the pernicious ossification of immortality. The novel concludes on a note of guarded optimism.

==Themes==

Continuing a theme present in many of Herbert&#x27;s other works, the novel is principally concerned with the problems inherent in or caused by the inflexibility of a static system. The Durants find themselves a cog in the high-level machinations of competing factions, none of which have their own best interests at heart.

A number of Herbert&#x27;s other common themes pop up, including his interest in complex, rigidly codified or ritualized behaviors, reflected in the precise etiquette expected of those granted an audience with the Tuyere. Herbert&#x27;s interest in exotic forms of communication takes the shape of the secret language of the Couriers, conveyed through subtle palm pressures during handholding. The longevity of the Optimen prefigures Leto II of the &quot;Dune&quot; saga.

==Reception==
David Pringle rated &quot;The Eyes of Heisenberg&quot; two stars out of four. Pringle described the book as &quot;a provocative novel of ideas written in this author&#x27;s usual style&quot;.

<text>Madhur Jaffrey CBE (née Bahadur; born 13 August 1933) is an Indian-born British-American actress, cookbook and travel writer, and television personality. She is recognized for bringing Indian cuisine to the western hemisphere with her debut cookbook, &quot;An Invitation to Indian Cooking&quot; (1973), which was inducted into the James Beard Foundation&#x27;s Cookbook Hall of Fame in 2006. She has written over a dozen cookbooks and appeared on several related television programmes, the most notable of which was &quot;Madhur Jaffrey&#x27;s Indian Cookery&quot;, which premiered in the UK in 1982. She was the food consultant at the now-closed &quot;Dawat&quot;, which was considered by many food critics to be among the best Indian restaurants in New York City.

She was instrumental in bringing together filmmakers James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, and acted in several of their films, such as &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965), for which she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award at the 15th Berlin International Film Festival. She has appeared in dramas on radio, stage and television.

In 2004, she was named an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in recognition of her services to cultural relations between the United Kingdom, India and the United States, through her achievements in film, television and cookery. In 2022, she was awarded the Padma Bhushan from the Government of India, which is the third highest civilian award.

Her childhood memoir of India during the final years of the British Raj, &quot;Climbing the Mango Trees&quot;, was published in 2006.

== Early life ==
Jaffrey was born in Civil Lines, Delhi, into a Mathur Kayastha Hindu joint family. She is the fifth of six children of Lala Raj Bans Bahadur (1899–1974) and his wife, Kashmiran Rani (1903–1971). Jaffrey&#x27;s grandfather, Rai Bahadur Raj Narain (1864–1950), had built a sprawling family compound, named Number 7 Raj Narain Marg, by the Yamuna river amid fruit orchards.

When Jaffrey was about two years old, her father accepted a position in a family-run concern, Ganesh Flour Mills, and moved to Kanpur as the manager of a &quot;vanaspati ghee&quot; factory there. In Kanpur, Jaffrey attended St. Mary&#x27;s Convent School along with her elder sisters, Lalit and Kamal. In kindergarten at the age of five, she played the role of the brown mouse in a musical version of the &quot;Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;. The family lived in Kanpur for eight years, until her grandfather&#x27;s deteriorating health caused a move back to Delhi in 1944.

In Delhi, Jaffrey attended Queen Mary&#x27;s Higher Secondary School where her history teacher, Mrs McKelvie, encouraged her to participate in school plays. Jaffrey played the role of Titania in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; followed by the lead role in &quot;Robin Hood and His Merry Men&quot;. Jaffrey&#x27;s brothers, Brij Bans Bahadur and Krishen Bans Bahadur, who were much older than her, were enrolled in St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi. Every winter, St. Stephen&#x27;s students put on a Shakespearean play that Jaffrey would watch avidly from the front row.

A supporter of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s demand for Indian independence from British rule, Jaffrey spent some time each day spinning &quot;khadi&quot; and delivered several large spools of thread to a central collection center in Delhi.

In 1947, Jaffrey experienced first-hand the effects of the partition of India. At school, her classmates split into two on the issue of partition; the Muslim girls supported the idea while the Hindus were against it. On 15 August she watched the transfer of power at India Gate and got a clear glimpse of Jawaharlal Nehru and Lord Mountbatten coming down Rajpath in an open horse carriage. The massive multi-directional migration that began almost immediately afterwards caused riots and killing in Delhi. The male members of her family guarded their house with guns that they had previously used only for hunting game. At school, all her Muslim classmates left without a farewell. In 1948, a few days before Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead, she attended one of his prayer meetings at Birla House and sang bhajans. She heard the news of his assassination on the radio, followed by Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s address later that night, &quot;the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere.&quot; She saw Gandhi&#x27;s funeral procession at Rajpath and witnessed his cremation at Rajghat.

At home, Jaffrey&#x27;s family primarily ate food prepared by servants but supervised by the women of the family. They occasionally indulged in Mughlai cuisine bought in the bylanes of Old Delhi, like &quot;bedmi aloo&quot;, &quot;seekh kebab&quot;, &quot;shami kebab&quot;, &quot;rumali roti&quot; and &quot;bakarkhani&quot;. Refugees from Punjab who settled in Delhi after partition brought their own style of cooking. Moti Mahal, a &quot;dhaba&quot; in Daryaganj, introduced &quot;tandoori chicken&quot; and then went on to invent butter chicken and &quot;dal makhani&quot;. Jaffrey found Punjabi food&#x27;s simplicity and freshness very enticing and routinely picked up tandoori food from Moti Mahal for family picnics.

At school, the subject of domestic science included learning dishes like blancmange, whose bland taste drove Jaffrey to dismiss the cookery lessons as preparing &quot;British invalid foods from circa 1930&quot;. However, at the time of the practical examination, her class was asked to make a dish from an assortment of potatoes, tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger and Indian spices in a pot over wood to be lit with matches. Jaffrey did her best but guessed that she failed the subject of domestic science altogether.

Jaffrey and her cousins would regularly answer summons from the nearby All India Radio station for parts in radio plays or children&#x27;s programs. As she was paid a small fee for each session, Jaffrey considered this to be her first professional work.
Meanwhile, Jaffrey&#x27;s father had moved to Daurala as general manager of Daurala Sugar Works, a factory owned by family friends, the Shri Ram family. Jaffrey, along with her brothers, her younger sister, Veena, and her mother remained behind in Delhi in to avoid disrupting the children&#x27;s education. During this period, Jaffrey&#x27;s elder sisters were at boarding school in Nainital. In the letters that they exchanged with their siblings and cousins at Delhi, they addressed each other only by their initials. This tradition cemented over time so that Jaffrey became &quot;M&quot; for her circle of close friends and family. Jaffrey&#x27;s father eventually returned from Daurala and joined Delhi Cloth Mills, a textile factory owned by the Shri Ram family.

== Delhi (1950–1955) ==
From 1950 to 1953, Jaffrey attended Miranda House, a women&#x27;s college, where she gained a B.A. degree in English Honours with a minor in philosophy. 

She took part in her college&#x27;s all-women productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. She appeared in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; performed by St. Stephen&#x27;s College.

In 1951, Jaffrey joined the Unity Theatre, an English language repertory company founded by Saeed Jaffrey in New Delhi. She auditioned for the role of the Queen&#x27;s Reader in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s play &quot;The Eagle Has Two Heads&quot; just four days before the opening and was cast in the role. The next play that she did with Saeed was Christopher Fry&#x27;s &quot;A Phoenix Too Frequent&quot;.

After graduation from Miranda House in 1953, Jaffrey joined All India Radio, where Saeed Jaffrey was an announcer. She worked as a disc jockey at night. Saeed and Jaffrey fell in love, and dated at Gaylord, a restaurant in Connaught Place.

During this period, Jaffrey also met Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, a British novelist who had moved to Civil Lines, Delhi, after marriage to Cyrus Jhabvala, an Indian architect, in 1951. Jaffrey answered a casting call by Prawer Jhabvala and worked with her on All India Radio plays. The protagonists of Prawer Jhabvala&#x27;s first novel, &quot;To Whom She Will&quot; (1955), a young couple who work at a radio station in Delhi and fall in love, were based on Madhur and Saeed Jaffrey. The novel was published in America the following year as &quot;Amrita&quot; (1956).

In early 1955, Jaffrey was in the audience at St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi, for a programme of literary readings by Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson, married English actors who toured internationally in Shakespearean productions. Later that year, the &quot;Unity Theatre&quot; put on a performance of Tennessee Williams&#x27; one-act play, &quot;Auto-da-Fé&quot;, in which Jaffrey played the rigidly moralistic mother to Saeed&#x27;s young postal worker, Eloi. The last play that Jaffrey did with Saeed was &quot;Othello&quot; in which Saeed was cast as Iago while Jaffrey played Iago&#x27;s wife, Emilia.

Jaffrey decided to pursue acting as a profession. She won a grant from the British government that she could use to pay for education at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).

The head of the British Council in India was impressed by her performance in &quot;Auto-da-Fé&quot; and offered her a scholarship. Armed with these two sources of money, Jaffrey arrived at Southampton on 6 December 1955 on the P&amp;O liner from Bombay.

== London (1955–1957) ==
Jaffrey joined the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) with Diana Rigg, Siân Phillips and Glenda Jackson as her contemporaries. She won a scholarship from RADA after an audition. This supplemented her earlier grant and scholarship. She also picked up minor acting roles on BBC television and radio. Her father would send her a small amount of money periodically and her total income proved sufficient to live modestly in London. She rented rooms from at least two different landlords before settling down in a bedsit in Brent with a young Jewish family, the Golds, who allowed her to use their kitchen and their utensils to cook her own food. Her landlady, Blanche Gold, was roughly her age. Blanche had one child and was pregnant.

Jaffrey found British food and Indian restaurants of that time to be terrible. The grey roast beef and overcooked cabbage with watery potatoes served at the fifth-floor canteen of RADA were unappetizing. She wrote to her mother, begging her for recipes of the home cooked meals of her childhood. Her mother responded with recipes written in Hindi on onionskin paper in letters sent via airmail. The very first letter was dated 19 March 1956 and included recipes for meat spiced with cinnamon, cardamom and bay, a cauliflower dish, and egg curry with hard-boiled eggs. The first recipe that she tried was jeera aloo (potatoes with cumin). She bought pumpernickel from a neighborhood Jewish bakery as a substitute for chapatis.

In late 1955, Saeed Jaffrey won a Fulbright scholarship to study drama in America the following year. In spring 1956, he approached Jaffrey&#x27;s parents in Delhi for her hand in marriage but they refused because they felt that his financial prospects as an actor did not appear sound. Jaffrey got her father&#x27;s permission to marry Saeed eventually. In summer 1956, Saeed flew to London on his way to America and proposed to Jaffrey. She refused but gave him a tour of RADA where she pointed out English actors, such as Peter O&#x27;Toole, whom she thought would soon have a high profile in the profession. Soon afterwards, Saeed boarded the to sail across the Atlantic Ocean from Southampton to New York City.

In 1957 Jaffrey graduated from RADA with honours. Not knowing whether to stay on in London, join a repertory company or go back to India, she wrote to Saeed describing her dilemma. Saeed had just graduated from Catholic University of America&#x27;s Department of Speech and Drama and had been selected to act in summer stock plays at St. Michael&#x27;s Playhouse in Winooski, Vermont. Seeing Saeed troubled by Jaffrey&#x27;s letter, Reverend Gilbert V. Hartke, the department head at Catholic University, arranged for Jaffrey to teach pantomime at St. Michael&#x27;s Playhouse at Winooski that summer. Father Hartke also arranged for her to go to Catholic University on a partial scholarship and work at the Drama School library in order to meet her living expenses. After gaining her American work visa, Jaffrey sailed across the Atlantic on the to join Saeed at Winooski.

== New York City (1958–1969) ==
In September 1957 Jaffrey stayed in Washington, D.C., with Saeed, who had returned there to rehearse for the 1957–58 season with the National Players, a professional touring company that performed classical plays all over America. Midway through the tour, Saeed returned to Washington, D.C. from Miami to marry Jaffrey in a modest civil ceremony. The next day, they travelled to New York City where Jaffrey got a job as a tour guide to the United Nations, while Saeed did public relations work for the Government of India Tourist Office. Between 1959 and 1963, Jaffrey and Saeed had three daughters: Meera, Zia and Sakina.

In September 1958, Ismail Merchant arrived from Bombay to attend the New York University Stern School of Business. Merchant had heard of Saeed from his theater days in Delhi. He himself wanted to produce plays and make movies. Saeed was then playing the lead at Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio in an Off-Broadway production of &quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, a tragedy by Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. Merchant approached Saeed with a proposal to put on a Broadway production of &quot;The Little Clay Cart&quot;, starring the Jaffreys. Saeed took him home for dinner, where he met Jaffrey, who was heavily pregnant with the Jaffreys&#x27; first child.

The following year, James Ivory, then an emerging film maker from California, approached Saeed Jaffrey to provide the narration for his short film about Indian miniature painting, &quot;The Sword and the Flute&quot; (1959). Saeed brought Ivory home for dinner and introduced him to Jaffrey. When &quot;The Sword and the Flute&quot; screened in New York City in 1961, the Jaffreys encouraged Merchant to attend the screening, where he met Ivory for the first time. They subsequently met regularly at the Jaffreys&#x27; dinners and cemented their relationship into a lifetime partnership, both personal and professional. The Jaffreys planned to go back to India, start a travelling company and tour with it. They would often discuss this idea with James Ivory and started writing a script in his brownstone on East 64th Street.

The Jaffreys soon expanded their social circle to include other members of the Indian community in New York City who were involved in the arts. They regularly hosted large dinners cooked by Jaffrey, who was determined to master everything, including biryani and pulao.

In 1962, Jaffrey and Saeed appeared in Rolf Forsberg&#x27;s Off-Broadway production of &quot;A Tenth of an Inch Makes The Difference&quot;. Their performance was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic, Milton Esterow, as &quot;sensitive acting&quot; that made up &quot;the brightest part of the evening&quot;. The pay for such roles was generally $10/hour.

By 1965, the Jaffreys&#x27; marriage had collapsed. Jaffrey arranged for their children to live with her parents and sister in Delhi while Jaffrey went to Mexico for the formal divorce proceedings. The divorce was finalized in 1966.

Jaffrey visited to India for the shooting of &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965). After the film&#x27;s shooting was complete, she lived in India with her children until Ismail Merchant decided that she needed to be at the Berlin International Film Festival because he had entered the film in competition there. In Berlin, she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award. Sanford Allen, a violinist she had met when she was a guide at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, sent her a bunch of roses on her win. Jaffrey returned to New York City when the film was screened at the New York Film Festival. She and Sanford Allen met again and decided to pursue a relationship seriously.

In 1966 Ismail Merchant, in search of further publicity for the film, decided to cultivate &quot;The New York Times&quot; food critic Craig Claiborne. He persuaded Claiborne to profile Jaffrey as an actress who could also cook. When Claiborne agreed, Jaffrey borrowed a friend&#x27;s apartment in which to meet him since she felt she could not do so in the one-bedroom apartment on Eleventh Street that she shared with Allen. She rearranged the furniture in the borrowed apartment and made stuffed green peppers, koftas in sour cream and cucumber raita. 
In 1967, Jaffrey traveled to India to attend a black-tie premiere of &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; in Delhi hosted by the British High Commissioner to India, John Freeman and his wife, Catherine. At the premiere she met Marlon Brando, an actor Jaffrey admired deeply for his method acting technique. Brando was in India to raise money for UNICEF and the film premiere also served as a fund-raiser. Later that year, Jaffrey shot scenes for Merchant Ivory&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Guru&quot; (1969). She returned from India with her children. The family, along with Sanford Allen, moved into a 14th-floor apartment in a Greenwich Village co-op. In order to better provide for her children, she became a freelance writer for food and travel magazines, covering subjects as diverse as paintings, music, dance, drama, sculpture, and architecture.

In 1969, Jaffrey married Sanford Allen, who at the time was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

==Merchant Ivory films==
Jaffrey was instrumental in introducing James Ivory and Ismail Merchant to each other.

When Merchant and Ivory went to India to make &quot;The Householder&quot; (1963) they met Shashi Kapoor and his in-laws, the Kendals. Geoffrey Kendal and his wife, Laura Liddell, had a traveling theatre company, &quot;Shakespeareana&quot;, that performed plays by Shakespeare pan India. Combining the Jaffreys&#x27; original idea with the real-life &quot;Shakespeareana&quot;, Merchant and Ivory came up with their next film &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965). Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was persuaded to write a movie star role for Jaffrey. Saeed was dropped from the project because the Jaffreys&#x27; marriage had collapsed at this point.

When Jaffrey travelled to India for the shooting of &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot;, her first shots were in Kasauli, a hill station. The hairpin bends on the drive there caused her nausea and vomiting, leading the crew to despair that a person so petite and sickly could ever play a glamorous film star. Kenneth Tynan, a film critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;, described her performance as &quot;a ravishing study in felinity&quot;.

She went on to act in further Merchant Ivory films like &quot;The Guru&quot; (1969), &quot;Autobiography of a Princess&quot; (1976), &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983), directed by Ivory, and &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot; (1988). She starred as the title character in their film &quot;Cotton Mary&quot; (1999) and co-directed it with Merchant.

==Other films and television==
Jaffrey has appeared in &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993), &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; (1994), &quot;Flawless&quot; (1999) and &quot;Prime&quot; (2005). She starred in and produced &quot;ABCD&quot; (1999) and guest-starred in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Name&quot; as a psychiatrist, and the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;The Healer&quot; as a lecturer. In the 2009 &quot;Psych&quot; episode &quot;Bollywood Homicide,&quot; Jaffrey played an Indian grandmother whose food is too spicy for the main characters to handle. In 1985, she was in the Hindi film &quot;Saagar&quot; where she played the role of Kamladevi, Rishi Kapoor&#x27;s grandmother. In 1992–94, she appeared with Billie Whitelaw in the British television series &quot;Firm Friends&quot;. In 1999, she appeared with daughter Sakina Jaffrey in the film &quot;Chutney Popcorn&quot;. In &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; (2003), a film broadcast on PBS, she played a traditional Hindu wife who suddenly leaves her husband. She also starred alongside Deborah Kerr in the 1985 movie &quot;The Assam Garden&quot;. In 2009, she appeared with Aasif Mandvi in &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot;, adapted from Mandvi&#x27;s play about a celebrated sous chef who is forced to run his father&#x27;s tandoori restaurant in Queens. In 2012, she played a doctor in &quot;A Late Quartet&quot; who diagnoses Christopher Walken&#x27;s character with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She appeared as the older version of the Indian super heroine character Celsius, in her civilian identity Arani Desai, in a 2019 episode of the DC Universe series &quot; Doom Patrol&quot;.

==Theatre==
In 1962, she appeared in &quot;A Tenth of an Inch Makes the Difference&quot; by Rolf Forsberg. In 1969, she appeared in &quot;The Guide&quot;, based on the novel by R. K. Narayan, and in 1970, she appeared in &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot;, written by Barry England. In 1993, she appeared in &quot;Two Rooms&quot; by Lee Blessing.
In 1999, she appeared in &quot;Last Dance at Dum Dum&quot; by Ayub Khan-Din. In 2004, Jaffrey appeared in &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot; on Broadway, where she played the main character&#x27;s grandmother (Shanti). In 2005, she appeared in &quot;India Awakening&quot; by Anne Marie Cummings.

==Cooking==
Jaffrey is the author of cookbooks of Indian, Asian, and world vegetarian cuisines. Many have become best-sellers; some have won James Beard Foundation awards. She has presented a cooking series on television, including &quot;Madhur Jaffrey&#x27;s Indian Cookery&quot; in 1982, &quot;Madhur Jaffrey&#x27;s Far Eastern Cookery&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Madhur Jaffrey&#x27;s Flavours of India&quot; in 1995. She lives in Manhattan and has a home in upstate New York. As a result of the success of her cookbooks and TV, Jaffrey developed a line of mass-marketed cooking sauces.

Ironically, she did not cook at all as a child growing up in Delhi. She had almost never been in the kitchen and almost failed cooking at school. It was only after she went to London at the age of 19 to study at RADA that she learned how to cook, using recipes of familiar dishes that were provided in correspondence from her mother. Her editor Judith Jones claimed in her memoirs that Jaffrey was an ideal cookbook writer precisely because she had learned to cook childhood comfort food as an adult, and primarily from written instructions. In the 1960s, after her award-winning performance in &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot;, she became known as the &quot;actress who could cook&quot;.

After an article about her and her cooking appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1966, she received a book contract from an independent editor to write a book on Indian cooking. Jaffrey started compiling all the recipes learnt by her through correspondence with her mother and adapted for the American kitchen. Due to a period of rapid consolidation in the American publishing industry, the book went to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich but got no attention there either. Jaffrey took the book to her friend, Ved Mehta, who in turn mentioned it to publisher André Schiffrin. Schiffrin passed on the book to Knopf editor Judith Jones, who had championed Julia Child&#x27;s cookbook at a time when no other publisher would touch it. Judith Jones snapped up the book immediately, only asking Jaffrey to add serving suggestions and menus for people not familiar with Indian cooking. In 1973 &quot;An Invitation to Indian Cooking&quot; was published, Jaffrey&#x27;s first cookbook. During the 1970s, she taught classes in Indian cooking, both at the James A. Beard School of Cooking and in her Manhattan apartment. She was hired by the BBC to present a show on Indian cooking. In 1986, the restaurant Dawat opened in Manhattan using recipes that she provided.

The social historian Panikos Panayi described her as the doyen of Indian cookery writers, but noted that their and her influence remained limited to Indian cuisine. Panayi commented that despite Jaffrey&#x27;s description of &quot;most Indian restaurants in Britain as &#x27;second-class establishments that had managed to underplay their own regional uniqueness, most of her dishes too &quot;do not appear on dining tables in India&quot;.

Steve Kenson was working on &quot;Silver Age Sentinels&quot; and pitched Freedom City as a setting for the game, but the game&#x27;s publishers, Guardians of Order, turned it down. Chris Pramas of Green Ronin Publishing asked Kenson to design a superhero role-playing game using the D20 System, so Kenson developed &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; in 2002 in part to get his &quot;Freedom City&quot; setting published, which ultimately happened in 2003. Green Ronin published a trio of books to develop Freedom City through three different eras of comic books, &quot;Golden Age&quot; (2006), &quot;Iron Age&quot; (2007) and &quot;Silver Age&quot; (2010). Starting in 2008, a series of &quot;Freedom City Atlases&quot; made an expansion to the Freedom City setting. A new third edition of &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds Hero&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2011) established a new setting in the game universe, Emerald City, which debuted in a series of PDF &quot;Threat Reports&quot; (2011), while a full setting book was planned for release at GenCon 44. Lastly, a third edition &quot;Freedom City&quot; book was published in October 2017, which advances the timeline and introduces new characters while retiring others.

==Reception==
&quot;Freedom City&quot; won the 2003 Silver Ennie Award for &quot;Best Art, Interior&quot;, &quot;Best Graphic Design and Layout&quot;, and &quot;Best Campaign Setting&quot;.

&quot;Freedom City&quot; won the 2006 Gold Ennie Award for &quot;Best Campaign Setting/Setting Supplement&quot;.

<text>Point-to-Point Protocol daemon (PPPD) is the daemon that implements Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). PPP is used to manage network connections between two nodes on Unix-like operating systems. It is configured using command-line arguments and configuration files.

While it has initially been used to manage only dial-up access, it is also used to manage broadband connections such as DSL, if Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) or Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) is used.

The role of pppd is managing PPP session establishment and session termination. 
During session establishment, pppd has the role of:
* Looped link detection: PPP detects looped links using magic numbers. When PPPD sends PPP LCP messages, these messages include a magic number. If a line is looped, the node receives an LCP message with its own magic number, instead of getting a message with the peer&#x27;s magic number.
*Automatic self configuration: Using Link Control Protocol it has to negotiate protocol features like Address-and-Control-Field-Compression (ACFC), escaped characters, and the compression, encryption (like MPPE) and authentication methods to use.
*Access control and authentication: Using protocols like Challenge-handshake authentication protocol (CHAP) or Password authentication protocol (PAP) it has to provide and check authentication data.
*Layer 3 configuration: If using Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP), it will negotiate or determine IP parameters such as the IP addresses, the maximum transmission unit, and name server addresses. Some versions may also support Internetwork Packet Exchange Control Protocol (IPXCP) and AppleTalk Control Protocol (ATCP) for routing IPX or AppleTalk over the link.
*After negotiation is complete, it has to set up the required network interfaces and routes, so that the connection is run by the kernel.

pppd terminates a PPP link when:
* too many frames with invalid frame check sequence (FCS) field have been received
* the link is considered &quot;idle&quot; (if configured)
* another program or the peer requests link termination.

Some newer versions of pppd are also capable of handling Dial-on-demand routing, where pppd sets up a virtual network, captures the packages it receives and establishes a PPP connection and forwards the captured and not-yet transmitted packages over the link.

==Frontends and configurators==
* kppp – A kde GUI frontend for pppd.
* gnome-ppp – A (discontinued) gnome GUI frontend for WvDial, which in turns depends on pppd.
* pppconfig – It uses the standard ppp configuration files and sets ppp up so that the standard pon and poff commands (to connect and disconnect) and plog (to list the log) can be used to control ppp. It includes modem detection.
* WvDial – A CLI tool which is used for modem initialisation before starting pppd.

<text>Bayswater Road is the main road running along the northern edge of Hyde Park in London. Originally part of the A40 road, it is now designated part of the A402 road.

==Route==
In the east, Bayswater Road originates at Marble Arch roadway at the Marble Arch junction, and at its western end it continues into Notting Hill Gate. It is mostly within the City of Westminster but a small portion of the road&#x27;s western end lies in Kensington and Chelsea.

==History==
The road is part of the Via Trinobantia, an old Roman Road, later becoming a turnpike road. Trinobantia in latin translates to Trinity. It had become known as Bayswater Road by the 1860s. The Swan Inn and Black Lion are both on Bayswater Road and were both established in the 18th century. In 1861, George Francis Train experimented with a horse tramway system on Bayswater Road. 

Since February 2023, the western end of Bayswater Road has had the joint official name of Kyiv Road, done by Westminster Council as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine the previous year, as this section of the road runs close to the Russian Embassy. However, the renaming does not apply to addresses on the road, as they have historically been addressed as part of the adjacent street.

==Cultural references==
J. M. Barrie lived at No. 100 Bayswater Road from 1902 to 1909, where he wrote &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. The street is where the fictional upper-middle class Forsyte family live in John Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;.

The Bayswater Road Art Show takes place every Sunday. It is the largest regular open-air art exhibition in the world.

==Notable sites==
*Tyburn Convent
**Building № 10, London&#x27;s &quot;smallest house&quot; which is sandwiched between buildings №9 and №11. Buildings №9 and №10 are both owned by the Tyburn Convent.
*St George&#x27;s Fields
*Royal Lancaster Hotel
*Bayswater Road Sunday Art Exhibition, at which over 250 artists exhibit original art on the Royal Park Railings between Lancaster Gate and Queensway tube stations every Sunday.
*The Embassy of the Czech Republic is located at the junction with Kensington Palace Gardens
*The High Commission of Guyana located opposite the Embassy of Russia
*Park Modern

==Transport==
Lancaster Gate and Queensway stations (both on the London Underground&#x27;s Central line) are located on Bayswater Road. Bayswater tube station is located near Queensway station and is on the Circle and District Lines.

London bus routes 94 and 148 run along the whole length of Bayswater Road. Bus route 274 starts at Lancaster Gate station in the road and serves the eastern part, while bus route 70 serves the western end.

<doc id="1329630" wikidata="Q447669" url="?curid=1329630" title="Philip Baker Hall">
<text>Philip Baker Hall (September 10, 1931 – June 12, 2022) was an American character actor. He is known for his collaborations with Paul Thomas Anderson, including &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996), &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), and &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999). He also starred in leading roles in films, such as &quot;Secret Honor&quot; (1984) and &quot;Duck&quot; (2005). Hall had supporting roles in many films, including &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988), &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999), &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000), &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003), &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), &quot;50/50&quot; (2011), and &quot;Argo&quot; (2012). He received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead for his role in &quot;Hard Eight&quot; and two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture for &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

Hall is also known for his prolific work on television. His early television work included &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and &quot;Cheers&quot;. One of his most memorable television roles was as Lt. Joe Bookman, the &quot;library cop&quot;, in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. He had recurring roles in &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, and &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;.

==Early life==
Hall was born in Toledo, Ohio. His mother was Alice Birdene (née McDonald), and his father, William Alexander Hall, was a factory worker from Montgomery, Alabama. He attended the University of Toledo. He served in Germany as a United States Army translator and as a high school teacher.

==Career==
After his film debut &quot;Cowards&quot;, he joined the Los Angeles Theatre Center. His first television role came for an episode of &quot;Good Times&quot;. Hall guest starred in episodes of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;. He had over 200 guest roles since 1977. He played Richard Nixon in the one-character film &quot;Secret Honor&quot; and reprised his role he had created during the play&#x27;s original Off-Broadway run. Roger Ebert said about Hall and the film: &quot;Nixon is portrayed by Philip Baker Hall, an actor previously unknown to me, with such savage intensity, such passion, such venom, such scandal, that we cannot turn away. Hall looks a little like the real Nixon; he could be a cousin, and he sounds a little like him. That&#x27;s close enough. This is not an impersonation, it&#x27;s a performance.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised Hall&#x27;s &quot;immense performance, which is as astonishing and risky ― for the chances the actor takes and survives ― as that of the Oscar-winning F. Murray Abraham in &quot;Amadeus.&quot;&quot;

In the 1980s, Hall co-starred in various films in supporting roles, including &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986), &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988), &quot;Say Anything...&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (both 1989). He played &quot;Lt. Joe Bookman&quot;, a detective pursuing a long-overdue library book in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episodes, &quot;The Library&quot; and &quot;The Finale&quot;. His first &quot;Seinfeld&quot; appearance led him to be widely lauded as one of the best guest stars on the series, and led to many other jobs.

Hall contributed an opening narration, a parody of the announcements one would hear on Magnetic Reference Laboratory&#x27;s calibration tapes for analogue tape recorders, on &quot;1000 Hurts,&quot; the 2000 album by Chicago post-punk band Shellac.

Hall starred in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s short film &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Coffee&quot;, which was adapted into Anderson&#x27;s directorial debut film &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996). For the film, Hall played a senior gambler who mentors a homeless man (John C. Reilly). Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said about Hall, &quot;Here is another great performance. He is a man who has been around, who knows casinos and gambling, who finds himself attached to three people he could easily have avoided, who thinks before he acts.&quot; Hall was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. He later starred in Anderson&#x27;s other films &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997) and &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999). He was nominated for two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Hall starred with Philip Seymour Hoffman in four films.

Hall had turns in a variety of films in the 1990s, including &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, and &quot;The Insider&quot;. He co-starred in other films in the 2000s, including &quot;Dogville&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, and &quot;Argo&quot;. He played Captain Diel in the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; trilogy (though his scenes were cut from &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and he was uncredited for the scene in &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;). Hall had prominent roles in &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, &quot;In Good Company&quot;, &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, &quot;The Matador&quot;, &quot;You Kill Me&quot;, &quot;All Good Things&quot;, &quot;50/50&quot;, and &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;.

Hall starred in the sitcom &quot;The Loop&quot;. He guest starred in the animated series &quot;The Life &amp; Times of Tim&quot;. He played a physician in &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Modern Family&quot;. He appeared in an episode of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; and in a Holiday Inn commercial. For the short film &quot;Dear Chickens&quot;, he won best actor at Los Angeles Short Festival and at Filmets Badalona Film Festival in Barcelona.

Hall also undertook stage work in New York and Los Angeles, but did not appear on Broadway.

==Personal life and death==
Hall had two daughters, Patricia and Darcy, with his first wife, Mary-Ella Holst. He later married Holly Wolfle, with whom he had two daughters, Adella and Anna. He also had four grandchildren and a brother.

Hall died of emphysema at his home in Glendale, California, on June 12, 2022, at the age of 90.

<doc id="1329631" wikidata="Q1319618" url="?curid=1329631" title="Kang bed-stove">
<text>The kang (; Manchu: &quot;nahan&quot;, ) is a traditional heated platform, 2 metres or more long, used for general living, working, entertaining and sleeping in the northern part of China, where the winter climate is cold. It is made of bricks or other forms of fired clay and more recently of concrete in some locations. The word &quot;kang&quot; means &quot;to dry&quot;.

Its interior cavity, leading to an often-convoluted flue system, channels the hot exhaust from a firewood/coal fireplace, usually the cooking fire from an adjacent room that serves as a kitchen, sometimes from a stove set below floor level. This allows a longer contact time between the exhaust (which still contains much heat from the combustion source) and (indirectly) the inside of the room, hence more heat transfer/recycling back into the room, effectively making it a ducted heating system similar to the Roman hypocaust. A separate stove may be used to control the amount of smoke circulating through the &quot;kang&quot;, maintaining comfort in warmer weather. Typically, a &quot;kang&quot; occupies one-third to one half of the floor space, and is used for sleeping at night and for other activities during the day. A &quot;kang&quot; which covers the entire floor is called a dikang ().

Like the European masonry stove, a massive block of masonry is used to retain heat. While it might take several hours of heating to reach the desired surface temperature, a properly designed bed raised to sufficient temperature should remain warm throughout the night without the need to maintain a fire.

== History ==
Sites in Shenyang, Liaoning, show humans using the heated bed floor as early as 7,200 years ago. The bed at this excavation is made of 10 cm pounded clay on the floor. The bed was heated by &quot;zhidi&quot; , placing an open fire on the bed floor and clearing the ashes before sleeping. In the excavated example the repeated burning is believed to have turned the bed surface hard and moisture resistant.

The first known heated platform appeared in what is now Northeastern China and used a single-flue system like the Roman hypocaust and the Korean &quot;ondol&quot;. An example was unearthed among 1st-century building remains in Heilongjiang Province. Its flue is L-shaped, built from adobe and cobblestones and covered with stone slabs.

Heated walls &quot;huoqiang&quot; () with a double-flue system were found in a 4th-century palace building in Jilin Province. It had an L-shaped adobe bench with a double-flue system. The structure is more complex than a single-flue system and has functionality similar to a &quot;kang&quot;.

Literary evidence from Li Daoyuan&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Water Classic&quot; also gives evidence of heated floors during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386–534 AD), though this was not explicitly named a &quot;dikang&quot;:

The &quot;kang&quot; may have evolved to its bed design due to ongoing cultural changes during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, as high furniture and chairs came to be prevalent over the earlier style of floor-sitting and low-lying furniture in Chinese culture. The earliest &quot;kang&quot; remains have been discovered at Ninghai, Heilongjiang Province, in the Longquanfu Palace (699–926) of Balhae origin.
==Culture==

&quot;Traditional Chinese Dwellings&quot; &quot;Zhongguo chuantong minju&quot; () (a bilingual text) has a few line drawings of &quot;kangs&quot;. It says that the &quot;kang&quot; is used to cook meals and heat the room, making full use of the heat-retaining capacity of the loess (soil used to make adobe). The &quot;kang&quot; produces radiant heat to indirectly warm the interior space as well as the bed mass itself. It has been speculated that one of the oldest forms of Chinese housing, heated cave dwellings known as yaodong (), widespread throughout northern China would have been uninhabitable without the &quot;kang&quot;.

The &quot;kang&quot; was also an important feature of traditional dwellings in often-frigid Manchuria, where it was known as &quot;nahan&quot; in Manchu. It plays an important role in Manchurian mourning customs. The deceased is placed beside the &quot;kang&quot; instead of in the central hall, as is Han Chinese practice. The height of the board on which the body is placed indicates the family status or age of the deceased.

== History ==

In the local Sadri language &quot;Rourkela&quot; means &quot;Your village&quot; (&quot;Rour&quot; = Your &amp; &quot;Kela&quot; comes from the word &quot;Kila&quot; which means village). It comes under Sundergarh district of the Indian state of Odisha.

The twin towns of Rourkela and Fertilizer Township, as well as their developed periphery, are located in areas that were once covered by dense forests. According to the census report of 2011, Rourkela has a population of (Rourkela Industrial Township is and Rourkela Town is ) and the urban metropolitan area population is 536,450. Then railway station of Rourkela was within the revenue village of Mahulpali.

India&#x27;s first public sector steel plant facility was established in Rourkela with the help of German businesses Krupp and Demag. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the town was the largest German colony outside Germany.

Following India&#x27;s independence, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, wanted to make India an industrialized state in Soviet model of social development; giving wings to his dreams, Sri Biju Pattanaik convinced Pandit Nehru to consider the location of Rourkela for setting up a steel plant. The mineral-rich zone of Rourkela intersected by the rivers Brahmani, Koel and Sankha from two sides was aptly chosen for the same.

The preliminary survey for the steel plant at Rourkela was started in 1952 and the Government of Odisha issued a gazette notification on 16 February 1954. In accordance with the notification, the Government of Odisha acquired an area of about 80 square miles around Rourkela for the purpose of Steel Plant. The German private companies Krupp and Demag came forward to provide financial and technical help for the proposed steel plant at Rourkela. Krupp built Rourkela Steel Plant drawing from experience from its own works in Essen, Germany. The technical experts of the company advised the Government of India as well as the Government of Odisha for acquiring more land. As a result, a further area of 32 square kilometres was acquired out of 31 revenue villages. Almost 13,000 people in 2,424 families lost their dwelling. Later further of land were acquired out of 31 revenue villages for the construction of Mandira Dam, a water embankment. Moreland was requisitioned for the purpose of constructing railway lines to Hatia and Barsuan. The construction of the Bondamunda Railway junction required the further acquisition of land which resulted in 20,000 people&#x27;s displacement from their habitat. Though there was initial discontentment among the tribals about the land acquisition the authority largely resolved the land dispute, as many of the tribals were provided employment and accommodation. The displaced tribals were relocated to places such as Jalda, Jhirpani, Bisra, and Bondamunda. Their new settlement even extended beyond the river Koel.

Thousands of technical personnel from West Germany came to Rourkela to extend their technical assistance. Some of these Germans came with their family and their small diaspora created the &#x27;Indo-German Club&#x27; to socialise. The club exists today with a well-stocked library known as Max Muller library. There are a plethora of local stories of Germans social encounters with tribals (local Adivasis) and people from other parts of India who had relocated themselves to Rourkela for employment. A large part of this population was from coastal and western Odisha who were trained by the German workforce to adapt to the steel plant&#x27;s technology rigour. The steel plant, which was hugely surrounded by forest, many times witnessed wild animals straying into the plant area. A royal Bengal tiger&#x27;s lugubrious death in the steel plant&#x27;s massive blast furnace is a part of the city&#x27;s folklore. There were also tales about the disappearance of Germans in the nearby Vedvyas cave and the dread whirlpool of river Koel. The river still accounts for human casualty as some day-trippers&#x27; wade into the water unaware of the maelstrom.

Included with the tunnel are western approaches to the DL&amp;W mainline and Boonton Branch; the former includes a new bridge over the Hackensack River, south of the old one (which is then used only for the Erie&#x27;s Newark and Greenwood Lake Branches). The new alignment at first crosses the New Jersey Midland Railroad (NYS&amp;W) at grade.

==1883==
* The National Docks Railway is constructed to connect the National Storage Company docks at Black Tom with the Pennsylvania Railroad in Jersey City. The PRR controls and operates the railroad until 1889, when control passes to the New York Central Railroad after completion of the New Jersey Junction Railroad.

==1890==
* The Lehigh Valley Railroad constructs the Edgewater Railway, on the north side of the Morris Canal basin.

==1891==
* The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), rebuilds the passenger ferry terminal to replace the old terminal which was partially destroyed by fire. The new terminal is raised above the old level to accommodate new elevated rails that eliminate grade crossings in the city.

==1892==
* The Lehigh Valley Railroad opens its bridge across Newark Bay. The LVRR connects with the National Docks Railway east of the bridge in order to reach the LVRR terminal.

==1894==
* May 15: The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway Edgewater Tunnel through the Palisades opened to freight traffic. The mile-long tunnel took 18 months to construct and provides the NYS&amp;W access to its own waterside terminal in Edgewater. The NYS&amp;W had previously used the DL&amp;W terminal in Hoboken.

==1897==
*The Hoboken Manufacturers Railroad opens.
*The National Docks and New Jersey Junction Connecting Railway (LV + NYC) is completed. This line was mainly a short tunnel under the Pennsylvania Railroad to connect the New Jersey Junction Railroad (NYC) with the National Docks Railway (LV + NYC).

==1960==
*The Erie Railroad trains shift to Hoboken Terminal, as the company merges with the Lackawanna Railroad.
Erie trains began moving to Hoboken in Oct 1956 for off peak and weekend trains. Peak hour trains began using Hoboken on March 25, 1957 with the exception of Nyack and NYS&amp;W trains which continued to use the few remaining tracks in Jersey City. NYS&amp;W trains were later discontinued and Nyack trains used a backup move to reach Hoboken until they were discontinued in 1966.

==1967==
* With the Aldene Plan, Communipaw Terminal, the last Jersey City terminal closes. Lehigh Valley trains now terminate at Newark Penn Station, as do Reading Railroad trains. CNJ Trains run over LV from Roselle Park, NJ to Newark, NJ then on the PRR and terminate at Newark Penn Station, and use a small yard in Harrison. It was not until the late 1990s, when the midtown direct service was instituted, that NJ TRANSIT ran a service of some Raritan Valley trains to Hoboken (Penn Sta. New York).

==1983==
NY Waterway re-institutes ferry service across the Hudson.

==1994==
A short, partially elevated track, known as the Marion Running Track, is built to connect the ex-PRR Passaic and Harsimus Line from Kearny to the ex-Erie Northern Branch. This reconfiguration provided the ex-NYC West Shore (aka River Line) with a more direct connection to other lines heading west and south at Marion Junction.

==1999/2000==
Conrail Shared Assets Operations created. CSX River line is shifted to the re-newed Northern Running track to North Bergen Yard.

==2000==

<text>Rod Lurie (; born May 15, 1962) is an American director, screenwriter, and former film critic.

==Early life and career==
The son of internationally syndicated cartoonist Ranan Lurie, he was born in Israel but moved to the United States at a young age, growing up in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Honolulu, Hawaii.

Graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1984, he served in the U.S. Army as an air defense artillery officer, then became an entertainment reporter and film critic, including stints at News12 in Norwalk, Connecticut, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, &quot;Movieline&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, and talk radio shows at KMPC and KABC, where his tactical on-air bets with Martin Landau, Mel Gibson and James Cameron that they would win the Oscar resulted in them having to pay up at the Academy Awards ceremony by publicly thanking him in their acceptance speeches.

As an investigative reporter in the entertainment industry, his discovery of unethical and illegal practices at tabloid newspapers gained him national exposure on programs such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, and &quot;Geraldo&quot;. His irreverent style, however (he once described Danny DeVito as a &quot;testicle with arms&quot;), often raised controversy and got him banned from screenings.

In 1995, his book &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: Moviemaking, Con Games, and Murder in Glitter City&quot;, was published.

==Film and TV career==
Lurie&#x27;s first foray into filmmaking, as writer and director, was the low-budget political thriller &quot;Deterrence&quot; (1999), with Kevin Pollak as the first Jewish President of the United States.

His second was &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000), starring Gary Oldman. It was written for Joan Allen and co-stars Jeff Bridges and Christian Slater. It was a critical success (76 percent positive on Rotten Tomatoes) and garnered Academy Award nominations for both Allen and Bridges.

His next directing effort, &quot;The Last Castle&quot; (2001) with Robert Redford and James Gandolfini, was a commercial failure; as was &quot;Line of Fire&quot;, his 2003–04 TV series about the FBI&#x27;s office in Richmond, Virginia, which starred David Paymer as a mob boss.

Lurie then wrote and directed &quot;Nothing But the Truth&quot;, which is based on the stories of Valerie Plame and Judith Miller, which stars Kate Beckinsale, Matt Dillon, Angela Bassett, Alan Alda and David Schwimmer. Lurie insisted his film is not intended to be an accurate depiction of the Plame Affair, but merely a vehicle to explore a similar situation, which he then takes several steps further. &quot;You look at the story that happened in reality, and Judy Miller gets some sort of permission to speak and then speaks. So what? Nothing really big came of the whole thing,&quot; explained Lurie in an interview published prior to the film&#x27;s release. &quot;I tried to make a movie that&#x27;s a commercial thriller as well as being something that&#x27;s topical.&quot;

Lurie worked on &quot;Resurrecting the Champ&quot;, a boxing drama, and served as creator and executive producer of the short-lived television series &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, which starred Geena Davis as the United States&#x27; first female President, Mackenzie Allen. The show&#x27;s high ratings plummeted after Lurie&#x27;s departure from the show and its cancellation followed.

Lurie worked for ABC, but his contract, which was terminated during the writers&#x27; strike, was not renewed when it ended.

Lurie places tributes to his &quot;alma mater&quot; in his shows: &quot;Deterrence&quot; had an aide-de-camp to the President admitting he had to settle for the United States Air Force Academy because he couldn&#x27;t get into West Point. Also, in &quot;The Contender&quot;, Bridges&#x27; president Evans can be seen wearing a West Point sweatshirt during the film.

The characters of President Jackson Evans (&quot;The Contender&quot;), prison inmate Lt. Gen. Eugene Irwin (&quot;The Last Castle&quot;), FBI agent Paige Van Doren (&quot;Line of Fire&quot;), and vice presidential nominee Gen. (ret.) Warren Keaton (&quot;Commander in Chief&quot;) are all fictional graduates of the &quot;Long Gray Line&quot;.

Lurie also directed the remake of the home invasion thriller &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. It received negative reviews from both audience viewers and critics, and did very poorly at the box office.

Lurie directed the 2020 war film &quot;The Outpost&quot;, based on the true story of the Battle of Kamdesh during the War in Afghanistan. The film received highly positive reviews, with significant praise for the battle sequences and depictions of the soldiers.

In September 2021, Lurie said he was working on a boxing epic set at West Point.

Lurie&#x27;s most recent film &quot;The Senior&quot; was released in 2023.

==Personal life==
Lurie lives in Los Angeles with his wife, author Kyra Davis. He has three children, Hunter, Paige, and Isaac. Hunter died on July 2, 2018, aged 27 from a cardiac arrest. Lurie adopted his stepson Isaac in 2023.

<doc id="1329694" wikidata="Q3481819" url="?curid=1329694" title="List of English words of Old Norse origin">
<text>Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language, primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England between the mid 9th to the 11th centuries (see also Danelaw). 
Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as &quot;egg&quot; or &quot;knife&quot;. 
There are hundreds of such words, and the list below does not aim at completeness.

To be distinguished from loan words which date back to the Old English period are modern Old Norse loans originating in the context of Old Norse philology, such as &quot;kenning&quot; (1871), and loans from modern Icelandic (such as &quot;geyser&quot;, 1781).
Yet another class comprises loans from Old Norse into Old French, which via Anglo-Norman were then indirectly loaned into Middle English; an example is &quot;flâneur&quot;, via French from the Old Norse verb &quot;to wander aimlessly&quot;.

<text>The EMC AB6 was a type of diesel locomotive built exclusively for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;) by General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Corporation and delivered in June 1940. Two examples were built, numbered #750 and #751. They were built for the &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot; passenger train, which travelled as a unified train from Chicago, Illinois, to Limon, Colorado, which then divided. One section went to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the other to Denver, Colorado. The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route, and could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs. A regular, cab-equipped A-unit could have been purchased, but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train, so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an E-series E6B (B unit) but with an operating cab, headlight, pilot, and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive.

Since the small three- and four-car trains the units would have to haul independently were very light, the AB6 pair were built with only one 1,000 hp EMC 567 V12 engine, and a baggage compartment where the second engine would have been. Later, with increasing trainloads, the baggage compartment was replaced with a second engine.

In 1965, the units had their steam generators replaced with head-end power and were reassigned to push-pull suburban service in the Chicago area. In this form, they lasted until the mid-1970s and were eventually scrapped.

<text>Sucrases are digestive enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of sucrose to its component monosaccharides, fructose and glucose. One form, sucrase-isomaltase, is secreted in the small intestine on the brush border. The enzyme invertase, which occurs more commonly in plants, fungi and bacteria, also hydrolyzes sucrose (and other fructosides) but by a different mechanism: it is a fructosidase, whereas sucrase is a glucosidase.

==Types==
* is sucrase-isomaltase
* is sucrose alpha-glucosidase

==Physiology==
Sucrose intolerance (also known as congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (GSID), or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency) occurs when sucrase is not being secreted in the small intestine. With sucrose intolerance, the result of consuming sucrose is excess gas production and often diarrhea and malabsorption. Lactose intolerance is a similar condition that reflects an individual&#x27;s inability to hydrolyze the disaccharide lactose.

Sucrase is secreted by the tips of the villi of the epithelium in the small intestine. Its levels are reduced in response to villi-blunting events such as celiac sprue and the inflammation associated with the disorder. The levels increase in pregnancy, lactation, and diabetes as the villi hypertrophy.

==Use in chemical analysis==
Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar, so will not test positive with Benedict&#x27;s solution. To test for sucrose, the sample is treated with sucrase. The sucrose is hydrolysed into glucose and fructose, with glucose being a reducing sugar, which in turn tests positive with Benedict&#x27;s solution..

==In other species==
Cedar waxwings (&quot;Bombycilla cedrorum&quot;) and American robins (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;) have evolved to lose this enzyme due to their insectivorous and frugivorous diets. This absence produces digestive difficulty if challenged with unusual amounts of the sugar.

<text>Oscar Kelly Allen Sr. (August 8, 1882 – January 28, 1936), also known as O. K. Allen, was the 42nd Governor of Louisiana from 1932 to 1936.

== Nuggets ==
He was elected to the Louisiana state Senate in 1928 in the wake of Huey Long&#x27;s landslide victory in the gubernatorial election. He defeated the anti-Long incumbent, former Republican Henry E. Hardtner of La Salle Parish. Allen served as Long&#x27;s floor leader in the Senate; he was also appointed by the governor as chairman of the Louisiana Highway Commission, serving from 1928 until 1930. His appointment was legally challenged. In the litigation that reached the Louisiana Supreme Court, it ruled that holding both legislative and executive positions simultaneously was unconstitutional. Allen resigned as chairman.

Allen was elected governor in the shadow of Huey Long, who had resigned after being elected as US Senator from Louisiana and relocated to Washington, D.C.. Allen was considered a political stooge for former governor Long. His brother Earl Long once joked that a leaf blew into Allen&#x27;s office one day and that he signed it, thinking it was legislation from Long.

==Death and honors==
Allen died in the governor&#x27;s mansion of a brain hemorrhage. One week before his death, he won the Democratic nomination in the special election to fill the vacancy in the U.S. Senate caused by Huey Long&#x27;s assassination.

Allen was the namesake of the O.K. Allen Bridge across the Red River between Alexandria and Pineville. The bridge was imploded on September 26, 2015, due to construction on a new bridge to be named the Curtis-Coleman Memorial Bridge.

The former governor is honored, along with his predecessor, by the Huey P. Long–O. K. Allen Bridge, which carries U.S. 190 (Airline Highway) across the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, as well as the Long-Allen Bridge over the Red River between Shreveport and Bossier City, among others.

<text>Amigos de las Américas (literally &quot;Friends of the Americas&quot;), or AMIGOS, is a nonprofit organization based in Houston with 25 chapters across the US. The Vision of AMIGOS is &quot;A world where each young person becomes a life-long catalyst for social change.&quot; AMIGOS works towards this vision by inspiring and building young leaders through collaborative community development and immersion in cross-cultural experiences.

== History ==
AMIGOS was founded in 1965 when 29-year-old Guy Bevil Jr., youth pastor at River Oaks Baptist Church in Houston led a team of 181 teenagers and young adults to Honduras to administer polio vaccinations. The group took donations of supplies, recruited 36 doctors, and practiced administering vaccines in Houston. Many participants made the 1,500-mile trip by truck in order to ship the supplies into rural Honduras. The first summer in Honduras, volunteers inoculated over half a million people.

Upon their arrival home, Bevil and his group founded Amigos de Honduras, which grew to be Amigos de las Américas within the next year. Over half of the original participants applied to return the next summer. For the following two decades, AMIGOS focused primarily on administering vaccinations.

AMIGOS has expanded to many different countries including Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, The Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Peru, though some countries do not currently have active projects.

Other founders recognized by AMIGOS are H. Kirby Atwood, Sr., Searcy Bracewell, Raymond Cook, Ed Frank, Jr., Carlos R. Hamilton, MD, Victor Huvelle, Mariann and John Marshall, Ed Morris, and Wilson J. Pais.

== Today ==
Amigos de las Américas is a non-religious, non-governmental, non-profit organization based out of Houston. AMIGOS offers summer and gap year programs for people aged 13–25. After extensive training in the US, participants travel to Latin America where they live for anywhere between two weeks to nine months with a host family in a small community.

Participants are partnered with one or two other participants to carrying out health, education, and environmental programs, ranging from latrine construction to formation of youth groups to teaching environmental sustainability and dental hygiene. The programs are carried out in partnership with partner agencies, which have included Save the Children, Plan International, and the governments of the various countries above. Asset-based community development is at the core of AMIGOS projects.

Each year, roughly 600 young people take part in AMIGOS various Latin American programs. Over 28,000 people have participated in the program since it began.

== Program organization ==
The National Office of AMIGOS is still located in Houston and employs a small staff year-round to manage the programs. Sara Nathan is President and CEO.

AMIGOS encourages returning project participants to take leadership roles within the organization. Each project (generally organized geographically and thematically) is led by a Project Director, who is aided by an Associate Project Director. Senior Project Supervisors and Project Supervisors oversee individual community projects and act as liaisons between Project Leadership Teams and participants in community. Alumni can also stay active by joining a local chapter board.

== The Community Impact Project ==
The summer of 2020 was affected significantly by COVID-19. In response, Amigos de las Américas created a six-week online experience for young people to obtain the benefits of a traditional experience while also benefiting their community. In groups of 8-12 students from both the U.S. and Latin America, participants connect with other students and still are able to participate in a cross-cultural exchange.

<text>New Train is an album by Paul Pena, recorded in 1973 and released in 2000. The album was recorded at Bearsville Records and produced by Ben Sidran (keyboardist for the Steve Miller Band).

==The album==
&quot;New Train&quot; features Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia playing pedal steel guitar and Merl Saunders (frequent collaborator with Garcia and the Dead) on keyboards on &quot;Venutian Lady&quot; and &quot;New Train&quot;, and the a cappella group The Persuasions singing on &quot;Gonna Move&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Move and Groove.&quot;

Stylistically, the album runs the gamut from straight-up rock and roll (on the original version of &quot;Jet Airliner&quot;) to folk to acid rock (on the Jimi Hendrix-esque &quot;Cosmic Mirror&quot;) to Rhythm and Blues on the standout track &quot;Gonna Move&quot;. The Grateful Dead-inspired &quot;Venutian Lady&quot; echoes their hit &quot;Bertha&quot;.

Albert Grossman, owner of Bearsville Records, stopped release of the record after a dispute, possibly over the marketability of the record, or, according to Sidran, Pena&#x27;s refusal to relocate to the East Coast to work more closely with Grossman.

Ben Sidran gave an unreleased copy of &quot;New Train&quot; to Steve Miller, who recorded Pena&#x27;s &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; with his band for their 1977 album &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;. The &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; single went to #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Pena&#x27;s primary source of income in his later years were royalties from that single.

The album remained unreleased for 27 years. After years of unsuccessful attempts, Pena&#x27;s attorney (and original executive producer on the album) Jon Waxman negotiated for the album&#x27;s release in 2000 on the New York-based Hybrid Recordings label.

<text>Kiryat Tiv&#x27;on (, also Qiryat Tiv&#x27;on) is a town in the Haifa District of Israel, in the hills between the Zvulun (Zebulon) and Jezreel valleys. Kiryat Tiv&#x27;on is located southeast of Haifa, on the main road to Nazareth. Kiryat Tiv&#x27;on is the result of the municipal merger of several older settlements, Tiv&#x27;on (est. 1946), Elro&#x27;i (est. 1935), Kiryat Haroshet (est. 1935) and Kiryat Amal (est. 1937). On the outskirts of Tiv&#x27;on is a Bedouin township called Basmat Tab&#x27;un. In 2022 it had a population of 19,130.

In the area of Kiryat Tivon, one can find the National Park and the World Heritage Site Beit She&#x27;arim, the Sanhedrin&#x27;s Seat and the burial place of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, as well as the sculpture of Alexander Zaid, who resided in the area with his family and was murdered nearby.

==History==


===Ancient Israel===
An ancient Jewish town called Tiv&#x27;on existed in the general area. It was mentioned in the Talmud and Mishnah. It is mentioned several times in Talmudic literature in connection with various sages, some of whom lived there.

===Ottoman Empire===
In 1859, the village of &quot;Tubaun&quot; was estimated to have a tillage of 22 feddans. In 1875, Victor Guérin found that the village had 200 inhabitants. In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described &quot;Tubaun&quot; as a small adobe village, on high ground, at the edge of the wood. A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Tuba&#x27;un&quot; had about 90 inhabitants; all Muslims.

===British Mandate===
The 1922 census of Palestine showed that &quot;Tub&#x27;un&quot; had 151 inhabitants, all Muslim.

The area was acquired by the Jewish community as part of the Sursock Purchase. In 1925 a Zionist organisation purchased 30 feddans in Kiskis (present Alonim) and Tabaun (present Kiryat Tiv&#x27;on) from the Sursuk family of Beirut. At the time, there were 36 families living there. In the 1931 census &quot;Tabun&quot; had a population of 239, still all Muslim, in a total of 48 houses. From 1931-1935, a significant land controversy arose from competing claims by the Jewish Agency and Palestinian tenant farmers over the area, culminating in a violent clash between local Bedouins and Jewish watchmen in 1935.

In the 1945 statistics, &quot;al Tivon&quot; (Alonim) (previously &quot;Qusqus Taboun&quot;) had 370 Muslim and 320 Jewish inhabitants, with a total land area of 5,823 dunams. Of this, 141 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 2,038 for cereals, while 3,644 dunams were classified as non-cultivable land.


===Modern Israel===
The symbol of Kiryat Tiv&#x27;on is the cyclamen, a flower that grows between the rocks, reflecting the town&#x27;s appreciation of nature and its efforts to preserve the landscape and safeguard the environment.

== Population ==
According to data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (as of the end of September 2020, an estimate), there are 18,312 residents living in Kiryat Tivon. The population has been growing at an annual rate of 3%. The percentage of those eligible for a matriculation certificate among 12th-grade students in the academic year 2020-2021 was 84.1%. The average monthly salary of an employee in 2019 was 12,598 NIS (national average: 9,745 NIS).

== Characteristics of Kiryat Tivon ==
=== Climate ===
The climate conditions in the area are considered comfortable. The annual average temperature difference is 19 Celsius degrees. The average temperature between day and night is 10 degrees Celsius. The average humidity is 65% - 70%. The number of sunny days per year ranges from 20 to 40 days, and heavy overcast days range from 3 to 6 days. The average annual rainfall is 700 millimeters.

=== Flora ===
In the hilly area within the boundaries of the settlement and its vicinity, grow remnants of the Quercus ithaburensis forest, Styrax officinalis, Pistacia atlantica, a Mediterranean forest, as well as a new intensive forest of Pine trees planted by the Jewish National Fund (AKA Keren Kayemet LeYisrael). Among the Tabor oak trees stands the ancient oak tree with a trunk circumference of 5.3 meters. Benches have been placed around it as a corner of remembrance for the soldier Ilan Gabbai, a paratrooper officer who died in the Second Lebanon War.

One-third of the settlement&#x27;s area is covered with trees.

==Education==
* Oranim Academic College- For educational studies.
* Ramat Hadassah youth village - founded by the Jewish Agency for Israel.
* Kfar Tikvah, village for disabled people.

==Landmarks==

<text>The federal minister for foreign affairs () is the head of the Federal Foreign Office and a member of the Cabinet of Germany. The current office holder is Annalena Baerbock. Since 1966, the minister for foreign affairs has often also simultaneously held the office of vice-chancellor of Germany.

==History of the office==
The Foreign Office was established within the North German Confederation in 1870 and its head, first appointed in 1871, had the rank of secretary of state. As the German constitution of 1871 installed the chancellor as the sole responsible government minister and since the Chancellor generally also held the position of foreign minister of Prussia, the secretary of state fulfilled a more subject role as an assistant to the chancellor, acting largely to draft correspondence rather than to actually direct the formation of foreign policy. This was especially true during the chancellorships of Otto von Bismarck (1871–1890) and Bernhard von Bülow (1900–1909), both of whom had considerable prior experience with foreign affairs, while secretaries at other times wielded more influence over the foreign policy.
In 1919, the Weimar Republic elevated the head of the foreign office to the position of foreign minister responsible for his department. As governments were now formed by parties entering coalitions with each other, individual ministers also gained independence towards from the chancellor.

After a succession of short-lived ministers, Gustav Stresemann, leader of the small National-liberal German People&#x27;s Party, held the office of foreign minister in successive cabinets from 1923 to his death in 1929. His long term gave stability to Germany&#x27;s foreign policy and improved the minister&#x27;s position towards the relatively weak and short-lived chancellors. Stresemann was awarded the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize for his work for reconciliation between Germany and France.

The foreign office remained relatively unaffected by the establishment of the Nazi regime in 1933, as minister Konstantin von Neurath, appointed in 1932, remained in office until 1938; however, the office was increasingly marginalised in actual policy-making and with the replacement of Neurath by Ribbentrop lost any independent standing.

After World War II, two separate German states emerged in 1949, the democratic Federal Republic of Germany in the West and the communist-ruled German Democratic Republic in the East. While the Soviet Union ostensibly restored political sovereignty to its satellite and allowed for a Foreign Ministry of the GDR, West Germany&#x27;s sovereignty was officially curtailed by the Western powers, especially in the field of foreign policy. In 1951 the Foreign Office was reestablished in West Germany, but Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was required to hold the office of Foreign Minister until the Western powers restored sovereignty to West Germany in 1955. Then, Heinrich von Brentano di Tremezzo succeeded as foreign minister in 1955. In 1990, the GDR ceased to exist as a separate state and its territory was reunited with West Germany.

From the 1966 Grand Coalition government of Kurt Georg Kiesinger onwards, the office has been held by a member of the smaller partner in coalitions. Therefore, the foreign minister also mostly holds the office of vice chancellor of Germany, although this has become less common in recent years – neither of the two most recent foreign ministers, Heiko Maas and Annalena Baerbock, have been vice chancellor, with the vice chancellorship being held by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz during Maas&#x27; tenure, and by Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck during Baerbock&#x27;s.

<text>Talkie Walkie is the third studio album by French electronic music duo Air, released on 26 January 2004 by Virgin Records. &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the 2003 film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, and &quot;Run&quot; was used in both the &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; episode &quot;Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner&quot; and the 2004 French film &quot;Lila Says&quot;. &quot;Talkie-walkie&quot; means walkie-talkie in French.

As of November 2006, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; had sold 161,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album shipped 405,000 copies outside France within two weeks of its release, according to Virgin Records.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 29 reviews. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;excellent&quot; and commented that Air &quot;return to what they do best: elegantly moody soundtrack music for imaginary films.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Piers Martin commented, &quot;It is light and fluffy, of course, but tender and romantic, synthetic and soulful, too. It sounds, effortlessly, new and different, fresh and focused, clean and Zen, no doubt the outcome of Godin and Dunckel&#x27;s decision to play and programme all the instruments and perform all the vocals on the record themselves in Paris without any external assistance...&quot;. Praise was given to the subtle touch producer Nigel Godrich and string arranger Michel Colombier presumably brought to the album at its final stage, and the more personal and tighter songwriting.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; the 20th best album of 2004, and later placed it at number 191 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

<text>François Maynard, sometimes seen as &quot;de Maynard&quot; (21 November 1582 – 28 December 1646) was a French poet who spent much of his life in Toulouse.

==Biography==
Maynard was born in Toulouse to a father who was &quot;conseiller&quot; in the &quot;parlement&quot; of the town. François was also trained for the law, becoming eventually president of Aurillac. He became secretary to Margaret of Valois, wife of Henry IV of France, for whom his early poems are written. He was a disciple of Malherbe, who said that in the workmanship of his lines he excelled Racan, but lacked his rival&#x27;s energy.

In 1634 he accompanied the Cardinal de Noailles to Rome and spent about two years in Italy. On his return to France he made many unsuccessful efforts to obtain the favor of Cardinal Richelieu, but was obliged to retire to Toulouse. He never ceased to lament his exile from Paris and his inability to be present at the meetings of the Académie française, of which he was one of the earliest members. The best of his poems is in imitation of Horace, &quot;Alcippe, reviens dans nos bois&quot;. He died at Toulouse in 1646.

His works consist of odes, epigrams, songs and letters, and were published in 1646 by Mann le Roy de Gomberville.

One of his famous poems is called &quot;Le Nouveau Riche&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
Pierre who during his youth,
Was a famous cobbler;
Is superb of his richness
And ashamed of his old trade.
This fortunate merchant of boots
Owns a park, close to my home,
Of which the fountains and the grottos
Are worthy of the houses of the king.
I am confused when I think
That he dug a canal there
By which the magnificent expense
would astonish the cardinal.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1329798" wikidata="Q2975237" url="?curid=1329798" title="Chiba clan">
<text>The Chiba clan (千葉氏 &quot;Chiba-shi&quot;) was a Japanese &quot;gōzoku&quot; and samurai family descending from the Taira clan. The clan was founded by Chiba Tsunetane, the son of Taira no Tadatsune. The Chiba governed in Shimōsa Province, and the clan was based in present-day Chiba City. Additionally, for a period, the clan controlled the Sōma Manor that extended into present-day Ibaraki. After the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, the head of the Chiba clan became the hereditary shugo governor of Shimōsa Province.

== Origin ==

The Chiba clan descends from the 8th century Emperor Kanmu through the sequence of Imperial Prince Kazurahara (786–853) — Prince Takami — Taira no Takamochi — Muraoka Yoshifumi — Muraoka Tadayori — Chiba Tadatsune — Chiba Tsunemasa — Chiba Tsunenaga — Chiba Tsunekane — Chiba Tsuneshige — Chiba Tsunetane — Azuma Taneyori . The Emperor Go-Daigo authorized the head of Chiba family, Chiba Sadatane, as chief &quot;daimyō&quot; and samurai of the Kantō region. The clan settled in the Shimōsa area in the early 12th century. The Chiba came into conflict with Minamoto no Yoshitomo during the 1140s over estates in present-day Chiba Prefecture. The Chiba, however, came to support Yoshitomo in the Hōgen Rebellion (1156).

== Genpei War ==
During the Genpei War (1180–1185) the Chiba clan, as well as the Hōjō, Miura, and Doi clans, opposed the greater &#x27;core&#x27; Taira clan and supported Minamoto no Yoritomo. Chiba Tsunetane, clan chief of the period, won Yoritomo’s trust and helped establish the Kamakura shogunate. The power of the clan increased in this period, but ultimately declined during the Muromachi period (1336–1573).

== Later history ==
The Chiba clan was completely conquered by Toyotomi Hideyoshi before the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. Many descendants of the Chiba clan live in Chiba Prefecture today. Chiba Castle, reconstructed in 1967, is built on the site of Inohana Castle, an area previously controlled by the clan.

<doc id="1329800" wikidata="Q747866" url="?curid=1329800" title="Hibernate (framework)">
<text>Hibernate ORM (or simply Hibernate) is an object–relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate handles object–relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.

Hibernate is free software that is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1.

Hibernate&#x27;s primary feature is mapping from Java classes to database tables, and mapping from Java data types to SQL data types. Hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It generates SQL calls and relieves the developer from the manual handling and object conversion of the result set.

==Mapping==
The mapping of Java classes to database tables is implemented by the configuration of an XML file or by using Java Annotations. When using an XML file, Hibernate can generate skeleton source code for the persistence classes. This is auxiliary when annotations are used. Hibernate can use the XML file or the Java annotations to maintain the database schema.

There are provided facilities to arrange one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between classes. In addition to managing associations between objects, Hibernate can also manage reflexive associations wherein an object has a one-to-many relationship with other instances of the class type.

Hibernate supports the mapping of custom value types. This makes the following scenarios possible:
* Overriding the default SQL type when mapping a column to a property.
* Mapping Java Enums to columns as though they were regular properties.
* Mapping a single property to multiple columns.

Definition:
Objects in an object-oriented application follow OOP principles, while objects in the back-end follow database normalization principles, resulting in different representation requirements. This problem is called &quot;object–relational impedance mismatch&quot;. Mapping is a way of resolving the object–relational impedance mismatch problem.

Mapping informs the ORM tool of what Java class object to store in which database table.

==Hibernate Query Language (HQL)==
Hibernate provides a SQL inspired language called Hibernate Query Language (HQL) for writing SQL-like queries against Hibernate&#x27;s data objects. &quot;Criteria Queries&quot; are provided as an object-oriented alternative to HQL. Criteria Query is used to modify the objects and provide the restriction for the objects.
HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is the object-oriented version of SQL. It generates database independent queries so that there is no need to write database-specific queries. Without this capability, changing the database would require individual SQL queries to be changed as well, leading to maintenance issues.

==Persistence==
Hibernate provides transparent persistence for Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). The only strict requirement for a persistent class is a no-argument constructor, though not necessarily . Proper behavior in some applications also requires special attention to the and methods in the classes. Hibernate recommends providing an identifier attribute, and this is planned to be a mandatory requirement in a future release.

Collections of data objects are typically stored in Java collection classes, such as implementations of the and interfaces. Java generics, introduced in Java 5, are also supported. Hibernate can be configured to lazy load associated collections. Lazy loading is the default as of Hibernate 3.

Related objects can be configured to &quot;cascade&quot; operations from one object to the other. For example, a parent class object can be configured to cascade its and operations to its child class objects.

==Integration==
Hibernate can be used both in standalone Java applications and in Java EE applications using servlets, EJB session beans, and JBI service components. It can also be included as a feature in other programming languages. For example, Adobe integrated Hibernate into version 9 of ColdFusion (which runs on J2EE app servers) with an abstraction layer of new functions and syntax added into CFML.

==Entities and components==
In Hibernate jargon, an &quot;entity&quot; is a stand-alone object in Hibernate&#x27;s persistent mechanism which can be manipulated independently of other objects. In contrast, a &quot;component&quot; is subordinate to an entity and can be manipulated only with respect to that entity. For example, an Album object may represent an entity; but the Tracks object associated with the Album objects would represent a &quot;component&quot; of the Album entity, if it is assumed that Tracks can only be saved or retrieved from the database through the Album object. Unlike J2EE, Hibernate can switch databases.

==History==
Hibernate was started in 2001 by Gavin King with colleagues from Cirrus Technologies as an alternative to using EJB2-style entity beans. The original goal was to offer better persistence capabilities than those offered by EJB2; by simplifying the complexities and supplementing certain missing features.

In early 2003, the Hibernate development team began Hibernate2 releases, which offered many significant improvements over the first release.

JBoss, Inc. (now part of Red Hat) later hired the lead Hibernate developers in order to further its development.

In 2005, Hibernate version 3.0 was released. Key features included a new Interceptor/Callback architecture, user defined filters, and JDK 5.0 Annotations (Java&#x27;s metadata feature). , Hibernate 3 (version 3.5.0 and up) was a certified implementation of the Java Persistence API 2.0 specification via a wrapper for the Core module which provides conformity with the JSR 317 standard.

In Dec 2011, Hibernate Core 4.0.0 Final was released. This includes new features such as multi-tenancy support, introduction of ServiceRegistry (a major change in how Hibernate builds and manages &quot;services&quot;), better session opening from SessionFactory, improved integration via &quot;org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator&quot; and auto discovery, internationalization support, message codes in logging, and a more distinction between the API, SPI or implementation classes.

In December 2012, Hibernate ORM 4.1.9 Final was released.

In Mar 2013, Hibernate ORM 4.2 Final was released.

In December 2013, Hibernate ORM 4.3.0 Final was released. It features Java Persistence API 2.1.

In September 2015, Hibernate ORM 5.0.2 Final was released. It has improved bootstrapping, hibernate-java8, hibernate-spatial, Karaf support.

In November 2018, Hibernate ORM 5.1.17 Final was released. This is the final release of the 5.1 series.

In October 2018, Hibernate ORM 5.3 Final was released. It featured Java Persistence API 2.2 inheritance caching.

In December 2018, Hibernate ORM 5.4.0 Final was released.

In October 2022, Hibernate ORM 6.1.4 Final was released.

==Application programming interface==

The Hibernate API is provided in the Java package .

===org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface===
The interface is the native equivalent version of the JPA&#x27;s standard .

===org.hibernate.Session interface===

The interface represents a Hibernate session, i.e., the main point of the manipulation performed on the database entities. The latter activities include (among the other things) managing the persistence state (transient, persisted, detached) of the objects, fetching the persisted ones from the database and the management of the transaction demarcation.

A is intended to last as long as the logical transaction on the database. Due to the latter feature, implementations are not expected to be thread safe nor to be used by multiple clients.

==Software components==
The Hibernate software includes the following components:
* Hibernate ORM (known as Hibernate Core before release 4.1) – the base software for an object–relational mapping solution for Java environments
* Hibernate Annotations (merged into Hibernate Core/ORM since version 3.6) – metadata that governs the transformation of data between the object-oriented model and the relational database model according to the JSR 317 Java Persistence API (JPA 2)
* Hibernate EntityManager (merged into Hibernate Core/ORM since version 5.2)– together with Hibernate Annotations, a wrapper that implements a JSR 317 Java Persistence API (JPA 2) persistence solution
* Hibernate Envers – auditing and versioning of persistent classes
* Hibernate OGM (Object/Grid Mapper) – an extension to store data in a NoSQL store
* Hibernate Shards – horizontal partitioning for multiple relational databases
** While Hibernate Shards is not compatible with 4.x releases of Hibernate Core, some of the Shards capability was integrated into Core in the 4.0 release
* Hibernate Search – integrates the full text library functionality from Apache Lucene in the Hibernate and JPA model
* Hibernate Tools – a set of tools implemented as a suite of Eclipse plugins and Ant tasks included in JBoss Developer Studio
* Hibernate Validator – the reference implementation of JSR 303 Bean Validation
* Hibernate Metamodel Generator – an annotation processor that creates JSR 317 Java Persistence API (JPA 2) static metamodel classes using the JSR 269 Pluggable Annotation Processing API
* NHibernate – an object–relational mapping solution for the .NET Framework

<text>Carl Nettles Reynolds (February 1, 1903 – May 29, 1978) was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago White Sox (1927–1931), Washington Senators (1932, 1936), St. Louis Browns (1933), Boston Red Sox (1934–1935) and Chicago Cubs (1937–1939). He was born in LaRue, Texas, and attended Southwestern University. Reynolds betted and threw right-handed.

==Career==
Reynolds was a consistent hitter who batted .300 six times. He played all three outfield positions, but was suited to right field, especially since he had a good throwing arm.

Reynolds enjoyed his best season in 1930, with career highs in batting average (.359), home runs (22), RBI (104), runs (103), hits (202), triples (18) and games played (138). On July 2, he hit three home runs, two of which were inside-the-park, in consecutive at bats. The feat was the first instance in MLB history to be done in each of the first three innings of a game.

In the first game of a Senators-Yankees doubleheader on July 4, 1932, Reynolds sustained a broken jaw when he was punched by Bill Dickey after a collision at home plate. Dickey was suspended for 30 days and fined $1000 and Reynolds did not play again until August 13.

In his 13-year career, Reynolds was a .302 hitter with 80 home runs and 699 RBI over 1,222 games. Defensively, he posted a .970 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions.

In November 1971, Reynolds was announced as one of five to be inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Reynolds died on May 29, 1978 at Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas after an extended illness at the age of 75.

<text>Peter Augustine Lawler (July 30, 1951May 23, 2017) was an American academic who was Dana Professor of Government at Berry College. He taught courses in political philosophy and American politics. 

He was executive editor of the quarterly journal &quot;Perspectives on Political Science&quot; and was a chairman of the politics and literature section of the American Political Science Association. He also served on the editorial board of the new bilingual critical edition of Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot;. Lawler also served on the editorial boards of several journals.

Upon his death, &quot;The Week&quot; penned an obituary, &quot;Why every smart liberal should read conservative philosopher Peter Lawler,&quot; recommending that, &quot;at a time when the post-Goldwater conservative movement finds itself increasingly eclipsed by right-wing populism, Lawler&#x27;s distinctive vision and voice may be more pertinent than ever.&quot;

==Career==
Lawler attended Allentown College in Center Valley, Pennsylvania and earned a PhD from the University of Virginia. He wrote or edited 15 books. His &quot;Modern and American Dignity&quot; was the reason he was chosen the 2010 Georgia Author of the Year. His books--&quot;Postmodernism Rightly Understood&quot;, &quot;Aliens in America&quot;, &quot;Stuck with Virtue&quot;, and &quot;Homeless and at Home in America&quot;—have been widely and positively reviewed. His &quot;American Political Rhetoric&quot; (edited with Robert Schaefer, seventh edition) is used in introductory American government courses at a sizeable number of colleges and universities. He was the 2007 winner of the Weaver Prize for Scholarly Excellence in promoting human dignity to a broad audience.

Lawler has spoken at roughly a hundred American colleges and universities and published well over two hundred articles, chapters, and reviews in a wide variety of venues. Over the last year alone, he gave nearly 30 lectures at various institutions and conferences. He was the 2015 Ross Lence Master Teacher at Residence at the Honors College at the University of Houston.

Lawler wrote broadly from a Catholic intellectual tradition that emphasizes the importance of limits on unfettered personal autonomy in shaping well-lived lives, as well as the centrality of the love of truth in making sense of the human experience and knowing &quot;who we are and what we are supposed to do.&quot; Lawler argued that moral anthropology suggests the possibility of God&#x27;s existence and love. His influences include both Catholics such as Augustine, Pierre Manent, Thomas Aquinas, Pascal, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Tocqueville and Walker Percy, as well as non-Catholic thinkers (especially Leo Strauss).

In 2004, Lawler was appointed to President Bush&#x27;s Council on Bioethics. He served until the council was terminated by President Obama in 2009.

In 2010, Lawler (with Marc Guerra of Assumption College) received a major grant from the Science of Virtues project at the University of Chicago for a series of path-breaking conferences at Berry College on the theme of &quot;Stuck with Virtue&quot;. This conferences has generated several important publications, including &quot;A Political Companion to Walker Percy&quot; (edited with Brian Smith) and &quot;Descartes, Locke, Darwin, and the Science of Modern Virtue&quot;.

Lawler also became a popular and influential blogger, at both &quot;Rightly Understood&quot; at &quot;Big Think&quot; and &quot;Postmodern Conservative,&quot; originally at &quot;First Things&quot; and then at &quot;National Review Online&quot;. His posts and short essays are often and widely reprinted. The first volume of his best short essays -- &quot;Allergic to Crazy&quot;—has been published by St. Augustine&#x27;s Press. And his &quot;American Heresies and Higher Education&quot; is forthcoming in 2016.

==Personal life==
Lawler was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on July 30, 1951, the son of Patricia Ann Fullerton Lawler and Thomas Comerford Lawler, the nephew of Ronald David Lawler, OFMCap, and the brother of Thomas Aquin &quot;Quin&quot; Lawler and Gregory Francis Lawler.

His father worked for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1951 to 1977, and also worked in patristics, serving as a co-editor, from 1964 to 1991, of the Ancient Christian Writers series published first by Newman Press, and then by Paulist Press. He likewise translated &quot;Saint Augustine: Sermons for Christmas and Epiphany&quot;, and &quot;The Letters of Saint Jerome&quot; for that series. With his brother, Father Roland, and the future cardinal, Donald Wuerl, he wrote an adult catechism, &quot;The Teaching of Christ&quot;.

Lawler died on May 23, 2017, aged 65, and was survived by his brothers, his wife, Rita Lawler, his daughter, Catherine Lawler Jackson, and his grandchildren, Henry Augustus Jackson and Molly Jackson.

<doc id="1329864" wikidata="Q61030" url="?curid=1329864" title="Karl von Bülow">
<text>Karl Wilhelm Paul von Bülow (24 March 1846 – 31 August 1921) was a German field marshal commanding the German 2nd Army during World War I from 1914 to 1915.

==Early life==
Bülow was born in Berlin on 24 March 1846 into a distinguished Prussian military family von Bülow, originally from Mecklenburg. He was a son of &quot;Marie&quot; Wilhelmine Friederike Johanna von Waldow (1817–1911) and Friedrich Heinrich Johann &quot;Paul&quot; von Bülow (1807–74), a Prussian Lieutenant colonel.

His paternal grandfather was Karl Johann Heinrich von Bülow (1769–1813), a Prussian major and commander of the Leibgrenadier battalion who was killed at Groß-Görschen during the German campaign of 1813.

==Career==

He enlisted in the Prussian Army and was assigned to the 2nd Guards regiment of infantry in 1864. He saw action during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and gained distinction at Königgrätz. Von Bülow served through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 as a junior officer, winning the Iron Cross Second Class. A Captain of the German General Staff in 1877, von Bülow was promoted to Colonel and assigned to the 9th Guards Regiment in 1894. In 1897, von Bülow was a major-general and became director of the Central Department in the German War Ministry. In 1900 he was promoted to lieutenant-general and in 1901 was appointed general commanding the Guards Division. He was Commander of the German III Corps from 1903 until his appointment as Inspector of the German 3rd Army in 1912.

===World War I===
Assigned to the German 2nd Army at the beginning of World War I in August 1914, von Bülow&#x27;s army was part of the German force that invaded Belgium. He occupied Liège on 7 August and captured the fortress of Namur on 22–23 August. In France, von Bülow defeated General Charles Lanrezac of the French Fifth Army at Charleroi on 23–24 August and again at Saint-Quentin on 29–30 August.

As the 2nd Army and General Alexander von Kluck&#x27;s 1st Army neared Paris from 31 August to 2 September, von Bülow, concerned about the growing gap between the two armies, ordered Kluck to turn the 1st Army on his right towards him. This decision, however, resulted in Kluck&#x27;s advancing south and east of Paris, instead of south and west as specified in the Schlieffen Plan. Von Bülow crossed the Marne on 4 September, but was ordered to retreat to the Aisne after the successful counterattack by combined French and British forces against Kluck&#x27;s 1st Army at the First Battle of the Marne from 5–10 September. Von Bülow was believed by the German public to be responsible for the German failure to capture Paris.

Von Bülow was promoted to Field Marshal in January of the following year. He suffered a heart attack two months later and a month after that, on 5 April 1915, he was awarded the Pour Le Mérite. He was allowed to retire in early 1916, living in Berlin until his death.

==Personal life==
In 1883, Bülow married Molly von Kracht in Potsdam. Together, they were the parents of one daughter and two sons, including diplomat (1891–1970).

<text>Richmond Mayo-Smith (February 9, 1854 – November 11, 1901) was an American economist noted for his work in statistics. He was born in Troy, Ohio, educated at Amherst College (graduating in 1875), then at Berlin and Heidelberg University. He became assistant professor of economics at Columbia University in 1877. He was an adjunct professor from 1878 to 1883, when he was appointed professor of political economy and social science, a post which he held until his death in 1901.

He devoted himself especially to the study of statistics, and was recognized as one of the foremost authorities on the subject. His works include &quot;Emigration and Immigration&quot; (1890); &quot;Sociology and Statistics&quot; (1895), and &quot;Statistics and Economics&quot; (1899).

<text>Kelheim () is a town and municipality in Bavaria, Germany. It is the capital of the district Kelheim and is situated at the confluence of the rivers Altmühl and Danube. Kelheim has a population of around 16,750 (2020).

==History==

Kelheim is the site of a large Iron Age oppidum from the La Tène period, which has been tentatively identified with the Celtic city of Alcimoennis mentioned by Ptolemy in his &quot;Geography&quot;. The ramparts of the fort cross the promontory between the rivers Altmühl and Danube. There is an inner defensive line enclosing 60 ha near the confluence, then a long outer rampart enclosing an enormous area of 630 ha. A small promontory fort on the other bank of the Danube has a series of short linear ramparts protecting a settlement in the bend of a meander. This is aligned with the end of the outer rampart on the far bank, dominating traffic on the river. Kelheim has given its name to the &quot;pfostenschlitzmauer&quot; style of rampart construction characterized by vertical wooden posts set into the stone facing.

Kelheim was first mentioned in the 9th century. At this time it was the seat of a count (Graf). According to tradition of Braunau in Rohr Abbey, Kelheim received borough rights in 1151. 

G. Schneider &amp; Sohn has a large weissbier brewery in the city.

<text>A film school is an educational institution dedicated to teaching aspects of filmmaking, including such subjects as film production, film theory, digital media production, and screenwriting. Film history courses and hands-on technical training are usually incorporated into most film school curricula. Technical training may include instruction in the use and operation of cameras, lighting equipment, film or video editing equipment and software, and other relevant equipment. Film schools may also include courses and training in such subjects as television production, broadcasting, audio engineering, and animation.

==History==

The formal teaching of film began with theory rather than practical technical training starting soon after the development of the filmmaking process in the 1890s. Early film theorists were more interested in writing essays on film theory than in teaching students in a classroom environment. The Moscow Film School was founded in 1919 with Russian filmmakers including Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Lev Kuleshov serving as faculty to disseminate their very distinct viewpoints on the purpose of film.

Those seeking to learn the technical craft of filmmaking in the early days of cinema were largely self-taught engineers or still photographers who experimented with new film technology. With the rise of commercial filmmaking in the 1920s, most notably the Hollywood studio system, those seeking to learn the technical skills of filmmaking most often started at the bottom of a hierarchical system and apprenticed under a more experienced person to learn the trade. Filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean started in this way, beginning as a title card designer and clapperboard assistant, respectively, in the early 1920s. The USC School of Cinematic Arts was founded in the midst of this Hollywood system in 1929, and continues to be widely recognized as one of the most prestigious film schools in the world. 
The University of Southern California was the first university in the country to offer a Bachelor of Arts degree in film.

The tradition of apprenticing up through a hierarchical system continues to this day within film studios and in television in many technical positions such as gaffers, grips, camera operators, and even into post-production with editing and color correction. Independent lower budget filmmaking in the post-war period using portable 16mm film cameras allowed filmmakers like John Cassavetes in the United States, along with members of the French New Wave and Italian Neorealism in Europe, to circumvent the classical system.

The notion of a granting a four-year college degree in film grew more popular in the 1960s with the founding of prestigious film departments like the New York University Tisch School of the Arts &quot;(1965)&quot;, Walt Disney founded California Institute of the Arts &quot;(1961)&quot;, the University of Texas department of Radio-Television-Film &quot;(1965)&quot; and the Columbia University School of the Arts &quot;(1965)&quot;. Over the years competition for admissions to these programs has steadily increased with many undergraduate programs accepting less than 10% of applicants, and with even more stringent selection for graduate programs.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the increased difficulties in getting into and the financial costs of attending these programs have caused many to spend their money self-financing their own features or attending a shorter trade school program for around the same costs. Film trade schools however rarely offer more than technical knowledge, and often cost more than a degree from a public university without providing the security of a four-year college degree to fall back on.

==Types of film schools==
A film school may be part of an existing public or private college or university, or part of a privately owned for-profit institution. Depending on whether the curriculum of a film school meets its state&#x27;s academic requirements for the conferral of a degree, completion of studies in a film school may culminate in an undergraduate or graduate degree, or a certificate of completion. Some institutions, both accredited and non-accredited, run shorter workshop and conservatory programs concurrent to longer degree courses.

Not only the types of courses on offer but also the content, cost, and duration of the courses differs greatly between larger institutions and bespoke film schools. Universities offer courses ranging from 1 to 4 years, with the majority lasting 3 or 4 years. Conversely, films schools focus on shorter technical courses of 1 or 2 years.

Many film schools still teach students how to use actual film in their productions, although the incorporation of digital media in film school curricula has risen drastically in recent years. Some schools offer only digital filmmaking courses, eschewing instruction in the medium of film altogether. The use of digital cameras and digital media is significantly less expensive than film cameras and film stock, and allows a film school or department to offer more equipment for students with which to learn and use for their projects. In addition, digital media (such as DVD) is often used for in-class screenings.

In recent years, online film schools of sorts have sprung up teaching filmmaking through articles, tutorial videos, and interactive forums. The next generation of digital cinematography using the large sensors and manual features available in still DSLR cameras has lowered the barrier further towards creating inexpensive digital video that compares closely to 35mm film.

==Benefits debated==
Professionals in the film industry hold a variety of opinions on the relevance of a degree in film in relation to the ability to find work and succeed in the field. As in many professions in the arts, some feel that talent cannot be taught. With respect to filmmaking, others feel that learning techniques and understanding the business is crucial to one&#x27;s success as a filmmaker.

Those who argue against the necessity of film school cite the high cost of such an education as prohibitive and assert that an aspiring filmmaker&#x27;s money would be better spent on the actual making of a film, the experience of which would offer a more practical hands-on education. At many film schools, including NYU and USC, initial student films in non-digital programs are shot with non-synch Arri-S or Bolex film cameras manufactured in the mid 20th century. These films are typically shot on black and white reversal film with no dialog, or limited sound added after shooting. Supporters argue that shooting films like these challenges students to creatively express their story without relying on dialog or other modern conventional devices. Opponents question the practicality of having students invest a substantial amount of money using equipment that is no longer used in the industry and doing simple filmmaking exercises that could be recreated for much less.

Film school proponents argue that a formal education allows for a more rounded theoretical understanding of techniques, and offers the opportunity to gain from the knowledge and experience of professional instructors who work in, or who have worked in, the industry. Often cited as another benefit of film school are the opportunities available to students to work as an intern for filmmakers or in related businesses, such as post-production editing facilities, and to network with others interested in filmmaking who may be in a position to collaborate with the student on a project or to eventually offer work in the industry. Most film schools will hold a festival, or showcase, of student works at the end of a semester or school year. The more prestigious institutions often invite industry executives and producers to attend. However, ambitious individuals not in film school can also pursue such opportunities on their own through cold-calling, joining film-industry-related organizations such as IFP, or submitting their work to independent film festivals.

The rise and popularity of independent filmmaking and digital video have influenced this debate, as anyone with a digital camera can shoot a digital work with little formal knowledge of the industry, and can succeed or establish a following by making the work available for viewing or by publicizing it on the internet.

Directors who have attended and earned degrees from film schools include Francis Ford Coppola (UCLA Film School, MFA film directing), Martin Scorsese (NYU Film School, MFA film directing), David Lynch (AFI Conservatory, MFA Film Directing), George Lucas (USC Film School, BA film directing) and Kathryn Bigelow (Columbia School of Arts, master&#x27;s degree in film theory and criticism). Others, such as Stanley Kubrick, Frank Capra, Pedro Almodóvar, Bernardo Bertolucci, Paul Thomas Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Quentin Tarantino, James Cameron, and Alfred Hitchcock had no formal college film training at all. Film director Werner Herzog has been quite vocal in arguing against film school.

<doc id="1329884" wikidata="Q5506056" url="?curid=1329884" title="Frontiero v. Richardson">
<text>Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case which decided that benefits given by the United States military to the family of service members cannot be given out differently because of sex. Frontiero is an important decision in several respects, including the fact that it informed the military establishment that in terms of pay, allowances and general treatment, women must be considered on an equal plane as men. However, the Court did not issue a broad decision requiring the military to prove in the courts its reasons for excluding women from combat positions.

==Background==
Sharron Frontiero, a lieutenant in the United States Air Force, applied for housing and medical benefits for her husband, Joseph, whom she claimed as a &quot;dependent.&quot; While servicemen could claim their wives as dependents and get benefits for them automatically, servicewomen had to prove that their husbands were dependent on them for more than half their support. Joseph did not qualify under this rule, and therefore could not get benefits. Sharron sued, and the case was appealed up to the Supreme Court. Lt. Frontiero was represented by Joseph J. Levin, Jr., of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who argued the case before the Court on her behalf. Future Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, representing the ACLU as &quot;amicus curiae&quot;, was also permitted by the Court to argue in favor of Frontiero. It was her first time giving an oral argument in front of the court. At the time Ginsburg was only a legal advocate on behalf of women&#x27;s rights. While prepping for the 1972 appeal in the case, the SPLC faction had reached out to Ginsburg for aid, with recognition to her partial victory in the &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot; case of only a year prior, 1971. Ginsburg argued for the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; classification to be upheld when looking at any case that was involved in gender discrimination. Her appearance before the court lasted in a 10 minute argument. Nearing the end, she said, “Asking the Court to declare sex a suspect criterion, amicus urges a position forcibly stated in 1837 by Sarah Grimké, noted abolitionist and advocate of equal rights for men and women,” Ginsburg stated. “She spoke not elegantly, but with unmistakable clarity. She said, ‘I ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.’” 

==Opinion of the Court==
In a plurality opinion written by Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr., the Supreme Court found the military&#x27;s benefit policy unconstitutional because there was no reason why military wives needed benefits any more than similarly situated military husbands. The Air Force argued that the policy was intended to save administrative costs by not forcing the military bureaucracy to determine that every wife was in fact a dependent. Justice Brennan dismissed this argument, saying that, although as an empirical matter more wives than husbands are dependent for support on their spouses, still, by automatically granting benefits to wives who might not truly be dependents, the Air Force might actually be &quot;losing&quot; money because of this policy—and the Air Force had not presented evidence to the contrary.

More importantly, the plurality argued for a strict standard of judicial scrutiny for those laws and regulations that classified on the basis of sex, instead of mere rational basis review. (See the appropriate section of the Equal Protection Clause article for more information on the different levels of Equal Protection scrutiny.) A heightened standard of review, the plurality argued, was needed due to America&#x27;s &quot;long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination&quot;:
[T]he sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society. As a result, statutory distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members. [Citations omitted.]

The plurality&#x27;s application of &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; was not adopted in subsequent cases for evaluating gender discrimination claims; instead, so-called &quot;intermediate scrutiny&quot; was adopted in &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; (1976).

===Concurring and dissenting opinions===
Justices Blackmun and Powell, and Chief Justice Burger concurred in the result, but, in an opinion written by Justice Powell, declined to decide whether discrimination on the basis of sex should attract strict scrutiny. Justice Powell gave two reasons for leaving this question open. First, that determination was not necessary to decide the case at bar, as the result was &quot;abundantly&quot; supported by the Court&#x27;s earlier decision in &quot;Reed v. Reed.&quot; Second, Justice Powell wrote that &quot;deferring&quot; on this question was supported by the ongoing debate about over the Equal Rights Amendment which, if adopted, would resolve the question precisely and &quot;represent the will of the people accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.&quot; Justice Stewart also concurred in the result, but said nothing about the Equal Rights Amendment; instead, he stated only that he agreed that the statutes in question &quot;work an invidious discrimination in violation of the Constitution.&quot; Justice Rehnquist dissented. Thus, Frontiero won her case by an 8 to 1 vote.

<text>The Federal Ministry of Finance (), abbreviated BMF, is the cabinet-level finance ministry of Germany, with its seat at the Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus in Berlin and a secondary office in Bonn.

==History==
In German politics, the Ministry of Finance beside the Interior, Foreign, Justice and Defence ministries is counted as one of the &quot;classical portfolios&quot; (denoted by the definite article &quot;der&quot;), which were also part of the first German government under Otto von Bismarck following the Unification of 1871.
Fiscal policy in the German Empire was predominantly the domain of the various states responsible for all direct taxation according to the 1833 &quot;Zollverein&quot; treaties. The federal government merely received indirect contributions from the states. Matters of fiscal policy at the federal level initially was the exclusive responsibility of the German Chancellery under Otto von Bismarck. However, in 1877 a special finance department was established, which with effect from 14 July 1879 was separated from the chancellery as the Imperial Treasury (&quot;Reichsschatzamt&quot;), a federal agency in its own right. With its seat vis-à-vis on Wilhelmplatz in Berlin, it was first headed by a subsecretary, and from 1880 by a State Secretary only answerable to the chancellor.

After World War I, the newly established Weimar Republic had to face huge reparations and a fiscal emergency. To cope with the implications, the former &quot;Reichsschatzamt&quot; in 1919 was re-organised as a federal ministry, the &quot;Reichsministerium der Finanzen&quot;, as supreme financial authority headed by a federal minister. Besides a Reich Treasury Ministry (&quot;Reichsschatzministerium&quot;) was established for the administration of the federal property, both agencies were merged in 1923.

Already in the German cabinet of Chancellor Franz von Papen, Undersecretary Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk was appointed Finance Minister in 1932, an office he held throughout the Nazi era until 1945. The ministry played a vital role in financing the German re-armament, in the &quot;Aryanization&quot; of Jewish property (&quot;Reich Flight Tax&quot;), German war economy, and the plundering of occupied countries in World War II. The budget deficit had already reached heady heights on the eve of the war, aggrandised by hidden Mefo and Oeffa bill financing. In turn, saving banks and credit institutions were obliged to sign war bonds while price stability was enforced by government intervention and the German public was called up to bank surplus money.

After World War II the ministry was re-established in 1949 and renamed the West German &quot;Bundesministerium der Finanzen&quot;. Since 1999, the Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus (former Air Ministry Building) in Berlin has been the headquarters of the ministry.

During the period of Reunification in the 1990s&#x27;, the Ministry of Finance headed by Theo Waigel, refused to return eight buildings in East Germany belonging to six Austrian Jewish citizens / NS victims. Allgemeine Judische Wochenzeitung; 10 September 1992; &quot;Expropriation through the back door; German Government adds to its coffers / Loopholes in German bureaucracy make Injustice permanent.&quot; (&quot;Enteignung durch die Hintertur; Der Bund bereichert sich / Winkelzuge deutscher Burocratie schreiben Unrecht fest&quot;).

== Structure and function ==

The Ministry is the supreme federal authority in revenue administration and governs a number of subordinate federal, intermediate, and local authorities such as the Federal Centre for Data Processing and Information Technology (ZIVIT). The Ministry&#x27;s wider portfolio includes public-law agencies and corporations such as the Federal Finance Regulator (BaFin) and Real Estate regulatory bodies. The finance minister is the only cabinet minister who can veto a decision of the government if it would lead to additional expenditure. The German newspaper FAZ stated, the Ministry of Finance is the most important Ministry in the German government.

The Finance Ministry is responsible for all aspects of tax and revenue policy in Germany and plays a significant role in European Union policy. It has nine directorates-general:

* Directorate-General Z (Central Services): Deals with all ministerial organizational matters, including human resources, IT, occupational training, management, and administration
* Directorate-General L (Leading, Strategy and communication): Coordinates strategy development and policy planning to advance decision-making processes, also manages the ministry&#x27;s relations with the parliament and federal cabinet
* Directorate-General I (Fiscal and Macroeconomic Affairs): Determines the strategic focus of the Ministry&#x27;s fiscal policy instruments, forecasts public budget trends and conducts macroeconomic research
* Directorate-General II (Federal Budget): Responsible for drawing up the federal budget by calculating revenue and spending for each government policy area.
* Directorate-General III (Customs and Excise): Responsible for levying customs and excise duties, as well as for monitoring cross-border goods traffic.
* Directorate-General IV (Taxation): Together with the other member states of the EU, the Ministry works to improve coordination among the different systems of taxes.
* Directorate-General V (Financial Relations and Law): Coordinates financial relations between central, regional and local governments. Also responsible for public law, legal affairs, and handling proceedings before Germany&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court and the European courts. Furthermore, this directorate-general deals with settlement of war burdens, compensation for National Socialist injustices, and unresolved property issues in eastern Germany
* Directorate-General VII (Financial Market Policy): Manages the federal debt, including issuance of securities for financial markets and private investors which ensure the budgeted volume of credit is obtained when needed and at market rates. Also responsible for the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank. Shapes the legal framework for financial markets through its capital market policy and exercises legal supervision over the German financial watchdog agency BaFin.
* Directorate-General VIII (Privatisation): Sets the policy for managing state holdings which is then undertaken by individual government departments. Operates a real estate institute that markets properties that the German Government no longer needs, and operates standardised facility management for federal properties.
* Directorate-General E (European Policy): Responsible for coordinating the German Government&#x27;s European economic and financial policy under the EU Treaty.

<doc id="1329895" wikidata="Q5304009" url="?curid=1329895" title="Dr. Caligari (film)">
<text>Dr. Caligari is a 1989 American avant-garde horror erotic film co-written and directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal, Laura Albert, Gene Zerna, David Parry, Fox Harris and Jennifer Balgobin. It is a quasi-sequel to the 1920 film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;. The film details a disturbed doctor (the granddaughter of the original Dr. Caligari) and her illegal experiments on her patients.

Originally and briefly billed as Dr. Caligari 3000 when it debuted at select theaters in 1989, the film promptly faded into obscurity. Since it was released on VHS and limited Betamax format, the title has been &quot;Dr. Caligari&quot;. The film is considered a cult classic and has been shown as a &quot;midnight movie&quot; at various times.

In the film, Dr. Caligari conducts mindswapping experiments on unwilling mental patients, in an attempt to cure them. She succeeds only in transferring certain mental conditions and character traits from one person to others. The main themes explored in these experiments are human cannibalism, nymphomania, and transvestism.

==Plot==
The main plot involves Dr. Caligari&#x27;s experiments with her patients at the C.I.A. (Caligari Insane Asylum), where she transfers glandular brain fluids from one patient to another. Two of her main patients, Mr. Pratt, a cannibalistic serial killer, and Mrs. Van Houten, a nymphomanical housewife, are the primary subjects of her mindswapping. Mrs. Van Houten becomes the cannibal and Mr. Pratt the nymphomaniac, although they seem to still retain some elements of themselves as well. Apparently, Caligari&#x27;s unconventional idea is to cure people by introducing equally opposite traits to balance out disturbed minds, but this is never explicitly stated in the film.

Several other doctors, a married couple (Mr. and Mrs. Lodger) become concerned with Caligari&#x27;s experiments and approach Mrs. Lodger&#x27;s father, Dr. Avol, who confronts Caligari only to fall victim to her mindswapping and receive an injection of Mrs. Van Houten&#x27;s brain fluid, turning him into a transvestite nymphomaniac.

Sex is a prominent theme throughout the movie, especially for Mrs. Van Houten, who appears topless and performs masturbation at several points, but there are no hardcore scenes, as this was released as an R-rated feature. By the end of the film, Mrs. Van Houten has injected Dr. Caligari with her own nymphomaniacal brain fluid and herself with Caligari&#x27;s ancestor&#x27;s (the original Dr. Caligari from &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;); thus the patient becomes the doctor, the doctor becomes the patient and the inmates are left to run the asylum.

==Release==
&quot;Dr. Caligari&quot; was shown at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on August 30, 1989.

==Critical reaction==
From a contemporary review, &quot;Devo.&quot; of &quot;Variety&quot; found the film to have a &quot;weak attempt&quot; at &quot;campy dialog and bizarre plot twists&quot; and that &quot;even discriminating cult movie mavens may sit this one out.&quot;

A retrospective review from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;One of the kinkiest artifacts ever to come out of Orange County has to be the movie &quot;Dr. Caligari.&quot;&quot;

==Home video==
The film was released in the United States on Laserdisc by Image Entertainment. At the same time, Shapiro Glickenhaus Entertainment released it on VHS. Excalibur Films, despite mostly dealing with pornographic film, released it on DVD on August 23, 2002. as the company was formed by the film&#x27;s executive producer. In 2023, Mondo Macabro released the film as a limited edition 4K Ultra HD.

<text>Kronach (East Franconian: &quot;Gronich&quot;) is a town in Upper Franconia, Germany, located in the Franconian Forest area. It is the capital of the district Kronach.

The town is equipped with a nearly complete city wall and Germany&#x27;s biggest and most complete early modern fortress, Rosenberg Fortress. The headquarters of German television and AV equipment manufacturer Loewe are located there.

==Geography==
===Location===
Kronach is located at the southwestern edge of the Franconian Forest. The rivers Haßlach, Kronach and Rodach unite in Kronach.

===Town districts===
Kronach is divided into the following districts:

* Bernsroth
* Birkach
* Blumau
* Dennach
* Dörfles
* Fischbach
* Friesen
* Gehülz
* Glosberg
* Gundelsdorf
* Höfles
* Kestel
* Knellendorf
* Kreuzberg
* Krugsberg
* Neuses
* Ruppen
* Seelabach
* Seelach
* Stübental
* Vogtendorf
* Vonz
* Wötzelsdorf
* Ziegelerden
==History==
The area of Kronach has been occupied for millennia, and in the late Bronze Age, the Heunischenburg, the oldest known stone fortification north of the Alps, was built nearby.

Kronach was first mentioned in a chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg in 1003 as &quot;urbs crana&quot;. In 1122, Holy Roman Emperor Henry V gifted Kronach and its surroundings (the &quot;praedium crana&quot;) to the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg. Kronach remained part of the Prince-Bishopric until its secularization in 1803. The town&#x27;s massive fortress originates from 1130, when Otto of Bamberg had a &quot;stone house and tower&quot; erected in Kronach. When Kronach gained town rights is unclear, but as its inhabitants were termed as &quot;citizens&quot; (&quot;cives&quot;) in a 1260 treaty, it can be assumed that it had attained rights before that date.

Kronach was put under siege by the Hussites in 1430. Although the defense was successful and the fortress remained unconquered, its inhabitants burned part of the town to block the invaders. This destruction caused discord among the town&#x27;s Burghers, which was only resolved through the intervention of the Prince-Bishop in 1439 through the conference of privileges to the Upper Town of Kronach.

With the Reformation in 1517, Kronach became an important border bulwark of the Catholic Prince-Bishopric against the newly Protestant Electorate of Saxony, this function continued until peace was made in 1648. This border function made thorough fortification necessary, and it was during this period that Rosenberg Fortress was expanded the most. However, many of the inhabitants of the town and its surroundings converted to Protestantism early on. Protestants were eventually expelled from the town by the early 17th century, following the maxim of &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio,&quot; and were only allowed back after the secularization in 1803.

During the German Peasant&#x27;s War, in 1525, the town and fortress surrendered to the peasant host, under the condition that the fortress would not be plundered. Following the intervention of the Swabian League, the peasants were forced out on 25 July, 1525.

Kronach was once again plunged into conflict in 1552, during the Second Margrave War. Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, attempted to put the town under siege but failed due to the insufficient size of his army. 

During the Bamberg witch trials, Kronach found itself at the center of witch hysteria, with several of its inhabitants being executed for alleged witchcraft. The trials were only ended by the Swedish invasion of Bamberg.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town experienced one of its most dramatic episodes. It was put under siege for two years, from 1632 to 1634, by a Swedish Army and its German allies, numbering between 3,000 and 5,000. Despite improbable odds, the town and fortress remained unconquered. Famously, after a Swedish sap tore a hole in the town wall in 1634, the Swedish soldiers were repulsed by the town&#x27;s women, who rained down boiling substances on them and forced them to retreat. The unlikely victory is, to this day, commemorated by a &quot;Swede&#x27;s Procession&quot; on the Sunday after Corpus Christi, where the citizens and clergy, led by women, march from the fortress to the town square. The siege also gave rise to a popular legend: allegedly, the siege finally ended after the citizens of Kronach let the last living animal in the town, a female rabbit (the &quot;Kroniche Housnküh&quot;) run free on the walls. This convinced the Swedes that the siege was hopeless, since Kronach had enough provisions to set a rabbit loose. The Kroniche Housnküh remains a mascot of the city. The siege is also commemorated, in a macabre manner, on the town&#x27;s greater coat of arms. The supporters of the shield are two flayed men: according to legend, saboteurs who were executed by the Swedes and their corpses sent back to the town gates. During the war, Kronach was struck twice by plague, in 1629 and 1634, killing circa 300 and circa 400 people respectively.

Kronach was once again put under siege by the Prussian Army during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Situated on the &quot;Kreuzberg,&quot; a hill overlooking the fortress, the Prussians attempted to use field artillery to destroy the fortress. However, their efforts proved insufficient, and the Prussians decided to bypass Kronach and march south.

In 1803, as a result of the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss,&quot; the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg was secularized, and Kronach was made part of the Electorate, later Kingdom of Bavaria. Kronach lost some of its privileges, and its town walls and fortress were no longer seen as modern or necessary, with parts of the former being reused or demolished.

In 1853, Kronach got its first rail line, and in 1866, its first train station. Today, it is a stop on the Franconian Forest Railway. In 1897, it was connected to the Bavarian telephone network.

During the First World War, the Fortress was the site of an officers&#x27; prisoner of war camp, in which, among others, a young Charles de Gaulle was interned from July 20 to November 21, 1917. Following two attempted escapes from the fortress, he was transferred to Ingolstadt Fortress. Kronach also hosted a hospital for wounded soldiers.

Due to its proximity to the early NSDAP stronghold of Coburg, Kronach fell under the influence of the Nazi Party early on. The first Nazi State Diet Fraction in Germany was founded at a hotel in Kronach, in the presence of Adolf Hitler, Julius Streicher, Hermann Esser, and other Nazis on July 28, 1925. The local SS division, founded later the same year, was one of the first in Germany. After years of steady Nazi growth, the town was fully put under the party&#x27;s control in March 1933.

The Jewish community of Kronach, which had existed since at least the 14th century and numbered 35 individuals in 1933, was destroyed by Nazi persecution. Synagogue services were ended in 1936, with the building being sold to the town, and the remaining Jewish families were deported starting in 1938. Those who did not emigrate were mostly murdered in concentration camps in 1941 and 1942.

The Subcamp Gundelsdorf, a subcamp of Flossenburg Concentration Camp, was situated in Gundelsdorf, today a town quarter of Kronach. Around 100 Polish Jews were imprisoned there and used as forced labor for the Luftwaffe. From 1942 to 1944, the Fortress was also used as a forced labor camp, originally producing industrial porcelain for Rosenthal and, by war&#x27;s end, producing the Messerschmidt Me 163 Komet in a specialized facility built into one of the Fortress&#x27; bastions.

Kronach was not subjected to mass air raids, and most of the town survived unharmed, although air raids targeting the town&#x27;s train station started in March 1945. Kronach refused to surrender to the advancing US Army, and was attacked by the 11th Armored Division of the Third Army under George Patton on the morning of April 12, 1945. After heavy fighting that resulted in the destruction of 15 buildings, the Americans marched into the town square in the evening of the same day.

After the end of the war, Kronach received thousands of East German emigrants, it also hosted deported Sudeten Germans from the former &quot;Landkreis&quot; of Podersam.
The town hosted the Bavarian Regional Garden Show in 2002, and celebrated its millennial anniversary in 2003.

<text>Maud de Chaworth (2 February 1282 – 3 December 1322) was an English noblewoman and wealthy heiress. She was the only child of Patrick de Chaworth. Sometime before 2 March 1297, she married Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, by whom she had seven children.

==Early life==
Maud was the daughter of Sir Patrick de Chaworth, Baron of Kidwelly, in Carmarthenshire, South Wales, and Isabella de Beauchamp. Her maternal grandfather was William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Her father died on 7 July 1283; he was thought to be 30 years old. His paternal line was from the Castle of Chaources, now Sourches, in the Commune of St. Symphorien, near Le Mans in the County of Maine at the time of the Angevin Empire. Three years later, in 1286, Isabella de Beauchamp married Hugh Despenser the Elder and had two sons and four daughters by him. This made Maud the half-sister of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Her mother died in 1306.

Maud was only a year old when her father died, and his death left her a wealthy heiress. However, because she was an infant, she became a ward of Queen Eleanor.

Queen Eleanor died in 1290. On 30 December 1292, King Edward I granted his brother Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, the right to arrange Maud&#x27;s marriage. Edmund arranged the marriage between Maud and one of his sons, Henry.

==Marriage and issue==
Henry and Maud were married sometime before 2 March 1297. Henry was a little older, having probably been born in 1280 or 1281. Maud brought her father&#x27;s property to the marriage, including land in Hampshire, Glamorgan, Wiltshire, and Carmarthenshire. Maud is often described as the &quot;Countess of Leicester&quot; or &quot;Countess of Lancaster&quot;, but she never bore the titles as she died in 1322, before her husband received them. 

Maud and Henry had seven children:
*Blanche (), Baroness Wake of Liddell
*Henry of Grosmont (–1361), Duke of Lancaster, one of the great English magnates of the 14th century
*Maud ( – 5 May 1377), Countess of Ulster
*Joan (–1345), married John de Mowbray, 3rd Baron Mowbray
*Isabel of Lancaster, Prioress of Amesbury ( – post-1347), prioress of Amesbury Priory
*Eleanor (1318–1372), married John de Beaumont, 2nd Baron Beaumont (died 1342), secondly Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel
*Mary (c. 1320–1362), married Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy

<doc id="1329901" wikidata="Q2482876" url="?curid=1329901" title="Yogaswami">
<text>Jnana guru Siva Yogaswami of Jaffna (1872–1964) was a spiritual master, a śivajnani and anatha siddhar revered by Hinduism of the 20th century. He had Catholic and Buddhist devotees as well. He was the 161st Jagadacharya of the Nandinatha Sampradaya&#x27;s Kailasa Parampara. Yogaswami was trained in and practiced Kundalini yoga under the guidance of Satguru Chellappaswami, from whom he received guru diksha (initiation).

==Biography==
Yogaswami was born near the Kandaswamy temple in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in 1872. He would later attend St Patrick&#x27;s College, Jaffna. His mother died before he turned 10 years old and his aunt and uncle took the responsibility of raising him. As a young adult, Yogaswami vowed to practice celibacy and renounced a place in his father&#x27;s business, as he could not spare time to meditate and study the scriptures.

In 1889, Swami Vivekananda paid a visit to Jaffna which had a deep impact on the 18-year-old yogi. During his visit, a large crowd took him in a festive procession along Colombuthurai Road. As he approached the illuppai tree (honey tree), which later became the site where Yogaswami performed his tapas, Vivekananda stopped the procession and got off his carriage. He explained that the area around the tree was sacred and he preferred to walk past it. He described it as an &quot;oasis in the desert&quot;.

The following day, Yogaswami went to listen to Vivekananda&#x27;s public speech. Vivekananda started his talk with the phrase &quot;The time is short but the subject is vast.&quot; This statement made a profound impact on Yogaswami&#x27;s mind. He repeated it like a mantra to himself and shared it with other devotees throughout his life. 

Around 1890, Yogaswami found a job as a storekeeper for an irrigation project in Kilinochchi. Here, he lived like a yogi, often meditating all night long. He demanded utter simplicity and purity of himself, as he would later of his devotees.

In 1905, Yogaswami found his guru Chellapaswami outside Nallur Temple. As he walked along the road, Chellappaswami shouted loudly, &quot;Hey! Who are you? There is not one wrong thing! It is what it is! Who knows?&quot; Suddenly everything vanished in a sea of light for the young yogi. At a later encounter in a festival crowd, Chellappaswami ordered him, &quot;Go within; meditate; stay here until I return.&quot; He came back three days later to find Yogaswami still waiting for his master. Soon afterwards, Yogaswami gave up his job and everything else to follow Chellappaswami for the next five years. His life became filled with intense spiritual discipline and severe austerity. Following Yogaswami&#x27;s ordination (&quot;sannyas diksha&quot;), his guru sent him away and never received him again. Chellapaswami died in 1915.

Yogaswami later spent years of intense tapas under the olive tree at Colombuthurai Road on the outskirts of Jaffna. His practice was to meditate for three days and nights in the open without moving or taking shelter from the weather. On the fourth day, he would walk long distances, returning to the olive tree to repeat the cycle. In his outward behavior, Yogaswami followed the example of his guru, for he would drive away those who tried to approach him. After some time, he finally allowed a few sincere seekers to approach. As more and more devotees gathered around him, his austere demeanor relaxed. He was eventually persuaded to occupy a small hut in the garden of a house near his olive tree. This remained his &quot;base&quot; for the rest of his life. Even here, he initially forbade devotees to revere or care for him. Devotees would come to him for help with all their problems, usually in the early mornings and in the evenings. Day and night, Yogaswami was absorbed in his inner worship. On one occasion, Yogaswami was seated in perfect stillness, like a stone. A crow flew down and rested for several minutes on his head, apparently thinking this was a statue.

In January 1935, Yogaswami had his devotees begin his monthly journal, Sivathondan, meaning both &quot;servant of Siva&quot; and &quot;service to Siva.&quot; As the years passed, his followers became more numerous. Swami relented a little, permitting them to express their devotion by cleaning and repairing his hut. Nearly all his devotees were householders and engaged in some form of employment or other. Apart from one or two exceptions, he rarely advised them to retire from their employment. For him, the whole of man&#x27;s life had to be made a spiritual practice, and he would not admit any division of human activity into holy and unholy.

In 1940, Yogaswami visited India on a pilgrimage to Banaras and Chidambaram. His letter from Banaras states, &quot;After wandering far in an earnest quest, I came to Kasi and saw the Lord of the Universe– within myself.&quot; The herb that you seek is under your feet. &quot; One day, he visited Ramana Maharshi at his Arunachalam Ashram. The two simply sat all afternoon, facing each other in silence. Not a word was spoken. Back in Jaffna he explained, &quot;We said all that had to be said.&quot;

In 1961, the 89-year-old Yogaswami broke his hip while feeding his cow, Valli. Swami spent months in the hospital, and once released, needed a wheelchair. He still meted out his wisdom and guidance throughout his final few years. At 3:30 am on a Wednesday in March 1964, Yogaswami passed away at age 91 in Colombuthurai. The whole nation of Sri Lanka stopped when the radio spread news of his Great Departure (&quot;mahasamadhi&quot;), and devotees thronged to Colombuthurai and Jaffna to bid him farewell. Today, a temple complex is being erected in Colombuthurai on the site of the hut where he lived for 50 years.

==Spiritual lineage==

He followed the Shaivism sect (Shaiva Siddhanta) of Hinduism, which is prevalent in South India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. He belonged to Nandinatha Sampradaya&#x27;s Kailasa Parampara.

Spiritual lineage : Maharishi Nandinath → Sundaranandar, Siddhar who later becomes Tirumular → → → Kadaitswami → Chellapaswami → Siva Yogaswami → Sivaya Subramuniyaswami → Bodhinatha Veylanswami


==Natchintanai==

Yogaswami conveyed his teachings in over 3,000 poems and songs, called &quot;Natchintanai&quot;, &quot;good thoughts,&quot; urging seekers to follow dharma and realise God within. These flowed spontaneously from him. Any devotee present would write them down, and he occasionally scribed them himself. &quot;Natchintanai&quot; teachings have been published in several books and through the primary outlet and archive of his teachings, the Sivathondan, a monthly journal he established in 1934 (see above). To this day, Yogaswami&#x27;s devotees intone &quot;Natchintanai&quot; songs during their daily worship. &quot;Natchintanai&quot; is a profound tool for teaching Hinduism&#x27;s core truths.

==Yogaswami&#x27;s message==
Yogaswami&#x27;s message to the world is &quot;Know thy Self by thyself&quot; (Thannai Ari-தன்னை அறி) and the path to realise the self is the &#x27;Sivathondu&#x27;. The one who is doing Sivathondu is called Sivathondan (Servant of Siva).

Four great sayings (maha-vakyas) in the Tamil language encapsulate his message:
* Oru Pollapum Illai: &quot;There is not even one wrong thing.&quot;
* Muzhuthum Unmai: &quot;All is truth.&quot;
* Eppavo mudintha kaariyam: &quot;It was all accomplished long ago.&quot;
* Naam Ariyom: &quot;We do not know.”

==Disciples==

Among the thousands of devotees of Sivayogaswamy, four disciples followed his path. One of the four was Markandu Swamy, who worked for the Department of Survey in Sri Lanka before moving to Kaithady Ashram. Yogaswamy remarked one day regarding Markandu Swamy, &quot;I kept him as a compass for you all.&quot; Indeed, Markandu Swamy was the perfect embodiment of the teachings of Yogaswamy.

The second of the four was Chellathurai Swamy, who was principal and later became a disciple of Yogaswamy. Chellathurai Swamy devoted his entire life to putting the correct path to Sivathondan Centers (Two Sivathondan Nilayam at Jaffna and Batticaloa) after attaining highest wisdom.

The third of the four was Santhaswamy, who was the son of Lord Viscount Soulbury, who was the last Governor-General of Ceylon during the British colonial period. His original name was James Ramsbotham and he had a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy. He dedicated his life to realizing the truth and highest wisdom, and to that end, he sought spiritual teachers in the west, including P. D. Ouspensky for a time. However, later on he found out about Yogaswamy, followed his path, and realised the self.

The fourth of the four was Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a young enlightened American in search of his guru. Yogaswami gave him the name Subramuniya. Jnanaguru Yogaswami initiated Subramuniya into the holy orders of sannyasa and ordained him into his lineage with a tremendous slap on the back. Subramuniya took Yogaswami&#x27;s message back to America. He fulfilled his mission by building two temples of his own, giving blessings to dozens of groups to build temples in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and elsewhere; he gifted Deity images to 36 temples to begin the worship and establishing the Hindu Heritage Endowment to support Hindu temples, organisations, relief efforts, publications and other institutions and projects worldwide. Yogaswami continued to communicate with Subramuniya through Kandiah Chettiar until his death in 1964. In the line of succession, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami was considered the 162nd Jagadacharya of the Nandinatha Sampradaya&#x27;s Kailasa Parampara.

Another disciple of Yogaswami was the late Pundit K N Navaratnam of Navalar Road, Jaffna. He emigrated to Melbourne, Australia and set up the Sivathondan Nilayam centre in Hallam, which has been running for over two decades. This meditation centre now has a temple precinct with a life-size lingam, rare vels and the Yogaswami vigraha. Pundit Navaratnam was a clairvoyant Vedic astrologer born on 4 March 1927, on the night of Shivaratri. He was the national astrologer of Sri Lanka and Australia. He has published several books, with two major works being The Numerical Key to Success and Junior Senior, both dedicated to his spiritual Guru Sri Yogaswami. Pundit Navaratnam attained nirvikalpa Samadhi on 6 December 2006.

<text>Mazamet (; Languedocien: &quot;Masamet&quot;) is a commune in the Tarn department in southern France.

It is the second-largest component of the Castres-Mazamet metropolitan area.

==Geography==
Mazamet is situated on the northern slope of the Montagne Noire and on the Arnette, a small tributary of the Thoré, which forms the commune&#x27;s northern border.

==Population==
==Economy==

The town made its wealth during the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was the world center of the wool industry. At its height, the town imported more than 100,000 tonnes of wool annually from the Southern Hemisphere. After processing, numerous establishments were involved in wool-spinning and in the manufacture of leather goods, gloves, blankets, hosiery and clothing for the troops. Mazamet was the biggest center of the wool pulling industry in Europe. In 1906, 95% of French workers in the industry were employed in Tarn. While the vast majority of Mazamet&#x27;s wool industry ended in the early 1990s, the town still has a residual high-end leather industry with leather being purchased by a number of Paris &amp; London fashion houses.

Today, Mazamet is known for tourism, thanks to its natural setting at the foothills of the Montagne Noire mountain range and being close to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Albi, Carcassonne and the Canal du Midi.

The town has a cycle path, plus numerous other cycling + walking routes.

<doc id="1329938" wikidata="Q154168" url="?curid=1329938" title="Toast (honor)">
<text>A toast is a ritual during which a drink is taken as an expression of honor or goodwill. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be &quot;the toast of the evening&quot;, for whom someone &quot;proposes a toast&quot; to congratulate and for whom a third person &quot;toasts&quot; in agreement. The ritual forms the basis of the literary and performance genre, of which Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;To the Babies&quot; is a well-known example.

The toast as described in this article is rooted in Western culture, but certain cultures outside that sphere have their own traditions in which consuming a drink is connected with ideas of celebration and honor. While the physical and verbal ritual of the toast may be elaborate and formal, merely raising one&#x27;s glass towards someone or something or clinking glasses with someone else&#x27;s and then drinking is essentially a toast as well, the message being one of goodwill towards the person or thing indicated.

==History==

According to various apocryphal stories, the custom of touching glasses evolved from concerns about poisoning. By one account, clinking glasses together would cause each drink to spill over into the others&#x27; (though there is no real evidence for such an origin). According to other stories, the word &quot;toast&quot; became associated with the custom in the 17th century, based on a custom of flavoring drinks with spiced toast. The word originally referred to the lady in whose honor the drink was proposed, her name being seen as figuratively flavoring the drink. The &quot;International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture&quot; says toasting &quot;is probably a secular vestige of ancient sacrificial libations in which a sacred liquid was offered to the gods: blood or wine in exchange for a wish, a prayer summarized in the words &#x27;long life!&#x27; or &#x27;to your health!

==Situations==
Toasts are generally offered at times of celebration or commemoration, including certain holidays, such as New Year&#x27;s Eve. Other occasions include retirement celebrations, housewarming parties, births, etc. The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed. At a wedding reception, the father of the bride, in his role as host, regularly offers the first toast, thanking the guests for attending, offering tasteful remembrances of the bride&#x27;s childhood, and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together. The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds. A best man&#x27;s toast takes the form of a short speech (3–5 minutes) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity. The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom&#x27;s expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom, amongst others. The actual &quot;toast&quot; is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy, healthy, loving life together. The maid of honor may follow suit, appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride. The groom may offer the final toast, thanking the bride&#x27;s parents for hosting the wedding, the wedding party for their participation, and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids.

Typical traditional wedding toasts include the following:
Toasts are also offered on patriotic occasions, as in the case of Stephen Decatur&#x27;s famous &quot;Our country! In our intercourse with foreign nations may we always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong.&quot; Equally traditional are satiric verses:
==Norms and etiquette of toasting==

Toasts may be solemn, sentimental, humorous, bawdy, or insulting. The practice of announcing one&#x27;s intention to make a toast and signalling for quiet by rapping on the wineglass, while common, is regarded by some authorities as rude. Except in very small and informal gatherings, a toast is offered standing. At a gathering, none should offer a toast to the guest of honor until the host has had the opportunity to do so. In English-speaking countries, guests may signal their approval of the toast by saying &quot;hear hear&quot;. The person honored should neither stand nor drink, but after the toast should rise to thank the one who has offered the toast and take a drink, perhaps but not necessarily offering a toast in turn. As toasts may occur in long series, experienced attendees often make sure to leave enough wine in the glass to allow participation in numerous toasts.

Putting one&#x27;s glass down before the toast is complete, or simply holding one&#x27;s glass without drinking is widely regarded as impolite, suggesting that one does not share the benevolent sentiments expressed in the toast, nor the unity and fellowship implicit in toasting itself. Even the non-drinker is counseled not to refuse to allow wine to be poured for a toast. Inverting the glass is discouraged.

Toasting traditionally involves alcoholic beverages. Champagne (or at least some variety of sparkling wine) is regarded as especially festive and is widely associated with New Year&#x27;s Eve and other celebrations. Many people nowadays substitute sparkling fruit juice (often packaged in champagne-style bottles), and many authorities consider it perfectly acceptable to participate in a toast while drinking water. Toasting with an empty glass may be viewed by some as acceptable behavior for the non-drinker, though feigning to drink from such a glass would likely be seen as ridiculous. The person giving the toast should never do so with an empty glass, even if the glass contains nothing more than water.

Teetotalers may view the drinking of toasts to be abominable and incompatible with their stand, as witnessed by this narrative from &quot;The Teetotaler&quot; (1840):
At the anniversary of Cheshunt College, Sir Culling Eardley Smith was in the chair. This gentleman, after dinner, said &quot;he had subscribed to the Teetotal Pledge, which of course was incompatible with the drinking of toasts;&quot; when the Rev. J. Blackburn, (minister of Claremont Chapel, Pentonville,) said &quot;he was not a teetotaler,—&quot;he was not in bondage,&quot;—and on that subject he had very recently been preaching.&quot; What could the Rev. Gentleman mean by this, but that he had recently been preaching against Teetotalism? Let the Rev. Gentleman look at drinking customs and their enormous evils, and ask himself if he has done his duty; or whether he expects to be pronounced &quot;a good and faithful servant&quot;, if he continues even from the pulpit to encourage the great damning evil of this nation. Mr. Donaldson said that he was happy to add, that one of the most popular ministers of the day, the Rev. J. Sherman, gave Mr. B. a pretty severe and well-merited reply, by saying, &quot;His brother Blackburn had said, he (Mr. B.) was not in bondage; he must be allowed to say, that he rejoiced that he (Mr. S.) had been enabled to break through the old and stupid custom of washing down sentiments by draughts of intoxicating liquors. &quot;He had thus become a free man.&quot;

Mr. Donaldson concluded with some very severe animadversions upon the infamous conduct of Mr. Blackburn.
It is a superstition in the Royal Navy, and thus the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Navies as well as the United States Navy that a toast is never to be made with water, since the person so honored will be doomed to a watery grave. During a United States Air Force Dining In, all toasts are traditionally made with wine except for the final toast of the night made in honor of POWs/MIAs; because these honorees did not have the luxury of wine while in captivity, the toast is made with water. Some versions of the protocol prescribe a toast in water for all deceased comrades.

It is or was the custom in the (British) Royal Navy to drink the Loyal toasts sitting, because in old-type wooden warships below decks there was not enough headroom to stand upright.

==L&#x27;Chaim==
L&#x27;Chaim in Hebrew is a toast meaning &quot;to life&quot;. When a couple becomes engaged, they get together with friends and family to celebrate. Since they drink &quot;l&#x27;chaim&quot; (&quot;to life&quot;), the celebration is also called a l&#x27;chaim.

The origins of the custom to toast this way may be traced to an account described in the Talmud, where R. Akiva said upon pouring cups of wine poured at a banquet a benediction of &quot;Wine and life to the mouth of the sages, wine and life to the mouth of the sages and their students.&quot; Many reasons for this custom have been offered. One reason based on the Zohar is to wish that the wine would be tied to the tree of life and not to the tree of death with which Eve had sinned. A second reason brought forward is that there was a common practice to make people who intend to kill drink wine and thereby be calmed, and therefore there is a custom to proclaim &quot;to life!&quot; over wine in the hope that it will prevent bloodshed. A third reason is that wine was created to comfort those who are in mourning (based on Proverbs 31:6) and there emerged a practice to toast thus when drinking in sad times in the hope that one day the drinker will drink wine in good happy times, and the practice of toasting this way subsequently extended to all situations.

==The German word &quot;prost&quot;==
=== Prosit/Prost ===
Prosit is a Latin word, meaning roughly &quot;be well&quot;, which is a toast in Latin and modern Italian, from which the German short form &quot;prost&quot; is derived. This is a toast in German. The expression dates back to the beginning of the 18th century when it was used among university students and eventually made its way into everyday language. In a ceremonious context and in connection with a short speech, the English word &quot;toast&quot; may also be used.

The Latin word comes from the verb &quot;prodesse&quot; (= &quot;to benefit sth/sb&quot;, &quot;to be beneficial&quot;). Consequently, &quot;prosit&quot; is the conjugated form (3rd person Singular, Present Subjunctive, Active) and therefore an optative: &quot;To you/ to your health&quot;. Like the colloquial &quot;prost&quot;, &quot;prosit&quot; was originally used by university students.

=== Usage ===
In German, synonyms like &quot;Wohl bekomm&#x27;s!&quot;, &quot;Zum Wohl!&quot;, and many versions from other languages may also be used instead of &quot;prosit&quot;. The acclamation itself is also referred to as a &quot;prosit&quot;. The verb form is &quot;zuprosten&quot;, where the prefix &quot;zu&quot; means that the speech act is targeted at one or several people.

In the Swabian dialect, the word has the further meaning of a belch, called a &quot;Prositle&quot;. The acclamation is followed by the clinking of glasses, often linked to other rules like making eye contact. This ritual is commonly attributed to a medieval custom, whereby one could avoid being poisoned by one&#x27;s drinking companions, as a few drops of each beverage got mixed when clinking glasses. There is every likelihood that this did not work. It was much more effective for one table to share one or more drinking vessels, a procedure which was common for a long time.

In Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, &quot;prosit&quot; is a blessing used in response to a sneeze, in the same way the English expression &quot;bless you&quot; is used.

In Germany, toasting, not necessarily by words but usually just by touching each other&#x27;s drinking vessels, is usually a very closely observed part of culture. In private company, no one should drink a sip of alcohol before having toasted all the other people at the table. In doing this, it is very important to look directly into the other drinker&#x27;s eyes. Not practising this is considered rude and often, humorously, believed to attract all kinds of bad luck (e.g. &quot;seven years of bad luck&quot; and the like).

==Traditional toasts==
In the British Royal Navy, the officers&#x27; noon mess typically began with the loyal toast, followed by a toast distinctive for the day of the week:

* Monday: Our ships at sea.
* Tuesday: Our sailors (formerly Our men but changed to include women).
* Wednesday: Ourselves. (&quot;As no-one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare&quot; is often the retort and not part of the toast)
* Thursday: A bloody war or a sickly season (meaning the desire and likelihood of being promoted when many people die: during war or sickness).
* Friday: A willing foe and sea room.
* Saturday: Our families (formerly &quot;Our wives and sweethearts&quot;, with the retort of &quot;may they never meet&quot;).
* Sunday: Absent friends.

The sequence was also prescribed in at least one publication for the United States Navy.

A toast might be spontaneous and free-form, a carefully planned original speech, or a recitation of traditional sentiments such as this Irish example:

==Toasts worldwide==

In various cultures worldwide, toasting is common and to not do so may be a breach of etiquette. The general theme of a toast is &quot;good luck&quot; or &quot;good health&quot;. At formal meals in certain countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, the first toast to be proposed is traditionally the Loyal Toast (&quot;The King&quot;). This may be adapted in other countries to give a loyal toast to the appropriate head of state.

<doc id="1329947" wikidata="Q835142" url="?curid=1329947" title="UK Music Hall of Fame">
<text>The UK Music Hall of Fame was an awards ceremony to honour musicians, of any nationality, for their lifetime contributions to music in the United Kingdom. The hall of fame started in 2004 with the induction of five founder members and five more members selected by a public televote, two from each of the last five decades. In subsequent years, a panel of more than 60 journalists and music industry executives decided the people and groups to be inducted. The ceremony was last held in 2006, and has since been cancelled.

==2004 inductees==
There were five founding members, one from each decade from the 1950s to 1990s:
*Elvis Presley
*The Beatles
*Bob Marley
*Madonna
*U2

In addition, the public were asked to select one further act from each decade, from five lists of ten nominees. The five members chosen by the public in October 2004 were:
*Cliff Richard and the Shadows
*The Rolling Stones
*Queen
*Michael Jackson
*Robbie Williams

The full list of nominees were:

*1950s - Billie Holiday, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Little Richard, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis
*1960s - The Beach Boys, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, the Supremes, the Rolling Stones, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, the Kinks, Simon and Garfunkel, the Velvet Underground
*1970s - Pink Floyd, ABBA, the Bee Gees, the Clash, David Bowie, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Queen, the Sex Pistols, Stevie Wonder
*1980s - Bruce Springsteen, Beastie Boys, George Michael, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Joy Division, Michael Jackson, Prince, Public Enemy, R.E.M., the Smiths
*1990s - Blur, Dr. Dre, Missy Elliott, Nirvana, Oasis, the Prodigy, Radiohead, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Robbie Williams, the Spice Girls

Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, was awarded honorary membership.

==2005 inductees==
The 2005 inductees were selected by a panel of 60 people from the music industry:
*Pink Floyd (inducted by Pete Townshend of the Who)
*Eurythmics (inducted by Bob Geldof, performed)
*Aretha Franklin
*Jimi Hendrix (inducted by Mitch Mitchell, and Slash of hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses and supergroup Velvet Revolver)
*Bob Dylan (inducted by Woody Harrelson)
*Joy Division/New Order (inducted by actor John Simm, performed &quot;Regret&quot; and &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;)
*The Who (inducted by Ray Davies of the Kinks)
*The Kinks (inducted by footballer Geoff Hurst)
*Black Sabbath (inducted by Brian May of Queen, performed)
*Ozzy Osbourne solo (inducted by Angus Young of AC/DC)

The late DJ John Peel was also made an honorary member (inducted by Damon Albarn of Blur).

The programme was televised in the UK. It was later shown on VH1 in the United States, without the Joy Division/New Order segments. The full version was subsequently shown on VH1 Classic.

==2006 inductees==
The 2006 inductees were:
*James Brown (inducted by Jazzie B, performed &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot;)
*Led Zeppelin (inducted by Roger Taylor of Queen, Wolfmother performed &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; as tribute)
*Rod Stewart (inducted by James Morrison who performed &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; / &quot;Do Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy&quot;)
*Brian Wilson (inducted by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, performed &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;)
*Bon Jovi (inducted by David A. Stewart and Kara DioGuardi, performed &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;)
*Prince (inducted by Beyoncé)
*Dusty Springfield (inducted by Joss Stone who performed &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;)

George Martin received an honorary membership (inducted by the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Prime Minister Gordon Brown). He then went on to conduct a special arrangement of the Beatles songs &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; / &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; / &quot;The End&quot;; with the help of Johnny Borrell, Corinne Bailey Rae, José González, Roger Taylor and the London Community Gospel Choir. The band were also joined by Dean Tidey.

Also present at the ceremony were Patti LaBelle (performed &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot;), Nona Hendryx, Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath), Wolfmother, Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), Mark Hudson, Lemar, Trevor Nelson, Trevor Francis, Giles Martin, Dermot O&#x27;Leary (host), and Paul Gambaccini.

Prince, during his induction, invited everyone over to see him live in Las Vegas but gave an apology that he could not perform live at the venue. Rod Stewart appeared live by satellite from Los Angeles in a Celtic shirt and accidentally dropped his award, before advising James Morrison to &#x27;give up the fags&#x27;.

The event has particular significance as it turned out to be James Brown&#x27;s final televised recording, as he died on 25 December 2006.

The 2006 Induction Ceremony took place on 14 November 2006 at Alexandra Palace, and it was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on 16 November, repeated on 18 November. It was shown on VH1 in the USA on 25 November.

==Cancellation==
There were no inductees in 2007. It was announced in September 2008 that Channel 4 had axed the ceremony, partly due to lack of funding, and also because a two-year gap since the last show was &quot;too long&quot;.

<doc id="1329951" wikidata="Q5181633" url="?curid=1329951" title="Craig v. Boren">
<text>Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause. The case was argued by future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg while she was working for the American Civil Liberties Union.

== Background ==
An Oklahoma statute prohibiting the sale of &quot;nonintoxicating&quot; 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 but allowed females over the age of 18 was challenged as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma in 1971.

Curtis Craig was a Freshman in College at Oklahoma State University at the time. Both Curtis Craig and Carolyn Whitener were friends of a man named Mark Walker who was one of the first people to challenge the law. Craig joined the case because Walker had turned 21 and no longer had standing to sue. Carolyn Whitener owned a drive-in convenience store called the Honk N Holler. Whitener, as a licensed vendor, became the sole plaintiff.

The nominal defendant was David Boren, who was sued &quot;ex officio&quot; by virtue of his serving as Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the lawsuit. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, working as an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, advised the plaintiff&#x27;s attorney, submitted an amicus brief, and was present at the counsel table during oral argument before the Supreme Court.

The District Court dismissed the action and the Supreme Court reversed.

== Decision ==
Justice William J. Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court in which he was joined by justices White, Marshall, Powell and Stevens (Justice Blackmun joined all but one part of the opinion, and Blackmun, Powell, Stevens, and Stewart wrote concurrences).

===Majority opinion===
The Court held that the gender classifications made by the Oklahoma statute were unconstitutional because the statistics relied on by the state were insufficient to show a substantial relationship between the statute and the benefits intended to stem from it.

The Court instituted a standard, dubbed &quot;intermediate scrutiny,&quot; under which the state must prove the existence of specific important governmental objectives, and the law must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.

Both Craig and Whitener used a 1971 Supreme Court case, &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot;, in which the Oklahoma legislature had equalized the age for the purchase of alcohol, setting both at 18, but changed it when they faced a challenge from anti-liquor forces. &quot;Reed&quot; set the precedent that classification by gender must substantially further important government objectives, which Craig and Whitener used to claim Oklahoma did not meet the requirements to impose their alcohol law based on that precedent.

First the Court decided that Craig did not have standing to sue because he turned 21 before the Supreme Court heard the case. Next, the Court decided if Whitener had third-party standing. To have standing, one must show a &quot;nexus&quot; of the injury to oneself and the constitutional violation of the statute. In this case, the statute directly affected Whitener only economically, but the Supreme Court explained that Whitener and other vendors have standing under the precedent of &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; to assert the concomitant rights of other parties, such as Craig.

The Court acknowledged that &quot;vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operation by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function.&quot; Although Baird was not a vendor of contraceptives the Court explains that standing in that case was because of &quot;the impact of the litigation on the third-party interests&quot; and enforcement of the statute would &quot;materially impair the ability of single persons to obtain contraceptives&quot; and enforcement in this case would impair the ability of males 18-20 years of age to purchase 3.2% beer. The statute regulated distribution but not use &quot;leaving a vendor as the obvious claimant&quot;. 

===Concurring opinion===
Justice Blackmun wrote a concurring opinion, agreeing that a higher standard of scrutiny was appropriate. Blackmun disagreed with the discussion of the Twenty-First Amendment.

=== Dissenting opinions ===
Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist dissented.

Rehnquist dissented because he felt that the law needed to pass only &quot;rational basis,&quot; as previous cases in the area, such as &quot;Stanton v. Stanton&quot;, had used only the &quot;rational basis&quot; test.

Burger was &quot;in general agreement with Mr. Justice Rehnquist&#x27;s dissent&quot; but penned a separate dissent to emphasize that &quot;a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities.&quot; He felt that the indirect economic injury to Whitener and other vendors introduced &quot;a new concept of constitutional standing to which I cannot subscribe.&quot;

=== Subsequent ===
As a result of &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; and &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot;, Congress later passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act which penalized states 10% of their allotted Federal highway funds if they had a minimum drinking age below 21. This act was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court in &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;.

<text>Notepad++ (sometimes npp or NPP), is a text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in one window. The program&#x27;s name comes from the C postfix increment operator.

Notepad++ is released as free and open-source software under a GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0 or later. At first, the project was hosted on the SourceForge software repository (2003–2010), from where it was downloaded over 28 million times, and twice won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer Tool. Then, the project moved to TuxFamily (2010–2015), and then to GitHub (2015–present). Notepad++ uses the Scintilla editor component.

==History==
Notepad++ development began in September 2003 by Don Ho, a former Paris Diderot University computer science student. Ho first used JEXT (a Java-based text editor) at his company but, dissatisfied with its poor performance, he began to develop a text editor written in C++ with Scintilla. He developed it in his spare time since the idea was rejected by his company. Notepad++ was built as a Microsoft Windows application; the author considered, but rejected, the idea of using wxWidgets to port it to the Mac OS X and Unix platforms.

Notepad++ was first released on SourceForge on 25 November 2003, as a Windows-only application.&lt;ref name=&quot;theinitialcommit/don-ho&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the Scintilla editor component, and is written in C++ with only Windows API (Win32) application programming interface (API) calls using only the Standard Template Library (STL) to increase performance and reduce program size.

In January 2010 the US government obliged US-based open source project hosts to deny access from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria to comply with U.S. law. As a response to what the developer felt was a violation of the free and open-source software (FOSS) philosophy, in June 2010 Notepad++ moved out of US territorial jurisdiction by releasing a version on TuxFamily, in France. Some community services of Notepad++ (such as the forums and bug tracker) remained on SourceForge until 2015 when Notepad++ left SourceForge completely.

In 2011 &quot;Lifehacker&quot; described Notepad++ as &quot;The Best Programming Text Editor for Windows&quot;, stating that &quot;if you prefer a simple, lightweight, and extensible programming plain-text editor, our first choice is the free, open-source Notepad++&quot;. &quot;Lifehacker&quot; criticized its user interface, stating that &quot;It is, in fact, fairly ugly. Luckily you can do a lot to customize its looks, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in functionality&quot;.

In 2014 &quot;Lifehacker&quot; readers voted Notepad++ as the &quot;Most Popular Text Editor&quot;, with 40% of the 16,294 respondents specifying it as their most-loved editor. The Lifehacker team summarized the program as being &quot;fast, flexible, feature-packed, and completely free&quot;.

In 2015 Stack Overflow conducted a worldwide Developer Survey, and Notepad++ was voted as the most used text editor worldwide with 34.7% of the 26,086 respondents claiming to use it daily. Stack Overflow noted that &quot;The more things change, the more likely it is those things are written in JavaScript with NotePad++ on a Windows machine&quot;. The 2016 survey had Notepad++ at 35.6%.

In 2015, in response to the staff hijacking of projects hosted on SourceForge, Notepad++ left SourceForge completely with the forums being moved to NodeBB and the bug tracker to GitHub. In 2019, the website, &quot;notepad-plus-plus.org&quot;, moved to Hostinger.

== Features ==
Notepad++ is a source code editor. It features syntax highlighting, code folding and limited autocompletion for programming, scripting, and markup languages, but not intelligent code completion or syntax checking. As such, it may properly highlight code written in a supported schema, but whether the syntax is internally sound or compilable, cannot be verified. As of version 7.6.3, Notepad++ can highlight the elements of 78 syntaxes:

*ActionScript
*Ada
*ASN.1
*ASP
*Assembly
*AutoIt
*AviSynth scripts
*BaanC
*batch files
*Blitz Basic
*C
*C#
*C++
*Caml
*CMake
*Cobol
*CoffeeScript
*Csound
*CSS
*D
*Diff
*Erlang
*escript
*Forth
*Fortran
*FreeBASIC
*Gui4Cli
*Haskell
*HTML
*INI files
*Intel HEX
*Inno Setup scripts
*Java
*JavaScript
*JSON
*JSP
*KiXtart
*LaTeX
*Lisp
*Lua
*Makefile
*MATLAB
*MMIX
*Nim
*nnCron
*NSIS scripts
*Objective-C
*OScript
*Pascal
*Perl
*PHP
*PostScript
*PowerShell (Broken)
*PureBasic
*Python
*R
*Rebol
*Registry script (.reg)
*Resource file
*Ruby
*Rust
*Scheme
*Shell script
*Smalltalk
*SPICE
*SQL
*Swift
*S-Record
*Tcl
*Tektronix HEX
*TeX
*txt2tags
*TypeScript
*Visual Basic
*Visual Prolog
*VHDL
*Verilog
*XML
*YAML

The language list also displays two special-case items for ordinary plain text: &quot;Normal text&quot; (default) or &quot;MS-DOS Style&quot;, which tries to emulate DOS-era text editors.

Notepad++ has features to consume and create cross-platform plain text files. It recognizes three newline representations (, , and ) and can convert between them on the fly. In addition, it supports reinterpreting plain text files in various character encodings and can convert them to ASCII, UTF-8 or UCS-2. As such, it can fix plain text that seem gibberish only because their character encoding is not properly detected.

Notepad++ also has features that improve plain text editing experience in general, such as:
* Autosave
* Finding and replacing strings of text with regular expressions
* Searching text strings within opened tabs
* Searching text strings in a directory
* Guided indentation
* Line bookmarking
* Macros
* Simultaneous editing
* Split screen editing and synchronized scrolling
* Line operations, including sorting, case conversion (Uppercase, lowercase, camel case, sentence case), and removal of redundant whitespace
* Tabbed document interface

=== Plugins ===
Notepad++ has support for macros and plugins, and has been remarked for its robust plugin architecture which enabled various new features to be integrated into the program. Currently, over 140 compatible plugins are developed for Notepad++, 10 of which are included by default in the program. The first plugin to be included in the program was &quot;TextFX&quot;, which includes W3C validation for HTML and CSS, text sorting, character case alteration and quote handling.

=== Internationalization ===
Notepad++ supports internationalization through XML files in an application-specific format containing all internationalized strings (dialog captions, menu titles and items, etc.) in a certain language; this file can be reloaded from the application settings. Translations to new languages can thus be written by simply editing an existing file.

== Political messaging ==
Notepad++ is notable for being vocal in politics, particularly in human rights and opposition to war.

In March 2008, the &quot;Boycott Beijing 2008&quot; banner was placed on Notepad++&#x27;s SourceForge.net homepage. A few months later most users in China were unable to reach the SourceForge.net website from 26 June to 24 July 2008. This led to the widespread belief that China had banned SourceForge.net in retaliation for the Boycott banner.

In January 2015, the Notepad++ website was hacked by activists from the Fallaga Team who objected to an Easter egg endorsing Je suis Charlie. The Fallaga Team has been linked to ISIL and is also believed to be responsible for the 2017 hacking of websites of the British National Health Service.

In October 2019, Notepad++ released a version codenamed &quot;Free Uyghur&quot; (v7.8.1). In the release notice, the author expressed concern that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs have been &quot;subjected to political indoctrination, and sometimes even torture&quot; in the Xinjiang re-education camp. He called for &quot;additional pressure on the Chinese government to stop their oppressive actions and crimes concerning the Uyghur people&quot;. The software&#x27;s dedicated site came under a distributed-denial-of-service attack and its GitHub issue page was bombarded with nationalistic rhetoric, though it later recovered after being moved behind Cloudflare&#x27;s anti-DDoS service.

In July 2020, Notepad++ released a version codenamed &quot;Stand with Hong Kong&quot; (v7.8.9). In the release notice, the author expressed his concern about the Chinese government implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong. In retaliation, mainland Chinese browsers developed by Tencent (QQ Browser and WeChat&#x27;s built-in browser), Alibaba (UC Browser), 360 and Sogou started blocking the official site&#x27;s &quot;Download&quot; page, but not other pages.

In early and mid-February 2022, Notepad++ released a version codenamed &quot;Boycott Beijing 2022&quot; (v8.3) and (v8.3.1). In the release notice, the author expressed his concern about human rights in China, especially for Uyghurs and Hongkongers. He suggest his audience &quot;not watch or pay attention to the games&quot;.

In late February 2022, Notepad++ released a version codenamed &quot;Declare variables, not war&quot; (v8.3.2). In the release notice, the author condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and called for support for Ukraine. In March 2022, Notepad++ released a version codenamed &quot;Make Apps, not war&quot; (v8.3.3). The author continued to express his views on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="1329961" wikidata="Q3987313" url="?curid=1329961" title="The Golden Section">
<text>The Golden Section is a 1983 album by English musician John Foxx. A progression from the sound of &quot;The Garden&quot; (1981), Foxx called &quot;The Golden Section&quot; &quot;a roots check: Beatles, Church music, Psychedelia, The Shadows, The Floyd, The Velvets, Roy Orbison, Kraftwerk, and cheap pre-electro Europop&quot;.
The album was Foxx&#x27;s first work with a producer since his final Ultravox album, &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, in 1978; &quot;The Golden Section&quot; was co-produced by Zeus B. Held, well known in the Krautrock scene of the 1970s. In addition to Foxx&#x27;s wide array of synthesizers, the production made extensive use of vocoder effects and sampling, along with traditional rock guitar.

==Production and style==
Foxx&#x27;s two previous solo albums, &quot;Metamatic&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Garden&quot; (1981), had included a number of compositions written for earlier projects but shelved for one reason or another, such as &quot;He&#x27;s a Liquid&quot; and &quot;Touch and Go&quot;, originally performed live with Ultravox, and &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot;, written during sessions for the album &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;. In contrast &quot;The Golden Section&quot; was almost wholly made up of material written especially for the album in 1983, the exceptions being &quot;Like a Miracle&quot; an earlier version of which was recorded during the &quot;Metamatic&quot; sessions and released on the deluxe edition of that album, and &quot;Endlessly&quot;, an early version of which Foxx had released as a single in mid-1982. Another eight songs he recorded around the same time as &quot;Endlessly&quot;, that were to have formed an album, were scrapped.

The album&#x27;s psychedelic rock flavour was evident on tracks like &quot;Someone&quot; and &quot;Endlessly&quot;. The latter was described by &quot;Trouser Press&quot; as &quot;the album&#x27;s clear standout, a magnificent multi-level pop creation&quot;. &quot;Ghosts on Water&quot; opened with vocal samples from the embers of &quot;Endlessly&quot;, the preceding track on the album. It utilised sitar, backwards cymbals, a shehnai, and a reversed string arrangement at the end, set to an adaptation of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; drum pattern.

&quot;Sitting at the Edge of the World&quot; evoked sounds from &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, whilst &quot;Running Across Thin Ice With Tigers&quot; utilised Beatlesque harmonies and the sound of a tiger&#x27;s roar. The final track, &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot;, shared its title with a 1977 World War III film, a William S. Burroughs short story, and a phrase from &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, though it did not overtly reference any of them.

==Release and aftermath==
&quot;The Golden Section&quot; spent three weeks in the UK charts, peaking at #27. An earlier version of &quot;Endlessly&quot; had been released as a non-album single on 16 July 1982 and did not chart, while an edit of the subsequent album version, released as the first single from the album in June 1983, made #66 in the UK. &quot;Your Dress&quot; was released as a second single in August 1983, reaching #61. The album&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;Like a Miracle&quot;, was released in October 1983, but did not chart. Foxx embarked on a tour to promote the album in late 1983, and live recordings from the Dominion and Lyceum Theatres in London were released in 2002 as part of the double concert CD &quot;The Golden Section Tour + The Omnidelic Exotour&quot;.

==Re-releases==
The Golden Section was re-released on CD with bonus tracks in 2001 and as a deluxe double CD in October 2008, including a sixteen-page booklet containing song lyrics and new artwork. The second CD featured B-sides and eight previously unreleased tracks.

A 40th anniversary clear vinyl edition of the original album, plus a new collection of B-sides, on red vinyl, entitled &quot;Annexe&quot; was released in July 2023.

<text>Roy Prentice Basler (November 19, 1906 – October 25, 1989) was an American historian who rose to prominence in the middle of the 20th century. Basler was most famous for editing the collected works of Abraham Lincoln. He also wrote the introduction to Sam Watkins&#x27; &quot;Co Aytch&quot;.

==Biography==
Basler was born in St. Louis and attended Central Methodist College in Fayette, Missouri, before receiving his PhD in American literature at Duke University. He headed the English departments at Ringling College, Florence State Teachers&#x27; College and Peabody College, and was executive secretary and editor-in-chief of the Abraham Lincoln Association from 1947 to 1952. He joined the staff of the Library of Congress in 1952 and eventually became chief of the manuscript division and held the library&#x27;s chair in American history. He retired in 1974 and moved to Sarasota, Florida, where he died in 1989.

Basler&#x27;s definitive eight volume collection of Lincoln&#x27;s writings was published in 1953 and a supplement was released in 1974. It has been described as &quot;the principal source&quot; and &quot;the most invaluable work of all&quot; for Lincoln studies.

<doc id="1329976" wikidata="Q469314" url="?curid=1329976" title="Samori Ture">
<text>Samori Ture ( – June 2, 1900), also known as Samori Toure, Samory Touré, or Almamy Samore Lafiya Toure, was a Malinke Muslim cleric, military strategist, and founder of the Wassoulou Empire, an Islamic empire that was stretched across present-day north and eastern Guinea, north-eastern Sierra Leone, southern Mali, northern Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and part of southern Burkina Faso.

A deeply religious Muslim of the Maliki school of religious jurisprudence of Sunni Islam, he organized his empire and justified its expansion with Islamic principles. Ture resisted French colonial rule in West Africa from 1882 until his capture in 1898.

He was the great-grandfather of Guinea&#x27;s first president, Ahmed Sékou Touré.

==Early life and career==
Samori Ture was born in Manyambaladugu, the son of Kemo Lanfia Ture, a Dyula weaver and merchant, and Sokhona Camara. The family moved to Sanankoro soon after his birth.

Ture grew up as West Africa was being transformed through growing contacts and trade with the Europeans in commodities, artisan goods and products. European trade made some African trading states rich. The trade in firearms changed traditional West African patterns of warfare and heightened the severity of conflicts, increasing the number of fatalities.

Ture was a troublesome youth, leading a group of local boys who would steal fruit from fields. To put him on a better path, his father bought him some merchandise and sent him off to become a merchant trading kola nuts from the coast for cloth.

In 1853 Sanankoro was raided by the Cissé clan and Samory&#x27;s mother was captured by the prince Sere Brahima, whose older brother Sere Bourlaye was king in Madina. He went to Madina to exchange himself for his mother, and served seven years as a warrior for the Cissé. In their service he learned to handle firearms, the arts of war, and discipline, and converted to Islam. Brave and intelligent, he moved quickly up the ranks. Sere Bourlaye died in 1859. Soon afterwards Sere Brahima, who succeeded him, freed Samory and his mother, and they returned to Sanankoro. According to tradition, he remained &quot;seven years, seven months, seven days&quot; before leaving with his mother.

==Rise to power==
At the time, the Manding region had many war bands that were indistinguishable from bandits. Unable to settle into a peaceful life, Samory joined one of these groups but, with his reputation as a warrior, came into conflict with the incumbent leader. After being whipped for insubordination, he left for another band of which he soon took control. His force would set up outside villages, feeding themselves by extorting passing peasants until the village accepted Samory&#x27;s authority, then they moved on. Their first serious obstacle was the fortified village of Tere, defended by Sere Brema&#x27;s governor in the region. Samory failed both to capture it and to bribe the governor, Dianka, into switching sides. Still, he managed to capture all of the Toron region either by force or diplomacy, building alliances with the powerful Konate family of Gbodou and the leaders of Bissandougou, and taking the village of Faranfina by a ruse. This first expansionist phase, lasting from 1866 to 1873, saw Samory&#x27;s army and influence grow dramatically as members of his mother&#x27;s Camara clan and numerous other volunteers were attracted by his success.

===Battle of Saman-saman===

Samory&#x27;s 1873 capture of Bissandougou represented a declaration of war against Nantenin Famoudou Kourouma, pagan king of Saboudou, who kept his capital at Worokoro. Samori was beaten in their first battle and fell back into the heart of his lands. The night before battle beneath the walls of Bissandougou, Samory went to negotiate with Jamoro Adjigbe Diakite, one of Kourouma&#x27;s most powerful lieutenants. &quot;I believe that you are wrong to fight against your brother Muslim,&quot; he said. &quot;You are Fula and the Fula are Muslim, and I am Ture and the Ture clan are &quot;Manden-Mori&quot; (Muslim of Mande), and one Muslim can&#x27;t fight against his brother Muslim. I brought you a few cola for you to stop this war.&quot; With that, he gave Diakite a large bribe to switch sides.

The next morning, Diakite&#x27;s troops fired on Samory&#x27;s without having loaded bullets into their guns, then turned and helped route Kourouma, who was captured and beheaded. Samory was now Faama of all the land between the Milo, the Sankarani, and Dion rivers.

===Theocratic alliance with Bate ===

After his victory in the battle of Saman-saman, in 1875 the Bate Empire, a theocratic state ruled by the Kaba dynasty of Kankan, sent commissioners to Ture in Bissandougou. Karamo Mori Kaba asked for an alliance against his pagan neighbors, particularly the Condé clan based in Gbérédou. This Samory accepted, sealing the pact with a meeting at Tintioule. As part of this holy alliance, Samory deepened his knowledge of Islam studying with a Mauritanian teacher named Sidiki Cherif.

After clearing the immediate environs of Kankan, Samory and the Kaba launched a successful 10-month siege of Koumban upstream of Kankan on the left bank of the Milo. He won over Gbérédou-Baranama and Jadaba Conde (likely an ancestor of Alpha Condé) of Baro. Rather than facing down the important center of Kouroussa he marched down the banks of the Niger river, conquering or negotiating with various chiefs. The final step was the city of Norassoba, which fell after a 9 month siege and joined the Samory&#x27;s alliance. With this victory, Kouroussa&#x27;s chief Karinkan-Oulen Doumbouya was left with no allies and agreed to submit, with Samory confirming him in his position. He continued on to the capital of Joma (Dioma), Dielibakoro; one of Ture&#x27;s griots was from there, managed to negotiate their peaceful submission. After the treaty of Dielibakoro Samory looked to the gold fields of Buré, annexing Fodekaria (Balimana), then crossing the Milo river and where many of the local chiefs joined the alliance. He subdued the Wassoulou region, which would eventually give its name to his entire empire despite the fact that it was rather peripheral to it. During this series of campaigns he arrested and beheaded Jamoro Adjigbe Diakite for conspiring with the enemy.

To protect his arms caravans, Samory formed a non-aggression pact with Aguibou Tall of Dinguiraye in 1878, then an alliance with the almamy of the Imamate of Futa Jallon Ibrahima Sory Dara in 1879. He sent the remains of the son of El Hadj Oumarou Tall, Seydou, who had died at Norasoba, to Dinguiraye for burial. By this point, he was importing breech-loading rifles via the port of Freetown in the British colony of Sierra Leone. He opened regular contacts with the colonial administration there. By 1878 he was strong enough to proclaim himself &quot;Faama&quot; (military leader) of his Wassoulou Empire.

===War against the Cissé===
While Samory had been conquering in the north of his empire in the years 1875-8, Sere Brema Cissé&#x27;s nephew Morlaye had pushed into the Sankaran region, exploiting Samory&#x27;s relative lack of influence there but attacking some of his allies. The situation now reached a head, and diplomatic outreach came to nothing.

While marching to confront Morlaye, Samory passed through Kankan and asked the Kaba to contribute troops. With the Cissés being fellow Muslims as well as relative by marriage, and feeling sidelined in the alliance, they refused, breaking the accord of Tintioule. Samory left his brother Keme Brema to besiege Kankan while he marched to face the Cissé. He captured Morlaye at Sirinkoro, and then defeated the army sent to rescue him. Soon he had trapped Sere Brema in Worokoro, which soon fell.

Meanwhile, an effort to relieve the siege of Kankan led by the Sakhos of Koundian and the Coulibalis of Keniera who had also revolted against Samory failed and the city was captured. Daye Kaba, who commanded the garrison of the suburb of Karfamoria, managed to escape to Keniera and later to Segou, where he took refuge with Ahmadu Tall. His family was removed from power in Kankan, whose inhabitants were spared a sack but forced to pay a large indemnity in gold. With this great trading center secure, the Wassoulou Empire extended through the territory of present-day Guinea and southern Mali, from what is now Sierra Leone to northern Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

==First battles with the French==
The French began to expand into the heart of West Africa in the late 1870s, pushing eastward from Senegal to ultimately reach the upper reaches of the Nile in what is now Sudan. Their drive south-east to link up with their bases in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire put them directly in conflict with Samori Ture.

After fleeing his native Kankan, Daye Kaba had made contact with the French, who had a garrison at Kita in present-day Mali. The commander Gustave Borgnis-Desbordes sent an envoy to Samori Ture to announce that Kiniéran, where Kaba was sheltering, was now a French protectorate. Unimpressed, Ture sacked the town on February 21, 1882. A French relief column arrived too late, but pursued the Wassoulou army, which turned and fought at Samaya on the 26th. The sofas traditional frontal charges became a slaughter when faced with the latest French weaponry, but Samory quickly pivoted by adopting effective guerilla tactics and hit-and-run cavalry attacks. They harassed the French back to the Niger. This victory won Ture a reputation as the African leader who could stand up to the invading toubab, massively boosting his prestige and recruitment, as well as providing a blueprint for future engagements.

In the aftermath of Samaya, some of the leaders of Bamako began making overtures to Ture. The French, eager to possess this key strategic town on the Niger, rushed a force to establish a fort there on February 1, 1883. Kebe Brema, Samori&#x27;s brother, led a force to Bamako to lure the French out of their defenses. They fought two battles at Woyo Wayanko creek in early April, with Kebe Brema winning the first but eventually being forced to retreat.

In January 1885 Ture sent an embassy to Freetown, offering to put his kingdom under British protection. While the British did not want to risk angering the French, they allowed Ture to buy large numbers of modern repeating rifles.

When an 1885 French expedition under Col. A. V. A. Combes attempted to seize the Buré gold fields by capturing Niagassola, Ture counter-attacked. Dividing his army into three mobile columns, he worked his way around the French lines of communication and quickly forced them to withdraw. Already embroiled in conflict with Mahmadu Lamine and the Toucouleur Empire, the French were compelled to negotiate the Treaty of Kenieba Koura, signed on March 28, 1886. This pact recognized French hegemony over the left bank of the Niger as far upstream as Siguiri, and Samory&#x27;s control of Bure and the Manding region. As part of the agreement, Samory&#x27;s eldest son and heir Djaoulen-Karamo was sent on a diplomatic/fact finding/goodwill mission to France.

==War with Kenedougou==

While Samory had been nominally fighting for Islam since the alliance with the Imamate of Fula Djallon in 1879, in July 1884 he convened a council to officially proclaim Islam as the state religion, crack down on animist practices, and formally take the title of &quot;Almamy&quot;. At roughly the same time, the frontier on the Bagoe river between the Samory&#x27;s lands and the Kenedougou Kingdom was descending into violence as forces from both sides raided into the other, and Tieba Traore&#x27;s army sought to spark a rebellion in the Wassoulou region. With famine and instability widespread, when Samory&#x27;s forces started forcing conversion to Islam and destroying local sacred sites in 1885, the populace rebelled. Rebels massacred sofa garrisons at Siondougou and Fulala. Samory sent Keme Brema to deal with the situation, and he brutally put down the rebellion. By the end of the 1887 dry season, the last holdouts had been starved into submission.

As the Wassoulou region came back under his control, Samory looked to shore up his northern flank. On March 23, 1887, he signed the treaty of Bissandougou with the French. The terms were similar to the treaty signed the year before, although he did accept a French protectorate that Samory saw as unenforceable, as the colonial army was engaged in a campaign to take Segou. With the French now supposed allies, he turned his full force against Kenedougou, beginning a siege of their capital Sikasso in April that would last 15 months.

During this period the army was well equipped with modern firearms and boasted a complex structure of permanent units. It was divided into an infantry wing of sofa and a cavalry wing. In 1887 Samori could field 30,000 to 35,000 infantry and about 3,000 cavalry, in regular squadrons of 50 each. There was also a reserve, one out of every ten men from every village, such that each of the empire&#x27;s 10 provinces could furnish 10,000 men. The elite troops were equipped with the Gras rifle, which local blacksmiths had learned to repair and even build from scratch, but not in the quantities necessary to supply the entire army.

The siege marked the high water mark of Toure&#x27;s power and the beginning of his decline. The Tata of Sikasso was one of the most well-developed defensive systems in West Africa at the time, and Samory had no artillery. His supply lines relied on porters to bring food and ammunition from Bissandougou through still-hostile Bambara territory. Roads became quagmires during the rainy season, and dysentery struck the army, devastating the men and killing Kebe Brema among other important leaders. Meanwhile, the French, far from acting as allies, had built a fort at Siguiri and were blocking all trade with the Sahel or Senegal. As the siege dragged on, anyone living near the road to Bissandougou was forced into service as porters or had their food appropriated by the soldiers. When a rumor began that Samory himself was dead, another massive rebellion broke out. By the end of the 1888 rainy season, he was forced to abandon the siege. His starving, desperate troops again brutally sacked Wassoulou, massacring any rebels they found.

==Fall of Kankan and Bissandougou==
In February 1889 Samory and the French signed yet another treaty, this time at Niako, that pushed colonial control further south. The Almamy was in a relatively weak position after the debacle at Sikasso, and the French were still focused on Segou. They soon broke some of the verbal promises that had been made at Niako relative to the return of fugitives and rebels. In another blow, the British had stopped selling breechloading guns in accordance with the Brussels Conference Act of 1890.

On March 10, 1891, a French force under Colonel Louis Archinard set out from Nyamina for a surprise attack on Kankan, rendering all the previous treaties moot. He expected to subdue Samory in a few weeks with a lightning campaign. Knowing his fortifications could not stop French artillery, Ture began a war of manoeuvre and scorched earth. Despite victories against isolated French columns (for example at Dabadugu in September 1891), he failed to push the French from the core of his kingdom. Archinard had little trouble capturing Kankan on April 11 and then a deserted Bissandougou, but Ture had left little worth taking. They set up a garrison in Kankan, where they reinstalled Daye Kaba as a puppet ruler.
Samori organized a great assembly in August 1891 in Missamaghana, inviting his son in law Mangbe-Amadou Ture of the Kabadougou Kingdom, also called Kabassarana. The empire was put on a war footing, collecting metal to melt into bullets, stocking granaries, recruiting soldiers etc. While the best-armed troops resisted the French using French-made repeater rifles, those armed with the bolt-action chassepot conquered new territory to the east to use as a strategic reserve, and men with flintlocks served as the home guard or internal security. With this system, Samory could fall back into territory already conquered and organized, leaving no food for the French, for the next seven years.

Archinard&#x27;s replacement Col. Pierre Humbert arrived in Kankan in January 1892 and led a small, well-supplied force of picked men on an attack on Bissandougou. The sofas fought defensive battles at the Soumbe and Diamanko creeks the 11th and 12th, taking heavy casualties but doing serious damage to the French and nearly capturing the enemy artillery, but could not save the once-again abandoned city. The French kept chasing Samori&#x27;s army south, facing ambushes, guerilla warfare, and scorched earth the whole way, installing garrisons at Bissandougou and Kerouane. At another council at Frankonedou on May 9, 1892, Samory and his allies decided to rebase the empire in Kabadougou, devastating each area before evacuating it to delay French pursuit.

During the first months of 1893 the French, although unable to corner Ture armies in Guinea, did manage to capture Faranah and block resupply routes to Liberia and Sierra Leone, Wassoulou&#x27;s primary source of modern weaponry. This left Samory reliant on a longer route through the Gold Coast. The Wassoulou vassals in Kissidougou and the rest of the western- and southernmost parts of the empire surrendered, and the French looked to rebuild profitable colonies in the wartorn lands rather than push further. Samory Ture&#x27;s empire in the Manding region was now gone, but he still commanded some 12000 infantry, 2000 cavalry, and had a moving retinue of some 120,000 people as he pushed east.

==The Second Wassoulou Empire==
===Capture of Kong===
Encouraged by Babemba Traore, who had succeeded his brother Tieba as &quot;faama&quot; of Kenedougou, the Bambara country again rose in revolt in 1894, blocking Samory&#x27;s access to Sahelian horses. He moved his base out of Kabadougou toward the Bandama and Comoe River to Dabakala in February 1895.

His objective, and the key to the whole region, was the ancient Dyula trading city of Kong. The city had nominally accepted French protection during Louis-Gustave Binger&#x27;s visit in 1892, and the colonial leaders sought to formalize this relationship by putting together a column led by Col. Monteil in August 1894. The force did not leave Grand Bassam, however, until February 1895, and its arrival sparked a popular resistance movement. Monteil stumbled onto the sofas on March 2, to the surprise of both sides; in a battle on the 14th, the French were forced to retreat and abandon Kong, which pledged fealty to Samory in April. He would enjoy nearly two years to consolidate his new empire without significant French intervention.

===Consolidating control===
Samory&#x27;s sofa forces has been depleted by war and the wholesale migration east. His defeat of Babemba Traore at Kaloua in September 1894, however, boosted his prestige among the Senufo people, many of whom joined the army. He also tried to build an anti-European alliance with the Ashanti Empire, but this attempt failed when they were defeated by the British.

Ture accorded the city of Kong numerous privileges, but the local Dyula merchants&#x27; commerce with the coast, dominated by the French, had slowed since their absorption into the Wassoulou empire. When Samory, looking to push further east into the Gold Coast to secure new sources of guns, retreated rather than fight a French force, they sought to take advantage of his weakness by intercepting arms caravans and opening channels to invite the French back. When the discontent eventually broke into open revolt, Samory destroyed the city on May 23, 1897.

The force that the sofas had encountered was part of France&#x27;s efforts to control Bouna while keeping Samory and the British apart. Capt. came south from the Niger bend to attempt to negotiate another protectorate but was rebuffed, as Ture wanted only to live apart from the French. In April 1897, British Governor William Edward Maxwell of the Gold Coast tried to intimidate Saranken Mori, Samory&#x27;s son and the commander in the region, into abandoning Bouna. When this failed, a force of the Southern Nigeria Regiment under Henderson marched on the town but were defeated at Dokita, then later routed and Henderson was captured at Wa.

Knowing this setback would prompt an aggressive British response, the French again sent Braulot, at the head of an armed column, to try to acquire Bouna by negotiation. Saranken Mori initially accepted. But when Braulot arrived at Bouna, he was killed and his column destroyed outside the city on August 20, 1897, restarting the war between the French and Samory Ture.

===Last stand===

The fall of the Kenedougou capital of Sikasso on May 1, 1898, permitted French colonial forces to launch a concentrated assault against Ture. He soon was forced to migrate once again, this time towards Liberia. Hoping to live off the land while marching, a combination of the unfamiliar mountainous territory of western Ivory Coast, hostile locals, and colonial attacks turned the campaign into a disaster. Thousands died of starvation. Using information from sofa deserters, the French captain Henri Gouraud surprised Ture&#x27;s forces at Guelemou on September 29, 1898, and captured the Almamy without a fight.

==Exile and death==
Samori Ture was brought to Kayes, and on December 22, 1898, was condemned to exile, despite his wish to return to southern Guinea. His wife Saranken Konate, who had often ruled as regent during his absences from Bissandougou, refused to accompany him. Emotionally devastated, he was taken to Saint-Louis, Senegal on January 4, 1899. He attempted suicide the night before he was scheduled to be deported to Gabon but survived and finally embarked on February 5.

The prison camp where Samori Ture spent his last years, the small island of Missanga in the middle of the Ogooué River near Ndjolé, was known as the &#x27;dry guillotine&#x27; due to the death rate among prisoners. He died there of pneumonia on June 2, 1900, at 4:45 pm.

==Legacy==

In the first decades of colonial domination in southern Mali and northeastern Guinea, the French framed their conquest as having delivered the locals from the violence and insecurity of the Samory years, and therefore that the communities owed their lives and allegiance to them. During the interwar period, however, African intellectuals began to rehabilitate Ture&#x27;s memory. He became a hero and rallying cry for anti-colonial parties in Guinea and Mali, but was also used by their opponents. Since independence, Samori Ture has been generally remembered as a hero and martyr of African resistance to European colonialism. In some communities in southern Mali that suffered brutal repression under his rule, however, he is remembered as a tyrant.

Samory&#x27;s great-grandson, Ahmed Sékou Touré, was elected as the first President of Guinea after it became independent. Today, his tomb is at the Camayanne Mausoleum, within the gardens of Conakry Grand Mosque.

==In popular culture==
*Massa Makan Diabaté&#x27;s play &quot;Une hyène à jeun&quot; (A Hyena with an Empty Stomach, 1988) dramatizes Samori Ture&#x27;s signing of the 1886 Treaty of Kéniéba-Koura, which granted the left bank of the Niger to France.
*Guinean band Bembeya Jazz National commemorated Ture in their 1969 release &quot;Regard sur le passé.&quot; The album draws upon Manding Djeli traditions and consists of two recordings that recount Ture&#x27;s anti-colonial resistance and nation-building.
*Author Ta-Nehisi Coates references Ture in his book &quot;Between the World and Me&quot; when explaining to his son where his name Samori came from.
*Ivorien reggae superstar Alpha Blondy eulogises Ture in his hit song &quot;Bory Samory&quot; from the Album &quot;Cocody Rock&quot;.
*Italian band Classica Orchestra Afrobeat directed by Marco Zanotti produced Regard sur le Passe in 2014, which is a 3 act musical suite which tells the epic story of Ture with two on-stage griots – Sekouba Bambino and Baba Sissoko.

<text>WYJB (95.5 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Albany, New York, and serving the Capital District, including Schenectady and Troy. The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and broadcasts an adult contemporary radio format, switching to Christmas music for much of November and December. On weekday evenings, WYJB carries the nationally syndicated call-in and dedications show hosted by Delilah. The station&#x27;s radio studios and offices are on Johnson Road in Latham.

WYJB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 12,000 watts. It transmits from the Helderberg Mountains antenna farm off Pinnacle Road in Voorheesville.

==History==
===Beautiful music===
The 95.5 frequency was originally allocated to the unbuilt WXKW-FM in 1950. It signed on in 1966 as WROW-FM, sister station to Capital Cities Communications flagship outlet WROW (590 AM). Initially, it simulcast the AM&#x27;s beautiful music programming. WROW-AM-FM played quarter hour sweeps of mostly instrumental cover versions of popular songs, with some Broadway and Hollywood show tunes.

Around 1967, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required FM stations in larger cities to originate their own programming. WROW-FM began &quot;shadowcasting&quot; its easy listening sound. The AM and FM station continued to run the same commercials and aired similar music, but not exactly at the same time. Announcers would prerecord weather and news briefs for the FM, while reading them live on the AM station. Technically, they were separately programmed, although most listeners did not realize it. This arrangement remained until after Capital Cities sold the WROW stations in 1983, at which point the FM became the primary station and the AM station became the simulcast.

===Soft AC===
By the late 1980s, easy listening stations began attracting older listeners, so WROW-FM began to modernize its sound with more soft vocals and fewer instrumentals. WROW-FM evolved to a soft adult contemporary format as &quot;EZ95.5&quot; in early 1991, with easy listening moving solely to the AM side. In 1993, the WROW stations were sold to Albany Broadcasting (forerunner to today&#x27;s Pamal Broadcasting), at which point an overhaul of the station took place.

On January 3, 1994, &quot;EZ95.5&quot; relaunched with a more mainstream AC sound as &quot;The New B95.5&quot; with the WYJB call sign coming into effect several days prior. Within five years of the launch, B95.5 forced the weaker competition out of the AC format, including 100.9 WKLI and many of its future rival stations, such as 94.5 FM and Buzz 105.7.

===Personalities===
In 2001, Delilah was added to the station in the evenings after WKLI (then on 94.5 FM) flipped to classic rock; and continued to develop a slight hot AC lean. Five years later, the long-time morning show &quot;Chuck and Kelly&quot; moved to competitor WBZZ (originally on 104.5, later on 105.7), and Ric Mitchell and Laura Daniels (formerly of WFLY) were named Chuck and Kelly&#x27;s replacements. In 2010, Ric Mitchell left WYJB, with Chuck Taylor returning to the morning show shortly after. When WBZZ dumped adult contemporary that year, it left WYJB and rimshot competitor WQAR (now WJKE) as Albany&#x27;s only adult contemporary radio stations.

On November 9, 2011, the station switched to Christmas music for the first time, in response to the flip of oldies station 98.3 WTRY-FM to all-Christmas the same day. Shortly after Christmas, the station tweaked into more of a hot AC sound with new slogans and jingles. However, the station still reports as adult contemporary on Nielsen BDS and Mediabase charts.

<text>Jacopo Mazzoni (Latinized as Jacobus Mazzonius, 27 November 1548 – 10 April 1598) was an Italian philosopher, a professor in Pisa, and friend of Galileo Galilei. His first name is sometimes reported as Giacomo.

==Biography==
Giacopo (Jacopo) Mazzoni was born in Cesena, the Papal States (modern day Italy) on 27 November 1548. Educated in Bologna in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, rhetoric, and poetics, Mazzoni later attended the University of Padua in 1563 where he studied philosophy and jurisprudence.

One of the most eminent savants of the period, Mazzoni was reported to have an excellent memory, which made him adept at recalling passages from Dante, Lucretius, Virgil, and others in his regular debates with prominent public figures. It also allowed him to excel at memory contests, which he routinely won. He is said to have defeated the Admirable Crichton three times in dialectic.

Later in life, Mazzoni would teach at universities in Rome, Paris, and Cesena, and was partly responsible for the establishment of the Della Crusca Academy.

He was an authority on ancient languages and philology, and gave a great impetus to the scientific study of the Italian language. Mazzoni died in Ferrara, Italy, in 1598.

==Major works==
Though Mazzoni considered himself primarily a philosopher, his major work of philosophy – an attempt to reconcile the theories of Plato and Aristotle called (&quot;On the Three Ways of Man&#x27;s Life: the Active, the Contemplative, and the Religious&quot;, published in 1576) – is not widely read. Mazzoni is most known for his work on literary criticism, particularly his defenses of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, (&quot;The Discourse in Defense of the Comedy of the Divine Poet Dante&quot;), published in 1572 and a second effort, (&quot;On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante&quot;), which was not published until 1688.

Mazzoni was originally asked to write the defense by a noble friend who was distressed at criticism being leveled at the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Ridolfo Castravilla. Mazzoni&#x27;s initial volume on the subject (&quot;The Discourse in Defense&quot;...), which he claims was written in only 20 days, attracted criticism for its sometimes vague reasoning and its tendency, at times, to simply contradict, rather than refute, Dante&#x27;s detractors.

In response to criticisms that contemporaries such as Belisario Bulgarini leveled against his first effort, Mazzoni wrote the more extensive and more sophisticated &quot;On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante&quot;. In this work, before directly addressing Dante&#x27;s work, Mazzoni develops his theory of poetics, in which, drawing heavily from Plato and Aristotle, he discusses mimesis, the role of poetry, and the definition of poetry versus poetics (see Theory section, below). Though no complete English translation of Mazzoni&#x27;s text exists, excerpts from the Introduction and Summary have appeared in some anthologies, as well as in a partial translation by Robert L. Montgomery.

==Theory==
One of Mazzoni&#x27;s more significant contributions to criticism is his discussion of mimesis in poetry. Mazzoni departs from his predecessors in that he conceives of poetic imitation not as the recreation of an actual object, but as the recreation of an ideal. This idea, which has been compared to Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s simulacrum, Mazzoni calls the &quot;idol&quot; – a concept constructed by human artifice to which poetic imitations are compared in order to determine their believability. Mazzoni discusses believability or credibility, rather than truth – he defines poetry as a sophistic activity, the purpose of which is not to recreate truth, but rather to mimic that which will have the proper effect on the audience. As Mazzoni says, &quot;if it should happen that two things should appear before the poet, one of them false but credible and the other true but incredible or at least not very credible, then the poet must leave the true and follow the credible.&quot;

Mazzoni resurrects the ancient tradition of linking poetry to rhetoric, which also has the credible, rather than the true, as its object. He also gives great importance to poetry&#x27;s effect on the audience as a determinant of quality. Although he admits that much of the exercise of poetry involves attempting faithful imitation (albeit of human constructs or categories, not ones that are necessarily true), success in poetry for him is ultimately determined by persuasion, not truth and objectivity. For him, successful poetry is something that occurs in and of the audience, not outside and independent of it. For Mazzoni, even &quot;poetry&quot; is a meaningless category – it is our classifications that constitute criticism, not our ability to form a relationship with some reified thing called &quot;The Poem&quot;.

Like Plato, Mazzoni was very concerned with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to &quot;move the reader to pleasure and delight in the perception of the believable images.&quot; Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls &quot;civil faculty.&quot; In part, this has to do with the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.

Mazzoni&#x27;s work is characterized by his methodical attempts to draw distinctions between similar phenomena. In proceeding along this course, he makes some compelling definitions and distinctions, such as that between poetry and poetics, the former being concerned with the formation of poetry (considerations for rhyme or meter for example) and the latter with a poem&#x27;s relationship to the &quot;civil faculty.&quot;

The distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, is also important in Mazzoni&#x27;s work. &quot;Icastic imitation&quot; refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or the creation of a character based on a real person is icastic imitation. &quot;Phantastic imitation&quot; is the imitation of something completely the artist&#x27;s imagination. This distinction would play an important role in Mazzoni&#x27;s &quot;On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante&quot;, in which he would argue that the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something real. This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed Dante&#x27;s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the &quot;Comedy&quot; was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni&#x27;s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made persuasive by the use of craft or art.

==Influences==
Some of Mazzoni&#x27;s influences are clear, such as Plato and Aristotle. Mazzoni regularly makes direct reference to their works and draws some of his ideas directly from theories that they established (such as Plato&#x27;s icastic and phantastic imitation). The influence of other thinkers has also been identified in Mazzoni&#x27;s work, including neo-platonists such as Proclus, and Greek sophists such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Aulus Gellius (the latter two particularly in Mazzoni&#x27;s discussion on the impact of the character of the poet on the nature of the poem).

==Influence and criticism==
Mazzoni influenced many theorists ranging from the Romantic era right up to the 21st century. In &quot;emphasizing poetry&#x27;s relationship to images and games,&quot; for example, Mazzoni informs romantic writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Friedrich von Schiller (Leitch, 301). His influence can also be seen in modern efforts to define the difference between poetic language and other types. Mazzoni has also been subject to criticism, for example, he has been called contradictory in trying to assign both pleasure and social utility to poetry at the same time, while others question his use of the distinction between icastic and phantastic mimesis (Leitch, 301).

<doc id="1330003" wikidata="Q117081" url="?curid=1330003" title="King Levinsky">
<text>King Levinsky (10 September 1910 – 30 September 1991), also known as Kingfish Levinsky, was an American heavyweight boxer who fought during the 1930s. He was born as Harris Kraków and was a member of the Kraków fish-selling family of Maxwell Street, in Chicago&#x27;s old Jewish ghetto.

==Professional career==

===Notable opposition===
Levinsky was a rated heavyweight whose biggest wins came against ex-heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey on a 10-round decision, and ex-lightheavyweight champion Tommy Loughran, also on a decision. He was defeated twice by Primo Carnera, and also lost to Max Baer. Although he never fought for the title, Levinsky faced all of the top fighters of his era.

Levinsky is best remembered for &quot;freezing&quot; in his fight with Joe Louis, who knocked him out in the first round. On February 18, 1931, Levinsky also fought a 4-round exhibition with Jack Dempsey. Dempsey had embarked on a tour of exhibition bouts and was contemplating a comeback. The Levinsky fight convinced him that he was through as a fighter.

On November 19, 1935 Levinsky lost to professional wrestler Ray Steele in a boxer versus wrestler match in St. Louis, Missouri.

===Marketability===
A May 1932 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; article stated: &quot;If you defined the efficiency of a prize-fighter by his ability in the ring, Harry Krakow (&#x27;Kingfish Levinsky&#x27;) would not rate better than tenth among U. S. heavyweights. Last year he had 15 fights, won only eight. If you defined efficiency as a fighter&#x27;s ability to earn money at his trade, Kingfish Levinsky might rank as best fighter in the U. S. In the last 15 months, gates at his fights with Slattery, Griffiths, Carnera, Paulino and an exhibition bout against Jack Dempsey have amounted to $254,124.68. He may this year earn more than Schmeling, Sharkey, Dempsey, Carnera or Schaaf. Kingfish Levinsky&#x27;s earning power is due partly to an engaging slapstick manner in the ring, an engaging entourage... It is due partly to the fact that most of Levinsky&#x27;s fights have been in Chicago, where everyone knows that he grew up on the West Side and entered the fish-peddling business with a pushcart on Maxwell Street.&quot;

For a portion of his career, Levinsky was managed by his sister Lena (Kraków) Levy. Known as &quot;Leapin Lena&quot;, she was a colorful character who swore like a sailor, and rooted loudly for her brother during his bouts. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, in its February 1939 issue, included an article profiling his new career as a professional wrestler.

===Life after boxing===
Levinsky served in the US Army during World War II. In his later years he worked as a tie salesman in Miami Beach, Florida.
He was married to fan dancer Roxana Sand for just over a month in 1934. In 1935, Levinsky became a professional wrestler as Kingfish Levinsky working in the States and Canada until retiring in 1946.

<doc id="1330009" wikidata="Q3797144" url="?curid=1330009" title="In Mysterious Ways">
<text>In Mysterious Ways is a 1985 album by John Foxx, the follow-up to his album &quot;The Golden Section&quot;, released two years previously. It features some of the highly romantic style similar to 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Garden&quot; album. Largely missing from this recording are many of the styles Foxx was known for (such as glam inspired art rock, punk and minimal synthpop) in favor of a more soulful, contemporary pop sound.

The lyrics are of discovery and rediscovery and there is much vibrato-laden organ-playing on this record. There are acoustic guitars, mid-1980s home studio-sounding rhythm machines, live drums and glimpses of &quot;Cathedral Oceans&quot; -style ambient music in places—particularly in the &quot;Enter the Angel&quot; reprise. Although &quot;Cathedral Oceans&quot; was not released until 12 years later, Foxx has stated he started working on the material as early as 1983.

The cover art is in the collage style he had been presenting to his public since the early Ultravox! days. An expanded edition was released in 2001 and a 2CD &#x27;deluxe edition&#x27; in 2008. Both of these CD reissues have different track running-orders from the original releases.

<doc id="1330011" wikidata="Q5472045" url="?curid=1330011" title="Fort Slocum">
<text>Fort Slocum, New York was a US military post which occupied Davids Island in the western end of Long Island Sound in the city of New Rochelle, New York, from 1867 to 1965. The fort was named for Major General Henry W. Slocum, a Union corps commander in the American Civil War.

==History==
===Civil War===
Military use of the island dates from 1861, when the 3rd Regiment (63rd New York Infantry) of the Irish Brigade established Camp Carrigan. In 1862, Davids Island was leased by the U.S. Government. This marked the first use of Davids Island by the Regular Army. At that time, De Camp General Hospital (named for Dr. Samuel G. I. de Camp) was established to serve thousands of wounded individuals from the battlefields of the American Civil War. By late 1862, De Camp was the Army&#x27;s largest general hospital, housing more than 2,100 patients.

Originally, De Camp General Hospital treated only Union soldiers, but following the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, the War Department opened it to care for hundreds of wounded Confederate soldiers. Even though a prison camp had been established on Hart Island in 1865, Davids Island soon held more than 2,500 Confederate prisoners of war. Most had recovered by October, and they were moved to prisoner-of-war camps elsewhere. A ferry connection was established during the war from Neptune Island, under the control of Simeon Leland.

===Post Civil War===
At the end of the war, Congress authorized the island&#x27;s purchase for military purposes and it was conveyed to the United States as the Davids Island Military Reservation in 1867. From this date, the Federal government operated its own ferry to and from Neptune Island. In July 1878 Davids Island was made a principal depot of the U.S. Army General Recruiting Service, taking over this assignment from Governors Island. This marked the beginning of the installation&#x27;s longstanding mission as a recruitment and training center.

===Late 19th century through 1916===
As the post on Davids Island grew, in the 1880s the Army invested in new brick construction of more than 20 new buildings, including officers&#x27; quarters, enlisted men&#x27;s barracks, mess halls, hospital buildings, and support facilities. It was later converted to a coastal artillery defense post and was eventually given the name Fort Slocum after Major General Henry W. Slocum, U.S. Volunteers in 1896. Construction of fortifications on the island resulted from the recommendations of the Endicott Board of Fortifications, an 1885 study of America&#x27;s coastal defenses. The study called for better protection of ports such as New York Harbor, and Davids Island became part of its system of defenses.

Between 1891 and 1904, artillery batteries were erected at three places on the eastern half of the island: Battery Practice near the southeastern shoreline, with 1870s-era weapons for training personnel for older forts, the state-of-the-art Abbot Quad heavy mortar batteries, Haskin and Overton, mounting a total of 16 breech-loading 12-inch mortars, at the southeast end of the island; and two adjoining medium-range breech-loading rifled gun batteries, Fraser and Kinney, on the northeastern shore.

Battery Practice had at least one 15-inch smoothbore Rodman gun and two 8-inch converted rifles, all muzzle-loading and typical of weapons emplaced in the 1870s. It was disestablished in 1899, although the 15-inch gun remains on the island. Battery Kinney had two 6-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts, and Battery Fraser had two 5-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts. (Despite the presence of mis-captioned postcards, including those in the New Rochelle Public Library, there were never large-caliber breech-loading disappearing guns placed at Davids Island.)

Battery Haskin was named for Joseph A. Haskin, a general who served in the Mexican War and Civil War, whose son, Major William L. Haskin, commanded Davids Island 1894–1896. Battery Overton was named for Captain Clough Overton, a cavalry officer in the Spanish–American War. Battery Kinney was named for Joseph Kinney, an officer killed in the War of 1812, and Battery Fraser was named for Upton S. Fraser, an officer killed by the Seminoles in 1835.

With improved dreadnought battleships and the construction of the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound at the beginning of the 20th century, these batteries became obsolete, and Ft. Slocum was removed in 1907 from the Artillery District of New York (Coast Defenses of Eastern New York from 1913), leaving Fort Totten and Fort Schuyler in that role until 1935. However, Fort Slocum retained all its guns until World War I. At the start of the 20th Century Davids Island became the East Coast assembly point for units assigned to America&#x27;s new overseas territories.

===World War I===
After the American entry into World War I Fort Slocum became one of the busiest recruit training stations in the country, processing 100,000 soldiers per year and serving as the recruit examination station for soldiers from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the New England states. Between 1917 and 1919, over 140,000 recruits passed through the post. Recruit Week in December 1917 brought so many recruits to Fort Slocum that an overflow had to be housed in New Rochelle.

Fort Slocum&#x27;s guns were dismounted and transferred to other uses beginning in 1917. Battery Kinney&#x27;s 6-inch guns were moved to Fort Tilden. Battery Fraser&#x27;s 5-inch guns were dismounted, probably for potential service on field carriages on the Western Front. Records do not indicate if these guns were sent to France. In 1919 Fort Slocum was totally disarmed. Its 16 mortars were removed and possibly became railway artillery.

===Between the wars===
In 1922 there was a general military drawdown, and closure of Fort Slocum was proposed. It remained open with varying roles. It housed at least one US Olympic Team, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp, and the Army cooks&#x27; and bakers&#x27; school. The 1884 water tower was replaced in 1929, and a sewage system was installed. In the 1930s most of the coast defense batteries were demolished to make room for three new barracks, the Trivium.

===World War II===
On 16 May 1941, as war raged in Europe, Fort Slocum became part of the New York Port of Embarkation, becoming a staging area for troops moving overseas. Fort Slocum also trained cadre to set up other staging areas in Greater New York, such as Camp Kilmer and Camp Shanks in 1941 and 1942. Fort Slocum hosted the Atlantic Coast Transportation Officers&#x27; Training School, acquainting former civilians from the transportation industries with the Army. The fort was a key element of the Army&#x27;s Transportation Corps, so named in mid-1942, whose mission was moving huge numbers of men and amounts of materiel overseas.

By early 1944 the need to ship troops to Europe had lessened, and a policy of rotating troops in the US who hadn&#x27;t seen action to overseas battlefields and the reverse was instituted. Battle-hardened soldiers returning from Europe were put through a &quot;Provisional Training Center&quot; at Fort Slocum to re-acquaint them with the stateside Army, with its surplus of proper military appearance, courtesy, and discipline, along with its deficit of actually shooting Germans. In May 1944 Private Willie Lee Duckworth of Sandersville, Georgia devised the famous &quot;Sound off, one, two&quot; military cadence while attending one of these classes. In November 1944, as the transportation school wound down, Fort Slocum took on a mission of rehabilitating soldiers who had been court-martialed in Europe and sent home.

===Late 1940s===
Following World War II, Fort Slocum was briefly considered as a nuclear research center; what became Brookhaven National Laboratory was chosen instead. From 1946 to 1949, Fort Slocum housed Headquarters First Air Force. It was renamed Slocum Air Force Base in June 1949; this only lasted for a year before being turned back into an Army post in June 1950. From 1955 to 1960, Fort Slocum housed part of Nike Ajax air-defense missile battery NY-15. The missiles were stored on launch rails and in underground bunkers on nearby Hart Island, with the radar and control base situated on Davids&#x27; Island. In July 1960, after only five years of operation, Nike Battery NY-15 was closed.

===1950-1965===
From 1951 to 1962, Fort Slocum was the home of the U.S. Army Chaplain School. From 1951 to 1954, Fort Slocum was home to the joint services Armed Forces Information School. From 1954, this was truncated to the Army Information School; from 1964, this was again reorganized into the joint services Defense Information School, which was later transferred to Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, and then to its current home at Fort Meade, Maryland. Over the course of this time, troops from the various services, officers and enlisted, male and female, American and allied, were trained in applied journalism, oral communication, radio/TV broadcasting, public and world affairs, and photography. In 1965, the information school was moved to Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana when Fort Slocum was deactivated.

===After closure===
Fort Slocum was deactivated on November 30, 1965. During the decades that followed, the facilities of the former Army post were neglected and deteriorated severely and continued to occupy Davids Island into the beginning of the 21st century. The ruins were among the factors complicating redevelopment of the island. Beginning in 2004, however, Congress appropriated funds to remove the ruins through a Defense Department program that assists communities in reusing former defense facilities. During the summer of 2008, the city of New Rochelle demolished all remaining structures on the island, including the iconic water tower on the northern end of the island, with plans to turn the island into a park.

===&quot;Sound off, one, two&quot;===

The famous &quot;Sound off, one, two&quot; military cadence was invented at Fort Slocum in May 1944, attributed to Private Willie Lee Duckworth of Sandersville, Georgia. 
===Other uses of the name===
Fort Slocum was also the name of a Civil War fort in the Defenses of Washington, D.C., although it was named for a different Slocum (Colonel John S. Slocum of Rhode Island, killed at the First Battle of Bull Run). The Library of Congress web site contains two photographs titled &quot;Officers, 4th U.S. Colored Infantry, Fort Slocum, April, 1865&quot;. Since that regiment was never stationed north of Baltimore, Maryland, it is likely that the Fort Slocum referred to was the one in Washington, D.C.

<text>Guido Mazzoni (1859–1943) was an Italian poet.

He was born in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and educated in Pisa and Bologna. In 1887 he became professor of Italian at Padua, and in 1894 at Florence, where he remained until retirement in 1934. He was much influenced by Carducci, and became prominent both as prolific and well-read critic and as a poet of individual distinction.

In 1910, he was elected a senator. In 1915, his son Carlo was taken prisoner by Austrian forces; the father volunteered for combat duty in exchange, and participated in combat along the Isonzo River.

His chief volumes of verse are &quot;Versi&quot; (1880), &quot;Nuove poesie&quot; (1886), &quot;Poesie&quot; (1891), &quot;Voci della vita&quot; (1893).

<text>SJD, or Sean James Donnelly, is a musician from Auckland, New Zealand. His music is a mix of pop-rock, soul, and electronic music. The name SJD also refers to Donnelly&#x27;s touring band when not performing solo.

==History==
Donnelly has cited influences including Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Gary Numan, the Human League and Soft Cell. SJD&#x27;s debut album &quot;3&quot; was initially self-released on Swarf Records as 120 CD-Rs in 1999 before being picked up by Flavour Distribution. After contributing a track to the &quot;Sideways&quot; compilation and playing alongside Phase 5 he then signed to the Round Trip Mars label. Second album &quot;Lost Soul Music&quot; was released in 2001. &quot;Southern Lights&quot; was released 2004 with assistance from government arts funding agency Creative New Zealand, yielding the single &quot;Superman You&#x27;re Crying&quot; which met with some popular success in New Zealand and huge critical acclaim. Sean Donnelly and Angus McNaughton shared the 2005 New Zealand Music Awards Tuis for Best Producer and Best Engineer for their work on &quot;Southern Lights&quot;. &quot;Songs from a Dictaphone&quot; was released in July 2007 and followed by &quot;Dayglo Spectres&quot;, which is a collaborative effort with guitarist and fellow Round Trip Mars artist James Duncan (also in Dimmer), and was released in Oct 2008. His album &quot;Elastic Wasteland&quot; is entirely written, played, produced and mixed by Sean alone and was released on 16 November 2012.

SJD has collaborated with several other New Zealand musicians, including contributions to Dimmer&#x27;s successful album &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hear the Music&quot;.

With Don McGlashan and Edmund McWilliams, he co-produced Don McGlashan&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Warm Hand&quot; and wrote &quot;I Will Not Let You Down&quot;, which is on the album.

Sean Donnelly formed The Bellbirds in 2009 with Sandy Mill, Victoria Kelly and Don McGlashan. He writes most of their songs.

In 2011, he was part of Neil Finn&#x27;s Pajama Club project.

In 2012 he produced an all-star cover version of Chris Knox&#x27;s &quot;Not Given Lightly&quot; for the New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation.

In 2013 SJD won the Taite Music Prize for his album &quot;Elastic Wasteland&quot;. In 2015, he released the album &quot;Saint John Divine&quot;.

Donnelly was awarded the Mozart Fellowship at the University of Otago in 2022 and 2023.

==Quotes==
&quot;There&#x27;s a disadvantage in terms of connecting to an audience because New Zealand is a small country and you can&#x27;t really survive off a cult audience. But having said that, the cultural isolation and the fact that you probably aren&#x27;t really going to make it add an imperative to achieve on a more aesthetic level, as opposed to a more financial level. If you don&#x27;t think you can succeed any other way, you&#x27;ve got to try and be true to your heart.&quot; -- &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s pulsing electronica&quot;, New Zealand Herald (2001-06-08)

<doc id="1330059" wikidata="Q6781001" url="?curid=1330059" title="Mary Young Pickersgill">
<text>Mary Pickersgill (born Mary Young; February 12, 1776 – October 4, 1857) was the maker of the Star-Spangled Banner hoisted over Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. The daughter of another noted flag maker, Rebecca Young, Pickersgill learned her craft from her mother, and in 1813 she was commissioned by Major George Armistead to make a flag for Baltimore&#x27;s Fort McHenry that was so large that the British would have no difficulty seeing it from a great distance. The flag was installed in August 1813 and, during the Battle of Baltimore a year later, Francis Scott Key could see the flag while negotiating a prisoner exchange aboard a British vessel and was inspired to pen the words that became the United States National Anthem in 1931.

Pickersgill, widowed at age 29, became successful enough in her flag-making business that in 1820 she was able to buy the house that she had been renting in Baltimore, and later she became active in addressing social issues, such as housing and employment for disadvantaged women. From 1828 to 1851, she was president of the Impartial Female Humane Society which had been founded in 1802 and incorporated in 1811, and helped impoverished families with school vouchers for children and employment for women. Under Pickersgill&#x27;s leadership, this organization built a home for aged women and later added an Aged Men&#x27;s Home which was built adjacent to it. These, more than a century later, evolved into the Pickersgill Retirement Community of Towson, Maryland which opened in 1959.

Pickersgill died in 1857 and was buried in the Loudon Park Cemetery in southwest Baltimore, where her daughter erected a monument for her, and where some civic-minded organizations later erected a bronze plaque. The house where Pickersgill lived for 50 years, at the northwest corner of Albemarle and East Pratt Streets in downtown Baltimore, became known as the Star-Spangled Banner Flag House in 1927. The house was saved through the efforts of many preservation-minded citizens who were motivated by the Centennial Celebrations of 1914.

==Early life==

Mary Young was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 12, 1776, the youngest of the six children of William Young and Rebecca Flower. Her mother, who became widowed when Mary was two years old, had a flag shop on Walnut Street in Philadelphia where she made ensigns, garrison flags and &quot;Continental Colors&quot; for the Continental Army. Her 1781 advertisement in the &quot;Pennsylvania Packet&quot; read, &quot;All kinds of colours, for the Army and Navy, made and sold on the most reasonable Terms, By Rebecca Young.&quot; Young moved her family to Baltimore, Maryland when Mary was a child, and it was from her mother that Mary learned the craft of flag making.

On October 2, 1795, at age 19, Mary married John Pickersgill, a merchant, and moved back to Philadelphia with him. Of Mary&#x27;s four children, only one survived childhood, a daughter named Caroline. Mary&#x27;s husband traveled to London to work for the United States Government in the British Claims Office, but died in London on June 14, 1805, leaving Mary widowed at age 29. In 1807 Mary moved back to Baltimore with her daughter Caroline and 67-year-old mother Rebecca.

The small family rented a house at 44 Queen Street (later 844 East Pratt Street, which became the Star Spangled Banner Flag House and 1812 Museum), where Pickersgill took in boarders and opened a flag-making business, selling &quot;silk standards, cavalry and division colours of every description.&quot; Her customers included the United States Army, United States Navy, and visiting merchant ships.

==The Fort McHenry flag==

In 1813 the United States was at war with Great Britain, and Baltimore was preparing for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the infantry and artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. In a letter to the head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, &quot;We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. That is to say, we are ready except that we have no suitable ensign to display over the Star Fort and it is my desire to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance.&quot; A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill&#x27;s brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, &quot;one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, first quality bunting&quot; and another flag 17 by 25 feet.&quot; 

In early summer 1813, she began the job, and as a task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help including her daughter Caroline; her two nieces, Eliza and Margaret Young, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young; an apprenticing indentured servant, Grace Wisher; and also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill&#x27;s team was able to complete the job in six weeks. Pickersgill&#x27;s daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag:

The flag being so very large, mother was obliged to obtain permission from the proprietors of Claggetts brewery which was in our neighborhood, to spread it out in their malt house; and I remember seeing my mother down on the floor, placing the stars: after the completion of the flag, she superintended the topping of it, having it fastened in the most secure manner to prevent its being torn away by (cannon) balls: the wisdom of her precaution was shown during the engagement: many shots piercing it, but it still remained firm to the staff. Your father (Col. Armistead) declared that no one but the maker of the flag should mend it, and requested that the rents should merely be bound around.

The large flag contained over of fabric, and included 15 stripes and 15 stars, one for each of the 15 states of the union. The stars were made of cotton and the stripes and blue canton were of English wool bunting. Each stripe was wide and each of the stars measured across from tip to tip. The women did much of the work in the evening after the brewery closed, sometimes working until midnight, and Pickersgill delivered the flags to Fort McHenry on August 19, 1813, a full year before the Battle of Baltimore.

The main flag weighed about , and it took 11 men to raise it onto a flagpole. The result was an enormous American flag that could be seen for several miles from the Fort. On October 27, 1813 a receipt was given to Pickersgill and her niece Eliza Young in the amount of $405.90 for the larger flag, and $168.54 for the smaller one (which was also used at Fort McHenry as a storm flag). The small flag may have been flying when the British initially attacked Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on September 13, because of the inclement weather that night with the driving rainstorm (which would have made the woolen bunting material soggy and too heavy to blow out in any breeze). However, it was Pickersgill&#x27;s large flag that was flying over the fort at daybreak on September 14, 1814, after the British had ceased firing on the fort. A diary entry from a British sub-altern on board ship and recently returned from the North Point battlefield, George Glebe, described that sunny morning when the Americans at the distant fort &quot;fired their (&quot;wake-up&quot;) morning gun salute and raised a splendid ensign&quot; over the battlements. While negotiating a prisoner exchange aboard a British ship, Francis Scott Key saw the flag, and this inspired him to pen the words to the poem &quot;The Defence of Fort McHenry&quot; that later became the National Anthem of the United States in 1931.

After the 1814 battle, George Armistead took possession of the large flag, and after his death in 1818 his widow, Louisa Hughes Armistead, kept it. During her four decades of ownership, she allowed it to be displayed on a few occasions, and also removed pieces of it to be given as gifts, a common practice of the day. Following her death in 1861 the flag went to her daughter, Georgiana Armistead Appleton, and later to her grandson, Eben Appleton. The flag was moved to various locations over a 40-year period until 1907 when Eben Appleton loaned it to the Smithsonian. In 1912 the loan became permanent, and the flag underwent a variety of restorations. Beginning in December 1998, the flag began an $18 million conservation treatment (not a restoration) and now this flag that was hand crafted by Pickersgill and her helpers in 1813 is one of the most important artifacts, and the centerpiece of the redesigned National Museum of American History.

==Later life==

By 1820 Pickersgill had become sufficiently successful in her business to purchase the house she had been renting, and she lived there for the remainder of her life. Her business success allowed her to become active in addressing social issues such as housing, job placement, and financial aid for disadvantaged women, decades before these issues became prominent concerns in society. The Impartial Female Humane Society had been established to help needy Baltimore families with educating their children, and to help destitute women find employment. Pickersgill served as the president of this society from 1828 to 1851, and under her presidency a home for aged women was finally opened in West Baltimore in 1851 after a long planning and construction process. Following her tenure as president, a home for aged men was then established adjacent to the women&#x27;s home in 1869. In 1959 the two homes were combined and moved from west Baltimore to Towson, Maryland, and in 1962 the new facility was named the &quot;Pickersgill Retirement Community&quot; in honor of the woman who had been instrumental in its creation.

Pickersgill died on October 4, 1857, and is buried in Loudon Park Cemetery in southwest Baltimore. Her daughter Caroline erected a monument for her, and later the genealogical heritage organization United States Daughters of 1812 and the Star Spangled Banner Flag House Association, which had organized to save and preserve the Flag House in 1927, placed a bronze plaque at the foot of her grave.

==Legacy==

Besides making the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the words to the United States National Anthem, Pickersgill is also remembered for her humanitarian contributions to society, evident in her decades-long presidency of the Impartial Female Humane Society, which eventually evolved into the Pickersgill Retirement Community of Towson, Maryland. She is also remembered for her house, known as the Star-Spangled Banner Flag House and later renamed the Flag House and Star-Spangled Banner Museum, which stands at the corner of East Pratt Street and Albemarle Street in eastern downtown Baltimore and is a National Historic Landmark.

About the time of the American Bicentennial, noted artist Robert McGill Mackall created a painting depicting Mary Pickersgill and her helpers in the malt house of a brewery, sewing the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. A copy of the painting is maintained by the Maryland Historical Society.

Mary Pickersgill was the namesake of a World War II Liberty ship, the SS &quot;Mary Pickersgill&quot;, launched in 1944. In addition, a type of flower is known as the Mary Pickersgill Rose.

Concerning Pickersgill&#x27;s famous flag, In 1998, I. Michael Heyman, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution wrote:

==Family==

Pickersgill&#x27;s uncle, Colonel Benjamin Flower, fought during the American Revolutionary War, and was presented a sword by General George Washington, commander of the Continental Army. The presentation was made for Flower&#x27;s masterful evacuation of Philadelphia during the British occupation of that city, the first American capital, in late 1776.

Of Pickersgill&#x27;s five siblings, her oldest brother, William Young, was also a flag maker, and it is likely that his two daughters were Pickersgill&#x27;s nieces that assisted in making the Star Spangled Banner flag. Her sister, Hannah Young, married Captain Jesse Fearson, a privateer ship commander during the War of 1812 who was captured by the British and imprisoned in Havana, Cuba, before later escaping.

Pickersgill&#x27;s one surviving child, Caroline (1800-1884), married John Purdy (1795-1837). The couple apparently had no surviving children, because in a letter written late in her life to the daughter of George Armistead, Purdy called herself &quot;widowed and childless.&quot; She had become somewhat destitute late in life, and in the same letter requested some financial assistance, but also provided some history about her mother and the making of the Star-Spangled Banner flag.

<doc id="1330067" wikidata="Q3987177" url="?curid=1330067" title="The Garden (John Foxx album)">
<text>The Garden is a 1981 album by John Foxx, the follow-up to his debut solo album &quot;Metamatic&quot;, released the previous year. By comparison, it features more diverse instrumentation and romantic stylings.

==Production and style==
The sound and subject matter of &quot;The Garden&quot; were informed by a number of factors: the composer&#x27;s Catholic upbringing and early exposure to Latin mass and Gregorian chant; his exploration of England&#x27;s countryside, architecture and history following the release of &quot;Metamatic&quot;; and the song &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, which had been written during sessions for the Ultravox album of the same name but was not included on the record, even though its title was used.

Another connection between &quot;The Garden&quot; and &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; the album was the presence of guitarist Robin Simon, whose textured style had been a significant influence on the sound of the earlier release. Whereas on &quot;Metamatic&quot; the only conventional instrument had been bass guitar, Foxx used a full band of musicians on &quot;The Garden&quot; to play electric and acoustic guitar, electric bass, piano, and acoustic percussion, in addition to synthesizers and drum machines.

Regarding the album&#x27;s title and the influence of his travels through England, in a 1981 interview with Bruce Elder on Australian radio Triple J Foxx said, &quot;&#x27;The Garden&#x27; seemed to be a pretty good metaphor because I found a lot of gardens that were overgrown and ruined and a lot of very grand buildings that were almost decaying - but I found them a lot more beautiful than they were in their original state, being overgrown&quot;.

The opening track, &quot;Europe After the Rain&quot;, encapsulated the style of the album as a whole, featuring discreet synthesizer work in concert with piano, acoustic guitar and a digital drum machine; its title came from a Max Ernst painting. The tune of &quot;Night Suit&quot; betrayed a funk influence, whilst its lyrics were among many on the album that alluded to &#x27;The Quiet Man&#x27;, an alternative persona Foxx had developed prior to Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; and which inspired one of its key songs, &quot;Quiet Men&quot;. Foxx saw The Quiet Man as the epitome of detachment and observation, and claimed to often write from his perspective.

Two songs that reflected the influence of church music and prayer were 
&quot;Pater Noster&quot; and the final/title track. The former was played entirely by Foxx, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer sung in Latin against an electronic disco beat and the composer’s &#x27;Human Host&#x27;, a collection of tapes, vocoders and synthesizer sounds. The latter was a manifestation of the inspiration Foxx took from rural England and cathedral architecture; musically it also bore some resemblance to the final track on &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, &quot;Just for a Moment&quot;.

==Release and aftermath==
&quot;The Garden&quot; spent six weeks in the UK charts in 1981, peaking at #24. Initial vinyl copies included a glossy booklet called &quot;Church&quot;, with words and photographs by Foxx. &quot;Europe After the Rain&quot; b/w &quot;This Jungle&quot; (plus &quot;You Were There&quot; on 12-inch) was released on 21 August 1981 as the first single, a month prior to the album, making #40. &quot;Dancing Like a Gun&quot; b/w &quot;Swimmer 2&quot; (plus &quot;Swimmer 1&quot; on 12-inch) followed on 30 October 1981 but did not chart. The non-album B-sides appear on the 2001 reissue of &quot;The Garden&quot;. The album, particularly its title track, is generally cited as having influenced Foxx&#x27;s current ambient output, &quot;Cathedral Oceans&quot; (1995) and its sequels.

<text>Coastlines is a 2002 dramatic film written and directed by Victor Nuñez. It is the third of three films by Nuñez set in the Florida Panhandle after &quot;Ruby in Paradise&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1997). The film made its debut at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival but was not released until 2006 as it could not find a distributor.

==Plot==
Sonny Mann (Timothy Olyphant) is released early from prison and returns home to the Florida Panhandle and tries to collect $200,000 owed to him by his former cohorts, Fred Vance (William Forsythe) and his nephew Eddie (Josh Lucas). He enters into a love triangle with best friend Dave Lockhart (Josh Brolin), a sheriff, and his wife, Ann Lockhart (Sarah Wynter).

<text>Shishaldin Volcano, or Mount Shishaldin (), is one of six active volcanoes on Unimak Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is the highest mountain peak of the Aleutian Islands, rising to a height of 9,373 ft (2,857 m) above sea level. Shishaldin&#x27;s magma supply is generated via flux melting above the Aleutian Trench, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. Due to its remote location and frequently inclement weather, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) monitors the volcano remotely via satellite and a seismic network deployed in 1997. Shishaldin is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, with 40 confirmed eruptions in the last 11,700 years. Notably, Shishaldin produced a sub-Plinian (VEI 3) eruption in 1999.

==Name==
The Aleuts named the volcano Sisquk or Sisagux, meaning &quot;mountain which points the way when I am lost.&quot; The spelling &quot;Shishaldin&quot; comes from the Russian version, &quot;Шишалдина&quot;, of the Aleut name.

== Geography and geology ==
Shishaldin is located on Unimak Island, the easternmost of the Aleutian Islands. The nearest settlement to the volcano is False Pass (population ~100) at 45 km away. The view of Shishaldin from False Pass is obscured by the Round Top and Isanotski volcanoes, preventing direct observations of eruptions in many instances. The upper 6,600 ft (2,000 m) is almost entirely covered by glacial snow and ice. In all, Shishaldin&#x27;s glacial shield covers about 35 sq mi (91 km2). The Shishaldin cone is less than 10,000 years old and is constructed atop the remnants of the ancestral volcano. The modern cone is highly symmetrical, with near-perfect circular topographic contours above 6,500 ft (2,000 m). The Shishaldin edifice contains about 300 km3 (72 cu mi) of material. A very steady steam plume rises from its small summit crater which is about 500 ft (150 m) across and slightly breached along the north rim. The ancestral cone is exposed on the west and northeast sides of the volcano between 1,500-1,800 m elevation and hosts rougher topography than the modern cone. The west and northwest sides of the volcano are home to over 50 flank vents. These flank vents consist mostly of cinder cones with some maars and tuff cones; most vents produced explosive eruptions, however some cinder cones are associated with lava flows from effusive eruptions. In appearance, the volcano can vary from nearly completely white to almost all black, depending on the occurrence of ashfall deposits.

Shishaldin is one of many volcanic centers located along the 4,000 km Aleutian Arc, which stretches from Kamchatka, Russia, to mainland Alaska, United States. The Aleutian Arc is formed where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. Subduction is orthogonal in the eastern 2,500 km of the arc, giving rise to active volcanism, and becomes increasingly oblique westward until the plate interface becomes strike-slip near Buldir Island and volcanism ceases. Magma generation occurs via flux melting, where the dehydration of hydrous minerals in subducted oceanic crust inputs water into and lowers the melting temperature of the peridotite mantle wedge above the subducted slab. Average magma composition in the Aleutian arc is typically basaltic to basaltic andesite. In addition to active volcanism, the Aleutian Arc hosts significant seismicity, with roughly 70 MW 7.0+ earthquakes since 1900. The rupture zone of the 1957 MW 7.1 earthquake extended to the western side of Unimak Island (where Shishaldin is located). In addition, the 1946 MW 8.6 megathrust earthquake, associated with a significant tsunami, ruptured offshore of Unimak Island.

==Eruptive history==
This volcano has had many recorded eruptions during the 19th and 20th centuries, and a couple of reports of volcanic activity in the area during the 18th century may have referred to Shishaldin as well. Written record of eruptive activity began in 1775 by Russian explorers and traders in the Aleutians. There have been 40 confirmed Holocene eruptions ranging from 0-3 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), the majority of which were VEI 2 eruptions. Shishaldin produces basaltic eruptions, typically Strombolian in style, and frequently produces ash clouds which rise tens of kilometers into the atmosphere. Lava flows are occasionally produced by the summit crater.

Because Shishaldin is rarely visible due to its remote location and inclement weather, Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) relies on remote sensing to detect eruptive activity. In 1997, AVO installed a network of six seismometers and one pressure sensor on the volcano. AVO also uses satellites sensitive to thermal anomalies and volcanic plumes to monitor Shishaldin for eruptive activity.

=== 1999 eruption ===
Shishaldin displayed thermal signals of unrest detected by satellite on February 9, 1999. Throughout February and March, remotely detected thermal and seismic signals exceeded background levels. Strombolian activity was confirmed on 17 April via overflight. Shishaldin produced a sub-Plinian (VEI 3) eruption on 19 April, ejecting basaltic tephra in two separate plumes which rose 9 and 16 km into the atmosphere. The plumes deposited ash and tephra on the southern slopes of the volcano and into the Pacific Ocean, and several lahars were documented on the north flanks. Intense Strombolian activity persisted for ~3 hours after the large explosive events. Several days of intermittent Strombolian activity followed, ash plumes again depositing material on the southern slopes of the volcano. The largest thermal anomaly and most significant seismic activity of the 1999 eruptive sequence were detected on 22–23 April; although there were no direct observations of the activity, the seismic and thermal signals closely resembled the intense Strombolian activity of 19 April. Activity then declined, although intermittent Strombolian activity continued for several months afterward.

Since the 1999 eruption, it has maintained seismic activity, typically having very low-magnitude volcanic earthquakes (most are below magnitude 1) every 1–2 minutes. During this period of non-eruptive seismic activity, it has been puffing steam, with puffs also occurring about every 1–2 minutes. There were reports in 2004 of small quantities of ash being emitted with the steam. In 2014, a low-level effusive eruption cycle started which lasted into 2016.

=== 2019 eruption ===
A new period of activity started in July 2019 with incandescence observed in the summit crater during a time of increased seismic activity. On July 23, an active lava lake and minor spattering within the summit crater was observed. A new lava effusion event began on October 13 advancing over the next several weeks. The summit cone partially collapsed on November 25, producing a pyroclastic flow down the northwest side of the volcano and a new lava flow. On December 12, a short-lived explosion from Shishaldin expelled an ash cloud to . During late December, eruptive activity continued with lava flows and low-level explosive activity at the summit. On January 3, 2020, seismicity led to an ash cloud eruption that reached as high as . Another large ash cloud was emitted on January 19, 2020. This event ended shortly afterwards with an abrupt end in seismicity. The lava flows emitted during the eruptive events have cut deep channels in the snow and ice mantle of the volcano&#x27;s north slope.

=== 2023 eruption ===
After more than two years of dormancy, another eruptive cycle began and on 14 July 2023, the volcano emitted ash plumes up to high after several explosions at the summit. Fourteen significant explosive events occurred at Shishaldin between 12 July and 3 November 2023. For approximately a week following the November 3 explosive event, activity consisted of frequent small explosions, steam and gas emissions, and collapse events around the summit crater rim. By January 2024, only minor steam emissions and small events deep in the summit crater continued. The Alaska Volcano Observatory declared this eruptive cycle ended by late August 2024. As a result of the collapses in the summit during this eruption, the previously symmetrical summit crater now has a deep east-west trending notch.

==Climbing==
The first recorded ascent of Shishaldin was in 1932, by G. Peterson and two companions. Given the straightforward nature of the climbing (Alaska Grade 1, snow up to 40 degree slope), it is possible that an earlier ascent occurred, either by native Aleuts, Russians, or other visitors. Shishaldin is rather unique in that its appearance changes very little to a climber during an ascent. A group climbing Shishaldin in May, 2005 set a base camp at on the east side after a four day hike and ski trip from the village of False Pass. As they climbed the cone, they noted &quot;we could never believe it was so tall since the summit always looked &#x27;so close&#x27;. Yet it never seemed to get any closer!&quot; It took that group about 8 hours to climb to the top. Shishaldin is a popular ski descent ( vertical) for local climbers (of whom there are few). Due to its remoteness, Shishaldin is not often climbed by outsiders.
