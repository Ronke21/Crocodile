<text>Historic Houses (formerly, and still for legal purposes, known as the Historic Houses Association or HHA) is a not-for-profit organisation that represents well over a thousand independently owned historic country houses, castles and gardens throughout the United Kingdom.

==History==
The association originated as the Historic Houses Committee of the British Tourist Authority, and was independently established in 1973 to help owners maintain and conserve significant homes in the interests of the nation&#x27;s heritage.

In 1974, the HHA participated in a campaign in response to the publication of a governmental green paper on a proposed wealth tax. The campaign, which also involved the National Trust and the predecessor of The Arts Society, drew public attention to the problems such a tax could cause for historic buildings and national art collections. The tax was not implemented, and the HHA subsequently continued to lobby for tax exemptions for heritage sites and to promote private ownership of historic houses. Today, Historic Houses represents, advises, and helps to publicise its member properties, and runs an access scheme for the general public.

While a large majority of member places are privately owned (and most of those are still lived in), houses, castles, and gardens cared for by independent charitable trusts, local authorities, institutions, or businesses are also eligible for membership, and there are several hundred such member places represented. Typically a dwelling must be listed at Grade I or Grade II* (in England &amp; Wales; or the equivalent level in Scotland or Northern Ireland), but a substantial minority of member places are large Grade II houses.

More than half of member properties (c. 800) open their doors in some way, from visitors on a day or, special tour, or school trip, through to film locations, weddings and events, or as memorable places to stay. Historic Houses member attractions between them receive more than 28 million visitors each year.

Historic Houses offers a &#x27;visitor membership&#x27; to the public; several hundred participating house and garden attractions offer card-holders free entry. Several hundred more houses that do not normally open offer occasional accompanied tours, which can be booked through the association&#x27;s &#x27;Invitation to View&#x27; platform. The association publishes &quot;Historic House&quot; magazine quarterly.

Historic Houses runs five awards for its member places: The Garden of the Year, The Restoration Award, The Frances Garnham Education Award, The Sustainability Award, and The Collections Award.

<text>Poncelet is the remains of a lunar impact crater that is located near the northern limb of the Moon. It lies to the east-northeast of the crater Pascal and northwest of Anaximenes. Like the latter formation, Poncelet is a worn, eroded formation with an interior that has been flooded, either with lava or possibly ejecta. The outer rim is a low, circular ridge with a narrow break to the south and a wider breach to the northeast. The interior floor is pock-marked with many tiny craterlets, the most notable of which is Poncelet H, located just to the southeast of the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Poncelet.

<doc id="1316860" wikidata="Q6956987" url="?curid=1316860" title="Nabokov's Congeries">
<text>Nabokov&#x27;s Congeries was a collection of work by Vladimir Nabokov published in 1968 and reprinted in 1971 as &quot;The Portable Nabokov&quot;. It was edited by Page Stegner. Because Nabokov supervised its production less than a decade before he died, it is useful in attempting to identify which works Nabokov considered to be his best, especially among his short stories.

The text of &quot;The Assistant Producer&quot; contained in &quot;Nabokov&#x27;s Congeries&quot; omits the story&#x27;s final two paragraphs, which had apparently been inadvertently dropped from all English-language editions of the story subsequent to the first. This was explained by the author&#x27;s son in his introduction to the posthumously published collection The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov (1995), in which the story appears with its final paragraphs restored.

<doc id="1316862" wikidata="Q1747752" url="?curid=1316862" title="De Forest (crater)">
<text>De Forest is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It is located in the far southern hemisphere, to the west of the large walled plain Zeeman and due south of the crater Numerov. Because of its proximity to the southern pole, this crater receives sunlight at an oblique angle when it is on the illuminated half of the Moon.

This is a relatively young formation with features that have not been significantly worn by impacts. The rim is sharp-edged and circular, but somewhat irregular with a small outer . The wide inner wall has multiple s, and sections near the rim give the appearance of slumping. At the midpoint of the irregular floor is a relatively large, angular central peak.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to De Forest.

<text>The T Stock was a series of electric trains originally built in various batches by Metropolitan-Vickers and the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company for the Metropolitan Railway in 1927–31 for use on electric services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth, though rarely some worked on the Uxbridge branch.

==History==
The earlier batches were built from wood and sandwiched trailers of 1898–1923 vintage, however later batches were steel in construction and worked with newly built trailers. As built, the group has some variations in equipment, mostly to allow use with existing stock such as the and leading to incompatibilities within the class, however upon transfer to London Transport this was rectified and the entire fleet largely standardized about 1938.

T stock never ran to Aylesbury, though they latterly worked to Chesham and Amersham after electrification. Prior to this, trains destined to beyond Rickmansworth were hauled by Metropolitan Vickers Bo-Bo electric locomotives as far as Rickmansworth, where a changeover to steam traction occurred.

These electric multiple unit trains had slam doors with rounded tops, thought to be less prone to damage if accidentally opened in the tunnels north of Baker Street.

In the late 1940s coaches 2752 and 2707 were rebuilt as experimental air-door trailers number 17000 and 20000 respectively. The first (17000) employed an unusual seating layout with gangways on both sides of the car. The air doors were controlled manually by passengers with buttons to open and close them. In 1949 it was modified with a conventional centre gangway to match its second variant, and being renumbered 17001. The two cars were permanently coupled and remained in service until 1953, their work as prototypes for the A60 Stock being completed.

The &#x27;T&#x27; stock was replaced from 1961 by the A60 and A62 Stock, with the final train running on 5 October 1962.

In 1961, two withdrawn driving motors were converted to sleet locomotives. These were numbered ESL118A and ESL118B, having previously been 2758 and 2749 respectively. After withdrawal, both units were preserved, eventually being located at the Spa Valley Railway but now moved to Quainton Road.

==Equipment details==
The first coaches of the first batch (1927) had Westinghouse brakes, Metropolitan-Vickers control systems and MV153 motors; they were used to replace the motor cars working with .

The rest of the coaches from the first batch had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes instead. They ran with converted of the 1920/23 batches to form &#x27;MV&#x27; stock.

The second batch (of 1929) were very similar in terms of equipment to the first coaches of 1927 and were interchangeable. This batch included specially built trailers and when running with which were known as &#x27;MW&#x27; trains; the W indicating Westinghouse Air Brakes were fitted.

The last batch (1931) were like the previous batch but had equipment by the GEC and used WT545 motors. They were found not to be as compatible as hoped, and remained segregated until the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) standardisation of Metropolitan Railway rolling stock.

When standardised, the MV stock trains were converted to air brakes. The Bogie Stock coaches in the W stock formations were withdrawn eventually and replaced by seven more converted Dreadnought coaches. Following a reshuffle this allowed 9×8 coach and 10×6 coach trains, which were then designated &#x27;T&#x27; stock. 22 motor cars remained spare however, but by 1961 this had been reduced to six spare.

<text>Hampstead Norreys (alternatively spelt &quot;Hampstead Norris&quot; as it is pronounced) is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England. It is centred on the River Pang, north of Newbury. As well as the nucleus of Hampstead Norreys, the parish includes the hamlets of Bothampstead, Eling and Wyld Court. The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Hanstede&quot;.

==Amenities==
In March 2011, a community shop was opened in the village, run by local volunteers. Shares in the shop were sold to village residents. It was the first community shop to be opened in a West Berkshire village since the 1990s.

==The Living Rainforest==
Wyld Court is home to The Living Rainforest, an indoor glass house tropical rainforest with plants, animals and butterflies. It is an ecological centre, an educational centre and a visitor attraction.

==Historic buildings==
The village parish church of St Mary the Virgin is noted for its Norman architecture. In the nearby woods are the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle.

==Aviation==
===World War II===
The village was close to the wartime airfield of RAF Hampstead Norris, an RAF Bomber Command Operational Training Unit (OTU) station. The airfield was host to a small number of squadrons of Wellington bombers. The site was bombed on 16 September 1940 by the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. In 1945, the station was used by squadrons of Mosquito fighter bombers and became an ammunition storage depot as part of the Bramley Central Ammunition Depot near Basingstoke after its closure in 1946. Little of the wartime station now remains. There are four remaining pillboxes around where the airfield was, and a few air-raid shelters in the woods. Part of the bomb storage site remains.

===Today===
The site still maintains a modern link with aviation with a farm strip used by a Tiger Moth biplane. It is now known as Haw Farm, part of the Yattendon Estate. An impression of the old runway layout of airfield can still be seen from the air. On the edge of the perimeter track is a light beacon and an important VOR beacon known as Compton (CPT), named after the nearby village, which is used as a primary navigational aid for airway routes between European airports such as (Heathrow) and North America.

==Education==
Hampstead Norreys has a small rural primary school which has served the community for over 150 years. The school is federated with the Ilsleys Primary School, with which it shares a headteacher.

==Transport==
From 18 February 2013, Buses 6 and 6A from Newbury serve the village. The nearest station is which has regular services to east and west. Hampstead Norris railway station was a calling point on the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway from 1872 until closure in 1962.

== Sport and leisure ==
The Dean Field is the local park in Hampstead Norreys. It contains football and cricket pitches and a children&#x27;s play area. On the north side of the field is Hampstead Norreys village hall. It is considerably larger than the village halls in surrounding villages. On the south side is Eling estate, a large wooded area (consisting of Park Wood, Westbrook Copse, Down Wood and Elingpark Copse) backed by a path, on what remains of the old Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway, running between Hermitage and Compton, the two nearest villages.

<text>Destructive dilemma is the name of a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. It is the inference that, if &quot;P&quot; implies &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot; implies &quot;S&quot; and either &quot;Q&quot; is false or &quot;S&quot; is false, then either &quot;P&quot; or &quot;R&quot; must be false. In sum, if two conditionals are true, but one of their consequents is false, then one of their antecedents has to be false. &quot;Destructive dilemma&quot; is the disjunctive version of &quot;modus tollens&quot;. The disjunctive version of &quot;modus ponens&quot; is the constructive dilemma. The destructive dilemma rule can be stated:

:formula_1

where the rule is that wherever instances of &quot;formula_2&quot;, &quot;formula_3&quot;, and &quot;formula_4&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_5&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line.

==Formal notation==
The &quot;destructive dilemma&quot; rule may be written in sequent notation:

: formula_6

where formula_7 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_8 is a syntactic consequence of formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 in some logical system;

and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

:formula_12

where formula_13, formula_14, formula_15 and formula_16 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

==Natural language example==

:If it rains, we will stay inside.
:If it is sunny, we will go for a walk.
:Either we will not stay inside, or we will not go for a walk, or both.
:Therefore, either it will not rain, or it will not be sunny, or both.

==Proof==
==Example proof==
The validity of this argument structure can be shown by using both conditional proof (CP) and reductio ad absurdum (RAA) in the following way:

<doc id="1316897" wikidata="Q665993" url="?curid=1316897" title="Fermi (crater)">
<text>Fermi is a large lunar impact crater of the category named a walled plain. It was named after Italian-American physicist and Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi. It lies on the far side of the Moon and can not be viewed from the Earth. Thus this feature must be viewed from an orbiting spacecraft.

The most notable aspect of Fermi is that the large and prominent crater Tsiolkovskiy intrudes into its southeastern rim. Unlike Tsiolkovskiy, however, the interior of Fermi is not covered by dark basaltic lava, and so it is barely distinguishable from the surrounding rugged and battered terrain. If it were located on the near side of the Moon, however, this would be one of the largest visible craters, with a dimension roughly equal to the crater Humboldt, lying several hundred kilometers to the west-southwest.

This formation has been significantly eroded and damaged by subsequent impacts, and several notable craters lie across the rim and within the basin. Delporte is the most notable of these, lying across the northwest rim. Just to the east and inside the northern rim of Fermi is Litke. The smaller crater Xenophon is centered across the southern rim. In the southern half of the floor are the craters Diderot and Babakin.

The rim, where it survives, is the most intact along the northern half. The southern half of the rim has been nearly obliterated, forming an irregular stretch of ground. The interior floor of Fermi has been modified by the creation of Tsiolkovskiy, with striations in the northeastern floor of Fermi, and parallel ridges along the western rim of Tsiolkovskiy. The remaining sections of the floor is somewhat more level, although pock-marked by myriads of tiny craterlets. The central section of the floor in particular has several clustered crater formations.

Prior to formal naming in 1970 by the IAU, the crater was known as &quot;Basin V&quot;.

<doc id="1316903" wikidata="Q316036" url="?curid=1316903" title="Ryan Dunn">
<text>Ryan Matthew Dunn (June 11, 1977 – June 20, 2011) was an American stunt performer, television personality, and actor. He was one of the stars of the MTV reality stunt show &quot;Jackass&quot; and its film franchise.

Born in Medina, Ohio, Dunn rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the CKY crew with his long-time friend Bam Margera, with whom he performed extreme stunts and pranks and recorded them on video, which led to the rise of &quot;Jackass&quot; in the early 2000s. He also hosted the TV series &quot;Homewrecker&quot; and &quot;Proving Ground&quot;, and appeared in the feature films &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot; and &quot;Street Dreams&quot;, as well as in Margera&#x27;s films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Dunn died in a car crash in 2011 at the age of 34.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Medina, Ohio. He grew up in Williamsville, New York, before moving to West Chester, Pennsylvania, where he went to West Chester East High School and where he met fellow Jackass star Bam Margera on the first day of school.

== Career ==

Dunn took part in the characteristic stunts that made &quot;Jackass&quot; famous, and featured in five released films, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot;, &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, and &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot;. In 2006, Dunn and Bam Margera participated in the Gumball 3000 road rally in Margera&#x27;s Lamborghini Gallardo. He later went on a tour with Don Vito called &quot;The Dunn and Vito Rock Tour&quot; for which the DVD was released on March 20, 2007. Dunn and Margera again participated in the rally in 2008.

Bam Margera stated during a December 2, 2008, radio interview with &quot;Big O and Dukes&quot; of 106.7 WJFK-FM, that he and Dunn would be going to Italy to film &quot;Where the F*%# Are My Ancestors&quot;. That same month, Dunn appeared on the episode &quot;Smut&quot; of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in December 2008. He is also featured in a movie called &quot;Street Dreams&quot; which was released in spring 2009. He co-starred along with Rob Dyrdek and Paul Rodriguez Jr. Dunn was also featured on a show with fellow &quot;Jackass&quot; star Bam Margera about them traveling through Europe in a &quot;Viva la Bam&quot;-like show called &quot;Bam&#x27;s World Domination&quot; for Spike. He appeared in &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, which was released on October 15, 2010.

Dunn co-hosted G4&#x27;s &quot;Proving Ground&quot; along with Jessica Chobot, which made its premiere on June 14, 2011, six days before his death. However, according to a G4 spokesperson, the channel decided to postpone the airing of further episodes. The spokesperson added, &quot;The show is off the schedule as of today until we discuss next steps.&quot; On June 27, G4 announced they would air the remaining episodes starting on July 19, 2011. At the time of his death, Dunn was working on the film &quot;Welcome to the Bates Motel&quot;. The film was later renamed &quot;The Bates Haunting&quot; and was released in 2013.

== Personal life ==

From 2002 to his death, he was in a long-term relationship with Angie Cuturic, who had a part in Margera&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;&quot; and later &quot;Minghags&quot;. Dunn had several tattoos of Cuturic, including in his inner arm and left ring finger.

During shooting of the closing scenes for &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; in 2006, Dunn injured his shoulder during one of his final scenes, in which he and co-star Bam Margera are pulled out of shot by a running horse by a rope tied around their feet. Dunn dropped straight onto his shoulder, causing damage to the muscles and leading to a blood clot that was at one point life-threatening, due to its proximity to his heart and brain. While seeking treatment for it and Lyme disease, Dunn became depressed, eventually cutting off all contact with his friends, co-workers, and others for nearly two years, and did not participate in &quot;Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover&quot;, or any subsequent events related to the films and series. He eventually returned to the Jackass cast in the production of &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; and &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; later saying that he was happy to rejoin the cast and had more enjoyment working on &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; than any previous film endeavors.

== Death ==

On June 20, 2011, at around 3:30 a.m. EDT, Dunn and Zachary Hartwell, a production assistant on &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, were returning from Barnaby&#x27;s West Chester, a West Chester bar, in Dunn&#x27;s Porsche 911 GT3 when Dunn veered off the road and struck a tree, after which the Porsche burst into flames in West Goshen Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Both Dunn, who had turned 34 nine days prior, and 30-year-old Hartwell were killed in the crash. 

Hours before the crash, Dunn had posted a photo to his Twitter account of himself and Hartwell drinking at the bar. He was identified in the police report as the vehicle&#x27;s driver, and a subsequent toxicology report showed a blood alcohol content of 0.196%—more than twice the state&#x27;s legal limit of 0.08%. The police report stated &quot;speed may have been a contributing factor in the crash&quot; and preliminary investigations suggested the car had been traveling between in a zone.

Prior to the drunk-driving crash that resulted in his death, Dunn had been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol, resulting in him completing a treatment program as part of his sentence. &quot;In 2005, Dunn was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and entered a first-offender program that allowed him to clear his record after a certain period of good behavior,&quot; according to Patrick Carmody, Chester County Assistant District Attorney.

=== Wrongful-death lawsuit ===
In August 2012, the parents of Zachary Hartwell filed a civil suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, naming the co-administrators of Dunn&#x27;s estate as defendants, along with Barnaby&#x27;s West Chester. The suit claims negligence and recklessness, as well as wrongful death in the incident that killed Hartwell.

The plaintiffs claim that Dunn displayed negligence and recklessness in failing to have his vehicle under adequate and proper control, operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol, operating his vehicle at an excessive speed and violently veering off a road and into a tree, among other alleged transgressions. They are seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, as well as interest, court costs and &quot;delay damages as the law may allow.&quot;

Hartwell&#x27;s parents sought to recover from Dunn&#x27;s estate the following: the costs of their son&#x27;s funeral, wages due for his behind-the-scenes and stunt work on various &quot;Jackass&quot; projects, the projected loss of income from his premature death, pain and suffering, and other damages, but they did not specify an amount.

== Legacy ==
Dunn is remembered by friends and fans alike as the &quot;go-to guy for outrageous stunts that even such stalwarts as Steve-O weren&#x27;t willing to try&quot; and &quot;the kind of guy who would do anything for a friend,&quot; gaining the nickname &quot;Random Hero&quot;.

Following the news of his death, Dickhouse Productions and the producers of the show released the following statement:

I don&#x27;t really know what to say right now everybody, because the sadness is overwhelming, but today we lost one of our own. Our brother Ryan Dunn has passed. He died in a car wreck in West Goshen, Pennsylvania this morning at 3 a.m.
 that&#x27;s tough to write. Our hearts go out to his family and his beloved Angie. Ryan will be missed and remembered by us all. Thanks for the kind words of support everybody.

Many celebrities expressed their grief and condolences on Twitter, including Sofia Coppola, Tom Green, Carey Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Tony Hawk, and his &quot;Jackass&quot; cast members.

Kings of Leon also paid homage to Dunn at their London Hyde Park concert by dedicating their song &quot;McFearless&quot; to him. Skrillex dedicated his remix of the song &quot;Cinema&quot; to Dunn after a moment of silence. Alkaline Trio also dedicated their song &quot;Goodbye Forever&quot; to Dunn on their fifteen-year anniversary tour. Singer/songwriter Roger Alan Wade wrote and composed the song &quot;The Light Outlives the Star&quot;, while also dedicating it to Dunn. Occasional &quot;Jackass&quot; member Loomis Fall also wrote the song &quot;Bid Farewell&quot; in memory of Dunn. Both songs were used in a music video tribute by Dickhouse Productions for its official website.

Dunn also came in at number three in top trending searches of 2011 on Google&#x27;s Zeitgeist report following his death.

On November 28, 2011, MTV aired an hour-long tribute to Dunn, where several details of his life previously unknown to the public were revealed as well as never-before-seen stunts he performed. Dunn&#x27;s parents, sister, friends and both &quot;Jackass&quot; and &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; cast mates recalled his early beginnings to final months.
The 2013 film &quot;Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa&quot; is dedicated to him, and the 2022 film &quot;Jackass Forever&quot; included a mid-credits tribute to Dunn. The 2022 film &quot;Jackass 4.5&quot; is also dedicated to him.

<doc id="1316910" wikidata="Q6378509" url="?curid=1316910" title="Katy Hill">
<text>Katy Hill (born 15 April 1971) is an English television presenter who has worked in television and radio in the UK since 1995. She presented the long-running children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 1995 to 2000 and the flagship Saturday morning series &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; from 2000 to 2001.

==Early life and education==
She was born in Poole, Dorset where her father, Chris, was then a curate (trainee vicar) at a local church. Katy has two siblings: an elder brother, Simon; and a younger sister, Naomi. Hill gained nine &#x27;O&#x27; levels and four &#x27;A&#x27; Levels at St. Edward&#x27;s Church of England School in Romford, London, and worked in a record shop before she started presenting. Hill worked for free at the local radio station BBC Essex, to gain the experience required to become a presenter.

==Career==
Hill began her media career with voluntary work in Essex at EastWard Hospital Television, and presented &quot;Katy&#x27;s Capers&quot; on BBC Essex, before transferring to Nickelodeon. Whilst working for BBC channel controllers and the Head of Children&#x27;s Television as a secretary, she bombarded the editor of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; with showreels, which resulted in her winning an audition place.

On 23 June 1995, Hill joined the Children&#x27;s BBC television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, ultimately leaving on 19 June 2000. Her assignments included living with a family in Mongolia for a week, training with the England football squad for a FIFA World Cup special, joining the Cirque du Soleil, and making objects from yoghurt pots and sticky-backed plastic. For her stint on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Hill won the 2000 Children&#x27;s BAFTA Award for Best Presenter. She returned for one edition on 30 March 2010, for the final programme to feature the dog Mabel.

As a result of her work on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Hill also presented &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Football Fever&quot; (she supports Newcastle United) and &quot;2000 to 1&quot; with Michael Parkinson, which was, for the final only, part of &quot;2000 Today&quot;. She also presented the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Holiday&quot; and went on to present the weekend breakfast show on 95.8 Capital FM. Hill has written for numerous magazines, including a regular column for &quot;Cosmopolitan Hair &amp; Beauty&quot;, &quot;Hello!&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot;. In both 2000 and 2001, she presented the final of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, the competition to select the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry for the annual Eurovision Song Contest.

In 2004, Hill appeared on the Channel 4 reality series, &quot;The Games&quot;, in which she came second overall in the female contenders, winning five out of the seven required disciplines. After Neil Fox quit as the long-running host of the networked &quot;Hit40UK&quot; (also in 2004), Hill - previously one of his stand-ins - was recruited, initially to co-host with Stephanie Hirst each Sunday, from the studios of Capital Radio in London. Hill chose to leave after a year, due to other commitments, and Hirst eventually went on to host the programme alone.

Hill co-presented the concert held in Trafalgar Square where the host of the 2012 Olympics was announced, for which London was a candidate. When London was announced as the victor, Hill was seen cheering and shouting with joy with Olympian Kelly Holmes. Hill is the face of Arm &amp; Hammer and has done three campaigns for the company.

In May 2010, Hill joined women&#x27;s lifestyle website iVillage.co.uk as a weekly blogger. She now hosts her own lifestyle and parenting blog at www.katyhill.com.

In late December 2010, Hill acted as relief co-presenter on ITV&#x27;s breakfast channel &quot;Daybreak&quot;. Years later, between February 2015 and July 2017, she co-presented Heart Breakfast for Heart Radio in the Four Counties region with former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; colleague Stuart Miles.

==Personal life==
Hill married childhood sweetheart and record producer Andrew Frampton in 1999. The marriage lasted two years before they divorced. Hill then began dating fellow &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; presenter Trey Farley. They became engaged after he proposed to her, while on holiday in Venice, and the couple married in Tuscany on 4 July 2004. They now live in Los Angeles, and have a daughter, Kaya Sky, born in 2006, and a son, Akira, born in 2007.

<doc id="1316913" wikidata="Q1603254" url="?curid=1316913" title="Helmholtz (lunar crater)">
<text>Helmholtz is a lunar impact crater, approximately 110 kilometers in diameter, that is located near the south-southeast limb of the Moon. Attached to the south-southeast rim of Helmholtz is the somewhat smaller crater Neumayer. The larger crater Boussingault is nearly attached to the west-southwestern rim. The crater is named after German physicist and physician Hermann von Helmholtz

== Description ==

The outer rim of Helmholtz is worn and rounded, although not significantly disrupted. The edge of the rim can still be discerned around the perimeter, although several small craters lie along the inner edge. One such crater lies across the inner southeast wall, and a pair occupies the opposite inner wall to the northeast. There are also a couple of smaller craterlets just inside the north rim.

The northern half of the interior floor is level and marked only by a few very tiny craterlets. The southern floor is more irregular due to the overlaying ejecta from Neumayer and Boussingault, and is marked by a pair of tiny craters in the southeast. There is no central peak.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Helmholtz.

<doc id="1316916" wikidata="Q1476105" url="?curid=1316916" title="Toyota Industries">
<text>is a Japanese machine maker. Originally, and still actively (), a manufacturer of automatic looms, it is the company from which Toyota Motor Corporation developed. It is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of forklift trucks measured by revenues.

==History==
=== 1920s ===
The company was founded on 18 November 1926 as Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. by Sakichi Toyoda, the inventor of a series of manual and machine-powered looms. The most significant of these was the 1924 Toyoda Automatic Loom, Type G, a completely automatic high-speed loom featuring the ability to change shuttles without stopping and dozens of other innovations. At the time it was the world&#x27;s most advanced loom, delivering a clear improvement in quality and a twenty-fold increase in productivity.
In 2007, this machine was registered as item No. 16 in the Mechanical Engineering Heritage of Japan as &quot;a landmark achievement that advanced the global textile industry and laid the foundation for the development of the Toyota Group.&quot;

=== 1930s ===
In 1933, the company established its automobile department, led by Kiichiro Toyoda, the eldest son of Sakichi Toyoda. This department was spun off as Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. in 1937 and is now known as Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyota Industries is one of 13 core companies of the Toyota Group. The company owns 8.48% of Toyota Motor and is the largest shareholder (excluding trust revolving funds). As a countermeasure against hostile merger and acquisition attempts, Toyota Motor currently holds 24.92% of common stock of its origin Toyota Industries.

=== 1940s ===
In 1940, the steel production department of Toyota Industries was spun off as Toyota Steel Works Ltd. (present Aichi Steel Corporation). In 1944, Toyota Industries&#x27;s Obu plant, which produces castings, began operations. Five years later, the Toyota Industries stock was listed on the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya Stock Exchanges.

=== 1950s ===
In 1952, Toyota Industries began producing press die for automobiles. One year later the Kyowa plant began to assemble automobiles and produce engines. In 1956 Toyota unveiled the Model LA 1-ton lift truck, this was the company&#x27;s first lift truck model. In 1957, Toyota Industries began producing D-type diesel engines. That same year, it launched the Model LAT .85-ton towing tractor. In the final year of the decade, Toyota Industries began producing the P-type gasoline engine.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, the Kyowa plant was modified to only assemble lift trucks. That same year, the company began producing the shovel loader and three cylinder crank shaft type compressor. That same year, Toyota Industries&#x27; Development Laboratories and Toyota Central Research were established with funds from ten Toyota group companies. In 1964, Toyota Industries was recognized by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International trade and industry as one of the first Japanese companies to export. Toyota Industries also unveiled their new automated continuous spinning system. In 1967, the Toyota Publica entered into production at the company&#x27;s Nagakusa plant. Toyota Industries had a monthly output of more than 1,000 units.

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, the company started assembling the Corolla. In 1973, Toyota Industries reached an output of 3,000 units. One year later, in 1974, production began on car air-conditioning compressors.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, the company started producing the JA air. By 1984, the engine division of Toyota Industries was separated from the vehicle division. In 1986, Toyota Industries received the Deming Application prize for quality control implementation. In 1988 Toyota Industrial Equipment is created in Indiana, US.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Toyota Industries reached the landmark of 5 million units produced. A year later, it set up an Environmental Committee.

==Current business==
Toyota Industries is active in five business areas: automotive, materials handling, electronics, logistics, and textile machinery.

Toyota-branded forklifts from Toyota Industries share the same logo as Toyota automobiles from Toyota Motor Corporation and are manufactured at the Toyota Material Handling Inc. (TMH), previously known as Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM), facility in Columbus, Indiana, for the US market. 

Toyota Material Handling USA (TMHU) was formally a separate company, breaking out dealer and sales divisions of the North American business. Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM) was formally focused on engineering, manufacturing and responsible for the daily production of forklifts. In 2018, these two divisions merged, combining the sales and manufacturing business functions into one business entity, now known as Toyota Material Handling Inc. (TMH).

Toyota Industries Corporation is under contract from Toyota Motor Corporation for the production of the Toyota RAV4. The company manufactures automotive engines for use in Toyota-branded automobiles such as Avensis, Corolla, Crown, and Land Cruiser.

In 2000, Toyota Industries acquired the Swedish-based forklift truck corporation BT Industries, alongside BT&#x27;s subsidiaries The Raymond Corporation and CESAB. Combined with Toyota Industries&#x27; materials handling division, this created the largest forklift company in the world, Toyota Material Handling Corporation.

In October 2012, Toyota Industries acquired Cascade Corp., a maker of attachments for forklifts, for a price of $728 million.

In 2017, Toyota Industries acquired Vanderlande, a manufacturer of automated material handling equipment, mostly for airports.

In 2021, Toyota Industries formed T-Hive as TICO&#x27;s solution for autonomous vehicle (AV) software solutions. The newly formed group focuses on warehouse, manufacturing, and airport logistics automation through AV&#x27;s.

In 2022, Toyota Industries acquired viastore, a provider of intralogistics systems, intralogistics software and supporting services.

===Looms===
In 2024, Toyota Industries was manufacturing two state-of-the-art looms: the JAT910 (air jet loom) and LWT810 (water jet loom). Both looms operate without shuttles. The water jet loom throws the weft through the warp threads using water, and thus can only be used with synthetic fibers. The air jet loom uses air to throw the weft, and thus can be use with any fiber.

<text>Sverka is a small river in Namsos Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It flows from the lakes called Finnvollvatnet and Furudalsvatnet northeast past the Sverkmoen area to the lake Øyungen. At Øyungen, it joins the river Øyensåa which continues until it joins with the Ferja river. There, it becomes the river Årgårdselva which flows to the Namsenfjorden. There is good salmon fishing in the lower parts of the river. The river system is about long.

<doc id="1316931" wikidata="Q5514964" url="?curid=1316931" title="GWR 4100 Class">
<text>The GWR 4100 Class was a class of steam locomotives in the Great Western Railway (GWR) of the United Kingdom.

The Badminton class express passenger 4-4-0 steam locomotives were introduced in 1897 as a development from the earlier Duke class. The name Badminton was chosen after the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Badminton estate, through which the GWR was building a new line to South Wales at the time.

Further modifications to the design resulted in the Atbara Class entering service in 1900, the names for these locomotives generally being taken from contemporary military engagements or senior army commanders. Later engines were named after cities of the British Empire.

The final batch of locomotives were named after varieties of garden plant and in consequence were known as the Flower Class.

These three types were later standardised and treated as a single class, so are listed together here. Four other prototype 4-4-0s, originally built in 1894 as the Armstrong Class, were also later rebuilt as Badmintons (see below).

This class were subject to the 1912 renumbering of GWR 4-4-0 locomotives, which saw the Bulldog Class gathered together in the series 3300–3455, and other types renumbered out of that series. This class took numbers 4100–4172 (of which numbers 4101–4120 had previously been used by Flower Class locomotives).

==Badminton class==

The first member of the class, no. 3292, was completed in December 1897 with a domed parallel boiler, a raised Belpaire firebox and an extended, built-up smokebox similar to that used on the Duke Class. The outside frames were curved over each driving wheel axle. It was named &quot;Badminton&quot; in April 1898. A batch of eleven locomotives, nos. 3293 to 3303, were completed between April and July 1898, with a further batch of eight, nos. 3304 to 3311, between September 1898 and January 1899. The class were the first locomotives on the GWR to be fitted with copper Belpaire fireboxes. The penultimate example, no. 3310 &quot;Waterford&quot;, was fitted with a domeless parallel boiler, a steel Belpaire firebox, and an enlarged cab.

The class were fitted with a steam chest and slide valves located beneath the cylinders. The valves were driven by Stephenson valve gear. This inverted arrangement of slide valves and steam chest, originally introduced by William Stroudley of the LB&amp;SCR, allowed the valves to drop away from the cylinder&#x27;s steam port faces when the regulator was closed, thus reducing wear. Because the steam chest was below the cylinders, and not between them, the latter could have an increased diameter. The centre line of the cylinders was inclined at an angle of 6° to the centre line of the valves, each centre line being aligned with the driving centre. This arrangement allowed the valve rods to be driven directly from the expansion link. First used on the Armstrong and 3031 Classes, this arrangement of cylinders, valves and valve gear was subsequently used on all GWR outside framed 4-4-0s, with the slide valves being eventually replaced by piston valves.

The crankpins for the coupling rods were placed in line with the corresponding inside crankpins for the connecting rods. This arrangement was also developed by Stroudley, who claimed that the motion of the inside cranks was smoothly transferred to the coupling rods, as happens in an outside-cylindered engine, where the connecting rod acts directly on a crankpin shared with the coupling rod. According to Stroudley, the axleboxes, bearing surfaces, hornblocks and coupling rods of locomotives with outside cylinders had a service life twice as long as those on inside-cylindered examples. However, by aligning the two cranks together, heavy balancing weights were required on the driving wheels, at 180° to the outside crank, to counteract the combined mass of the cranks and rods. The Badmintons had massive crescent-shaped balancing weights, which made the unmounted pairs of wheels difficult to handle in the workshop.

One locomotive of the Badminton Class was rebuilt with an experimental boiler. With the impending opening of the direct Reading-Taunton route which was of more undulating nature than the route via Bristol, there was a need to ensure that the most appropriate locomotives were provided. Churchward&#x27;s Chief Assistant, F.G. Wright, designed a large boiler with a very deep firebox, which was fitted to no. 3297 &quot;Earl Cawdor&quot; in July 1903. The boiler was designed to hold a large volume of hot water, forming a reservoir to assist the locomotive running along an undulating line. It also provided a steam space of as against the of the Standard No. 4 boiler, the larger of the two types of standard boiler fitted to the 4-4-0s. This increase in volume was intended to provide a reservoir of steam. The firebox was set deep between the coupled axles, with a horizontal grate. The intention with this was to allow a thick fire to be built up, increasing the area of the firebox in contact with the fire, and decreasing the temperature gradient along the firebox plates, thus reducing the risk of broken firebox stays. The boiler was pressed to . No. 3297 was also fitted with a large cab with two side windows, reminiscent of North Eastern practice. The locomotive was regularly rostered on the most demanding trains, but it soon became apparent that it was not up to the work demanded and it was relegated to secondary duties. In October 1906 the boiler was removed and replaced by a Standard No.4 boiler, the North Eastern style side-window cab having been replaced by a Churchward type in November 1904.

==Atbara class==

No. 3373 &quot;Atbara&quot; was built in April 1900, the first of a class of forty locomotives. Instead of the curved outside frames of the Badmintons, this class had straight-topped frames, which became the standard pattern for all subsequent outside-framed 4-4-0s. These straight frames were less prone to fracturing, because of the greater depth of plate between the coupled wheels. The Atbaras retained the Stroudley crank layout, cylinders, valves and valve gear of the Badmintons, but differed in the boiler, which was a parallel domeless Standard No. 2 type. No. 3405 &quot;Mauritius&quot; was reboilered in September 1902 with a tapered boiler, a prototype for the Standard No. 4 type. It was the first GWR 4-4-0 to be fitted with a tapered (or coned) boiler. Following this, another nine Atbaras, nos. 3400 to 3404 and 3406 to 3409, were rebuilt with No. 4 boilers between February 1907 and February 1909. The ten were added to the City Class. No. 3382 &quot;Mafeking&quot; was heavily damaged in an accident that occurred just after midnight on 25 June 1911 at . Adjudged unrepairable, it was withdrawn in September 1911, so was not included in the 1912 renumbering. The remaining Atbaras were withdrawn between April 1927 and May 1931.

==Flower class==

The Flower Class were fitted with deeper outside frames than the Atbaras, and a new design of bogie developed from the type fitted to the French de Glehn Atlantics. Twenty of the class were built between April 1910 and January 1913. Three were withdrawn in July 1927, with the last withdrawal, no. 4150 &quot;Begonia&quot;, going in April 1931.
==Prototype 4-4-0 locomotives==

The Armstrong Class were a group of four locomotives designed by William Dean and built in 1894 with driving wheels. In April 1915 no. 16 &quot;Brunel&quot; was rebuilt with wheels and piston valves, having already been fitted with a Standard No.2 boiler. It was renumbered 4169 as a member of the Flower Class. No. 14 &quot;Charles Saunders&quot; was converted in May 1917, and the remaining two were dealt with in February 1923.

<doc id="1316947" wikidata="Q4741453" url="?curid=1316947" title="Ambiguous image">
<text>Ambiguous images or reversible figures are visual forms that create ambiguity by exploiting graphical similarities and other properties of visual system interpretation between two or more distinct image forms. These are famous for inducing the phenomenon of multistable perception. Multistable perception is the occurrence of an image being able to provide multiple, although stable, perceptions.

One of the earliest examples of this type is the rabbit–duck illusion, first published in &quot;Fliegende Blätter&quot;, a German humor magazine. Other classic examples are the Rubin vase, and the &quot;My Wife and My Mother-in-Law&quot; drawing, the latter dating from a German postcard of 1888.

Ambiguous images are important to the field of psychology because they are often research tools used in experiments. There is varying evidence on whether ambiguous images can be represented mentally, but a majority of research has theorized that mental images cannot be ambiguous.

==Identifying and resolving ambiguous images==
Middle vision is the stage in visual processing that combines all the basic features in the scene into distinct, recognizable object groups. This stage of vision comes before high-level vision (understanding the scene) and after early vision (determining the basic features of an image). When perceiving and recognizing images, mid-level vision comes into use when we need to classify the object we are seeing quickly. Whether perceived or actual, Negative space will play a role here. 

Higher-level vision is used when the object classified must now be recognized as a specific member of its group. For example, through mid-level vision we perceive a face, then through high-level vision we recognize a face of a familiar person. Mid-level vision and high-level vision are crucial for understanding a reality that is filled with ambiguous perceptual inputs.

==Perceiving the image in mid-level vision==
When we see an image, the first thing we do is attempt to organize all the parts of the scene into different groups. To do this, one of the most basic methods used is finding the edges. Edges can include obvious perceptions such as the edge of a house, and can include other perceptions that the brain needs to process deeper, such as the edges of a person&#x27;s facial features. When finding edges, the brain&#x27;s visual system detects a point on the image with a sharp contrast of lighting. Being able to detect the location of the edge of an object aids in recognizing the object. In ambiguous images, detecting edges still seems natural to the person perceiving the image. However, the brain undergoes deeper processing to resolve the ambiguity. For example, consider an image that involves an opposite change in magnitude of luminance between the object and the background (e.g. From the top, the background shifts from black to white, and the object shifts from white to black). The opposing gradients will eventually come to a point where there is an equal degree of luminance of the object and the background. At this point, there is no edge to be perceived. To counter this, the visual system connects the image as a whole rather than a set of edges, allowing one to see an object rather than edges and non-edges. Although there is no complete image to be seen, the brain is able to accomplish this because of its understanding of the physical world and real incidents of ambiguous lighting.

In ambiguous images, an illusion is often produced from illusory contours. An illusory contour is a perceived contour without the presence of a physical gradient. In examples where a white shape appears to occlude black objects on a white background, the white shape appears to be brighter than the background, and the edges of this shape produce the illusory contours. These illusory contours are processed by the brain in a similar way as real contours. The visual system accomplishes this by making inferences beyond the information that is presented in much the same way as the luminance gradient.

==Gestalt grouping rules==
In mid-level vision, the visual system utilizes a set of heuristic methods, called Gestalt grouping rules, to quickly identify a basic perception of an object that helps to resolve an ambiguity. This allows perception to be fast and easy by observing patterns and familiar images rather than a slow process of identifying each part of a group. This aids in resolving ambiguous images because the visual system will accept small variations in the pattern and still perceive the pattern as a whole. The Gestalt grouping rules are the result of the experience of the visual system. Once a pattern is perceived frequently, it is stored in memory and can be perceived again easily without the requirement of examining the entire object again. For example, when looking at a chess board, we perceive a checker pattern and not a set of alternating black and white squares.

===Good continuation===
The principle of good continuation provides the visual system a basis for identifying continuing edges. This means that when a set of lines is perceived, there is a tendency for a line to continue in one direction. This allows the visual system to identify the edges of a complex image by identifying points where lines cross. For example, two lines crossed in an &quot;X&quot; shape will be perceived as two lines travelling diagonally rather than two lines changing direction to form &quot;V&quot; shapes opposite to each other. An example of an ambiguous image would be two curving lines intersecting at a point. This junction would be perceived the same way as the &quot;X&quot;, where the intersection is seen as the lines crossing rather than turning away from each other. Illusions of good continuation are often used by magicians to trick audiences.

===Similarity===
The rule of similarity states that images that are similar to each other can be grouped together as being the same type of object or part of the same object. Therefore, the more similar two images or objects are, the more likely it will be that they can be grouped together. For example, two squares among many circles will be grouped together. They can vary in similarity of colour, size, orientation and other properties, but will ultimately be grouped together with varying degrees of membership.

===Proximity, common region, and connectedness===

The grouping property of &quot;proximity (Gestalt)&quot; is the spatial distance between two objects. The closer two objects are, the more likely they belong to the same group. This perception can be ambiguous without the person perceiving it as ambiguous. For example, two objects with varying distances and orientations from the viewer may appear to be proximal to each other, while a third object may be closer to one of the other objects but appear farther.

Objects occupying a common region on the image appear to already be members of the same group. This can include unique spatial location, such as two objects occupying a distinct region of space outside of their group&#x27;s own. Objects can have close proximity but appear as though part of a distinct group through various visual aids such as a threshold of colours separating the two objects.

Additionally, objects can be visually connected in ways such as drawing a line going from each object. These similar but hierarchical rules suggest that some Gestalt rules can override other rules.

==Texture segmentation and figure-ground assignments==
The visual system can also aid itself in resolving ambiguities by detecting the pattern of texture in an image. This is accomplished by using many of the Gestalt principles. The texture can provide information that helps to distinguish whole objects, and the changing texture in an image reveals which distinct objects may be part of the same group. Texture segmentation rules often both cooperate and compete with each other, and examining the texture can yield information about the layers of the image, disambiguating the background, foreground, and the object.

===Size and surroundedness===
When a region of texture completely surrounds another region of texture, it is likely the background. Additionally, the smaller regions of texture in an image are likely the figure.

===Parallelism and symmetry===
Parallelism is another way to disambiguate the figure of an image. The orientation of the contours of different textures in an image can determine which objects are grouped together. Generally, parallel contours suggest membership to the same object or group of objects. Similarly, symmetry of the contours can also define the figure of an image.

===Extremal edges and relative motion===
An extremal edge is a change in texture that suggests an object is in front of or behind another object. This can be due to a shading effect on the edges of one region of texture, giving the appearance of depth. Some extremal edge effects can overwhelm the segmentations of surroundedness or size. The edges perceived can also aid in distinguishing objects by examining the change in texture against an edge due to motion.

====Using ambiguous images to hide in the real world: camouflage====
In nature, camouflage is used by organisms to escape predators. This is achieved through creating an ambiguity of texture segmentation by imitating the surrounding environment. Without being able to perceive noticeable differences in texture and position, a predator will be unable to see their prey.

==Occlusion==
Many ambiguous images are produced through some occlusion, wherein an object&#x27;s texture suddenly stops. An occlusion is the visual perception of one object being behind or in front of another object, providing information about the order of the layers of texture. The illusion of occlusion is apparent in the effect of illusory contours, where occlusion is perceived despite being non-existent. Here, an ambiguous image is perceived to be an instance of occlusion. When an object is occluded, the visual system only has information about the parts of the object that can be seen, so the rest of the processing must be done deeper and must involve memory.

==Accidental viewpoints==
An accidental viewpoint is a single visual position that produces an ambiguous image. The accidental viewpoint does not provide enough information to distinguish what the object is. Often, this image is perceived incorrectly and produces an illusion that differs from reality. For example, an image may be split in half, with the top half being enlarged and placed further away from the perceiver in space. This image will be perceived as one complete image from only a single viewpoint in space, rather than the reality of two separate halves of an object, creating an optical illusion. Street artists often use tricks of point-of-view to create two-dimensional scenes on the ground that appear three-dimensional.

==Recognizing an object through high-level vision==

Figures drawn in a way that avoids depth cues may become ambiguous. Classic examples of this phenomenon are the Necker cube, and the rhombille tiling (viewed as an isometric drawing of cubes).

To go further than just perceiving the object is to recognize the object. Recognizing an object plays a crucial role in resolving ambiguous images, and relies heavily on memory and prior knowledge. To recognize an object, the visual system detects familiar components of it, and compares the perceptual representation of it with a representation of the object stored in memory. This can be done using various templates of an object, such as &quot;dog&quot; to represent dogs in general. The template method is not always successful because members of a group may significantly differ visually from each other, and may look much different if viewed from different angles. To counter the problem of viewpoint, the visual system detects familiar components of an object in 3-dimensional space. If the components of an object perceived are in the same position and orientation of an object in memory, recognition is possible. Research has shown that people that are more creative in their imagery are better able to resolve ambiguous images. This may be due to their ability to quickly identify patterns in the image. When making a mental representation of an ambiguous image, in the same way as normal images, each part is defined and then put onto the mental representation. The more complex the scene is, the longer it takes to process and add to the representation.

===Using memory and recent experience===
Our memory has a large impact on resolving an ambiguous image, as it helps the visual system to identify and recognize objects without having to analyze and categorize them repeatedly. Without memory and prior knowledge, an image with several groups of similar objects will be difficult to perceive. Any object can have an ambiguous representation and can be mistakenly categorized into the wrong groups without sufficient memory recognition of an object. This finding suggests that prior experience is necessary for proper perception. Studies have been done with the use of Greebles to show the role of memory in object recognition. The act of priming the participant with an exposure to a similar visual stimulus also has a large effect on the ease of resolving an ambiguity.

==Disorders in perception==
Prosopagnosia is a disorder that causes a person to be unable to identify faces. The visual system undergoes mid-level vision and identifies a face, but high-level vision fails to identify who the face belongs to. In this case, the visual system identifies an ambiguous object, a face, but is unable to resolve the ambiguity using memory, leaving the affected unable to determine who they are seeing.

==In media==
From 1903 to 1905 Gustave Verbeek wrote his comic series &quot;The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo&quot;. These comics were made in such a way that one could read the 6-panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such comics in total. In 2012 a remake of a selection of the comics was made by Marcus Ivarsson in the book &#x27;In Uppåner med Lilla Lisen &amp; Gamle Muppen&#x27;. ()

The use of the ambiguous image phenomena can be seen in select works of M.C. Escher and Salvador Dalí. The children&#x27;s book, &quot;Round Trip&quot;, by Ann Jonas used ambiguous images in the illustrations, where the reader could read the book front to back normally at first, and then flip it upside down to continue the story and see the pictures in a new perspective.

<text>Brandon DiCamillo (born March 15, 1977) is an American former television personality. He was a founding member of the CKY crew and rose to fame through appearances in the &quot;CKY&quot; video series and MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot;, &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;, and &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; series.

==Life and career==
DiCamillo was born on March 15, 1977 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He attended West Chester East High School. He first appeared as a member of the CKY crew in the &quot;CKY&quot; video series, which he co-wrote together with Bam Margera.

He was cast with other members of the crew for the MTV reality comedy series &quot;Jackass&quot;, appearing in the television series and its films. When the series ended in 2002, DiCamillo was featured in Bam Margera&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;, which DiCamillo also co-wrote. He then starred in Margera&#x27;s &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; reality television show, which ran from 2003 to 2005. He co-starred in his own show with Rake Yohn called &quot;Blastazoid&quot;, which only lasted two episodes until MTV canceled the show due to dispute between MTV and the makers of the show. DiCamillo then appeared in Bam Margera&#x27;s &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; TV series. In 2008, he starred in Chris Raab&#x27;s short film &quot;Hotdog Casserole&quot;. In 2009, he starred in Margera&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

DiCamillo also released prank phone call recordings. In 2001, he released a collection of calls titled &quot;Otimen Recording Hell! (A.K.A. Bran&#x27;s Freestyles)&quot;. In 2010, he released four more prank call collections, under the name Gnarkall, via digital download through his own record label, Roman Sausage. Three volumes were made available, followed by a fourth volume composed of preceding content, in addition to extra prank calls.

He was the comedic voice talent and vocalist of the parody band Gnarkill, and is also known by some for his prank calls and freestyle raps, some of which can be viewed in the &quot;CKY&quot; videos, on the &quot;Volume 2&quot; CD, and on the &quot;Otimen Recording Hell&quot; CD produced by Bam Margera.

He made a cameo appearance as John Madden in Mega64&#x27;s “Madden Rap 2012&quot; YouTube video. Additionally, he has also provided voiceovers for the video game &quot;Trials HD&quot; and its sequel &quot;Trials Evolution&quot;.

In 2017, DiCamillo started the Attic Aficionados podcast with Tom Barbalet.

Bam Margera stated in a 2017 Reddit post that once &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; concluded in 2006, he and DiCamillo lost contact. However, DiCamillo and Margera did work together on &quot;Radio Bam&quot;, &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; and &quot;Minghags&quot; in the time since &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; ended. Since &quot;Minghags&quot;, DiCamillo has not appeared in any CKY-related project. It is believed he decided to move out of the public eye. This was confirmed by Joe Frantz in 2017, stating that DiCamillo formally renounced his affiliation with the CKY crew years prior in order to live a private life with his wife and children.

In June 2023, Steve-O said that DiCamillo contacted him, saying that he was interested in returning to show business.

==Personal life==
DiCamillo previously worked for Neiman-Marcus. He dislikes Hollywood work, and has said that the CKY work for MTV was sometimes &quot;too corporate&quot;.

===Gaming world record===

In September 2008, DiCamillo achieved a world record in the arcade video game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The event was held at Challenge Arcade in Berkshire Mall in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and was attended by approximately two dozen event participants, as well as Mark Alpiger (representing ClassicArcadeGaming.com) and Chief Referee Dave Nelson (representing TwinGalaxies.com). DiCamillo&#x27;s final score was 10,226,500, which beat previous record-holder David Nelson&#x27;s score of 7,691,000. In 2009, DiCamillo&#x27;s world record was beaten by Isaiah-TriForce Johnson, with a score of 24,821,500, and again on September 27, 2017, by Patrick J Maher with a score of 25,402,000. DiCamillo has dropped to sixth place as of 2023.

<text>A , ; in Neapolitan ) or pending coffee is a cup of coffee paid for in advance as an anonymous act of charity. The tradition began in the working-class cafés of Naples, where someone who had experienced good luck would order a &quot;sospeso&quot;, paying the price of two coffees but receiving and consuming only one. A poor person enquiring later whether there was a &quot;sospeso&quot; available would then be served a coffee for free. Coffee shops in other countries have adopted the sospeso to increase sales, and to promote kindness and caring.

==History==
One 2010 account claims the tradition was over 100 years old, but declined during the postwar economic boom, so that it is mainly observed around Christmas time. A 2008 article reported the tradition was obsolete, the reporter having visited three bars where it had not been observed for at least 15 years. Aurelio De Laurentiis is reported to pay for ten &quot;sospesi&quot; after each victory by S.S.C. Napoli, the football club of which he is chairman.
The &quot;sospeso&quot; gave the title to a 2008 journalism collection by Neapolitan Luciano De Crescenzo, , which helped publicise the tradition throughout Italy. The idea has been reported in cafés in Bulgaria, Ukraine, Australia, Canada, Romania, Russia, Spain, Argentina, the United States, and Costa Rica. The idea received a revival in Italy in 2011 with several small Italian festivals forming a Suspended Coffee Network to encourage solidarity in response to cultural budget cuts, and a Dutch campaign at Christmas 2011 gave a discount on the price of the donated coffee. In December 2011, Neapolitan authorities declared an annual &quot;Suspended Coffee Day&quot;.

In March 2013, John Sweeney launched a Facebook page for &quot;Suspended Coffees&quot;, which by 2015 had led to the purchase of over 15 million coffees in 34 countries.

The UK arm of coffee chain Starbucks signed up for a charity initiative based on the suspended coffee concept in April 2013, in which it said it would match the value of each suspended coffee with a cash donation to the Oasis charity. The growth of the trend in other coffee shops in the UK also received media coverage around the same time.

On 22 July 2013, a Tuesday, an anonymous customer in Edmonton, Canada, paid for 500 large coffees at Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons. This started a trend that spread to a total of 30 locations with over 10,000 cups of coffee being paid for by donors.

On 10 September 2021, a Friday, an anonymous customer in Istanbul, Turkey, paid for 501 Turkish coffees at Turkish food chain Dönerci Metin Usta, the largest suspended coffee donation ever recorded in 100 years.

There are accounts of the practice reviving in southern Italy, and not just for coffee, as a response to economic hardship caused by the 2020 COVID-19 lock-down.

==Symbolism==
The &quot;caffè sospeso&quot; has been identified as a symbol of grassroots social solidarity, prompting its revival in response to the 2008 recession and ensuing eurozone crisis. In 2004, a &quot;giornata nazionale del sospeso&quot; at Easter was announced by the &quot;Ronde della carità&quot; charity. In 2011, a &quot;Giornata del Caffè Sospeso&quot; was scheduled to coincide with Human Rights Day in December. A collection of Italian arts festivals emphasising social solidarity in 2010 came together under the umbrella &quot;Rete del Caffè Sospeso&quot;. An Italian fundraising website started by Luca Argentero is called 1caffe.org.

<text>The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), commonly known as the State Grid, is a Chinese state-owned electric utility corporation. It is the largest utility company in the world. , State Grid is the world&#x27;s third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Amazon. In 2023 it was reported as having 1.3 million employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$546 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC).

After the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation () were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.

==History==
State Grid is one of the &quot;core&quot; central state-owned enterprises (SOE) overseen by SASAC. The company is a pioneer in developing clean energy technology.

China began an initiative to reform the country&#x27;s power sector in a three-stage process in 1986. In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country&#x27;s electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions. The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies. The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company. SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%. At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.

In 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005. The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.

The State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China&#x27;s electrical grid planned for 2011–2015. China&#x27;s smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi–Xuzhou to Yaan–southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.

On October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission. In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

In 2015, SGCC proposed the Global Energy Interconnection, a long-term proposal to develop globally integrated smart grids and ultra high voltage transmission networks to connect over 80 countries. The idea is supported by President Xi Jinping and China in attempting to develop support in various internal forums, including UN bodies.

As of 2024, SGCC is the world&#x27;s largest energy utility company. SGCC is the third biggest company in the world (as measured by revenues) in the 2023 Fortune Global 500. It operates almost all of China&#x27;s energy transmission network.

==Overseas investments==
By 2019, State Grid had ten overseas offices and agreements with partners in the United States, Germany, and with international non-governmental organizations for projects including developing new smart grid technology.

As of 2021, State Grid had part ownership of, or operated, electricity assets in Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Austra, Greece, Australia, Georgia, Oman, and the Philippines. It had built or upgraded electricity assets in more than 30 Asian, African, and Latin American countries. State Grid had also exported more equipment to more than 70 countries.

===Philippines===
On December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid—privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia&#x27;s TNB Prai Sdn Bhd. This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).

On February 28, 2008, TransCo&#x27;s concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang. In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country&#x27;s power grid in December 2008.

On January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, management, construction, expansion, and eminent domain of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized and turned them over from the Philippine government to the private sector after 72 years and 2 months since the establishment of another government-owned corporation serving as TransCo&#x27;s predecessor in power grid operations, management, and ownership National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR/NPC) that operated, maintained, and owned the grid from November 3, 1936 to March 1, 2003. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.

===Other countries===
In Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012–2014).

In Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.

In Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities. State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017. State Grid built the 2000 km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

In Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energía, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020. On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compañia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.

In Italy, State Grid owns 35% stake in CDP Reti, which owns a third of Italy&#x27;s power and gas grid operators Terna and Snam.

<text>or is one of the longest rivers in Trøndelag county, in the central part of Norway. The long river flows through the municipalities of Røyrvik, Namsskogan, Grong, Overhalla, and Namsos before emptying into the Namsenfjorden. The river is the namesake for the whole Namdalen region. The river traditionally has been used for floating timber down from the forests to the town of Namsos, where the sawmills were located. Today, parts of the Namsen are regulated by several dams.

==Location==

The river begins in springs in Børgefjell National Park, just over the border in Nordland county. This water feeds the large lake Namsvatnet. The Namsen river itself starts when the water passes through the dam on the northwest side of the lake Namsvatnet in Røyrvik Municipality.

The river then travels through the Namdalen valley towards the coast, ending at the town of Namsos where it flows into the Namsenfjorden, the same fjord into which the smaller river Årgårdselva flows. There are two major tributaries to the Namsen: Tunnsjøelva and Sanddøla.

The total watershed is approximately and at Namsos, the water discharges into the fjord at about .

==Fishing==
The Namsen is considered one of the best Atlantic Salmon fishing rivers in the world, and is often called the &quot;Queen of Rivers&quot;. Beginning in the 19th century, the British found the Atlantic salmon fishing to be excellent here, and the river became a major tourist attraction. Catches above are not unusual. The Namsen is a wide river and is thus often fished from small boats using a method called &quot;harling&quot;. This method consists of trolling a lure while the boat moves slowly from bank to bank and drifting downstream. Thus, the salmon meet the lure as they swim upstream.

<text>April Margera (born March 28, 1956) is an American reality television personality who has appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; and &quot;Jackass&quot;, as well as the &quot;CKY&quot; videos, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Minghags&quot; and &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot;.

==Biography==
April Margera is married to Phil Margera and together they are the parents of skateboarder and &quot;Jackass&quot; star Bam Margera and CKY drummer Jess Margera. Jeff Tremaine, producer of &quot;Jackass&quot;, once referred to her as &quot;everyone&#x27;s mom&quot;, telling how she cooked dinner for the entire &quot;Jackass&quot; crew on their first trip to West Chester, Pennsylvania. She is a trained hairdresser.

In 2006, she published a cookbook called &quot;April Cooks: There&#x27;s an Alligator in My Kitchen&quot;, which is a play on the fact that Bam put an alligator in her kitchen as part of a skit on &quot;&quot; (he was trying to make her swear because the movie would be uncensored). This was achieved in the film and in &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;. In October 2007, she testified on behalf of the defense for her brother-in-law Vincent Margera&#x27;s trial.

In December 2011, it was announced that Margera had opened The Rose Hip Barn, along with her mother Velma and her daughter-in-law Kelly. The store, located in Thornton, Pennsylvania, sells refurbished furniture as well as homemade purses and accessories for the home.

In March 2016, April and Bam Margera appeared on the VH1 reality television show &quot;Family Therapy with Dr. Jenn&quot; to work on their relationship and confront Bam&#x27;s alcoholism.

<text>The Arecibo message is an interstellar radio message carrying basic information about humanity and Earth that was sent to the globular cluster Messier 13 in 1974. It was meant as a demonstration of human technological achievement, rather than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials.

The message was broadcast into space a single time via frequency modulated radio waves at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico on 16 November 1974. The message was aimed at the current location of M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth, because M13 was a large and relatively close collection of stars that was available in the sky at the time and place of the ceremony. When correctly translated into graphics, characters, and spaces, the 1,679 bits of data contained within the message form the image shown here.

==Description==
The content of the Arecibo message was designed by a group of Cornell University and Arecibo scientists: Frank Drake, creator of the Drake equation, Richard Isaacman, Linda May, and James C.G. Walker. Carl Sagan and others also contributed. The message was meant more as a demonstration of human technological achievement than a serious attempt to enter into a conversation with possible extraterrestrials. As globular cluster M13, at which the message was aimed, is more than 25,000 light-years from Earth, the message, traveling at the speed of light, will take at least 25,000 years to arrive there. By that time, the core of M13 will no longer be in precisely the same location because of the orbit of the star cluster around the Galactic Center. Even so, the proper motion of M13 is small, so the message will still arrive near the center of the cluster.

The message consists of seven parts that encode the following (from the top down in the image):
*The numbers one to ten (white; left to right)
*The atomic numbers of the elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, which make up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (purple)
*The formulas for the chemical compounds that make up the nucleotides of DNA (green)
*The estimated number of DNA nucleotides in the human genome, and a graphic of the double helix structure of DNA (white and blue, respectively)
*The dimension (physical height, 5&#x27;9&quot;) of an average man (blue/white), a graphic figure of a human being (red), and the human population of Earth which was about 4 billion at the time (white)
*A graphic of the Solar System (including Pluto), indicating which of the planets the message is coming from (yellow). The Sun is on the left and the third planet, Earth, raised toward the human figure
*A graphic of the Arecibo radio telescope and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dish (purple, white, and blue)

The entire message consisted of 1,679 binary digits, approximately 210 bytes, transmitted at a frequency of 2,380 MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz, with a power of 450 kW. The &quot;ones&quot; and &quot;zeros&quot; were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.

The number 1,679 was chosen because it is a semiprime (the product of two prime numbers), to be arranged rectangularly as 73 rows by 23 columns. The alternative arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, produces an unintelligible set of characters.

===Message as binary string===
The message as a binary string is included below. Note that the choice of 1 representing higher frequency and 0 representing lower frequency is entirely arbitrary and the line breaks after every 23 bits are only included to allow for some ease in human readability.


===Numbers===
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 00 00 00
 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 00 00 10
 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 01 11 01
 X X X X X X X X X X &lt;-Least-significant-digit marker.

The numbers from 1 to 10 appear in binary format, to be read from the top down. The bottom row contains markers which indicate the column from which the binary code for each number is intended to begin.

Even assuming that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious because of the way they have been written. To read the first seven digits, ignore the bottom row, and read them as three binary digits from top to bottom, with the top digit being the most significant. The readings for 8, 9, and 10 are a little different, as their binary code has been distributed across an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image). This is intended to show that numbers too large to fit in a single column can be written in several contiguous ones (a scheme which is used elsewhere in the message). The additional columns are not marked by the least-significant-digit marker.

=== DNA elements ===
 H C N O P
 1 6 7 8 15
 0 0 0 1 1
 0 1 1 0 1
 0 1 1 0 1
 1 0 1 0 1
 X X X X X

The numbers 1, 6, 7, 8, and 15 appear, denoting the atomic numbers of hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and phosphorus (P), the elements from which DNA is composed.

===Nucleotides===

The chemical groups from which the nucleotides of polymeric DNA sequences are built – the sugar deoxyribose, phosphate, and the four canonical nucleobases used in DNA – are then described as sequences of the five elements that appear on the preceding line. Each sequence represents the molecular formula of the chemical as it exists when incorporated into DNA (as opposed to the free form).

For example, the compound in the top left in the image is deoxyribose (C5H7O in DNA, C5H10O4 when free), whose formula is read as:

 11000
 10000
 11010
 XXXXX
 75010

i.e., 7 atoms of hydrogen, 5 atoms of carbon, 0 atoms of nitrogen, 1 atom of oxygen, and 0 atoms of phosphorus.

It is displayed in this order because the DNA Elements in the previous section (Purple image as reference) describe hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and phosphorus (P) in that order as well.

 = 4,294,441,822 (decimal)

A graphic of the approximate shape of the double helix in which double-stranded DNA polymers naturally exist; the vertical bar in the middle is a binary representation of the number of nucleotide base pairs in the human genome. The value depicted is around 4.3 billion, which was believed to be the case when the message was transmitted in 1974; it is now known that there are only approximately 3.2 billion base pairs in the human genome.

===Humanity===

The graphic in the center is a simple illustration of a human being. The element on the left (in the image) indicates the average height of an adult male in the US: . This value is indicated by a horizontally written binary representation of the number 14, which is intended to be multiplied by the wavelength of the message (126 mm); 14 × 126 = 1,764 millimeters.

The element on the right of the image indicates the size of the global human population in 1974, approximately 4.3 billion (which, coincidentally, is within 0.1% of the number of DNA base pairs suggested for the size of the human genome earlier in the message). In this case, the number is oriented in the data horizontally rather than vertically. The least-significant-digit marker is in the upper left in the image, with bits going to the right and more significant digits below.

===Planets===


A graphic depicting the Solar System, showing the Sun and nine planets in the order of their distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto (Pluto was reclassified in 2006 as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union). Earth is the third planet from the Sun; its graphic is shifted up to identify it as the planet from which the signal was sent. Additionally, the human figure is shown just above the Earth graphic.

In addition to showing position, the graphic provides a general, not-to-scale size reference of each planet and the Sun.

===Telescope===


The last part is a graphic representing the Arecibo radio telescope and indicating its diameter with a binary representation of the number 2,430; multiplying by the wavelength of 126 mm gives . In this case, the number is oriented horizontally, with the least-significant-digit marker to the lower right in the image.

The part of the image that resembles a letter &quot;M&quot; is there to demonstrate that the curved line is a concave curved mirror.

== Arecibo Answer crop circle hoax ==


The &quot;Hampshire pattern&quot; or &quot;Chilbolton Code formation&quot; or &quot;Arecibo answer&quot; was a crop circle that appeared in 2001 near the Chilbolton radio telescope in Hampshire, UK, which echoed the visual representation and most of the information from the original Arecibo message with some significant differences including location/origin, DNA configuration, and appearance. 

The SETI Institute Online rebutted the idea that this was a genuine extraterrestrial response, by saying, &quot;This is highly improbable. There is no evidence to suggest an other-than-earthly origin for these graphics.&quot; The crop circle is a near replica of the Arecibo message, with the same 23 × 73 grid. Most of the chemical data remains the same, with the exception that in the section detailing important chemical elements, silicon has been added, and the diagram of DNA has been rewritten. At the bottom, the pictogram of a human is replaced with a figure with a large, bulbous head. A solar system with 9 planets is also depicted, with emphasis placed on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th planets of the system. The Arecibo telescope is replaced by a replica of a crop circle that appeared in the same field one year before, and the binary representation of the transmitter&#x27;s diameter is altered.

<doc id="1317006" wikidata="Q12061363" url="?curid=1317006" title="London Underground R Stock">
<text>The London Underground R Stock electric multiple units were used on London Underground&#x27;s District line from 1949 to 1983. Composed of new cars and converted Q38 Stock trailers, the cars were built and converted in three batches between 1949 and 1959. The cars were driving motors (DM) or non-driving motors (NDM), there being no unpowered trailers. The second batch, introduced in 1952, was constructed from aluminium, saving weight and one train was left unpainted as an experiment. Considered a success, trains were left unpainted or painted white or grey to match in 1963–68. Originally designed to operate in trains with six off-peak and eight cars during peak hours, the trains were reformed as fixed seven-car trains in 1971. R Stock trains were replaced by the D78 Stock and withdrawn between 1981 and 1983.

==Construction==

After World War II it was decided to replace the London Underground trains that remained with hand-operated sliding doors. R Stock was ordered to replace such trains on the District line and the LPTB considered 200 cars were needed, but due to the shortages of labour and materials following the war only 143 new cars were authorised. Some Q stock trailers that had been built in 1938 were converted into R Stock driving motor (DM) cars. The new cars were designated R47 and built by Birmingham RC&amp;W and Gloucester RC&amp;W and the 82 Q Stock trailers converted by Gloucester RC&amp;W from Q38 trailer were designated R38/1. The first car arrived in 1949 and entered service in 1950.

A second batch was ordered to allow the F Stock to be transferred to Metropolitan line and so allow the Circle Stock to be withdrawn. The 90 new R49 cars were constructed from aluminium and built by Metro Cammell, reducing the weight of a train by . An eight car train from this batch was unpainted as an experiment. A third batch of 20 R59 cars, 13 new, was built to allow the transfer of Q stock trailers to increase the length of Circle line trains to six cars.

==Description==
Although visually similar to the R Stock trains there were some differences from the O, P and Q Stock trains. These included external &#x27;door open&#x27; indicator lights, roller destination blinds, fluorescent lighting and a modified way of displaying the internal advertisements and District line route maps. One of the most noticeable differences between the R38 Stock and the rest of the R Stock fleet was that the R38 cars featured four small windows in the central saloon between the double doors, whereas the R47, R49, and R59 cars featured just two larger windows in the same location. All R Stock cars seated 40 passengers, however whilst the R38 cars featured two sets of transverse seats in the centre bay, the rest of the fleet featured just one set of transverse seats, and more longitudinal seating.

==History==

Cars were formed into semi-permanent units and when first placed in service, these were either four-car units with the cab at the west end (DM-NDM-NDM-NDM) or two-car units with the cab at the east end (NDM-DM). For off-peak service, one unit of each type was coupled together to form a six-car train, whilst at peak times, several such trains would be lengthened to eight cars by the addition of a second two-car unit. A maximum of 36 eight-car trains could be formed, with the remaining 15 running as six-car. Initially the R Stock trains were painted red, to match the O, P and Q Stock trains, but one eight-car train of R49 stock was left unpainted, as an experiment. The R59 stock was also unpainted; the R38/3 stock that was converted to run with it was painted silver-grey to match. Since the trains were regularly reformed between 6 and 8 car lengths it became usual to see trains of mixed red and silver formation, so in 1963–68 all the red R Stock trains were repainted white to match the unpainted aluminium cars.

The coupling between two units was of the Wedglock type, and one of these was fitted at the eastern end of all units and at the western ends of the two-car units. Coupling of two units was automatically achieved by driving the two together. To uncouple two units, an uncoupling control was operated in one of the cars adjacent to the coupler. Two-car units had this in the driving cab, but four-car units, having no cab at the eastern end, were provided with a key-operated control on the outside of the car end. The four-car units had a Ward coupler at the western end, because this end would not normally need to couple. In both types of unit, there was a bar coupling between cars, which could only be uncoupled in a workshop.

In 1962/63 one train of R stock featured in early trials of automatically driven trains, prior to the larger scale trials on the Central Line which preceded the use on the Victoria line. These trials involved the one eastbound District Line train travelling in automatic mode between Stamford Brook and Ravenscourt Park stations. In 1971 it was decided to abandon the practice running trains with six cars off-peak and eight cars during the peak; instead all District line trains would be seven cars in length. 36 of the four-car units were reduced to three cars; these units would in future always be coupled to two two-car units to form a seven car train. The remaining 15 four-car units were lengthened to five cars by adding one of the released cars; these units would work with a single two-car unit. This left 21 cars (all of R47 type) spare that were sent for scrap.

==Withdrawal and preservation==
Twenty-one cars were withdrawn between October 1971 and February 1972 as a result of the reformation into 7-car trains and others were withdrawn between 1971 and 1982 due to fire damage. General withdrawal began in March 1981 and was completed in March 1983. The Athens-Piraeus Electric Railways showed interest in purchasing 60 cars of R stock, for use in five-car trains, since the dimensions of that system were similar to the District Line, but the deal fell through.

They were replaced by the new D78 Stock, except on the Edgware Road-Wimbledon route, where shorter platforms necessitated the use of C Stock.

Three vehicles have been preserved.

<doc id="1317015" wikidata="Q3613184" url="?curid=1317015" title="Grand Ducal Highness">
<text>His or Her Grand Ducal Highness (abbreviation: HGDH) is a style of address used by the non-reigning members of some German ruling families headed by a Grand Duke. No currently reigning family employs the style, although it was used most recently by the younger sisters of the late Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. Since Grand Duchess Charlotte&#x27;s marriage to Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, all of their male-line descendants have used the style Royal Highness, which he bore.

A reigning grand duke, his heir apparent, and their spouses would use the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. The male line descendants of a reigning grand duke, other than the heir, would use the style &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot;. This practice was followed by the ruling families of Luxembourg, Hesse and by Rhine, and Baden. Other grand ducal families had either ceased to reign as grand dukes by the time this system developed following the 1815 Congress of Vienna or accorded only the style of &quot;Highness&quot; to cadet (Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar). At present, the style is used only by the former ruling family of Baden, as the Hessian grand ducal family has become extinct.

Russian grand dukes and grand duchesses were the children or grandchildren of an Emperor of Russia and used the style &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;. The Grand Dukes of Tuscany used the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; for themselves but it is not clear what style other members of the family would have used. By the time the system of different classes of &quot;Highness&quot; came into regular use for the relatives of rulers (in the eighteenth century), the Tuscan grand dukes were also members of the House of Austria. As such, they had the title of Archduke and used the style &quot;Imperial and Royal Highness&quot;.
In most of Europe, the style of &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot; was of lower rank than &quot;Imperial Highness&quot; and &quot;Royal Highness&quot; but higher than &quot;Highness&quot; and &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. If a woman with the rank of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; married a man with the rank &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot;, the woman would usually retain her pre-marital style. Also, if a woman with the rank of &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot; married a man with the rank of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, she would keep her pre-marital style. However, if a woman bearing the style &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot; married a man bearing the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; or &quot;Imperial Highness&quot; she would, being consistent with the established tradition of conferring styles, assume her husband&#x27;s style of &quot;Imperial Highness&quot; or &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Similarly, if a woman bearing a lower (or no) title married a man bearing the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; or &quot;Highness&quot;, she would assume her husband&#x27;s style. Cadets of grand ducal families who bore only the style of &quot;Highness&quot; were not, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, deemed of lesser rank than cadets of grand ducal families entitled to the style of &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot;.

<doc id="1317016" wikidata="Q4638400" url="?curid=1317016" title="46th Street station (Metro Transit)">
<text>46th Street station is a light rail station on the Metro Blue Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This station is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of 46th Street and Minnesota State Highway 55 (Hiawatha Avenue), in the Ericsson neighborhood. This is a side-platform station. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

46th Street Station is one of the main bus interchanges on the Blue Line in Minneapolis. Buses serving south Minneapolis and Saint Paul serve the station&#x27;s bus interchange. A bus rapid transit line, called the A Line, began operating on Snelling Avenue in June 2016, beginning its route at 46th Street station; the line also connects to the Green Line at Snelling Avenue and University Avenue.

Buses enter and exit the station underneath Oak Station Place, a four-story apartment building. A two-story skyway allows traffic such as buses and cars to enter and exit. The building opened in 2012. Between 2019 and 2024, six apartment buildings were built within a that offered a total of 500 units. The area is one of the few places on the Blue Line outside of downtown that has seen significant development of housing.

== Services ==
From 46th Street station there are direct bus connections to the A Line and routes 7, 9, 46 and 74, and Minnesota Valley Transit Authority routes 436 and 446. HOURCAR, a local carsharing program, has a solar-powered charging station at 46th Street for the organization&#x27;s fleet of plug-in Toyota Priuses. The Hiawatha LRT Trail, which runs along much of the METRO Blue Line route, provides connection for bicyclists to reach East Minnehaha Parkway and Minnehaha Park.

== Art==
There are several art displays at the station including a turtle on the southbound station shelter which was added to reference the nearby Minnehaha Creek.

<text>[[Trade]] can be a key factor in [[economic development]]. The prudent use of trade can boost a country&#x27;s development and create absolute gains for the trading partners involved. Trade has been touted as an important tool in the path to development by prominent economists. However trade may not be a panacea for development as important questions surrounding how free trade really is and the harm trade can cause domestic infant industries to come into play.

==Importance==
The current consensus is that trade, development, and poverty reduction are intimately linked. Sustained economic growth over longer periods is associated with poverty reduction, while trade and growth are linked. Countries that develop invariably increase their integration with the global economy. while export-led growth has been , 

Continents, countries and sectors that have not developed and remain largely poor have comparative advantage in three main areas:

* natural resource exploitation, i.e. running down of natural capital such as rain forest timber;
* low-education labor-intensive manufacturing, due to high population densities and little suitable land per person;
* agriculture, due to low population densities and relatively large areas of suitable land per person.

Crucially for poverty reduction, the latter two at least are labor-intensive, helping to ensure that growth in these sectors will be poverty-reducing. However, low value-added, price instability and sustainability in these commodity sectors means they should be used only temporarily and as stepping stones in the path to economic development.

== Digital trade ==

=== Digital Trade for Development 2023 Report ===
In 2023, the &quot;Digital Trade for Development&quot; report by the IMF, OECD, UNCTAD, The World Bank, and the WTO detailed the influence of digital trade on developing economies. It highlighted the necessity of international cooperation to maximize digital trade benefits and tackle associated challenges.

Key statistics from the report include:

* Digitally delivered services have grown nearly fourfold since 2005, with an annual growth rate of 8.1% from 2005 to 2022, accounting for 54% of total services exports by 2022.
* Less developed regions like Africa hold less than 1% of the global share of digitally delivered services exports.
* About 67% of the global population, or 5.4 billion people, were online in 2022, but 2.6 billion remain offline, mostly in lower-income countries.
* Aid for Trade commitments to the ICT sector were around US$ 2.16 billion for 2021-22.
* By the end of 2022, 116 regional trade agreements included digital trade provisions, representing 33% of all such agreements.

==Agriculture==
In many developing countries, agriculture employs a large proportion of the labor force, while food consumption accounts for a large share of household income. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) notes that this means that “even small changes in agricultural employment opportunities, or prices, can have major socio-economic effects in developing countries”. Thus whatever the development strategy a particular country adopts, the role of agriculture will often be crucial. In 1994, the agricultural sector employed over 70% of the labor force in low-income countries, 30% in middle-income countries, and only 4% in high-income countries (UNCTAD 1999).

In poor countries with low population densities and enough suitable land area, which includes most countries in Africa and Latin America, agriculture is central to the economy. In poor regions and rural areas within middle-income developing countries, the concentration of poverty in rural areas of otherwise better-off developing countries makes the development of agriculture vital there. Finally, in Net Food Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs), there is a positive link between growing agricultural exports and increases in local food production, which makes agricultural development if anything even more important, as food security and the financial stability of the government are also at stake. In Vietnam in the 1990s, increases in production and export of coffee of 15% a year contributed to a nearly 50% rise in food production in the same period. As agricultural GDP grew 4.6% per year, rural poverty fell from 66% in 1993 to 45% in 1998 (Global Economic Prospects 2002:40).

Anderson et al. (1999) estimate annual welfare losses of $19.8 billion for developing countries from agricultural tariffs – even after Uruguay Round reforms. This is three times the loss from OECD import restrictions on textiles and clothing. A combination of better market access, and domestic reforms and foreign aid to enhance the ability of developing countries to take advantage of it, could have a significant impact on poverty reduction, and help to meet the Millennium Development Goals.

The largest beneficiaries of agricultural liberalization would be OECD countries themselves: welfare losses of $62.9bn a year are estimated as resulting from the distortionary policies (Binswanger and Ernst 1999:5). Nor is the traditional objective of OECD agricultural subsidy (supporting small farmers) achieved by this system in a manner that could be characterised as efficient: most of the producer support incomes goes to better-off farmers, with the poorest 40% receiving just 8% of the support spent.

==Market access==

===Market access to developed countries===
The issue of market access to high-income countries is a thorny but crucial one. The issues fall into three main groups: first, those relating to deliberately imposed barriers to trade, such as tariffs, quotas, and tariff escalation. Second, barriers to trade resulting from domestic and external producer support, primarily in the form of subsidies, but also including, for example, export credits. Third, those relating to indirect barriers to trade resulting from developing countries’ lack of institutional capacity to engage in the global economy and in multilateral institutions (e.g., the World Trade Organization) on equal terms.

====Barriers to trade====
* High tariffs are imposed on agriculture: in high-income countries, the average tariff rate on agriculture is almost double the tariff for manufactures. And more than one third of the European Union&#x27;s agricultural tariff lines, for instance, carry duties above 15% . Tariff peaks within agriculture occur most frequently on processed products and temperate commodities, rather than the major export crops of least developed countries (unprocessed fruits and vegetables and tropical commodities). However, many developing countries in temperate zones have the potential of competing as lower-cost producers in temperate commodities. Thus liberalization could open up new development-through-trade possibilities.
* Strong tariff escalation is typically imposed on agricultural and food products by high-income countries. This strongly discourages the development of high value added exports, and hinders diversification in particular as well as development in general. In high-income countries, tariffs on agricultural products escalate steeply, especially in the EU and Japan. (&#x27;Tariff escalation&#x27; is the imposition of higher import tariffs on processed products than the tariffs applied to unprocessed ingredients. )
* Complex tariffs make it more difficult for developing country exporters to access industrialised-country markets because of the disadvantages developing countries face in accessing, and in their capacity to process, information. Not only are price signals distorted, they are often unclear, subject to change (for example seasonally) and difficult to interpret. 
* Tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), introduced by the Uruguay Round with the aim of securing a minimum level of market access, have performed poorly. Average fill rates have been low and declining, from 67% in 1995 to 63% in 1998, with about a quarter of TRQs filled to less than 20%. The low fill rate may reflect high in-quota rates. Overall, the UR tariffication process which produced them has not resulted in the increased market access developing countries hoped for.

====Producer support====
* Support to agricultural producers remains sizable, at about five times the level of international development assistance - $245 billion in 2000. Total support to agriculture, as defined by the OECD, reaches $327 billion - 1.3% of OECD countries’ GDP. To some extent these can be justified by “multifunctionality” arguments, but it remains a priority to find means of support which effectively meet the primary objectives without the negative developmental and environmental consequences that have been seen in the past.
* The dumping of unwanted production surpluses onto the world market through export subsidies has depressed prices for many temperate agricultural commodities, with EU surpluses of exportable wheat a prime example. (Despite several Common Agricultural Policy reforms, domestic support for wheat - as measured by OECD producer support estimates - declined only marginally from an average 52% of gross farm receipts in 1986-88, to around 48% in 1998-2000. ) The URAA has been relatively unsuccessful in disciplining export subsidies, with the proportion of subsidised exports in total exports increasing in many products of export interest for developing countries: for example for wheat, from 7% in 1995 to 25% in 1998. The cost to developing country production and exports is considerable, and only partially offset by the lower food prices available to NFIDC consumers. This form of transfer from high-income country taxpayers to low-income consumers is in any case rather inefficient, and the lower prices may harm production for local consumption even in NFIDCs. Agricultural reform as a whole, including the removal of export subsidies, would only result in quite small price rises for developing-country consumers.
*The counter-cyclical nature of producer support is also harmful to developing-country producers. High-income farmers are insulated from changes in world prices, making production less responsive to swings in demand. As a result, world commodity prices are more volatile, and the burden of adjustment falls disproportionately on developing-country producers.

====Lack of capacity====
This includes non-tariff barriers such as food regulations and standards, which developing countries are often not (or not effectively) involved in setting, and which may be deliberately used to reduce competition from developing countries. In any case, the lack of capacity to meet implement regulations and ensure compliance with standards constitutes a barrier to trade, and must be met by increasing that capacity.

Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified many capacity related issues that developing economies face aside from tariff barriers:
# Traders and potential traders must know about an agreement and its details, however, the interests and skills of good producers lie in production and not in legal rules, only the largest firms can afford policy advisers.
# Markets and suppliers must share information - producer associations, industrial organisations, and chambers of commerce exchange information among their members and this information exchange must then take place across borders (as seen between Brazil and Argentina after Mercosur).
# A successful agreement must be flexible and governments need to accept that it will need to evolve.
# Trade agreements must generate relevant reforms in areas such as customs documentation, but also more fundamentally in relaxing rules for cross-border transportation.
# Selling to new markets requires adequate finance.
# Poor or wrong infrastructure can restrict trade
# Governments can support producers or traders in other ways.
The benefits of trade agreements for developing countries are not automatic, especially for SMEs whether or not they are already exporting as the costs of entering a new market are greater for them than for large companies when compared to their potential revenue.

===Market access to developing countries===
* Average applied tariffs in agriculture are higher in developing countries (although most of the very high rates, over 100%, are found in developed countries). With an increasing share of agricultural exports directed toward other developing countries, high levels of tariff protection in the South may impede prospects for export-led growth. This may be particularly true for the export opportunities of low-income countries, which have increased export market share in agriculture .
* &quot;Open regionalism&quot; holds the potential to stimulate global trade and improve the efficiency of regional producers. But regional arrangements can also become a vehicle for protection, trade diversion, and unintended inefficiency. Agreements in particular between richer and poorer developing countries risk generating trade losses for the poorer ones when their imports are diverted toward the richer members whose firms are not internationally competitive. However, where regional arrangements lead to the reduction of non-tariff barriers, trade creation is likely, and the dynamic benefits of effective regional integration in terms of improved governance and regional stability are likely to outweigh diversion concerns. The World Bank suggests that key conditions to benefit from expanded trade and investment include lowering common external trade barriers, stimulating competition, reducing transaction costs, and reinforcing nondiscriminatory investment and services policies. The greater structural differences between North and South economies mean that North-South arrangements hold the greatest promise for economic convergence and trade creation, including in agricultural products, underlining the importance of links between South-South arrangements and northern economies.
* Trade liberalization. According to the World Bank, “most analyses suggest that unilateral reduction in barriers can produce the greatest and the quickest gains.” Some countries, such as Chile, China and Costa Rica, have undertaken domestic policy reforms. Caution must however be employed: as the case of Haiti shows, liberalization when institutions and the economy are not strong enough to face risks and opportunities can be harmful (Rodrik 2001). And while reforms may be beneficial in the long run, for example by reducing possibilities for customs corruption, in the short run they create both winners and losers. Low-income consumers, unskilled workers in sheltered industries, and previously shielded producers may suffer in the transition period as the economy adapts to changed incentive structures. Temporary safety nets can help cushion the blow and ensure trade-led growth is pro-poor. Specific assistance to meet costs of adaptation – for example of switching to a different crop – may be appropriate.

==Market access is vital, but not enough==
It is important to recognise that the issues facing LDCs and middle-income developing countries differ significantly. For the middle-income countries, the primary issue is market access. Many of the world’s poor live in these countries, and so market access alone can have significant poverty-reducing effects in these countries. However, for the least developed countries, the principal problem is not market access, but lack of production capacity to achieve new trading opportunities. This is recognised by paragraph 42 of the Doha Development Agenda:

So while the further development of middle-income countries, and in particular the tackling of rural poverty in these countries, can be achieved most importantly through increased market access in agriculture, lower-income countries need additional help, not only to take advantage of new opportunities, but to be able to adapt to changing conditions due to the loss of preferences. This additional help must take three main forms: support for developing-country agricultural production; support for participation in trade; and support for good policies and good governance.

===Support for agricultural production===
*Support for agricultural modernization and development – investment in productive capacity in agriculture and food processing.
*Support for agricultural-related development institutions which are not trade-distorting, e.g. research; e.g. risk-management of agricultural product price fluctuations; e.g. diversification.

===Support for participation in trade and the global economy===
Cases such as Haiti’s post-1986 liberalization show that the opportunities thereby created will not be taken advantage of if macroeconomic policies, institutions, and the investment climate are not favorable. This includes

*trade-related infrastructure: the cost of exporting must be low enough to ensure competitiveness in rapidly expanding high-value agricultural markets where competition is stiff – such as fruits and vegetables.
*It also includes related issues that are part of the general investment climate but can be particularly important for exports, such as a weak financial sector. Here, export finance “is often a major constraint inhibiting exports in many low-income countries.”
*Other issues are more specific to exports: developing countries and their exporters may have difficulty with both the implementation of, and showing compliance with, international product standards and other multilateral agreements. Low-income developing countries need both technical and financial assistance in this area.
*Technical Assistance for negotiations is also needed to further developing-country interests in multilateral and bilateral arenas and ensure the success of future negotiations and agreements.
*Marketing of exports is also a challenge for low-income countries: product and country brands need to be built, and quality concerns met.
Given the importance of agriculture for poverty reduction, additional policies and institutional capacity are needed to ensure an effective supply response to market incentives provide by better market access. Rural infrastructure is particularly important in enabling agricultural exports in developing countries. Sufficient credit at competitive conditions is important for private sector investment in storage, transportation and marketing of agricultural products. Investment in skills and education in rural areas is needed to bolster agricultural productivity. Trade policy reforms must address any remaining anti-export bias. Efficient land policies and land tenure institutions are needed to ensure the functioning of land markets, property rights, and efficient farm structures.

==World Trade Organization negotiations==
The most recent round of World Trade Organization negotiations (the Doha &quot;Development&quot; Round) was promoted as being directed at the interests of developing countries, addressing issues of developed country protectionism. The introduction of the (investment-related) Singapore issues together with a lack of sufficient concessions to developing countries&#x27; interests has put the success of the negotiations in doubt.

<text>The G Stock were 50 electric multiple unit train carriages built for the District Railway in 1923 by Gloucester RC&amp;W. They operated on the District line of the London Underground until 1971 (with most cars being withdrawn in the early 1960s).

==Construction==
The G Stock was built to allow the scrapping of some of wooden-built B Stock trailer cars which were in poor condition. Some steel-framed B Stock motor cars were converted to trailers, themselves being replaced by new G Stock motorcars. The G Stock consisted entirely of motor cars, all built with a clerestory roof similar in style to the B Stock with which they would work.

==Q Stock==
In 1938, forty-eight of these cars were rebuilt when the District line was standardising its post-1923 stock and were reclassified as Q23 Stock. A major part of the Q Stock project was the replacement of the potentially dangerous manually operated sliding doors (which could be opened by passengers between stations) with air operated doors controlled by the guard.

==South Acton shuttle==
The two remaining cars were rebuilt into single cars for use on the South Acton shuttle, replacing a B Stock car. These two cars, numbered 4167 and 4176, were not rebuilt into Q Stock and were classified G23 Stock.

In 1965, several cars were renumbered by adding 100 to the number to avoid conflicting numbers with the 1967 Stock being built for the Victoria line.

==Withdrawal==
The majority of the cars were withdrawn in the early 1960s as CO/CP Stock trains transferred from the Metropolitan line started to become available. The last of the Q Stock was withdrawn in 1971.

Two driving motors have been preserved.

<text>Katunayake (, ), is a suburb of Negombo in Western Province, Sri Lanka. It is the site of Bandaranaike International Airport, the primary international air gateway to Sri Lanka. With the change of government in 1977 and the introduction of the open economy policy a large area was allocated to create a free trade zone (currently known as the Export Promotion Zone).

==Government and infrastructure==
Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka has its head office in Katunayake.

SriLankan Airlines is headquartered on the grounds of the airport in Katunayake.

==Economy==
In 1977 the country&#x27;s United National Party government introduced an open-economy policy, which led to the creation in 1978 of the country&#x27;s first Free-trade zone (FTZ), currently known as an Export Processing Zone, in Katunayake. Located approximately northeast of Colombo, adjacent to the Bandaranaike International Airport, the Katunayake KTZ covers and is the largest of the country&#x27;s eight FTZs. It is governed by the Sri Lankan Board of Investment. In order to attract foreign investment the government provides a number of incentives, including duty-free import and exports, preferential tax, double taxation relief and up to 100% foreign ownership. The Katunayake FTZ houses over one hundred multinational industries, predominantly in the garment and clothing industry. From its inception the FTZ the workforce was predominantly young female migrants from rural villages, mainly from economically and socially marginalised groups.

On 30 May 2011 the police attacked workers at the Katunayake FTZ, protesting against a proposed new pension plan, resulting in the death of one of the protesters and over 200 injuries. The police actions led to the Inspector General of Police, Mahinda Balasuriya, resigning his position.

==Transport==

Katunayake is the site of the primary airport in the country, Bandaranaike International Airport.

It is served by Sri Lanka Railways&#x27; Puttalam Line, with stations at Katunayake, Katunayake South, and the airport.

Negombo is the northern end of the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway which connects Colombo and A1 highway at Peliyagoda. Katunayake is currently served by the A3 highway from Colombo to Negombo.

<doc id="1317097" wikidata="Q4774272" url="?curid=1317097" title="Anti-Slavery Reporter">
<text>The Anti-Slavery Reporter was founded in London in 1825 as the Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter by Zachary Macaulay (1768–1838), a Scottish philanthropist who devoted most of his life to the anti-slavery movement. It was also referred to as the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter, and in 1909 merged with the &quot;Aborigines&#x27; Friend&quot; to form the Anti-Slavery Reporter and Aborigines&#x27; Friend. From 1981 the journal was again renamed the &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot;, and as a publication of Anti-Slavery International continued to be published occasionally as simply Reporter.

Under Macaulay and its subsequent editors, the journal campaigned vigorously for the abolition of slavery throughout the world in the late 19th century. Later, it focused more on various forms of modern slavery.

It was initially published by the anti-slavery organisation founded in 1823 as the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions, but after this wound up in 1838, came under the auspices of and published the Annual Reports of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (now known as Anti-Slavery International.)

==History==
===1823–1838===
From 1823 to 1838, the journal was published by the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions, commonly referred to as &quot;the Anti-Slavery Society&quot;.

Volume ii of the &quot;Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter&quot; is dated as commencing in June 1827 and ending in May 1828. It was printed in London for the &quot;London Society for the Mitigation and Abolition of Slavery in the British Dominions&quot; (officially the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions), and printed as a monograph in 1829.

The title remained &quot;Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter&quot; until July 1830, dropping the &quot;Monthly&quot; to become &quot;The Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot; in August 1830 (Volume 3, No. 62?).

===1839–1980 ===
In 1839 the new, internationally focused British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) was founded, after the previous British Empire-focused organisation was wound up. A &quot;new series&quot;, described as the 3rd series, started with volume 1, number 1 on 1 January 1846. The title pages for the volumes between 1846 and 1852 read &quot;The British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot;.

The journal merged with the &quot;Aborigines&#x27; Friend&quot; to form the &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter and Aborigines&#x27; Friend&quot; in 1909, when the BFASS merged with the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society to form the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society.

===1981–2000s ===
From 1981 the journal was called simply &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot;.

It appears to have been published into the 1990s, on an annual or quarterly basis. An Anti-Slavery International publication in 2005 lists in its bibliography &quot;Anti-Slavery International, &quot;Reporter&quot;, London, various issues between 1999–2005&quot;, and states &quot;Anti-Slavery International’s quarterly magazine the &quot;Reporter&quot; has been published since 1825 and continues to be a leading source of news and analysis in relation to slavery issues&quot;.

==Description==
Under Macaulay and its subsequent editors, the journal campaigned vigorously for the abolition of slavery throughout the world in the late 19th century. Its articles include detailed reports of the activities of the abolitionists; reports of the Parliamentary procedures which ultimately led to the abolition of slavery throughout Britain and her colonies; and details of the political activities of pro- and anti-slavery supporters in other countries.

<doc id="1317098" wikidata="Q606523" url="?curid=1317098" title="Brandon Novak">
<text>Brandon Thomas Novak (born December 10, 1978) is an American motivational speaker, author, and former professional skateboarder and CKY crew member. He also had appearances in the &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; reality comedy series and the &quot;Jackass&quot; films.

==Early life==
Novak was born on December 10, 1978, in Baltimore, Maryland.

== Career ==
=== Professional skateboarding ===
Novak started skateboarding at seven years old and was soon discovered by Bucky Lasek. He was the first skateboarder in the world to be sponsored by Gatorade at 14 years old. At this same time, he was a professional skateboarder on the Powell Peralta Team, traveling the country with Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Tony Hawk, and others. Due to his substance abuse he was presented with the option to quit or attend rehab which he chose to quit.

Upon achieving sobriety in 2015, Novak returned to skateboarding. In 2020, he finally achieved his dream of creating a pro-deck with The Heart Supply (run by CEO and Founder of Element, Johnny Schillereff). They released the Brandon Novak Heart Supply collection in June 2020.

In July 2021, Novak and fellow professional skateboarder Joey Jett released a short film of their journey to Barcelona titled &quot;The Awakening&quot; showcasing their skateboarding and journey.

=== Entertainment persona ===

Novak makes appearances in &quot;CKY3&quot; (2001), and &quot;CKY4: The Latest &amp; Greatest&quot; (2002), and in Bam Margera&#x27;s films &quot;&quot; (2003), and &quot;Minghags&quot; (2009). In &quot;Haggard&quot;, Novak plays a friendly drug dealer named Dooli, which was the real nickname of Novak&#x27;s dealer in northwest Baltimore. He also appeared in Bam&#x27;s TV shows &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; (2003-2006), &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; (2007), and &quot;Bam&#x27;s Bad Ass Game Show&quot; (2014), and also made guest appearances in the &quot;Jackass&quot; movies &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; (2006), &quot;Jackass 2.5&quot; (2007), &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; (2010), and &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; (2011).

He appeared regularly on the SIRIUS Satellite Radio show &quot;Radio Bam&quot;. One notable radio appearance was on December 26, 2005, where Margera gave Novak $500 to hire two sex workers as a Christmas gift. As Novak was having sex with the women live on air in the studio, SIRIUS Satellite Radio cut off the show. This was significant as it was the first time SIRIUS had ever censored a program before.

Also in 2005, Novak arrived on the red carpet at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards wearing nothing except a computer keyboard. The night prior he had brought back girls to his hotel room and sometime in the night had thrown his clothes off the balcony. Having no clothes for the VMA&#x27;s, he decided on a keyboard.

In 2008, Novak appeared in &quot;Bam Margera Presents: Where the#$&amp;% Is Santa?&quot;, which featured Novak and several other cast members trying to find Santa Claus. That same year, Novak appeared in a pornographic film by Gina Lynn called &quot;The Fantasstic Whores 4&quot; with Margera while Margera had a &quot;prominent, non-sex role&quot;.

In 2010, Novak appeared in &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; in multiple scenes. Novak also had a more prominent role in the follow-up film &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot;, which was released in 2011.

In 2013 and 2014, Novak traveled around the world as the opening act for rock and roll band Fuckface Unstoppable. Performing as &quot;Pill&quot; Collins, a spoof of Phil Collins, he would sing &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; to open the shows. He would be heavily intoxicated, known for coming out naked and spraying the crowd with wine.

He has also been featured on Howard Stern&#x27;s Most Outrageous Moments for his appearance in a 2008 episode where he stripped naked and licked Richard Christy&#x27;s anus for $280.

=== Author of &quot;Dreamseller&quot; and &quot;The Streets of Baltimore&quot; ===
Novak, along with co-author and CKY filmographer Joe Frantz, authored his first book, titled &quot;Dreamseller&quot;, which is based on his life and experiences with heroin in Baltimore. The book was published on October 18, 2008. A paperback version of the book was released exactly a year after its original publishing on October 18, 2009.

A movie, also to be titled &quot;Dreamseller&quot;, was supposed to be in production in early 2007, but was stopped when Novak began using heroin again. On the December 17, 2007 episode of Radio Bam, it was announced that the movie may be completed in the near future with Bam Margera starring as Novak in the film.

In 2015, the idea of a movie was again floated, but Novak claimed that to secure funding they would have to approve Justin Bieber playing Novak, which they felt wasn&#x27;t the right direction. Production ceased again.

In 2018, Novak and Frantz released a graphic novel titled &quot;The Brandon Novak Chronicles: The Shocking True Addiction Stories of a Counter-Culture Icon&quot;.

Novak released a second book titled &quot;The Streets of Baltimore&quot; in 2020, marking the five-year anniversary of his sobriety, which chronicles more of his struggle with addiction.

==Battles with drug abuse==
Before achieving sobriety in 2015, Novak struggled for over 20 years with addictions to heroin, cocaine, pain pills, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. He spent his 19th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, and 35th birthdays in a jail or treatment center.

When Novak was 14, he was a professional skateboarder on the Powell Peralta Team, traveling the country with Bucky Lasek, Tony Hawk, and others. Despite his meteoric rise to success, his drug use was discovered by Mike Vallely and Tony Hawk presented him with the choice to leave the team or attend rehab for his &quot;psychoactive substance abuse&quot;; he elected to leave the team. Over the next 20 years, he went to rehab 13 times, was frequently arrested, overdosed over four times, stole from his friends and family, and prostituted himself to pay for drugs.

Novak was clean for almost four years, from 2003 to 2007, before relapsing.

Novak was absent from the January 23, 2006 episode of &quot;Radio Bam&quot; on Sirius Satellite Radio while he attended rehab for addiction to pills. On February 26, 2007, Novak admitted on Radio Bam that while he had quit using heroin, he still regularly abused cocaine and pain medication and frequently drank alcohol. While it was not mentioned on the radio show, Novak broke both ankles the day before Margera&#x27;s wedding while skating with Tony Hawk and Margera during filming for &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; on February 2, 2007. He was shown holding a bottle of prescription pain killers afterwards. Margera stated on &quot;Radio Bam&quot; that Novak relapsed in March 2007 and was seeking treatment in a rehabilitation clinic. It is unclear if this incident led to his relapse, or if the relapse was already occurring by this time.

Margera announced on the April 3, 2007 episode of Radio Bam that Novak had a relapse with his addiction to heroin and was back in rehab. On the July 30, 2007 episode of Radio Bam, Margera and Chad I Ginsburg were discussing the topic of heroin and announced that Novak&#x27;s addiction was &quot;the worst [Bam] had ever seen&quot; and that Novak was &quot;just killing himself now&quot;. He was kicked out of rehab in Scranton, Pennsylvania, after heroin pills were found in his bag. Novak claimed that the pills were &quot;planted&quot; on him. On a Radio Bam episode in November, Novak stated that he had attempted suicide three weeks before the radio show, as a result of a heroin binge, but survived it.

On the December 17, 2007 episode of Radio Bam, Novak was asked to leave Margera&#x27;s house again when he lied on air about not having pills and being clean. He had recently been released from a psychiatric ward he had been held in for 12 days because of suicidal tendencies and drug use. The crew found multiple bars of Xanax on Novak, which he claimed had been prescribed to him. Joe Frantz and Margera exiled Novak for a period of time as a result. On the March 3, 2008 episode of Radio Bam, Novak stated that he was 33 days clean and would appear in Bam&#x27;s new MTV show.

In March 2009, Frantz had a phone conversation with Novak about his attempted suicide and mental health issues that resulted in him being institutionalized. On March 9, 2009, Novak appeared on Radio Bam and discussed getting out of the mental institution, his drug use, and the delusions that led to the problems.

=== Influence ===
Novak and his battles with addiction influenced a number of songs.

In a 2006 episode of &quot;Loveline&quot; with Dr. Drew, lead vocalist of HIM, Ville Valo confirmed their song &quot;Killing Loneliness&quot; was inspired by Novak who blamed his heroin addiction on a need to, &quot;kill the loneliness.&quot;

Bam Margera&#x27;s band Fuckface Unstoppable produced two songs heavily featuring Novak. &quot;Moonshine&quot;, where in the chorus Margera sings about Novak and the music video begins with a naked Novak throwing a fit outside of a gas station.

In 2013, Margera also developed the song &quot;Till the Wheels Fal Alf&quot;. The music video opens with Novak intoxicated on the phone and ends with a naked Novak being dragged out of a building. The song contains lyrics alluding to Novak&#x27;s addiction to pills.

In 2017, the band Black Haze released a song titled &quot;Dreamseller&quot;, as an ode to Novak&#x27;s nickname. The music video contains videos of Novak pre-sobriety.

=== Arrests and jail sentence ===
Prior to achieving sobriety, Novak had a long history in and out of the legal system. Novak has been charged over 30 times with charges ranging from burglary to possession over the course of 1997–2014.

In a 2008 interview, Bam Margera details how Novak was featured on &quot;World&#x27;s Dumbest Criminals&quot; following a humorous arrest where Novak breaks into a gas station during a blizzard, leaves with the stolen goods, then realizing he has nowhere to go, decides to return to the gas station and sleep. He awakes to the police questioning him.

On July 7, 2010, Novak was arrested at Chester County Hospital for an outstanding warrant after being admitted to the hospital for breaking several bones filming a scene for &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;. He was charged with forging a prescription after he tried to pass a fake prescription for Xanax at a Walgreens in Media, Pennsylvania.

On November 3, 2010, Novak was sentenced to 11–23 months. His initial sentence called for the first 30 weeks, to be spent as weekend confinement at the George W. Hill Correctional Facility in Thornton, Pennsylvania. After his weekends were completed, Novak would spend six months on house arrest until eligible for release.

In early February 2011, Novak claimed on &quot;Radio Bam&quot; that he had used his cellmate&#x27;s urine to pass a drug test and mentioned the facility by name. The episode was intercepted by the staff at the correctional facility, and on February 11, 2011, the judge revoked Novak&#x27;s weekend sentence and ordered him to be jailed for 10 months. Novak was released from the jail on December 30, 2011. He was then on parole for one year and was on probation until the end of 2013, during which time he had to stay clean of illegal substances.

=== Feud with Bam Margera ===

A feud between Novak and childhood best friend Bam Margera began in 2019 as a result of Margera&#x27;s continued substance abuse problems. Margera has routinely taken to Instagram to attack Novak. In early 2021, Margera shared a series of text messages between himself and Novak with him saying to Novak, &quot;Your not signing a book on my turf till you admit who you are. You can&#x27;t just keep coming around my way. Dont you reply to your best friend?&quot; He additionally went on Instagram Live while intoxicated, claiming his best friend and &quot;life partner&quot; Brandon Novak promised him a new car and Margera felt betrayed by him. In further posts, alluding to the financial support he provided Novak for rehab attempts, he says, &quot;If you fucking faggots don&#x27;t think I fixed Novak then tell that to the 150,000.00 I have spent on fixing him! Fuckers.&quot;

In a 2019 interview, Novak addresses the personal attacks from Margera, &quot;You see Bam&#x27;s public tirades and the fact that he focused a lot of his attention and his anger on me for a little while.. Did it hurt? Absolutely. Was I angry? Absolutely. Did I retaliate? Definitely not. The reality is why me, why me, it&#x27;s like why the fuck not me? As many times as I hurt him, I took advantage of him, I lied to him, I stole from him, he always lent a hand. And now what better person to understand where he&#x27;s at than me? There&#x27;s nothing he could say that would offend me or make me abandon our friendship. I won&#x27;t and I&#x27;ll see this through with him till the very end, good, bad, or indifferent.&quot;

==Sobriety==

After a string of relapses and homelessness, Novak entered Today, Inc. in Langhorne, Pennsylvania and successfully completed treatment. He has been clean and sober since May 25, 2015. He now serves as a Certified Intervention Professional and serves as a motivational speaker.

Novak tours the nation sharing his story of recovery and message of hope, seeking to help suffering addicts. He has appeared on broadcasts nationally. In all media appearances he encourages anyone who is struggling to reach out to him for help directly. He even provides his personal cellphone number to audiences for anyone who needs help.

Novak serves as the keynote speaker for the DEA&#x27;s Youth Summit events, bringing drug awareness and education to high schools and organizations across the nation.

He starred in &quot;Facing Addiction in America&quot;, a television special featuring celebrities who had been affected by addiction. The special was aired on BET, Comedy Central, CMT, Logo TV, MTV, MTV2, MTV Classic, MTV Live, Spike TV, TV Land, and VH1.

TENGA Productions produced a video with Novak telling his story that went viral on YouTube. It was shown in more than 40 US markets and garnered more than 4.5 million views inspiring countless individuals to reach out for help.

===Novak&#x27;s House===

Novak, alongside George Evagelou, founded Novak&#x27;s House, a sober home in Delaware for young men in recovery. As of 2022, there are three Novak&#x27;s Houses located in Wilmington, Delaware.

In February 2022, Novak, alongside manager Allison Rush and Julie Johnson, held the first-ever Novak&#x27;s House gala in Boca Raton, Florida to raise money for sober living scholarships. The event raised nearly $70,000 and was featured on WPTV-TV, Yahoo! Sports, and ESPN.

Also in 2022, Novak and Johnson partnered with the Mountain Dew Skate Tour and Punk Rock and Paintbrushes to sponsor an art show and also raise money for Novak&#x27;s House scholarships through a VIP event. Brandon and Julie continued their support for Punk Rock and Paintbrushes artists and scholarships by sponsoring a show at Tony Hawk&#x27;s Weekend Jam in May 2022.

<doc id="1317100" wikidata="Q461765" url="?curid=1317100" title="Oxford shoe">
<text>An Oxford shoe is a type of shoe characterized by shoelace eyelet tabs that are attached under the vamp, a feature termed &quot;closed lacing&quot;. This contrasts with Derbys, or bluchers, which have shoelace eyelets attached to the top of the vamp. Originally, Oxfords were plain, formal shoes, made of leather, but they evolved into a range of styles suitable for formal, uniform, or casual wear. On the basis of function and the dictates of fashion, Oxfords are now made from a variety of materials, including calf leather, faux and genuine patent leather, suede, and canvas. They are normally black or brown, and may be plain or patterned (brogue).

==Terminology==
The meaning of &quot;Oxford&quot; and &quot;balmoral&quot; may vary geographically. In the United States and Scotland, &quot;Balmoral&quot; is often synonymous with &quot;Oxford&quot;. In the United States, &quot;Oxford&quot; is sometimes used for any more formal lace-up shoe, including the Blucher and Derby. In Britain and other countries, the Balmoral is an Oxford with no seams, apart from the toe cap seam, descending to the welt, a style common on boots. Oxford shoes are also known for their variation or style. The Cap-Toe Oxford is the most well-known, although &#x27;Whole Cut&#x27;, &#x27;Plain Toe&#x27;, and a variation of &#x27;Brogue&#x27; Oxfords are commonly referred to styles. Shoes with closed lacing (Oxfords/Balmorals) are considered more formal than those with open lacing (Bluchers/Derbys). A particular type of oxford shoe is the wholecut oxford, its upper made from a single piece of leather with only a single seam at the back or in the rare exception no seams at all.

==History==
Oxfords first appeared in Scotland and Ireland, where they are occasionally called Balmorals after Balmoral Castle. However, the shoes were later named Oxfords after Oxford University. This shoe style did not appear in North America until the 1800s. In the United States, Oxfords are called &quot;Bal-type&quot; as opposed to &quot;Blucher-type&quot;. In France, Oxfords are known as Richelieu, or Molière in Belgium and Luxembourg.

Oxfords were derived from the Oxonian, a half-boot with side slits that gained popularity at Oxford University in 1800. Unlike early shoes, Oxfords were cut smaller than the foot. The side slit evolved into a side lace that eventually moved to the instep, as students rebelled against knee-high and ankle-high boots. The toe cap can either be lined with two narrow rows of stitching, perforated holes along the end cap stitching (quarter-brogue), perforated holes along the end cap stitching and on the toe cap (semi-brogue), or a semi-brogue with the classical wingtip design (full-brogue).

<doc id="1317110" wikidata="Q6670932" url="?curid=1317110" title="London Underground Q38 Stock">
<text>The Q Stock consisted of various District line trains, built from 1923 (G Stock) until the mid-1930s, originally built with manually operated sliding doors. Following conversion to air operated doors, the trains became collectively known as Q Stock. Given that five different types of rolling stock were converted to Q Stock, the resulting hybrid trains looked bizarre - with the older carriages having flat sides and clerestory roofs, whilst the Q38 had flared sides at floor level.

==Q38 Stock==
The Q38 Stock, designed by LT&#x27;s Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Graff-Baker, was built in 1939 for the District line by Gloucester RC&amp;W to operate with the older, converted cars. The units had a similar profile to the Metropolitan line O/P Stock built in 1935 and to the R47 Stock, R49 Stock, and R59 Stock built between 1949 and 1959.

The Q38 stock consisted of 25 driving motor cars and 183 trailers. Motor cars were numbered in the District line 4xxx series whilst the trailer cars were numbered with the O and P stock trailers.

The Q38 trailers first entered service on the District Line 14 November 1938, and the motor cars (with some trailers) on the Metropolitan Line on 27 March 1939. With the introduction of the P stock on the Metropolitan Line from 17 July 1939, the Q stock trains were redeployed on the District Line, a process which had been completed by the end of November 1939.

==Numbers==

==Conversions==
After the war, 132 of the trailer cars were rebuilt for use with the R Stock, being converted into Driving Motor cars and reclassified R38 Stock. The conversion to R stock was helped by the fact that one end was designed to be easily convertible to a driving cab, including the provision of driver&#x27;s cab doors.

In 1959/60, 17 Q38 trailers were converted for use as trailers with the CO / CP Stock. This was in connection with the conversion of Circle Line trains from five to six cars in length. A further eight were converted when the A62 stock displaced the P stock on the Metropolitan Line, with the P stock being transferred to the District Line.

==Withdrawal==
In the final years of service, Q Stock units were used on the East London Line, before withdrawal in 1971. The Q Stock was replaced on the District Line by CO/CP Stock displaced from the Circle Line and Hammersmith &amp; City Line by the introduction of C69 Stock.

Two driving motors have been preserved:
* DM no. 4416 - London Transport Museum, Acton
* DM no. 4417 - London Transport Museum, Acton

* G series (Toronto subway) - influenced by the Q38 design and built by same builder

<text>In computer networking, the ICMP Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP), also called the Internet Router Discovery Protocol, is a protocol for computer hosts to discover the presence and location of routers on their IPv4 local area network. Router discovery is useful for accessing computer systems on other nonlocal area networks. The IRDP is defined by the IETF RFC 1256 standard, with the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) upon which it is based defined in IETF RFC 792. IRDP eliminates the need to manually configure routing information.

== Router discovery messages ==

To enable router discovery, the IRDP defines two kinds of ICMP messages:

* The ICMP Router Solicitation message is sent from a computer host to any routers on the local area network to request that they advertise their presence on the network.
* The ICMP Router Advertisement message is sent by a router on the local area network to announce its IP address as available for routing.

When a host boots up, it sends solicitation messages to IP multicast address 224.0.0.2. In response, one or more routers may send advertisement messages. If there is more than one router, the host usually picks the first message it gets and adds that router to its routing table. Independently of a solicitation, a router may periodically send out advertisement messages. These messages are not considered a routing protocol, as they do not determine a routing path, just the presence of possible gateways.

== Extensions ==

The IRDP strategy has been used in the development of the IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol. These use ICMPv6 messages, the IPv6 analog of ICMP messages. Neighbor discovery is governed by IETF standards RFC 4861 and RFC 4862.

IRDP plays an essential role in mobile networking through IETF standard RFC 3344. This is called MIPv4 &quot;Agent discovery&quot;.

<text>A Slip sheet is “a corrugated, solid fiber, or plastic sheet onto which a unit load can be assembled. A protruding short panel can be grasped by the jaws of a pull-pack truck and the load pulled back onto the pull-pack platform.”

==Construction==
Several constructions are available. replacing traditional wooden pallets. The unit load is usually stretch wrapped or shrink wrapped for stability.

Many are constructed corrugated fiberboard or a thick solid fiber sheet. They are typically the size of a pallet or of the load to go on a pallet. One or more sides has a lip which extends from the load to allow grasping by a special push-pull attachment on a modified fork truck. 

Plastic slip sheets can be made of corrugated plastic or a molded shape. Sometimes the lip on the slipsheet can extend on all sides resembling a tray or shallow basket. These slip sheets are well suited to a returnable and reusable closed-loop system, 
==Use==
A common usage would be for the slip sheet to be placed on a pallet and loaded with boxes or bags. This loaded pallet might be going to a warehouse for storage: most slip sheets are not rigid enough to support loads in warehouse racks. 
When needed, the load can be called to the loading dock where a special fork lift truck will grab the lip of the slip sheet and pull it onto a flat steel platform. Some roller platforms are also available.

The slip sheet and load are then loaded onto a truck, rail car, of intermodal container and placed on the floor. This reduces the volume and weight of the pallet for shipment. At the end of the shipment, similar fork trucks with puch-pull attachments grab the loads and place them on pallets for further storage, distribution, or use,

==Comparison with pallets==
Each system has some advantages. A thorough analysis is useful to determine all cost factors for a particular situation. The primary advantages of a slip sheet system, is the reduction in material cost compared with a pallet and the ability to increase the density of packages per truck or shipping container. The disadvantages might include the need for special handling equipment at both ends of the shipment.

<doc id="1317131" wikidata="Q605107" url="?curid=1317131" title="String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 14 in D minor, D 810, known as Death and the Maiden, is a piece by Franz Schubert that has been called &quot;one of the pillars of the chamber music repertoire&quot;. It was composed in 1824, after the composer suffered from a serious illness and realized that he was dying. It is named for the theme of the second movement, which Schubert took from a song he wrote in 1817 of the same title. But, writes Walter Willson Cobbett, all four movements of the quartet are welded &quot;into a unity under the pressure of a dominating idea - the dance of death.&quot;

The quartet was first played in 1826 in a private home, and was not published until 1831, three years after Schubert&#x27;s death.

==Composition==
1823 and 1824 were hard years for Schubert. For much of 1823 he was sick, some scholars believe with an outburst of tertiary stage syphilis, and in May had to be hospitalized. He was also without money: he had entered into a disastrous deal with Diabelli to publish a batch of works, and received almost no payment; and his latest attempt at opera, &quot;Fierrabras&quot;, was a flop. In a letter to a friend, he wrote,


Yet, despite his bad health, poverty and depression, Schubert continued to turn out the tuneful, light and &quot;gemütlich&quot; music that made him the toast of Viennese society: the song cycle &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, the octet for string quartet, contrabass, clarinet, horn and bassoon, more than 20 songs, and numerous light pieces for piano.

After 1820, Schubert returned to the string quartet form, which he had last visited as a teenager. He wrote the one-movement &quot;Quartettsatz&quot; in 1820, and the &quot;Rosamunde&quot; quartet in 1824 using a theme from the incidental music that he wrote for a play that failed. These quartets are a huge step forward from his initial attempts. Even Schubert recognized this fact; in July 1824, he wrote to his brother Ferdinand of his earlier quartets, &quot;it would be better if you stuck to other quartets than mine, for there is nothing in them...&quot; There are several qualities that set these mature quartets apart from Schubert&#x27;s earlier attempts. In the early quartets, it is primarily the first violin that carries the melody, with the other instruments playing supporting roles; in the later quartets, the part writing is much more advanced, and each instrument brings its own character and presence, for a more complex and integrated texture. Also, the later quartets are structurally much more integrated, with motifs, harmonies, and textures recurring in a way that ties the entire work together.
But beyond these technical improvements, Schubert in these later works made the quartet medium his own. &quot;He had now ceased to write quartets to order, for experimental study, or for the home circle&quot;, writes Walter Willson Cobbett. &quot;To the independent artist... the string quartet had now also become a vehicle for conveying to the world his inner struggles.&quot; For Schubert, who lived a life suspended between the lyrical, romantic, charming and the dramatic, chaotic, and depressive, the string quartet offered a medium &quot;to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts&quot;, writes music historian Homer Ulrich.

Schubert wrote the D minor quartet in March 1824, within weeks of completing the A minor &quot;Rosamunde&quot; quartet. He apparently planned to publish a three-set volume of quartets; but the Rosamunde was published within a year, while the D minor quartet was only published in 1831, three years after Schubert&#x27;s death, by Diabelli. It was first played in January 1826 at the Vienna home of Karl and Franz Hacker, amateur violinists, apparently with Schubert on the viola.

==Inspiration==
The quartet takes its name from the lied &quot;Der Tod und das Mädchen&quot;, D 531, a setting of the poem of the same name by Matthias Claudius, that Schubert wrote in 1817. The theme of the song forms the basis of the second movement of the quartet. The theme is a death knell that accompanies the song about the terror and comfort of death.

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;&quot;The Maiden&quot;:
&quot;Oh! leave me! Prithee, leave me! thou grisly man of bone!
For life is sweet, is pleasant.
Go! leave me now alone!
Go! leave me now alone!&quot;

&quot;Death&quot;:
&quot;Give me thy hand, oh! maiden fair to see,
For I&#x27;m a friend, hath ne&#x27;er distress&#x27;d thee.
Take courage now, and very soon
Within mine arms shalt softly rest thee!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

But it is not only this theme of the quartet that recalls death. The quote from the song &quot;makes explicit the overriding theme of the work, its bleak vision and almost unremitting foreboding&quot;, writes Andrew Clements. From the violent opening unison. the first movement runs a relentless race through terror, pain and resignation, ending with a dying D minor chord. &quot;The struggle with Death is the subject of the first movement, and the andante accordingly dwells on Death&#x27;s words&quot;, writes Cobbett. After a scherzo movement, with a trio that provides the only lyrical respite from the depressing mood of the piece, the quartet ends with a tarantella – the traditional dance to ward off madness and death. &quot;The finale is most definitely in the character of a dance of death; ghastly visions whirl past in the inexorable uniform rhythm of the tarantella&quot;, writes Cobbett.
So strong is the association of death with the quartet that some analysts consider it to be programmatic, rather than absolute music. &quot;The first movement of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; string quartet can be interpreted in a quasi-programmatic fashion, even though it is usually viewed as an abstract work&quot;, writes Deborah Kessler. Theologian Frank Ruppert sees the quartet as a musical expression of Judaeo-Christian religious myths. &quot;This quartet, like so many of Schubert&#x27;s works, is a kind of para-liturgy&quot;, he writes. Each movement is about a different episode in the mythic process of death and resurrection.

==Analysis==
The quartet throughout is characterized by sudden dramatic shifts from fortissimo to pianissimo, from the lyrical to the compelling and dramatic. A driving undercurrent of triplets is a recurring motif in all four movements.

There are four movements:
# Allegro, in D minor and common time ()
# Andante con moto, in G minor and cut time ()
# Scherzo: Allegro molto, in D minor and time
# Presto, in D minor and time

===First movement: Allegro===
===Second movement: Andante con moto===
===Third movement: Scherzo - Allegro molto===

Cobbett describes the third movement as the &quot;dance of the demon fiddler&quot;. There is indeed something demonic in this fast-paced scherzo, full of syncopations and, like the other movements, dramatic leaps from &quot;fortissimo&quot; to &quot;pianissimo&quot;.

The scherzo is designed as a classical minuet: two strains in time, repeated, in D minor, followed by a contrasting trio section in D major, at a slower tempo, and ending with a recapitulation of the opening strains. The trio section is the only real respite from the compelling pace of the whole quartet: a typically Schubertesque melody, with the first violin playing a dancing descant above the melody line in the lower voices, then the viola takes the melody as the first violin plays high eighth notes.

The scherzo is a short movement, serving as an interlude leading to the frenetic last movement.

===Fourth movement: Presto===

The finale of the quartet is a tarantella in rondo-sonata form, in D minor. The tarantella is a breakneck Italian dance in 6/8 time, that, according to tradition, was a treatment for madness and convulsions brought on by the bite of a tarantula spider. Appropriately, Cobbett calls this movement &quot;a dance of death&quot;.

The movement is built of sections. The first, main section recurs between each of the subsequent sections.

==Reception==

After the initial reading of the quartet in 1826, the quartet was played again at a house concert in the home of composer Franz Lachner, with violinist Ignaz Schuppanzigh leading. Schuppanzigh, one of the leading violinists of the time, who debuted many of Beethoven&#x27;s and Schubert&#x27;s quartets, was reportedly unimpressed. &quot;Brother, this is nothing at all, let well alone: stick to your Lieder&quot;, the aging Schuppanzigh is reported to have said to Schubert.

Schuppanzigh&#x27;s impressions notwithstanding, Schubert&#x27;s quartet soon won a leading place on the concert stage and in the hearts of musicians. &quot;Only the excellence of such a work as Schubert&#x27;s D minor Quartet... can in any way console us for the early and grievous death of this first-born of Beethoven; in a few years he achieved and perfected things as no one before him&quot;, wrote Robert Schumann of the quartet.

In a testament to the work&#x27;s enduring popularity, it has been the most played string quartet in Carnegie Hall history with 56 performances.

The quartet has been honored by several transcriptions. In 1847, Robert Franz transcribed it for piano duet, and in 1896 Mahler planned an arrangement for string orchestra and notated the details in a score of the quartet (the work was never completed, however, and only the second movement was written out and played; modern revivals of the arrangement are by David Matthews and Kenneth Woods).

In the 20th century, British composer John Foulds and American composer Andy Stein made versions for full symphony orchestra.

The US composer George Crumb incorporated the theme of the second movement into his string quartet Black Angels.

At Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s state funeral in 1930, &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; was performed instead of speeches.

The quartet has also inspired other works. Ariel Dorfman&#x27;s 1991 play &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, adapted for film in 1994 by Roman Polanski, is about a woman tortured and raped in a South American dictatorship, to the strains of the quartet. It has also appeared as incidental music in numerous films: &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (Jane Campion, 1996), &quot;What?&quot; (Roman Polanski, 1972), &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking&quot; (BBC production, 2004), &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot; (1971) and in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s radio play &quot;All That Fall&quot; (1962).

<text>The Serra do Mar (; ) is a long system of mountain ranges and escarpments in Southeastern Brazil.

==Geography==
The Serra do Mar runs parallel to the Atlantic Ocean coast from the state of Espírito Santo to southern Santa Catarina, although some literature includes the Serra Geral in the Serra do Mar, in which case the range would extend to northeastern Rio Grande do Sul.

The main escarpment forms the boundary between the sea-level littoral and the inland plateau (&quot;planalto&quot;), which has a mean altitude of . This escarpment is part of the Great Escarpment that runs along much of the eastern coast of Brazil south from the city of Salvador, Bahia.

==Mountain ranges==
The mountain ranges are discontinuous in several places and are given individual names such as Serra de Bocaina, Serra de Paranapiacaba, Serra Negra, Serra dos Órgãos, Serra do Indaiá, etc. The range also extends to some large islands near the coastline, such as Ilhabela and Ilha Anchieta. With an altitude of , Pico da Caledônia in Nova Friburgo is among the highest points in Serra do Mar.

Geologically, the range belongs to the massive crystalline rock platform that forms Eastern South America, and tectonically it is very stable. Most of the elevations of Serra do Mar were formed about 60 million years ago.

==Natural history==

At the time of the European discovery of Brazil (1500), the Serra do Mar supported a rich and highly diversified ecosystem, composed mainly of lush tropical rain forest, called &quot;Atlantic Forest&quot; (&quot;Mata Atlântica&quot;). Due to urbanization and deforestation, however, most of the forest cover has been destroyed and what little cover remains is almost exclusively on the steep escarpments facing the sea.

A chain of national and state parks, ecological stations and biological reserves now protect the Mata Atlântica and its biological heritage, but acid rain, pollution, poachers, clandestine loggers, forest fires and encroachment by urban areas and farms are still causing active destruction, particularly in the areas around cities. Several large metropolises, such as Vale do Itajaí, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are near the &quot;Serra do Mar&quot;.

Reforestation and recuperation of biological diversity are notoriously difficult to bring about in destroyed rainforest habitats.

<doc id="1317158" wikidata="Q2634325" url="?curid=1317158" title="Blame It on Lisa">
<text>&quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Written by Bob Bendetson and directed by Steven Dean Moore, &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; features several references to popular culture, including a parody of the Brazilian children&#x27;s television host Xuxa and an allusion to the film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;. When it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 2002, it was seen by around eleven million people. In 2010, the episode was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the episodes of the thirteenth season.

&quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; attracted controversy in Brazil because of its inclusion of clichés and stereotypes, including frequent depictions of crime, slums and rat infestations, as well as cultural inaccuracies. Riotur, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro, planned on taking legal action against Fox for damaging the international image of the city. James L. Brooks, executive producer of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, soon issued an apology to Rio de Janeiro.

==Plot==

Marge discovers that the Simpson family has run up a $400.00 telephone bill due to a call to Brazil. After the phone company cuts off the family&#x27;s service for non-payment and Homer repeatedly injures himself trying to restore it, Lisa admits that she made the call in order to stay in touch with Ronaldo, an orphan boy she has been sponsoring. She had been receiving monthly letters from him until recently; when they stopped, she called the orphanage where he was staying and was told that he had gone missing. When Lisa plays a videotaped message from Ronaldo, telling her that he used her money to buy a pair of dancing shoes, Homer, Marge, and Bart decide to fly to Brazil with her and find him. They leave Maggie in the care of Patty and Selma.

Once the Simpsons arrive in Rio de Janeiro, they begin searching for Ronaldo—first in the city&#x27;s slums, then at his orphanage—but without success. When they split into pairs to cover more ground, Homer and Bart are robbed by a gang of children and later kidnapped in a taxicab. Bart escapes to tell Marge and Lisa, and the kidnappers take Homer to a hideout within the Brazilian rainforest and demand $50,000.00 for his release. Unable to pay the ransom themselves or to borrow the money from anyone in Springfield, the remaining three Simpsons begin looking for Homer. They get caught up in a Carnaval parade, during which Lisa finds Ronaldo—now working as a flamingo-costumed dancer on a popular children&#x27;s television program. He explains that the shoes he bought led to this job and a high salary, and gives the Simpsons the $50,000.00 they need, noting that he keeps all his earnings since he has no parents who can steal from him.

When they arrive at a meeting point arranged by the kidnappers—on adjacent aerial lift cars above Sugarloaf Mountain—they find that Homer has developed Stockholm syndrome and made a scrapbook to remember his kidnapping. They throw the money across and Homer jumps to the family&#x27;s car, only for the cables to break and send them tumbling down the mountainside. They survive unharmed, and Homer thanks his family for being there to get him out of trouble. Bart is immediately swallowed whole by an anaconda, but is not troubled and begins dancing to samba music.

==Production==

&quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; was written by Bob Bendetson and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the thirteenth season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (2001–2002). For the scenes taking place in Brazil, the animators based much of their work on photographs taken by a staff member who had previously visited the country. This episode is not the first in which the Simpsons travel to a location outside of the United States. Throughout the series, they have visited Antarctica, Aruba, Australia, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, France, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, South Korea, Spain, Tanzania and the United Kingdom. Their visit to Brazil in &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; was later referenced in the eighteenth-season episode &quot;The Wife Aquatic&quot; (2007), in which the family makes a trip to an island called Barnacle Bay that they discover has been devastated by overfishing. Lisa says to Bart: &quot;This is the most disgusting place we&#x27;ve ever gone,&quot; to which Bart asks: &quot;What about Brazil?&quot; Lisa corrects herself, responding: &quot;After Brazil.&quot;

Several references to popular culture are included in the episode. The title &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; refers to the 1984 film &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot;, which also takes place in Brazil. As Homer and Bart walk on Copacabana Beach, the famous 1939 song &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; (also known as &quot;Brazil&quot;) is played. &quot;ABCDEF&quot; is a parody of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Xuxa&quot; that attracted complaints because of the revealing outfits worn by the host, Brazilian actress and singer Xuxa. &quot;Teleboobies&quot;, Bart&#x27;s nickname for &quot;ABCDEF&quot;, is a reference to the British television series &quot;Teletubbies&quot;. The &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; cartoon that Homer and Bart watch at the beginning of the episode parodies Georges Méliès&#x27;s 1902 film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;; Itchy and Scratchy are playing golf when Itchy hits Scratchy&#x27;s head with his golf club, sending his head crashing into the Man in the Moon as the rocket does in the film. According to showrunner Al Jean, the staff members of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; asked American golfer Tiger Woods to do a guest appearance in this cartoon, but they were turned down.

==Release==
In its original broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 2002, &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; received a 6.3 Nielsen rating and was seen by approximately eleven million people. The episode finished forty-third in the ratings for the week of March 25–31, 2002, tying with a new episode of the comedy series &quot;George Lopez&quot; and the news program &quot;48 Hours&quot;. In addition, it became the highest-rated program on Fox that week. On August 24, 2010, &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of the box set &quot;The Simpsons – The Complete Thirteenth Season&quot;. Staff members Steven Dean Moore, Al Jean, Matt Groening, Matt Selman, Tim Long, John Frink, Don Payne, Joel H. Cohen, Matt Warburton, David Silverman, and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode.

Bendetson was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category for his work on the episode, but lost to Ken Keeler, the writer of the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Godfellas&quot;.

Reception of &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; from television critics has been mixed. Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com cited it as the best episode of the season. DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson argued that it was not as funny as some of the other episodes that have poked fun at nations. He added that the episode &quot;musters the occasional laugh, and like much of [season thirteen], it&#x27;s not a bad show, but it&#x27;s not a memorable one either.&quot; DVD Verdict&#x27;s Jennifer Malkowski cited the scrapbook Homer made of his kidnapping memories as the highlight of the episode.

===Reaction in Brazil===
&quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; was met with a negative reception in Brazil shortly after its broadcast in the United States. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;an immediate media frenzy was born&quot; as the episode started receiving coverage in local newspapers and news programs on Brazilian television. An article published in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; on April 8, 2002, stated that critics in the country were upset by the inclusion of clichés and stereotypes not related to Brazil, such as Brazilians having Spanish accents and wearing mustaches. The general Brazilian perception was that the episode mixed up their culture with that of surrounding Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Alex Bellos, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s correspondent in Brazil, commented that one of the things upsetting the Brazilians was the many inaccuracies featured in the episode, such as the conga and the macarena supposedly being popular dances in Brazil; the conga is actually a Caribbean dance, and the macarena does not come from Brazil nor is it frequently performed there. Roberto Pereira, an official at the city&#x27;s Center of Sexual Education, stated to the foreign press association. &quot;Americans think we are inferior, ignorant, perverted, dirty animals!&quot;

On April 6, 2002, it was reported by the Brazilian media that Riotur, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro, was planning on suing Fox for damaging the international image of the city. Riotur stated that Rio de Janeiro was portrayed in &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and a rat infestation, and it was thought that this would discourage foreign visitors from visiting the city. Over a period of three years up to the airing of &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; in the United States, Riotur had spent US$18 million on a campaign to attract tourists to Rio de Janeiro, and believed the campaign would be undermined by the portrayal of the city in the episode. Riotur&#x27;s planned lawsuit was supported by the Brazilian government, with president Fernando Henrique Cardoso stating that the episode &quot;brought a distorted vision of Brazilian reality&quot;.

Martin Kaste, South America correspondent for National Public Radio, reported on April 9, 2002, that since their announcement that they were going to sue Fox, the Riotur officials had been told by their lawyers in the United States that doing so there would be difficult because of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; executive producer James L. Brooks soon issued a statement saying: &quot;We apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro. And if that doesn&#x27;t settle the issue, Homer Simpson offers to take on the president of Brazil on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot;.&quot; Spokespersons for Fox told the press that they had not received nearly as much criticism with previous episodes that poked fun at other nations. Showrunner Al Jean has said in an interview that &quot;Every other place has had a good sense of humor. Brazil caught us by surprise.&quot; When &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; eventually aired in Brazil in December 2002, there was a statement at the beginning noting that Fox is not responsible for the vision of the producers behind the episode.

A later episode, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Live Like a Referee&quot;, has the family visiting Brazil again.

<doc id="1317169" wikidata="Q6670931" url="?curid=1317169" title="London Underground O and P Stock">
<text>The London Underground O and P Stock electric multiple units were used on the London Underground from 1937 to 1981. O Stock trains were built for the Hammersmith &amp; City line, using metadyne control equipment with regenerative braking, but the trains were made up entirely of motor cars and this caused technical problems with the traction supply so trailer cars were added. P Stock cars were built to run together with the O Stock cars now surplus on Metropolitan line Uxbridge services. The trains had air-operated sliding doors under control of the guard; the O Stock with controls in the cab whereas the P Stock controls in the trailing end of the motor cars. The P Stock was introduced with first class accommodation, but this was withdrawn in 1940.

In the early 1950s, some Uxbridge O and P Stock trains were transferred to the Circle line. The increasingly unreliable metadynes were replaced and the converted trains became known as CO/CP stock. In the early 1960s, the remaining Uxbridge CO/CP Stock trains were transferred to the District line, so that during the 1960s generally Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle line services were operated by CO stock and CP stock was used on the District line. Following the introduction of C69 Stock in the early 1970s, all CO and CP Stock trains were used on the District line until they were replaced by the C Stock and D Stock trains, with the last train running in service in 1981.

==Construction==
In 1934, an experimental six-car train was built using a multiple-unit train control system developed by Metropolitan Vickers. The metadyne equipment controlled four traction motors on two cars and allowed for regenerative braking, although air braking was fitted for low speeds and if the traction supply was unreceptive to the regenerated current.

As part of the 1935–40 New Works Programme, the O stock, sets of two motor cars, was built for the Hammersmith &amp; City line. The Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (GRC&amp;W) and the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&amp;W) built 116 cars, allowing 19 six-car trains and a spare two-car set. The new trains entered service as a four-car train between High Street Kensington and Putney Bridge on 13 September 1937 and a full-length six car train later entering service on 10 December on the Hammersmith &amp; City line. The guard&#x27;s position was in the cab, continuing the practice of the Metropolitan Railway. Technical problems were found with the traction supply with trains made up entirely of motor cars and 58 trailer cars were ordered from Gloucester and the trains reformed into three car sets. The first reformed train went into service on 18 July 1938, and 19 O Stock sets were transferred to the Metropolitan line.

With O Stock cars available, 73 sets of P stock were ordered for the Metropolitan line. Six and eight car trains were needed, so six car trains were made up from two three car units formed of two driving motor cars and a trailer and eight cars by adding a two car unit. The guard&#x27;s position on the P Stock was at the inner ends of the motor cars, as the cabs on eight car trains could still be in tunnel at stations with short platforms. The O Stock units, with the guard position in the cab, were split up and motor cars placed in the centre of the six car trains so that the door controls in these cabs were not needed. Six P1 motor cars were built without door controls and ran in the same position. Although a train could be made up from O and P Stock cars, and the units had automatic couplers on the outer ends of the motor cars, the metadynes were not interchangeable. The first P Stock train entered service on 17 July 1939. Six-car O Stock trains operated on the Hammersmith &amp; City service, and the mixed O and P Stock trains provided the services to Uxbridge.

==Description==

The long O Stock cars were fitted with air operated doors under the control of the guard. A car had 40 seats and two tip up and access was by two double doors and a single door on each side. Externally, the cars had side panels that flared at the bottom with no running boards to prevent passengers jumping on a moving train and attempting to open a door. The trailers, with four extra seats, had a hinged door at one end, locked closed in normal use, so they could be converted into driving motor cars. Lighting was provided by incandescent bulbs in the ceiling.

==War time losses==
During World War II several cars were lost. 14199 (P stock DM) was destroyed at Neasden on 27 September 1940, 13036, 14042, 14049 (all O stock DM), 13229, 14229 (all P Stock DM), 014080 (O stock trailer) at Moorgate station on 29 December 1941, and 14263 (P stock DM) at Baker Street on 10 May 1941. To make up for the number of &#x27;D&#x27; end DMs (14xxx) cars destroyed, three &#x27;D&#x27; end trailer cars were rebuilt into DMs. These were 014270-014272 which were renumbered 14270-14272 when converted. DM 14233 was damaged during bombing and one end of the car was destroyed. This was repaired using an end of Q38 Stock trailer 013167, which had also been badly damaged. The rebuilt car entered service renumbered 14233 in 1941; it became 54233 in 1963.

==Reconstruction into CO/CP Stock==
In the early 1950s, F Stock was transferred to the Metropolitan line Uxbridge service, and some O and P Stock, reformed into 5-car trains transferred to replace the trains on the Circle line; these began running in 1947. Because of the reliability of the metadynes and difficulties repairing them, one Circle line train was converted to use the pneumatic camshaft control (PCM) equipment used on the 1938 tube stock and entered service in March 1955. This was considered a success and the other Circle line trains were converted, followed by the units that operated the Hammersmith &amp; City services. The converted trains were known as CO/CP stock, and the trailers COP stock. In 1959/60, the length of the Circle line trains was increased to six cars with the addition of converted Q38 trailers, and with similar trains running on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines maintenance for the stock for the two lines was concentrated at Hammersmith depot, allowing Neasden depot to specialise in the new A Stock.

In the early 1960s, the remaining O and P Stock trains that operated the Uxbridge service, still with their metadyne controls, were converted and transferred to the District line as the second batch of A Stock was introduced. In the 1960s the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle line services were generally operated by CO stock and CP stock used on the District line. In the early 1970s, the introduction of the C69 Stock allowed the CO Stock to be transferred to the District line and instead of running 6-car trains off-peak and 8-cars during peak hours, trains were reformed into standard 7-car trains, except on the Edgware Road - Wimbledon services, where 6-car trains continued to operate due to short platforms.

=== Experiments ===

In 1967, London Underground experimented with injection moulded plastic seats in the centre of CP Stock trailer 014082, in an attempt to address the then-emerging problem with vandalism. The London Underground did not pursue the idea further, because passengers considered them to be uncomfortable, but vandal-resistant plastic seats became common on many metro systems, such as Algiers, Barcelona (TMB lines), New York City and Shanghai. Trailer 014082 kept the plastic seats until it was scrapped in 1971.

==Withdrawal and preservation==
The introduction of C77 stock on the Edgware Road services in the late 1970s allowed some CO/CP Stock cars to be scrapped, and from January 1980 the remainder was replaced by new D78 stock. The last trains ran in service in 1981, when two six-car trains operated special workings.

One complete unit DM 53028, T 013063 and DM 54233 has been preserved at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The driving motor 54233 was the one that was rebuilt using one end of a Q38 trailer in 1941. 

A DM 54256 was also preserved at the Walthamstow Pumphouse Museum but moved to Whitwell &amp; Reepham railway station after a clearout of many of the museum&#x27;s items, and now is privately owned in an undisclosed location in Essex. 

Vehicles 53028 and 013063 are CO Stock and 54233 and 54256 are CP Stock.

==Numbering==
As built the numbers were as follows:

Cars 13264 - 13269 were designated P1 stock.

<doc id="1317174" wikidata="Q16978751" url="?curid=1317174" title="Girls About Town (EP)">
<text>Girls About Town is the debut EP by the American rock band The Smithereens. It was released on 31 October 1980 on the band&#x27;s own D-Tone Records. The EP contains four songs with the word ‘girl‘ in the title, including &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Tell Me,&quot; a song originally recorded by The Beach Boys.

The 7&quot; EP has never been available in any other format, though two of its tracks were included on Smithereens compilation albums: the title track on &quot;Attack of The Smithereens&quot; and &quot;From Jersey It Came! The Smithereens Anthology&quot;; and &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on &quot;Covers&quot;.

==Background==
“We had a bunch of songs with ‘girl’ in the title, and &quot;Girls About Town&quot; was the song that everyone thought was our best live song. It was the song that we thought, at the time, had the most commercial potential, so we called the EP &quot;Girls About Town&quot; and to round it off, we made it an EP that featured the word ‘girl’ in all four songs.” -Pat DiNizio

==Track listing==
All songs written by Pat DiNizio, except &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; by Brian Wilson.
# &quot;Girls About Town&quot; 
# &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;

<doc id="1317181" wikidata="Q1212828" url="?curid=1317181" title="The Gift (Nabokov novel)">
<text>The Gift () is Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s final Russian novel, and is considered to be his farewell to the world he was leaving behind. Nabokov wrote it between 1935 and 1937 while living in Berlin, and it was published in serial form under his pen name, Vladimir Sirin.

&quot;The Gift&#x27;s&quot; fourth chapter, a pseudo-biography of the Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, was censored from publication in the Russian émigré journal &quot;Sovremennye zapiski&quot; that published the book&#x27;s four other chapters.

The story&#x27;s apparent protagonist is Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, a Russian writer living in Berlin after his family fled the Bolshevik Revolution. Fyodor&#x27;s literary ambitions and his development as a writer shape the book. In the fifth and final chapter, Fyodor states his ambition to write a book that in description is very similar to &quot;The Gift&quot;. In an interview to BBC2, Nabokov cited Fyodor as an example that not all the lives of his characters are grotesque or tragic; he said that Fyodor &quot;is blessed with a faithful love and an early recognition of his genius&quot;.

It is possible to interpret the book as metafiction and imagine that the book was actually written by Fyodor later in his life, though this is not the only possible interpretation.

Nabokov&#x27;s son, Dmitri, translated the book&#x27;s first chapter into English; Michael Scammell completed the rest. Nabokov then revised the translations of all five chapters in 1961.

==Plot==
===Chapter one===
Fyodor Konstantinovitch Cherdyntsev (in Russian version the main character is called Fyodor Konstantinovitch Godunov-Cherdyntsev, the first part of the name refers to Pushkin&#x27;s play &quot;Boris Godunov)&quot; is a Russian émigré living in Berlin in the 1920s, and the chapter starts with him moving to a boarding-house on Seven Tannenberg Street. He has recently published a book of poems and receives a call from Alexander Yakovlevich Chernyshevski congratulating him on the poems and inviting him to come over to a party to read a favorable critique in a newspaper. The poems reach back to Fyodor&#x27;s childhood, which he spent with his sister Tanya in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg and the Leshino manor, the country estate of the Godunov-Cherdyntsevs. Fyodor arrives at the party only to learn that he has fallen victim to a crude April fool&#x27;s joke; his book has not received any attention at all in the press. The Chernyshevskis had a son, Yasha, who looked like Fyodor and loved poetry. Yasha took his own life when he was caught in a tragic love triangle. Yasha&#x27;s mother wants Fyodor to use Yasha&#x27;s tragic end in his writings, but he declines. As a result of Yasha&#x27;s death, his father suffers episodes of insanity. When Fyodor returns to his “new hole”, he realises that he has brought the wrong keys with him, but after he waits a while, a visitor comes out, and Fyodor gets back in. Fyodor dawdles away the summer. In the fall he attends a literary meeting of Russian émigrés and meets Koncheyev, whom he considers a rival. A reading of a new play bores the audience. When Fyodor is about to leave, he and Koncheyev discuss Russian literature at length and with great animation, but their discussion turns out to have been largely fictitious.

===Chapter two===
Fyodor is dreaming about his native Russia as he rides in a tramcar to visit his language student, but he can no longer stand it and returns to his lodgings. When his mother, Elizaveta Pavlovna, comes from Paris to visit him, the shadow of his lost father hangs over their encounter, for his mother believes that her husband is still alive. Before her departure they attend a local Russian literary event, and Fyodor is the last poet there to recite one of his poems. Although almost unnoticed, he is inspired by his mother&#x27;s visit and by his study of Pushkin, and he seeks her support for his new project, a book about his father, Konstantin Kirillovich. He collects material, stumbles upon Sushoshchokov&#x27;s account of his grandfather, Kirill Ilyich, a gambler who made and lost a fortune in America before returning to Russia, and he starts to focus on his father&#x27;s activities as an explorer, lepidopterist, and scientific writer, whose journeys between 1885 and 1918 led him to Siberia and Central Asia. Fyodor had only come along with his father on local trips, but he is imbued with the love of butterflies and imagines accompanying his father in his journeys to the East. In 1916 his father departed for his last journey and remains missing. Fyodor&#x27;s difficulty with his project is complicated by his need to find a new lodging. With the help of Mrs. Chernyshevski he finds a place with the Shchyogolevs. He moves in with them because he sees a short, pale-blue dress in an adjacent room and assumes that it belongs to their daughter.

===Chapter three===
This chapter starts by describing a day in the life of the protagonist. In the morning Fyodor hears the Shchyogolevs get up and he begins the day by thinking about poetry. He reflects on his development as a poet. At mid-day he joins the family for lunch. Shchyogolev is talking about politics, his wife, Marianna Nikolavna, is cooking, and Marianna&#x27;s daughter, Zina Mertz, is behaving in a distinctly hostile manner. In the afternoon Fyodor gives his tutorial lessons and visits a bookstore, where he comes across Koncheyev&#x27;s book of poems &quot;Communication&quot; and some reviews that failed to understand it. He also reads an article about Chernyshevski and Chess in the Soviet chess magazine &quot;8x8&quot; and afterwards visits his editor, Vasiliev. After returning home and having supper in his room, Fyodor goes out to meet Zina in secret. While waiting for her he composes a poem embedded in the narrative. Zina Mertz has already appeared in the narrative she bought one of the few copies of Fyodor&#x27;s poems, and she is the daughter of Marianna Nikolavna and Shchyogolev&#x27;s stepdaughter, occupying the room next to Fyodor&#x27;s. The story of their encounters is recalled, and we learn that Zina knew of Fyodor when he lived at his previous lodgings. Their meetings are held in secret and hidden from her parents. Shchyogolev implies that he married her mother to gain access to Zina, and this may be the reason why she hates him. Zina works for a law firm &quot;Traum, Baum, and Kaesebier&quot;. Fyodor gets more involved with Chernyshevski&#x27;s work and declares that he wants to write about him for “firing practice”. He reads everything written by and about him, and he passes from “accumulation to creation”. Zina is Fyodor&#x27;s muse and reader. The first publisher to whom Fyodor submits his manuscript rejects it as a “reckless, antisocial, mischievous improvisation”. But Fyodor has better luck with another publisher.

===Chapter four===
This chapter, a book within a book, titled &quot;The Life of Chernyshevski&quot;, is Fyodor&#x27;s critical biography of the 19th-century Russian writer Chernyshevsky. Fyodor ridicules Chernyshevsky&#x27;s aesthetics and his understanding of literature.

===Chapter five===
The book about Chernyshevski finds itself in a “good, thundery atmosphere of scandal which helped sales”. Most reviews in the literary world of the émigrés are critical, as the book debunks its subject as a writer and thinker; Koncheyev’s review, however, is quite positive. Fyodor is unable to show the book to Alexander Yakovlevich Chernyshevski, who recently died. His death and funeral are described. On his way home, Fyodor walks with the writer Shirin, “a deaf and blind man with blocked nostrils”. Shirin tries to engage Fyodor in the activities of the Committee of the Society of Russian Writers in Germany. Fyodor declines but attends some meetings observing the infighting for control of the society. Shchyogolev is offered a job in Copenhagen and plans to leave Zina in the Berlin apartment. Fyodor is elated and takes a walk in the Grunewald forest, where he imagines to have a talk with Koncheyev. His clothes, including the key to the apartment, get stolen, and he has to return in his bathing trunks. At night he dreams that his father has come back. Next morning the Shchyogolevs leave for Copenhagen, and Zina stays behind. Fyodor, who is planning to write a &quot;classical novel&quot; (&quot;The Gift&quot;), and Zina can now live together. They are without money, both at the moment have lost the key to their apartment, but they are happy, they feel that fate brought them together, and Zina declares that he will be “a writer as has never been before“.

== Background ==
&quot;The Gift&quot; is the last novel written by Nabokov in his native language. In the 1962 foreword, he indicates that it was written between 1935 and 1937 in Berlin, with the last chapter completed on the French Riviera in 1937. The novel was first published serially in the Parisian émigré magazine &quot;Sovremennye zapiski&quot;; however, chapter four was rejected: ”a pretty example of life finding itself obliged to imitate the very art it condemns”. The complete novel was not published until 1952.

== Author&#x27;s comments ==
=== 1962 foreword ===
Despite the many parallels Nabokov tells the reader not to confuse “the designer with the design”, insisting that he is not Fyodor, his father not an explorer of Asia, and he “never wooed Zina Mertz“. Fyodor&#x27;s disdain for Germany may have been influenced by the “nauseous dictatorship” Nabokov experienced when writing. The novel evokes the close-knit and short-lived world of Russian émigré writers in post World War I Europe, notably Berlin, a “phantasm” when Nabokov wrote his foreword where he indicates:
=== Father&#x27;s Butterflies ===
Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Father&#x27;s Butterflies&quot; is viewed as a later written afterword to &quot;The Gift&quot;. It was translated by his son and published posthumously, incorporated as a chapter into &quot;Nabokov&#x27;s Butterflies&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Gift&quot; is considered by some &quot;the most original, unusual and interesting piece of prose writing&quot; of Russian emigre writing (Simon Karlinsky) and the most &quot;difficult&quot; of Nabokov&#x27;s Russian novels. Initially the complex novel was not successfully received; it was either ignored or criticized as an incendiary attack on Russian literature. Earlier critics viewed it as a novel describing the development of an artist. Dolinin, instead, sees it as &quot;a kind of declaration of love&quot; love of the creator for his creature, and of the creature for its creator, love of a son for his father, love of an exile for his native land, love for language and those who love it, love for the beauty of the world, and, last but not least, love for its readers&quot;. Johnson maintains that the theme of &quot;The Gift&quot; is the gift of art that is played out, like a chess game, along two plot lines Fyodor&#x27;s artistic development and his relationship to Zina. The role of keys in the novel acts as a leitmotif. Many other motifs are present, including time, reality, nature, love, parents, Russia, literature, art, death, light, colors, dreams, travel, and exile. The novel contains embedded literature such as poems and the paradox of a &quot;real&quot; biography by an &quot;unreal&quot; writer. The narration weaves between first and third person, time between now and past, and dreams have the quality of reality. The novel is written in a circular fashion, like a Moebius strip (Dolinin), at its end the narrator/protagonist decides to write the novel the reader is reading. Ben-Amos analyzed the role of literature in the novel, stating that it is &quot;a central component, rather than a reflection, of reality&quot;, consistent with Fyodor being both narrator and protagonist, also the love of Zina and Fyodor is inter-related to literature and unthinkable without it. Similarly, Paperno indicates that literature and reality interact on equal footing and are interchangeable.
Another angle is provided by Boyd, who suggests that &quot;The Gift&quot; depicts Fyodor&#x27;s father&#x27;s life as a thesis &quot;not quite yet earned&quot;, the life of Chernishevsky a life of frustration its Hegelian antithesis, and Fyodor&#x27;s life as it plays out the synthesis: Fyodor realizes that his past frustrations are part of a larger design to link him to Zina and to develop his art.

Each chapter follows the style of a figure of Russian literature. There is a chapter written in Pushkin&#x27;s style, one in Gogol style, and the fourth chapter is in the style of Russian satirist Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin.

<doc id="1317186" wikidata="Q846179" url="?curid=1317186" title="Significant Other (album)">
<text>Significant Other is the second studio album by American nu metal band Limp Bizkit. It was released on June 22, 1999, through Flip and Interscope Records. It saw the band expand their sound from that of their 1997 debut &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; to incorporate further metal and hip hop influences, but with a more melodic and less hardcore punk-influenced sound.

&quot;Significant Other&quot; received high commercial sales, peaking at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band&#x27;s distinctive sound and performance, which was thought to be an improvement over the band&#x27;s debut, received positive reviews from the critics. At least 16 million copies of the album have been sold worldwide.

==Production==
Following the radio success of the band&#x27;s cover of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;, the band was determined to record the follow-up to their first album in order to show that they weren&#x27;t a &quot;Korn ripoff&quot; or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame. Producer Terry Date, known for working with Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen by Limp Bizkit to produce &quot;Significant Other&quot;. Guitarist Wes Borland stated of Date&#x27;s production, &quot;he doesn&#x27;t get overly involved at the &#x27;music&#x27; end of things. He&#x27;s a producer who fools with sound and sonically makes everything perfect. He gets sounds that translate really well on tape and pretty much completely captures what we do, perfectly.&quot; The band immediately began recording after the conclusion of the Family Values Tour, despite the insistence of Interscope Records that the band take a break after it.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Significant Other&quot; has been described as a nu metal and rap metal album. An early version of &quot;I&#x27;m Broke&quot; was recorded for &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall$&quot;, but was left off the album because of how different the song sounded from the rest of that album&#x27;s material. The melody for &quot;Trust?&quot; originated from a melody played in rough form in early 1998, during the Ladies Night in Cambodia tour. In response to claims that the lyrics of &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall$&quot; were misogynistic, Fred Durst, member of Limp Bizkit, toned down his lyrical content on this album, which he described as being more lyrically mature. Durst&#x27;s breakup with his girlfriend inspired the songs &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;.

Significant Other is Borland&#x27;s first attempt at using a 7-string guitar, which was inspired by Korn. He was officially endorsed by Ibanez and owned several rare models to record the album including the RG7 CST. He also used a customized Ibanez Musician MC150PW to fit only four strings, creating a baritone guitar to record &quot;Nookie.&quot; Sometime in 2000, Borland ended his endorsement with Ibanez and reverted back to using 6-string guitars when recording the next album &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.&quot;

The band allowed Durst and DJ Lethal to explore their hip hop influences by recording with Method Man. DJ Premier of Gang Starr was brought in to produce the collaboration. The band wanted to record &quot;a track that was straight hip-hop&quot;, according to Borland. The song was originally titled &quot;Shut the Fuck Up&quot;, but was retitled &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; for marketing purposes. Durst also recorded a song with Eminem, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, which was left off the album. Durst also recorded a song with System of a Down&#x27;s vocalist Serj Tankian named &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Off Wandering&quot;. Serj&#x27;s vocals only appeared on the demo version of the song where he sang the bridge and ending chorus but his vocals don&#x27;t appear on the album version of the song. The band also collaborated with Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis and Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots on &quot;Nobody Like You&quot;. Weiland would frequently visit NRG Recording Studios and help with the recording, vocally coaching Durst. Staind singer Aaron Lewis provided backup vocals on the song &quot;No Sex&quot;, while Scott Borland, Wes&#x27; brother, played keyboards on &quot;Just Like This&quot;, &quot;Nookie&quot;, &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Broke&quot;, &quot;9 Teen 90 Nine&quot; and &quot;A Lesson Learned&quot;. The song &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Indigo Flow&quot; from &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall$&quot;. &quot;A Lesson Learned&quot; is a psychedelic trip hop track similar to &quot;Everything&quot; from &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall$&quot;.

Describing the album&#x27;s music, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that it contains &quot;flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers and there are swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background.&quot; While the band was opposed to solos, they allowed John Otto to perform an extended drum solo in the middle of &quot;Nobody Like You&quot;. Scott Borland wrote string melodies for &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Off Wandering&quot;.

The band also recorded interludes featuring celebrity cameos. The first was &quot;Radio Sucks&quot; with MTV VJ Matt Pinfield, in which he rants about &quot;pre-fabricated sorry excuses for singers and musicians who don&#x27;t even write their own songs&quot; before praising Bizkit for helping launch a musical revolution. The second, &quot;The Mind of Les&quot; featured Primus bass player and singer Les Claypool in what begin as an album intro. Claypool stated, &quot;I came in and they wanted me to write some sort of intro for the record. I got stoned and got in front of the mic and started babbling and they ended up not using the intro and using that instead.&quot;

==Cover art==
The album cover depicts a hooded individual with a microphone (supposedly extra-terrestrial) donning Fred Durst&#x27;s notorious red Yankees cap and striking a mean pose. American artist Mear One created the cover by painting it on a wall as graffiti. A time-lapse video of the process is featured in the enhanced CD version of &quot;Significant Other.&quot;

Since its inception, the hooded figure is often being used as the band&#x27;s logo as seen in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Results May Vary&quot; and 2021&#x27;s &quot;Still Sucks&quot; albums.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Significant Other&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne wrote, &quot;&quot;Significant Other&quot; isn&#x27;t simply modern rock; it&#x27;s postmodern rock.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention and noted the songs &quot;Just Like This&quot; and &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; as highlights of the album, writing, &quot;Give their image credit for having a sound.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album &quot;considerably more ambitious and multi-dimensional&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall$&quot;.

In later reviews of the album, About.com&#x27;s Tim Grierson gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;A buzz saw of bad attitude, metal guitar and white-boy rapping, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Significant Other&quot;, is unapologetically rude and immature. But perhaps more importantly, it also rocks very, very hard.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and its album guide awarded the album three and a half out of five stars. A less favorable notice came from author Martin C. Strong, who gave the album 5 out of 10 stars in his book &quot;The Essential Rock Discography&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine said &quot;Significant Other&quot; was &quot;one of the great guilty-pleasure hard-rock albums of all time&quot;, and listed it as one of ten essential nu metal albums &quot;you need to own.&quot;

In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Significant Other&quot; climbed to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies. The band promoted the album by appearing at Woodstock 1999 and headlining the year&#x27;s Family Values Tour. Durst directed music videos for the songs &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; and &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot;.

==Controversy==
Violent action sprang up during and after Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance at Woodstock 1999, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert. Durst stated during the concert, &quot;People are getting hurt. Don&#x27;t let anybody get hurt. But I don&#x27;t think you should mellow out. That&#x27;s what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick &#x27;em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy&quot;. Durst later stated in an interview, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anybody getting hurt. You don&#x27;t see that. When you&#x27;re looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you&#x27;re performing, and you&#x27;re feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?&quot; Claypool told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is &#x27;no press is bad press&#x27;, so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he&#x27;s a great guy.&quot;

Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event&#x27;s controversy. He later stated that the promoters of Woodstock &#x27;99 were at fault for booking his band, due to their reputation for raucous performances. While the performance was the subject of much controversy, the violence did not affect sales of &quot;Significant Other&quot;. The video for &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; would refer to the controversy, with the band being subjected to a fictitious court trial over the events of the concert.

<text>Beauty and Sadness is the second EP by The Smithereens, released in June 1983 on Little Ricky Records.

==Background==
For &quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot;, The Smithereens enlisted producer Alan Betrock and engineer James A. Ball to handle the production at New York&#x27;s Record Plant. Betrock had previously worked on early efforts by Blondie and Marshall Crenshaw, while Ball&#x27;s credits included albums by John Lennon and The Go-Go&#x27;s.

The first session took place on October 29, 1982, where the band completed the basic tracks and some overdubs for the title track. The band then played gigs to finance the completion of an EP and regrouped in January 1983 to record three more songs. Over several months&#x27; time the band played more gigs to pay for studio time until the EP was completed. With some spare studio time the title track was remixed into an extended version for fun.

&quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot; was released in the summer of 1983 on Little Ricky Records, an offshoot of the record mail order company Disques Du Monde. It was originally released in a limited edition of 3000 copies that soon sold out.

==Reissues==
&quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot; was remixed by Ed Stasium in November 1987 and reissued by Enigma in 1988 with one track removed from the track listing and a different track order. It was reissued again in 1992 by Capitol Records with the 1988 remix and the original track listing.

==Review==
The Smithereens showed a lot of growth in their sound, thanks to playing around the New Jersey area as well as serving as the backing band for Otis Blackwell. The disc showed off their developing &quot;Beatles meets AC/DC&quot; style, particularly in the title track, an homage to The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot;

The Beauty and Sadness EP received a four-star rating from Rolling Stone magazine.

<doc id="1317206" wikidata="Q1945434" url="?curid=1317206" title="Anjar, Gujarat">
<text>Anjar is a town, township and municipality of the Kachchh district (Kutch)in the state of Gujarat, India. Founded in 650 AD, Anjar is a culturally diverse town of historic importance in the region. It is home to several historic religious temples, including the Jesal-Toral Shrines built in honour of a fourteenth century couple, whose lives inspired works of art and cinema. The town was devastated by several earthquakes, including the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake and 2001 Gujarat earthquake. In recent years, Anjar has become a hub of manufacturing activity.

==History==

The foundation and early history of the town is unclear, due to a lack of written evidence and documentation. Popular folklore suggests a group of settlers led by Ajay Pal Chauhan (also called Ajepal) – the brother of the king of neighbouring Ajmer – arrived in Anjar in 650 AD (Samvat 707). At different points in history, the town was ruled by the Chauhan, Chaulukya, Vaghela and Chawda, as well as the Jadeja, who gained control of the entire Kutch region. The town was declared the capital of the Kingdom of Kutch by King Khengarji I in 1545, and was fortified by Deshalji II in the early eighteenth century. The fort wall was sixteen feet high and six feet thick.

Anjar was gifted to Fateh Muhammad in 1800, who extended the town&#x27;s trading routes by establishing the Tuna Port. The town was attacked by Colonel East of the British East India Company on 25 December 1815, with Tuna being occupied the following day. The fort and dependent villages were colonised by the British over the following year, with British rule imposed there until 1822. The town suffered massively from the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake, which destroyed or damaged thousands of homes and caused thousands of deaths. The population fell shortly afterwards to about 10,000. In 1822, the East India Company transferred the region back to the Jadeja clan in exchange for an annual fee. The payments were a burden on the local treasury, and the entire burden (including arrears) was paid on its behalf by the British government. The Fortification of town which was destroyed by 1819 earthquake was rebuilt by order of Rao Deshalji in 1826 by Jagmal Peetamber, who was head-workman from Maistry clan By 1901, the population of the town had increased to 18,014.

Since the earthquake of 1819, Anjar has endured several other major earthquakes. The town was the epicenter of the 1956 Anjar earthquake, which destroyed approximately 1,350 homes and killed around 115 people, injuring hundreds more. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake caused large scale devastation in Anjar. The earthquake resulted in the destruction of the entirety of the &quot;old town&quot; district. 143 people were killed in a single incident when the buildings on both sides of a narrow laneway collapsed on to students as they were celebrating Republic Day. Around 2,000 people died in Anjar as a result of the earthquake, and over 6,000 families were made homeless. According to official estimates, between 13,805 and 20,023 people died – and over 166,000 people were injured – in the Kutch region as a result of the earthquake. The region was drastically redeveloped following the 2001 earthquake.

==Demography==
As of the 2011 Indian census, the total population of Anjar is almost 150,000, with a male—female ratio of approximately 90%: 78,000 male to 70,000 female.

==Geography==

Anjar is located at and has an average elevation of . The land is mainly dry, arid flatland. In the late 19th century, the town was greatly dependent on well irrigation for its water supply, and was listed in the 1878 and 1911 editions of &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; as being only north of the Gulf of Kutch. However, the town is nearly away from the gulf, and is also south of the Great Rann of Kutch, a seasonal salt marshland.

==Climate==
Anjar is in a region classified on the Koppen-Geiger system as hot semi-arid climate, or BSh. There are three distinct seasons in Anjar: winter, summer, and the rainy season. The town can experience severe winters, which span from November to February with temperatures dropping as low as . Summer usually begins in March and lasts until July or August, with the town frequently experiencing strong heat waves. The monsoon season typically ranges from September to October, when the town experiences the majority of its yearly rainfall. On average, the region receives of rainfall per year.

==Places of interest==
===Temples and Shrines===
The Madhavrai temple is a Vaishnav shrine, with the silver-plated entrance doors bearing an inscription dated Samvat 1869 (1812 AD), presumably the year construction was completed. The temple consists of a domed hallway, a black and white marbled floor and eight pillars featuring carved images of mermaids and Nāga figures. Mohanrai&#x27;s temple is also a Vaishnav shrine, with a neatly carved wooden door and idols of Krishna with Radha and Chaturbhuj (Vishnu). The temple was extensively rebuilt from 1814 to 1824. Swaminarayan&#x27;s temple is located near the centre of the town.

Amba Mata&#x27;s shrine and the adjoining monastery were built from the fragments of older temples; the large red-stone door over the gateway features carved drawings of Devi, indicating it may have originated from a Shakta temple. The adjoining monastery belongs to the Atits of Ajepal, with an inscription of 1842 on the door. Located outside the town walls, Ajepal&#x27;s shrine is a small domed room featuring images of Ajepal on horseback and Ganesha (Ganpati).
Other temples located near the town include Kalya Mahadev&#x27;s temple, which is outside the town wall and is comparatively modern, with a dancing Yogini as its goddess. To the northwest is the Bhavani temple of Vankal Mata, and to the west the temple of Dvarkanath. Near the latter is an unfinished temple dedicated to Bahuchara Mata, with three shrines.

====Jesal-Toral shrines====
To the east of Ajepal&#x27;s monastery is a temple known locally as &quot;Jesal Toral ni Samadhi&quot;, translating to &quot;The Tomb of Jesal and Toral&quot;. It is a small tiled shed with tombs decorated with Muslim patterns sacred to the fourteenth century couple Jesal and his wife Toral. The shrine is under the care of the Ajepal monastery. Jesal&#x27;s descendants, known as the Jesar Rajputs, built shrines to the couple in each of the town&#x27;s twelve villages.

According to local history, Jester (later Jesal or Jesar) was the grandson of Jadeja Ragput leader Jam Rawal. Jesal would later become an outlaw: killing people, destroying villages and stealing cattle. Toral or Turi – a Kathi woman – was famous for composing hymns and for her devotion, as well as her beauty. She lived with an ascetic man named Sávasdhir, who did not consider Toral his wife but instead as someone who would bring salvation. The fame of her beauty reached Jesal, who unsuccessfully attempted to abduct her. After being foiled, Jesal returned to the town disguised as an ascetic, but again his plans to abduct Toral were exposed.

Confessing his plans to abduct Toral to a sect who granted a wish to every confessed sinner, Jesal was offered Toral on condition that he became ascetic. He agreed, but eventually grew tired of the constraints of asceticism, trying again to abduct Toral, who foiled his plans and over time changed Jesal into a model ascetic. Permanently settling in Anjar, Jesar died and Turi was buried alive beside his tomb. The story was the inspiration for the 1971 Gujarati film &quot;Jesal Toral&quot;.

===Buildings===

MacMurdo&#x27;s Bungalow is a state-protected monument due to the interior wall paintings depicting scenes associated with Krishna and Rama. However, the exterior of the building is now in a neglected condition.

==Cuisine==
Anjar cuisine is famous both in India and internationally. The local specialty is Dabeli, a masala-spiced mashed potato mixture served in a burger bun and garnished with pomegranate seeds or peanuts, and served with a variety of chutney. Farsan is another local delicacy. Anjar is also home to region-specific varieties of mango (Kesar Keri) and date palm fruit (Kharek). The region also produces a locally-sourced form of buttermilk known as &quot;Chhash&quot;.

==Economy==

Following the 2001 earthquake, the government in Kutch created a number of initiatives that greatly benefited the community in Anjar. Local government exempted all business operations from taxes, including excise duty and indirect tax, for five years after the earthquake. Textile company Welspun India built the largest towel factory in the world in Anjar nine months after the earthquake. The factory was producing 250,000 towels a day by 2011, when the BBC reported that the company had purchased Christy, the official towel provider of the Wimbledon Championships. A decade after the earthquake, over 110,000 jobs had been created in the Kutch province. Anjar is also one of the largest manufacturers of pipeline in the world. In 2006, the town produced over one million tonnes of pipeline, primarily for the oil, gas, water and sewage industries.

==Culture==

The people of Anjar come from a wide variety of backgrounds. The three most populous religions are Hindu, Jain and Islam. Gujarati, Kutchi and Hindi are the most commonly spoken languages. Major festivals from multiple religions are celebrated in the town, including Hindola, Navaratri, Ram Navami, Sharad Purnima, Diwali, Holi, Eid al-Fitr and Ramadan.

==Notable people==
Several members of the Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya community in Anjar made substantial contributions to the Indian railway system. Jagmal Pitambar Rathod was dubbed a &quot;Gaidher&quot; (English: &quot;Chief Architect&quot;) in 1750 by Lakhpatji, the Rao of Cutch, for his work creating the fort surrounding Anjar. Sons from three subsequent generations of Rathod&#x27;s family – who all resided in Anjar – were also awarded the &quot;Gaidher&quot; title, for their work building the forts of nearby towns Bhuj and Mandvi, as well as their work building the palaces Aina Mahal, Prag Mahal, Vijay Vilas, and the Ashapura Temple, among others. The Pamban Bridge, which links the southern island of Rameswaram to the Indian mainland, was designed by Manji Daya Vegad and Lakhu Devji Vegad, who were both born in Anjar. They also designed other railway lines in the south of India. Narshi Bechar Khodiyar, the son of Anjar-born Bechar Hardas, was given the title of honour &quot;Rai Sahib&quot; by the British in 1920, for his contributions to railway engineering.

==Villages in Anjar==
In total, there are 66 villages in the Administrative division (&quot;Taluka&quot;) of Anjar, including, among others: Amrapar, Bhalot, Chandiya, Chandroda, Devaria, Khambhra,Pantiya, Khedoi, Khokhra, Kotda Nayani, Kumbhariya, Lakhapadar, Lovariya, Meghpar, Mindiyana, Nagalpar, Pantiya, Ratnal, Sanghad, Sinugra, Tuna, Vidi and Vira.

<text>Ole Ivar Løvaas (8 May 1927 – 2 August 2010) was a Norwegian-American clinical psychologist and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is most well known for his research on what is now called applied behavior analysis (ABA) to teach autistic children through prompts, modeling, and positive reinforcement. His application of the science was also noted for its use of aversives (punishment) to reduce undesired behavior, which are no longer supported as a part of most ABA treatment plans.

Løvaas founded the Lovaas Institute and co-founded the Autism Society of America. He is also considered a pioneer of ABA due to his development of discrete trial training and early intensive behavioral intervention for autistic children.

His work influenced how autism is treated, and Løvaas received widespread acclaim and several awards during his lifetime, but also strong criticisms from many autistic self advocates and researchers supporting the autism rights movement and neurodiversity paradigm.

== Personal life ==
Løvaas was born in Lier, Norway on 8 May 1927 to Hildur and Ernst Albert Løvaas. He had two siblings: an older sister named Nora and a younger brother named Hans Erik. Løvaas attended Hegg Elementary School in Lier from 1934 to 1941. He attended junior high school at Drammen Realskole until 1944, and then moved on to Drammen Latin School for high school, graduating in 1947.

Following World War II, Løvaas moved to the United States. There he married Beryl Scoles in 1955, and together they had four children. Løvaas later divorced his wife and remarried Nina Watthen in 1986.

== Career ==
After graduating from high school, Løvaas served in the Norwegian Air Force for 18 months. He was a forced farm worker during the 1940s Nazi occupation of Norway, and often said that observing the Nazis had sparked his interest in human behavior.

He attended Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, graduating in 1951 after just one year with his B.A. in sociology. Løvaas received his Masters of Science in clinical psychology from the University of Washington in 1955, and his PhD in learning and clinical psychology from the same school 3 years later.

Early in his career, Løvaas worked at the Pinel foundation, which focused on Freudian psychoanalysis. After earning his PhD, he took a position at the University of Washington&#x27;s Child Development Institute, where he first learned of behavior analysis. Løvaas began teaching at UCLA in 1961 in the Department of Psychology, where he performed research on children with autism spectrum disorder at the school&#x27;s Neuropsychiatric Institute. He started an early intervention clinic at UCLA called the UCLA Young Autism Project, which provided intensive intervention inside the children&#x27;s homes. He was named professor emeritus in 1994. Løvaas also established the Lovaas Institute for Early Intervention (LIFE) that provides interventions based on his research.

Løvaas taught now prominent behaviorists, such as Robert Koegel, Laura Schreibman, Tristram Smith, Doreen Granpeesheh, John McEachin, Ron Leaf, Jacquie Wynn, and thousands of UCLA students who took his &quot;Behavior Modification&quot; course during his 50 years of teaching. He also co-founded what is today the Autism Society of America (ASA), published hundreds of research articles and several books, and received many accolades for his research. Due to this research, a number of school districts have adopted his programs. His work influenced how autism is treated.

== Research ==
=== Autism intervention ===
==== Early research ====

Løvaas established the Young Autism Project clinic at UCLA in 1962, where he began his research, authored training manuals, and recorded tapes of him and his graduate students implementing errorless learning—based on operant conditioning and what was then referred to as behavior modification—to instruct autistic children. He later coined the term &quot;discrete trial training&quot; to describe the procedure, which was used to teach listener responding, eye contact, fine and gross motor imitation, receptive and expressive language, academic, and a variety of other skills. In an errorless discrete trial, the child sits at a table across from the therapist who provides an instruction (i.e., &quot;do this&quot;, &quot;look at me&quot;, &quot;point to&quot;, etc.), followed by a prompt, then the child&#x27;s response, and a stimulus reinforcer. The prompts are later discontinued once the child demonstrates proficiency. During this time, Løvaas and colleagues also employed physical aversives (punishment), such as electric shocks and slaps, to decrease aggressive and self-injurious behavior, as well as verbal reprimands if the child answered incorrectly or engaged in self-stimulatory behavior.

==== 1987 study ====
In 1987, Løvaas published a study which demonstrated that, following forty hours a week of treatment, 9 of the 19 autistic children developed typical spoken language, increased IQs by 30 points on average, and were placed in regular classrooms. A 1993 follow-up study found that 8 maintained their gains and were &quot;indistinguishable from their typically developing peers&quot;, scoring in the normal range of social and emotional functioning. His studies were limited because Løvaas did not randomize the participants or treatment groups. This produced a quasi-experiment in which he was able to control the assignment of children to treatment groups. His manipulation of the study in this way may have been responsible for the observed effects. The true efficacy of his method cannot be determined since his studies cannot be repeated for ethical reasons. A 1998 study subsequently recommended that EIBI programs be regarded with skepticism. In 1999, the United States Surgeon General&#x27;s office wrote, &quot;Thirty years of research has demonstrated the efficacy of applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and in increasing communication, learning, and appropriate social behavior&quot;, and he also endorsed the 1987 study.

==== Literature reviews ====
According to a 2007 review study in &quot;Pediatrics&quot;, &quot;The effectiveness of [EIBI] in [autism spectrum disorder] has been well-documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology and in controlled studies... in university and community settings.&quot; It further stated, &quot;Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.&quot; However, the study also recommended to later generalize the child&#x27;s skills with more naturalistic ABA-based procedures, such as incidental teaching and pivotal response treatment, so their progress is maintained.

Another review in 2008 described DTT as a &quot;&#x27;well-established&#x27; psychosocial intervention for improving the intellectual performance of young children with autism spectrum disorders...&quot; In 2011, it was found that the intervention is effective for some, but &quot;the literature is limited by methodological concerns&quot; due to there being small sample sizes and very few studies that used random assignment, and a 2018 Cochrane review subsequently indicated low-quality evidence to support this method. Nonetheless, a meta-analysis in the same journal database concludes how some recent research is beginning to suggest that because of the heterology of ASD, there are a wide range of different learning styles and that it is the children with lower receptive language skills who acquire spoken language from Løvaas&#x27; treatment. In 2023, a multi-site randomized control trial study of 164 participants indicated similar findings.

===UCLA Feminine Boy Project===
Løvaas co-authored a study with George Rekers in 1974 where they attempted to modify the behavior of feminine male children through the use of rewards and punishment with the goal of preventing them from becoming adult transsexuals. The subject of the first of these studies, a young boy at the age of 4 at the inception of the experiment, died by suicide as an adult in 2003; his family attribute the suicide to this treatment. Despite the follow-up study (which Løvaas was not involved in) writing that the therapy successfully converted his homosexuality, his sister expressed concerns that it was overly biased as &quot;he was conditioned to say that&quot;, and she read his journal, which described how he feared disclosing his sexual orientation due to his father spanking him as a child as punishment for engaging in feminine behavior, such as playing with dolls.

In October 2020, the &quot;Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis&quot; officially issued an Expression of Concern about the Rekers and Løvaas study. In the editorial accompanying the Expression of Concern, the journal discusses the damage done by the study. It emphasizes that the study inflicted personal harm upon the study&#x27;s subject and his family, as well as to the gay community, for inappropriately promoting the study as evidence that conversion therapy is effective. It also argues that the field of behavior analysis was harmed by the false portrayal that the study and the use of conversion therapy are currently representative of the field.

== Awards and accolades ==
Løvaas received praise from several organizations during his lifetime. In 2001, he was given the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology Distinguished Career Award. He received the Edgar Doll Award from the 33rd Division of the American Psychological Association, the Lifetime Research Achievement Award from the 55th Division of the American Psychological Association, and the Award for Effective Presentation of Behavior Analysis in the Mass Media by the Association for Behavior Analysis International. Løvaas also earned a Guggenheim fellowship and the California Senate Award, which is an honorary doctorate. He was named a Fellow by Division 7 of the American Psychological Association and was given the Champion of Mental Health Award by Psychology Today.

== Criticism ==
The goal of making autistic people indistinguishable from their peers has attracted significant backlash from autistic advocates. Julia Bascom of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) has said &quot;ASAN&#x27;s objection is fundamentally an ethical one. The stated end goal of ABA is an autistic child who is &#x27;indistinguishable from their peers&#x27;—an autistic child who can pass as neurotypical. We don’t think that’s an acceptable goal. The end goal of all services, supports, interventions, and therapies an autistic child receives should be to support them in growing up into an autistic adult who is happy, healthy, and living a self-determined life.&quot;

Løvaas has also been criticized for his view of autistic people in relation to other people, as he said in a statement during an interview, &quot;You start pretty much from scratch when you work with an autistic person. You have a person in the physical sense - they have hair, a nose, a mouth - but they are not people in the psychological sense.&quot;

=== Aversives ===
Løvaas is credited with popularizing the use of aversives in behavior modification, as shown in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine photo spread in 1965.

He later admitted that they were only temporarily effective and punishments became less effective over time. Eventually, Løvaas abandoned these tactics, telling CBS in a 1994 interview, &quot;These people are so used to pain that they can adapt to almost any kind of aversive you give them.&quot;

<doc id="1317211" wikidata="Q848965" url="?curid=1317211" title="Pagani Zonda">
<text>The Pagani Zonda is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani. It debuted at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. Produced on commission in limited units, as of 2019 a total of 140 cars had been built, including development mules. Variants include a 2-door coupé and roadster variant, along with a third new variant being the barchetta. Construction is mainly of carbon fibre.

The Zonda was originally to be named the &quot;Fangio F1&quot; after Formula One champion Juan Manuel Fangio, but, following his death in 1995, it was renamed for the Zonda wind, a term for a hot air current above Argentina.

==Model variants==
===Zonda C12===
The Zonda C12 debuted in 1999 at the Geneva Motor Show. It is powered by a Mercedes-Benz &quot;M120&quot; V12 engine having a power output of either or at 5,200 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm mated to a 5-speed manual transmission.

The C12 can accelerate to in 4.0 seconds and to in 9.2 seconds.

Only five cars were built with the 6.0 L engine, though the C12 was still available in 2002 when the C12 S was introduced. One was used for crash testing and homologation, while another was a demonstrator and show car. The remainder were delivered to customers during the next three years. The crash test and homologation car having chassis number 001 was restored by Pagani&#x27;s recently established restoration program called &quot;Pagani Rinascimento&quot; and was presented to the public at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show for the Zonda&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

===Zonda C12-S===
The Zonda C12-S uses a modified version of the &quot;M120&quot; V12 engine used in the C12 enlarged to . Tuned by Mercedes-AMG, the engine has a power output of and is mated to a newly developed CIMA 6-speed manual transmission in order to handle the high power output produced by the engine.

The C12-S can accelerate to in 3.7 seconds, and to in 7.0 seconds. Lateral acceleration on the skidpad is 1.18 &quot;g&quot; (11.6 m/s²). The C12-S can reach a top speed of .

===Zonda S 7.3===
Introduced in 2002 the Zonda S 7.3 used a new, larger naturally aspirated &quot;M120&quot; V12 engine displacing designed and manufactured by Mercedes-AMG having a power output of at 5,900 rpm and of torque at 4,050 rpm. To better handle the power, traction control and ABS were made standard. Performance claims were unchanged from the Zonda C12-S.

====Zonda Roadster====
In 2003, Pagani presented the Zonda Roadster, an open top version of the Zonda S 7.3. Carrying the same components as the coupé, Pagani promised no loss of performance, a claim supported by the minimal weight gain of . A total of 40 roadsters were produced.

===Zonda F===
The Zonda F (or Zonda Fangio - named after Formula One driver Juan Manuel Fangio) debuted at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. It was the most extensive re-engineered variant of the Zonda yet, though it shared much with its predecessors including the 7.3 L Mercedes-AMG &quot;M297&quot; V12 engine which through enhanced intake manifolds, exhaust and a revised ECU now had a power output of at 6,150 rpm and at 4,000 rpm. The transmission is largely the same as the C12 S but had stronger internals and differential gears. Zonda F has a top speed of .

Production of the Zonda F was limited to 25 cars. It came equipped with an extra headlight and a new configuration of fog lights in the lower grille, new bodywork (revised front end, new rear spoiler, more aerodynamic vents all around) that improved the car&#x27;s aerodynamics, and different side mirrors. Further enhancements over the &quot;S&quot; centered on optional carbon/ceramic brakes (measuring 380 mm) developed in conjunction with Brembo, OZ alloy wheels, Inconel exhaust system, hydroformed aluminium intake plenum, and a redesigned &quot;Z preg&quot; weave in the crash structure to improve rigidity and reduce weight.

====Zonda Roadster F====
The Zonda Roadster F debuted at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show. Exterior wise, the roadster was similar to the coupé, but with a removable carbon fibre roof and canvas side curtains, weighing just more than the coupé. Power output of the engine increased to and of torque. Production of the Roadster F was limited to 25 units.

The Roadster F maintained chassis rigidity without any gain in curb weight, eschewing conventional thinking by not strengthening the sills, a process which would have needed more than of reinforcement. Pagani instead used racing car materials, and construction techniques, strengthening the firewall structure of the chassis tub together with billet alloy braces that connected the points where the roof rails would have joined. The windscreen was also strengthened for safety reasons. These techniques enabled the Roadster to have virtually the same weight as the coupé, .

The Zonda Roadster F Clubsport is a lightweight version of the Zonda Roadster F. It has an extensive use of the new carbo-titanium material developed by Pagani as well as having an upgraded engine. It was tested by &quot;Top Gear&#x27;s&quot; The Stig along with James May and achieved a lap time around their test track of 1:17.8, beating the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 tested during the same episode, but lost in a quarter mile drag race against the Veyron by nearly 2.5 seconds. German racing driver Marc Basseng managed to lap the Zonda F Clubsport around the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 7:24.7.

=== Zonda R ===

In 2007, Pagani introduced the Zonda R at the Geneva Motor Show, a track-only version of the Pagani Zonda.

===Zonda Cinque=== 
The Zonda Cinque (Italian for five) was meant to be the last iteration of the Zonda, being a road-legal version of the Zonda R. Only five were built, hence the name, with deliveries set to June 2009 for all five cars. The Zonda Cinque was developed at the request of a Pagani dealer in Hong Kong.

The differences from other variants of the Zonda were the new 6-speed automated manual gearbox, resulting in shifts taking less than 100 milliseconds, dropping the 0– acceleration time down to 3.4 seconds. The gearbox has three driving modes, namely Comfort, Sport and Race which optimises the gearbox for different driving conditions. The Cinque also had a revised form of carbon fibre called &quot;carbo-titanium&quot; which incorporates titanium in the weave to increase strength and rigidity. The suspension used magnesium and titanium components, and the 7.3-litre engine&#x27;s power and torque were increased to and . Revised bodywork, which included a longer front splitter, new sideskirts, rear diffuser, bumper canards, and a flatter underside as well as a roof-mounted air intake scoop, enabled the Cinque to generate of down-force at and 1.45 G of cornering force.

The Zonda Cinque Roadster had the same specifications as the coupé from which it was derived. Only five units were built, like the coupé.

====Zonda Tricolore====
The Zonda Tricolore, originally conceived as a one-off before production totaled three, was built as a tribute to the Frecce Tricolori, Italy&#x27;s aerobatic team. It carried much of the body from the Zonda Cinque. The car was unpainted except for a clear blue lacquer, and red, white, and green stripes from the nose along the top of the car&#x27;s surface. Unique to this car was a small wing placed behind the cockpit which reflected the tail wing of Frecce Tricolori&#x27;s Aermacchi MB-339 PAN stunt plane. The three Tricolores were priced at £1.2 million. It was also faster than a standard Zonda at .

=== Zonda Revolución ===
In 2012 Pagani introduced the Zonda Revolución at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, an evolution of the Pagani Zonda R.

===Zonda HP Barchetta===
The Zonda HP Barchetta was unveiled at the 2017 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance as a present to the company&#x27;s founder, Horacio Pagani for his 60th birthday as well as to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the Zonda. It has unique exterior design cues which makes it different from other Zondas produced with the most distinguishable features being the barchetta body style and rear wheel covers inspired by group C race cars, making it the first Pagani to ever use this styling. It also has a rear spoiler, air intakes and rear lights taken from the 760 series cars. Power comes courtesy of the Mercedes-AMG V12 engine rated at and of torque making it the most powerful road legal Zonda ever produced. It borrows its seats and suspension from the Huayra BC along with its power output being identical to the BC with the only difference being that the BC has a Bi-turbo engine while the HP Barchetta is naturally aspirated. The wheels of the car also have different colour inlays with the wheels at the left having gold and the wheels at the right having blue inlays. Production is limited to just 3 units with one unit retained for Horacio Pagani&#x27;s personal collection. The Zonda HP Barchetta marks an end to the Zonda&#x27;s production run.

=== Zonda Revo Barchetta ===
One-off Zonda Revo combining Zonda Revolución track-focused body kit and 800 PS engine with Zonda Barchetta open-top experience.

=== Technical data (all production variants) ===
== Zonda One-off Series ==
The Zonda One-Off Series is a custom line-up built for special customers, sometimes made as rebuilds of existing (and sometimes crashed) Zonda chassis. These models have a 7.3-litre M297 engine but with a power output of and of torque.

== Racing ==

===Zonda GR===

Development of the Zonda GR started in December 2002. Tom Weickardt, owner of American Viperacing, Toine Hezemans, owner of Carsport Holland, and Paul Kumpen, owner of GLPK Racing, incorporated a new company, Carsport Zonda, to develop a racing version of the Zonda. They secured exclusive rights to develop, build and sell competition versions of the Zonda from Horacio Pagani, and the first GR was completed at Carsport&#x27;s facility in Modena within months.

The Zonda GR is based on the Zonda S. It was built on the same carbon fibre chassis, with lightweight tube frames present on the front and rear. The bodywork was modified to include front and rear diffusers and louvers for improved aerodynamics. The car was wide, in accordance with the regulations of the FIA and ACO. The car&#x27;s weight was reduced to , and a new suspension system was designed. Along with new motorsport-oriented wheels and brakes. The engine was equipped with an enlarged radiator, two air intake restrictor plates, and the engine and gearbox also had new oil coolers. The resulting engine is rated at around at 5,800 rpm and of torque at 4,300 rpm with a redline increased to 7,500 rpm. Unrestricted, however, the 7.0 L V12 engine is capable of producing around and of torque. Performance figures include a 0 to acceleration time of 3.3 seconds. 

The car was entered into the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans, but retired after ten laps due to a gearbox failure.

<text>South Lakes High School is a public high school in Reston, Virginia, United States. The school serves grades 9-12 for the Fairfax County Public Schools.

==History==
South Lakes High School opened in 1978 with grades 7-10. Students in the first 10th-grade class had attended either Herndon or Oakton High Schools for grade 9. In the 1979-80 school year, the school had grades 7-11. Langston Hughes Intermediate School was supposed to open in the fall of 1980, but there were construction delays. As a result, for the first quarter of the 1980-1981 school year, South Lakes had a split shift so intermediate school (grades 7-8) students attended in the morning and high school (grades 9-12) students attended in the afternoon. Langston Hughes opened in time for 2nd quarter. South Lakes&#x27; first graduating class was the class of 1981 (who attended the school for three years).

South Lakes underwent a $55 million renovation from winter 2006 through August 2008. The renovation was completed in time for the 2008–2009 school year. A second renovation, completed in the winter of 2018, gave the school a new wing.

<doc id="1317221" wikidata="Q29348870" url="?curid=1317221" title="Comparison of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish">
<text>Danish, Norwegian (including both written forms: Bokmål, the most common standard form; and Nynorsk) and Swedish are all descended from Old Norse, the common ancestor of all North Germanic languages spoken today. Thus, they are closely related, and largely mutually intelligible, particularly in their standard varieties. The largest differences are found in pronunciation and language-specific vocabulary, which may hinder mutual intelligibility to some extent in some dialects. All dialects of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish form a dialect continuum within a wider North Germanic dialect continuum.

== Mutual intelligibility ==
Generally, speakers of the three largest Scandinavian languages (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) can read each other&#x27;s languages without great difficulty. The primary obstacles to mutual comprehension are differences in pronunciation. According to a scientific study of the three groups, Norwegians generally understand the other languages the best, while Swedes understand the least.

Danish and Norwegian are especially comprehensible to one another. In general, Danish and Norwegian speakers will be able to understand the other&#x27;s language after only a little instruction or exposure. Traditionally educated Norwegians, and especially speakers of Urban East Norwegian, understand spoken Danish fluently; indeed Urban East Norwegian is closer to 16th century Danish than modern Danish is due to being closely influenced by the written (Danish) language, which modern spoken Danish has diverged from to a greater degree. However, due to the same reason, present-day Danish speakers generally do not understand spoken Norwegian as well as the extremely similar written norms would lead one to expect. Some Norwegians — especially in northern and western Norway — may also have problems understanding Danish.

Because Norway&#x27;s largest cities have received signals from Sweden&#x27;s two national TV channels since the 1960s through private antennas, Norwegians generally have a better grasp of Swedish than vice versa; Sweden did not receive Norwegian TV until decades later.

== Old Norse and Icelandic ==

Old Norse is a stage of development of North Germanic dialects before their final divergence into separate Nordic languages. Old Norse was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements and chronologically coincides with the Viking Age, the Christianization of Scandinavia and the consolidation of Scandinavian kingdoms from about the 8th to the 15th centuries.

The 12th-century Icelandic &quot;Gray Goose Laws&quot; state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, (&quot;Danish tongue&quot;; speakers of Old East Norse would have said &quot;&quot;). Another term was (&quot;northern speech&quot;). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, and other North Germanic varieties of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable mutual intelligibility while Icelandic remains the closest to Old Norse.

== History of Norwegian ==

In the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway (1536–1814), the official language — in the sense of written language — was Danish, not Norwegian. However it came to be seen as a common language of the kingdoms. The urban Norwegian upper class spoke Dano-Norwegian, a form of Danish with Norwegian pronunciation and other minor local differences. After the two countries separated, Danish remained the official language of Norway — although it was referred to as Norwegian in Norway — and remained largely unchanged until language reforms in the early 20th century led to the standardization of forms more similar to the Norwegian urban and rural vernaculars. Until 1907 the written language in Norway was more or less completely Danish; in the following decades various spelling reforms gradually made the language somewhat more different from Danish, although the differences are still fairly small. Since 1929, this written standard has been known as &quot;Bokmål&quot;. The other Norwegian written standard, &quot;Nynorsk&quot;, was constructed on the basis of Norwegian dialects. Attempts to bring Bokmål closer to and eventually merge it with Nynorsk have failed due to widespread resistance during the Norwegian language conflict. As part of this resistance, elites, most of the media and significant parts of the population supported an alternative spelling standard promoted by the Riksmål movement, that built on the Danish language tradition in Norway. The language struggle in Norway also had a class aspect, as the Norwegian educated elites traditionally had a strong affinity for Denmark and its culture, and thus saw the Danish written language as an important part of their identity. Until 1811 the University of Copenhagen had been the only university of Denmark-Norway, and educated Norwegians thus spent formative years in Denmark. When Norway&#x27;s university was founded in 1811 it built on and maintained close ties to a Danish academic tradition, thereby continuing the influence of Danish among elites. The most recent reforms of Bokmål from 2005 have again brought the language closer to the Danish language tradition in Norway by including most of the Riksmål tradition in official Bokmål, thereby largely ending the Norwegian language conflict.

;English translation: In 1877 Brandes left Copenhagen and took up residence in Berlin. However, his political views made Prussia an uncomfortable place to live, and in 1883 he returned to Copenhagen, where he was met by a completely new group of writers and thinkers, who were eager to accept him as their leader. The most important of his later works is his work about William Shakespeare, which was translated to English by William Archer and received recognition immediately.
== Writing system ==

=== Danish and Norwegian ===

Generally, Norwegian orthography is more simplified and regularized and closer to actual pronunciation than Danish. As a rule, the graphic differences between the two languages do not reflect actual differences in pronunciation; while there are significant phonetic and phonological differences, they are rarely expressed in writing. The few exceptions are noted below.

* In writing, Danish may employ either the letter or the letter to signify the short vowel phoneme . Norwegian almost always uses . Example: Danish (to lay), (to send) versus Norwegian , .
* Danish regularly, although not always, uses the letter combinations , instead of the double consonant letters , . In most cases this is not etymologically justified. In Norwegian and Swedish, only the etymologically justified spellings occur. Example: Danish (to know, Old Norse ), (this /common gender/, ON masculine accusative ) and (to send, ON ) versus Norwegian () / (), (but ); Danish (bad, ON ), (to want, Old Norse ) and (to hold, Old Norse ) versus Norwegian , (but () / / ()).
* Unlike Norwegian, Danish often uses instead of double . Example: (to scratch) but (certain [plural]) versus Norwegian , . Likewise in some other contexts, Danish (best), (last) versus Norwegian , (ON , , where denoted consonant combinations like etc.).
* Unlike Norwegian, Danish does not use double consonants at the end of words. Example: Danish can signify both the adjective pronounced (wise) and the adjective pronounced (certain), even though the plural forms of the adjectives, where the consonant occurs medially, are distinguished in writing by means of a double in the second word ( versus ). In contrast, Norwegian does distinguish between and in the same way as between and .
* Danish preserves the above rule both before inflexional and derivational endings beginning in a consonant and in &quot;compounding&quot;. Norwegian, too, prohibits word-final double consonants before inflexional endings beginning in a consonant (unless homography needs to be avoided), but not before derivational endings and in compounding. Example: Danish (all /common gender/) – (all /neuter gender/) – (all /plural/) – (always, literally &quot;all time&quot;); Norwegian – – , but .
* Norwegian has preserved the spellings , , and in the beginning of words when followed by , , , while modern Danish has simply , and . Today, this in part reflects the fact that these words are also pronounced differently in the two languages, see below. Examples: Danish (keep, hide), (dear), (wonderful, lovely) versus Norwegian (), , .
* A pair of diphthongs are spelled as and in Danish, but as and in Norwegian. The exact pronunciation of these diphthongs is also somewhat different in the two languages, see below, and the different spellings are phonetically justified at least for the second diphthong. Examples: Danish (way), (lied /past tense/) versus Norwegian , .
* In the oblique case forms of the 1st and 2nd person pronouns and of reflexive pronouns, the &quot;ei&quot;/&quot;ej&quot; diphthong is spelled in Danish, but in Norwegian: &quot;mig&quot;, &quot;dig&quot;, &quot;sig&quot; versus &quot;meg&quot;, &quot;deg&quot;, &quot;seg&quot;.
* In Danish, the preposition &quot;af&quot; &quot;of, from&quot; is spelled with (pronounced or, in compounds, ), whereas Norwegian has &quot;av&quot; with like Swedish.
* In loanwords, Danish generally has tended to partly preserve the spelling of the source language, whereas Norwegian traditionally usually has adapted the spelling to its own rules in order to reflect the expected pronunciation. Examples: Danish &quot;bureau&quot; (bureau), &quot;chauffør&quot; (chauffeur), &quot;information&quot; (information), &quot;garage&quot; (garage), &quot;centrum&quot; (centre), &quot;zone&quot; (zone) versus Norwegian &quot;byrå&quot;, &quot;sjåfør&quot;, &quot;informasjon&quot;, &quot;garasje&quot;, &quot;sentrum&quot;, &quot;sone&quot;.
* Traditional Danish punctuation requires that a comma be placed before and after every dependent clause, and although two recent reforms permit, optionally, the dropping of a comma &quot;before&quot; the dependent clause, the old system is still in general use. In contrast, Norwegian only requires a comma &quot;after&quot; the dependent clause; a comma is placed &quot;before&quot; it only if the clause is parenthetic (the same rule as in English, but English also does not put a comma after a non-parenthetic clause). Swedish uses the same rule as English: a comma is not required before or after a non-parenthetic clause. Example where the dependent clause is parenthetic – (). Example sentence with nonparenthetic clause:

* Danish capitalizes all words in multi-word proper designations, but Norwegian and Swedish only capitalize the first word: &quot;Det Hvide Hus&quot; (Danish) – &quot;Det hvite hus&quot; (Norwegian Bokmål) – &quot;Det kvite huset&quot; (Norwegian Nynorsk) – &quot;Vita huset&quot; (Swedish) – the White House (English).

=== Swedish differences ===
Swedish orthography differs from Danish and Norwegian in the following respects:
* Danish and Norwegian use the letters and , but Swedish uses and . All the three languages use the letter .
* Danish and Norwegian use , but Swedish uses . Danish might also use a single &#x27;k&#x27; finally, even for short vowels.
* Swedish uses the letter in native words, but Danish and Norwegian use instead.
* In Swedish orthography, the etymological was abolished in 1906. Danish and Bokmål Norwegian still use it, although in some Norwegian words it is simplified to (&quot;verv, virvel, veps&quot; and optionally in &quot;verken/hverken&quot;). In Nynorsk, it is written following truly Norwegian pronunciation.
* Swedish uses , , before all front vowels like Danish, although pronounces them as palatals unlike Danish.
* Swedish, like Norwegian, mostly spells /kt/ as , whereas Danish uses &#x27;.
* Swedish uses the spelling &quot;och&quot; (and), whereas Danish and Norwegian use &quot;og&quot;.
* Use of double consonants in Swedish generally coincides with that in Norwegian, but Norwegian uses , , , , , , , , , , , and Swedish uses , , , , , , , , , , , .
* Swedish uses double consonants before , , , , , , but Norwegian uses single consonants.
* Danish and Norwegian preserve the morphological spelling , but in Swedish it was replaced by (or by after consonants and unstressed vowels) by the 1906 spelling reform.
* The use of the letter in Swedish is much more frequent than the use of in Danish, not to mention Norwegian. In particular, Swedish uses in the combination , which mostly corresponds to in Danish.
* Swedish corresponds to Danish and Norwegian or .
* Some verbs in Swedish have two infinitives: more commonly used short one and more formal long one: &quot;be/bedja, bli/bliva, ge/giva, ha/hava, ta/taga&quot;. In Norwegian, only short form is used (except &quot;be/bede&quot;); written Danish has only long form.
* Spelling of loanwords is intermediate between conservative Danish and progressive Norwegian. In particular, various spelling of and sounds are usually retained in Swedish, but replaced in Norwegian.
* Danish and Norwegian use ordinal dot for writing ordinal numbers, but Swedish uses colon and ending: &quot;5.&quot; (Danish and Norwegian), &quot;5:e&quot; (Swedish). Although ordinal dot in Swedish was formerly used, now it occurs only in military contexts, such as &quot;5. komp&quot; (5th company). Dates in Swedish are written without the ordinal suffixes, e. g. &quot;5 juni&quot;; in Danish and Norwegian the ordinal dot is used: &quot;5. juni&quot;.

== Pronunciation and sound system ==
The difference in pronunciation between Norwegian and Danish is much more striking than the difference between Norwegian and Swedish. Although written Norwegian is very similar to Danish, spoken Norwegian more closely resembles Swedish.

Danish pronunciation is typically described as &#x27;softer&#x27;, which in this case refers mostly to the frequent approximants corresponding to Norwegian, Swedish and historical plosives in some positions in the word (especially the pronunciation of the letters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;g&quot;), as well as the German-like realisation of r as a uvular or even pharyngeal approximant in Danish as opposed to the Norwegian alveolar trills or uvular trills/fricatives.

Note that in the following comparison of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish pronunciation, the East Norwegian pronunciation of Oslo is taken as the norm. In practice, most Norwegians will speak a local dialect in most contexts; furthermore, Bokmål itself is not a spoken standard, and is likely to be pronounced with clearly regional features. The most obvious instances are the uvular (rather than alveolar) pronunciation of and the lack of retroflexes in much of Western Norway, and the pronunciation, in some cases, of a retroflex flap instead of in much of Eastern Norway, including the less &quot;refined&quot; forms of the Oslo dialect. All of this is ignored in the following exposition.

=== Vowels ===
Arguably the most acoustically striking differences in vowels are that:
*In Danish, the grapheme &quot;a&quot; corresponds, in most contexts, to the pronunciation of a front, often even open-mid front vowel (), closer to the English short &quot;a&quot;. In Norwegian and Swedish, &quot;a&quot; is invariably an open back vowel . Example: Danish &quot;bane&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;bane&quot; (course, orbit).
*The grapheme &quot;u&quot; corresponds to (more or less close) &quot;back&quot; vowels in Danish, but usually to a close &quot;central&quot; vowel () in Norwegian and Swedish. Example: Danish versus Norwegian .

As a whole, Norwegian and Swedish still preserve the old pairs of short and long vowels, as suggested by the writing system, pretty close to each other, even though the long ones are usually closer. Thus, the grapheme &quot;e&quot; corresponds to long (Norwegian and Swedish &quot;sene&quot; , late [plural]) and short (Norwegian &quot;sende&quot; , to send; Swedish &quot;hetta&quot; , heat), while the grapheme &quot;i&quot; corresponds to long (Norwegian &quot;sine&quot; , Swedish &quot;sina&quot; , his/her/its/their own) and short (&quot;sinne&quot; , anger [Norwegian]/mind [Swedish]). In Danish, the tendency of differentiation has led to a qualitative overlapping: also here, &quot;e&quot; can stand for long (&quot;sene&quot; , late [plural]) and for short (&quot;sende&quot; , to send), but &quot;i&quot;, besides signifying long (&quot;sine&quot; , his/her/its/their own), has come to correspond to short (&quot;[nogen]sinde&quot; , ever) and, to complicate things further, a short pronunciation is maintained in some cases (&quot;sidste&quot; , last). Most Danish vowels have also many segmentally conditioned allophones, especially more open ones when preceded or followed by .

The following is a table that compares the most common Danish, Norwegian and Swedish pronunciations of a letter (without taking into account the grouping of sounds into phonemes, as well as many sub-rules, exceptions and subtleties). Note that in many cases, even when the same IPA transcription is used, the sounds may still be somewhat different in the three languages.
:1) before labials and velars
:2) But before 
:3) before velars
:4) But before 
:5) but, in some cases, (notably before &quot;rt&quot;, &quot;nd&quot;, and sometimes &quot;st&quot;)
:6) in some words before (&lt; older &quot;ō&quot;)
:7) almost universally before 
:8) only in &quot;fyrre&quot; &quot;40&quot;
:9) But , when, by exception, not followed by 
:10) before 
:11) before realised as and , long and short respectively.

While the more open realisations of and before are allophonic in Danish, they have acquired phonemic status as and in Norwegian, and the Norwegian letter &quot;æ&quot; has come to be used almost only to signify them. The phonologisation of was mostly a collateral effect of the merger of some other sounds: Danish &quot;æ&quot; versus &quot;e&quot; and &quot;sj&quot; versus &quot;rs&quot; have come to be pronounced in the same way in Norwegian (respectively and ), thus rendering the occurrences of unpredictable.

=== Diphthongs ===
The Danish diphthongs and (spelled as &quot;ej&quot; and &quot;øj&quot;) correspond to the Norwegian diphthongs (in Oslo pronunciation) and (spelled as &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;øy&quot;) and to Swedish and (spelled as &quot;ej&quot; and &quot;öj&quot;). Besides that, a great many letter combinations are pronounced as diphthongs in Danish, but as usual vowel-consonant combinations in Norwegian and Swedish. That is mostly due to the Danish letters &quot;g&quot; and &quot;v&quot; (colloquially also &quot;b&quot;) being pronounced as semivowels and after a vowel: thus, &quot;dag&quot; (day) is pronounced in Danish, but in Norwegian and Swedish; &quot;lov&quot; (law) is pronounced in Danish, but in Norwegian and Swedish. Similarly, and are often spelled as &quot;eg&quot; and &quot;øg&quot; in Danish (&quot;eg&quot; may be pronounced in Norwegian, too, e.g. in &quot;regne&quot;, &quot;to rain&quot;). The Danish pronunciation is therefore, as with &quot;a&quot; above, closer to English, while the Norwegian and Swedish is more conservative, closer to its spelling.

*A significant sound correspondence (rather than simply a difference in pronunciation) is the fact that Danish and Swedish have long monophthongs (&quot;e&quot; , &quot;ø&quot; ) in some words, where Norwegian has restored the reflexes of old Norse diphthongs (&quot;ei&quot; , &quot;øy&quot; and &quot;au&quot; ) as alternatives or, sometimes, replacement of the Danish ones. Examples: Danish &quot;ben&quot;, Swedish &quot;ben&quot; (leg, bone) – Norwegian &quot;ben&quot; or &quot;bein&quot;; Danish &quot;hø&quot;, Swedish &quot;hö&quot; (hay) – Norwegian &quot;høy&quot;; Danish &quot;høj&quot;, Swedish &quot;hög&quot; (hill) – Norwegian &quot;haug&quot;.
*Another correspondence: Old Norse &quot;jó&quot; and &quot;jú&quot; became &quot;ju&quot; in Swedish but &quot;y&quot; in Danish. Norwegian sometimes uses Danish forms, sometimes forms with &quot;jo&quot; and &quot;ju&quot; as in Old Norse. For example: Old Norse &quot;ljóss&quot; – Danish &quot;lys&quot; – Norwegian &quot;lys&quot; (Bokmål), &quot;lys&quot; or &quot;ljos&quot; (Nynorsk) – Swedish &quot;ljus&quot; (light).

=== Consonants ===
The most notable differences are, as already mentioned, the pronunciation of approximants in Danish, corresponding to voiced and voiceless stops in Norwegian and Swedish and of &quot;r&quot; as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant in Danish, corresponding to an alveolar trill in (East) Norwegian and Swedish (except southern dialects) (&quot;skrige&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot; versus &quot;skrike&quot;, &quot;skrika&quot;). Furthermore, Danish has replaced the voiceless/voiced opposition (in versus ) with an aspirated/nonaspirated one ( versus ), and the contrast between the two is neutralized syllable-finally and before schwa (in practice, in the core of native words, this means it is lost everywhere except word-initially). Thus, &quot;begge&quot; (both) and &quot;bække&quot; (brooks) are pronounced alike as . In Norwegian and Swedish, the opposition is still voiced versus voiceless and it is preserved everywhere, with being aspirated in the onset of a stressed syllable (as in English and German).
The Danish is either vocalized or dropped altogether, after having influenced the adjacent vowels, in all positions but word-initially and pre-stress, making the Danish &quot;r&quot; very similar to the standard German &quot;r&quot;. Also, note the Danish pronunciation of initial &quot;t&quot; as , similar to the High German consonant shift wherein German changed &quot;t&quot; to &quot;z&quot;/&quot;tz&quot; (cf. Danish &quot;tid&quot;, German &quot;Zeit&quot;).

Meanwhile, syllable-final &quot;b&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; may be compared to English syllables that end in &quot;y&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, and &quot;th&quot; (English &quot;say&quot; versus Danish &quot;sige&quot;, &quot;law&quot; versus &quot;lov&quot;, &quot;wrath&quot; versus &quot;vrede&quot;).

Some letter combinations that are pronounced quite differently are:
*&quot;rd&quot;, &quot;rl&quot;, &quot;rn&quot;, &quot;rs&quot;, &quot;rt&quot; are pronounced as spelled in Danish (with the dropped), but in the part of Norway using trilled &quot;r&quot;, they are always or almost always merged into retroflex consonants (, , , , ), as in Swedish.
*&quot;sj&quot; is pronounced in Danish, but as in most of Norway and as [] in Swedish.

Some notable sound correspondences are:
*Danish has (spelled &quot;b&quot;), (spelled &quot;d&quot;), and (spelled &quot;g&quot;) after long stressed vowels, where Norwegian and Swedish have restored/preserved the , and from Old Norse. Examples: Danish &quot;fod&quot; (foot), &quot;reb&quot; (rope), &quot;syg&quot; (sick) – Norwegian &quot;fot&quot;, &quot;rep&quot;, &quot;syk&quot;/&quot;sjuk&quot; – Swedish &quot;fot&quot;, &quot;rep&quot;, &quot;sjuk&quot; – Old Norse &quot;fótr&quot;, &quot;reip&quot;, &quot;sjúkr&quot;. In a handful of cases, however, Bokmål Norwegian has kept the Danish form (&quot;lege&quot;, doctor, &quot;tegn&quot;, sign, &quot;bedre&quot;, better versus Old Norse &quot;læknari&quot;, &quot;teikn&quot;, &quot;betri&quot;). In most of these cases, the Nynorsk equivalents have retained the old consonants (&quot;lækjar&quot; (variant form), &quot;teikn&quot;, &quot;betre&quot;).
*Sometimes Danish has (, spelled &quot;v&quot;) after originally long stressed vowels, where Norwegian and Swedish have restored/preserved from Old Norse. Example: Danish &quot;skov&quot; (forest), &quot;mave&quot; (belly) – Norwegian &quot;skog&quot;, &quot;mage&quot; – Swedish &quot;skog&quot;, &quot;mage&quot; – Old Norse &quot;skógr&quot;, &quot;magi&quot;. However, in many cases Norwegian has kept the Danish form (&quot;lyve&quot; &quot;tell a lie&quot; – Old Norse &quot;ljúga&quot;), and variation is permitted (&quot;mave&quot;, &quot;lyge&quot;, and even &quot;ljuge&quot;).
*Danish has , , and (spelled &quot;g&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;sk&quot;) in stressed syllable onsets, where Norwegian usually has , and before front vowels (spelled as in Danish before &quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;øy&quot;, and &quot;gj&quot;, &quot;kj&quot; and &quot;skj&quot; elsewhere). Examples: Danish &quot;gemme&quot; (keep, hide), &quot;kær&quot; (dear), &quot;skønt&quot; (although), &quot;gyse&quot; (shiver), &quot;kilde&quot; (source, spring) versus Norwegian &quot;gjemme&quot;, &quot;kjær&quot;, &quot;skjønt&quot;, &quot;gyse&quot;, &quot;kilde&quot; (Bokmål)/&quot;kjelde&quot; (Bokmål and Nynorsk). Swedish has , and , spelled as in Danish: &quot;gömma&quot;, &quot;kär&quot;, &quot;källa&quot;.
*Additionally, the letter &quot;g&quot; is pronounced in Swedish in the final consonant combinations &quot;-lg&quot; and &quot;-rg&quot;, but not in Danish and Norwegian.
*The consonant combinations &quot;skj&quot;, &quot;kj&quot;, &quot;tj&quot;, &quot;gj&quot; are pronounced simply as consonant clusters in Danish, but in Norwegian and Swedish they represent single consonants: Norwegian &quot;skj&quot; , &quot;kj, tj&quot; , &quot;gj&quot; ; Swedish &quot;skj&quot; , &quot;kj, tj&quot; , &quot;gj&quot; . The combinations &quot;dj&quot; and &quot;stj&quot; represent consonant clusters in Danish and Norwegian and the consonants and respectively in Swedish. The combination &quot;lj&quot; is pronounced in Norwegian and Swedish, not used in Danish (Norwegian &quot;ljore&quot; – Danish &quot;lyre&quot;, &quot;hole in the roof&quot;; Swedish &quot;ljus&quot; – Danish and Norwegian &quot;lys&quot; [Nynorsk also &quot;ljos&quot;], &quot;light&quot;). On the other hand, &quot;hj&quot; is pronounced in all the three languages.
*The consonant combinations &quot;nd&quot; and &quot;ld&quot; are pronounced the same as &quot;nn&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; in Danish and Norwegian. In Swedish, they are pronounced as written.

=== Prosody ===
In Norwegian and Swedish, each stressed syllable must contain, phonetically, either a long vowel or a long (geminate) consonant (e.g. &quot;male&quot; , &quot;to paint&quot; versus &quot;malle&quot; , &quot;catfish&quot;) . In Danish, there are no phonologically long consonants, so the opposition is between long and short vowels ( versus ).
All the three languages have a prosodic opposition between two &quot;accents&quot;, derived from syllable count in Old Norse and determined partly phonologically, partly morphologically and partly lexically. However, the exact nature of this prosodic contrast is very different. In Norwegian and Swedish, the contrast is between two tonal accents, accent 1 and 2, which characterise a whole word with primary stress; in Danish, it is between the presence and the absence of the stød (a kind of laryngealisation), which characterises a syllable (though usually a syllable that bears at least secondary stress). Example: Danish &quot;løber&quot; &quot;runner&quot; versus &quot;løber&quot; &quot;runs&quot; , Norwegian &quot;løper&quot;2 versus &quot;løper&quot;1 , Swedish &quot;löpare&quot;2 versus &quot;löper&quot;1 . Note Danish &quot;landsmand&quot; &quot;compatriot&quot; (one word, two støds) as opposed to Norwegian &quot;landsmann&quot; and Swedish &quot;landsman&quot; (one word, one accent).

&quot;Note: The pronunciation of the tone accents varies widely between Norwegian dialects; the IPA tone accent transcriptions above reflect South-East Norwegian pronunciation (found e.g. in Oslo). There is usually also high pitch in the last syllable, but it is not transcribed here, because it belongs to the prosody of the phrase rather than the word.&quot;

=== Vowels in inflections ===
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish in inflections (declension, conjugation) attach, albeit to a limited extent, endings. These endings are always unstressed and contain only short vowels. The use of vowels in these endings depends on the degree of reduction, which is highest in Danish. It allows only reduced &lt;e&gt; in endings, pronounced as [ə]. Bokmål most often has reduced &lt;e&gt; in endings, less often also &lt;a&gt;. Nynorsk uses &lt;a&gt; more often, other vowels less often. Swedish has the lowest reduction rate. It allows most vowels in endings, while the basic vowel in inflections is &lt;a&gt;.

Examples:
=== Rendering of Graeco-Latin &quot;ae&quot; (αι) and &quot;oe&quot; (οι) ===

While Danish renders Graeco-Latin &quot;ae&quot; (αι) as &quot;æ&quot; (with some exceptions: &quot;Etiopien, Ægypten/Egypten&quot;), Norwegian and Swedish mostly use &quot;e&quot;. For example, Danish &quot;ækvivalent&quot; — Norwegian and Swedish &quot;ekvivalent&quot; (equivalent). In Norwegian, &quot;æ&quot; is kept before &quot;r&quot;: &quot;æra, kimære, sfære&quot;; Swedish has &quot;chimär, sfär&quot; but &quot;era&quot;. &quot;Caesar&quot; is spelled &quot;Cæsar&quot; in Danish and Norwegian; Swedish uses unligatured spelling &quot;Caesar&quot;, pronounced as if spelled *&quot;Cesar&quot;.

Graeco-Latin &quot;oe&quot; (οι) is rendered as &quot;ø&quot; in Danish and Norwegian, but as &quot;e&quot; in Swedish: Danish and Norwegian &quot;økologi&quot; — Swedish &quot;ekologi&quot; (ecology).

== Grammatical differences ==

=== Nominal morphology ===

==== Gender ====
Danish and Swedish have two grammatical genders – common (indefinite article &quot;en&quot; and definite article &quot;-en&quot;) and neuter (indefinite article &quot;et&quot; [Danish]/&quot;ett&quot; [Swedish] and definite article &quot;-et&quot;). In Norwegian, the system is generally the same, but some common words optionally use special feminine gender declension patterns, which have been preserved from Old Norse in Norwegian dialects and were re-introduced into the written language by the language reforms of the early 20th century. Hence, three genders are recognized – masculine (morphologically identical to Danish common, with indefinite article &quot;en&quot; and definite article &quot;-en&quot;), feminine (indefinite article &quot;ei&quot; and definite article &quot;-a&quot;) and neuter (morphologically identical to its Danish counterpart, with indefinite article &quot;et&quot; and definite article &quot;-et&quot;, pronounced ). The likelihood of a feminine as opposed to common form being used depends on the particular word, as well as on style: common gender forms are often more formal or sometimes even bookish, while feminine forms tend to make a more colloquial and sometimes even rustic impression. Both variants are standard in Bokmål, whereas only the three-gender model is accepted in Nynorsk. Examples: Danish &quot;en mand&quot; – &quot;manden&quot; (&quot;a man – the man&quot;), &quot;en sol&quot; – &quot;solen&quot; (&quot;a sun – the sun&quot;), &quot;et hus&quot; – &quot;huset&quot; (&quot;a house – the house&quot;) versus Norwegian &quot;en mann&quot; – &quot;mannen&quot; (&quot;a man – the man&quot;), &quot;ei sol&quot; – &quot;sola&quot; or &quot;en sol&quot; – &quot;solen&quot; (&quot;a sun – the sun&quot;), &quot;et hus&quot; – &quot;huset&quot; (&quot;a house – the house&quot;).

The Norwegian feminine can also be expressed in the indefinite singular declension of the word &quot;liten&quot;, which has a special feminine form &quot;lita&quot; beside the neuter &quot;lite&quot;. Danish has only &quot;lille&quot;, which is the definite singular form in both languages.

==== Number ====
In Danish, the plural endings are &quot;-er&quot;, &quot;-e&quot; or zero-ending. The choice of ending is difficult to predict (although &quot;-er&quot; is especially common in polysyllables, loanwords and words ending in unstressed &quot;e&quot;; &quot;-e&quot; is most usual in monosyllables; and zero-ending is most usual in neuter monosyllables). In Norwegian, the plural suffix -e is used too, but the system is rather regularized, since it is only nouns ending with -er in uninflected form that get -e in indefinite plural form, and this is current for both masculine, feminine and neuter nouns; &quot;en skyskraper – skyskrapere&quot; &quot;a skyscraper – skyscrapers&quot;; &quot;en hamburger – hamburgere&quot; &quot;a hamburger – hamburgers&quot;; et monster – monstre &quot;a monster – monsters&quot;; &quot;et senter – sentre&quot; &quot;a center – centers&quot;. The ending &quot;-er&quot; (&quot;-ar&quot; in Nynorsk) is dominant in masculine/feminine nouns and some neuters with several syllables, while zero-ending is prevalent in neuter gender monosyllables. Examples: Danish &quot;en appelsin – appelsiner&quot;, &quot;en hund – hunde&quot;, &quot;et hus – huse&quot;, &quot;et fald – fald&quot;, versus Norwegian &quot;en appelsin – appelsiner&quot;, &quot;en hund – hunder&quot;, &quot;et hus – hus&quot;, &quot;et fall – fall&quot; (singular and plural forms of &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;house&quot; and &quot;fall&quot;). Swedish has five plural endings: &quot;-er, -or, -ar, -n&quot; and the zero ending (see the tables above and below).

In addition, the formation of the definite plural forms are somewhat different in the three languages. In Danish, plural forms in &quot;-er&quot; transform into definite plural &quot;-erne&quot;, while plurals in &quot;-e&quot; and zero-ending become &quot;-ene&quot;. Norwegian has generalized &quot;-ene&quot; (&quot;-ane&quot; in Nynorsk) for nearly all masculine and feminine words, and an &quot;-ene&quot; or &quot;-a&quot; for neuter words. A few masculine words also have an alternative ending &quot;-a&quot;, derived from &quot;-a(ne)&quot;/&quot;-æne&quot; in the spoken language (&quot;en feil – feila/feilene&quot;, &quot;a mistake/error – the mistakes/errors&quot;). Examples: Danish &quot;en sag – sager – sagerne&quot;, &quot;en dag – dage – dagene&quot;, &quot;et fald – fald – faldene&quot;, &quot;et ben – ben – benene&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;en sak – saker – sakene&quot;, &quot;en dag – dager – dagene&quot;, &quot;et fall – fall – fallene&quot;, &quot;et be(i)n – be(i)n – be(i)na/be(i)nene&quot; (singular, plural, and plural definite forms of &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;fall&quot; and &quot;bone&quot;/&quot;leg&quot;). Swedish adds &quot;-na&quot; to &quot;-er, -or, -ar&quot;; &quot;-a&quot; to &quot;-n&quot;; &quot;-en&quot; to zero ending.

==== Definiteness ====
In the three languages, single nouns use a postpositive definite article. However, in Danish, when a noun is modified by an adjective, a prepositive definite article is used instead of the postpositive one. Norwegian and Swedish both add a prepositive article and keep the postpositive. Example: Danish &quot;hus – huset&quot;, &quot;et stort hus – det store hus&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;hus – huset&quot;, &quot;et stort hus – det store huset&quot; and Swedish &quot;hus – huset&quot;, &quot;ett stort hus — det stora huset&quot; (indefinite and definite forms of &quot;a/the house&quot; and &quot;a/the big house&quot;). In proper designations, Swedish only keeps the postpositive article, and Bokmål does not add it: &quot;Det Hvide Hus&quot; (Danish) – &quot;Det hvite hus&quot; (Norwegian Bokmål) – &quot;Det kvite huset&quot; (Norwegian Nynorsk) – &quot;Vita huset&quot; (Swedish) (the White House).
The same difference applies when a demonstrative pronoun is used: Danish &quot;Jeg elsker den mand&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;Jeg elsker den mannen&quot; and Swedish &quot;Jag älskar den mannen&quot; (&quot;I love that man&quot;).

====Adjectives====
The declension of adjectives is basically the same in the three languages. Most of them form two forms in a single number: for the common gender (in Norwegian masculine and feminine) and for the neuter gender. In the plural, both genders have one form, which is at the same time a definite form, which is connected with nouns with a definite article.

In neuter forms, Swedish consistently appends the suffix -t (-tt) - except for the inflected adjectives of type bra (good). In Danish and even more often in Norwegian (especially Nynorsk) for some adjectives -t are not added:

&quot;svensk&quot; (Danish, Norwegian) - &quot;svenskt&quot; (Swedish) = Swedish

&quot;billigt&quot; (Danish, Swedish) - &quot;billig&quot; (Bokmål) - &quot;billeg&quot; (Nynorsk) = cheap

In Swedish, the spelling simplifies the group &quot;-dt&quot; (in neuter forms) to &quot;-tt&quot;: &quot;god&quot; / &quot;godt&quot; (Danish, Norwegian) - &quot;god&quot; / &quot;gott&quot; (Swedish) = good.

Definite and plural forms have the suffix &quot;-e&quot; in Danish and Norwegian, while &quot;-a&quot; in Swedish:

&quot;svenske søer&quot; (Danish) - &quot;svenske sjøer&quot; (Bokmål) - &quot;svenske sjøar&quot; (Nynorsk) - &quot;svenska sjöar&quot; (Swedish) = Swedish lakes

&quot;det gamle hus&quot; (Danish) - &quot;det gamle huset&quot; (nor.) - &quot;det gamla huset&quot; (Swedish) = (the) old house

In Swedish, definite forms of the original masculine gender with the ending &quot;-e&quot; are also possible in a singular number (only for male people): &quot;den gamle / gamla mannen&quot; = (the) old man.

==== Pronouns ====
*To denote second person plural, Danish uses &quot;I&quot; (oblique form &quot;jer&quot;, possessive pronoun &quot;jeres&quot;), while Norwegian uses &quot;dere&quot; (oblique &quot;dere&quot;, possessive &quot;deres&quot;). Swedish uses &quot;ni&quot; (oblique and possessive &quot;er&quot;); the variant &quot;I&quot; (oblique &quot;eder&quot;, possessive &quot;eder&quot; or &quot;eders&quot;) is obsolete.
*The 1st person plural possessive pronoun (&quot;our&quot;) is &quot;vores&quot; (uninflected) in modern Danish, but &quot;vår&quot; (inflected: neuter &quot;vårt&quot;, plural &quot;våre&quot; [Norwegian] or &quot;våra&quot; [Swedish]) in Norwegian and Swedish. Example: Danish &quot;vores ven/hus/venner&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;vår venn&quot;/&quot;vårt hus&quot;/&quot;våre venner&quot; or, like in the spoken language, &quot;vennen vår&quot;/&quot;huset vårt&quot;/&quot;vennene våre&quot; (&quot;our friend/house/friends&quot;). In Danish, the original inflected variant &quot;vor&quot; (&quot;vort&quot;, &quot;vore&quot;) occurs only in more solemn or archaic style.
*The possessive pronouns always precede what they are modifying in Danish and Swedish; in Norwegian, they may also be placed &quot;after&quot; a definite noun or noun phrase. The choice of construction in Norwegian depends on the particular word and on style (the Danish-like construction is more formal or emphatic, the other one is more colloquial). Example: Danish &quot;min ven&quot;, &quot;min nye ven&quot; — Swedish &quot;min vän&quot;, &quot;min nya vän&quot; — Norwegian &quot;vennen min&quot; or &quot;min venn&quot;, &quot;den nye vennen min&quot; or &quot;min nye venn&quot; (&quot;my friend&quot;, &quot;my new friend&quot;). Nynorsk does not allow the Danish construction, which in Bokmål was inherited from Danish.
*The reflexive possessive pronoun &quot;sin&quot; (&quot;his/her/its own&quot;) can&#x27;t refer to a plural subject in Danish, but it can do so in Norwegian and Swedish. Example: Danish &quot;Han vasker sine klæder&quot; like Norwegian &quot;Han vasker klærne sine&quot; and Swedish &quot;Han vasker sina kläder&quot; (&quot;He is washing his [own] clothes&quot;); but Danish &quot;De vasker deres klæder&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;De vasker klærne sine&quot; and Swedish &quot;De vasker sina kläder&quot; (&quot;They are washing their [own] clothes&quot;).
*In Danish, the pronoun that expresses an unspecified, generalized person or group (corresponding to English &quot;one&quot;, French &quot;on&quot; and German &quot;man&quot;) is &quot;man&quot; in its main form, but its oblique form is &quot;en&quot; and its genitive form is &quot;ens&quot;. In Norwegian and Swedish, &quot;en&quot; can also be used as a main form. Example: Danish &quot;man kan ikke gøre det&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;man/en kan ikke gjøre det&quot; and Swedish &quot;man/en kan inte göra det&quot; (&quot;one/people can&#x27;t do that&quot;).
*In Danish and Swedish, the pronouns &quot;such&quot; and &quot;so (=in this way)&quot; are usually translated with &quot;sådan&quot; (&quot;slig&quot; [Danish]/&quot;slik&quot; [Swedish] is obsolete and solemn). In Norwegian, the most usual form is &quot;slik&quot;, but &quot;sådan&quot; is also correct (&quot;sånn&quot; can be somewhat colloquial).
*In Danish, Bokmål and Swedish, the pronouns &quot;han&quot; and &quot;hun&quot; (Danish and Bokmål)/&quot;hon&quot; (Swedish) refer to male and female people, but &quot;den&quot; and &quot;det&quot; are used for other common- and neuter-gender nouns. Nynorsk uses &quot;han&quot; for masculine nouns, &quot;ho&quot; for feminine nouns, &quot;det&quot; for neuter nouns.
*In Danish and Norwegian, the pronoun &quot;de&quot; (they) is pronounced [diː], but in Swedish its usual pronunciation is [dɔmː]; the same pronunciation is used for its oblique case &quot;dem&quot;, which in Danish and Norwegian is pronounced according to the spelling.

==== Numerals ====
There are significant differences between the numeral systems of Danish and Norwegian.
*In Danish, the number 7 is called &quot;syv&quot;. In Norwegian, it is called &quot;sju&quot; (although the 2005 language reform re-introduced &quot;syv&quot; as an alternative to &quot;sju&quot;).
*In Danish, 20 and 30 are called &quot;tyve&quot; and &quot;tredive&quot;. These forms (with &quot;tredive&quot; shortened to &quot;tredve&quot;) were replaced in Norwegian in 1951 by the native &quot;tjue&quot; and &quot;tretti&quot;. Like &quot;syv&quot;, which was replaced by &quot;sju&quot; at the same time, they still occur in Norwegian. The unofficial Riksmål standard retains the old forms.
*In Danish, the number 40 is called &quot;fyrre&quot;. In Norwegian, it is &quot;førti&quot;, although &quot;førr&quot; is permitted in riksmål.
*In Danish, the tens between 50 and 90 have different roots from the ones in most Germanic languages. Etymologically, like French numerals for 70, 80 and 90, they are based on a vigesimal system; in other words, the name of the number is based on how many times 20 it is. Thus, 60 is &quot;tres&quot; (short for &quot;tresindstyve&quot;, &quot;3 times 20&quot;) and 50 is &quot;halvtreds&quot; (short for &quot;halvtredsindstyve&quot;, &quot;2.5 times 20&quot; or more literally &quot;half-third times 20&quot;). Similarly, 70 is &quot;halvfjerds&quot;, 80 is &quot;firs&quot;, and 90 is &quot;halvfems&quot;. In Norwegian, these numbers are constructed much like in English and German, as compound words of the respective unit and an old word for &quot;ten&quot;: 50 = &quot;femti&quot;, 60 = &quot;seksti&quot;, 70 = &quot;sytti&quot; , 80 = &quot;åtti&quot;, 90 = &quot;nitti&quot;.
*In Danish, units are placed before tens (as in German and Early Modern English); in Norwegian, the reverse applies (as in Modern English), although the Danish order is also used by some speakers. Example: Danish &quot;enogtyve&quot; (&quot;one-and-twenty&quot;) versus Norwegian &quot;tjueen&quot; (&quot;twenty-one&quot;) or &quot;enogtyve&quot;.
*With regard to ordinal numbers, &quot;second&quot; has pretty much the same form in the two languages: &quot;anden&quot; (neuter &quot;andet&quot;, plural &quot;andre&quot;) in Danish and &quot;annen&quot; (neuter &quot;annet&quot;, plural &quot;andre&quot;) in Norwegian. However, Danish does not have a definite form but says &quot;den anden&quot;, whereas Norwegian uses &quot;den andre&quot;.

Swedish numerals are similar to Norwegian ones: &quot;sju&quot; (7), &quot;tjugo&quot; (20), &quot;trettio&quot; (30), &quot;fyrtio&quot; (40), &quot;femtio&quot; (50), &quot;sextio&quot; (60), &quot;sjuttio&quot; (70), &quot;åttio&quot; (80), &quot;nittio&quot; (90), &quot;tjugoen&quot; (21), &quot;andra&quot; (the second).

=== Verbal morphology ===
*Danish regular verbs can be divided in those that form their past tense and past participle with the suffixes &quot;-ede&quot; and &quot;-et&quot; , respectively, (e.g. &quot;to throw&quot;, &quot;kaste – kastede – kastet&quot;) and those that form them with the suffixes &quot;-te&quot; and &quot;-t&quot; (e.g. &quot;to read&quot;, &quot;læse – læste – læst&quot;). Although the group in &quot;-ede&quot;, &quot;-et&quot; is the largest one, the choice between these two conjugation patterns is mostly unpredictable. The corresponding Norwegian groups use &quot;-et&quot;, &quot;-et&quot; (&quot;kaste – kastet – kastet&quot;), and &quot;-te&quot;, &quot;-t&quot; (&quot;lese – leste – lest&quot;). However, unlike Danish, the choice of conjugation has come to be governed by a rule (with a few exceptions): verb stems containing a short vowel, followed by a long consonant or a consonant cluster (as in &quot;ramme&quot;), use &quot;-et&quot;, and verb stems containing a long vowel, followed by a short consonant (as in &quot;male&quot;), use &quot;-te&quot; (Danish &quot;ramme – ramte – ramt&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;ramme – rammet – rammet&quot; &quot;to hit&quot;; Danish &quot;male – malede – malet&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;male – malte – malt&quot; &quot;to paint&quot;). In addition, verb stems ending in a stressed vowel form a third group with no parallel in Danish, using the endings &quot;-dde&quot;, &quot;-dd&quot; (&quot;to live [somewhere]&quot; – &quot;bo – bodde – bodd&quot;). The corresponding Danish verbs nearly always use &quot;-ede&quot;, &quot;-et&quot; (&quot;bo – boede – boet&quot;). Swedish uses the endings &quot;-ade, -ad&quot;, &quot;-de, -d&quot; and &quot;-dde, -dd&quot;, where &quot;d&quot; or &quot;dd&quot; is replaced by &quot;t&quot; or &quot;tt&quot; in the neuter.

:Bokmål has also introduced the optional use of the ending &quot;-a&quot; (taken from Norwegian dialects and used as the only allowed form in Nynorsk) instead of &quot;-et&quot;: thus, &quot;kaste – kasta – kasta&quot;, &quot;ramme – ramma – ramma&quot;, etc. The use of forms in &quot;-a&quot; is more common in speech than in writing. Nynorsk also allows infinitive ending in &quot;-a&quot;: &quot;kaste/kasta – kasta – kasta&quot;. Swedish also ends infinitives in &quot;-a&quot;.

*Some Danish irregular verbs have longer forms, ending in unstressed &quot;-de&quot;, &quot;-ge&quot; and &quot;-ve&quot;, which have been dropped in Norwegian. In many cases, the Danish verbs may also be pronounced in the contracted way. Examples: Danish &quot;lade – lod – ladet&quot;, &quot;sige – sagde – sagt&quot;, &quot;blive – blev – blevet&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;la – lot – latt&quot;, &quot;si – sa – sagt&quot;, &quot;bli – ble(i) – blitt&quot; (&quot;let&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, &quot;become&quot;). Other examples are &quot;tage – tog – taget&quot; versus &quot;ta – tok – tatt&quot; (&quot;to take&quot;), &quot;have – havde – haft&quot; versus &quot;ha – hadde – hatt&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;), etc.. The same reduction exists in some verbs in Swedish (e. g. &quot;bli – blev – bliven&quot; [besides the formal infinitive &quot;bliva&quot;]).
*The perfect forms in Danish may be formed either with the auxiliary verb &quot;have&quot; &quot;to have&quot; (as in English) or with &quot;være&quot; &quot;to be&quot;. Some verbs always use &quot;være&quot; (&quot;ske&quot; &quot;happen&quot;, &quot;holde op&quot; &quot;stop&quot;), while others can use both auxiliaries, but with slightly different meanings: &quot;han har rejst&quot; &quot;he has travelled (spent some time travelling)&quot; emphasizes the action itself, while &quot;han er rejst&quot; &quot;he has left (so he isn&#x27;t here now)&quot; emphasizes the result of the action. In Norwegian and Swedish, &quot;ha&quot; &quot;to have&quot; may be – and increasingly is – used in all cases, and no specific verbs require &quot;være/vara&quot;: &quot;han er død&quot; (Danish) - &quot;han har dødd&quot; (Bokmål) - &quot;han har døydd / døytt&quot; (Nynorsk) - &quot;han har dött&quot; (Swedish) = he has died.
*Danish and Norwegian use the past participle in perfect tenses, but Swedish uses a different form, the supine. For weak verbs, it is identical to the neuter gender of the participle, but for strong verbs, the neuter of the participle ends in &quot;-et&quot; but the supine ends in &quot;-it&quot;.
*The past participle in Swedish is consistently inflected as an adjective. The participle of most verbs has three clearly distinguished forms (two in the singular for the common and neuter gender; one for both genders in the plural, which is also a definite form). The participle must agree with the noun in the gender and the number, whether placed before the noun or after another verb:

&quot;Biljetterna blev köpta och betalade&quot;. = Tickets have been bought and paid for.

In Danish and Bokmål, declension of participles is simplified. From most verbs, only a definite and indefinite form is formed, without distinction of gender. For strong verbs, some Danish verbs have preserved a form in a common gender with the ending &quot;-en&quot; (as in Swedish). If the participle comes after a verb, grammatical agreement does not apply in both languages:

&quot;Billeterne blev købt og betalt&quot;. (Danish) - &quot;Billettene ble kjøpt og betalt&quot;. (Bokmål) = Tickets have been bought and paid for.

In Nynorsk, as in Swedish, most participles are inflected, but some are indeclined (for example, the forms na -a: &quot;elska&quot; - see the table below). Grammatical agreement in the sentence is mandatory only for strong verbs, for weak verbs it is applied optionally and for some verbs it is not applied at all.

The present participles in all Scandinavian languages are indeclinable.

*S-forms of verbs, i. e. forms ending in -s (in Nynorsk -st), have three uses in all Scandinavian languages:
**deponent verbs - verbs in passive form with active meaning;
**reciprocal verbs - verbs expressing reciprocity;
**passive voice, the so-called s-passive.
Deponent and reciprocal verbs are common to all languages. However, the use of s-forms is different. In Swedish, the passive voice is commonly expressed in this way (although the s-passive is more formal than the analytical passive). The suffix &quot;-s&quot; can be appended to any verb form (including supine) except for participles. In Danish and Norwegian, the s-passive is of limited use. In Danish and Bokmål, only the passive forms of the infinitive and the present tense are more commonly formed in this way. In Nynorsk, the ending &quot;-st&quot; can only be added to the infinitive that follows the modal verb, e.g.: &quot;Ingenting kunne gjørast&quot;. = There was nothing that could be done. Otherwise, the passive must be expressed analytically, or avoided altogether.

*Some examples of verbs in the three languages:



=== Miscellaneous ===
Certain words present in all the three languages are used differently in each. This can result in identical sentences meaning different things in the three languages, or in constructions that make sense in one language becoming nonsensical in another one.

Examples include:
*&quot;må/kan&quot; – The word &quot;må&quot; usually means &quot;must&quot; in Norwegian, but can mean &quot;may&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, or &quot;must&quot; in Danish. Swedish uses &quot;kan&quot; for &quot;can&quot;, &quot;måste&quot; for &quot;must&quot;, and &quot;får&quot; or &quot;må&quot; for &quot;may&quot;.
*&quot;der/som&quot; – Danish has both words for &quot;which&quot;, although &quot;der&quot; is only used as the grammatical subject. In Norwegian, &quot;der&quot; is only used archaically or poetically. Swedish uses &quot;som&quot;, and &quot;vilken, vilket, vilka&quot;.
*&quot;nogle/nogen&quot; – in written Danish the counterparts of the English words &quot;some&quot; (in a plural sense) and &quot;any&quot; are spelled &quot;nogle&quot; and &quot;nogen&quot;, respectively – although in speech, &quot;nogle&quot; is pronounced just like &quot;nogen&quot;. In contrast, in Norwegian both are spelled identically, as &quot;noen&quot; (from Danish &quot;nogen&quot;). Swedish uses &quot;någon, några, en del&quot;, or &quot;somliga&quot;.
*&quot;kun/bare&quot; – in Danish, &quot;kun&quot; means roughly &quot;only, solely&quot; (referring to quantity or number) and &quot;bare&quot; &quot;just, merely&quot;. &quot;Kun&quot; is used more often in Denmark, whereas &quot;bare&quot; is used more often in Norway. While there are rules in Danish that govern when to choose which word, in Norwegian &quot;bare&quot; may be – and usually is – used with both meanings. Swedish uses &quot;bara&quot;, &quot;endast&quot; or &quot;enkom&quot;.
*&quot;meget/mye&quot; – in Norwegian, the adverb &quot;meget&quot; (alternatively &quot;veldig&quot; etc.) modifies adjectives just like English &quot;very&quot;, while &quot;mye&quot; is used like English &quot;much, a lot&quot;. In Danish, &quot;meget&quot; is used in both cases. Swedish typically uses &quot;mycket&quot; or &quot;väldigt&quot; for &quot;very&quot;, and &quot;mycket&quot; for &quot;much&quot;. 
*&quot;enda/ennå (ennu)&quot; – in Norwegian, &quot;ennå&quot; means &quot;still, yet&quot; in a temporal sense, but &quot;enda&quot;, which normally means &quot;yet, nevertheless&quot; among other things, is used in conjunction with comparative forms in expressions such as &quot;enda bedre&quot;, &quot;better still&quot;. In Danish, &quot;endnu&quot; (the equivalent of &quot;ennå&quot;) is used in both cases. Swedish uses &quot;än&quot;, &quot;ännu&quot; for &quot;yet&quot;, &quot;still&quot; while &quot;ände&quot; or &quot;ända&quot; means &quot;the end&quot; (much like &quot;slut&quot; does).
*The primary difference in preposition usage in the Danish and Norwegian languages is the use of &quot;i &quot;/ &quot;på&quot;, (in English in / on). Although the two are generally used similarly in both languages, in certain cases the two languages choose a different preposition for the same construction. For example, &quot;a quarter to five&quot; would be &quot;kvart i fem&quot; in Danish, but &quot;kvart på fem&quot; in Norwegian. To express a period of time during which something has happened, Danish always uses &quot;i&quot;, but Norwegian uses &quot;i&quot; in affirmative and &quot;på&quot; in negative sentences: Danish &quot;jeg har (ikke) set ham i to år&quot; versus Norwegian &quot;jeg har sett ham i to år&quot;, &quot;jeg har ikke sett ham på to år&quot; (&quot;I have [not] seen him for two years&quot;). Swedish uses forms like &quot;kvart&quot; i &quot;fem&quot;, and &quot;... sett honom&quot; i &quot;två års tid&quot;, but ... inte &quot;sett honom&quot; på &quot;två år&quot;.
*&quot;genitive constructions&quot; – unlike Danish, Norwegian very often uses the preposition &quot;til&quot; (&quot;to&quot;) as a more informal alternative of genitive constructions: &quot;boka til Peter&quot;, or &quot;Peters bok&quot; versus Danish &quot;Peters bog&quot;. Norwegian also uses a construction with the reflexive pronoun, &quot;Peter sin bok&quot;, (Lit. &quot;Peter his book&quot;). This is in Norwegian bokmål called &quot;garpegenitiv&quot; and is (in bokmål) still considered substandard by some. Swedish is like Danish in this regard, except in some rural dialects.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Geographical names ===

==== Names of countries ====
Danish has adopted many German (particularly from Low German variants spoken by the Hanseatic League) words and grammatical structures, while Bokmål has rejected some of these imports. An example is the naming of countries; Danish and Swedish generally use the German names of countries, or at least the German ending.

These names were used in Norwegian as well, but have in modern times (during the second half of the 20th century) to a large extent been replaced by the Latin endings; this means that the usual ending is &quot;-a&quot; in Norwegian and &quot;-en&quot; or &quot;-et&quot; in Danish (the &quot;-en&quot; and &quot;-et&quot; endings are also the definite articles). In the case of Switzerland, which is known in written Danish and Swedish by its German name &quot;Schweiz&quot;, this is transliterated in Norwegian as &quot;Sveits&quot;.

As a result, &quot;Australien&quot;, &quot;Italien&quot; and &quot;Spanien&quot; are used in Danish and Swedish, but as &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Italia&quot; and &quot;Spania&quot; in Bokmål, although the earlier forms can be heard in speakers of more conservative forms (for instance Queen Sonja of Norway). Similarly, while &quot;Mongolia&quot; and &quot;Slovakia&quot; are now used in Norwegian, &quot;Mongoliet&quot; and &quot;Slovakiet&quot;/&quot;Slovakien&quot; are still used in Danish and Swedish.

In Danish, Latvia is referred to as &quot;Letland&quot;, similar to German &quot;Lettland&quot; (which is used in Swedish), whereas in Norwegian, it is referred to as &quot;Latvia&quot; (although &quot;Letland&quot; and &quot;Lettland&quot; were previously used), but Estonia and Lithuania are referred to in the three languages as &quot;Estland&quot; and &quot;Litauen&quot;, as in German.

Other differences include the use in Norwegian of the native names of countries. In Danish, Greece is referred to as &quot;Grækenland&quot; and in Swedish as &quot;Grekland&quot;, but in Norwegian, it is mostly referred to as &quot;Hellas&quot; (the Greek form of the name), even though the Danish-like &quot;Grekenland&quot; is sometimes used. Similarly, the name for Cyprus in Norwegian is the Greek-derived &quot;Kypros&quot;, rather than the &quot;Cypern&quot; (influenced by the German &quot;Zypern&quot;) used in Danish and Swedish.

Nevertheless, Norwegians usually use &quot;greker&quot; (noun) and &quot;gresk&quot; (adjective) for &quot;Greek&quot;, not &quot;hellener&quot; (noun) and &quot;hellensk&quot; (adjective); the latter are used only when talking about Ancient Greece, in the sense of &quot;Hellenic&quot;, as in English and other languages.

In addition, Norwegian speakers, unlike Danish speakers, refer to the Netherlands as &quot;Nederland&quot;, as in Dutch, not as &quot;Holland&quot;, although &quot;Nederlandene&quot; is used in Danish in the same formal sense as &quot;The Netherlands&quot; would be in English. In Swedish, the form &quot;Nederländerna&quot; is used. Similarly the Dutch language is known as &quot;nederlandsk&quot; in Norway and &quot;nederländska&quot; in Sweden, but is most often called &quot;hollandsk&quot; in Denmark (the Norwegian dictionary &quot;Bokmålsordboka&quot; identify both &quot;Holland&quot; and &quot;hollandsk&quot; as previously commonly used in Norwegian).

By contrast, both Norwegian and Danish speakers refer to New Zealand by its English name (but &quot;Ny-Zealand&quot; is also used in Norwegian), whereas Swedish speakers call the country &quot;Nya Zeeland&quot;. However, &quot;New Zealand&quot; as an adjective is &quot;newzealandsk&quot; or &quot;nyzealandsk&quot; in Norwegian, whereas &quot;newzealandsk&quot; is encountered in Danish, In Danish, &quot;New Zealander&quot; is &quot;newzealænder&quot; while in Norwegian it can be translated as either &quot;newzealender&quot; or &quot;nyzealender&quot;.

==== Names of cities ====

There are also differences in the names of cities; each language choosing to use the more native name, or one borrowed from another language. For example:

* Helsinki in Norwegian, is referred to as &quot;Helsingfors&quot;, as in Swedish, whereas in Danish it is usually called &quot;Helsinki&quot;, as in Finnish.
* Brussels in Danish, is referred to as &quot;Bruxelles&quot;, as in French, or sometimes &quot;Bryssel&quot; as in Swedish, while in Norwegian it is known as &quot;Brussel&quot;, as in Dutch (but &quot;Bruxelles&quot; was permitted until 1961).
* Lisbon in Norwegian, however, is known as &quot;Lisboa&quot;, as in Portuguese, whereas in Danish and Swedish it is known as &quot;Lissabon&quot;, as in German. (However, &quot;Lissabon&quot; was previously used in Norwegian).
* Prague is known in Danish and Swedish as &quot;Prag&quot;, as in German, unlike Norwegian, in which the Czech name &quot;Praha&quot; is used.
* Bucharest likewise, is known in Danish and Swedish as &quot;Bukarest&quot;, but in Norwegian the Romanian name &quot;București&quot; is used.
* Belgrade is known in Danish and Norwegian under the Serbian name &quot;Beograd&quot;, but in Swedish the form &quot;Belgrad&quot; is used.
* Beijing likewise, is known in Danish and Norwegian in the pinyin spelling, but Swedish usually uses the form &quot;Peking&quot;.
* Moscow and Warsaw however, are known in all the three languages by their respective Russian and Polish names, &quot;Moskva&quot; and &quot;Warszawa&quot;.

=== Different words ===

Here are some examples of common words and expressions that are different in the three languages. Note that the Danish variant usually exists in Norwegian as an archaic or less frequent form (and/or vice versa).

=== False friends ===
While most words have the same meaning, there are also a number of false friends. These are often cognates that have diverged in meaning.
The vulgar nature of some of these differences forms the basis of a number of television sketches by Norwegian comedians.

<text>American Girl is a 2002 American comedy-drama film directed by Jordan Brady and starring Jena Malone, who also serves as a co-producer. Co-starring are Brad Renfro, Chris Mulkey, Michelle Forbes, Alicia Witt, and Clifton Collins, Jr. The film follows a pregnant, naive teenager who convinces her family to visit their father in prison at its annual family picnic, only for him to not be what she had idealized.

The film premiered on October 14, 2002 at the Austin Film Festival. It was later released to DVD on January 11, 2005 under the title Confessions of an American Girl.

==Plot==
Rena is a suicidal and naive teenage girl whose father John is serving a long prison sentence. She has an idealistic view of her father. Her boyfriend, the popular Kenton, only uses her for sex, and other teenage girls tease her relentlessly. She eventually becomes pregnant with Kenton&#x27;s baby, which she is excited to keep.

Rena and her family - mother Madge, half-sister Barbie, and brother Jay - travel to John&#x27;s prison for the annual family picnic at Rena&#x27;s insistence despite her family&#x27;s discomfort. Things seem to be going just fine, but he eventually becomes abusive and angry. Rena tells her dad that she&#x27;s pregnant, news which John does not handle well. Jay, who is secretly gay, wanders off to tour the prison with another inmate named Buddy. Barbie sneaks off to the conjugal visit trailers to have sex with John; Barbie has been secretly visiting the prison regularly and has been having an affair with her stepfather. After she is caught by Buddy and Jay, the other inmates watch as Buddy makes Barbie squeal like a pig in exchange for not reporting her to her mother. Rena bonds with Faye, an institutionalized woman who is also overcoming her anxiety and suicidal tendencies. Jay and Buddy bond, and when the tour is over Buddy gives Jay a haircut.

Madge later discovers from the family&#x27;s overseeing officer, Deputy Richard, that her husband is having an affair. As Madge attacks John, Jay and Buddy secretly kiss passionately before Buddy returns to his cell. When the guards apprehend John, he stumbles backwards and falls on Rena. Rena rushes to the bathroom, finding that she&#x27;s bled, and lost the baby. She breaks a picture frame and uses the glass shards to slit her wrists, but Jay saves her just in time.

Madge and the children realize that John will not change his abusive ways and that continuing to support him has been holding the family back. Madge announces that she is moving the family to Florida in Disneyworld, and Rena finally stands up to her father. John is relieved that she is no longer pregnant, leading Rena to pounce on him in anger. After being snapped into reality by her siblings, Rena realizes that her &quot;fond&quot; memories of her relationship with her father were self-delusions.

Rena tells Kenton about the miscarriage of their baby and when he expresses indifference, she breaks up with him and causes his prized car to drive into a swimming pool. Rena cuts ties with her father, Barbie finds a job as a manicurist, while Jay is accepted to culinary school in California. As Rena, Madge, and Jay leave home for Florida, Rena remarks that the only thing she remembers about the picnic is leaving.

==Critical reception==
&quot;American Girl&quot; received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Jeff Paramchuk from DVD Talk website gave it three out of five stars and wrote that &quot;there really is nothing wrong with this movie, but I can see how that it would not appeal to a very large group especially given its plot&quot;, he also says that &quot;Confessions is a decent alternative from a lot of the teen movies that we see out in recent times, but not quite on par with films that get general release&quot;. David Nusair from &quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; gave it one and a half out of four stars and wrote that the screenplay &quot;emphasizing tired jokes over character development&quot; and as a result &quot;the film feels more like an extended sitcom pilot than anything else&quot; and conclude that &quot;unless your idea of a good time is watching an episode of Cops, it&#x27;s highly unlikely you&#x27;ll find much here to embrace.&quot;

<doc id="1317242" wikidata="Q1074839" url="?curid=1317242" title="Atrium (heart)">
<text>The atrium (; : atria) is one of the two upper chambers in the heart that receives blood from the circulatory system. The blood in the atria is pumped into the heart ventricles through the atrioventricular mitral and tricuspid heart valves.

There are two atria in the human heart – the left atrium receives blood from the pulmonary circulation, and the right atrium receives blood from the venae cavae of the systemic circulation. During the cardiac cycle, the atria receive blood while relaxed in diastole, then contract in systole to move blood to the ventricles. Each atrium is roughly cube-shaped except for an ear-shaped projection called an atrial appendage, previously known as an auricle. All animals with a closed circulatory system have at least one atrium.

The atrium was formerly called the &#x27;auricle&#x27;. That term is still used to describe this chamber in some other animals, such as the &quot;Mollusca&quot;. Auricles in this modern terminology are distinguished by having thicker muscular walls.

==Structure==

Humans have a four-chambered heart consisting of the right and left atrium, and the right and left ventricle. The atria are the two upper chambers which pump blood to the two lower ventricles.

The right atrium and ventricle are often referred to together as the right heart, and the left atrium and ventricle as the left heart. As the atria do not have valves at their inlets, a venous pulsation is normal, and can be detected in the jugular vein as the jugular venous pressure.
Internally, there are the rough pectinate muscles, and the crista terminalis of His, which act as a boundary inside the atrium and the smooth-walled part of the right atrium, the &quot;sinus venarum&quot;, which are derived from the sinus venosus. The sinus venarum is the adult remnant of the sinus venosus and it surrounds the openings of the venae cavae and the coronary sinus.
 Attached to each atrium is an atrial appendage.

===Right atrium===
The right atrium receives and holds deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, anterior cardiac veins, smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus, which it then sends down to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, which in turn sends it to the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation.

====Right atrial appendage====
The right atrial appendage (lat: auricula atrii dextra) is located at the front upper surface of the right atrium. Looking from the front, the right atrial appendage appears wedge-shaped or triangular. Its base surrounds the superior vena cava. The right atrial appendage is a pouch-like extension of the right atrium and is covered by a trabecula network of pectinate muscles. The interatrial septum separates the right atrium from the left atrium; this is marked by a depression in the right atrium – the fossa ovalis. The atria are depolarised by calcium.

===Left atrium===
The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the left and right pulmonary veins, which it pumps to the left ventricle (through the mitral valve (left atrioventricular valve) for pumping out through the aorta for systemic circulation.

====Left atrial appendage====

High in the upper part of the left atrium is a muscular ear-shaped pouch – the left atrial appendage (LAA) (lat: auricula atrii sinistra), which has a tubular trabeculated structure. LAA anatomy as seen in a CT scan is characterized as being in one of four groups: chicken wing (48%),
cactus (30%), windsock (19%), and cauliflower(3%). Cauliflower is the morphology most often associated with embolism. The LAA appears to &quot;function as a decompression chamber during left ventricular systole and during other periods when left atrial pressure is high&quot;. It also modulates intravascular volume by secreting natriuretic peptides, namely atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) into the coronary sinus, where they enter into the blood circulation.

The left atrial appendage can be seen on a standard posteroanterior X-ray, where the lower level of the left hilum becomes concave. It can also be seen clearly using transesophageal echocardiography. The left atrial appendage can serve as an approach for mitral valve surgery.
The body of the left atrial appendage is anterior to the left atrium and parallel to the left pulmonary veins. The left pulmonary artery passes posterosuperiorly and is separated from the atrial appendage by the transverse sinus. In atrial fibrillation, the left atrial appendage fibrillates rather than contracts resulting in blood stasis that predisposes to the formation of blood clots. Because of consequent stroke risk, surgeons may choose to close it during open-heart surgery, using a left atrial appendage occlusion procedure.

===Conduction system===

The sinoatrial node (SA node) is located in the posterior aspect of the right atrium, next to the superior vena cava. This is a group of pacemaker cells which spontaneously depolarize to create an action potential. The cardiac action potential then spreads across both atria causing them to contract, forcing the blood they hold into their corresponding ventricles.

The atrioventricular node (AV node) is another node in the cardiac conduction system. This is located between the atria and the ventricles.

===Blood supply===
The left atrium is supplied mainly by the left circumflex coronary artery, and its small branches.

The oblique vein of the left atrium is partly responsible for venous drainage; it derives from the embryonic left superior vena cava.

===Development===
During embryogenesis at about two weeks, a primitive atrium begins to be formed as one chamber, which over the following two weeks becomes divided by the septum primum into the left atrium and the right atrium. The interatrial septum has an opening in the right atrium, the foramen ovale, which provides access to the left atrium; this connects the two chambers, which is essential for fetal blood circulation. At birth, when the first breath is taken fetal blood flow is reversed to travel through the lungs. The foramen ovale is no longer needed and it closes to leave a depression (the fossa ovalis) in the atrial wall.

In some cases, the foramen ovale fails to close. This abnormality is present in approximately 25% of the general population. This is known as a &quot;patent foramen ovale&quot;, an atrial septal defect. It is mostly unproblematic, although it can be associated with paradoxical embolization and stroke.

Within the fetal right atrium, blood from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava flow in separate streams to different locations in the heart; this has been reported to occur through the Coandă effect.

==Function==
In human physiology, the atria facilitate circulation primarily by allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart during ventricular systole. By being partially empty and distensible, atria prevent the interruption of venous flow to the heart that would occur during ventricular systole if the veins ended at the inlet valves of the heart. In normal physiologic states, the output of the heart is pulsatile, and the venous inflow to the heart is continuous and non-pulsatile. But without functioning atria, venous flow becomes pulsatile, and the overall circulation rate decreases significantly.

Atria have four essential characteristics that cause them to promote continuous venous flow. (1) There are no atrial inlet valves to interrupt blood flow during atrial systole. (2) The atrial systole contractions are incomplete and thus do not contract to the extent that would block flow from the veins through the atria into the ventricles. During atrial systole, blood not only empties from the atria to the ventricles, but blood continues to flow uninterrupted from the veins right through the atria into the ventricles. (3) The atrial contractions must be gentle enough so that the force of contraction does not exert significant back pressure that would impede venous flow. (4) The &quot;let go&quot; of the atria must be timed so that they relax before the start of ventricular contraction, to be able to accept venous flow without interruption.

By preventing the inertia of interrupted venous flow that would otherwise occur at each ventricular systole, atria allow approximately 75% more cardiac output than would otherwise occur. The fact that atrial contraction is 15% of the amount of the succeeding ventricular ejection has led to a misplaced emphasis on their role in pumping up the ventricles (the so-called &quot;atrial kick&quot;), whereas the key benefit of atria is in preventing circulatory inertia and allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart.

Also of importance in maintaining the blood flow are the presence of atrial volume receptors. These are low-pressure baroreceptors in the atria, which send signals to the hypothalamus when a drop in atrial pressure (which indicates a drop in blood volume) is detected. This triggers a release of vasopressin.

==Disorders==
===Atrial septal defect===
In an adult, an atrial septal defect results in the flow of blood in the reverse direction – from the left atrium to the right – which reduces cardiac output, potentially causing cardiac failure, and in severe or untreated cases cardiac arrest and sudden death.

===Left atrial appendage thrombosis===

In patients with atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, and other conditions, blood clots have a tendency to form in the left atrial appendage. The clots may dislodge (forming emboli), which may lead to ischemic damage to the brain, kidneys, or other organs supplied by the systemic circulation.

In those with uncontrollable atrial fibrillation, left atrial appendage occlusion may be performed at the time of any open-heart surgery to prevent future clot formation within the appendage.

===Functional abnormalities===
* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
* Atrial flutter
* Atrial tachycardia
* Sinus tachycardia
* Multifocal atrial tachycardia – several types
* Premature atrial contraction

==Other animals==

Many other animals, including mammals, also have four-chambered hearts, which have a similar function. Some animals (amphibians and reptiles) have a three-chambered heart, in which the blood from each atrium is mixed in the single ventricle before being pumped to the aorta. In these animals, the left atrium still serves the purpose of collecting blood from the pulmonary veins.

In most fish, the circulatory system is very simple: a two-chambered heart including one atrium and one ventricle. Among sharks, the heart consists of four parts arranged serially: blood flows into the most posterior part, the sinus venosus, and then to the atrium which moves it to the third part, the ventricle, before it reaches the conus anteriosus, which itself is connected to the ventral aorta. This is considered a primitive arrangement, and many vertebrates have condensed the atrium with the sinus venosus and the ventricle with the conus anteriosus.
With the advent of lungs came a partitioning of the atrium into two parts divided by a septum. Among frogs, the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is mixed in the ventricle before being pumped out to the body&#x27;s organs; in turtles, the ventricle is almost entirely divided by a septum, but retains an opening through which some mixing of blood occurs. In birds, mammals, and some other reptiles (alligators in particular) the partitioning of both chambers is complete.

<text>In architecture, an atrium (: atria or atriums) is a large open-air or skylight-covered space surrounded by a building.
Atria were a common feature in Ancient Roman dwellings, providing light and ventilation to the interior. Modern atria, as developed in the late 19th and 20th centuries, are often several stories high, with a glazed roof or large windows, and often located immediately beyond a building&#x27;s main entrance doors (in the lobby).

Atria are a popular design feature because they give their buildings a &quot;feeling of space and light.&quot; The atrium has become a key feature of many buildings in recent years. Atria are popular with building users, building designers and building developers. Users like atria because they create a dynamic and stimulating interior that provides shelter from the external environment while maintaining a visual link with that environment. Designers enjoy the opportunity to create new types of spaces in buildings, and developers see atria as prestigious amenities that can increase commercial value and appeal.

==Ancient atria==

In a &quot;domus&quot;, a large house in ancient Roman architecture, the atrium was the open central court with enclosed rooms on all sides. In the middle of the atrium was the &quot;impluvium&quot;, a shallow pool sunken into the floor to catch rainwater from the roof. Some surviving examples are beautifully decorated. The opening in the ceiling above the pool (&quot;compluvium&quot;) called for some means of support for the roof, and it is here where one differentiates between five different styles of atrium. As the centrepiece of the house, the atrium was the most lavishly furnished room. Wealthier houses often included a marble &quot;cartibulum&quot;, an oblong marble table supported by &quot;trapezophoros&quot; pedestals depicting mythological creatures like winged griffins. Also, it contained the little chapel to the ancestral spirits (&quot;lararium&quot;), the household safe (&quot;arca&quot;) and sometimes a bust of the master of the house. The cylindrical puteal (a wellhead) gave access to the water cistern fed by water seeping through the porous bottom of the overlying impluvium. The atrium contributed to the passive cooling of the house.

The term was also used for a variety of spaces in public and religious buildings, mostly forms of arcaded courtyards, larger versions of the domestic spaces. Byzantine churches were often entered through such a space (as are many mosques, though the term atrium is not usually used to describe Islamic architecture).

==19th century: Glazed atrium==
The 19th century brought the industrial revolution with great advances in iron and glass manufacturing techniques. Courtyards could then have horizontal glazing overhead, eliminating some of the weather elements from the space and giving birth to the modern atrium.

==Modern-day atria==

Fire control is an important aspect of contemporary atrium design due to criticism that poorly designed atria could allow fire to spread to a building&#x27;s upper stories more quickly. Another downside to incorporating an atrium is that it typically creates unused vertical space which could otherwise be occupied by additional floors.

One of the main public spaces at Federation Square, in Melbourne, Australia, is called The Atrium and is a street-like space, five stories high with glazed walls and roof. The structure and glazing pattern follow the system of fractals used to arrange the panels on the rest of the facades at Federation Square.

In Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., the Opryland Hotel hosts 4 different large atria, spanning of glass ceiling in total, in the hotel above the gardens of: Delta, Cascades, Garden-Conservatories, and Magnolia.

When it opened in 2019, the Leeza SOHO in Beijing, had the world&#x27;s tallest atrium at , replacing the previous record-holder, the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. The Luxor Hotel, in Las Vegas, Nevada, has the largest atrium in the world (by volume) at .

<text>DeLand station is a train station in DeLand, Florida, United States, located west of the downtown area. It is served by SunRail commuter rail service and Amtrak and intercity service.

==History==

DeLand station was originally built in 1918, and stood across from the former Volusia County Fairgrounds. When the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad (and later the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) ran passenger service along the line, they also ran local passenger service to downtown DeLand over the DeLand Spur. The station was acquired by Amtrak and restored in 1988, although a second track at the station fell into disuse. Up until 2005, when it was truncated to New Orleans, the station also served as a stop for the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;.

In 2006, the station was rededicated following a $424,000 restoration undertaken through a partnership between Volusia County, Amtrak, and CSX Transportation; funding primarily came from the Florida Department of Transportation. Work included installation of a new roof and platform canopy, remodeling of the bathrooms, and painting of the building in historically appropriate colors. In 2007, the station received a Preservation Award from the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.

DeLand station was planned as the northern terminus of the SunRail commuter rail system. This led to the resumption of maintenance of the neglected second track and other station upgrades. The station saw the addition of an 184-space park, ride lot, and bus drop-off area. The station could &quot;spur economic development on the west end of the city, heading toward the St. Johns River.&quot; Ground broke on the extension in May 2023. The new service to DeLand began on August 12, 2024.

On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

<text>The Erie Times-News is a daily morning newspaper in Erie, Pennsylvania. It is owned by Gannett.

==The beginning==
The newspaper was founded as the &quot;Erie Daily Times&quot; on April 12, 1888, by nine printers involved in a labor dispute at another newspaper. They each invested $25 to establish the Times Publishing Company, which was initially located in a cellar at the corner of 9th Street and State Street. John J. Mead Sr., one of the founders, eventually bought out his partners. The Mead family headed the newspaper until August 2003.

The newspaper relocated to West 10th Street and Peach Street on April 12, 1924.

==One company, two newspapers==

The Times Publishing Company bought out the rival &quot;Erie Dispatch Herald&quot; in 1956 and co-located the two staffs in 1957 in the &quot;Dispatch Herald&quot;&#x27;s building at East 12th and French streets. On January 7, 1957, the &quot;Erie Morning News&quot; made its debut. The Times Publishing Company built a new plant, housing a Goss Metro offset press, at 205 West 12th Street, moving there on June 6, 1970. As it had done since 1957, the company kept the editorial departments of the &quot;Morning News&quot; (The &quot;Erie&quot; was removed from the name during the 1960s) and the &quot;Erie Daily Times&quot; separate. The other departments served the entire operation. News and sports reporters shared desks, coming in on separate shifts. Members of both staffs occupied the &quot;Times-News.&quot; In 1977, the two Saturday editions were combined into the &quot;Times-News Weekender,&quot; a paper staffed only by &quot;Morning News&quot; reporters and editors. The company published the &quot;Morning News&quot; and the afternoon &quot;Erie Daily Times&quot; until September 29, 2000, and September 1, 2000, respectively. The company merged the two staffs and operations into the present-day &quot;Erie Times-News&quot;, which was first published on October 2, 2000.

During most of the 1970s through the late 1990s cousins Ed, Mike and Frank Mead operated the company growing it from two daily newspapers, the Warren Times-Observer and the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot;. The company was variously involved in radio (Florida), cable television (Millcreek Township and Edinboro) and local weekly/weekly newspapers in Northwestern Pennsylvania and California.

The fourth generation of family owners entered the business in various capacities including editorial (Marnie Mead and Matt Mead) and Sales and Marketing (Sara Mead, Karen Mead and Chris Mead). In 1997, Chris Mead created the newspaper&#x27;s website, GoErie.com and a wholly owned subsidiary, CyberInk.

==&quot;Erie Times-News&quot; today==
Since the merger, the Meads have gradually shifted day-to-day leadership of the newspaper outside the family. In August 2003, company Vice President James E. Dible was promoted to chief executive officer, president and publisher, succeeding the retiring Michael Mead, a grandson of the company founder. At about the same time, Michael Mead&#x27;s first cousin, Edward M. Mead, stepped down as editor, turning over leadership of the newsroom to Executive Editor Rick Sayers. Michael Mead continues to serve on the company&#x27;s board of directors.

The &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; was named the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Newspaper of the Year&quot;. PNA awarded second place to the newspaper in 2006. The &quot;Newspaper of the Year status was repeated in 2009.

On January 16, 2006, the paper announced it was eliminating 24 positions immediately and would eliminate another 11 by February 3, leaving the Erie Times-News with about 250 employees. The paper also killed two of its three &quot;Neighbors&quot; zoned editions, a move that accounted for almost half of the initial 24 job cuts. Dible cited flat revenues and rising costs as the reason for the layoffs.

In September 2006, John Mead Flanagin was named chairman of the board. Flanagin is the first fourth-generation member of the Mead family to hold the position.

On September 13, 2007, the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; named Rosanne M. Cheeseman to succeed the retiring James Dible as CEO and publisher of the newspaper as of October 1, 2007.

On October 6, 2009, the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; announced that it had been awarded the &quot;Newspaper of the Year&quot; once again. The articles written about the Recession that were published in March and April were awarded honors as well.

On March 10, 2011, it was announced that 48 full-time and part-time employees of the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; would be permanently laid off from their positions in the printing and packaging departments of the newspaper.
On April 12, 2013, the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; celebrated its 125th anniversary.

On December 12, 2015, it was announced to &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; employees that the family-owned company will be sold to GateHouse Media (under New Media Investment Group) on January 12, 2016. The public was notified of the change in ownership on December 15, 2015.

On February 8, 2024, the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; announced it was switching from carrier to postal delivery.

<text>Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all (stylized as Three Dollar Bill, Yall$) is the debut studio album by American nu metal band Limp Bizkit, released on July 1, 1997, through Flip and Interscope Records. It established the band&#x27;s trademark sound with the singles &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, which was influenced by hip hop and heavy metal, and &quot;Faith&quot;, a cover of the 1987 song of the same name by George Michael. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s rearrangement of the song incorporated scratching by DJ Lethal and heavier guitar playing by Wes Borland.

&quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; was produced by Ross Robinson, who was introduced to the band through Korn bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu, who persuaded Robinson to listen to Limp Bizkit&#x27;s demo. Robinson was impressed by the band&#x27;s motivation and sound, and agreed to work with them. The album showcased an intentionally abrasive, angry sound which the band felt would attract a fanbase.

==Background==
Wes Borland left Limp Bizkit preceding a successful performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood due to a disagreement with Fred Durst. Soon after, Limp Bizkit signed with Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. While heading to California to record their first album, the band’s van was involved in a major crash whilst they were driving through Texas. The near death experience caused Durst to decide to make amends with Borland. After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip, a subsidiary of Interscope Records.

Reginald Arvizu of the band Korn persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the band&#x27;s demo, which consisted of the songs &quot;Pollution&quot;, &quot;Counterfeit&quot; and &quot;Stalemate&quot;. Robinson finally listened to the tape after it was praised by Robinson&#x27;s girlfriend. Robinson was impressed by the band&#x27;s motivation and sound, and produced their debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. During the recording of &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot;, the band recorded an early version of their song &quot;I&#x27;m Broke&quot;, but it was decided that the song didn&#x27;t fit on the album. It was subsequently reworked and recorded for their second studio album, &quot;Significant Other&quot;, released in 1999.

Continuing the band&#x27;s policy of using titles that would hopefully repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase &quot;queer as a three dollar bill&quot; and adding the word &quot;Y&#x27;alls&quot; (in possessive form) at the end to embody Florida slang into the title, consequently giving the album the name &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all$&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Pollution&quot;, according to Durst, is about people who say the band&#x27;s music is &quot;nothing but noise pollution. There&#x27;s nothing particularly heavy there. No big-time message.&quot; In a Q&amp;A, Durst said about the song: &quot;It&#x27;s like, well, you&#x27;re preaching and telling me that I&#x27;m so wrong—well, that&#x27;s noise to me because little do you know that my band says a prayer every time before they go on stage and we&#x27;re not just praying to Buddha or something.&quot; 

Limp Bizkit was inspired to write &quot;Counterfeit&quot; after local bands began to copy their style. According to Borland, &quot;They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, &#x27;Oh, let&#x27;s get baggy pants and dress like kind of hip-hoppy and, you know, play heavy metal and rap.&#x27; [...] five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were trying to sound like us. It was ridiculous. That&#x27;s where the song &#x27;Counterfeit&#x27; came from.&quot; Durst said &quot;Counterfeit&quot; is about people who try to fit in and change who they are. 

Fred Durst&#x27;s problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song &quot;Sour&quot;. 

The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, &quot;Everything&quot;. &quot;Everything&quot; is the longest song on the album at over sixteen minutes in length. The recording of the album also allowed the band to showcase the addition of DJ Lethal, and experimental guitar playing by Borland, who played without a guitar pick, performing with right hand fingers.

On the song &quot;Stuck&quot;, Borland used a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar. Borland&#x27;s playing on this album features octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes and hypnotic, droning licks to create a disorienting effect. 

Despite the success of live performances of the band&#x27;s cover of George Michael&#x27;s song &quot;Faith&quot;, Robinson was opposed to recording the cover, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed Robinson. Robinson also bonded with Borland, who Robinson perceived as not taking the band seriously. 

American rock band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album&#x27;s sound, particularly in the song &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;, which contains a breakdown in which Durst copied the singing of Maynard James Keenan and the intro which has elements of &quot;Undertow&quot; hidden track &quot;Disgustipated&quot;. Durst said &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot; is about his mother: &quot;When my mom used to ground me and I got upset, she&#x27;d say, &#x27;Oh, nobody loves me. I&#x27;m going to go eat worms.&#x27; So it was like this saying that I used to get pounded with by my mother. She had this little cross-snitch on the wall that said &#x27;Nobody loves me. Everybody hates me. I think I&#x27;ll go eat worms.&#x27; Here&#x27;s how I look at it: since nobody loves me, I don&#x27;t owe you a thing.&quot; 

&quot;Indigo Flow&quot;, named after the studio &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; was recorded in (Indigo Ranch Studio), was Limp Bizkit&#x27;s gratitude toward those who helped the band get a record deal and make music professionally. 

The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Borland later stated was part of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s plan to get noticed. &quot;The best way to get our message across is through shock value. That&#x27;s what grabs people [...] getting people to react by showing something negative, hoping something positive will come out of it. Trying to stay in reality.&quot; &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; has been described as nu metal, rap metal, and rapcore.

==Release, touring and promotion==
&quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; was released by Interscope Records on July 1, 1997. Between September 1997 and October 1997, Limp Bizkit opened for Faith No More on the American leg of their Album of the Year Tour, which was the group&#x27;s final tour before their break up the following year. Despite citing Faith No More as an influence, guitarist Wes Borland has spoken of how touring with them was a negative experience for the band, with Faith No More&#x27;s fans booing Limp Bizkit off stage at several shows. He said, &quot;The idea of it was cool, we were really excited about it, about the &quot;idea&quot; of opening for Faith No More. But once we got there, it was a really tough crowd. They have a really tough crowd to please, who are very vocal about not liking you. We opened for Faith No More and Primus in the same year, and the Primus tour went a lot better than the Faith No More tour. I did not get to know Mike Patton on that tour, I got to know him later [through Adam from Tool].&quot; At one show opening for Faith No More, Fred Durst referred to the audience as &quot;faggots&quot; when they started booing Limp Bizkit. Following this show, Durst apologized to Faith No More&#x27;s keyboardist Roddy Bottum, who, unbeknownst to him, had come out as gay in the early 1990s. At another show with Faith No More, bassist Sam Rivers was so frustrated at the booing that he ended up smashing his instrument at the end of their set. In October 1997, the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; gave Limp Bizkit&#x27;s live shows a negative review, writing &quot;In 1997, seeing some twentysomething kid sputter and curse about his problems just isn&#x27;t very shocking — or very interesting.&quot; Between March and June 1997, before the album&#x27;s release, Limp Bizkit had toured North America and Europe with Korn and Helmet, two other artists they cite as influences. This was also Helmet&#x27;s last tour before their initial break up the following year, with DJ Lethal having earlier collaborated with them on the 1993 song &quot;Just Another Victim&quot;, when he was in House of Pain. 

The music video for &quot;Counterfeit&quot; was released in 1997 and played on music channels like The Box and M2. Limp Bizkit performed on MTV&#x27;s 1998 Spring Break special &quot;Fashionably Loud&quot;, which brought the band attention. A music video was later made for the single &quot;Sour&quot;. Durst directed a music video for the band&#x27;s single &quot;Faith&quot; in promotion for its appearance in the film &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;, but was unsatisfied with it, and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones, and Mötley Crüe, who appeared in the video. The music video for &quot;Faith&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV and ended up on the MTV show &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The album&#x27;s popularity grew in 1999 as the band&#x27;s mainstream profile began to increase. In March of that year, it went platinum in the United States, and it eventually went double platinum in July 2001. As of October 1999, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; sold 1.8 million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Controversy==
In 1998, controversy came about when it was revealed Interscope paid $5,000 to guarantee that a radio station in Portland, Oregon play the song &quot;Counterfeit&quot; 50 times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope. The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as &quot;payola&quot;. However, &quot;payola&quot; specifically refers to songs played on the radio in which they are not disclosed as paid air time. Jeff Kwatinetz, the band&#x27;s manager, later termed the plan as a &quot;brilliant marketing move&quot;. Durst stated, &quot;It worked, but it&#x27;s not that cool of a thing.&quot; The payola controversy hurt Limp Bizkit&#x27;s image. Despite criticism, the paid air time did not increase sales, which stood at only 170,000 in early 1998. Much of the album&#x27;s resulting sales instead came from consistent touring by the band.

&quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; received controversy for its lyrical content, with the lyrics often being labeled as misogynistic. Durst said: &quot;That&#x27;s because I said the words whore and bitch. My whole record is about my girlfriend who put me through the wringer for three years and my insecurity about it. It became this big thing.&quot; Durst also said: &quot;Somebody may hear the word &#x27;bitch&#x27; on our songs, but I love women. I will always be ready for my soul mate to fall into my lap. So those people who think it&#x27;s derogatory towards women are the people that aren&#x27;t listening to the words.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; received positive reviews from critics. A June 1997 review from the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; stated, &quot;Limp Bizkit has created a sound that will fast be incorporated into the hard rock genre—let&#x27;s call it grindhop. Even if the name doesn&#x27;t stick, Limp Bizkit will still appeal to anyone with an ear for innovative music.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album in his retrospective review, writing &quot;They might not have many original ideas [...] but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting.&quot; In &quot;The Essential Rock Discography&quot;, Martin Charles Strong gave the album a 7 out of 10 rating. Robert Christgau gave the album a negative review. Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the writer of the song &quot;Faith&quot;, hated Limp Bizkit&#x27;s cover and &quot;hates us for doing it&quot;. Durst, however, said: &quot;I heard that he loves the song. We asked him to perform &#x27;Faith&#x27; with us on New Year&#x27;s, but George thought he might come off looking funny. I wouldn&#x27;t make fun of him.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1997 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; also included it on their 2022 list of the &quot;10 essential rap metal albums&quot;. Despite publicly expressing his disdain for nu metal and his personal dislike of Durst, Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine spoke very positively about Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all$, praising Borland&#x27;s guitar work and the musicianship. Despite a widely publicized feud with Limp Bizkit, Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor also expressed much praise for the album, crediting it as an influence on Slipknot&#x27;s 1999 self-titled album.

<text>Anjar (meaning &quot;unresolved or running river&quot;); / ALA-LC: &quot;‘Anjar&quot;; also known as &quot;Hawsh Mousa&quot; ( / &quot;Ḥawsh Mūsá&quot;), is a town of Lebanon, near the Syrian border, located in the Bekaa Valley. The population is 2,400, consisting almost entirely of Armenians. The total area is about twenty square kilometers (7.7 square miles). 
Since 1984, the ruins of the Umayyad settlement of Anjar have been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

==History==
The town&#x27;s foundation is generally attributed to the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I, at the beginning of the 8th century, as a palace-city. Syriac graffiti found in the quarry from which the best stone was extracted offer the year 714, and Byzantine and Syriac sources attribute the establishment of the town to Umayyad princes, with one Syriac chronicle mentioning Walid I by name, while the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor recorded that it was Walid&#x27;s son, al-Abbas, who started building the town in 709–10. Historian Jere L. Bacharach accepts Theophanes&#x27; date. Although earlier materials were re-used, much of the city is built on virgin soil.

After being abandoned in later years, Anjar was resettled in 1939 with several thousand Armenian refugees from the Musa Dagh area. Its neighborhoods are named after the six villages of Musa Dagh: Haji Habibli, Kebusiyeh, Vakif, Kheder Bek, Yoghunoluk and Bitias.

During the civil war, the Syrian Army chose Anjar as one of its main military bases in the Beqaa Valley and the headquarters of its intelligence services.

Following the civil war, Anjar started to rebuild economically. Many of its inhabitants immigrated to other countries, mainly to Europe, Canada, and the United States. Nevertheless, today Anjar is an example to many other entities in the region because of its low crime rate, reduced air pollution, and living standards. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the village rapidly imposed strict measures and set an example for the rest of the country.

In November 2024, UNESCO gave Anjar enhanced protection to safeguard against damage to the archaeological site during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.

==UNESCO World Heritage Site==

The Umayyad city ruins cover 114,000 square meters and are surrounded by large, fortified stone walls over two meters thick and seven meters high. The rectangular city design of 370 m by 310 m is based on Roman city planning and architecture with stonework borrowed from the Byzantines. Two large avenues, the Cardo maximum, running north to south, and the Decumanus Maximus, running east to west, divide the city into four quadrants. The two main avenues, decorated with colonnades and flanked by about 600 shops, intersect under
a tetrapylon. The plinths, shafts and capitals of the tetrapylon are spolia reused in the Umayyad period. Smaller streets subdivide the western half of the city in quarters of different size.

Main monuments:
* The partially rebuilt Grand Palace, 59 m by 70 m, includes a wall and is preceded by a series of arcades. Its central hosh (courtyard) is surrounded by a peristyle.
* The almost square Small Palace, 46 m by 47 m, stands out for its numerous ornamental fragments and its richly decorated central entrance.
* A Mosque, 45 m by 32 m, is located between the two palaces.
* Thermal baths, built on the Roman model.

==Demographics==

The majority of Anjar&#x27;s Armenians are Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox) who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church and Holy See of Cilicia. Armenian Apostolic Saint Paul Church is the second largest Armenian church in Lebanon.

The Armenian Apostolic community has its own school, Haratch Calouste Gulbenkian Secondary School. In 1940, the chief editor of the Armenian newspaper &quot;Haratch&quot; in Paris, Shavarsh Missakian, organized a fundraising campaign among the Armenians living in France which enabled the building of the &quot;Haratch&quot; Elementary School next to the newly established St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church. The official opening of the school took place in 1941. The administration of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation contributed to the expansion of the school, which was named in honor of Calouste Gulbenkian.

Our Lady of the Rosary Armenian Catholic Church in Anjar serves as church for the Armenian Catholics, who also run the Armenian Catholic Sisters School. In the beginning, the school had two divisions, St. Hovsep for the male students and Sisters of Immaculate Conception for the female students. In 1954, these departments were united. 1973 saw the official opening of the Aghajanian Orphan House, already serving as an Armenian Catholic orphanage since 1968.

The Armenian Evangelical Church of Anjar is in operation to serve Anjar&#x27;s small Armenian Evangelical community. The Protestant community school was established in 1948 by Sister Hedwig Aenishänslein as part of her missionary work in Anjar. In 1953, the school, which had already become an intermediate school, was promoted into a secondary school. It has day classes as well as boarding facilities for students from other regions who stay there throughout the winter.

==Economy==
Anjar&#x27;s economy is mostly based on services, with very few agricultural and industrial activities. The biggest private employer is the company &quot;Shams&quot; (literally &quot;Sun&quot;), a local family-run business that started out as a small restaurant in the 1960s. 

The municipality is also an important employer. It pays salaries for teachers, public servants, and law enforcement personnel. Unlike the rest of the country, where policing is provided by the central government, Anjar has its own municipal police wearing dark green uniforms and reporting to the municipality instead of the ministry of internal affairs.

<text>Müller&#x27;s gibbon (Hylobates muelleri), also known as the southern grey gibbon, is a primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae.

== Taxonomy ==
Formerly, the western grey gibbon (&quot;H. abbotti&quot;) and eastern grey gibbon (&quot;H. funereus&quot;) were considered conspecific with &quot;H. muelleri&quot;, but more recent studies indicate that all three are distinct species, and both the IUCN Red List and the American Society of Mammalogists consider them such.

==Description==
Unlike most gibbon species, Müller&#x27;s gibbon does not show sexual dimorphism in its fur coloration. Its fur is grey- or brown-colored with a ring of bright fur around its face. On the head, it often has a darkly colored cap. Weighing between 4–8 kg, it ranks among the smaller of the gibbons.

==Distribution and habitat==
Müller&#x27;s gibbon is endemic to Kalimantan in the island of Borneo, inhabiting the southeastern part of the island. It is found approximately south of the Mahakam River and east of the Barito River.

==Behaviour==
Southern grey gibbons are diurnal rain forest dwellers, characterized by the long arms that all gibbons have, with which they brachiate through the trees. They live together in monogamous pairs, and defend their family territory against intruders with long, loud singing. Their diet consists primarily of fruits. Little is known about the reproductive patterns of this species, but it is thought to be similar to that of other gibbon species.

<doc id="1317292" wikidata="Q1251907" url="?curid=1317292" title="Doughboy">
<text>&quot;Doughboy&quot; was a popular nickname for the American infantryman during World War I. Though the origins of the term are not certain, the nickname was still in use as of the early 1940s, when it was gradually replaced by &quot;G.I.&quot; as the following generation enlisted in World War II

== Background ==
=== Philology ===
The origins of the term are unclear. The word was in wide circulation a century earlier in both Britain and America, albeit with different meanings. Horatio Nelson&#x27;s sailors and the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s soldiers in Spain, for instance, were both familiar with fried flour dumplings called &quot;doughboys&quot;, the precursor of the modern doughnut. Independently, in the United States, the term had come to be applied to bakers&#x27; young apprentices, i.e., &quot;dough-boys&quot;. In &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), Herman Melville nicknamed the timorous cabin steward &quot;Doughboy&quot;.

===Average age===
Infantrymen recruited for World War I were very young, often teenaged boys. The average age of a &quot;doughboy&quot; in World War I was less than 25 years old. Fifty-seven percent of infantrymen were under the age of 25, with some enlisting as young as seventeen.

== History ==
Doughboy as applied to the infantry of the U.S. Army first appears in accounts of the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848, without any precedent that can be documented. A number of theories have been put forward to explain this usage:
* Cavalrymen used the term to deride foot soldiers, because the brass buttons on their uniforms looked like the flour dumplings or dough cakes called &quot;doughboys&quot;, or because of the flour or pipe clay which the soldiers used to polish their white belts.
* Observers noticed U.S. infantry forces were constantly covered with chalky dust from marching through the dry terrain of northern Mexico, giving the men the appearance of unbaked dough or the mud bricks of the area known as adobe, with &quot;adobe&quot; transformed to &#x27;dobies&#x27; and then further into &quot;doughboy&quot;.
* The soldiers&#x27; method of cooking field rations of the 1840s and 1850s into doughy flour-and-rice concoctions baked in the ashes of a camp fire. This does not explain why only infantrymen received the appellation.

One explanation offered for the usage of the term in World War I is that female Salvation Army volunteers went to France to cook millions of doughnuts and bring them to the troops on the front line, although this explanation ignores the usage of the term in the earlier war. One jocular explanation for the term&#x27;s origin was that, in World War I, the doughboys were &quot;kneaded&quot; in 1914 but did not rise until 1917.

=== Postwar ===
Examples from the Interwar and WW2 eras include the 1942 song &quot;Johnny Doughboy Found a Rose in Ireland&quot;, recorded by Dennis Day, Kenny Baker, and Kay Kyser, among others, the 1942 musical film &quot;Johnny Doughboy&quot;, and the character &quot;Johnny Doughboy&quot; in &quot;Military Comics&quot;.

== Monuments and memorials ==
A popular mass-produced sculpture of the 1920s called the &quot;Spirit of the American Doughboy&quot; shows a U.S. soldier in World War I uniform.

In September of 2024, the National World War I Memorial unveiled a sculpture called &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Journey&quot; which depicts a single “doughboy” as he leaves home, witnesses death and destruction on the front lines and makes his way back.

<doc id="1317313" wikidata="Q869740" url="?curid=1317313" title="Crispin Tickell">
<text>Sir Crispin Charles Cervantes Tickell (25 August 1930 – 25 January 2022) was a British diplomat, environmentalist, and academic.

==Background==

Tickell was born in London, the son of writer Jerrard Tickell and Renée (née Haynes), a great-granddaughter of Thomas Henry Huxley. He was educated at Westminster School where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar, and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1952 with first class honours in Modern History. He did his national service in the Coldstream Guards as a 2nd Lieutenant from 1952 to 1954.

==Diplomatic career==

Tickell joined the British diplomatic service in 1954, serving at the Foreign Office Main Building in London until 1955. He was responsible for looking after the British Antarctic Territory; the experience gained may have laid the foundations for long-term interests in the environment. He then had a posting at the British Embassy in The Hague (1955–58); Mexico City (1958–61); London (1961–64); Paris (1964–70); and Private Secretary to various Chancellors of the Duchy of Lancaster (1970–72) during negotiations for the UK entry into the European Community. He was later Chef de Cabinet to the President of the European Commission (1977–1980), British Ambassador to Mexico (1981–1983), Permanent Secretary of the Overseas Development Administration (now Department for International Development) (1984–1987), and British Ambassador to the United Nations and Permanent Representative on the UN Security Council (1987–1990).

He was appointed MVO in 1958 and later knighted as a KCVO in 1983 on the Royal Yacht Britannia, to mark the conclusion of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Official Visit to Mexico. He was appointed GCMG for his work at the UN in 1988.

===Spying at U.N. headquarters debate===
When Clare Short, former international development secretary in Blair&#x27;s Cabinet, said that British intelligence bugged the office of Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, Tickell refused to comment on the accuracy of Short&#x27;s claim, saying he had a continuing duty of loyalty to governments past and present and told the BBC, &quot;What I would say is I would not be surprised if in New York there is a great deal of listening all over the place from one country to another, and I don&#x27;t know whether it really makes very much difference. My conscience is quite clear about these matters and I would not think it necessarily a bad thing at all if it is in the national interest.&quot; Tickell added, &quot;Our friends and allies may indeed be doing something like that themselves.&quot; 

Tickell also criticized Short for resigning from her position of Secretary for International Development in protest of Tony Blair&#x27;s entry into the Iraq War in May 2003 and reprimanded her: &quot;your prime loyalty is to your employer and, indeed, to the interests of the country.&quot;

==Academic career==
Tickell was President of the Royal Geographical Society from 1990 to 1993 and Warden of Green College, Oxford, between 1990 and 1997, where he appointed George Monbiot and Norman Myers as Visiting Fellows. Green College merged with Templeton College in 2008 to become Green Templeton College, located at what was previously Green College.

He was President of the Marine Biological Association from 1990 to 2001. From 1996 until August 2006 he was chancellor of the University of Kent when Sir Robert Worcester took over the position. He was director of the Policy Foresight Programme of the James Martin 21st Century School at the University of Oxford (formerly the Green College Centre for Environmental Policy and Understanding) and Chairman Emeritus of the Climate Institute, in Washington D.C. He has many interests, including climate change, population issues, conservation of biodiversity, and the early history of the Earth.

Margaret Thatcher credited Tickell with persuading her to make a speech on global climate change to the Royal Society in September 1988 (though the speech was written by Thatcher and George Guise). 

He chaired John Major&#x27;s Government Panel on Sustainable Development (1994–2000), and was a member of two government task forces under the Labour Party: one on urban regeneration, chaired by Sir Richard Rogers, later Lord Rogers (1998–99), and one on potentially hazardous near-Earth objects (2000).

He was an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Public impact==
A man of strong environmental convictions, he was described as having been influential in Britain, although his environmental message did not always travel as easily abroad, particularly to the United States. His 1977 book &quot;Climatic Change and World Affairs&quot; argued that mandatory international pollution control would eventually be necessary. Despite his non-scientific background, he was internationally respected as having had a strong grasp of science policy issues. He was the recipient, between 1990 and 2006, of 23 honorary doctorates.

He was the president of the UK charity Tree Aid, which enables communities in Africa&#x27;s drylands to fight poverty and become self-reliant, while improving the environment. He was also a patron of population concern charity Population Matters, (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust), and told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme that the ideal population for Britain could be around 20 million. As a member of Lord Rogers&#x27; Urban Task Force, Tickell counselled against spreading cities saying that we need denser living, that young adults should not expect to leave home straight away, and that older relatives could live in &quot;granny flats&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Sir Crispin lived in a converted barn in the Cotswolds. He married Chloe Gunn in 1954 but the marriage was dissolved in 1976. He had two sons and one daughter from this marriage. The following year, he married Penelope Thorne. His main recreations included climatology, paleohistory, pre-Columbian art, and mountains. His son is Oliver Tickell, former editor of &quot;The Ecologist&quot;.

Tickell died from pneumonia on 25 January 2022, at the age of 91.

<doc id="1317321" wikidata="Q6473740" url="?curid=1317321" title="Laid (album)">
<text>Laid is the fifth studio album by British rock band James. It was released on 27 September 1993 through Fontana Records. The album&#x27;s sound, which is &quot;stripped-down&quot; compared to their prior releases, was inspired by their recent experience touring as supporting act to Neil Young. Enlisting Brian Eno as producer, James recorded for six weeks at The Windings in Wrexham, Wales, and Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire. The sessions also resulted in the experimental sixth studio album &quot;Wah Wah&quot; (1994). &quot;Laid&quot; is a folk and pop rock album that was reminiscent of their earlier releases with its atmosphere and minimal arrangements.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot;, was released on 30 August 1993. Bolstered by the song&#x27;s success, James toured the US as part of the WOMAD festival. &quot;Laid&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on 1 November 1993. The band toured the UK the following month, supported Duran Duran in the US, and finally embarked on their own US tour. &quot;Laid&quot; has been re-pressed on vinyl three times; it was reissued on CD in 2001, in 2015 as a standalone release, and as part of a box set with &quot;Wah Wah&quot;. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom commented on Eno&#x27;s production. It peaked at number three in the UK and charted in Australia and the US. It was later certified gold in the UK and the US, as was the eponymous track in the UK. &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; and &quot;Laid&quot; both charted in the UK top 40 and &quot;Laid&quot; peaked at number 67 on the Hot 100. &quot;Laid&quot; appeared on best-of album lists compiled by &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Select,&quot; while the eponymous song appeared on best-song-of-the-decade lists by &quot;PopMatters&quot; and uDiscoverMusic.

==Background and writing==
James&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Seven&quot;, which was released in February 1992, sold a million copies worldwide. It peaked at number two in the UK with three of its four singles – &quot;Sound&quot;, &quot;Born of Frustration&quot;, and &quot;Ring the Bells&quot; – reaching the top 40 of the UK singles chart. &quot;Born of Frustration&quot; was successful on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay chart, where it reached number five. The band headlined their only United Kingdom show of 1992 to a crowd of 30,000 at the Alton Towers leisure park.

Following this, trumpeter Andy Diagram, who wanted to have other opportunities and missed his girlfriend, left the band, which continued as a six-piece outfit. James supported Neil Young on nine of his US west-coast shows with an acoustic set. They continued touring the US, playing acoustic instead of electric shows as they had intended. Their record company was angered by this decision and threatened to withdraw funding for the tour, but changed their mind after a staff member attended a show. After returning to the UK, James started writing material for their next album.

==Production==

James wanted to work with producer Brian Eno since their debut studio album &quot;Stutter&quot; (1986). Vocalist Tim Booth said Eno was &quot;a bit busy and he&#x27;d call back in a couple of years.&quot; The band sent Eno a letter and six hours&#x27; worth of rehearsal tapes. Eno listened to the tapes while on holiday after his wife said she was a fan of James. He became interested in the band after hearing a rough version of &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot;. In August 1992, Eno telephoned the band, saying he liked their music and went to the UK to work with them. In early 1993, Eno and engineer Benedict Fenner visited the band at their practice space, Beehive Mill in Manchester, to witness their productivity over three-to-four days. Eno made recordings of the rehearsals to assess the quality of the songwriting. Recording for &quot;Laid&quot; began in February 1993, initially for one week at drummer David Baynton-Power&#x27;s studio The Windings in Wrexham, then five more weeks at Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire. In comparison to &quot;Seven&quot;, which took several months to record, the six-week recording schedule was intended to provoke spontaneity and capitalized on Eno&#x27;s limited availability of four days a week. 
Eno arrived at the studio two hours earlier than everyone else so he could listen to the rehearsal tapes. From the hours of recordings, Eno picked out potential ideas he wanted expanded into fully-produced songs. Booth said some of the ideas lasted as little as 20 seconds, and that &quot;Skindiving&quot; and &quot;Dream Thrum&quot; grew from these ideas. Booth said Eno felt the band &quot;completely neglected&quot; the songs &quot;Dream Thrum&quot;, &quot;Laid&quot;, and &quot;Five-O&quot;. Fenner handled most of the recording; he and Eno were assisted by engineer Ben &#x27;Jude&#x27; Findlay. &quot;P.S.&quot; was recorded by Steve &#x27;Doc&#x27; Williams with assistance from Mike Jones and additional recording by Fenner. One day, when Eno was not in the studio, guitarist Larry Gott took on his role and the band recorded &quot;One of the Three&quot;, which Eno did not like. During the sessions, Eno had a second studio set up so the band could experiment during downtime. The results of this were later released as the album &quot;Wah Wah&quot; (1994). Gott said Eno had tapes continuously recording during the process in case they came up with an idea they liked. Bassist Jim Glennie said Eno often encouraged them to experiment, making them &quot;realise that this imperfection was a good thing&quot;. Fenner mixed most of the recordings except for &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; and &quot;Low Low Low&quot;, both of which were mixed by Markus Dravs.

==Composition and lyrics==
The folk and pop rock sound of &quot;Laid&quot; recalls the band&#x27;s earlier material and has a dreamier atmosphere with sparse arrangements. Booth said the band&#x27;s acoustic touring with Young influenced the album; &quot;You&#x27;re naked, you&#x27;re vulnerable, but it&#x27;s exhilarating ... It&#x27;s not an acoustic record, but it&#x27;s a stripped down sound&quot;. Eno contributed additional bass and keyboards to the recordings; he and Martine McDonagh, the band&#x27;s manager and Booth&#x27;s former partner, sang additional vocals on &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot;, &quot;Dream Thrum&quot;, and &quot;Five-O&quot;.

&quot;Out to Get You&quot; was originally recorded as the B-side to &quot;Lose Control&quot; (1990), which James forgot about until reviving it for the tour with Young. When they were working on the song in the studio, the band attempted to add overdubs. Booth said this changed the feeling of the track so they reverted to the first take of the song. &quot;Out to Get You&quot; sets the tone for the rest of album with Glennie&#x27;s octave notes, Gott&#x27;s blues-lite guitar parts, and minimal percussion from Baynton-Power. The song&#x27;s first-person narrator rues a love over which he is paranoid. &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; is the most rock-centric track on the album with its fast-paced acoustic strumming. The &quot;Lester Piggott&quot; part is inspired by the jockey of the same name, which Booth said was &quot;because it has a racing beat&quot;. During recording, Eno &quot;went white and sat down&quot; as Booth sang, later stating he had &quot;just experienced one of the highlights of my musical life&quot;. Booth had difficulty writing lyrics he liked for &quot;Dream Thrum&quot;. He eventually settled on talking about the effect of culture on individual personality and life choices. It is the only song on album on which keyboardist Mark Hunter played another instrument (a melodica) as well as keyboards.

&quot;One of the Three&quot; is inspired by the experiences of John McCarthy, Brian Keenan, and Terry Waite, who were taken as hostages in Lebanon, and by a scene in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1953) in which three characters are on crosses. The band subdued the sound of the pop-leaning &quot;Say Something&quot; because they felt it would be distasteful to put too much emotion behind it. The song, which was written by Booth after an argument, discusses first love and is indebted to the work of U2. 

The folk influenced track &quot;Five-O&quot; is about a belief in the narrator&#x27;s partner in a long-term relationship. &quot;P.S.&quot;, which is about a failing relationship, is a demo recording the band felt they could not improve upon; the full version ran for eight minutes before it was reduced. &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; is about helping a depressed person; Glennie said it was planned to appear on &quot;Wah Wah&quot; but was moved to &quot;Laid&quot; because the band wanted crossover between releases. &quot;Knuckle Too Far&quot; evolved from a jam session the band had with Bruce Mitchell of the Durutti Column. Originally known as &quot;Bruce Jam,&quot; Glennie said this version was &quot;very sparse with nothing going on&quot;. The band forgot about the song for nine months. As the band struggled to reinvent it in the studio, they thought about putting that version on the album. Finally, Booth and Gott, unable to hear each other through their monitors, ran through the song again and ended up with a satisfactory version through what Gott described as &quot;this curious kind of miscommunication&quot;.

Booth said &quot;Low Low Low&quot; was influenced by the idea only one gene separates humans from apes; he said, &quot;I swing from seeing human beings as apes to seeing them as divine depending on what day you catch me&quot;. The song&#x27;s chorus includes catering staff of Real World – dubbed the Kitchenettes – singing in unison. &quot;Laid&quot; features Gott on slide guitar for the first time since &quot;Really Heard&quot; from &quot;Stutter&quot;. The song, which comments on sexuality, was inspired by Booth witnessing several relationships that were happening around him. The band initially discarded the song for sounding too much like pop until Eno encouraged the band to continue working on it. Booth&#x27;s rushed vocals are the result of attempting to encapsulate &quot;that feeling of an intense relationship [that is] out of control&quot;. The version that appeared on the album is an early demo that was recorded at The Windings. &quot;Lullaby&quot;, which was originally called &quot;Just Human&quot;, tackles the effects of child abuse suffered by a friend of Booth&#x27;s. The album closes with &quot;Skindiving&quot;, an ambient track that is about a person delving deeply into a certain frame of mind.

==Release==
Partway through the recording process, James played a one-off show in Bath, Somerset, where they debuted many of the album&#x27;s tracks. James supported Young at Finsbury Park, London, on 8 July 1993. The band then performed at the WOMAD festival on 28 August 1993 and travelled across the US with the festival. &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; was released as a single on 30 August 1993 with &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Building a Charge&quot; as extra tracks. The music video for &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; was directed by Tim Pope. It expanded on the song&#x27;s water theme and depicts the band miming the lyrics in a water tank at Pinewood Studios. McDonagh starred in the video, standing in as an extra guitarist.

&quot;Laid&quot; was released in the UK on 27 September 1993 through Fontana Records. The album&#x27;s cover artwork depicts the band members wearing dresses and eating bananas in front of the Marseille Cathedral in Marseille, France. James were on a three-day photograph session when Booth suggested they put on dresses for a few pictures. They snacked on bananas as they awaited their manager&#x27;s return with food. Despite having already-completed cover art, they decided to use the images from Marseille once they saw them. Glennie joked the audience &quot;could read into it as a subtext about prostituting ourselves by selling what we do&quot;.

Booth and Eno wanted the outtake &quot;The Lake&quot; on &quot;Laid&quot; but were outvoted by the rest of the band. The song, as well as &quot;America&quot;, was included on the Japanese edition of the album. &quot;Laid&quot; was released as a single with &quot;Wah Wah Kits&quot;, &quot;The Lake&quot;, and &quot;Seconds Away&quot; on 1 November 1993. The following week, a second version of the single, including live versions of &quot;Laid&quot;, &quot;Five-O&quot;, &quot;Say Something&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott),&quot; was released. Zanna directed the music video for &quot;Laid&quot;, in which Booth is handcuffed in a laundromat as the other band members enter and leave. In December 1993, the band went on their first tour of the UK in two years. In January 1994, the band supported Duran Duran on a tour of the US, before embarking on their own headlining tour in February and March 1994.

&quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot;, &quot;Say Something&quot;, and &quot;Laid&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s first and fourth compilation albums, &quot;The Best Of&quot; (1998) and &quot;Fresh as a Daisy – The Singles&quot; (2007). &quot;Out to Get You&quot;, &quot;Five-O&quot;, and &quot;Laid&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s third compilation album &quot;The Collection&quot; (2004). The music videos for &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot;, &quot;Say Something&quot; (two versions), and &quot;Laid&quot; were included on the career-spanning box set &quot;The Gathering Sound&quot; (2012). &quot;Laid&quot; was reissued on CD in 2001, with the addition of live versions of &quot;Laid&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, and &quot;Five-O&quot;, and a remix of &quot;Say Something&quot;. &quot;Laid&quot; was re-pressed on vinyl in 1999, 2015, and 2020. It was released in 2015 in a deluxe box set (with &quot;Wah Wah&quot;) alongside numerous alternative takes, demos, and radio sessions. The same year, &quot;Laid&quot; was reissued on its own with a disc of highlights from the box set.

==Reception==

&quot;Laid&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett wrote that the album&#x27;s quieter sound &quot;turned out not merely to be a nice way to undercut expectations, but a creative benchmark for the group, arguably its artistic peak&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; writer Paul Davies called it as &quot;striking, provocative and sharply melodic as its predecessor&quot;, aided by Eno&#x27;s &quot;lean, stripped down sound&quot;. &quot;Select&quot; Andrew Harrison said the album&#x27;s &quot;real joy&quot; is its &quot;supernatural musical landscape,&quot; adding the band that were &quot;hated when they knocked their corners off for the arenas is nowhere to be heard&quot;. Ian Gittins of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said the album features &quot;reflective, introspective musings with a heartening assurance, and mixes yearning and intelligence with a naked honesty which at times is genuinely stunning.&quot; He considered it a &quot;remarkable rebirth&quot; and said the band had &quot;regained all the artistic ground they lost&quot; with their previous album while managing to make &quot;their strongest work&quot; since their third studio album, &quot;Gold Mother&quot; (1990).

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Josef Woodard said the &quot;[q]uirky numbers blend with dream interludes and droll carnality in this juicy alternative to the Alternative Parade.&quot; BBC Music reviewer Ian Wade wrote the album is full of &quot;solid songwriting, showcasing James at their finest, relaxing into their own skins.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Mark Jenkins liked Eno&#x27;s attempt to &quot;recapture some of the delicacy of the band&#x27;s initial work&quot;, offering up an album that is &quot;not quite so bombastic as its immediate predecessors.&quot; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; contributor James Herbert noted while Booth&#x27;s &quot;acerbic observations and wounded-troubadour vocals wend through all 13 tracks&quot;, they are mainly &quot;set to more brooding tunes that burble with atmosphere&quot;, and that Eno &quot;indulge[d] in too much atmospheric dabbling.&quot; Johnny Dee of &quot;NME&quot; disliked Eno&#x27;s production for &quot;strip[ping] the songs of personality, and zip, inadvertently creating un-songs&quot;, and said these &quot;sleep-inducing meanderings lull the listener into such a smoky kind of boredom.&quot; &quot;The Audiophile Voice&quot; Mark Block expressed a similar sentiment: &quot;I find the &#x27;atmos&#x27; a little too smoky for my taste, but did it get in the way? No, but just barely&quot;. &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; writer Don McSwiney, meanwhile, praised Eno&#x27;s work, as it made the band come across a &quot;lot slicker, its rougher edges smoothed out and replaced with BIG production values likely with an eye to capitalizing on the modest success of its last effort&quot;.

&quot;Laid&quot; charted at number three in the UK, number 72 in the US, and number 86 in Australia. It was certified gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry and in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America. By 2001, &quot;Laid&quot; had sold 539,000 copies in the US. &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; charted at number 18 in the UK and number 119 in Australia. &quot;Laid&quot; charted at number 25 in the UK and number 40 in Australia. In the US, &quot;Laid&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay chart, at number 57 on the Radio Songs chart, and number 61 on the Hot 100. &quot;Laid&quot; was certified platinum by the BPI in 2021, and was included on lists of the decade&#x27;s best songs compiled by &quot;PopMatters&quot; and &quot;uDiscoverMusic&quot;. &quot;Clash&quot; included &quot;Out to Get You&quot; and &quot;Sometimes (Lester Piggott)&quot; on their list of the top 10 best James songs.

<text>In finance, a contract for difference (CFD) is a financial agreement between two parties, commonly referred to as the &quot;buyer&quot; and the &quot;seller.&quot; The contract stipulates that the buyer will pay the seller the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at the time the contract was initiated. If the asset&#x27;s price increases from the opening to the closing of the contract, the seller compensates the buyer for the increase, which constitutes the buyer&#x27;s profit. Conversely, if the asset&#x27;s price decreases, the buyer compensates the seller, resulting in a profit for the seller.

==History==
===Invention===
Developed in Britain in 1974 as a way to leverage gold, modern CFDs have been trading widely since the early 1990s. CFDs were originally developed as a type of equity swap that was traded on margin. The invention of the CFD is widely credited to Brian Keelan and Jon Wood, both of UBS Warburg, on their Trafalgar House deal in the early 1990s.

===Asset management and synthetic prime brokerage===
CFDs were initially used by hedge funds and institutional traders to cost-effectively gain an exposure to stocks on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), partly because they required only a small margin but also, since no physical shares changed hands, they also avoided stamp duty in the United Kingdom—trades by the prime broker for its own account, for hedging purposes, are exempt from stamp duty.

It remains common for hedge funds and other asset managers to use CFDs as an alternative to physical holdings (or physical short selling) for UK-listed equities, with similar risk and leverage profiles. A hedge fund&#x27;s prime broker will act as the counterparty to CFD, and will often hedge its own risk under the CFD (or its net risk under all CFDs held by its clients, long and short) by trading physical shares on the exchange.

Institutional traders started to use CFDs to hedge stock exposure and avoid taxes. Several firms began marketing CFDs to retail traders in the late 1990s, stressing their leverage and tax-free status in the UK. A number of service providers expanded their products beyond the London Stock Exchange to include global stocks, commodities, bonds, and currencies. Index CFDs, which were based on key global indexes including the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500, FTSE, and DAX, immediately gained popularity.

===Retail trading===
In the late 1990s, CFDs were introduced to retail traders. They were popularized by a number of UK companies, characterized by innovative online trading platforms that made it easy to see live prices and trade in real-time. The first company to do this was GNI (originally known as Gerrard &amp; National Intercommodities).

GNI provided retail stock traders with the opportunity to trade CFDs on LSE stocks through its innovative front-end electronic trading system, GNI Touch, via a home computer connected to the Internet. GNI&#x27;s retail service created the basis for retail stock traders to trade directly onto the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service (SETS) central limit order book at the LSE through a process known as direct market access (DMA). For example, if a retail trader sent an order to buy a stock CFD, GNI would sell the CFD to the trader and then buy the equivalent stock position from the marketplace as a full hedge.

GNI and its CFD trading service GNI Touch was later acquired by MF Global. They were soon followed by IG Markets and CMC Markets, which started to popularize the service in 2000. Subsequently, European CFD providers such as Saxo Bank and Australian CFD providers such as Macquarie Bank and Prudential made significant progress in establishing global CFD markets.

Around 2001, a number of the CFD providers realized that CFDs had the same economic effect as financial spread betting in the UK, except that spread betting profits were exempt from capital gains tax. Most CFD providers launched financial spread betting operations in parallel to their CFD offering. In the UK, the CFD market mirrors the financial spread betting market and the products are in many ways the same; the FCA defines spread betting as &quot;a contract for differences that is a gaming contract&quot;. However, unlike CFDs, which have been exported to a number of different countries, spread betting, which relies on a country-specific tax advantage, has remained primarily limited to the UK and Ireland.

CFD providers then started to expand to overseas markets, starting with Australia in July 2002 by IG Markets (first CFD provider to be licensed by ASIC) and CMC Markets. CFDs have since been introduced into a number of other countries. They are available in most European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, and New Zealand, throughout South America and others. They are not permitted in a number of other countries – most notably the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) prohibit CFDs from being listed on regulated exchanges and being traded on foreign or domestic trading platforms due to their high risk. At the same time, a number of trading apps with various usage scenarios operate on the market, including eToro, Freetrade, Fidelity Personal Investing (part of Fidelity Investments) and Trading212.

CFDs are treated as a gambling product in Hong Kong unless they have been permitted by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which treats CFDs, where the underlying is a security, as futures contracts, that must be exchange-traded, effectively precluding their being offered in Hong Kong. However, the SCF has a separate regulatory regime for rolling spot FX contracts, which it terms leverage foreign exchange contracts. These can be offered to retail clients as an over-the-counter derivative. Brokers in Hong Kong can also offer CFDs on the spot price of precious metals, which aren&#x27;t regulated as securities, using prices derived from contracts trading on the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society.

In 2016 the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a warning on the sale of speculative products to retail investors that included the sale of CFDs.

===Attempt by Australian exchange to move to exchange trading===
The majority of CFDs are traded OTC using the &quot;direct market access&quot; (DMA) or &quot;market maker&quot; model, but from 2007 until June 2014 the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) offered exchange traded CFDs. As a result, a small percentage of CFDs were traded through the Australian exchange during this period.

The advantages and disadvantages of having an exchange traded CFD were similar for most financial products and meant reducing counterparty risk and increasing transparency but costs were higher. The disadvantages of the ASX exchange traded CFDs and lack of liquidity meant that most Australian traders opted for over-the-counter CFD providers

===Insider trading regulations===
In June 2009 the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the UK regulator, implemented a general disclosure regime for CFDs to avoid them being used in insider information cases. This was after a number of high-profile cases where positions in CFDs were used instead of physical underlying stock to exempt them from the normal insider information disclosure rules.

===Attempt at central clearing===
In October 2013, LCH.Clearnet in partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald, ING Bank and Commerzbank launched centrally cleared CFDs in line with the EU financial regulators&#x27; stated aim of increasing the proportion of cleared OTC contracts.

===European regulatory restrictions===
In 2016, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a warning on the sale of speculative products to retail investors that included the sale of CFDs. This was after they observed an increase in the marketing of these products at the same time as a rise in the number of complaints from retail investors who have suffered significant losses. Within Europe, any provider based in any member country can offer the products to all member countries under MiFID and many of the European financial regulators responded with new rules on CFDs after the warning. The majority of providers are based in either Cyprus or the UK and both countries&#x27; financial regulators were first to respond. CySEC the Cyprus financial regulator, where many of the firms are registered, increased the regulations on CFDs by limiting the maximum leverage to 50:1 as well prohibiting the paying of bonuses as sales incentives in November 2016. This was followed by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issuing a proposal for similar restrictions on 6 December 2016. The FCA imposed further restrictions on 1 August 2019 for CFDs and 1 September 2019 for CFD-like options with the maximum leverage being 30:1. The German regulator BaFin took a different approach and in response to the ESMA warning prohibited additional payments when a client made losses. While the French regulator Autorité des marchés financiers decided to ban all advertising of the CFDs. In March the Irish Financial Regulator followed suit and put out a proposal to either ban CFDs or implement limitations on leverage. Beyond Europe, other regions have also set specific leverage limits. In Australia, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has established leverage limits for retail CFD trading. In March 2021, ASIC reduced the maximum leverage ratio to 30:1.

==Electricity generation==
To support new low-carbon electricity generation in the United Kingdom, both nuclear and renewable contracts for difference were introduced by the Energy Act 2013, progressively replacing the previous Renewables Obligation scheme. A House of Commons Library report explained the scheme as:

In some countries, such as Turkey, the price may be fixed by the government rather than an auction.

===CFDs difference from FTR===

CFDs are different from financial transmission right (FTR) in two ways. First, a CFD is usually defined at a specific location, not between a pair of locations. Thus, CFDs are a tool principally for hedging temporal price risk – the variation in the nodal pricing or locational marginal pricing (LMP) over time at a specific location. Second, CFDs are not traded through regional transmission organizations (RTOs) markets. They are bilateral contracts between individual market participants.

==Risks==
===Market risk===
The main risk is market risk, as contract for difference trading is designed to pay the difference between the opening price and the closing price of the underlying asset. CFDs are traded on margin, which amplifies risk and reward via leverage. A 2016 UK Financial Conduct Authority analysis of a sample of client accounts for CFD firms found that 82% of clients lost money, with similar figures in European jurisdictions. Average loss was £2,200.

It is this risk that drives the use of CFDs, either for speculation in financial markets, or for profit in a falling market through hedging. One of the ways to mitigate this risk is the use of stop loss orders. Users typically deposit an amount of money with the CFD provider to cover the margin and can lose much more than this deposit if the market moves against them.

In the professional asset management industry, an investment vehicle&#x27;s portfolio will usually contain elements that offset the leverage inherent in CFDs when looking at leverage of the overall portfolio. In particular, the retention of cash holdings reduces the effective leverage of a portfolio: if an investment vehicle buys 100 shares for £10,000 in cash, this provides the same exposure to the shares as entering into a CFD for the same 100 shares with £500 of margin, and retaining £9,500 as a cash reserve. The use of CFDs in this context therefore does not necessarily imply an increased market exposure (and where there is an increased market exposure, it will generally be less than the headline leverage of the CFD).

===Liquidation risk===

If prices move against an open CFD position, additional variation margin is required to maintain the margin level. The CFD providers may call upon the party to deposit additional sums to cover this, in what is known as a margin call. In fast moving markets, margin calls may be at short notice. If funds are not provided in time, the CFD provider may close/liquidate the positions at a loss for which the other party is liable.

===Counterparty risk===
Another dimension of CFD risk is counterparty risk, a factor in most over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives. Counterparty risk is associated with the financial stability or solvency of the counterparty to a contract. In the context of CFD contracts, if the counterparty to a contract fails to meet their financial obligations, the CFD may have little or no value regardless of the underlying instrument. This means that a CFD trader could potentially incur severe losses, even if the underlying instrument moves in the desired direction. OTC CFD providers are required to segregate client funds protecting client balances in event of company default, but cases such as that of MF Global remind us that guarantees can be broken. Exchange-traded contracts traded through a clearing house are generally believed to have less counterparty risk. Ultimately, the degree of counterparty risk is defined by the credit risk of the counterparty, including the clearing house if applicable. This risk is heightened due to the fact that custody is linked to the company or bank supplying the trading.

==Comparison with other financial instruments==

There are a number of different financial instruments that have been used in the past to speculate on financial markets. These range from trading in physical shares either directly or via margin lending, to using derivatives such as futures, options or covered warrants. A number of brokers have been actively promoting CFDs as alternatives to all of these products.

The CFD market most resembles the futures and options market, the major differences being:

* There is no expiry date, so no time decay;
* Trading is done over-the-counter with CFD brokers or market makers;
* CFD contract is normally one to one with the underlying instrument;
* CFD trading is banned in Belgium (for OTC instruments only), the United States and Hong Kong;
* Minimum contract sizes are small, so it&#x27;s possible to buy one share CFD;
* Easy to create new instruments: not restricted to exchange definitions or jurisdictional boundaries, so very wide selection of underlying instruments can be traded.

===Futures===
CFDs and Futures trading are both forms of derivatives trading. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell the underlying asset at a set price at a set date in the future, regardless of how the price changes in the meanwhile. Professionals prefer future contracts for indices and interest rate trading over CFDs as they are a mature product and are exchange traded. The main advantages of CFDs, compared to futures, is that contract sizes are smaller making it more accessible for small traders and pricing is more transparent. Futures contracts tend to only converge to the price of the underlying instrument near the expiry date, while the CFD never expires and simply mirrors the underlying instrument.

Futures are often used by the CFD providers to hedge their own positions and many CFDs are written over futures as futures prices are easily obtainable. CFDs don&#x27;t have expiry dates so when a CFD is written over a futures contract the CFD contract has to deal with the futures contract expiration date. The industry practice is for the CFD provider to &#x27;roll&#x27; the CFD position to the next future period when the liquidity starts to dry in the last few days before expiry, thus creating a rolling CFD contract.

===Options===
Options, like futures, are established products that are exchange traded, centrally cleared and used by professionals. Options, like futures, can be used to hedge risk or to take on risk to speculate. CFDs are only comparable in the latter case. The main advantage of CFDs over options is the price simplicity and range of underlying instruments. An important disadvantage is that a CFD cannot be allowed to lapse, unlike an option. This means that the downside risk of a CFD is unlimited, whereas the most that can be lost on an option (by a buyer) is the price of the option itself. In addition, no margin calls are made on options if the market moves against the trader.

Compared to CFDs, option pricing is complex and has price decay when nearing expiry while CFDs prices simply mirror the underlying instrument. CFDs cannot be used to reduce risk in the way that options can.

===Covered warrants===
Similar to options, covered warrants have become popular in recent years as a way of speculating cheaply on market movements. CFDs costs tend to be lower for short periods and have a much wider range of underlying products. In markets such as Singapore, some brokers have been heavily promoting CFDs as alternatives to covered warrants, and may have been partially responsible for the decline in volume of covered warrant.

===Physical shares, commodities and foreign exchange===
This is the traditional way to trade financial markets, this requires a relationship with a broker in each country, require paying broker fees and commissions and dealing with settlement process for that product. With the advent of discount brokers, this has become easier and cheaper, but can still be challenging for retail traders particularly if trading in overseas markets. Without leverage this is capital intensive as all positions have to be fully funded. CFDs make it much easier to access global markets for much lower costs and much easier to move in and out of a position quickly. All forms of margin trading involve financing costs, in effect the cost of borrowing the money for the whole position.

===Margin lending===
Margin lending, also known as margin buying or leveraged equities, have all the same attributes as physical shares discussed earlier, but with the addition of leverage, which means like CFDs, futures, and options much less capital is required, but risks are increased. Since the advent of CFDs, many traders have moved from margin lending to CFD trading. The main benefits of CFD versus margin lending are that there are more underlying products, the margin rates are lower, and it is easy to go short. Even with the recent bans on short selling, CFD providers who have been able to hedge their book in other ways have allowed clients to continue to short sell those stocks.

==Criticism==
Some financial commentators and regulators have expressed concern about the way that CFDs are marketed at new and inexperienced traders by the CFD providers. In particular the way that the potential gains are advertised in a way that may not fully explain the risks involved. In anticipation and response to this concern most financial regulators that cover CFDs specify that risk warnings must be prominently displayed on all advertising, web sites and when new accounts are opened. For example, the UK FSA rules for CFD providers include that they must assess the suitability of CFDs for each new client based on their experience and must provide a risk warning document to all new clients, based on a general template devised by the FSA. The Australian financial regulator, the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, on its trader information site suggests that trading CFDs is riskier than gambling on horses or going to a casino. Even a small price change against one&#x27;s CFD position can have an impact on trading returns or losses. It recommends that trading CFDs should be carried out by individuals who have extensive experience of trading, in particular during volatile markets and can afford losses that any trading system cannot avoid.

There has also been concern that CFDs are little more than gambling implying that most traders lose money trading CFDs. It is impossible to confirm what the average returns are from trading as no reliable statistics are available and CFD providers do not publish such information, however prices of CFDs are based on publicly available underlying instruments and odds are not stacked against traders as the CFD is simply the difference in underlying price.

There has also been some concern that CFD trading lacks transparency as it happens primarily over-the-counter and that there is no standard contract. This has led some to suggest that CFD providers could exploit their clients. This topic appears regularly on trading forums, in particular when it comes to rules around executing stops, and liquidating positions in margin call. 
This is also something that the Australian Securities Exchange, promoting their Australian exchange traded CFD and some of the CFD providers, promoting direct market access products, have used to support their particular offering. They argue that their offering reduces this particular risk in some way. The counter argument is that there are many CFD providers and the industry is very competitive with over twenty CFD providers in the UK alone. If there were issues with one provider, clients could switch to another. Providers of contracts for difference (CFDs) often target potential investors through magazine advertisements, newspaper supplements, prime-time television spots and websites.

Some of the criticism surrounding CFD trading is connected with the CFD brokers&#x27; unwillingness to inform their users about the psychology involved in this kind of high-risk trading. Factors such as the fear of losing that translates into neutral and even losing positions become a reality when the users change from a demonstration account to the real one. This fact is not documented by the majority of CFD brokers.

Criticism has also been expressed about the way that some CFD providers hedge their own exposure and the conflict of interest that this could cause when they define the terms under which the CFD is traded. One article suggested that some CFD providers had been running positions against their clients based on client profiles, in the expectation that those clients would lose, and that this created a conflict of interest for the providers.

<doc id="1317336" wikidata="Q557397" url="?curid=1317336" title="Ankober">
<text>Ankober (), formerly known as Ankobar, is a town in central Ethiopia. Located in the North Shewa Zone of the Amhara Region, it&#x27;s perched on the eastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands at an elevation of about . It is to the east of Debre Birhan and about northeast of Addis Ababa.

Ankober was formerly the capital of the Ethiopian kingdom of Shewa founded by Yekuno Amlak in the thirteenth century. Buildings that survive from the Shewa period include the Kidus Mikael Church, built by Sahle Selassie. According to Philip Briggs, all that survives of Menelik&#x27;s palace, which he had built on the site of his father&#x27;s palace, is &quot;one long stone-and-mortar wall measuring some 1.5m high.&quot; Briggs comments that it is &quot;difficult to say why this one wall should have survived virtually intact when the rest of the palace crumbled into virtual oblivion.&quot; Ankober is also known as where the endemic Ankober serin was first observed by ornithologists in 1979.

== History ==
Ankober may have formerly been known as Gorobela.

Meridazmach Amha Iyasus, moved the capital of Shewa from Doqaqit to Ankober. It remained the principal residence of the rulers of Shewa until Negus (later Emperor) Menelik II moved it to Mount Entoto in 1878, although Wossen Seged preferred to live at Qundi during his reign. The name of the town is said to have been taken from an Oromo Queen, Anko, who ruled the town during the reign of Qedami Qal.

The first Europeans to record their visit to Ankober were the Evangelical missionaries Carl Wilhelm Isenberg and Johann Ludwig Krapf in 1839. However, at the time there was a small colony of Greeks, who made their living as craftsmen and tradesmen. In the following years, a steady stream of travellers visited Ankober, including Captain William Cornwallis Harris. Following the death of Meridazmach Sahle Selassie in 1847, the Abichu Oromo rebelled and attacked Ankober; only the firearms Sahle Selassie had collected there saved the capital. The Shewans burned the town in 1856 in reaction to the invasion, and eventual conquest, of Emperor Tewodros II.

It was soon rebuilt, and used by Tewodros&#x27;s appointees Haile Mikael and Seyfe Sahle Selassie as their seat of power. At that time, its population was around 5000, rising to 15,000 during the residency of the imperial court. The stone palace crowned the top of the hill, surrounded with a simple fortification of stakes and branches, while most of the people lived in conical thatched huts scattered across the face of the mountain. The Ankober market in the mid-19th century was held on Saturday, the day after the more important market at Aliyu Amba. The Ankober market was frequented mostly by the local Christians. During the later 19th century, Wehni Azaj Welde Sadeq (1838–1909) was governor of Ankober and chief of the local prison, having jurisdiction over the Afar lowlands until his death.

Around 1890, Menelek II began using Ankober to confine his political prisoners. People held there included Gaki Sherocho, the last king of Kaffa, and Ras Mengesha Yohannes, the rebellious son of Emperor Yohannes IV.

Around the time of the First World War, the population was around 2000. In the military actions leading to the Battle of Segale, on 18 October 1916 Negus Mikael&#x27;s troops crushed an advance force of 11,000 men stationed in Ankober and killed their leader, Ras Lul Seged.

During the Italian occupation, the town consisted of about 3,000 inhabitants living on two hilltops of different height. The Italian Resident lived on the higher hill, and on the lower hill were the two round churches Maryam and Medhane Alem. Around this time the Italians partly moved Ankober to a more accessible plateau. The Italians also carried out a number of bombings against the Arbegnoch in the neighboring area.

== Demographics ==
Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia published in 2005, Ankober has an estimated population of 1114 males and 1174 females for a total population of 2288. Despite its status as a former capital, Ankober is only the second-largest town in Ankober woreda.

==Transportation==
The 42-kilometer gravel road between Ankober and Debre Berhan was overhauled in May 2009.

<doc id="1317337" wikidata="Q4729632" url="?curid=1317337" title="All Songs Considered">
<text>All Songs Considered is a weekly online multimedia program started in January 2000 by NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; then-director Bob Boilen. At first, the show featured information and streaming audio about the songs used as bumper music on &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. The program has turned into a source of discovery for new music of all genres. In August 2005, the program began podcasting for free. In 2005, it began webcasting and podcasting live concerts from Washington, D.C.&#x27;s 9:30 Club, including acts such as Animal Collective, The Decemberists, Neko Case, and Tom Waits.

In its new format, Boilen and producer/co-host Robin Hilton wrote a blog where they introduced music from unsigned and unknown bands and solicit ideas for shows from listeners. There was an online music channel, &quot;All Songs 24/7&quot;, which used to stream music from the program&#x27;s archive, however this was discontinued in March 2019.

In 2007, &quot;All Songs Considered&quot; became the cornerstone program of NPR Music, the music discovery web site from National Public Radio. Some NPR stations also directly broadcast the program on terrestrial radio.

&quot;All Songs Considered&quot; is also the spiritual and physical home of Tiny Desk Concerts, as the concert series is recorded live at the former office desk of &quot;All Songs Considered&quot; host Bob Boilen at NPR&#x27;s headquarters in Washington D.C.

&quot;All Songs Considered&quot; was a nominee for the 2002 Webby Awards in the &quot;Websites and Mobile Sites&quot; category.

Hilton assumed regular hosting duties of the show after Boilen&#x27;s retirement in October 2023.

<doc id="1317350" wikidata="Q5154152" url="?curid=1317350" title="Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada">
<text>Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP; []) was a largely private-sector labour union with 150,000 members, active from 1992 to 2013. It was created in 1992 through the merger of three unions: the Canadian Paperworkers Union, the Communications and Electrical Workers of Canada, and the Energy and Chemical Workers Union. See below for some other unions that were merged into the CEP. CEP was affiliated to the Canadian Labour Congress.

The communications portion of CEP consisted of workers from telecommunications (principally Bell Canada), private TV stations, newspapers, commercial print and new media (such as Internet and web design). The large media component of communications (about 20,000 members) joined CEP in 1994 when members of the Canadian wing of NABET joined as well as newspaper members from the Canadian division of the Communications Workers of America (CWA). In 2005 nearly all Canadian members of the American-based Graphic Communications International Union (GCIU) representing newspaper press operators and commercial print workers joined CEP, though GCIU members in Quebec joined Teamsters Canada. These mergers have made CEP the largest media union in Canada. In 2007, Bell Canada clerical and sales employees that belonged to the Canadian Telecommunications Employees Association (CTEA) voted to merge with the CEP, uniting all Bell Canada unionized employees under one union.

The energy portion of CEP consisted mainly of Canadian workers in the oil, gas and chemical sectors, while the paperworkers portion of CEP consisted of pulp and paper workers in the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.

Membership is in flux as the pulp and paper industry in Canada declines and moves offshore. That industry has seen several plant closures affecting thousands of pulp and paper workers across Canada. A Canada Industrial Relations Board–imposed vote at the public broadcaster Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 2003 lost 1,800 technicians and camera operators from CEP to the CBC journalists&#x27; union Canadian Media Guild (affiliated with the CWA), whose members outnumbered the CEP members at the English-language section of CBC.

However, the 2005 GCIU merger as well as subsequent mergers with the Atlantic Telecommunications Workers Union and forestry workers in Quebec kept pace with membership declines in other areas.

CEP was an affiliate of the International Federation of Journalists.

The CEP voted in October 2012 to merge with the Canadian Auto Workers. The new merged union, Unifor, held its founding convention in 2013.

==Canadian Union of Operating Engineers==

The Canadian Union of Operating Engineers and General Workers was a trade union founded in June 1960 by stationary engineers and other steam plant workers in Ontario, and merged with CEP in 2003. The union separated from the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE). This separation set an example which led to the separation of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) from the parent United Auto Workers (UAW).

===History===
The founding members worked at The Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario at the R.L. Hearn Generating Station in Toronto and the J.C. Keith Generating Station in Windsor, Ontario. Other members included a steam plant in Ajax, Ontario and steam plants at Toronto area hospitals and the Toronto District Heating System (now Enwave).

After struggling to become an independent the small union faced a number of challenges. There were disputes with larger unions such as the IUOE, which continued to represent engineers at many workplaces in Ontario and Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). The CUOE was a founding member of the CCU, Confederation of Canadian Unions, started around 1968. The worst dispute occurred in 1972. The union continued to operate plants at Ontario Hydro during a strike involving the Power Workers Union (CUPE 1000). This dispute can be seen as management at Ontario Hydro using one union against another. After the strike any worker who left the CUOE to work at other Ontario Hydro plant lost his seniority. It was a long and bitter strike. Before the strike the CUOE was a strong union in Ontario Hydro power station operations, but the Power Workers Union (PWU) would emerge the ultimate winner, to represent workers in nuclear and other plants going forward. Some CUOE workers who crossed picket lines to operate stations such as, Lakeview Generating Station, and other locations received management jobs at Hydro Head Office and never returned to the CUOE. It has been called &quot;one of the most unfortunate chapters in Canadian labour history&quot; by labour leaders what happened in 1972, events both management and the union at Ontario Hydro (OPG) would prefer to forget. For the CUOE, it was the beginning of the decline of the Canada&#x27;s &quot;engineers union&quot;. The greatest setback for the CUOE was the closing of the R.L. Hearn and J.C. Keith stations by Ontario Hydro in the early 1980s.

Small groups of engineers employed mainly in district heating and at hospitals tried to maintain and regain membership for the next 20 years. The stationary engineers faced technological change and continued opposition from employers who feared a broader union of workers in this critical area. Larger unions in the public sector and industry often would base wage settlements and pay equity on the stationary engineer position in workplaces because if this group were to join a strike, it would be difficult to keep a facility in operation.

There was also attempts by many companies and professionals to eliminate stationary engineer positions using technology and equipment like coil tube boilers. Fewer young people entered the trade in recent years, and in Ontario (2007) there are fewer than 15,000 licensed engineers. The average age was 53 and colleges in Ontario are training less than 200 people per year.

One of the reasons for the current shortage of people in this field is the negative perception of skilled trades by young people and parents. With the introduction of new technologies such as computer controls, fuel cells, cogeneration and pollution controls, engineers will play an important role in the future and the trade is still a good career choice.

In September 2003 the CUOE merged with the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP) and became CEP Local 2003.

<text>David Shipman (1730 – 1813) is generally considered to be the real-life inspiration for James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s character Natty Bumppo in the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; along with a pioneer man named Thomas Leffingwell, a co-founder of Norwich, CT, whose son founded the Leffingwell Inn, now a museum. When Cooper&#x27;s father Judge William Cooper settled in what is now Otsego County, New York in the mid-1780s, Shipman lived alone in a small cabin in the hills south of the village of Cooperstown, a squatter on the land of Cooper&#x27;s neighbor John Christopher Hartwick.

Shipman was a veteran of the American Revolution and had a reputation locally as an expert hunter and fisherman. During the author&#x27;s youth, Shipman would often appear at the Cooper home, &quot;Otsego Hall&quot;, to offer the family some of his latest products. Susan Fenimore Cooper wrote that &quot;rude equipments, dogs, and rifle, had much attraction for the lads of the house&quot;. James Cooper referred to Shipman in his &quot;Chronicles of Cooperstown&quot; as &quot;the &#x27;Leather Stocking&#x27; of the region, ... could at almost any time, furnish the table with a saddle of venison&quot;.

<doc id="1317358" wikidata="Q6211229" url="?curid=1317358" title="Joe McEwing">
<text>Joseph Earl McEwing (born October 19, 1972) is an American professional baseball coach and former utility player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Kansas City Royals, and Houston Astros, and coached for the Chicago White Sox and Cardinals. Nicknamed &quot;Super Joe&quot;, he was the prototypical utility player who could play any position on the field.

==Early life==
McEwing graduated from Bishop Egan High School in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania in 1990. While in high school he played for both the basketball and baseball teams. He played college baseball at the County College of Morris in Randolph Township, New Jersey. During the 1991 season, he set a school record for single-season batting average, hitting .465. In 2001, the college retired his uniform number, six.

==Professional baseball career==
In 1998, he had a total of 51 doubles with Triple-A Memphis and Double-A Arkansas. His first full season in the majors was also his best. McEwing batted .275 in with 141 hits and a career-high nine home runs. He also amassed a 25-game hitting streak, the fifth longest at that time by a rookie, and finished fifth in National League Rookie of the Year balloting.

McEwing became an immediate fan favorite because of his energy, hustle, and obvious love for the game. His nickname, Super Joe, referred to McEwing&#x27;s positional versatility. During his rookie season, McEwing played every position on the field, except pitcher and catcher.

In his honor, St. Louis Cardinals fans created what was known as &quot;Little Mac Land,&quot; in a play on words of the official &quot;Big Mac Land&quot; created in the upper deck of Busch Stadium for Mark McGwire. McEwing had a streak of 230 errorless games, which at one point was the longest such streak by an active major league outfielder. McEwing was often successful against Randy Johnson, so McEwing was nicknamed &quot;Little Unit&quot; (a reference to Johnson who was called &quot;Big Unit&quot;).

During Spring training just before the start of the season, he was traded to the New York Mets for Jesse Orosco. Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa admired McEwing so much that he requested a pair of the player&#x27;s spikes upon the trade.

Released by the Mets toward the end of spring training in (which especially upset All-Star David Wright), the Kansas City Royals signed him to provide extra infield insurance. The Royals called McEwing up to the major leagues in April, when starting third baseman Mark Teahen went on the 15-day disabled list.

On March 30, , he was sent to the Houston Astros by the Royals. In , he signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. On January 16, , McEwing officially announced his retirement from baseball.

==Post-playing career==
===Chicago White Sox===

In the 2008 season, McEwing started his baseball coaching career as the hitting coach for the Charlotte Knights. On November 3, 2008, he was named manager of the Winston-Salem Dash, the Class A affiliate for the Chicago White Sox, for the season. During that season, Baseball America rated McEwing as the top managerial prospect in the South Atlantic League. McEwing was also named Manager of the Year for his work managing the Dash in 2009 and 2010.

McEwing was named manager of the Charlotte Knights, the White Sox Triple-A affiliate, for the 2011 season. In October 2011, McEwing was promoted to serve as the third base coach for the White Sox in 2012, serving under new manager Robin Ventura. Several managerial and coaching positions opened up shortly before the end of the 2011 season when then White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén announced that he would be leaving. McEwing was promoted from third base coach to bench coach for the 2017 season and continued to occupy that job until 2020 when the White Sox hired Miguel Cairo. On December 1, 2020, McEwing was named third base coach. 

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On January 12, 2023, McEwing was hired by the St. Louis Cardinals as their bench coach.

McEwing was ejected for the first time in his MLB career on May 5, 2023, arguing a called strike one to Dylan Carlson. Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol was ejected as well. On November 20, the Cardinals announced he will move into a role as a special assistant to John Mozeliak, the Cardinals president of baseball operations, as Daniel Descalso becomes the new bench coach.

==Personal life==
McEwing and his wife Courtnie reside outside of Philadelphia.

<doc id="1317363" wikidata="Q418418" url="?curid=1317363" title="Ankylosis">
<text>Ankylosis () is a stiffness of a joint due to abnormal adhesion and rigidity of the bones of the joint, which may be the result of injury or disease. The rigidity may be complete or partial and may be due to inflammation of the tendinous or muscular structures outside the joint or of the tissues of the joint itself.
When the structures outside the joint are affected, the term &quot;false ankylosis&quot; has been used in contradistinction to &quot;true ankylosis&quot;, in which the disease is within the joint. When inflammation has caused the joint-ends of the bones to be fused together, the ankylosis is termed &quot;osseous&quot; or complete and is an instance of synostosis. Excision of a completely ankylotic shoulder or elbow may restore free mobility and usefulness to the limb. &quot;Ankylosis&quot; is also used as an anatomical term, bones being said to ankylose (or anchylose) when, from being originally distinct, they coalesce, or become so joined that no motion can take place between them.

==Causes==

*Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis in which there is long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine.
*Other forms of arthritis may sometimes also lead to ankylosis, including rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis
*Osteoarthritis usually confers osteophyte formation, which may eventually fuse across joints. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low-grade inflammatory processes.
*Arthrodesis is the intentional creation of ankylosis in a joint.
*Noma—a gangrenous disease still widespread among malnourished children living on the borders of the Sahara desert—can cause ankylosis of the maxilla and mandible, impairing the ability to speak and eat.
*Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare bone disease in which muscle, tendons and ligaments turn to bone. This leads to progressive ankylosis of almost all joints.

==Society and culture==

===Fossil record===

Evidence for ankylosis found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Ankylosis has been reported in dinosaur fossils from several species, including &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, &quot;Becklespinax altispinax&quot;, &quot;Poekilopleuron bucklandii&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; (including the Stan specimen).

<doc id="1317364" wikidata="Q7143341" url="?curid=1317364" title="Pat Croce">
<text>Pasquale &quot;Pat&quot; Croce (born November 2, 1954) is an American entrepreneur, sports team executive and owner, author, and TV personality. He served as team president of the National Basketball Association (NBA)&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers from 1996 to 2001.

==Early life and education==
Croce is the son of an Italian American father and Irish American mother. He attended West Chester University and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in Health and Rehabilitation Sciences in 1977.

==Career==
He began his career as a physical therapist and was a physical conditioning and rehabilitation coach for the Philadelphia Flyers and an administrative director of the Sports Medicine Clinic of Haverford Community Hospital.

He is a black belt in taekwondo, and has commentated on Taekwondo during the 2016 Summer Olympics.

He founded Sports Physical Therapists in 1984 and grew the business into a chain of 40 centers spanning 11 states before selling it in 1993 for $40 million. Some of his clients included Mike Schmidt, Julius Erving and Charles Barkley.

===Philadelphia 76ers===
He was an athletic trainer for the Philadelphia 76ers for more than 10 years, originally hired to help thin 7&#x27;6&quot; center Shawn Bradley bulk up.

He became president and minority owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team in 1996 as part of a group led by Flyers founder Ed Snider and Comcast that bought the team. Under their ownership, the Sixers went from last place in 1996 to the NBA Finals in 2001. Croce has said of his ownership and management &quot;It was never about basketball. The real value proposition was changing the city from &#x27;can&#x27;t do&#x27; to &#x27;can do.&#x27;&quot; Croce was also known for greeting fans personally and getting a front-row seat at home games for low-level 76ers staffers (including maintenance men, ushers, and concessionaires). He appeared on the cover of &quot;Success&quot; magazine as the first trainer to rise to an ownership position with a professional sports team. He has also been featured in &quot;Inc.&quot;.

In June 2001, Croce refused to allow former President Bill Clinton into his private box during game 3 of the NBA Finals, as it would have inconvenienced friends, family, and dedicated Sixers fans.

He resigned as 76ers president after the 2001 season due to a dispute with Snider.

===After the 76ers===
Since leaving the 76ers, Croce was a television commentator on the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; and was a taekwondo commentator for the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2004, he hosted his own syndicated self-help television show, &quot;Pat Croce: Moving In&quot;, which premiered on September 13, 2004, and was canceled in 2005.

In January 2005, he opened the $10 million St. Augustine Pirate &amp; Treasure Museum in Key West, Florida. The museum features authentic pirate artifacts, many from Croce&#x27;s personal collection. In February 2006, he opened the pirate-themed Rum Barrel restaurant next to the museum. It was announced in February 2010 that the museum was being moved to St. Augustine, Florida. The museum opened on December 8, 2010.

Croce owns and operates, in conjunction with the University of Florida, the Colonial Quarter living-history museum in St. Augustine, Florida. It opened on March 16, 2013. As of January 2010, Croce serves on the board of directors for Movitas, a mobile technology company focused on the hospitality industry.
Croce was one of the four judges for the second season of ABC&#x27;s reality television series, &quot;American Inventor&quot;, which ran from June to August, 2007.

In October 2011, he financed and served on the monumental expedition that located the shipwrecks of Sir Francis Drake.

==Books==
His second book &quot;I Feel Great and You Will Too!&quot; was an autobiography that chronicled (among other things) his years at West Chester University and University of Pittsburgh, meeting his wife Diane Croce, starting his own business, purchasing the Sixers, and his 1999 motorcycle accident. The book is laced with career and personal advice Croce has gathered through his life. Following its release, the book made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Croce has written other self-help books: &quot;110%&quot; (2001); &quot;Lead Or Get Off The Pot&quot; (2004); &quot;Pat Croce&#x27;s Victory Journal&quot; (2002); and the &quot;Do It Now! Journal&quot; (2004)three of which topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list.

Croce is also the author of several books on pirates, including Pirate Soul (2006) and My Pop Pop Is A Pirate (2008). More recently, Croce has written and released an illustrated book, Blackbeard, and The Pirate Handbook (both released in 2011). He is working on a series of historic fiction books based on the lives of pirates such as Sir Francis Drake and Henry Morgan.

<doc id="1317376" wikidata="Q2604598" url="?curid=1317376" title="Complete Savages">
<text>Complete Savages is an American sitcom that was broadcast on ABC from September 24, 2004, to June 17, 2005. It was part of ABC&#x27;s first attempt to renew its TGIF block since the original came to an end in 2000. The show was created by Mike Scully and Julie Thacker and executive produced by Mel Gibson. It was cancelled after its first season due to low ratings.

==Synopsis==
Nick Savage is a single father struggling to raise his five unruly sons (Jack, Chris, Sam, Kyle, and T.J.) alone, following the abandonment of their mother 10 years previously. Nick works on call, day and night, as a firefighter with his brother, Jimmy. Nick&#x27;s boys constantly stir up trouble and create unpredictable circumstances for the entire family to somehow resolve.

==Production==
The show&#x27;s production was announced in a press release on November 5, 2003. The show was inspired by Mel Gibson&#x27;s experience as a father of six sons. The theme song was composed and performed by Joseph Interlande, and appears at the beginning of each episode as a jam session amongst the whole Savage family.

== Cast and characters ==

=== Main cast ===
* Keith Carradine as Nick Savage – the irritable patriarch of the Savage family. His wife left him ten years prior to the pilot episode. He is quick-tempered. Although some of his parenting style is regarded by his sons as unfair, he always shows that he has his sons&#x27; best interests at heart and is very concerned for their education and well being. However, his solution to most problems is to get angry, a solution which seems to have been picked up by his sons Chris and Kyle and occasionally Jack. He works as a firefighter along with his younger brother, Jimmy. Although uptight and ill-tempered he is shown to be a &quot;cool&quot; dad allowing some things slide with his sons for their happiness usually with girls.
* Shaun Sipos as Jack Savage – the eldest son. He is considered the &quot;cool&quot; brother and has many girlfriends. He is an aspiring musician who sings and plays the guitar. Jack often takes on the role of leader for the boys and always organizes, stages, and tries to hold the brother together, mainly against their father. Jack is often envied tremendously by Sam mainly due to the reason that Jack is more popular in school and has many girlfriends while Sam is nerdy and finds it hard to get girls. Although Jack tries to seem independent, he often shows a lot of caring for his brothers, especially T.J.
* Erik von Detten as Chris Savage – A varsity letterman who is considered a dumb jock, as he was failing five different school subjects. Chris seems to have a very strong conscience as opposed to Kyle. Chris often agrees with Jack due to Jack&#x27;s great persuasion skills, combined with the fact that Chris is easily swayed and not that bright in the head. He also shows violence as a way of solving his problems as he&#x27;s not good with words. He clearly shows his superiority over his younger brothers through his often used punishment &quot;You&#x27;re going in the pit&quot; inherited from his father.
* Andrew Eiden as Sam Savage – the middle son considered &quot;black sheep&quot; of the group, as he is responsible and does his school work. He is an honor student who enjoys studying and being with his girlfriend. He is known for getting A&#x27;s in school with the exception of P.E. Sam was always considered by the boys&#x27; father as the easiest one to break when the boys were staging a front. 
* Evan Ellingson as Kyle Savage – A rebellious teenager who is unruly and constantly causing chaos. He has little regard for the safety of himself or others. Unlike his brother Chris, Kyle shows a lack of a conscience. He rarely feels bad or guilty about anything he does. He frequently hangs around with his younger brother T.J., whom he often convinces to do stupid things. Despite his misbehavior, he appears to be more mischievous rather than malicious. He is reckless and proud.
* Jason Dolley as T.J. Savage – the youngest son who basically does everything Kyle tells him to do. He constantly shows his obsession of farts. T.J. is a typical little brother. He is considered cute but deceiving with a reckless side.
* Vincent Ventresca as Jimmy Savage – Nick&#x27;s brother who works as a firefighter along with Nick. His personality is quite the opposite of his brother&#x27;s, and more inline of Nick&#x27;s sons, and he seemed to lead a careless life. He is single and has no kids, yet, is shown to be the fun uncle.

=== Minor cast ===
* Autumn Reeser as Angela Anderson – Sam&#x27;s next door neighbor and girlfriend. She is very much like Sam, in that she was very studious. She did not show interest in him at first even though Sam is quickly smitten with her and works extremely hard to get her attention. Unlike Sam&#x27;s family, her family is high class and more suave.
* Kylie Sparks as Brenda – the neighborhood bully. She is in the glee club, and is not very liked by the Savage family, even Nick pranks her house on Halloween. She is big, brutal and impulsive; expressed interest in dating Sam in one episode. She is known to be rude and have a disgusting attitude.
* Mel Gibson as Officer Steve Cox – a cop in a series of cheesy safety videos. 
* Candace Kita as Misty – Officer Cox&#x27;s girlfriend in the series of safety videos, who usually dies from an accident involving the theme of the video at the end.
* Betty White as Mrs. Agnes Riley – the crotchety old neighbor who despises the boys and often takes their belongings from them when they go into her yard.
* Kelly as the Savages&#x27; nameless pet dog – he is not very fond of Sam but is practically part of the family; eating at the table and getting involved in all the mischief. He is well trained and probably more civil than the boys.
* Mrs. Savage – The unseen Matriarch of the family who Nick divorced after a string of incidents that ended with glass in his meatloaf. She is said to be insane by several members of the family, was mentioned to have wanted Nick dead, and Nick threatens the boys several times with calling her back when they misbehave.

<text>The Florida Suncoast (or Florida Sun Coast) is a local marketing name for the west-central peninsular Florida coastal area, also sometimes known as Florida&#x27;s Beach communities. The region contains nearly of Gulf of Mexico beaches and the warm, sunny winter climate attracts tourists from across the US, Canada, and Europe. The name comes from the coast receiving the most days of sunshine per year.
==Cities and counties==
The Suncoast region includes the western central Florida cities of St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Largo, Dunedin, Tarpon Springs, Tampa, Brandon, Ruskin, Sarasota and Bradenton, among others. Many of the beach communities on the Gulf of Mexico are individually-incorporated cities, such as St. Pete Beach, Treasure Island, Madeira Beach, and Indian Rocks Beach. An exception is Clearwater Beach, which is part of the city of Clearwater.

Visit Florida, the state&#x27;s official tourism marketing corporation, defines the Suncoast region as the 20 barrier islands in the Clearwater/St. Petersburg area of central west Florida.

<doc id="1317383" wikidata="Q270105" url="?curid=1317383" title="Argumentation theory">
<text>Argumentation theory is the interdisciplinary study of how conclusions can be supported or undermined by premises through logical reasoning. With historical origins in logic, dialectic, and rhetoric, argumentation theory includes the arts and sciences of civil debate, dialogue, conversation, and persuasion. It studies rules of inference, logic, and procedural rules in both artificial and real-world settings.

Argumentation includes various forms of dialogue such as deliberation and negotiation which are concerned with collaborative decision-making procedures. It also encompasses eristic dialog, the branch of social debate in which victory over an opponent is the primary goal, and didactic dialogue used for teaching. This discipline also studies the means by which people can express and rationally resolve or at least manage their disagreements.

Argumentation is a daily occurrence, such as in public debate, science, and law. For example in law, in courts by the judge, the parties and the prosecutor, in presenting and testing the validity of evidences. Also, argumentation scholars study the &quot;post hoc&quot; rationalizations by which organizational actors try to justify decisions they have made irrationally.

Argumentation is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as &quot;modes of discourse&quot;), along with exposition, description, and narration.

== Key components of argumentation ==
Some key components of argumentation are:
* Understanding and identifying arguments, either explicit or implied, and the goals of the participants in the different types of dialogue.
* Identifying the premises from which conclusions are derived.
* Establishing the &quot;burden of proof&quot; – determining who made the initial claim and is thus responsible for providing evidence why his/her position merits acceptance.
* For the one carrying the &quot;burden of proof&quot;, the advocate, to marshal evidence for his/her position in order to convince or force the opponent&#x27;s acceptance. The method by which this is accomplished is producing valid, sound, and arguments, devoid of weaknesses, and not easily attacked.
* In a debate, fulfillment of the burden of proof creates a burden of rejoinder. One must try to identify faulty reasoning in the opponent&#x27;s argument, to attack the reasons/premises of the argument, to provide counterexamples if possible, to identify any fallacies, and to show why a valid conclusion cannot be derived from the reasons provided for his/her argument.

For example, consider the following exchange, illustrating the No true Scotsman fallacy:

: Argument: &quot;No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.&quot;
: Reply: &quot;But my friend Angus, who is a Scotsman, likes sugar with his porridge.&quot;
: Rebuttal: &quot;Well perhaps, but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.&quot;

In this dialogue, the proposer first offers a premise, the premise is challenged by the interlocutor, and so the proposer offers a modification of the premise, which is designed only to evade the challenge provided.

== Internal structure of arguments ==

Typically an argument has an internal structure, comprising the following:
# a set of assumptions or premises,
# a method of reasoning or deduction, and
# a conclusion or point.

An argument has one or more premises and one conclusion.

Often classical logic is used as the method of reasoning so that the conclusion follows logically from the assumptions or support. One challenge is that if the set of assumptions is inconsistent then anything can follow logically from inconsistency. Therefore, it is common to insist that the set of assumptions be consistent. It is also good practice to require the set of assumptions to be the minimal set, with respect to set inclusion, necessary to infer the consequent. Such arguments are called MINCON arguments, short for minimal consistent. Such argumentation has been applied to the fields of law and medicine.

A non-classical approach to argumentation investigates abstract arguments, where &#x27;argument&#x27; is considered a primitive term, so no internal structure of arguments is taken into account.

==Types of dialogue==
In its most common form, argumentation involves an individual and an interlocutor or opponent engaged in dialogue, each contending differing positions and trying to persuade each other, but there are various types of dialogue:
* Persuasion dialogue aims to resolve conflicting points of view of different positions.
* Negotiation aims to resolve conflicts of interests by cooperation and dealmaking.
* Inquiry aims to resolve general ignorance by the growth of knowledge.
* Deliberation aims to resolve a need to take action by reaching a decision.
* Information seeking aims to reduce one party&#x27;s ignorance by requesting information from another party that is in a position to know something.
* Eristic aims to resolve a situation of antagonism through verbal fighting.

==Argumentation and the grounds of knowledge==
Argumentation theory had its origins in foundationalism, a theory of knowledge (epistemology) in the field of philosophy. It sought to find the grounds for claims in the forms (logic) and materials (factual laws) of a universal system of knowledge. The dialectical method was made famous by Plato and his use of Socrates critically questioning various characters and historical figures. But argument scholars gradually rejected Aristotle&#x27;s systematic philosophy and the idealism in Plato and Kant. They questioned and ultimately discarded the idea that argument premises take their soundness from formal philosophical systems. The field thus broadened.

One of the original contributors to this trend was the philosopher Chaïm Perelman, who together with Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca introduced the French term &quot;la nouvelle rhetorique&quot; in 1958 to describe an approach to argument which is not reduced to application of formal rules of inference. Perelman&#x27;s view of argumentation is much closer to a juridical one, in which rules for presenting evidence and rebuttals play an important role.

Karl R. Wallace&#x27;s seminal essay, &quot;The Substance of Rhetoric: Good Reasons&quot; in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Speech&quot; (1963) 44, led many scholars to study &quot;marketplace argumentation&quot; – the ordinary arguments of ordinary people. The seminal essay on marketplace argumentation is Ray Lynn Anderson&#x27;s and C. David Mortensen&#x27;s &quot;Logic and Marketplace Argumentation&quot; &quot;Quarterly Journal of Speech&quot; 53 (1967): 143–150. This line of thinking led to a natural alliance with late developments in the sociology of knowledge. Some scholars drew connections with recent developments in philosophy, namely the pragmatism of John Dewey and Richard Rorty. Rorty has called this shift in emphasis &quot;the linguistic turn&quot;.

In this new hybrid approach argumentation is used with or without empirical evidence to establish convincing conclusions about issues which are moral, scientific, epistemic, or of a nature in which science alone cannot answer. Out of pragmatism and many intellectual developments in the humanities and social sciences, &quot;non-philosophical&quot; argumentation theories grew which located the formal and material grounds of arguments in particular intellectual fields. These theories include informal logic, social epistemology, ethnomethodology, speech acts, the sociology of knowledge, the sociology of science, and social psychology. These new theories are not non-logical or anti-logical. They find logical coherence in most communities of discourse. These theories are thus often labeled &quot;sociological&quot; in that they focus on the social grounds of knowledge.

==Approaches to argumentation in communication and informal logic==
In general, the label &quot;argumentation&quot; is used by communication scholars such as (to name only a few) Wayne E. Brockriede, Douglas Ehninger, Joseph W. Wenzel, Richard Rieke, Gordon Mitchell, Carol Winkler, Eric Gander, Dennis S. Gouran, Daniel J. O&#x27;Keefe, Mark Aakhus, Bruce Gronbeck, James Klumpp, G. Thomas Goodnight, Robin Rowland, Dale Hample, C. Scott Jacobs, Sally Jackson, David Zarefsky, and Charles Arthur Willard, while the term &quot;informal logic&quot; is preferred by philosophers, stemming from University of Windsor philosophers Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair. Harald Wohlrapp developed a criterion for &quot;validness&quot; (Geltung, Gültigkeit) as &quot;freedom of objections&quot;.

Trudy Govier, Douglas N. Walton, Michael Gilbert, Harvey Seigal, Michael Scriven, and John Woods (to name only a few) are other prominent authors in this tradition. Over the past thirty years, however, scholars from several disciplines have co-mingled at international conferences such as that hosted by the University of Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and the International Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA). Other international conferences are the biannual conference held at Alta, Utah sponsored by the (US) National Communication Association and American Forensics Association and conferences sponsored by the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA).

Some scholars (such as Ralph H. Johnson) construe the term &quot;argument&quot; narrowly, as exclusively written discourse or even discourse in which all premises are explicit. Others (such as Michael Gilbert) construe the term &quot;argument&quot; broadly, to include spoken and even nonverbal discourse, for instance the degree to which a war memorial or propaganda poster can be said to argue or &quot;make arguments&quot;. The philosopher Stephen Toulmin has said that an argument is a claim on our attention and belief, a view that would seem to authorize treating, say, propaganda posters as arguments. The dispute between broad and narrow theorists is of long standing and is unlikely to be settled. The views of the majority of argumentation theorists and analysts fall somewhere between these two extremes.

== Kinds of argumentation ==

===Conversational argumentation===

The study of naturally occurring conversation arose from the field of sociolinguistics. It is usually called &quot;conversation analysis&quot; (CA). Inspired by ethnomethodology, it was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s principally by the sociologist Harvey Sacks and, among others, his close associates Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson. Sacks died early in his career, but his work was championed by others in his field, and CA has now become an established force in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, speech-communication and psychology. It is particularly influential in interactional sociolinguistics, discourse analysis and discursive psychology, as well as being a coherent discipline in its own right. Recently CA techniques of sequential analysis have been employed by phoneticians to explore the fine phonetic details of speech.

Empirical studies and theoretical formulations by Sally Jackson and Scott Jacobs, and several generations of their students, have described argumentation as a form of managing conversational disagreement within communication contexts and systems that naturally prefer agreement.

===Mathematical argumentation===
The basis of mathematical truth has been the subject of long debate. Frege in particular sought to demonstrate (see Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, 1884, and &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;, 1879) that arithmetical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms and therefore are, in the end, logical truths. The project was developed by Russell and Whitehead in their &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. If an argument can be cast in the form of sentences in symbolic logic, then it can be tested by the application of accepted proof procedures. This was carried out for arithmetic using Peano axioms, and the foundation most commonly used for most modern mathematics is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, with or without the Axiom of Choice. Be that as it may, an argument in mathematics, as in any other discipline, can be considered valid only if it can be shown that it cannot have true premises and a false conclusion.

===Scientific argumentation===
Perhaps the most radical statement of the social grounds of scientific knowledge appears in Alan G.Gross&#x27;s &quot;The Rhetoric of Science&quot; (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990). Gross holds that science is rhetorical &quot;without remainder&quot;, meaning that scientific knowledge itself cannot be seen as an idealized ground of knowledge. Scientific knowledge is produced rhetorically, meaning that it has special epistemic authority only insofar as its communal methods of verification are trustworthy. This thinking represents an almost complete rejection of the foundationalism on which argumentation was first based.

===Interpretive argumentation===
Interpretive argumentation is a dialogical process in which participants explore and/or resolve interpretations often of a text of any medium containing significant ambiguity in meaning.

Interpretive argumentation is pertinent to the humanities, hermeneutics, literary theory, linguistics, semantics, pragmatics, semiotics, analytic philosophy and aesthetics. Topics in conceptual interpretation include aesthetic, judicial, logical and religious interpretation. Topics in scientific interpretation include scientific modeling.

===Legal argumentation===
====By lawyers====
Legal arguments are spoken presentations to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer, or parties when representing themselves of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. A closing argument, or summation, is the concluding statement of each party&#x27;s counsel reiterating the important arguments for the trier of fact, often the jury, in a court case. A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence.

====By judges====

A judicial opinion or legal opinion is in certain jurisdictions a written explanation by a judge or group of judges that accompanies an order or ruling in a case, laying out the rationale (justification) and legal principles for the ruling. It cites the decision reached to the dispute. A judicial opinion usually includes the reasons behind the decision. Where there are three or more judges, it may take the form of a majority opinion, minority opinion or a concurring opinion.

===Political argumentation===
Political arguments are used by academics, media pundits, candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events. The rationality of the public is a major question in this line of research. Political scientist Samuel L. Popkin coined the expression &quot;low information voters&quot; to describe most voters who know very little about politics or the world in general.

In practice, a &quot;low information voter&quot; may not be aware of legislation that their representative has sponsored in Congress. A low-information voter may base their ballot box decision on a media sound-bite, or a flier received in the mail. It is possible for a media sound-bite or campaign flier to present a political position for the incumbent candidate that completely contradicts the legislative action taken in the Capitol on behalf of the constituents. It may only take a small percentage of the overall voting group who base their decision on the inaccurate information to form a voter bloc large enough to swing an overall election result. When this happens, the constituency at large may have been duped or fooled. Nevertheless, the election result is legal and confirmed. Savvy Political consultants will take advantage of low-information voters and sway their votes with disinformation and fake news because it can be easier and sufficiently effective. Fact checkers have come about in recent years to help counter the effects of such campaign tactics.

==Psychological aspects==
Psychology has long studied the non-logical aspects of argumentation. For example, studies have shown that simple repetition of an idea is often a more effective method of argumentation than appeals to reason. Propaganda often utilizes repetition. &quot;Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth&quot; is a law of propaganda often attributed to the Nazi politician Joseph Goebbels. Nazi rhetoric has been studied extensively as, inter alia, a repetition campaign.

Empirical studies of communicator credibility and attractiveness, sometimes labeled &quot;charisma,&quot; have also been tied closely to empirically-occurring arguments. Such studies bring argumentation within the ambit of persuasion theory and practice.

Some psychologists such as William J. McGuire believe that the syllogism is the basic unit of human reasoning. They have produced a large body of empirical work around McGuire&#x27;s famous title &quot;A Syllogistic Analysis of Cognitive Relationships&quot;. A central line of this way of thinking is that logic is contaminated by psychological variables such as &quot;wishful thinking&quot;, in which subjects confound the likelihood of predictions with the desirability of the predictions. People hear what they want to hear and see what they expect to see. If planners want something to happen they see it as likely to happen. If they hope something will not happen, they see it as unlikely to happen. Thus smokers think that they personally will avoid cancer, promiscuous people practice unsafe sex, and teenagers drive recklessly.

==Theories==

===Argument fields===
Stephen Toulmin and Charles Arthur Willard have championed the idea of argument fields, the former drawing upon Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s notion of language games, (Sprachspiel) the latter drawing from communication and argumentation theory, sociology, political science, and social epistemology. For Toulmin, the term &quot;field&quot; designates discourses within which arguments and factual claims are grounded. For Willard, the term &quot;field&quot; is interchangeable with &quot;community&quot;, &quot;audience&quot;, or &quot;readership&quot;. Similarly, G. Thomas Goodnight has studied &quot;spheres&quot; of argument and sparked a large literature created by younger scholars responding to or using his ideas. The general tenor of these field theories is that the premises of arguments take their meaning from social communities.

===Stephen E. Toulmin&#x27;s contributions===
One of the most influential theorists of argumentation was the philosopher and educator, Stephen Toulmin, who is known for creating the Toulmin model of argument. His book &quot;The Uses of Argument&quot; is regarded as a seminal contribution to argumentation theory. 

====Alternative to absolutism and relativism====

====Toulmin model of argument====

==== Evolution of knowledge ====

===Pragma-dialectics===
Scholars at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands have pioneered a rigorous modern version of dialectic under the name &quot;pragma-dialectics&quot;. The intuitive idea is to formulate clear-cut rules that, if followed, will yield reasonable discussion and sound conclusions. Frans H. van Eemeren, the late Rob Grootendorst, and many of their students and co-authors have produced a large body of work expounding this idea.

The dialectical conception of reasonableness is given by ten rules for critical discussion, all being instrumental for achieving a resolution of the difference of opinion (from Van Eemeren, Grootendorst, &amp; Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, p. 182–183). The theory postulates this as an ideal model, and not something one expects to find as an empirical fact. The model can however serve as an important heuristic and critical tool for testing how reality approximates this ideal and point to where discourse goes wrong, that is, when the rules are violated. Any such violation will constitute a fallacy. Albeit not primarily focused on fallacies, pragma-dialectics provides a systematic approach to deal with them in a coherent way.

Van Eemeren and Grootendorst identified four stages of argumentative dialogue. These stages can be regarded as an argument protocol. In a somewhat loose interpretation, the stages are as follows:

* Confrontation stage: Presentation of the difference of opinion, such as a debate question or a political disagreement.
* Opening stage: Agreement on material and procedural starting points, the mutually acceptable common ground of facts and beliefs, and the rules to be followed during the discussion (such as, how evidence is to be presented, and determination of closing conditions).
* Argumentation stage: Presentation of reasons for and against the standpoint(s) at issue, through application of logical and common-sense principles according to the agreed-upon rules
* Concluding stage: Determining whether the standpoint has withstood reasonable criticism, and accepting it is justified. This occurs when the termination conditions are met (Among these could be, for example, a time limitation or the determination of an arbiter.)

Van Eemeren and Grootendorst provide a detailed list of rules that must be applied at each stage of the protocol. Moreover, in the account of argumentation given by these authors, there are specified roles of protagonist and antagonist in the protocol which are determined by the conditions which set up the need for argument.

===Walton&#x27;s logical argumentation method===

Douglas N. Walton developed a distinctive philosophical theory of logical argumentation built around a set of practical methods to help a user identify, analyze and evaluate arguments in everyday conversational discourse and in more structured areas such as debate, law and scientific fields. There are four main components: argumentation schemes, dialogue structures, argument mapping tools, and formal argumentation systems. The method uses the notion of commitment in dialogue as the fundamental tool for the analysis and evaluation of argumentation rather than the notion of belief. Commitments are statements that the agent has expressed or formulated, and has pledged to carry out, or has publicly asserted. According to the commitment model, agents interact with each other in a dialogue in which each takes its turn to contribute speech acts. The dialogue framework uses critical questioning as a way of testing plausible explanations and finding weak points in an argument that raise doubt concerning the acceptability of the argument.

Walton&#x27;s logical argumentation model took a view of proof and justification different from analytic philosophy&#x27;s dominant epistemology, which was based on a justified true belief framework. In the logical argumentation approach, knowledge is seen as form of belief commitment firmly fixed by an argumentation procedure that tests the evidence on both sides, and uses standards of proof to determine whether a proposition qualifies as knowledge. In this evidence-based approach, knowledge must be seen as defeasible.

== Artificial intelligence ==

Efforts have been made within the field of artificial intelligence to perform and analyze argumentation with computers. Argumentation has been used to provide a proof-theoretic semantics for non-monotonic logic, starting with the influential work of Dung (1995). Computational argumentation systems have found particular application in domains where formal logic and classical decision theory are unable to capture the richness of reasoning, domains such as law and medicine. In &quot;Elements of Argumentation&quot;, Philippe Besnard and Anthony Hunter show how classical logic-based techniques can be used to capture key elements of practical argumentation.

Within computer science, the ArgMAS workshop series (Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems), the CMNA workshop series, and the COMMA Conference, are regular annual events attracting participants from every continent. The journal &quot;Argument &amp; Computation&quot; is dedicated to exploring the intersection between argumentation and computer science. ArgMining is a workshop series dedicated specifically to the related argument mining task.

Data from the collaborative structured online argumentation platform Kialo has been used to train and to evaluate natural language processing AI systems such as, most commonly, BERT and its variants. This includes argument extraction, conclusion generation, argument form quality assessment, machine argumentative debate generation or participation, surfacing most relevant previously overlooked viewpoints or arguments, argumentative writing support (including sentence attackability scores), automatic real-time evaluation of how truthful or convincing a sentence is (similar to fact-checking), language model fine tuning (including for chatbots), argument impact prediction, argument classification and polarity prediction.

<doc id="1317388" wikidata="Q42060" url="?curid=1317388" title="Gyeryong">
<text>Gyeryong (; ) is a city in southeastern South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. The incumbent mayor is Choi Hong-Mook. The city was created in 2003 after being split from Nonsan following prolonged regional agitation.

Located on the outskirts of Gyeryong is the large military complex Gyeryongdae (), the headquarters of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces branches. Due to the city&#x27;s proximity to Gyeryongdae, approximately half (47%) of its inhabitants are connected to the military as service personnel and their dependents or civilian employees. The city hosts major Korean and international military conferences. From 1989-93, the headquarters was relocated from several locations in Seoul to a more spacious and newly built integrated complex. The Army and Air Force headquarters were first moved there in 1989, followed by the Navy headquarters four years later.

Mount Gyeryong (), adjacent to the city, is considered to have the most qi (spiritual energy) of any mountain in the country and is also the heart of Gyeryongsan National Park. As of December 2020, the city&#x27;s population was 42,822.

==Modern history==
Gyeryong is one of the nation&#x27;s newest cities except for those near Seoul. Its establishment as a city came in 2003, when it was split from Nonsan.

According to data, Gyeryong and vicinity were called Yeonsan County in 1896. After Japanese colonization, it was incorporated to Nonsan and later chosen as a military site. In 1989, the country&#x27;s military headquarters Gyeryongdae was to Gyeryong. In 1991, the city was designated a special area by president. The National Assembly on June 30, 2003, passed a bill on Gyeryong&#x27;s establishment and Gyeryong was officially designated six months later.

Among older residents, the area of Gyeryong was known as Shindoan. Gyeryong is also considered a satellite city of Daejeon due to its geographical proximity.

==Economy==
Pelicana Chicken has its headquarters in the city.

Due to the proximity of Gyeryongdae, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces and Ministry of National Defense are major employers.

== Transportation ==

=== Train ===

The Honam Line goes through the Gyeryong station east to west. The KTX passes through 5 times a day, and many Saemaeul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho trains passes through the station.

=== Roads ===
The Honam Expressway Branch passes through the city, exiting through Gyeryong IC. National Route 1 and National Route 4 pass through the city center.

<doc id="1317389" wikidata="Q720871" url="?curid=1317389" title="Naughty Dog">
<text>Naughty Dog, LLC (formerly JAM Software, Inc.) is an American first-party video game developer based in Santa Monica, California. Founded by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin in 1984, the studio was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2001. Gavin and Rubin produced a sequence of progressively more successful games, including &quot;Rings of Power&quot; and &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot; in the early 1990s. The latter game prompted Universal Interactive Studios to sign the duo to a three-title contract and fund the expansion of the company.

After designer and producer Mark Cerny convinced Naughty Dog to create a character-based platform game that would use the 3D capabilities of the new systems, Naughty Dog created &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; for the PlayStation in 1996. Naughty Dog developed three &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; games over the next several years. After developing &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;, the company began working on &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; for the PlayStation 2.

In 2004, Rubin, who had become the company&#x27;s president, left the company to work on a new project, &quot;Iron and the Maiden&quot;. In addition to their inhouse game team, Naughty Dog is also home to the ICE Team, one of PlayStation Studios&#x27;s central technology groups. The company&#x27;s first PlayStation 3 game, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2007, followed by several sequels and spin-off titles. This lasted until Naughty Dog announced a new intellectual property for the PlayStation 3, &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, which was in development by a secondary team at the studio and released to critical acclaim in 2013 which spawned a franchise. &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2020 to similar acclaim. The studio is developing &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation 5.

==History==
===As an independent studio (1984–2001)===
Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin met as pre-teens in 1982 at a weekend Hebrew school in Virginia. After they discovered a mutual interest in computers and video games, they began regularly discussing programming, game development, and game piracy during class. Having experimented with Lisp and C++, Rubin and Gavin teamed up with a friend, Mike Goyet, and founded JAM Software in 1984. The acronym &quot;JAM&quot; stood for &quot;Jason, Andy and Mike&quot;; however, when Goyet became uninterested in the work and did not contribute to JAM&#x27;s operations, Rubin and Gavin bought back his share of the company (about ) within months and the acronym was redefined as &quot;Jason and Andy&#x27;s Magic&quot;. Rubin and Gavin chose to create software for the Apple II and decided to create a skiing game for their second title. During production of the game, Gavin accidentally copied bootleg games over the only copy of the skiing game they had. Rubin then created a new skiing game called &quot;Ski Crazed&quot; (originally titled &quot;Ski Stud&quot;) within the weekend. The game played slowly, but Gavin reprogrammed the game to play quicker. Later, the game was gathered and published by Baudville, who bought the game from Jam Software for $250. &quot;Ski Crazed&quot; sold more than 1,000 copies. Rubin and Gavin created an Apple IIGS graphic adventure game titled &quot;Dream Zone&quot;, which was released in 1988 and ported to the Atari ST, Amiga and PCs.

In 1989, Rubin and Gavin released a game titled &quot;Keef the Thief&quot;, which was published by Electronic Arts for the Apple IIGS, Amiga and PCs. To make a fresh start and to dissolve their relationship with Baudville, Rubin and Gavin renamed Jam Software as &quot;Naughty Dog&quot; on September 9, 1989. Naughty Dog also created and developed &quot;Rings of Power&quot;, which was published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Genesis in 1991. Rubin and Gavin were joined on the title by programmer Vijay Pande, who would later become better known for orchestrating the distributed computing disease researching project known as Folding@home at Stanford University.

In 1994, Rubin and Gavin produced the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer title &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot; and presented it to Mark Cerny of Universal Interactive Studios. Cerny was pleased with &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot; and signed Naughty Dog on to Universal Interactive Studios for three additional games. Rubin and Gavin devised a plan to create a three-dimensional action-platform game. Because the player would be forced to constantly look at the character&#x27;s rear, the game was jokingly codenamed &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ass Game&quot;.

Production of the game began in 1994, during which Naughty Dog expanded its number of employees and invented a development tool called Game Oriented Object Lisp, to create the characters and gameplay. Cartoonists Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson were recruited to create the characters of the game, which resulted in the titular character Crash Bandicoot. After 14 months of development, the game was shown to Sony Computer Entertainment, who then signed on to publish the game. &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; was shown to the public for the first time at E3 and went on to become one of the highest-selling titles for the PlayStation console, selling over 6.8 million copies. 
Naughty Dog continued to develop two more &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; games, with a spin-off &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; kart racing game.

===Under Sony ownership (2001–present)===
Sony bought Naughty Dog and made them a first-party studio in 2001. According to Gavin in 2025, the primary reason Naughty Dog sought a buyer was due to the skyrocketing costs of AAA video game development from their own pockets; their first games in the 1980s had had budgets of around $50,000, while &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; had risen to $1.5 million. Gavin said the acquisition by Sony gave them the stability they needed to continue development.

As Sony, Naughty Dog first developed the first game of the &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; series. The &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; games met similar success as the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; games. During the development of &quot;Jak 3&quot; and &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot; games, Rubin and Gavin slowly transitioned Evan Wells and Stephen White to become co-presidents of Naughty Dog by the time the founders left the studio. White was replaced by Christophe Balestra after a year.

In 2007, Naughty Dog began work on the &quot;Uncharted&quot; series, and made their first approach to realistic worlds and characters, in contrast to their &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; and &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; series, which featured fantastical worlds set in a fictional setting. The &quot;Uncharted&quot; franchise has been praised for its cinematic quality and technical proficiency, and has sold over 41 million copies worldwide as of December 2017.

During the 2011 Spike TV Video Game Awards, Naughty Dog unveiled a new intellectual property, &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, described as a &quot;post-apocalyptic third-person action-adventure game&quot;, following the plight of a teenage girl, Ellie, and her adult protector, Joel, in a post-apocalyptic United States overrun with humans infected with a disease reminiscent of the infection caused by &quot;Cordyceps unilateralis&quot;. &quot;The Last of Us&quot; received universal acclaim upon release. In 2012 and 2013, Naughty Dog teamed with Mass Media Inc. to release the &quot;Jak and Daxter Collection&quot;. It contains high-definition ports of the original PlayStation 2 trilogy and was released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita respectively. In May 2013, Naughty Dog confirmed it will keep its existing in-house engine used in &quot;Uncharted&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; for the PlayStation 4.

On November 23, 2013, Corrinne Yu, principal engine architect at Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Halo 4&quot; developer 343 Industries, announced that she had joined Naughty Dog. On December 7, 2013, during the first edition of Spike&#x27;s VGX award show, Naughty Dog won the Studio of the Year award for its work on &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. On March 4, 2014, &quot;Uncharted&quot; lead writer Amy Hennig left the studio, with &quot;Uncharted 3&quot; director Justin Richmond and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; lead artist Nate Wells leaving soon after. Later, it was revealed that &quot;The Last of Us&quot; would be released on the PlayStation 4 as a remastered version.

In March 2017, Balestra announced that he would retire his role as co-president on April 3, 2017, after working at the company for fifteen years. Evan Wells remains in his role as president. In September 2017, game director Bruce Straley announced his departure from Naughty Dog, stating that he &quot;found [his] energy focusing in other directions&quot; following a sabbatical. Creative director Neil Druckmann was promoted to vice president in March 2018.

In October 2017, former environment artist David Ballard claimed that he suffered a mental breakdown after experiencing sexual harassment by a senior team member while working at Naughty Dog in late 2015, stating that he informed PlayStation&#x27;s HR department and the following day was terminated from his position and offered $20,000 to remain silent regarding the allegations, which he declined. Naughty Dog responded to the allegations with a statement declaring that it had &quot;not found any evidence of having received allegations from Mr. Ballard that he was harassed in any way&quot;.

Neil Druckmann was promoted to co-president alongside Evan Wells on December 4, 2020; Alison Mori, formerly the director of operations, and Christian Gyrling, the former co-director of programming, were promoted to co-vice presidents in his place. On October 4, 2021, director of communications Arne Meyer announced that he had been promoted to co-vice president. In July 2022, Josh Scherr announced his departure from Naughty Dog after 21 years with the company. In July 2023, Wells announced he would retire from the studio by the year&#x27;s end. Simultaneously, Druckmann became head of creative, with Mori promoted to studio manager and head of operations, Meyer to head of culture and communications, and Gyrling to head of technology. The leadership team was expanded further, with Erick Pangilinan and Jeremy Yates becoming co-heads of the art departments, and Anthony Newman to head of production and design. Gyrling departed the company after 17 years in November 2023, replaced as head of technology by Travis McIntosh.

==Games developed==

As a subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment, Naughty Dog is best known for developing games for the PlayStation consoles, including the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series for the original PlayStation, &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; on PlayStation 2, and &quot;Uncharted&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Before this, they also developed games including &quot;Dream Zone&quot;, &quot;Keef the Thief&quot;, &quot;Rings of Power&quot; and &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot;.
==Development philosophy==
Naughty Dog is known for its unique way of handling game development, as the studio does not have a producer in either of their teams. The work culture at Naughty Dog is very different from many other studios; there is less middle-management; the studio&#x27;s lead effects artist, Keith Guerrette, said: &quot;It comes with a lot of pros and cons but I think it definitely is one of our biggest strengths. Looking around at the rest of the industry, and this is something that we do talk about quite a bit, the companies that are doing really innovative, cool things are all the ones that don&#x27;t have the management, like the business side, directly injected into the company. Sony&#x27;s put us in this fantastic situation where we don&#x27;t have any producers; we don&#x27;t have any interactions with Sony corporate at all on the development.&quot; Naughty Dog has complete freedom in basically every aspect of game design, and that also means that Sony Interactive Entertainment, the parent company, does not prevent the studio from any implementation of game elements.

===ICE Team===
Naughty Dog is home to the ICE Team, one of Sony&#x27;s World Wide Studios central technology groups. The term &quot;ICE&quot; originally stands for &quot;Initiative for a Common Engine&quot; which describes the original purpose of the studio.

<text>Belmont Cragin is one of 77 officially designated Chicago community areas located on the Northwest Side of the City of Chicago, Illinois. It is designated Community Area 19, and is located NW of the Loop. Surrounding community areas include: Portage Park, Hermosa, Austin, Montclare, Dunning.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The first business to open in Belmont Cragin was a saloon opened by George Merrill sometime after 1835, when he settled with his family at the intersection of Armitage and Grand Avenues. Operating the saloon out of his home, Merrill catered to truck farmers carrying produce over the plank road to the city. The corner, named Whiskey Point, prompted many colorful and romanticized legends but attracted few permanent residents.

In 1862, Michael Moran established a hotel at Whiskey Point, but the area remained rural until 20 years later, when Cragin Brothers &amp; Company moved their tin plate and sheet iron processing plant near Whiskey Point. The plant and warehouses covered , and the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad built a station at Leclaire Avenue to accommodate all the employees. The station closed in 2006, replaced by the Grand-Cicero station on Metra’s Milwaukee District/West Line. Cragin also purchased a rivet company and moved machinery and workers from Connecticut to the location. Job opportunities and rail service brought settlers and a housing boom to the town, now named Cragin. Within two years, Cragin&#x27;s population was 200, and the community boasted a general store, two schoolhouses, and a Congregational church. The area rests on prairie and a ridge that was formed by a glacier. It was settled by farmers before the population took off from residents leaving Chicago for better living conditions and new factories in the area. Belmont-Cragin was eventually annexed by the City of Chicago.

===Industrialization and development===
Railroads drew more factories and workers to the area, which was annexed into Chicago as part of Jefferson Township in 1889. The Belt Railway Company extended its service into the area in 1883, and plants developed in the new neighborhoods of Hanson Park and Galewood. In the same year, the Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company launched a branch for its wire products, and the Western Brick and Tile Company found Galewood&#x27;s superior clay soil conducive to business. By 1891, Westinghouse, Church, Kerr &amp; Company Iron Works, the Pitts Agricultural Works Warehouse, and the Rice and Bullen Malting Company brought more people into Cragin.

In 1922 W. F. Hall Printing Company erected a plant on adjacent to the Northwestern railroad line, which further spurred manufacturing development. Swedish, German, and Irish workers were among the earliest to move near these factories. By 1920, these jobs drew Poles and Italians as well, and the population of the area more than quadrupled in the next decade. By 1930 the population escalated to 60,221, one-third foreign-born. In the 1930s, the community area became known as Belmont Cragin. Other companies came to the area too including Zenith (TV and electronics), and Ecco (cooking ware). Builders inundated the area to fill the housing needs of area workers. Bungalows, Cape Cods, and two-flats offered a range of housing type choices. Especially popular was the subdivided residential neighborhood on the eastern border named Belmont Park.

===1940s through the present day===
During the postwar years, until the 1990s, mostly descendants of Europeans, mostly already assimilated second, third and fourth generation German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Polish, and Scandinavians had populated the area. The area was heavily dominated by both Catholic and Lutheran churches and schools.

In the 1920s a retail shopping district began to develop along Belmont Avenue, known as Belmont Central. It eventually drew in retailers that once included Goldblatt&#x27;s Department Store, Woolworth&#x27;s, Walgreens, Ben Franklin, SS Kresge&#x27;s — later becoming K-mart in the Brickyard mall, JC Penney — also moving to the Brickyard Mall, IHOP restaurant, and Will Rodgers movie theatre. Children&#x27;s playgrounds were built. Present-day Riis Park began life as a golf course, and later became a park designed by Jan Jenssen, famed national park designer. The Chicago Transit Authority in the 1940s extended its Belmont Street electric bus service beyond Central, transporting new patrons into the shopping district. Gas buses arrived in the 1970s.

==== Brickyard Shopping Center ====
In March 1977, the opening of the Brickyard Shopping Mall on the former site of the Carey Brickyard property at Narragansett and Diversey added new vitality to the community, drawing city and suburban shoppers away from Belmont Central shopping district, Six Corners, suburbs and downtown. A 1981 addition of a nearby parking garage continued to contribute to business prosperity but the area had seen its days since the opening of the Brickyard Mall. The original Brickyard Mall was an enclosed three-level building but was demolished in 2003 to pave way for big box stores including Target and Lowe&#x27;s, along with the strip mall making it more automobile friendly rather than pedestrian friendly. Jewel Osco was originally in the location of Target in the old mall floor plan that once included Montgomery Ward and JC Penney department stores and K-mart.

==== Other Businesses ====

Until the early 1980s, Central Soya and its silos were located south of Grand Ave on Laramie; In 1943, Revere Copper opened a war material plant where Grand Ave. meets Fullerton Ave. From 1953 to 1963, Western Electric assembled mobile radar units in this structure and erected a tall concrete test stand at the corner of Fullerton and Normandy. Glidden paint was located just south of the train station on the 1800 block of North LeClaire Ave until the early 1980s. Cragin Department Store, located on the 4900 block of West Armitage, was a family-owned clothing and shoe store until the 1980s. Hawthorn Melody Dairy was located at Grand and Laramie. Reda&#x27;s Liquors and Lizzi&#x27;s House of Pizza were also located in the area. Dominick&#x27;s grocery store was located on Central Ave. at Altgeld St. before the company was sold off and closed down. Tony&#x27;s grocery store now anchors this location.

Belmont Cragin&#x27;s overall population grew by more than 6 percent in the 1980s and 37 percent in the 1990s. The Hispanic population grew from 3,072 in 1980 to 16,846 in 1990. By the 2000 Census, the area was 65 percent Hispanic, joining the Polish immigrants and businesses who had come to the area earlier. A number of young middle-class professionals joined blue-collar laborers in the area. Residents formed an active coalition called the Northwest Neighborhood Federation to address increases in crime, gangs, and school overpopulation.

By 1995, Hall Printing and other plants had closed their doors. The area experienced a drop in manufacturing employment and a decline in retail activity during the 1980s. Concerns over unemployment and an increasing poverty level have led residents to organize a home reinvestment campaign and to study ways of reviving the commercial climate in the area.

<doc id="1317395" wikidata="Q1583172" url="?curid=1317395" title="Less than Perfect">
<text>Less than Perfect is an American television sitcom created by Terri Minsky and starring Sara Rue and Sherri Shepherd which originally aired on ABC from October 1, 2002, to June 6, 2006. It follows Claude (Rue), who works at a television network named GNB, as well as her friends and colleagues.

== Overview and premise ==
The show centers on Claude Casey (Sara Rue), a young woman who works at GNB, a television network. Though at first a temp who fills in on other assignments, Claude is hired in the pilot by anchor Will Butler (Eric Roberts) to be his assistant. Claude&#x27;s fellow co-assistants Lydia Weston (Andrea Parker) and Kipp Steadman (Zachary Levi) are unhappy at Claude&#x27;s arrival, and do everything they can to make her miserable. Luckily, Claude is able to navigate the workplace with the help of her best friends Ramona Platt (Sherri Shepherd) and Owen Kronsky (Andy Dick), who also work at the network in other departments. In season two, two new characters joined the series: Will Sasso as Claude&#x27;s neighbor and GNB cafeteria head Carl Monari; and Patrick Warburton as Jeb Denton, ladder-climbing news anchor and Lydia&#x27;s love interest. Sasso, who had recurred throughout the last half of the first season, was upgraded at the beginning of the season; Warburton began as a recurring character in the first half of the season, before being upgraded at midseason.

Much was made at the time of the show&#x27;s premiere about the central character of the show being a &quot;full figured&quot; woman, and that the title correlated to Claude being &quot;Less Than Perfect.&quot; Over the course of the series, Rue lost . She has since become a spokesperson for Jenny Craig and lost a total of . As the series progressed, Rue&#x27;s figure became less of a focus on the series.

== History ==
Though it was never a rating juggernaut, &quot;Less Than Perfect&quot; aired at a time when ABC was seeing a large ratings decline across the network. However, the series received steady, respectable ratings, especially for being in the last slot of ABC&#x27;s Tuesday night sitcom lineup. The overall ratings for season two, which creator Terri Minsky later departed, actually saw an increase from the ratings of season one. However, in its third season, ABC moved the series to its TGIF revival lineup on Friday nights. This led to a major decline in ratings, and put the show at risk for cancellation; VGuide.com featured the show on a list of &quot;Endangered Series.&quot; Due to the series being near the threshold for the number of episodes needed for syndication, and the series still earning respectable ratings in the coveted 18–49 demographic, ABC ordered a 13-episode fourth season to air as a mid-season replacement.

For the fourth season, the series underwent a retooling that saw the departure of cast member Eric Roberts. Despite the close renewal, the future of the series was not assured. In January 2006, Zachary Levi said that many of the cast members were ready to move on after filming the season. In March, Sara Rue was cast in a CBS sitcom pilot &quot;Play Nice&quot;, starring as a woman who runs a toy company with her brother (the pilot was ultimately not picked up). After almost a year off the air, the series returned on April 18, 2006, in its old Tuesday night timeslot.

After airing only three episodes of the fourth season, ABC cancelled &quot;Less Than Perfect.&quot; The series was one of several sitcoms cancelled by the network, as they discontinued both the Tuesday night and Friday night sitcom lineups. ABC initially planned to burn off the remaining nine episodes with fellow cancelled sitcom &quot;Rodney&quot;, which had taken over its time slot the season prior. ABC ultimately aired only two more episodes before pulling both series off the schedule.

The show joined Lifetime Television&#x27;s lineup on June 1, 2009 in syndication. The network aired all 81 episodes, including the seven unaired episodes from season four. However, Lifetime dropped the series in 2010. In April 2012, &quot;Less Than Perfect&quot; joined the lineup of new Canadian network, ABC Spark.

=== Opening credits and theme ===
From the beginning, &quot;Less Than Perfect&quot; had a simple opening sequence, credits which were played over the opening scene of each episode of season one. However, a new theme song and opening sequence were introduced at the beginning of season two. The intro was abandoned after the first seven episodes, reverting to the previous simple credits which lasted until the end of season three. Season four introduced a five-second opening, in which the title can be seen on post-it notes on an office desk, while a brief instrumental version of the theme tune is played.

== Cast and characters ==
=== Main ===

* Sara Rue as Claudia &quot;Claude&quot; Casey, the quirky, sweet lead character. From Pittsburgh, Claude works as the executive assistant for GNB anchorman Will Butler. Initially insecure due to the fish out of water template she personifies, Claude gains confidence in herself and her abilities as the series progresses.
* Sherri Shepherd as Ramona Platt, a sassy co-worker and friend of Claude and Owen. She is sometimes bossy and obnoxious, but is still a loyal and caring friend. She dislikes both Kipp and Lydia.
* Andrea Parker as Lydia Weston, one of Claude&#x27;s &quot;frenemies&quot;. She is shallow, snobby, and professionally ambitious, although without noticeable work skills. Lydia finds Claude to be a hick and a walking fashion faux pas. Eventually, Lydia begins a relationship with Jeb Denton, and marries him in the season three finale. In season four, she becomes the producer of Jeb&#x27;s news segment, and hires Claude as her assistant.
* Zachary Levi as Kipp Steadman, Claude&#x27;s other frenemy and Lydia&#x27;s best friend, eventually becomes Jeb Denton&#x27;s assistant. He is shown to be arrogant, shallow, and snobby, but is more intelligent, and occasionally shows flashes of far more humanity than Lydia (seen in episodes such as &quot;The Pimp Hat&quot; and &quot;Why Are You Hurting Claude?&quot;).
* Andy Dick as Owen Kronsky, a seriously offbeat, sensitive, and sometimes clumsy office supply manager with GNB.
* Eric Roberts as Will Butler (seasons 1–3), Claude&#x27;s charming, but vain boss, a well-known national news anchor. He is a womanizer with several ex-wives. Will unexpectedly (and offstage) quits the network at the start of season 4, forcing Claude to scramble for another position—working for Lydia.
* Will Sasso as Carl Monari (Seasons 2–4; recurring season 1), the cafeteria manager at GNB. He is a friend of Claude, Ramona, and Owen. He lives across the hall from Claude, and becomes her boyfriend in season four.
* Patrick Warburton as Jeb Denton (Seasons 2–4), Will Butler&#x27;s co-anchor, and Lydia&#x27;s boyfriend (later husband). Jeb is a mellow, funny, and ambitious news anchor, who is trying to climb the ladder at GNB. He is Kipp&#x27;s boss, but rarely refers to him by name, mostly as &quot;Secretary.&quot; His favorite food is Crab Cakes.

Lionsgate Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;Less Than Perfect&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on . An error occurred on the set, in which the episodes appear in production code order rather that order of airdate, causing a particular issue with the season finale, which appears second-to-last and would chronologically be out-of-order if the second season were to be released on DVD.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Early reviews for the show found the characterization generally stereotypical, but critics often praised the performance of Sara Rue. &quot;USA Today&quot; asserted that &quot;in just two episodes, the good guys/bad guys structure and the exaggerated characterizations already are showing signs of wear,&quot; although it called Rue a &quot;welcome addition&quot; to TV sitcoms. &quot;People&quot; magazine likewise criticized the stereotypical characters, but summarized the show as &quot;Hardly perfect but happily Rueful.&quot; However, by Season 3, &quot;USA Today&quot; said the show had &quot;hit its stride.&quot;

==History==
For historical reasons, this position has a different title in Swedish than the other state secretaries of the Swedish government; the other posts are termed &quot;statssekreterare&quot;.

Before 1945, in a situation where the political head of the ministry often changed rapidly, the Secretary General represented the continuous lines in Sweden&#x27;s foreign policy; and was considered a prestigious step in the diplomatic career.

From 1932, Sweden has experienced a great deal of stability on the post of foreign minister, and from 1945 and on the post as state secretary for foreign affairs has increasingly been politized and a subject of replacement in connection with shifts of foreign minister. The precise role of the state secretary for foreign affairs has changed from cabinet to cabinet, particularly due to different prime ministers&#x27; particular interest and involvement in the shaping of foreign policy.

<doc id="1317401" wikidata="Q36254" url="?curid=1317401" title="Slavomolisano dialect">
<text>Slavomolisano, also known as Molise Slavic or Molise Croatian (; ), is a variety of Shtokavian Croatian spoken by Italian Croats in three villages – Montemitro (), Acquaviva Collecroce () and San Felice del Molise () – in the province of Campobasso, in the Molise Region of southern Italy. There are fewer than 1,000 active speakers, and fewer than 2,000 passive speakers.

It has been preserved since a group of Croats emigrated from Dalmatia due to the advancing Ottoman Turks. The residents of these villages speak a Shtokavian Younger Ikavian dialect with a strong Southern Chakavian adstratum. The Molise Croats consider themselves to be Slavic Italians, with South Slavic heritage and who speak a Slavic language, rather than simply ethnic Slavs or Croats. Some speakers call themselves or and call their language simply (&quot;our language&quot;).

==History==
According to evidence Croats arrived in Molise in the early 16th century. The documents from the episcopal archive of Termoli indicate that Molise Croats arrived 1518 in &quot;Stifilić&quot; (San Felice). A stone inscription on the church in Palata, destroyed in 1930s, read &quot;Hoc Primum Dalmatiae Gentis Incoluere Castrum Ac Fundamentis Erexere Templum Anno 1531&quot; (Residents of Dalmatia first settled the town and founded the church in 1531). The absence of any Turkish word additionally proves this dating.

The language of Molise Croats is considered to be important because of its archaism, preserved old folk songs and tradition. The basic vocabulary was done by Milan Rešetar (in monography), Agostina Piccoli (along Antonio Sammartino, Snježana Marčec and Mira Menac-Mihalić) in &quot;Rječnik moliškohrvatskoga govora Mundimitra&quot; (&quot;Dizionario dell&#x27; idioma croato-molisano di Montemitro&quot;), and &quot;Dizionario croato molisano di Acquaviva Collecroce&quot;, the grammar &quot;Gramatika moliškohrvatskoga jezika &quot; (Grammatica della lingua croato-molisana), as well work &quot;Jezik i porijeklo stanovnika slavenskih naseobina u pokrajini Molise&quot; by Anita Sujoldžić, Božidar Finka, Petar Šimunović and Pavao Rudan.

The language of Molise Croats belongs to Younger Ikavian dialect of Western Shtokavian, with many features and lexemes of Southern Chakavian dialect. The lexicon comparison points to the similarity with language of Sumartin on Brač, Sućuraj on Hvar, and Račišće on Korčula, settlements founded almost in the same time as those in Molise, and together point to the similarity of several settlements in Southwestern Istria (see Southwestern Istrian dialect), formed by the population of Makarska hinterland and Western Herzegovina.

Giacomo Scotti noted that the ethnic identity and language was preserved in San Felice, Montemitro and Acquaviva Collecroce only thanks to the geographical and transport distance of the villages from the sea. Josip Smodlaka noted that during his visit in the early 20th century the residents of Palata still knew the Croatian for basic terms like home and field work, but if the conversation touched more complex concepts they had to use the Italian language.

The language is taught in primary schools and the signs in villages are bilingual. However, the sociolinguistic status of the language differs among the three villages where it is spoken: in San Felice del Molise, it is spoken only by old people, whereas in Acquaviva Collecroce it is also spoken by young adults and adolescents, and in Montemitro it is spoken even by children, generally alongside Italian.

== Features ==
* The analytic &quot;do&quot; + genitive replaces the synthetic independent genitive. In Italian it is &quot;del-&quot; + noun, since Italian has lost all its cases.
* &quot;od&quot; replaced by &quot;do&quot;.
* Disappearance of the neuter gender for nouns. Most neuter nouns have become masculine instead under the influence of Italian, and their unstressed final vowels have almost universally lowered to . In the Montemitro dialect, however, &quot;all&quot; neuter nouns have become masculine, and vowel lowering has not occurred.
* Some feminine -&quot;i&quot;- stem nouns have become masculine. Those that have not have instead gained a final -a and joined the -&quot;a&quot;- stem inflectional paradigm. Thus feminine &quot;kost&quot;, &quot;bone&quot;, has become masculine but retained its form, while feminine &quot;stvar&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;, has become &quot;stvarḁ&quot; but retained its gender.
* Simplification of declension classes. All feminine nouns have the same case inflection paradigm, and all masculine nouns have one of two case inflection paradigms (animate or inanimate).
* Only the nominative, dative, and accusative cases can be used in their bare forms (without prepositions), and even then only when expressing the syntactic roles of subject, direct object, or recipient.
* Loss of the locative case.
* Slavic verb aspect is preserved, except in the past tense imperfective verbs are attested only in the Slavic imperfect (&quot;bihu&quot;, they were), and perfective verbs only in the perfect (&quot;je izaša&quot;, he has come out). There is no colloquial imperfect in the modern West South Slavic languages. Italian has aspect in the past tense that works in a similar fashion (impf. &quot;portava&quot;, &quot;he was carrying&quot;, versus perf. &quot;ha portato&quot;, &quot;he has carried&quot;, and &quot;portò&quot;, &quot;he carried&quot;).
* Slavic conjunctions replaced by Italian or local ones: &quot;ke&quot;, &quot;what&quot; (Cr. &quot;što&quot;, also &quot;ke&quot; - Cr. &quot;da&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, It. &quot;che&quot;); &quot;e&quot;, &quot;oš&quot;, &quot;and&quot; (Cr &quot;i&quot;, It. &quot;e&quot;); &quot;ma&quot;, &quot;but&quot; (Cr. &quot;ali&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, It. &quot;ma&quot;); &quot;se&quot;, &quot;if&quot; (Cr. &quot;ako&quot;, It. &quot;se&quot;).
* An indefinite article is in regular use: &quot;na&quot;, often written &#x27;na, possibly derived from earlier &quot;jedna&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, via Italian &quot;una&quot;.
* Structural changes in genders. Notably, &quot;njevog&quot; does not agree with the possessor&#x27;s gender (Cr. &quot;njegov&quot; or &quot;njezin&quot;, his or her). Italian &quot;suo&quot; and its forms likewise does not, but with the object&#x27;s gender instead.
* As in Italian, the perfective enclitic auxiliary verb is tightly bound to the past participle and always stands before it: &quot;je izaša&quot;, &quot;is let loose&quot; (Cr. facul. &quot;je izašao&quot; or &quot;izašao je&quot;), Italian &quot;è rilasciato&quot;.
* Devoicing or loss of final short vowels, thus e.g. &quot;mlěko&quot; &gt; &quot;mblikḁ&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;, &quot;more&quot; &gt; &quot;mor&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;, &quot;nebo&quot; &gt; &quot;nebḁ&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;.

== Phonology ==

===Consonants===
The consonant system of Molise Slavic is as follows, with parenthesized consonants indicating sounds that appear only as allophones:

* Unlike the standard Croatian lects, there are no alveolo-palatal phonemes and (ć and đ), as they have largely merged with the palato-alveolar and (č and dž). However, in cases where standard Croatian reflects Proto-Slavic *jt, the corresponding phoneme in Molise Slavic is instead . In some cases standard corresponds to Molise , as in Chakavian.
* , , , , , and appear mostly in loanwords.
* The velar fricative is inserted by some speakers between vowels to eliminate hiatus; some speakers use in this role instead. Rarely, can appear as an intervocalic allophone of .
* is realized as before velar plosives.
* A prothetic is regularly inserted before initial .
* A adjacent to a vowel is realized as a . Etymologically, it derives from a next to an unvoiced plosive; thus standard Croatian (‘thing’) corresponds to Molise Slavic .
* Some speakers realize as , as , and as .
* After a short vowel, the following consonant may optionally be geminated.

===Vowels===
The vocalic system of Molise Slavic has seven distinct vowel qualities, as follows:
* Besides these vowels, there is also a syllabic that functions as a vowel. Some speakers insert an epenthetic before the instead of pronouncing the as syllabic.
* There are two tones, rising and falling. A falling tone can be found only on single stressed initial syllables. A rising tone spreads over two equally-stressed syllables (or one stressed followed by one more stressed), except in cases where the second syllable has been lost. If the second syllable is long, some speakers only stress the second syllable.
* An opposition exists between long and short vowels, but only in stressed position. Vowels with a falling tone are sometimes long, and the second vowel with a rising tone is always long unless it is word-final, in which case the first vowel with a rising tone is long instead if the second vowel is voiceless or lost. Vowel length is only distinctive with falling tone; with rising tone, it is entirely predictable.
* and are found almost exclusively in loanwords.
* appears as an allophone of unstressed , especially next to nasal consonants.
* In posttonic position, there is a tendency to lower vowels, so that both and merge with (though some conservative speakers do not have this merger). and are also often lowered to and , but remain distinct.
* Etymologically short vowels become voiceless in final position. Among younger speakers they are often dropped altogether. is almost universally dropped, (and and , which have largely merged with ) less commonly, and is retained by almost everyone in all positions.

== Samples ==

A text collected by Milan Rešetar in 1911 (here superscripts indicate voiceless vowels):

A section of The Little Prince, as translated into Molise Slavic by Walter Breu and Nicola Gliosca:

An anonymous poem (reprinted in &quot;Hrvatske Novine: Tajednik Gradišćanskih Hrvatov&quot;, winner of a competition in Molise):

: SIN MOJ
&lt;poem&gt;
 Mo prosič solite saki dan
 ma što činiš, ne govoreš maj
 je funia dan, je počela noča,
 maneštra se mrzli za te čeka.
 Letu vlase e tvoja mat
 gleda vane za te vit.
 Boli život za sta zgoro,
 ma samo mat te hoče dobro.
 Sin moj!
 Nimam već suze za još plaka
 nimam već riče za govorat.
 Srce se guli za te misli
 što ti prodava, oni ke sve te išće!
 Palako govoru, čelkadi saki dan,
 ke je dola droga na vi grad.
 Sin moj!
 Tvoje oč, bihu toko lipe,
 sada jesu mrtve,
 Boga ja molim, da ti živiš
 droga ja hočem da ti zabiš,
 doma te čekam, ke se vrniš,
 Solite ke mi prosiš,
 kupiš paradis, ma smrtu platiš.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>iFilm is a discontinued U.S.-based video-sharing website on which users could upload, share and view videos. It was founded by filmmaker Raphael Raphael in 1997. It was later acquired by iFilm.net, a popular online interactive film and media archive, originally specializing in independent films. Ifilm.net was founded in 1998 by new media entrepreneurs Roger Raderman, J. Patrick Forden, and Luke McDonough. Percepticon Corporation engineered and built the website and content publishing system. Greg Deocampo, the founding CTO, developed the core engineering team, encoding network, presentation engine, and ad serving network. Its URL is now owned by Defy Media.

==Company history==
iFilm was founded in 1997 by filmmaker Raphael Raphael as a thinktank for artists and technicians about future directions of film. Raphael sold the domain to Rodger Raderman, founder of iFilm.net. The original intent of iFilm was to make short, independent films available online. It rejected home movies and pornography, but was open to all other film types. By August 1999, the site had over 450 movies, offices in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and employed 40+ people. Also during the summer of 1999, film editor Andrew Hindes and former sales and marketing head of &quot;Variety (magazine)&quot; Coco Jones joined the iFilm team. &quot;If the consumer thinks about &#x27;films&#x27;, then we want them to come to iFilm as their first point of entry,&quot; said founder Rodger Raderman. &quot;We see ourselves as the portal – the first stop on the web for all things film-related.&quot;

iFilm had many high-profile investors, such as Axiom Ventures, Inc., Eastman Kodak, Liberty Digital, Rainbow Media (Now AMC Networks), Sony Pictures Entertainment, Vulcan Inc., and Yahoo!.

iFilm suffered serious losses in 2000 as a result of the dot-com bubble bust. It reorganized under CEO Kevin Wendel in 2001 and rebounded with a new focus on viral video. Prior to 2005, when YouTube was founded, iFilm was one of the primary destinations for viral videos on the internet.

===Acquisition===
On October 15, 2005, under CEO Blair Harrison iFilm was purchased by Viacom for $49 million, with the hopes of creating their own user-generated YouTube rival. Instead, in December 2006, iFilm was bundled with MTV Networks&#x27; entertainment group. iFilm had a brief life with MTV Networks. On January 13, 2006, a television series presented as a collaboration between iFilm and VH1 entitled &quot;Web Junk 20&quot; debuted on VH1. The show was marginally popular, airing for 3 seasons.

===Rebranding===
Erik Flannigan, MTV Networks&#x27; VP of digital media, suggested that the core audience of iFilm, who were primarily young males, aligned perfectly with Viacom&#x27;s Spike. During the first quarter of 2008, the two brands were merged. The iFilm brand was no more and re-branded and re-purposed as Spike.com. The content of Spike.com was set to be composed of Spike programming, Comedy Central clips, GameTrailers and MTV videos. When Defy Media bought the URL from Viacom in 2014, it changed it so it redirects to Defy property Screen Junkies.

==Investors==
iFilm had many high-profile investors, such as Axiom Ventures, Inc., Eastman Kodak, Liberty Digital, Rainbow Media (now AMC Networks), Sony Pictures Entertainment, Vulcan Inc., and Yahoo!.

==Content==
Triumph the Insult Comic Dog first became a &quot;viral video&quot; at iFilm.

<text>Poems and Problems () is a book by Vladimir Nabokov published in 1969. It consists of 39 poems originally written in Russian and translated by Nabokov, 14 poems written in English, and 18 chess problems.

One of the 39 poems originally written in Russian, &quot;Lilith,&quot; in 1928, can be looked at as a foreshadowing of his 1955 novel &quot;Lolita&quot;. However, in the author&#x27;s notes, Nabokov states that &quot;Intelligent readers will abstain from examining this impersonal fantasy for any links with my later fiction,&quot; and that the poem was written &quot;...to amuse a friend.&quot;

== Table of contents ==
* THIRTY-NINE RUSSIAN POEMS

* FOURTEEN ENGLISH POEMS
==Quote==
* &quot;Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterize all worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity.&quot;

<doc id="1317415" wikidata="Q240289" url="?curid=1317415" title="Symphony No. 5 (Schubert)">
<text>Franz Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in B major,  485, was written mainly in September 1816 and completed on 3 October 1816. It was finished six months after the completion of his previous symphony.

==Scoring==
The symphony is scored for one flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns in B and E, and stringsof all his symphonies, it is scored for the smallest orchestra. It is Schubert&#x27;s only symphony which does not include clarinets, trumpets or timpani: hence the work has come to be known occasionally as “the symphony without trumpets and drums.”

==Mozartian influence==
In character, the writing is often said to resemble Mozart; Schubert was infatuated with the composer at the time he composed it, writing in his diary on June 13 of the year of composition, &quot;O Mozart! Immortal Mozart! what countless impressions of a brighter, better life hast thou stamped upon our souls!&quot; This is reflected particularly in the lighter instrumentation, as noted above. Indeed, the instrumentation matches that of the first version (without clarinets) of Mozart&#x27;s 40th symphony. For another example, there is a strong similarity between the opening themes of the second movement of D. 485 and the last movement of Mozart&#x27;s Violin Sonata in F major, K. 377.

==Musical analysis==

There are four movements:

===I. Allegro===

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c {
 \tempo &quot;Allegro&quot;
 \tempo 2 = 90
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot;
 \key bes \major
 \time 2/2
 \tiny bes1\pp (| d,) | \normalsize r4 es8-.\pp f-. g-. f-. es-. d-. | c-. bes-. a-. g-. f-. es-. d-. c-. | bes&#x27;4. (d8) f4-. f-. | f2 r
&lt;/score&gt;

This is Schubert&#x27;s first symphony to not start with a slow introduction. What starts the movement is a four-bar structural upbeat similar to the one that begins the finale of his Fourth Symphony before the main theme starts on bar 5. The main theme is a simple rising arpeggio with a dotted rhythm that dominates all of the themes of the exposition. The first movement is a slightly unusual sonata form since the recapitulation begins, as in the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;sonata facile&quot; (and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout Quintet&quot;), in the subdominant, not in the main key of the piece as is more usual. Schubert had previously used this device in his Second Symphony.

===II. Andante con moto===

The slow movement opens with a theme in two repeated stanzas. Following that, there is a modulation to C that is very characteristic of Schubert, even at age 19. The return to the main theme is straightforward, passing through G minor on the way. There is a repetition of the distant modulation afterwards, though to G this time and with a more immediate return.

=== III. Menuetto. Allegro molto ===

The menuetto has the chromaticism, though not the polyphony, of the menuetto of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40. The progression used mid-way through the movement to modulate is borrowed almost directly from Mozart – using the same approach (a gradual layering of instruments) to a dominant seventh chord. The trio is quiet throughout, and only gradually accumulates instruments, beginning with only bassoon and strings, and with a subtle suggestion of a pastoral mood over held lower string notes.

===IV. Allegro vivace===

The finale, in sonata form, is the longest of the four movements.

<doc id="1317423" wikidata="Q20855" url="?curid=1317423" title="Voith Schneider Propeller">
<text>The Voith Schneider Propeller (VSP) is a specialized marine propulsion system (MPS) manufactured by the Voith Group based on a cyclorotor design. It is highly maneuverable, being able to change the direction of its thrust almost instantaneously. It is widely used on tugs and ferries.

==Operation==
From a circular plate, rotating around a vertical axis, a circular array of vertical blades (in the shape of hydrofoils) protrude out of the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis. The internal gear changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate, so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction.

Unlike the azimuth thruster (where a conventional propeller is rotated about the vertical axis to direct its thrust, allowing a vessel to steer without the use of a rudder), the Voith-Schneider drive merely requires changing the pattern of orientation of the vertical blades. In a marine situation, this provides for a drive which can be directed in any direction and thus does away with the need for a rudder. It is highly efficient and provides for an almost instantaneous change of direction. These drives are becoming increasingly common in work boats such as fireboats and tugboats where extreme maneuverability is needed.

Azimuth thrusters (and Kort nozzles) have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to cycloidal drives. The azimuth thruster is less efficient and slower to manoeuvre, but is likely to be cheaper in the short term. Life cycle costs favour the Voith solution, something reflected in the residual value of a Voith water tractor. A choice is made on the basis of perceived performance requirements. Instead of a Kort nozzle, VSPs are often fitted with a &quot;thrust plate&quot; or &quot;propeller guard&quot; which acts as a nozzle at low speed, protects the VSP against grounding and provides another blocking location during drydocking.

A low acoustic signature favours the device&#x27;s use in minesweepers by minimising cavitation (usually produced at the tips of axial propellers) as the rotor does not need to rotate as fast for a given thrust. The underwater sound signature of the MV &quot;North Sea Giant&quot; (IMO: 9524073, MMSI: 248039000) dynamic positioning vessel was measured by the International Centre for Island Technology (ICIT) whilst installing a foundation monopile for the Voith tidal energy device in the Fall of Warness, Orkney (Ref Beharie and Side, 2011).

VSPs are offered with an input power range of 160 kW to 3900 kW

==History==
The Voith Schneider propeller was originally a design for a hydro-electric turbine. Its Austrian inventor, Ernst Schneider, had a chance meeting on a train with a manager at Voith&#x27;s subsidiary St. Pölten works; this led to the turbine being investigated by Voith&#x27;s engineers, who discovered that although it was no more efficient than other water turbines, Schneider&#x27;s design worked well as a pump by reversing the flow through the device. By changing the orientation of the vertical blades, it could be made to function as a combined propeller and rudder.
In 1928 a prototype was installed in a 60-hp motor launch named &quot;Torqueo&quot; (Latin:&quot;I spin&quot;) and trials were carried out on Lake Constance. A number of German minesweepers (R boats) were fitted with VSPs; the first of these was the R8, built in 1929 by Lürssen. By 1931 VSPs were being fitted in new vessels on Lake Constance run by the German State Railways. The first such ship to use the Voith Schneider propeller was the excursion boat &quot;Kempten&quot;. Two German 1935-type M class minesweepers &quot;M-1&quot; and &quot;M-2&quot; were fitted with VSPs.

The first British ship to use Voith Schneider propellers was the double-ended Isle of Wight ferry &quot;MV Lymington&quot;, launched in 1938. Some 80 ships had been installed with VSPs by the end of the 1930s, including the uncompleted 1938 German aircraft carrier &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; (two auxiliary units in the bow), and the Japanese submarine cable laying ship &quot;Toyo-maru&quot; (also 1938).

The three vessels (&quot;John Burns&quot;, &quot;Ernest Bevin&quot;, and &quot;James Newman&quot;) which were in service for the Woolwich Ferry until 2018 featured Voith-Schneider propulsion systems. They were built in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company of Dundee and featured one VSP in the bow and a second in the stern for remarkable maneuverability. The Tay Ferries &quot;Scotscraig&quot; which were built by the Caledon in the 1950s also used VSPs.It was essentially a replacement copy of the earlier &quot;Abercraig&quot; ferry, which was built by Fleming and Ferguson Paisley yard for Dundee Harbour crossings and launched in 1938. The &quot;Abercraig&quot; also featured VSPs.

The US Navy built twelve VSP-equipped &quot;Osprey&quot;-class coastal minehunters in the 1990s. These vessels have been decommissioned, six were sold to foreign navies. and six were sold for &quot;dismantlement purposes only.&quot; The French Navy operates sixteen tugboats of the RPC12 type, that can provide a 12-tonne bollard pull thanks to two Voith Schneider propellers.

The same device, mounted on a horizontal rather than a vertical axis, has been used to provide lift and propulsion on a few experimental aeroplanes, known as &quot;cyclogyros&quot;. None of them were very successful. It has also more recently been proposed as an alternative to rotors for drone applications.

<doc id="1317435" wikidata="Q947463" url="?curid=1317435" title="Socket wrench">
<text>A socket wrench (or socket spanner) is a type of spanner (or wrench in North American English) that uses a closed &quot;socket&quot; format, rather than a typical open wrench/spanner to turn a fastener, typically in the form of a nut or bolt.

The most prevalent form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often informally called a ratchet. A ratchet incorporates a reversible ratcheting mechanism which allows the user to pivot the tool back and forth to turn its socket instead of removing and repositioning a wrench to do so.

Other common methods of driving sockets include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).

== Interchangeable sockets ==
The basic contemporary form of socket is hexagonal, referred to as &quot;6-point&quot; for the pointed intersections where its six solid sided facets meet. 

Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called &quot;Allen drivers&quot; (trademark) or the generic term &quot;male bit drivers&quot;.

The principal advantage of interchangeable sockets is that, instead of a separate wrench for each of the many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt types now have sockets of different types made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a &quot;socket set&quot; with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the &quot;set size&quot; is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in fractional inch and metric sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.

=== Square drive ===
The interchangeable sockets are attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include square drive sizes (dimensions up to 1 inches are standardized in ANSI B5.38-1958, a &quot;de facto&quot; international standard with no metric equivalents). -inch square drive is less popular, as are No. 4 and No. 5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107. This wide range of square drive sizes provides for a wide variety of socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with O-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets. The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.

==History==
Wrenches in the form of —that is, a female driver to envelop the male head of a fastener—have existed for centuries. Early examples include the keys used to wind clocks since the Middle Ages. The heads and sockets were typically square; hex heads eventually became more common starting in the 20th century. The ratcheting socket wrench, with interchangeable (indexable) sockets, was invented by an American, J.J. Richardson, of Woodstock, Vermont. The tool was patented () through the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 16, 1863. The first illustration of the tool appears on p. 248 of the April 16, 1864 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;. In current American English usage, the term &quot;socket wrench&quot; describes the wrench, not the socket. However, the term &quot;socket wrench&quot; is not used in British English.

Square heads and sockets were the easiest to make in the era when hand filing was the typical method of manufacture. With the proliferation of modern manufacturing methods it became just as easy to make hex heads and sockets as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet pawl to catch the next tooth.

The quick release feature common to ratchets was invented and patented in 1964 () by Peter M. Roberts.

==== Ratcheting ====

A number of other specialized ratchets—with hammer heads, multiple drive sizes, and other unusual features—are built by various manufacturers.

==== Non-ratcheting ====

=== Powered ===
There are also power tool versions of &quot;air&quot; (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches which are used for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called &quot;impact sockets&quot;) are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness so as not to shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.

==Socket types==
There are two main types of sockets: impact and hand. Sockets are 
referred by their number of “points” for the pointed intersections of their multi-faceted interior sides. Common designs include :
*6 point, hexagon, for hexagonal nuts. 
**Variants include designs with curved (splined) faces for off nut corner contact, to reduce chance of stripping
*12 point (24 facets) for use with hexagonal nuts
Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, valve adjustment screws and pipe plugs, the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines, more common to aircraft and aerospace applications.

When working with common 6-point hexagonal fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers double the number of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut, and so allows alignment every 30 degrees, rather than every 60 degrees of angle. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger hexagonal bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.

Some specialized sockets are made with a specialized &quot;6 flute&quot; etc. socket that attaches to damaged bolts of both metric and fractional inch sizes for removal. Some specialized sockets are made to fit specific specialized applications and are designed and sized for that specific application. Spark plug sockets, oxygen sensor sockets, ball joint sockets, axle nut sockets, etc. fit in this category.

A much rarer form of socket is the penta socket, or 5 point socket, used with things such as,
Telephone lines, waterworks, and certain vehicles. By far the most common use for them is with water meters, which have 5 sided bolts or nuts.

===Impact sockets and drivers===
Sockets for use with an impact wrench or impact driver are expected to receive higher torques, which is also percussive, and so need to be made of tougher materials. They are made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel, often using CrMo steel to replace the CrV steel used in non-impact sockets. Most impact sockets made for &quot;standard&quot; hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design.

Chrome plated sockets are not suitable as the impact wrench may break the chrome plating, which can form razor sharp flakes - consequently impact sockets use different coatings - often a black phosphate conversion coating, or black oxide.

===Standard-length and deep-length sockets===

Sockets are available in various depths or lengths, often divided by most manufacturers into two categories of &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; according to the ANSI or DIN standard they are made to and the tolerances allowed by those specifications for each length of socket. Because the standards allow for some flexibility in tolerances, it is common to see two manufacturers make deep sockets of the same size but with slightly different depths even though both meet the same specification. Standard length, otherwise known as &quot;shallow&quot; sockets, have a lower profile and allow a user to access nuts in narrow spaces. Deep sockets are useful for turning nuts onto bolts when the bolt extends upwards into the socket (as in the case of many bolted joints), a very typical example being exhaust clamp bolts on a car. Low-profile sockets, shorter even than standard sockets, are available for some applications, typically oil filter removal on engines with limited access.

Although most manufacturers offer only those sizes and depths described within the common ANSI or DIN specifications, some exceptions do exist. Specialty manufacturers such as IMPERIAL-Newton Corp offer an expanded range of &quot;extra deep&quot; sockets for special industrial applications; and popular brands like Snap-on or Mac Tools offer what are called &quot;semi-deep&quot; or &quot;mid-length&quot; sockets, which provide much of a deep socket&#x27;s depth, while fitting in tighter locations.

===Pass-through sockets and ratchets===
Some sockets are designed to have the same outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a &quot;special&quot; ratchet that fits on the outside of the socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for -inch, -inch and -inch sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable -inch and -inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs &quot;Max Axess&quot;, and also sells GearWrench&#x27;s &quot;Pass-Thru&quot; brands. Lowes calls their socket system &quot;Xtreme Access&quot;, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application, but will nearly always be significantly wider.

===Drivers===
Male bit drivers are sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;sockets&quot;, but are in fact the opposite of a socket - a socket is a female recess or opening which receives another object. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 through T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a &quot;socket spinner&quot; screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to many different types of sockets, bit drivers and extensions.

== Accessories ==
These are some of the common accessories that are used with -inch, -inch, -inch (and so on) socket wrenches:

*&quot;Extensions&quot;, sometimes called &quot;extender arms&quot;, attach to a socket on one end and a ratchet on the other end of the extension. These &quot;extend&quot; the length of the socket and allow access to nuts or bolts that are difficult to reach. Extensions are typically in length in roughly increments. They are sometimes attached together to get a needed length extension, and often have a knurled section for added grip.
*&quot;Wobble&quot; extensions have their socket attachment ends ground to allow the socket-extension interface to bend up to about 15 degrees. This additional flexibility often makes using a socket plus extension in a cramped location easier. A wobble extension added to the end of any extension will convert it to a slightly longer &quot;wobble&quot; extension.
*&quot;Extension Grip Collars&quot; are collars with indents that fit on the back of most extensions preventing it from easily rolling away and allow one to easily grip extension and finger tighten or loosen nuts and bolts by turning extension + socket with or without ratchet. 
*&quot;Ratchet spinners&quot; are short (about ) extensions that have a knurled attachments on them for easy hand tightening or loosening without the ratchet handle.
*&quot;Size adapters&quot; allow sockets of one drive size to be used with ratchets of another drive size. They consist of a male drive fitting of one size attached to a female drive fitting of another size. They are typically about long. For example, a -inch to -inch adapter allows sockets with -inch drive holes to attach to a -inch ratchet, and so on.
*&quot;Universal joints&quot; are two articulated socket joints (about long) combined at a right angle, that allow a bend in the turning axis of the wrench and socket. They are used with extensions and ratchets for turning a bolt or nut at a difficult to access location. Wobble extensions may be substituted for some universal joint applications and have the advantage of not wobbling so much.
*&quot;Crow&#x27;s foot adapters&quot;, sometimes called crowfoot adapters, feature an open end similar to a spanner along with a square hole for a ratchet or breaker bar. They are used to reach otherwise inaccessible fastenings or to hold a tensioning nut at a specific torque whilst allowing access to a locking nut that would be inaccessible with a standard socket.

<text>Apsines of Gadara (; fl. 3rd century AD) was a Greek rhetorician. He was a native of the Hellenised city of Gadara, whose ruins stand today at the border of Jordan with Syria and Israel. Apsines went on to study at Smyrna and taught at Athens, gaining such a reputation that he was raised to the consulship by the emperor Maximinus. He was a rival of Fronto of Emesa, and a friend of Philostratus, the author of the &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;, who praises his wonderful memory and accuracy.

Two rhetorical treatises by him are extant:
# His Τέχνη ῥητορική (&quot;Art of Rhetoric&quot;) is a greatly interpolated handbook of rhetoric, a considerable portion being taken from the &quot;Rhetoric&quot; of Longinus and other material from Hermogenes (the scholar Malcolm Heath posits this work was actually written by Aspasius of Tyre);
an English translation was first published in 1997. Malcolm Heath has argued (&quot;APJ&quot; 1998) that the work&#x27;s attribution to Apsines is incorrect.
# A smaller work, Περὶ ἐσχηματισμένων προβλημάτων (&quot;on Propositions maintained figuratively&quot;).

<doc id="1317476" wikidata="Q3041364" url="?curid=1317476" title="Dunning, Chicago">
<text>Dunning is one of 77 officially designated community areas of the city of Chicago, Illinois. Dunning also is a neighborhood located on the Northwest Side of the city.

The neighborhood is home to Wilbur Wright College, Mount Olive Cemetery, Zion Gardens Cemetery, and the Eli&#x27;s Cheesecake factory.

It is also the location of the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center, formerly known as Cook County Insane Asylum and commonly referred to, in its day, as simply &quot;Dunning.&quot;

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1851 this remote prairie location seemed ideal for Cook County&#x27;s plans to erect a poor farm, potter&#x27;s field and asylum for the insane. The county purchased from Peter Ludby 160 acres hemmed in by Irving Park Road and Narragansett, Montrose, and Oak Park Avenues. Both facilities were housed in a three-story building situated atop a ridge.

Residents of the poor farm lived with their families growing vegetables, washing their clothes, and attending school on the premises. After 1863 the institution also admitted tuberculosis patients. The county built a separate building for the insane asylum in 1870. The construction of two more buildings in the 1880s added enough space to accommodate the more than 1,000 patients.

Following the Civil War, Andrew Dunning purchased 120 acres just south of the county property to start a nursery and lay the groundwork for a village. He set aside 40 acres for the settlement, but proximity to the insane hospital kept settlers away.

Initially transportation links were poor. Although trains brought employees and commuters from the city, visitors had to walk two and a half miles from the depot to the county farm. After a single three-mile track was extended to the facilities in 1882, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway&#x27;s &quot;crazy train&quot; brought patients, supplies, and medicines. The county built a station, naming it for Dunning.

===Development===
In the 1880s and 1890s Dunning&#x27;s rolling landscape remained sparsely settled. The Scandinavian Lutheran Cemetery Association bought 65 acres south of Dunning&#x27;s property in 1886 which became Mount Olive Cemetery. Jewish families purchased 40 acres between the Scandinavian cemetery and Addison for burials.

Around the turn of the century Henry Kolze inherited a tavern and wooded acreage at Narragansett and Irving Park which he turned into a picnic grove, known as &quot;Kolze&#x27;s Grove&quot;, or &quot;Kolze&#x27;s Electric Park&quot;. The idyllic scenery enticed visitors, as did the tavern. With the advent of the Irving Park Boulevard street railway, clubs, churches, and companies held picnics in the grove. Based on records from the Chicago Department of Revenue, we know that in 1910 other similar venues such as &quot;Kosciuzko Grove&quot; were also in the Dunning area.

The infirmary, poorhouse, and asylum eventually became overcrowded. Minimal heat in winter, no hot water, and poor ventilation contributed to the deaths of many patients and inmates. In 1886 an official investigation found misconduct, gambling, patient abuse, and &quot;influence&quot; in the hiring of medical personnel. After 1910 the poor farm was moved to Oak Forest, and two years later the state bought the mental hospital and property for one dollar. Although it was called the Chicago State Hospital, many continued to refer to the institution simply as Dunning.

In 1989, during development near Irving Park Rd. and Narragansett Ave., human remains were discovered. Research led to the re-discovery of the Cook County Potter&#x27;s Field, which had been located near the poor house and insane asylum. Approximately 38,000 people were buried there between the 1850s and the 1920s. A small park called the Read Dunning Memorial Park was established in 2002 as a memorial for those buried in the area.

===Residential settlement===
Outside the state facility, the population had grown to only 1,305 by 1909. In 1916 the first housing boom occurred when Schorsch Brothers Real Estate bought a tract west of Austin and south of Irving Park. They called the area West Portage Park to remove the stigma of association with Dunning.

Following World War I the population rose to 4,019, with residents primarily of Swedish, German, and Polish descent. In 1934 Wright Junior College was built in the eastern portion. At its peak in 1970 population reached 43,856 but fell to 36,957 by 1990. The State Hospital property stood in shambles and in the 1970s nearly half the buildings were razed. In that year, the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center was established, incorporating the old hospitals.

===Present===
Dunning currently borders the villages of Harwood Heights, Norridge, River Grove, as well as Elmwood Park. Many of the neighborhood&#x27;s residents are city workers, including police officers and firefighters. The area is close to the Harlem Irving Plaza shopping center.

Dunning moved toward a revival of institutional, commercial, and residential growth in the 1980s and 1990s. The neighborhoods of Schorsch Village, Belmont Heights, Belmont Terrace, and Irving Woods became more desirable. On Narragansett, north of Irving Park, Ridgemoor Estates boasted luxury homes near a golf club. New modern facilities were present at Chicago-Read Mental Health Center. Wright Junior College expanded with futuristic-style buildings and a learning resource center at Narragansett and Montrose. By 2000 the population had grown again, to 42,164. One in 3 people in Dunning is of Polish descent — the highest rate of any ethnic group in any Chicago neighborhood, according to the 2010 U.S. Census 

==Politics==
Dunning has voted for the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Dunning cast 8,712 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 5,342 votes for Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, Dunning cast 8,415 votes for Barack Obama and cast 4,452 votes for Mitt Romney.

==Notable people==
* Andrzej Czuma, 21st Polish Minister of Justice and member of the Sejm from Warsaw I. He lived in Dunning while a political refugee from the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.
* Chester P. Majewski, member of the Illinois House of Representatives. He resided at 3906 North Oketo Avenue during his legislative tenure.
* Danny Seraphine, a founding member and former drummer for the band Chicago, is from Dunning.
