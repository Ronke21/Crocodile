<text>Steven Bruce Smith (born August 21, 1954) is an American drummer best known as a member of the rock band Journey across three stints: 1978 to 1985, 1995 to 1998 and 2015 to 2020. &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine readers have voted him the No. 1 All-Around Drummer five years in a row. In 2001, the publication named Smith one of the Top 25 Drummers of All Time, and in 2002 he was voted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Journey on April 7, 2017.

==Early life==
Smith received his first drum kit at age two and in 1963 he began taking formal lessons with local Boston area drum teacher Bill Flanagan, who played in big bands in the swing era. Smith got his first &quot;real&quot; drum set when he was 12 years old. On many nights, Steve could be heard practicing in a small shed in the back yard of his Harvard Street home. Smith performed in the usual school band program and garage bands while in his teens, including Clyde, a South Shore sensation, but also began to broaden his performing experience by playing in a professional concert band and the big band at local Bridgewater State College.

==Career==

He graduated from high school in 1972, and at 19 he joined the Lin Biviano Big Band, playing with them for two years. After high school, Smith attended the Berklee College of Music and studied with Alan Dawson. In the early 1990s, he studied with Freddie Gruber. He recorded and toured with jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty in 1977–78. He was the drummer on the Focus album &quot;Focus con Proby&quot; (1978) and played with Ronnie Montrose. From 1978 to 1985, he was the drummer for the rock band Journey. He left the band in 1985 but returned in 1995 for the band&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;. In the interim, he played with Journey offshoot The Storm. In 2015, he rejoined Journey again, but was terminated from the group (along with bassist Ross Valory) in March, 2020.

Since 1977, Smith has led his own jazz group, Vital Information. Drummer Neil Peart of Rush invited him in 1994 to perform on &quot;Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich&quot;, a tribute album to Buddy Rich, who inspired both drummers. Smith recorded the song &quot;Nutville&quot; and was invited for the sequel tribute album, &quot;Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich, Vol. 2&quot;, for which he recorded &quot;Moment&#x27;s Notice&quot;. He recorded two albums with Buddy&#x27;s Buddies, a quintet composed of musicians who played with Rich. In 2007, Smith and Buddy&#x27;s Buddies were renamed Steve Smith&#x27;s Jazz Legacy. The band pays tribute to many great jazz drummers in addition to Buddy Rich. In 1989, Smith headlined the Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert held in New York City, performing a duet with drummer Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith. Smith released two albums, &quot;Very Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Set One &amp; Set Two&quot;, for Tone Center, recorded at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s club in London.

In 2001 &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine named Smith one of the Top 25 Drummers of All Time. During the following year, he was voted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame. In 2003, his DVD &quot;Steve Smith Drumset Technique – History of the U.S. Beat&quot; was voted the No. 1 Educational DVD of the year.

He has worked as a session musician for Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli, Elisa, Vasco Rossi, Zucchero, Savage Garden, Bryan Adams, Zakir Hussain and Sandip Burman. Additionally, he has played with jazz musicians such as Steps Ahead, Wadada Leo Smith, Tom Coster, Ahmad Jamal, Dave Liebman, Larry Coryell, Victor Wooten, Mike Stern, Randy Brecker, Scott Henderson, Frank Gambale, Stuart Hamm, Dweezil Zappa, Anthony Jackson, Aydın Esen, Torsten de Winkel, George Brooks, Michael Zilber, Steve Marcus, Andy Fusco, Kai Eckhardt, Lee Musiker, Howard Levy, Oteil Burbridge, Jerry Goodman, Tony MacAlpine, Hiromi Uehara and Bill Evans.

<text>Jonathan Mark Foreman (born October 22, 1976) is an American musician who is the lead singer, guitarist, primary songwriter, and co-founder of the alternative rock band Switchfoot. As a solo act, Foreman has released 14 extended plays and two studio albums. 

== Personal life ==

Foreman was born in San Bernardino County, California, but his family moved to Massachusetts and Virginia Beach during his childhood. There he became fast friends with Todd Cooper, who encouraged him to learn guitar. Cooper was later a guitar tech for Switchfoot, although he left in 2005 to pursue his own musical career.

After several years, Foreman and his family moved back to Southern California, this time settling in Encinitas. He graduated from San Dieguito Academy in the North County Coastal area of San Diego, California. Foreman attended UC San Diego and later dropped out to follow his singing career.

Foreman married Emily Masen in 2002, and the couple had a daughter in 2012. The couple welcomed their second child, a son, in June 2018.

One of Foreman&#x27;s favorite pastimes is surfing, and when not on tour, he resides in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, a beach community in Encinitas.

Foreman is a committed nondenominational Christian; however, his goal with Switchfoot has always been to make music for all people. &quot;For us, these songs are for everyone. Calling us &#x27;Christian rock&#x27; tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re trying to do. Music has always opened my mind — and that&#x27;s what we want.&quot;

Foreman&#x27;s father, Mark, served as the senior pastor of North Coast Calvary Chapel in Carlsbad, California. His mother is Jan (née Carlton).

== Influences ==

Foreman cites Elliott Smith, U2, The Police, James Taylor, The Beatles, Radiohead, J.S. Bach, Ronny Jordan, Miles Davis, Keith Green, Nirvana, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and Led Zeppelin as some of his musical influences. In 2001, he was awarded the &quot;Les Paul Horizon Award&quot; for the most promising up-and-coming guitarist at the annual Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards in Los Angeles.

== Side projects ==
Foreman has made musical contributions away from Switchfoot, including writing with Molly Jenson. He appeared on the song &quot;Deathbed&quot; Relient K&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Five Score and Seven Years Ago.&quot; In September 2009, Jazz musician Karl Denson released the album &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; in which two songs were co-written by Foreman, and one song, &quot;Drums of War&quot;, was solely written by Foreman, which he also sang on. He wrote &quot;Running Away from Me&quot; for Meat Loaf&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&quot;. Foreman collaborated with Ryan O&#x27;Neal for the Sleeping at Last song &quot;Birthright&quot;. Foreman has also contributed to the books &quot;The Art of Being&quot; and &quot;New Way to be Human&quot;, the latter written by producer Charlie Peacock

=== Fiction Family ===

In 2006, Foreman and Nickel Creek member Sean Watkins started collaborating on a duo project originally called &quot;The Real SeanJon&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Fiction Family&quot;. Their self-titled debut, &quot;Fiction Family&quot;, was released on January 20, 2009.

&quot;The album was recorded and written in parts because Nickel Creek and Switchfoot are both hard working, touring acts, we were rarely home from tour at the same time,&quot; says Foreman. &quot;Consequently the tracks were passed back and forth between Sean and I. Whoever was home from tour would chip away at the songs with no real expectations at all, mainly just for ourselves and for the love of the song I suppose. We came up with a few cowboy rules for the project: No double tracking. No pussyfooting. No tuning of vocals.&quot;

In November 2012, the band released an extended play titled &quot;Holiday EP&quot;. Their second studio album, &quot;Fiction Family Reunion&quot;, was released on January 29, 2013.

=== Solo projects ===

Foreman has also worked on various solo projects, independently releasing four EPs, titled &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, and &quot;Summer&quot;, released by Credential Recordings and lowercase people records. In October 2008, Foreman released &quot;Limbs and Branches,&quot; a collection of songs from the EPs along with two new tracks. In April 2009, he was GMA Dove Award-nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year.

In 2015, Foreman released the EPs &quot;Sunlight&quot;, &quot;Shadows&quot;, &quot;Darkness&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot;, which contain 25 songs; one for each hour of the day with one extra. Each song was produced by a different producer, with Foreman sending in tracks recorded backstage while on tour. They were mixed by Future of Forestry&#x27;s Eric Owyoung.

Foreman&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Departures&quot; was released in February 2021. The album featured collaborations with Lauren Daigle &amp; Madison Cunningham.

== Songwriting style ==

Foreman&#x27;s songwriting tends to be very dynamic, and he often employs a wide range of different instrumentation, including, but not limited to: guitar, violin, cello, trumpet, mandolin, sitar, flute, saxophone, clarinet, synthesizer, piano, miscellaneous percussion, and harmonica. Foreman has always aimed to use interesting instrumentation when writing for Switchfoot, mostly on some of the band&#x27;s first albums such as &quot;The Legend of Chin&quot;, &quot;New Way to Be Human&quot;, and &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot;.

<text>The Jung-Kellogg Learning Center (JKL) is the library and learning commons of Missouri Baptist University in Creve Coeur, Missouri. It is a member of the Bridges cluster of the MOBIUS Consortium, a network of libraries in the state of Missouri.

This building was made possible by donations from Dr. J. Marshall Jung and Dr. Frank Kellogg. It is for these two longtime supporters of the university that the building is named.

Originally called the Jung-Kellog Library, it was renamed to the Jung-Kellogg Learning Center after undergoing a major renovation during the summer of 2019. The newly renovated learning center officially reopened on October 18, 2019. For the renovation, the library underwent a significant reduction in its physical collection

<doc id="1328307" wikidata="Q2485636" url="?curid=1328307" title="Sexagesima">
<text>Sexagesima , or, in full, Sexagesima Sunday, is the name for the second Sunday before Ash Wednesday in the pre-1970 Roman Rite liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church, and also in that of some Protestant denominations, particularly those with Lutheran and Anglican origins. Sexagesima falls within pre-Lent.

==Significance==
At Sexagesima, individuals are encouraged to evaluate their current spiritual state and prepare themselves to enter the season of Lent. Such preparations can include confession and such reflections as would be profitable and in keeping with the themes of Septuagesima.

==Etymology and timing==
The name &quot;Sexagesima&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;sexagesimus&quot;, meaning &quot;sixtieth&quot;, and appears to be a back-formation of Quinquagesima, the term formerly used to denote the last Sunday before Lent. The latter name alluding to the fact that there are fifty days between that Sunday and Easter, if one counts both days themselves in the total as was the usual custom of the Roman Empire. 

Through the same process, the Sunday before Sexagesima Sunday was formerly known as Septuagesima Sunday, and marked the start of the Pre-Lenten Season which eventually became the time for carnival celebrations throughout Europe. This custom was later exported to places settled or colonized by Europeans. 

While Quinquagesima (50th day) is mathematically correct, allowing for the inclusive counting, Sexagesima and Septuagesima are only approximations. The exact number of days are 57 and 64 respectively. The earliest Sexagesima can occur is January 25 and the latest is February 28, or February 29 in a leap year.

==Observation==
===Anglican Church===
The 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, used in some Anglican provinces, retains Sexagesima Sunday (along with Septuagesima and Quinquagesima), as do the 1928 American Book of Common Prayer and the 1962 Canadian Book of Common Prayer.

===Latin Catholic Church===

Following the Second Vatican Council, Sexagesima and the other pre-Lent Sundays were eliminated in the new Roman Catholic liturgical calendar. These reforms went into effect in 1970. Most provinces of the Anglican Communion later followed in abolishing Sexagesima and the other pre-Lent Sundays, though they are retained wherever the Prayer Book Calendar is followed. The earlier form of the Roman Rite, with its references to Quinquagesima, Sexagesima and Septuagesima, continues to be observed in some communities.

<text>Sir George Watt (24 April 1851 – 2 April 1930) was a Scottish physician and botanist who worked in India as &quot;Reporter&quot; on economic botany and during the course of his career in India he compiled a major multivolume work, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Dictionary of Economic Products of India&quot;, the last volume of which was published in 1893. An abridged edition of his work was also published as the single volume &quot;Commercial Products of India&quot; in 1908. He is honoured in the binomials of several plants named after him.

==Life and career==
Watt was born in Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the third son of John Watt. He was educated at Grammar School, King&#x27;s College and Marischal College, Aberdeen, and later attended both the University of Aberdeen and the University of Glasgow. He received the degrees of M.B. and C.M. in 1873. He enjoyed teaching and joined the University of Glasgow as a prodissector to the Professor of Anatomy. Around 1864, there was a famine in Orissa and the then Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, Sir George Campbell was firm that agricultural education was key to avoiding similar disasters and following the recommendations of Sir John Strachey&#x27;s Famine Commission, a need to carry out scientific study to improve the food supply in India was noted. In order to fulfil this requirement, and on the recommendation of J.D. Hooker, he was selected for the post Professor of Botany, at Presidency College, Calcutta University and joined there in 1873–74. He taught for ten years at a college in Hoogly and at the same time began to study the local botany and began to form a private herbarium. He followed a system of numbering specimens in the field with numbered tag labels detached from similarly numbered sheets in the field to avoid mistakes in labelling. In 1879 he travelled around northwest Punjab and he described several new plant species from the Chamba region. In 1881 he was posted as surgeon to the Burma-Manipur Delimitation Commission with special permission to conduct botanical studies during the expedition. On his return he was made in charge of the Calcutta International Exhibition for 1883–84. Watt organized a 1700-page catalogue for the economic section of the exhibition that was in charge of. Towards the end of the exhibition, the government suggested that the catalogue should be expanded. The expanded version was ready for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of London in 1886. This was later to become the first volume of his work and he was made a CIE for his work. On his return to India, he was put in charge of the Indian Museum and appointed Reporter on Economic Products under the Department of Revenue and Agriculture. Isaac Henry Burkill worked as an assistant reporter. He organized another exhibition for the Delhi Exhibition of Indian Art on 2 January 1902 and published &quot;Indian Art at Delhi&quot;. Watt edited the &quot;Agricultural Ledger&quot;, a government bulletin that collated notes on agricultural products and practices sent by officers posted across India. As an economic botanist, he also published books on cotton and cacao.

During the course of his career in India the positions he was appointed to included special duty in connection with Burma-Manipur Boundary Commission as Medical Officer, 1882; Scientific Assistant Secretary, Government of India, 1881; in charge of the India Section of the Calcutta International Exhibition, 1884; Commissioner, Colonial and Indian Exhibition, London, 1885–86; Reporter to Government of India on Economic Products, 1887–1903; Governor of Imperial Institute, 1892; Editor, The Agricultural Ledger, 1892–1903; President, Pharmacological Section of the Indian Medical Congress, 1894; in charge of Calcutta Industrial Museum, 1894–03; Honorary Secretary, Indigenous Drug Committee of India, 1901; Director, Indian Art Exhibition, Delhi, 1903.

Aside from work, Watt also took an interest in missionary work in India. In 1873 he married Jane, daughter of Robert Simmie, a customs officer at Lossiemouth. They had a son and two daughters.

==Retirement ==
He retired in 1906 and settled in Lockerbie, Scotland. For five years he lectured on Indian trees to forestry students at Edinburgh University. He also published a taxonomic work on the &quot;Primulas of India&quot;. In 1912 he made a trip to the island of São Tomé. In Lockerbie, he served as a County Councillor and as a Justice of Peace. He helped in developing the gardens of the Crichton Royal Institution at Dumfries. He died at his home in Lockerbie on 2 April 1930.

==Publications ==

Watt&#x27;s first work on the catalogue of the exhibits at the Calcutta International Exhibition was published in 1883 and consisted of four volumes with seven parts in them. The exhibits themselves had been organized by Trailokhya Nath Mukharji, a civil servant who later served as a curator of the economic section at the Indian Museum. He was assisted by botanists as well as Indian physicians with a knowledge of medicinal plants including Dr Moodeen Sheriff of Madras, Kanny Lall Dey of Calcutta and Dr Udoy Chand Dutt of Serampore.
* Volume I. which included:
** Part I. Gums and Resins. 
** Part II. Dyes, Tans, and Mordants. 
** Part III. Fibers and Fibre-yielding plants. 
** Part IV. Oils and Oil seeds, Perfumery, and Soaps. Index.
* Part V. Medicinal Products
* Part VI. Foods, Food-stuffs, and Fodders
* Part VII. Timbers
This was developed further into Watt&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Economic Products of India&quot; published from 1889 to 1893 and projected to be in six volumes but it grew larger and the additions were accommodated by breaking up the last volume into four parts. It is considered by many as the greatest compilation of the commercial plants (and natural products) of India. Although there were similar subsequent works like the &quot;Wealth of India&quot; series, Watt&#x27;s work continues to be a major source for research. Watt&#x27;s compilation included descriptions of other natural products such as silk, oysters and minerals. 
* Volume I. Abaca to Buxus (1889)
* Volume II. Cabbage to Cyperus (1890)
* Volume III. Dacrydium to Gordonia (1890)
* Volume IV. Gossypium to Linociera (1890)
* Volume V. Linum to Oyster (1891)
* Volume VI. Part 1. Pachyrhizus to Rye (1892)
* Volume VI. Part 2. Sabadilla to Silica (1893)
* Volume VI. Part 3. Silk to Tea (1893)
* Volume VI. Part 4. Tectona to Zygophillum and Index (1893)
Watt&#x27;s assistant I.H. Burkill, who moved to the Straits Settlement published &quot;A dictionary of the economic products of the Malay Peninsula&quot; in two volumes in 1935. It was broadly modelled on the lines of Watt&#x27;s work.

Watt made a study of tea cultivation in Assam and Kangra and published a report of the pests and diseases affecting it in 1898.

==Awards and honours==
Watt won the Daniel Hanbury Gold medal in 1901, and was knighted in the 1903 Durbar Honours. He was also an Officier d&#x27;Academe; Corresponding Member of the Royal Horticultural Society: Fellow of the Royal Society, Haarlem; and President of the Richmond Athenæum, 1907.

A rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron wattii&quot;) was named after him by Cowan and an iris (&quot;Iris wattii&quot;) was named after him by Joseph Dalton Hooker. &quot;Eranthemum wattii&quot; (originally &quot;Daedalacanthus wattii&quot;) was described and named after him by R. H. Beddome. Other plants named after him include &quot;Clematis wattii&quot; and &quot;Primula wattii&quot;.

<doc id="1328321" wikidata="Q41790" url="?curid=1328321" title="Chung-Ang University">
<text>Chung-Ang University (CAU; ) is one of the top leading private research universities in Seoul, South Korea. The university operates two campuses: main campus located in Dongjak District, Seoul, and an additional campus in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province. CAU consists of 16 undergraduate colleges and 16 graduate schools.

Starting as a church-run kindergarten in 1916, CAU transformed into a school for female kindergarten teachers in 1922 and was granted university status in 1953. The university held its centennial in 2018. It has 33,600 undergraduates, 5,200 graduates, 700 professors, and 500 more part-time teaching staff.
The symbol of Chung-Ang University is Blue Dragon. It represents the sacredness, authority, freedom, and the eternal prosperity of CAU.

==History==
===Establishment 1916–1932===
Chung-Ang University began with the establishment of Chung-Ang Kindergarten as an annex to the Chung-Ang Methodist Church located in Insa-dong, Jongno District, Seoul, in April 1918.

Chung-Ang Kindergarten originated as a branch of Jungdong Church in 1916 and separated in 1918.

In 1922, the Japanese enacted legislation against kindergartens to restrict expansion, however, other kindergartens including Susong, Kyungsung, and Taewha, and kindergartens in Gaesung and Pyongyang were founded by 1924.

===Adversity 1933–1945===
The social conventions in the 1920s made it difficult to recruit female students but a Teacher Training Program was established and kindergarten teachers were educated, which can be seen as a development in the modern history of teaching in Korea. Undeterred by the hostile conditions, graduates were posted to kindergartens in cities including Hamhung, Hweryung, Busan, Masan, Jeonju, Anak, Cheonan, Sariwon, and Miryang. Thus, the Chung-Ang Kindergarten Teacher Training Program took on the role of a Professional Educational Institution.

By 1922, the Chung-Ang Teacher Training Program, in partnership with the Community Education Movement of various Japanese-Resistance organizations, was promoted to a Kindergarten Teacher Training School. Although its legal status was registered as a miscellaneous school, its standing in social perception was considered equivalent to that of a professional school with a 3-year degree course.

The reformed Chung-Ang Teacher Training School continued to face obstacles in management. With ten students, the school was forced to relocate to a private residence in 1932 due to financial and personal circumstances of the management.

In 1933, Louise Yim (&quot;Im Young-Shin&quot;) took over the helm and was appointed as the principal at the age of 34. She was a graduate of Kijeon School for Women and was previously imprisoned for 6 months for leading the Samil Independence Movement at Jeonju. She later graduated from Kwangdoo High School in Japan and was further awarded her M.A in the United States. She infamously sent pictures of the Japanese massacring Koreans during the Gwandong earthquake to Dr. Syngman Rhee, who was operating the Korean Independence Movement in the US.

After nine years in U.S., she returned to Korea in January 1932 and was determined to devote herself to the nation, which was still under Japanese rule. As she toured the country for her first role as the director of the YWCA, she realized that she needed to start with education to save the people.

Her savings of 30,000 dollars earned from farming, truck driving, and vegetable wholesale operation in U.S. was used to purchase a site at Heukseok-dong on which to build a school and took leadership of Chung-Ang Teacher Training School. Through Yim, Chung-Ang began to envisage its development as the cradle of national education.

Despite its relocation to Heukseok-dong, Chung-Ang Teacher Training School lacked facilities. So Yim rented Pearson Bible School to hold classes. However, there was a limit to Yim&#x27;s personal finances and with the Japanese prohibiting contributions, the development of the School continued to face financial difficulties.

Believing that the only solution was to raise funds from U.S., Dr. Yim worked to promote donations in the U.S. As a result, she was able to return home having established the Pfeiffer Foundation in U.S. to financially support Chung-Ang Teacher Training School.

With this, the first stone building was erected on the grounds of Heukseok-dong in April 1937, to become Young-Shin Hall upon its completion in May 1938, which forms the heart of Chung-Ang today.

Students subsequently founded Chosun Kindergarten Education Society and took charge of the social education plan through concerts, plays, and literary activities.

In 1937, the Japanese waged war against China, and in 1941 attacked Pearl Harbor, signalling the start of the Pacific War with the U.S. declaring war against Japan. Chung-Ang Teacher Training School was heavily targeted as Yim was educated in the U.S. and a devout Christian.

The Communications Unit of the Japanese Army attempted to take possession of the school, but their efforts were blocked by the strong resistance of Yim. By the end of WW2, under pressure from the Japanese forces, the school was no longer able to admit new students, and the school was closed in 1944.

===Construction and development of a comprehensive university 1946–1955===
As Japan was defeated and Korea liberated, Dr. Yim reopened the doors to Chung-Ang Teacher Training School on 28 September 1945, and established the school motto, &quot;Live in Truth, Live for Justice&quot;.

On 1 October of the same year, Chung-Ang Teacher Training School was re-organised under the name of Chung-Ang Professional School for Women and followed by the Admissions Ceremony. The Foundation, Chung-Ang Culture Institute, was established in November 1946, and its legal registration was completed by the following year.

In April 1947, the school was again reorganised into Chung-Ang College for Women, and then to Chung-Ang College in May 1948, establishing itself as a co-educational institution.

Whilst Dr. Yim served as a national diplomat in the United Nations, obtaining their endorsement to build a new Korea, she also continued her efforts in developing the school and was appointed dean and chairman of the board.

Although the college celebrated its first conferment of a bachelor&#x27;s degree in May 1950, it was again indefinitely closed due to the outbreak of the June 25 Korean War. Students were re-admitted subsequent to the September 28 reclaim of the Country, but soon the school had to flee to Busan and set up a temporary office there in the event of January 4 Retreat of Korea&#x27;s allied forces.

Upon Dr. Yim&#x27;s return to the country in April 1951 after completing her diplomatic duties in U.S., the school started to give lectures in Song-do, Busan. Later, it installed branch campuses and lectures in Iri and Seoul.

Chung-Ang College continued to provide education during the war times. As a result, the second, third, and fourth bachelor&#x27;s degree Conferment were held during the war years in Busan, in 1951, 1952, and 1953.

The school continued to provide education during the evacuation to Busan and was recognised as a comprehensive university in February 1953. Thus, with nine departments under four component faculties including the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Science, College of Law, College of Business, and College of Pharmacy, and a Graduate School, Dr. Yim was appointed as chancellor of the university.

The teaching faculty returned from Busan to its original site in Heukseok-dong, Seoul, in August, following the declaration of ceasefire in the Korean War in July of the same year. However, lectures had to be taught in temporary buildings as the site was still occupied by the U.S. Army. The site was eventually recovered after one semester in April 1954, and the area reorganised for the development of the university.

The university continued to expand to the scale of 19 departments under four faculties, and a population of 2,850, between 1955 and 1959. To accommodate the increase in departments and students, a four-storey building, Pfeiffer Hall, was constructed across approximately 2,500 pyeong (1 pyeong =3.1m2) in 1956, and Chung-Ang Library constructed across approximately 3,800 pyeong in 1959.

Concurrently, International Culture Research Institute was established to enhance research activities.

Partnerships were forged with Young-Shin Junior High School, Young-Shin Girls&#x27; Junior High School, Nakyang Junior High School, Nakyang Technical High School.

===Preparation for takeoff 1956–1979===
1960 saw the 4.19 Revolution, where the CAU students educated under the motto of &quot;Truth and Justice&quot; protested against the March 1960 Rigged Elections. Furthermore, despite the many challenges faced with the control policy affecting student-intake for the alleged qualitative improvement of universities, which was introduced in the wake of the 5.16 Military Coup in 1961, CAU was able to appoint Dr. Sung-Hee Yim as its second chancellor on 2 October 1961. Later Yim was re-appointed as the third chancellor, she was able to continue ensuring the internal stability of the university.

In January 1965, the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Science was segregated into the College of Liberal Arts, College of Science &amp; Engineering and College of Education, whilst the College of Law, College of Business, and College of Pharmacy were combined to form six colleges. Furthermore, the partnered Middle School and High School were renamed in affiliation with the College of Education, and an affiliate Elementary School was newly established under the Foundation, allowing the delivery of a coherent educational philosophy from kindergarten to graduate school.

In February 1967, the Graduate School of Social Development was established to train specialists and promote industrial links. In 1968, the university was again reorganised into the eight component faculties, including College of Liberal Art, College of Science &amp; Engineering, College of Education, College of Law, College of Political Science &amp; Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Agriculture, and College of Pharmacy, for the systemization of education impacting the affiliate organisations.
The College of Medicine was installed in December 1971, and Sung Shim Hospital, based in Jung District, Seoul, was incorporated as an affiliate hospital.

July 1961 saw the construction of Jin Sun Hall across approximately 1,400 pyeong, and the University Theatre across 1,920 pyeong. In October of the same year, the Social Development Hall was constructed across 1,600 pyeong. The Archives were reorganised to mark the 50th anniversary in 1968. The Blue Dragon Monument was erected to safe-guard artefacts and documents for the next 100 years, and Seungdang Hall built. Bobst Hall, covering 3,200 pyeong, was built the following year, December 1969. The Sung Shim Hospital of 1,395 pyeong was affiliated.

By this time, the founder of CAU, Yim was over 70 years old and finding the workload physically gruelling. Thus, she charged Dr. Chull Soon Yim to succeed her as the fourth chancellor of CAU.

The College of Liberal Arts and College of Science &amp; Engineering were restructured into the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Science and College of Engineering in 1972. In the field of art, CAU merged with Seorabol Art College, which was operated by the Seorabol Art Institute, in June 1972, and further reorganised the establishment under the College of Arts in 1974. Two affiliate schools were constructed in 1978, and the Graduate School of International Management and Graduate School of Education installed in January 1979.

Jin Sun Hall was extended in October 1972 for construction of 3,100 pyeong of Seorabol Hall, and 2,400 pyeong devoted to the construction of Natural Hall as part of the College of Medicine in 1974. The Students&#x27; Union Building was constructed in December 1976 over 2,000 pyeong, and in June 1978, a new annex provided over 1,450 pyeong for the affiliate Sung Shim Hospital, based in Pil-dong, Jung District, Seoul.

In February 1977 Yim, the founder of CAU, died.

In March 1980, lecture halls, dormitories and a Students&#x27; Union were built across 2,417 pyeong, 1,706 pyeong, and 597 pyeong of land respectively in Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, to create the Anseong Campus.

===Adversity after expansion 1980–1986===
Following the end of his term as chancellor, Dr. Chull Soon Yim was succeeded by the professor of philosophy, Dr. Suk-Hee Lee, as the fifth chancellor in May 1980.

The Graduate School of Mass Communication was established in November 1980 to train professional journalists, and Heukseok-dong equipped with education facilities accordingly. In December, a 0.9-acre annex was built for the affiliate hospital to improve the education environment for the College of Medicine.

Improvements to facilities happened at the Seoul and the Anseong campuses.

In October 1981, faculties in Anseong were reorganised under the College of Foreign Languages, College of Social Science, and College of Home Economics. Seoul and Anseong sites were listed as the university&#x27;s primary and secondary campus, respectively. The Department of Music was segregated from the College of Arts and newly established as the College of Music in October 1981. The College of Agriculture was reorganised as the College of Industrial Science. The Graduate School of Construction Engineering was added to the roster of faculties in September 1983. After the establishment of the College of Construction Engineering in the secondary campus in Ansung in October 1984, the secondary campus had seven colleges.

In November 1982, the Professor Research Center was built over 636 pyeong, and 626 pyeong was spared for the College of Agriculture experiment area. In December, the building for the College of Arts was built over 4,874 pyeong. Continuing the investments, 1,192 pyeong for the Music College lecture area, 714 pyeong for the assembly area, and 423 pyeong for the swimming pool was established in August 1983. In September, the Gymnasium was finished over 655 pyeong. In December 1984, the 1,145 pyeong building was erected for the College of Music; finally, 5,068 pyeong was given for the third faculty residence. By the end, the campus had a modern look.

Dr. Byoung Jip Moon succeeded to Dr. Suk Hee Lee as the sixth president in March 1985. Moon began to reorganize the management operating system. The Office of Career Planning was established. The management of the Chung-Ang Cultural Institute and the Medical Center were modified. The departments of French Language &amp; Literature and Japanese Language &amp; Literature were reinstalled, and the Department of Industrial Information created. The construction of a Central Library in the second campus was promoted.

===Realization of vision 2008===
Dr. Bum Hoon Park was inaugurated as the 12th university president in February 2005. As his first assignment upon election, he oversaw the evaluation of the Korean Council for University Education, marketing of capital, BK21, establishment of the Professional Graduate School of Law, and other national enterprises.

Restructuring of the Education Science Technology Faculty, which had been the greatest pending issue, was so successful it was nominated a leading university and awarded grant maintenance (KRW 9,100,000,000) comparable to that of major competitor universities, in spite of its 1-year probationary period.

Following the restructuring of the undergraduate programmes, recruiting of new admissions, registration of current students, financial situation and overall management records of the three professional schools and 11 specialised schools, were analysed to identify the areas for improvement and enhance teaching quality. Thus, 32 out of 42 staff from the professional schools and specialized schools were reassigned to the general graduate school, and 10 positions reduced. The members reassigned to the general graduate school have been resourced to serve as the primary models in forming the Research Priority Group (Staff), for the construction of a research-centred regime.

DRAGON 2018 (2001–2004), which was the development plan devised under the 11th university president to carry the university towards the university target vision by the Centenary Anniversary, was re-branded as CAU2018+ (2005–2008). CAU2018+ lists the valuation index for various industries and the source of expected revenue in detail. To accomplish the goals, CAU2018+ was implemented in two stages.

For the first four years of Dr. Bum Hoon Park&#x27;s term in office, resources were heavily invested in education/research equipment. Thus, the nation&#x27;s largest Law Hall was constructed in February 2007, and a master plan drawn up for the construction of the Pharmacy and Natural Science R&amp;D Centers around the Main Entrance in Campus 1, and an Engineering R&amp;D Center by the Gymnasium,

In 2008, the Media Practice Section was established in the Law Hall and 400 additional wards were added in the affiliate hospital. Accordingly, the Chung-Ang Site Construction Plan, included in the CAU2018+ Development Plan was set in motion.

In November 2007, authorisation was obtained from Hanam-si, for developing a tertiary, Hanam Campus. Camp Colbern, which was previously a US Army installation of 86,000 pyeong will be renovated for the purpose. A team will be banded per subject field to oversee the management.

244 full-time teaching staff were recruited between 2005 and 2009, and in the first semester of 2009, 25 full-time and part-time staff were recruited.

Law and Medical Schools were established in March 2009.

KRW 40 billion of development funds, KRW 166.3 billion of external research grant, and KRW 17.3 billion in government aid allocated as a government-funded enterprise have been secured over the 4 years since Dr. Bum Hoon Park&#x27;s inauguration into office. The sum of KRW 223.6 billion is the largest amount secured financially in the history of the university.

In May 2008, a global corporation, Doosan Group, was incorporated as an educational institution, and Yong-Sung Park was elected as the ninth chairman of the board.

The appointment of Chairman Park, who negotiated the industry-shift of Doosan Group from consumer goods to heavy industry, symbolises the rebirth of the university. Within 80 days of taking office, a meeting was held with the teaching staff on 27 August 2008, where the CAU2018+ Mid-Term Development Plans were announced along with the new strategy direction of &quot;Choice and Concentrate, Strengthening of Executive Ability, Establishment of Virtuous Cycle Structure&quot;.

The Degree Management System has been strengthened to encourage students to study diligently, as in order to graduate, students have been made to attain a minimum level in compulsory subjects such as English and Accounting.

In order to the support this type of research, education and practice more effectively, an R&amp;D Center for the College of Pharmacy and new Dormitories for students were constructed, the Central Library renovated, and the hospital extended to fit 300 additional wards.

Research projects are also being supported by the Special Committee for Strengthening the Research Marketability.

Such changes have already resulted in the designation of six new companies in the second stages of the BK21 enterprise, and a budget of KRW 6 billion being allocated to the leading research team, thus implementing the &quot;choice and concentrate&quot; strategy.

The direct election system for presidency was abolished and replaced by the appointment system. Consequently, the 12th president, Dr. Bum Hee Park, was re-appointed into office as the consecutive 13th president.

The largest project being persevered by Dr. Bum Hee Park and the corporation, is the establishment of Hanam Campus. In 2007, a memorandum of understanding was exchanged with Hanam-si.

As of February 2009, Chung-Ang University, as a comprehensive institution, has produced one general graduate school, five professional graduate schools, 11 specialised graduate schools, 18 modularised colleges in the campuses across Seoul and Anseong, and issued a total of 147,196 Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 29,940 Master&#x27;s degrees, and 4,275 Doctorates.

In March 2014 Chung-Ang University began accepting video game players into their Department of Sport Science.

<doc id="1328333" wikidata="Q4819123" url="?curid=1328333" title="Tom Ammiano">
<text>Tom Ammiano (born December 15, 1941) is an American politician and LGBT rights activist from San Francisco, California. Ammiano, a member of the California Legislative LGBT Caucus, served as a member of the California State Assembly from 2008 to November 30, 2014. He had previously been a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and had mounted an unsuccessful bid for mayor of San Francisco in 1999. He was succeeded as California&#x27;s Assemblyman for District 17 by San Francisco Board of Supervisors President David Chiu on December 1, 2014.

==Early life and education==
Ammiano grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, part of a working-class family of Italian Americans. He attended Immaculate Conception High School, graduating in 1959. Ammiano competed successfully on the school&#x27;s track team and earned a varsity letter that he never received, apparently because he was perceived to be gay, an experience that he described as &quot;humiliating&quot;. After discussing the long-time slight on the radio in 2020 while being interviewed about his book &quot;Kiss My Gay Ass&quot;, a listener reached out to the school and pleaded his case &quot;in the interest of healing old wounds&quot;. After confirming his qualifications with a former coach and a team captain, the school relented in 2021 and sent him a letter to mark his accomplishments.

Ammiano attended Seton Hall University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communication in 1963. Hoping to leave New Jersey as far as possible in the distance he moved to San Francisco in 1963, and earned a master&#x27;s degree in special education from San Francisco State University in 1965. Ammiano was opposed to the Vietnam War and from 1966 to 1968 was an English teacher in a small town in South Vietnam, serving with a Quaker development group.

==Career in education and comedy==
After returning to San Francisco, Ammiano was a special-education teacher at Buena Vista Elementary School in the Mission. In 1975, he was one of the founders of the Gay Teachers Caucus which successfully pushed the school board to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Ammiano also came out publicly as a gay man in a news conference that year, and became one of the first public-school teachers in San Francisco to do so.

In 1980, Ammiano began to perform stand-up comedy.

==Political activism and career==
===Briggs Initiative===
In 1977, Ammiano, with activists Hank Wilson and Harvey Milk, co-founded &quot;No on 6&quot; against the Briggs Initiative, which would have banned any gay person from teaching in California. The movement achieved success the following year, in 1978.

===San Francisco Board of Education===
In 1980 and 1988, Ammiano ran for the San Francisco Board of Education, and was elected in 1990. He was subsequently elected its vice-president in 1991, and then president in 1992. As president of the Board of Education, Ammiano was successful in his efforts to include a gay and lesbian sensitivity curriculum for all students in the San Francisco Unified School District.

===San Francisco Board of Supervisors ===
Among his accomplishments on the Board of Supervisors is the creation of the San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance, which was passed by a unanimous vote of the Board of Supervisors and signed by Mayor Gavin Newsom on August 7, 2006. This made San Francisco the first city in the nation to provide universal healthcare access. Ammiano was the main architect of the city&#x27;s Domestic Partners Ordinance, which provides equal benefits to employees and their unmarried domestic partners. It requires companies which do business with the City and County of San Francisco to provide the same benefits. 

In 1999, Ammiano came into conflict with San Francisco&#x27;s Roman Catholic community when the Board of Supervisors, at Ammiano&#x27;s request, granted the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a charity group of drag queen nuns, a street-closure permit for Castro Street for their 20th anniversary celebration on Easter Sunday.

===1999 mayoral campaign===

In the San Francisco mayoral race of 1999, Ammiano mounted a successful write-in campaign in the November election, preventing the incumbent Willie Brown from achieving a victory without a run-off. While Ammiano lost that second election in December, Ammiano&#x27;s campaign galvanized more radical voters in San Francisco, and had a major impact on the composition of the new, more liberal Board of Supervisors the next year. There is a documentary about the 1999 mayoral election, titled &quot;See How They Run&quot;.

===California State Assembly===

====Marijuana law reform efforts====
Ammiano introduced Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act, to the California State Assembly. The bill, introduced by Ammiano in February 2009, calling for the legalization of cannabis statewide and provided for regulation of marijuana like alcohol, with people over 21 years old allowed to grow, buy, sell and possess cannabis. With the state&#x27;s severe budget shortfalls the bill was discussed in light of revenue generation as well as savings from decriminalizing and prosecuting marijuana-focused possession crimes. The bill failed the assembly&#x27;s Public Safety committee by a 3–4 vote on January 12, 2010.

Ammiano introduced a bill in a subsequent Assembly to create a new statewide entity within the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to regulate and license medical marijuana in California, arguing that a patchwork of local regulations had led to the proliferation of both &quot;legitimate and illegitimate operations&quot; in the state. The bill failed by a 27–30 vote, with 22 not voting, in May 2014.

====A.B. 1266====
Ammiano authored legislation, the School Success and Opportunity Act (Assembly Bill No. 1266), which &quot;requires that a pupil be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs, activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil&#x27;s records.&quot;

The legislation passed the California State Legislature in June 2013 and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in August 2013. The legislation went into effect on January 1, 2014. The bill was opposed by the California Catholic Conference, which viewed the law as unnecessary.

A group of activists made an attempt to repeal the law through a California ballot initiative, but in February 2014, the effort failed after it fell &quot;about 17,000 signatures short of the 504,760 valid names needed to go before voters.&quot;

===Schwarzenegger acrostic memo===
In October 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared at a Democratic Party fundraiser at San Francisco&#x27;s Fairmont Hotel. When former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown introduced the governor, Ammiano shouted &quot;You lie!&quot; in a copy-cat of Representative Joe Wilson&#x27;s remarks during President Obama&#x27;s congressional address a month earlier. Ammiano walked out yelling that Schwarzenegger could &quot;kiss my gay ass&quot;. In a video of the event, an audience member is heard yelling &quot;Kiss my &quot;faggot&quot; ass!&quot; at Schwarzenegger, leading some to conclude that &quot;faggot&quot; was what Ammiano actually said, and that &quot;gay ass&quot; was a censored version of the quote. However, Ammiano did not use the word &quot;faggot&quot;, and the person yelling &quot;kiss my faggot ass&quot; was someone else.

Four days after the fundraiser, Schwarzenegger vetoed Assembly Bill 1176, which was authored by Ammiano to help the port of San Francisco with financing issues, and had cleared the State Senate 40–0 and the Assembly 78–0. Schwarzenegger sent a memo to the California State Assembly explaining the veto. The letter contained a hidden message that, when using the first letter of each line along the left margin, spelled out &#x27;fuck you&#x27;. Governor Schwarzenegger denied the hidden message was inserted intentionally, but media outlets consulted a mathematics professor, who reportedly determined that the odds that it was simply a coincidence were astronomical.

On an October 30, 2019, appearance on &quot;The Late, Late Show with James Corden&quot;, Schwarzenegger admitted that he had intentionally added the message and later lied about not knowing the message was in the memo.

==Personal life==
Ammiano&#x27;s partner of many years was Tim Curbo, a fellow schoolteacher. Curbo died of complications from AIDS in 1994, days before Ammiano was elected supervisor.

Ammiano portrayed himself in a paid cameo appearance in the film &quot;Milk&quot; (2008), reenacting one of his protests of the Briggs Initiative.

<text>Robert Blakely Hays (born July 24, 1947) is an American actor, known for a variety of television and film roles since the 1970s. He came to prominence around 1980, co-starring in the two-season domestic sitcom &quot;Angie&quot;, and playing the central role of pilot Ted Striker in the comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot; and its sequel. Other film roles include the lead role in the comedy &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot; (1981), and Bob Seaver, one of the main human characters in &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; (1993). On television, he starred in the science fiction series &quot;Starman&quot; (1986–1987) and the short-lived workplace sitcom &quot;FM&quot; (1989–1990), voiced Iron Man in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1994), and had a guest role as Bud Hyde on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (2000).

==Career==
In 1977, Hays played a military corporal in an episode of the television series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. He starred in several short-lived television series, including the 1978 production &quot;The Young Pioneers&quot; on ABC; the 1979–1980 series &quot;Angie&quot;; &quot;Starman&quot;, and &quot;FM&quot;. 

He was cast as Ted Striker, the washed up pilot who needs to save the day in &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), a spoof of disaster films such as the &quot;Airport&quot; series, and returned for &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;.

<doc id="1328336" wikidata="Q7609634" url="?curid=1328336" title="Stephen Juba">
<text>Stephen Juba (July 1, 1914 – May 2, 1993) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1953 to 1959, and served as the 37th Mayor of Winnipeg from 1957 to 1977. He was the first Ukrainian Canadian to hold high political office in the city.

==Early life==
He was born in Winnipeg to Gregory Juba (1885–1958, originally &quot;Dziuba&quot;) and Sophia Mosata (1888–1970) who both came from Horokok, Ukraine. He married Jennie Brow on April 14, 1946 at Holy Ghost Ukrainian Catholic Church in Brooklands, Manitoba. They divorced in 1948. He would then marry Elva. There were no children by either marriage. His brother, Daniel Harry Juba (1909–1986), was mayor of Brooklands, Manitoba. Juba Street in Brooklands was named after his brother.

Juba left school at age fifteen, when his family could no longer pay for his education. His father, a building contractor, saw his practice decline after the stock market crash of 1929. Juba worked in odd jobs for several years and started two small businesses before he was twenty-one: Weston Builders Ltd. and S.N. Juba &amp; Co. These names reflected Juba&#x27;s gift for self-promotion. Weston Builders Ltd. was not actually an incorporated company; Juba had simply added &quot;Ltd.&quot; to its name to make it &quot;look official&quot;. In the case of S.N. Juba &amp; Co., he added a fictitious middle initial because he thought it &quot;sounded good&quot;. He was largely unsuccessful as a businessman until 1945, when he started a wholesale distributing firm called Keystone Supply Ltd, which would make him wealthy.

==Political career==
Juba&#x27;s first forays into electoral politics were unsuccessful. He ran as an independent candidate in Winnipeg North Centre in the June 1949 Canadian federal election, against rising CCF star Stanley Knowles. He later acknowledged that he did not expect to win, but entered the race &quot;to gain experience&quot; and &quot;to be educated by an expert&quot;. He received only 694 votes, finishing a very distant fourth.

In the 1949 Manitoba general election in November, Juba ran in the riding of Winnipeg Centre as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot;, supporting the coalition government of Douglas Lloyd Campbell. The City of Winnipeg was divided into three provincial constituencies at the time, each of which elected four members by preferential balloting. Juba finished eighth with 1015 votes on the first ballot, and was eliminated on the fourth count.

He ran for the Winnipeg City Council in 1950 and 1952, and came surprisingly close to winning on the second occasion.

He challenged Winnipeg mayor Garnet Coulter later in 1952, and received 28,000 votes to Coulter&#x27;s 38,000; CCF candidate Donovan Swailes finished third with 22,000. Under the Alternative Voting system in use, Swailes&#x27; votes were transferred, mostly to Coulter who won the seat. Juba called for reform of the province&#x27;s liquor laws during this campaign.

In 1954 he ran for mayor again, this time placing second to alderman George Sharpe. Juba would be more successful in the next election.

==MLA==
With an increased civic profile, Juba ran again as an independent in the 1953 provincial election. He finished second in Winnipeg Centre, and secured election on the eighth count. During this election, Juba supported racetrack gambling to fund the provincial hospital system.

During his time as an MLA, Juba remained independent of party politics and was not committed to any particular ideology. His primary accomplishment was securing reform for the province&#x27;s outdated liquor laws.

Juba was also re-elected as an MLA in the provincial election of 1958, this time defeating CCF candidate Art Coulter in the redistributed, single-member riding of Logan. Dufferin Roblin led the Progressive Conservatives to a minority government that proved to be short-lived. He did not seek re-election again when it fell in 1959. He chose instead to concentrate on his responsibilities at city hall. He had been elected mayor of Winnipeg in 1956.

==Mayor of Winnipeg==
Juba ran for the mayor&#x27;s office again in 1956, and was successful. He would serve as mayor from then until 1977.

His 1956 win came, after a campaign in which he referred to Sharpe as Premier Campbell&#x27;s &quot;trained seal&quot;, and promised to fight harder for the city&#x27;s fair share of provincial revenues. On election day, Juba received 46,197 votes to Sharpe&#x27;s 44,266. Most of his support came from the city&#x27;s ethnically diverse north-end, and his election was seen as a major victory for the city&#x27;s non-British communities. One local newspaper described the result as a &quot;big upset&quot;, and provincial CCF leader Lloyd Stinson later called it &quot;a pretty shocking experience for South Winnipeg&quot;.

Winnipeg was the first city in North America to use a central emergency number (in 1959). It instituted the change at the urging of Mayor Juba.

Juba was a flamboyant mayor. He was skilled at using the media to win support for his causes. He was a strong promoter of Winnipeg on the world stage: in 1967, he oversaw the Pan-American Games in the city. Though he presented himself as a spokesman for marginalized groups in the city&#x27;s north end, he did not adhere to social democracy and often had a difficult relationship with the CCF and its successor, the NDP. Some have referred to him as a &quot;pro-business populist&quot;.

Juba supported the amalgamation of Winnipeg during the late 1960s. He convinced the NDP government led by Edward Schreyer to grant direct mayoral elections in the unified city. Schreyer had favoured a parliamentary model of government, in which the elected councillors would choose a mayor from among themselves.

Not surprisingly, Juba himself was elected the first mayor of the unified city in 1971. He was opposed by the city&#x27;s right-wing Independent Citizens&#x27; Election Committee during the 1970s, and frequently clashed with ICEC leader and Deputy Mayor Bernie Wolfe. Notwithstanding this, he also endorsed a variety of urban development projects that were promoted by ICEC leaders.

==Relationship with the NDP==
In 1966, Juba considered running in the provincial riding of Inkster against New Democrat Len Stevens, but withdrew after Sidney Green replaced Stevens as the NDP candidate.

While Juba was usually an ally of NDP Premier Edward Schreyer in the 1970s, he also frequently clashed with ministers such as Russell Doern over the allocation of provincial resources. During the 1977 provincial election, he campaigned against NDP candidates in several Winnipeg ridings.

==Ended his mayoralty 1977==
He was initially a candidate for re-election in the mayoral election of 1977, but unexpectedly withdrew at the last moment. Most suspect that he timed his departure to prevent Wolfe from succeeding him in 1980. ICEC opponent Robert Steen was able to win a narrow victory in the election which followed, primarily with support from Juba&#x27;s north-end base.

Juba made another unexpected foray into electoral politics in the provincial election of 1981, running as an independent candidate in his old riding of Logan. He was resoundingly defeated by NDP candidate Maureen Hemphill, and did not attempt any further comebacks after this.

==Legacy==
The Stephen Juba Park was opened in Winnipeg in 1984. In 1986, Michael Czuboka published &quot;Juba&quot;, a biography of the former mayor.

In 1970, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Later life==
Juba died at home in Petersfield in 1993 at the age of 78.

Elva Juba died in 1996.

<text>The golden-rumped sengi (Rhynchocyon chrysopygus) is a small African mammal. It is the largest species of the elephant shrew family along with its close relative the grey-faced sengi. It is classified as endangered.

== Taxonomy and description ==
The golden-rumped sengi is found in the northern coastal areas in and around Arabuko Sokoke National Park Mombasa in Kenya. Its name derives from the conspicuous golden fur on its hindquarters, distinctive golden coloration on its rump, and grizzled gold forehead contrasting with its dark reddish-brown color. The golden-rumped sengi has long muscular rear legs and shorter, less developed forelegs. Like other elephant shrews, this species has a long and flexible snout, which is where its genus gets its name. Its tail is largely black except for the last third, which is white with a black tip. On juveniles, the fur shows vestigial traces of a checkerboard pattern seen on giant sengis like the checkered elephant shrew.

== Reproduction ==
The golden-rumped sengi are monogamous and territorial behavior is seen in both males and females defending overlapping territories. They mate year round. Females give birth to one young in an approximate 42-day cycle. The newborn offspring are usually ready to leave the mother&#x27;s den after two weeks, and it takes approximately five days after leaving the nest for them to become fully independent in the wild. The male does not take part in any parental care of the newborns.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The golden-rumped sengi is a diurnal animal, which lives in densely vegetated forests, avoiding clear and open areas to help protect themselves from predators. Golden-rumped sengis build up to six nests at a time, alternating nests every night to leave no pattern for hunting predators to follow. It inhabits coastal regions and is found in moist, dense-brush forests and lowland semi-deciduous forests. Males have slightly larger home areas than females, and are more likely to trespass into neighboring territories, which makes them more vulnerable to predators.

== Ecology and behavior ==
Their diet consists of invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, insects and spiders. These animals root through the leaf litter for 80% of their day looking for grasshoppers, beetles, spiders and other small invertebrates. The golden-rumped sengi evolved various strategies to avoid predators, particularly snakes (such as black mambas and cobras) and the southern banded snake-eagle. This animal is fast, capable of running up to . When it detects a predator within its escape distance, it will adopt a defensive position and will try to escape taking advantage of its agility and speed. If, however, the predator is outside its escape distance, the sengis will advertise its presence by slapping the leaf litter, letting the predator know it has been spotted. In the event of a chase or an ambush, the golden-rumped&#x27;s flash of fur will often deflect the predator&#x27;s attention away from the head and onto the rump, which has thicker skin and could give them an opportunity to survive an attack. The protected rump is more pronounced in males than female, and this dermal shield is roughly three times thicker than the skin in the middle of its back. Each shrew maintains several nests so they cannot be easily found by leaving a trace or establishing a pattern.

== Threats and conservation ==

The golden-rumped sengi is classified as endangered largely due to a fragmented forest environment and anthropogenic factors. Their most notable population is in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in Kenya. They are subject to being caught in traps, but are not targeted as a source of food because of their poor taste. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that roughly 3,000 were caught yearly by trappers. Forest patrols have reduced trapping since then, but there are areas that are not patrolled, where trappers are able to trap freely. The Arabuko-Sokoke forest and other Kenyan forests where the shrews live, have the status of National Monuments, which prevents any further development, but does not particularly provide specific protection for them or for biodiversity. Due to their small populations, even though many are protected, their numbers are expected to continue to decline due to stochastic events and further anthropogenic disturbances.

<text>Harshad Shantilal Mehta (29 July 1954 – 31 December 2001) was an Indian stockbroker, businessman, and convicted fraudster. Mehta&#x27;s involvement in the 1992 Indian securities scam (about ) led him to gain infamy for market manipulation. 

Of the 27 criminal charges brought against Mehta, he was only convicted of four, before his death (by sudden heart attack) at age 47 in 2001. It was alleged that Mehta engaged in a massive stock manipulation scheme financed by worthless bank receipts, which his firm brokered for &quot;ready forward&quot; transactions between banks. Mehta was convicted by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of India for his part in a financial scandal valued at which took place on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The scandal exposed the loopholes in the Indian banking system and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) transaction system, and consequently the SEBI introduced new rules to cover those loopholes. He was on trial for 9 years, until he died at the end of 2001 from a heart attack.

==Early life==
Harshad Shantilal Mehta was born on 29 July 1954, at Paneli Moti, Rajkot district, in a Gujarati Jain family. His early childhood was spent in Borivali, where his father was a small-time textile businessman.

==Education==
He did his early study in Janta Public School, Camp 2 Bhilai. A cricket enthusiast, Mehta did not show any special promise in school and came to Mumbai after his schooling for studies and to find work. Mehta completed his B.Com in 1976 from Lala Lajpatrai College, Bombay and worked a number of odd jobs for the next eight years.

==Work and life==
In his early life, Mehta did jobs, often related to sales, including selling hosiery, cement, and sorting diamonds. Mehta started his career as a salesperson in the Mumbai office of New India Assurance Company Limited (NIACL). During this time, he got interested in the stock market and after a few days, resigned and joined a brokerage firm. In the early 1980s, he moved to a lower-level clerical job at the brokerage firm Harjivandas Nemidas Securities where he worked a jobber for the broker Prasann Pranjivandas Broker who he considered his &quot;Guru&quot;.

Over a period of ten years, beginning 1980, he served in positions of increasing responsibility at a series of brokerage firms. By 1990, he had risen to a position of prominence in the Indian securities industry, with the media (including popular magazines such as &quot;Business Today&quot;) touting him as &quot;Amitabh Bachchan of the Stock market&quot;.

Mehta founded Grow More Research and Asset Management, with the financial assistance of associates, when the BSE auctioned a broker&#x27;s card and actively started to trade in 1986. By early 1990, a number of eminent people began to invest in his firm and utilize his services. It was at this time that he began trading heavily in the shares of Associated Cement Company (ACC). The price of shares in the cement company eventually rose from 200 to nearly 9,000 due to a massive spate of buying from a set of brokers including Mehta. Mehta justified this excessive trading in ACC shares by stating that the stock had been undervalued, and that the market had simply corrected when it revalued the company at a price equivalent to the cost of building a similar enterprise; the so-called &quot;replacement cost theory&quot; that he had put forward.

During this period, especially in 1990–1991, the media portrayed a heightened deified image of Mehta, calling him &quot;The Big Bull&quot;. He was covered in a cover page article of a number of publications including the popular economic magazine &quot;Business Today&quot;, in an article titled &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. His flashy lifestyle of a sea facing 15,000 square feet penthouse in the tony area of Worli complete with a mini golf course and swimming pool, and his fleet of cars including a Toyota Corolla, Lexus LS400, and Toyota Sera were flashed in publications. These further exemplified his image at a time when these were rarities even for the rich people of India.

In criminal indictments later brought by the authorities, it was alleged that Mehta and his associates then undertook a much broader scheme, which resulted in manipulating the rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scheme was financed by supposedly collateralised bank receipts, which were in fact uncollateralised. The bank receipts were used in short-term bank-to-bank lending, known as &quot;ready forward&quot; transactions, which Mehta&#x27;s firm brokered. By the second half of 1991 Mehta had earned the nickname of the &quot;Big Bull&quot;, because he was said to have started the bull run in the stock market. Some of the people who worked in his firm included Ketan Parekh, who later would be involved in his own replicate scam.

==Background of the 1992 security fraud==

=== Bank funds scam ===
Up to the early 90&#x27;s banks in India were not allowed to invest in the equity markets. However, they were expected to post profits and to retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed interest bonds. Mehta cleverly squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of banks and pumped this money into the share market. He also promised the banks higher rates of interest, while asking them to transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for them from other banks. At that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and forward bonds from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in his account to buy shares, thus hiking up demand of certain shares (of good established companies like ACC, Sterlite Industries and Videocon) dramatically, selling them off, passing on a part of the proceeds to the bank and kept the rest for himself. This resulted in stocks like ACC (which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share) skyrocketing to nearly ₹9,000 in just 3 months.

=== Bank receipt fraud ===
Another instrument used in a big way was the bank receipt. In a ready forward deal, securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the securities a BR. The BR serves as a receipt from the selling bank, and also promises that the buyer will receive the securities they have paid for at the end of the terms.

Having figured this out, Mehta needed banks, which could issue fake BRs, or BRs not backed by any government securities.

Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to Mehta, plainly assuming that they were lending against government securities when this was not really the case.
He took the price of ACC from ₹200 to ₹9,000 (an increase of 4,400%). Since he had to book profits in the end, the day he sold was the day when the markets crashed.

===Outbreak of 1992 securities fraud===

On 23 April 1992, journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed illegal methods in a column in &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Mehta was dipping illegally into the banking system to finance his buying.

A typical ready forward deal involved two banks brought together by a broker in lieu of a commission. The broker handles neither the cash nor the securities, though that was not the case in the lead-up to the fraud. In this settlement process, deliveries of securities and payments were made through the broker. That is, the seller handed over the securities to the broker, who passed them to the buyer, while the buyer gave the cheque to the broker, who then made the payment to the seller. In this settlement process, the buyer and the seller might not even know with whom they had traded, either being known only to the broker. This the brokers could manage primarily because by now they had become market makers and had started trading on their account. To keep up a semblance of legality, they pretended to be undertaking the transactions on behalf of a bank.

Mehta used forged BRs to gain unsecured loans, and used several small banks to issue BRs on demand. Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to Mehta, mistakenly believing that they were lending against government securities. This money was used to drive up the prices of stocks in the stock market. When time came to return the money, the shares were sold for a profit and the BR was retired. The money due to the bank was returned.

This went on as long as the stock prices rose, and no one knew about Mehta&#x27;s operations. Once the fraud was exposed, though, many banks were left holding worthless BRs – the banking system had been swindled out of a whopping . They knew that they would be accused if people discovered his involvement in issuing cheques to Mehta. Subsequently, it transpired that Citibank, brokers like Pallav Sheth and Ajay Kayan, industrialists like Aditya Birla, Hemendra Kothari, a number of politicians, and the RBI Governor S.Venkitaramanan all had allowed or facilitated Mehta&#x27;s market manipulation.

<text>The Asian Tour is the principal men&#x27;s professional golf tour in Asia except for Japan (which has its own Japan Golf Tour). It is also a full member of the International Federation of PGA Tours. Official money events on the tour count for Official World Golf Ranking points.

The Asian Tour is administered from Singapore. It is controlled by a board with a majority of professional golfers, and a Tournament Players Committee of its player members, supported by an executive team. The chairman of the board is the Indonesian businessman Jimmy Masrin.

==History==
The Asian PGA was formed in July 1994 at a meeting in Hong Kong attended by PGA representatives from eight countries. The first season of the APGA Omega Tour, as it was known for sponsorship reasons, was played in 1995 and within a few years it had supplanted the existing tour in the region, the Asia Golf Circuit that was run by the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation, as the leading golf tour in Asia outside of Japan. In 1998 the Asian Tour became the sixth member of the International Federation of PGA Tours. Under a new sponsorship deal, between 1999 and 2003 the tour was known as the Davidoff Tour, before adopting its current name in 2004.

In 2002, the tour moved its office from Hong Kong to Malaysia and in 2004 the tour was taken over by a new organisation established by the players, who had been in dispute with the previous management. In 2007 it moved to new headquarters on the resort island of Sentosa in Singapore, which is also the home to what was at that time the tour&#x27;s richest sole sanctioned tournament, the Singapore Open.

In 2009 a rival tour, the OneAsia Tour, was established. Relations between the two tours are hostile.

In 2010, the Asian Tour launched the Asian Development Tour (ADT) as a developmental circuit. Five events were played the first year. By 2015 the tour had expanded to holding 28 tournaments with US$2.2 million of prize money.

With LIV Golf&#x27;s initial investment in the Asian Tour having been reported in late 2021. The 2022 season marked the introduction of the International Series, which was unveiled in February. The series was to consist of 10 events to be added to Asian Tour schedules over the following 10 years, with each event featuring prize funds between and $2,000,000. The investment being primarily backed by LIV Golf.

==Players==
Most of the leading players on the tour are Asian, but players from other parts of the world also participate (as of 2007 the country with most representatives profiled on the tour&#x27;s official site is Australia).

In 2006 the Asian Tour became the most prestigious men&#x27;s tour on which a woman has made the half-way cut in recent times when Michelle Wie did so at the SK Telecom Open in South Korea.

Among the ways to obtain an Asian Tour card is to be among the top 35 (including ties) at the Tour&#x27;s qualifying school, finishing in the top 5 of the Asian Development Tour Order of Merit, and placing in the top 60 of the previous season&#x27;s Order of Merit. The winner of the Asian Tour Order of Merit also receives entry into The Open Championship.

==Tournaments and prize money==
Each year the Asian Tour co-sanctions a number of events with the European Tour, with these events offering higher prize funds than most of the other tournaments on the tour as a result. While most of these tournaments have been in Asia, the Omega European Masters in Switzerland has been co-sanctioned from 2009 to 2017. In addition, the two tours sometimes tri-sanction events with the Sunshine Tour or PGA Tour of Australasia in those tours&#x27; respective regions. The Asian Tour also co-sanctions tournaments with the Japan Golf Tour.

Since 2008, 50 percent of players&#x27; earnings from the US Open and The Open Championship have counted towards the Asian Tour&#x27;s Order of Merit. The two Opens were singled out from the other majors because they have open qualifying which Asian Tour members may enter.

Formerly Asia&#x27;s richest event, the HSBC Champions, was first played in November 2005 with a prize fund of $5 million. The tournament was co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and the earnings were counted towards the money list for its first three years before it became a World Golf Championships event in 2009.

Another limited-field event in Malaysia; the CIMB Classic, was launched in 2010 with a $6 million purse. The first Asian Tour event to be co-sanctioned by the U.S.-based PGA Tour began as an unofficial event on that tour, but it started to offer official money and FedEx Cup points in 2013.

In 2016, the tour&#x27;s richest sole-sanctioned event was the Venetian Macao Open, with a prize fund of $1.1 million.

In 2022, the Saudi International became the tour&#x27;s flagship event and as a result became its richest sole-sanctioned event.

<text>John Chester Culver (August 8, 1932 – December 26, 2018) was an American politician, writer, and lawyer who was elected to both the United States House of Representatives (1965–1975) and United States Senate (1975–1981) from Iowa. He was a member of the Democratic Party. His son Chet Culver served as the 41st governor of Iowa (2007–2011).

==Early life and education==
Culver was born in Rochester, Minnesota, the son of Mary C. (Miller) and William C. Culver. He moved as a child with his family to Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Culver graduated from both Harvard University and Harvard Law School. As an undergraduate, he played fullback on the Harvard football team with future U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy. He was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals in the 27th round of the 1954 NFL draft. Rather than try out for professional football after graduating, Culver attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as the Lionel de Jersey Harvard Scholar.

After his return to the U.S., he served in the military as a captain in the United States Marine Corps from 1955 to 1958.

In 1978 Culver was inducted into the Harvard Football Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Culver became active in politics, working as a legislative assistant for Senator Edward Kennedy in 1962. He began his law practice in Iowa a year later. In 1964, he ran against Republican U.S. Representative James E. Bromwell. With President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory, many Democrats, including Culver, were carried to victory.

In 1974, Culver ran for the U.S. Senate, narrowly defeating Davis Stanley with 52% of the vote for the seat left open by the retirement of Harold E. Hughes. Culver served one term in the Senate, from 1975 until 1981. With Ronald Reagan&#x27;s national victory as president, Culver was defeated in 1980 by Republican Chuck Grassley, taking 46% of the vote to Grassley&#x27;s 53%.

In 2000, Culver co-wrote &quot;American Dreamer&quot;, the first comprehensive biography of Henry A. Wallace.

Culver was a featured speaker at the August 28, 2009, memorial service for Edward Kennedy, speaking as his Harvard classmate and teammate, Senate colleague, and longtime friend.

Until January 31, 2011, Culver was the interim director of the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was succeeded by former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson. Culver remained on the board of advisers as director emeritus.

==Personal life and death==

John Culver and his wife had five children, including Chet, who served as governor of Iowa from 2007 to 2011.

At the time of his death, Culver was recently retired from the firm of Arent Fox in Washington, D.C., where he had established the government affairs practice. After leaving the Senate, he lived and worked in the capital with his wife, Mary Jane Checchi.

Culver died on December 26, 2018, at age 86.

<text>Yevgenia Solomonovna Ginzburg (December 20, 1904 – May 25, 1977) () was a Soviet writer who served an 18-year sentence in the Kolyma Gulag. Her given name is often Latinized to Eugenia.

==Family and early career==
Born in Moscow, her parents were Solomon Natanovich Ginzburg (a Jewish pharmacist) and Revekka Markovna Ginzburg. The family moved to Kazan in 1909.

In 1920, she began to study social sciences at Kazan State University, later switching to pedagogy. She worked as a &quot;rabfak&quot; (рабфак, рабочий факультет, workers&#x27; faculty) teacher. In April 1934, Ginzburg was officially confirmed as a docent (approximately equivalent to an associate professor in western universities), specializing in the history of the All-Union Communist Party. Shortly thereafter, on May 25, she was named head of the new department of the history of Leninism. By the fall of 1935, she was forced to quit the university.

She first married a doctor Dmitriy Fedorov, by whom she had a son, Alexei Fedorov, born in 1926. He died in 1941 during the siege of Leningrad. Around 1930, she married Pavel Aksyonov, the mayor (председатель горсовета) of Kazan and a member of the Central Executive Committee (ЦИК) of the USSR. Her son by this marriage, Vasily Aksyonov, born in 1932, became a well-known writer. After becoming a Communist Party member, Ginzburg continued her career as an educator, journalist and administrator.

==Persecution==
Following the assassination of Sergei Mironovich Kirov on December 1, 1934, Ginzburg, like many communists (see the Great Purge), was accused of participating in a &quot;counter-revolutionary Trotskyist group&quot; led by Professor Nikolay Naumovich Elvov and concentrated in the editorial board of the newspaper &quot;Krasnaya Tatariia&quot; (Red Tataria) where she was employed. After a long fight to keep her party card, she was expelled from the party, officially excluded on February 8, 1937. On February 15, 1937, she was arrested, accused of engaging in counter-revolutionary activity in El&#x27;vov&#x27;s group and concealing this activity. Because she was a party member throughout this alleged activity, she was also accused of &quot;playing a double game&quot;. From the day of her arrest, and unlike most of those around her, she forcefully denied the NKVD&#x27;s accusations and never accepted any role in the supposed &quot;counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization&quot;. As recorded in her initial interrogation, when asked whether she recognized her guilt, she responded &quot;I do not acknowledge it. I have not engaged in any Trotskyist struggle with the party. I have not been a member of a counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization.&quot; &#x27;

Her parents were also arrested but released two months later. Her husband was arrested in July and sentenced to 15 years of &quot;corrective labor&quot; and his property confiscated under Articles 58-7 and 11 of the RSFSR Penal Code.

===Trial===
On August 1, 1937, although Ginzburg still did not recognize her supposed guilt (despite the NKVD&#x27;s repeated, ruthless interrogations), a closed meeting of the Military College of the Supreme Court of the USSR (in Moscow) sentenced her to 10 years imprisonment with deprivation of political rights for five years and confiscation of her personal property. The judgement was declared to be final with no possibility of appeal. Ginzburg later wrote in a letter to the chairman of the Presidium of the USSR&#x27;s Supreme Soviet that her entire &quot;trial&quot; took seven minutes, including the questioning and reading of the judgement: &quot;My judges were in such a hurry that they did not answer any of my questions and declarations.&quot;. In one of the most revealing chapters of her autobiography, Ginzburg expressed great &quot;relief&quot; upon hearing the verdict, because she had feared up to that very moment that she would be condemned to death:

To live! Without property, but what was that to me? Let them confiscate it – they were brigands anyway, confiscating was their business. They wouldn&#x27;t get much good out of mine, a few books and clothes – why, we didn&#x27;t even have a radio. My husband was a loyal Communist of the old stamp, not the kind who had to have a Buick or a Mercedes... Ten years!... Do you [the judges], with your codfish faces, really think you can go on robbing and murdering for another ten years, that there aren&#x27;t people in the Party who will stop you sooner or later? I knew there were – and in order to see that day, I must live. In prison, if needs be, but I must at all costs live!... I looked at the guards, whose hands were still clasped behind my back. Every nerve in my body was quivering with the joy of being alive. What nice faces the guards had! Peasant boys from Ryazan or Kursk, most likely. They couldn&#x27;t help being warders – no doubt they were conscripts. And they had joined hands to save me from falling. But they needn&#x27;t have – I wasn&#x27;t going to fall. I shook back my hair curled so carefully before facing the court, so as not to disgrace the memory of Charlotte Corday. Then I gave the guards a friendly smile. They looked at me in astonishment.

===Imprisonment and exile===
Yevgenia experienced at first hand the infamous Lefortovo and Butyrka prisons in Moscow, and the Yaroslavl &quot;Korovniki&quot;. She crossed the USSR on a prison train to Vladivostok and was put in the cargo hold of the steamer &quot;Jurma&quot; (Джурма) whose destination was Magadan. There she worked at a camp hospital but was soon sent to the harsh camps of the Kolyma valley, where she was assigned to so-called &quot;common jobs&quot; and quickly became an emaciated &quot;dokhodyaga&quot; (&quot;goner&quot;). A Crimean German doctor, Anton Walter, probably saved her life by recommending her for a nursing position in Taskan; they eventually married. Anton had been deported because of his German ancestry. In February 1949, Ginzburg was released from the Gulag system but was ordered to remain in the town of Magadan for five further years. She found a position at a kindergarten and began to write her memoirs in secret. In October 1949, she was arrested again and exiled to the Krasnoyarsk region but (at her request) her destination was changed to Kolyma at the last minute. No reason was ever given for this second arrest and exile. After conversion of her status from detained to exiled, she could marry Walter. The couple adopted an orphan detainee girl, Antonina, later an actress (Antonina Pavlovna Aksyonova).

==Rehabilitation and later life==
After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and following Ginzburg&#x27;s repeated, vigorous appeals to various authorities to have her case reconsidered, she was released from the exile (on 25 June 1955) and allowed to return to Moscow. She was rehabilitated on June 25, 1955 due to the lack of &quot;corpus delicti&quot;.

She returned to Moscow, worked as a reporter and continued her work on her magnum opus, her memoir &quot;Journey into the Whirlwind&quot; (English title). After her husband&#x27;s death in 1959, Yevgenia finished the book in 1967 but was unable to publish it in the USSR. The manuscript was then smuggled abroad and published in 1967 by Mondadori in Milan and Possev in Frankfurt am Main; it has since been translated into many languages. Eventually, her memoir was divided into two parts, whose Russian titles are &quot;Krutoi marshrut I&quot; and &quot;Krutoi marshrut II&quot; -- &quot;Harsh Route&quot; or &quot;Steep Route.&quot; She died in Moscow, aged 72.

== Film ==
A Ginzburg biopic, titled, &quot;Within the Whirlwind&quot; was filmed by director Marleen Gorris in 2008. The film features actress Emily Watson as Yevgenia Ginzburg, with Pam Ferris and Ben Miller in other roles. It was released in 2010.

<text>Dorobo (or &quot;Ndorobo&quot;, &quot;Wadorobo&quot;, &quot;dorobo&quot;, &quot;Torobo&quot;) is a derogatory umbrella term for several unrelated hunter-gatherer groups of Kenya and Tanzania. They comprised client groups to the Maasai and did not practice cattle pastoralism.

==Etymology==
The term &#x27;Dorobo&#x27; derives from the Maa expression &quot;il-tóróbò&quot; (singular &quot;ol-torróbònì&quot;) &#x27;hunters; the ones without cattle&#x27;. Living from hunting wild animals implies being primitive, and being without cattle implies being very poor in the pastoralist Maa culture.

==Classifications==
In the past it has been assumed that all Dorobo were of Southern Nilotic origin; accordingly, the term &quot;Dorobo&quot; was thought to denote several closely related ethnic groups.

Groups that have been referred to as Dorobo include: 
*Kaplelach Okiek and Kipchornwonek Okiek (Nilotic; Rift Valley Province, Kenya)
*Sengwer
*Mukogodo-Maasai (the former Yaaku, sometimes Aramanik) (Yaaku language; Laikipia District, Rift Valley Province, Kenya)
*Aasax (Aasa language; northern Tanzania)
*Akie (sometimes Mosíro, which is an Akie clan name) (Nilotic, northern Tanzania)
*Mediak (Kalenjin, northern Tanzania)
*Kisankasa (Kalenjin, northern Tanzania)
*Aramanik (Kalenjin, Tanzania)
*Mosiro (Kalenjin, Tanzania)
*Omotik

==Relations with neighbours==
A historical survey of 17 Dorobo groups in northern Kenya found that they each maintained a close rapport with their surrounding territory through their foraging. Speaking the same language as their nomadic pastoralist neighbours, they would maintain peaceful relations with them and accepted a lower status. Occasional intermigration and intermarriage between the two groups was even possible. If the political landscape shifted and new pastoralists entered the area, then the local Dorobo would switch to the new language and build up new relations, while clinging to their territorial niche.

<text>Edie and the Eggs were a punk/celebrity-exploitation band featuring Edith Massey, known for acting in several films by John Waters. The band&#x27;s name referred to Massey&#x27;s character in &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, who had an obsession with eating eggs and romanced an egg delivery man. Massey sometimes wore her bizarre leather costume from the film &quot;Female Trouble&quot; during gigs.

Edie and the Eggs included future Go-Go&#x27;s drummer Gina Schock and Ann Collier, guitar player of Rhumboogie, a well-known all-female rock and roll band during 1974-78 from Baltimore. Ann Collier is the person who put the group Edith and the Eggs together after being asked to do so by John Waters.

They performed at CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City in New York City along with a few other engagements. Ann was asked by the Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles to bring the act out there for a number of shows. At that time Ann asked Edith, Gina Schock and Suzan Wirth (bass player) if they would like to go to California. The shows were mostly sold out and a hit; however, none of the members ever received any money for their efforts, with NetArt management saying they (the company) had overspent on the engagement. All the musicians returned to Baltimore. Edith Massey died a few years later; Gina Schock went back to California and joined the Go-Go&#x27;s; and Suzan Wirth adopted a child and became a mother.

Ann Collier continued to play rock and roll music, and still does in Baltimore. 

In 1982, Edie and the Eggs recorded a cover of The Four Seasons&#x27;s &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, backed with &quot;Punks, Get off the Grass&quot;, both of which were performed in The Eggs&#x27; punk stylings. The &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; cover was featured on the compilation album &quot;The Rhino Brothers Present the World&#x27;s Worst Records&quot; shortly after the single&#x27;s release. The song was later featured on the John Waters compilation, &quot;A Date with John Waters&quot;.

<text>is a form of traditional Japanese comic theater.

Its contents are nevertheless not at all similar to the formal, symbolic, and solemn &quot;Noh&quot; theater; &quot;kyōgen&quot; is a comic form, and its primary goal is to make its audience laugh. 

&quot;Kyōgen&quot; together with &quot;Noh&quot; is part of &quot;Nōgaku&quot; theatre.

&quot;Kyōgen&quot; is sometimes compared to the Italian comic form of commedia dell&#x27;arte, which developed in the early 17h century, and likewise features stock characters. It also has parallels with the Greek satyr play, a short, comical play performed between tragedies.

==History==
One of the oldest ancestors of kyogen is considered to be a comical mimicry, which was one of the arts constituting Sangaku (:ja:散楽), and Sangaku was introduced to Japan from China in the Nara period in the 8th century. In the Heian period (794－1185), sangaku developed into sarugaku by merging with Japanese traditional performing arts such as dengaku, and in the Kamakura period (1185－1333), it was divided into Noh, which was a drama of serious singing and dancing, and kyogen, which was a comical speech and play. When Kan&#x27;ami and Zeami completed Noh in the style known today in the early Muromachi period (1333－1573) in the 14th century, Kyōgen was a simple and comical short play different from the style known today, and performers of kyōgen were under the control of a Noh troupe. In the late Muromachi period, kyōgen as a form of theater was developed and the Ōkura school was established by kyōgen performers. In the Edo period (1606－1868), Sagi school and Izumi school were established. Since the Tokugawa shogunate designated kyōgen and Noh as ceremonial arts in the Edo period, kyōgen performers of these three schools were employed by the Tokugawa shogunate, each daimyō (feudal lord) and the Imperial Court, and kyōgen also developed greatly.

Kyōgen provided a major influence on the later development of kabuki theater. After the earlier, more ribald forms of kabuki had been outlawed in the mid-17th century, the government permitted the establishment of the new &quot;yarō-kabuki&quot; (men&#x27;s kabuki) only on the grounds that it refrain from the previous kabuki forms&#x27; lewdness and instead model itself after kyōgen.

Noh had been the official entertainment form of the Edo period, and was therefore subsidized by the government. Kyōgen, performed in conjunction with Noh, also received the patronage of the government and the upper class during this time. Following the Meiji Restoration, however, this support ceased. Without government support, Noh and kyōgen went into decline, as many Japanese citizens gravitated toward the more &quot;modern&quot; Western art forms. In 1879, however, then-former US President Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, while touring Japan, expressed an interest in the traditional art of Noh. They became the first Americans to witness Noh and kyōgen plays and are said to have enjoyed the performance. Their approval is believed to have sparked a revival of interest in these forms.

In modern Japan, kyōgen is performed both separately and as a part of Noh. When performed as part of a Noh performance, kyōgen can take three forms: a separate (comic) kyōgen play, performed between two Noh plays (inter-Noh), which is known as , as a (non-comic) scene &quot;within&quot; a Noh play (intra-Noh, between two scenes), which is known as , or as .

In aikyōgen, most often the main Noh actor (&quot;shite&quot;) leaves the stage and is replaced by a , who then explains the play (for the benefit of the audience), though other forms are also possible – the aikyōgen happening at the start, or the kyōgen actor otherwise interacting with the Noh actors. As part of Noh, aikyōgen is &quot;not&quot; comic – the manner (movements, way of speech) and costume are serious and dramatic. However, the actor is dressed in a kyōgen outfit and uses kyōgen-style language and delivery (rather than Noh language and delivery) – meaning simpler, less archaic language, delivered closer to a speaking voice – and thus can generally be understood by the audience, hence the role in explaining the play. Thus, while the costume and delivery are kyōgen-&quot;style&quot; (kyōgen in &quot;form&quot;), the clothing will be more elegant and the delivery less playful than in separate, comic kyōgen. Before and after aikyōgen, the kyōgen actor waits (kneeling in seiza) at the at the end of the bridge (&quot;hashigakari&quot;), close to the stage.

The traditions of kyōgen are maintained primarily by family groups, especially the Izumi school and Ōkura school.

==Elements==
Kyōgen plays are invariably brief – often about 10 minutes, as traditionally performed between acts of Noh – and often contain only two or three roles, which are often stock characters. Notable ones include , , and .

Movements and dialogue in kyōgen are typically very exaggerated, making the action of the play easy to understand. Elements of slapstick or satire are present in most kyōgen plays. Some plays are parodies of actual Buddhist or Shinto religious rituals; others are shorter, more lively, simplified versions of Noh plays, many of which are derived from folktales. As with Noh, jo-ha-kyū is a fundamental principle, which is particularly relevant for movement.

As with Noh and kabuki, all kyōgen actors, including those in female roles, are men. Female roles are indicated by a particular piece of attire, a – a long white sash, wrapped around the head, with the ends hanging down the front of the body and tucked into the belt, like symbolic braids; at the two points (either side of the head) where the sash changes from being wrapped around to hanging down, the sash sticks up, like two small horns.

Similarly, actors play roles regardless of age – an old man may play the role of Tarō kaja opposite a young man playing master, for instance.

=== Costumes ===
Outfits are generally kamishimo (Edo period outfit consisting of kataginu top and hakama pants), with the master (if present) generally wearing nagabakama (long, trailing pants).

Actors in kyōgen, unlike those in Noh, typically do not wear masks, unless the role is that of an animal (such as a tanuki or kitsune), or that of a god. Consequently, the masks of kyōgen are less numerous in variety than Noh masks. Both masks and costumes are simpler than those characteristic of Noh. Few props are used, and minimal or no stage sets. As with Noh, a fan is a common accessory.

=== Language ===
The language in kyōgen depends on the period, but much of the classic repertoire is in Early Modern Japanese, reasonably analogous to Early Modern English (as in Shakespeare). The language is largely understandable to contemporary Japanese speakers, but sounds archaic, with pervasive use of the form rather than the form that is now used (see copula: Japanese). For example, when acknowledging a command, Tarō kaja often replies with , which in modern Japanese one uses . Further, some of the words and nuances cannot be understood by modern audience (without notes), as in Shakespeare. This contrasts with Noh, where the language is more difficult and generally not understandable to a contemporary audience.

There are numerous set patterns – stock phrases and associated gestures, such as &quot;kashikomatte-gozaru&quot; (with a bow) and &quot;Kore wa mazu nanto itasō. Iya! Itashiyō ga gozaru.&quot; &quot;So first, what to do. Aha! There is a way to do it.&quot;, performed while bowing and cocking head (indicating thought), followed by standing up with a start on &quot;Iya!&quot; Plays often begin with set phrases such as &quot;Kore wa kono atari ni sumai-itasu mono de gozaru.&quot; &quot;This is the person who resides in this place.&quot; and (if featuring Tarō kaja) often end with Tarō kaja running off the stage yelling &quot;Yaru-mai zo, yaru-mai zo!&quot; &quot;I won&#x27;t do it, I won&#x27;t do it!&quot;.

Lines are delivered in a characteristic rhythmic, sing-song voice, and generally quite loudly. Pace, pitch, and volume are all varied for emphasis and effect.

=== Movements ===

As with Noh, which is performed on the same stage, and indeed many martial arts (such as kendo and aikido) actors move via , sliding their feet, avoiding steps on the easily vibrated Noh stage. When walking, the body seeks to remain at the same level, without bobbing up or down. Plays also frequently feature stamping feet or otherwise hitting the ground (such as jumping) to take advantage of the stage.

As with Noh, angle of gaze is important, and usually a flat gaze is used (avoiding looking down or up, which create a sad or fierce atmosphere, which is to be avoided). Characters usually face each other when speaking, but turn towards the audience when delivering a lengthy speech.

Arms and legs are kept slightly bent. Unless involved in action, hands are kept on upper thighs, with fingers together and thumb tucked in – they move down to the sides of the knees when bowing.

=== Music ===
Kyōgen is performed to the accompaniment of music, especially the flute, drums, and gong. However, the emphasis of kyōgen is on dialogue and action, rather than on music or dance.

=== Space ===
Kyogen is generally performed on a Noh stage, as the stage is an important part of the play (the space, the reaction to stamps, the ease of sliding, etc.). It can, however, be performed in any space (particularly by amateur or younger performers), though if possible a Noh-like floor will be installed.

==Komai==
In addition to the kyōgen plays themselves, performances include short dances called . These are traditional dramatic dances (not comic), performed to a chanted accompaniment, and with varied themes. The movements are broadly similar to Noh dances. The often archaic language used in the lyrics and the chanted delivery means that these chants are often not understandable to a contemporary audience.

==Kyōgen today==
Today, kyōgen is performed and practiced regularly, both in major cities (especially Tokyo and Osaka) and throughout the country, and is featured on cultural television programs. In addition to the performances during Noh plays, it is also performed independently, generally in programs of three to five plays.

New kyogen are written regularly, though few new plays enter the repertoire. Particularly significant is , written and directed by Tetsuji Takechi in 1953, during his post-Kabuki theater work. Based on a medieval French farce, this play became the first new &quot;kyōgen&quot; to enter the traditional repertoire in a century. In rare cases bilingual kyōgen or fusion of kyōgen with Western forms has been done. An early example is the group &quot;Mei-no-kai,&quot; consisting of kyōgen, Noh, and shingeki actors, who staged Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1973; the kyōgen acting was best received. A notable example is the Noho Theatre group, based in Kyoto, under the direction of American Jonah Salz and primary acting by Akira Shigeyama. This group has performed a bilingual Japanese/English translation of &quot;Susugigawa&quot; termed &quot;The Henpecked Husband,&quot; together with works by Samuel Beckett, notably the mime &quot;Act Without Words I,&quot; performed by a kyōgen actor in Japanese theatrical style (first performed 1981). This latter features kyōgen movements and Japanese cultural adaptations – for example, the nameless character contemplates suicide not by holding scissors to his throat (as per stage directions), but to his stomach, as if contemplating hara-kiri. Unusually for a Beckett adaptation, which are usually strictly controlled by Beckett and his estate, this was presented to Beckett and met with his approval.

The distinctive diction of kyōgen is also occasionally used in other media, with kyōgen actors working as voice actors. An example is the animated movie by Kōji Yamamura, based on &quot;A Country Doctor&quot; by Franz Kafka, where the voices are performed by the Shigeyama family.

As with Noh, many Japanese are familiar with kyōgen only through learning about it in school or television performances. A play frequently featured in textbooks is , where the servants Tarō-kaja and Jirō-kaja are entrusted with some sugar by their master, but told not to eat it, as it is poison; naturally, they eat it. As with Noh, many professional performers are born into a family, often starting performing at a young age, but others are not born into families and beginning practicing in high school or college. Unlike Noh drama or nihonbuyō dance, who earn their living primarily via teaching and support from underlings in the iemoto system, but similar to rakugo comedy, professional kyōgen players earn their living from performing (possibly supplemented by side jobs), and maintain an active touring schedule. Due to the limited repertoire (a classical canon, of which many are no longer performed due to being dated, and few new plays enter) and frequent performances, a professional kyōgen actor can be expected to be familiar with all roles in all plays in their school&#x27;s repertoire, and to perform them with some regularity.

While there are a number of kyōgen families, there are at present two leading families: the Nomura 野村 family of Tokyo (traditionally Edo region), and the Shigeyama 茂山 family of Kyoto (traditionally Kamigata region) of the Ōkura school, both of which are often featured performing on TV, appear in the news, and tour overseas, and have been involved in popularizing and some efforts at modernizing kyōgen. See also the List of Living National Treasures of Japan (performing arts), whose kyōgen members feature individuals from these families, among others.

=== Foreign actors ===
In the post-war period, foreigners have participated in kyōgen as amateur performers. A notable early example was the 1956 performance by scholar and translator Donald Keene in the play with Tetsuji Takechi in the role of the sake shop owner, before an audience including such prominent authors as Tanizaki, Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima. This is featured in his series of essays, &quot;Chronicles of My Life in the 20th Century&quot;, and inspired the title of his anthology &quot;The Blue-Eyed Tarokaja: A Donald Keene Anthology.&quot; Today foreigners (resident in Japan, with sufficient Japanese skills) are able to practice with amateur troupes. In addition, since 1985, an intensive summer program (originally 6 weeks, now 3 weeks) in kyōgen for beginners has been run at the Kyoto Art Center, taught by Akira Shigeyama (of the Shigeyama family) and others, and organized by scholar of Japanese theater Jonah Salz.

==Plays==
There are a few hundred plays in the repertoire (about 180 in the Okura school), but many are now rarely performed, as the audience will not understand the jokes, or would deem them offensive (e.g., for making fun of a blind money-lender).

Plays commonly studied and performed by beginners, due to brevity and simplicity, include , 舟船, 土筆, 以呂波, and . &quot;Kuchimane&quot; in particular is frequently performed. Another well-known play, featured in textbooks, is , mentioned above.

Another play is (&quot;Kakiyamabushi&quot; or &quot;Persimmon Mountain Hermit&quot;), about an ascetic priest who hungers in the mountains; he uncovers and eats from a persimmon tree, which belongs to a farmer. The farmer catches him in the act and makes a fool out of the priest – getting the priest to pretend to be a crow, a monkey, and a large bird, causing him to fall from the tree. The priest later gets his revenge by chanting and summoning supernatural forces. But in the end, the farmer refuses to nurse the priest back to health.

==History==
===Early years===
The was founded on December 27, 1950.

After the end of World War II , Mainichi Shimbun intended to establish a private radio station, and the establishment of the radio station was placed in charge of the then editor-in-chief, Shinzo Takahashi. At the same time, Kansai businessmen Shinyoshi Terada and Aiji Iwasaki are also interested in getting involved in the broadcasting industry. The two hit it off immediately, and held a symposium on December 11, 1945, and decided to establish the &quot;New Japan Broadcasting&quot; company. However, at that time, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Japan preferred to continue the Japanese broadcasting industry&#x27;s monopoly system of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) (among the four Allied countries, especially the Soviet Union, NHK preferred to monopolize it), and did not allow private radio stations to be established, so this idea wasn&#x27;t quickly achieved.

From October 1947, the occupied government gradually began to favor allowing the establishment of private broadcasters. The &quot;New Japan Broadcasting&quot; plan was revived as a result, and received support from Keihanshin Kyuko Electric Railway (now Hankyu Electric Railway), Nippon Electric and other companies. On December 27, 1948, New Japan Broadcasting once again submitted an application for a broadcasting license, which was accepted on January 25 of the following year. With the passing of the &quot;Three Radio Laws&quot; (after the passing of the Radio Law, the Broadcasting Law, and the Law on the Establishment of the Radio Supervisory Committee) in 1950, the establishment of private broadcasting was officially permitted. On June 10 of the same year, New Japan Broadcasting held its first promoter meeting. On December 16, New Japan Broadcasting held a founding meeting and registered the company on December 27. At that time, 12 operators in the Kinki area, supported by Mainichi Shimbun, were most likely to obtain a license. Since Tokyo had successfully integrated various applicants into one company at that time, the Radio Supervision Committee also intended to replicate this process in Osaka, but it encountered strong opposition from both New Japan Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting. On April 21, 1951, New Japan Broadcasting received a preliminary license. On July 8, New Japan Broadcasting launched its first experimental radio wave. From August 15th to 31st, New Japan Broadcasting conducted a trial broadcast. At 11:59:30 on September 1, 1951, New Japan Broadcasting officially launched, and tied with Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting to become Japan&#x27;s first private radio station (but Chubu Nippon Broadcasting Station started at 6:30 in the morning). In February 1952, the New Japan Broadcasting Union was established.

Two years after the launch of New Japan Broadcasting, Nippon Television, Japan&#x27;s first private television station, launched. New Japan Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting also jointly applied for a television broadcasting license in the name of Osaka Television Broadcasting in August 1952, and obtained a preliminary license in December 1954, and officially established the company in May 1955. Although Osaka Television started broadcasting on December 1, 1956. However, both New Japan Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting believe that Osaka TV broadcasting is only a compromise decision when the number of channels is limited. After the Ministry of Postal and Postal Affairs revised the channel plan in May 1957 and allocated two private television channels in the Osaka area (one of which was an educational television station), New Japan Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting immediately began to establish their own television stations. However, in addition to Asahi Broadcasting and New Japan Broadcasting, there were also &quot;Kansai TV&quot; of the Sankei Shimbun Department, &quot;Kinki TV&quot; jointly formed by Kyoto Broadcasting and Kobe Broadcasting, &quot;New Osaka TV&quot; of the Yomiuri Shimbun Department, and those interested in acquiring educational television. Licensed respectively as &quot;Kinki Education and Culture Television&quot; and &quot;Kansai Education and Culture Broadcasting&quot;, a total of 7 operators applied for two television licenses; the competition is extremely fierce. After that, the comprehensive television license in Osaka area was obtained by &quot;Dai Kansai Television&quot; formed by the merger of &quot;Kansai Television&quot; and &quot;Kinki Television&quot; (the name was later changed back to Kansai Television). Asahi Broadcasting, New Japan Broadcasting, and Shin-Osaka Television turned to compete for educational television licenses. After Tanaka Kakuei took office as the Post Minister in July 1959, he used political skills to move the TV channel plan in the Himeji area to Osaka, so that two new private TV stations could be built in the Osaka area. Tanaka Kakuei also proposed in October of this year that the two new TV stations in the Osaka area should be acquired by one of New Osaka TV, New Japan Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting. However, the solution was to merge with Osaka TV Broadcasting without obtaining a new station license. Eventually, New Japan Broadcasting applied to obtain a new television license, and Hankyu Electric Railway Capital withdrew from New Japan Broadcasting. Asahi Broadcasting merged with Osaka Television Broadcasting. On October 22, New Japan Broadcasting obtained a television preliminary license.

NJB commenced radio broadcasting from the Hankyu Department Store on September 1, 1951, as the second commercial radio station in Japan.
NJB founded on December 1, 1956 with Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
NJB was renamed &quot;Mainichi Broadcasting System, Inc.&quot; on June 1, 1958.
On March 1, 1959, after selling all stocks of OTV to ABC, MBS started analog terrestrial television broadcasting independently from OTV, and made a network with Nippon Educational Television Co., Ltd. (NET, the predecessor of TV Asahi Corporation).
In 1960 a broadcasting studio was completed in Senri.

In 1964 MBS formed a radio network with TBS Radio and RKB Radio, which evolved into Japan Radio Network (JRN) in 1965.
in 1974 MBS joined the All-Nippon News Network (ANN).
However, MBS joined the Japan News Network (JNN) on March 31, 1975 due to then-president of the Asahi Shimbun&#x27;s order to the ABC to switch its flagship station to NET.
On May 15, 1977, the frequency of MBS Radio changed from 1210 kHz to 1180 kHz.

The American Broadcasting Company (ABC, not to be confused with the Asahi Broadcasting Corporation) acquired a 5% stake on New Japan Broadcasting in 1951 and remained as a shareholder in MBS through the 1970s; ABC retained 5% of all shares in 1977, making it the third largest shareholder at the time.
===Early years as MBS===
On June 1, 1958, New Japan Broadcasting changed the company name to Mainichi Broadcasting. At the same time, Mainichi Broadcasting set up a television studio on the 8th and 9th floors of the south building of the Mainichi Osaka Kaikan under construction, and built a signal transmitting station on the top of Ikoma Mountain. &quot;Kansai Education and Culture Broadcasting&quot;, which applied for an educational television license, also merged with MBS. Osaka Television Broadcasting has 88 employees participating at MBS. At the same time, due to the decision of KRT TV station (now TBS TV station) to maintain the network relationship with Osaka Television Broadcasting, Mainichi Broadcasting was faced with the dilemma of insufficient broadcast programs and had to change the broadcast date from December 1, 1958 to March 1959. On March 1, it established a network relationship with Nihon Educational Television (later renamed NET Television, now TV Asahi). At 10 a.m. on March 1, 1959, the MBS TV broadcast was officially launched.

In the early days of Mainichi Broadcasting, most of the entertainment programs came from NET stations, while most of the self-produced programs were educational programs. In 1963, the daily ratings of Mainichi Broadcasting were 7.5%, second only to NHK and Asahi Broadcasting&#x27;s 8.1%. The average ratings in the evening period are 14.6%, second only to Asahi Broadcasting&#x27;s 15.9%. In the mid-1960s, Mainichi Broadcasting participated in the establishment of Tokyo Channel 12 by the Japan Science and Technology Foundation. As Tokyo Channel 12 quickly fell into operating difficulties after its launch, Mainichi Broadcasting began to broadcast some self-produced programs on Tokyo Channel 12 in 1967, but the situation has not improved. Therefore, the financial circle once had the idea of merging Tokyo Channel 12 with Mainichi Broadcasting. However, due to opposition from the Mainichi Shimbun and Nihon Keizai Shimbun&#x27;s decision to rebuild Tokyo Channel 12, this idea could not be realized. However, Mainichi Broadcasting still has a cooperative relationship with Tokyo Channel 12 and broadcasts its own programs on Tokyo Channel 12. In 1967, the MBS TV license was changed from a quasi-educational station to a general comprehensive station, which could broadcast more entertainment programs. On April 1 of the same year, MBS began to broadcast color programs. In October 1970, all in-house MBS programs were in color. During the 1970 World Expo, Mainichi Broadcasting broadcast &quot;Good Morning Expo&quot; every day and produced and broadcast a series of special programs. In 1971, Mainichi Broadcasting Corporation stopped airing NET TV&#x27;s &quot;23rd Show&quot; on the grounds that the program content was too vulgar, causing a sensation in the Japanese television industry. In the same year, the daily average viewership rating was 8.8%, ranking first for the first time. In the same year, MBS&#x27;s TV division revenue also exceeded Asahi Broadcasting.

Mainichi Broadcasting began to strengthen international cooperation in the 1960s. It became an associate member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1969 and signed cooperation agreements with foreign television stations such as WGN-TV in the United States, Czechoslovak Television, ZDF in West Germany and TF1 in France. In 1962, Mainichi Broadcasting opened a North American branch in New York, becoming the third Japanese television station to open a base in there. Mainichi Broadcasting attaches great importance to international cultural cooperation and hosted the Kansai Performance of the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir in 1964.
===Changing networks===
When Mainichi Broadcasting withdrew from Osaka Television in 1958, Osaka Television&#x27;s successor, Asahi Broadcasting, inherited the network relationship between Osaka Television and TBS . This resulted in the fact that the affiliate network member station of Tokyo&#x27;s Mainichi Shimbun TV station TBS in Osaka is Asahi Broadcasting of Asahi Shimbun Capital, while the affiliate network member station of Tokyo&#x27;s Asahi Shimbun TV station NET in Osaka is the daily broadcast of Mainichi Shimbun Capital. There is a reversal in the relationship between Tokyo and Osaka TV station networks. In the early 1970s, Japan&#x27;s four national newspapers conducted an exchange of shares in television stations. The Asahi Shimbun and the Yomiuri Shimbun handed over their shares in TBS to the Mainichi Shimbun; the Asahi and the Mainichi Shimbun handed over their shares in Nippon TV to the Yomiuri; the Nikkei The equity of NET TV station was transferred to Asahi Shimbun. The Asahi Shimbun also requested Asahi Broadcasting Corporation to join the NET TV network. After TBS learned of this news, it invited Mainichi Broadcasting to join TBS&#x27;s network in the summer of 1974, and obtained Mainichi Broadcasting&#x27;s consent. On November 19, 1974, TBS and Mainichi Broadcasting jointly announced that Mainichi Broadcasting would join JNN starting from April 1, 1975. Compared with the ANN period, MBS&#x27;s broadcasts are broadcast every week during prime time, the duration of the program broadcast nationwide in Japan was reduced from 5 hours and 50 minutes to 3 hours and 50 minutes. National broadcast programs outside prime time were also reduced from 6 hours and 35 minutes to 4 hours and 55 minutes. At the same time, Mainichi Broadcasting will no longer broadcast Tokyo Channel 12 programs. Mainichi Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting also conducted large-scale program exchanges.

In the 1970s, TBS was known as the &quot;hero of private broadcasting&quot; and held a leading position in Japan&#x27;s private television industry. As a result, MBS&#x27;s ratings increased after switching networks. From October 1975 to March 1980, the MBS won the triple crown of ratings. High ratings also boosted advertising performance. Mainichi Broadcasting ranked first in prime time ratings for 26 consecutive weeks in the first half of 1978. In the same year, MBS&#x27;s revenue reached 30.15 billion yen, and the profit reached 5.12 billion yen. The revenue of both the television division and the radio division ranked first among Osaka stations. Beginning in the late 1970s, Mainichi Broadcasting took the lead in introducing electronic news gathering (ENG) among private stations in Osaka, which greatly improved its news gathering and editing capabilities. In 1978, Mainichi Broadcasting opened the Bonn branch, JNN&#x27;s 11th overseas branch. In 1986, Mainichi Broadcasting opened its second overseas branch, the Manila branch. In terms of technological innovation, Mainichi Broadcasting began broadcasting stereo TV in 1982, and began broadcasting data information in 1986. In 1989, MBS introduced Satellite News Relay (SNG) System.

On November 23, 1978 at 5:00am MBS Radio&#x27;s frequency was moved again from 1180 kHz to 1179 kHz.

In 1986, Mainichi Broadcasting regained the top position in advertising revenue among Osaka stations. In 1987, Mainichi Broadcasting&#x27;s turnover reached 53.518 billion yen and profit reached 6.233 billion yen, both setting high records at the time. Relying on the good times of Japan&#x27;s bubble economy, Mainichi Broadcasting&#x27;s revenue increased to 64.949 billion yen in 1990, with profits reaching 9.489 billion yen. Taking advantage of the introduction of satellite and cable TV in Japan, Mainichi Broadcasting participated in investing in Japan Satellite Broadcasting in 1983. In 1989, Mainichi Broadcasting joined with Sumitomo Corporation to invest in the establishment of SVN (Space Vision Network) company and began to establish their own satellite TV channels. In 1993, SVN changed its name to GAORA and became a sports-oriented satellite TV channel.

===Move to Chayamachi===
In 1990, the new headquarters and studios was completed in Chayamachi, Kita Ward, Osaka for the station&#x27;s 40th anniversary. MBS moved and merged the headquarters and studio on September 1; the registered headquarters from the Mainichi Shimbun Osaka Head Office, and the broadcasting studio from Senri.

MBS Now aired for the last time on September 29, 2000. It was replaced by Voice on October 2.

On May 15, 2010 MBS began to simulcast its radio broadcasts online within the Kansai region via together with ABC, OBC, FM 802, FM Osaka, and FM Cocolo.

The construction of the new building that was started in March 2011, located north of its head office, completed on September 4, 2013 named &quot;B Building&quot;. The headquarters building was named &quot;M Building&quot;.
On July 24, 2011, at noon, MBS, along with other television stations in the Kansai region, turned off its analog broadcast, as part of the digital television transition in most prefectures of Japan.
On October 1, 2013 the Takaishi Solar Plant was situated in the area of MBS Takaishi Radio Transmitter. 
On April 4, 2014, the B Building was opened.

===Restructuring===
On July 28, 2016, MBS announced that it would restructure as a holding company with the second incarnation of MBS taking over the radio and TV divisions. The restructuring was completed on April 1st of the following year with the company being rebranded to MBS Media Holdings. On April 1, 2021, the radio division was spun-off from Mainichi Broadcasting under the MBS Radio name.

<text>Regina Ann Schock (born August 31, 1957) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock band The Go-Go&#x27;s.

Schock was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in October 2021 as a member of The Go-Go&#x27;s.

== Early life ==
Regina Ann Schock was born in Baltimore, Maryland on August 31, 1957 to June and John Schock. She was raised in the nearby working-class suburb of Dundalk. She lived in the German Hill neighborhood. She was educated in private Catholic schools, attending Sacred Heart of Mary School and Catholic High School in Dundalk. She was a bit of a troublemaker in school but did not get into serious trouble. According to her mother, Schock never took drumming lessons, but had &quot;natural rhythm.&quot; When she was 13, she would come home from school, put on headphones and bang on the drums for hours, which was a challenge for her family to endure.

== Career ==

The first serious band Schock was in was Scratch N Sniff, which took gigs in local Baltimore area venues. However, Schock&#x27;s career began to take off as drummer for the female punk band, Edie and the Eggs. Schock grew up down the street from Edie and the band came together in about a week, then toured the U.S. Edie and the Eggs was a band assembled to feature the John Waters star Edith Massey. While they were performing in Los Angeles, future Go-Go&#x27;s band mate, Charlotte Caffey, caught a performance of Edie and the Incredible Eggs. Caffey was impressed by Edie&#x27;s distinctive vocals and Schock&#x27;s hard-pounding drums. After her tour with Edie and the Incredible Eggs, Schock told her family she wanted to relocate to Los Angeles, California. Her parents were worried about her moving so far away, but eventually consented and her father helped her convert his truck for the move. 

Upon moving to Los Angeles, one of the first bands Schock saw perform was The Go-Go&#x27;s. She later met future Go-Go&#x27;s band mates at a party at a time when they were looking for a drummer. Soon after, in 1979, she joined The Go-Go&#x27;s, replacing Elissa Bello as the band&#x27;s drummer. In the band&#x27;s early days, Schock worked at a grocery store, where she would steal steaks to cook for her band mates. 

Schock recorded and toured steadily with The Go-Go&#x27;s until the group disbanded in 1985 and reformed a few years later.
The Go-Go&#x27;s announced their breakup in 1985, but played reunion gigs in 1990 and 1994.

In 1985, Schock was occasionally seen on television appearances as the drummer of the Norwegian band a-ha. However, this was just for promo on television, as she was never part of the official band. In 1987, Schock and Vance DeGeneres formed the band House of Schock. In 1997, she joined Dominique Davalos and Kathy Valentine&#x27;s band The Delphines.

In 1997, Schock sued the other members of The Go-Go&#x27;s for unpaid royalties. She demanded $100,000 in compensation and an accounting, claiming that she had not received any income from the band since 1986.

Schock co-wrote, with Ted Bruner and Trey Vittetoe, the title track of Miley Cyrus&#x27; 2008 album, &quot;Breakout&quot;. The song was previously recorded by Katy Perry. She also co-wrote &quot;Kiss &amp; Tell,&quot; the b-side of &quot;Naturally&quot;, recorded in 2009 by Selena Gomez and featured on her album &quot;Kiss &amp; Tell&quot;.

Alison Ellwood&#x27;s documentary about the band, &quot;The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, was released in 2020. Schock later stated that &quot;99% of the photos in Alison’s documentary are [hers]&quot;. The Go-Go&#x27;s announced an 11-date reunion tour scheduled to begin in June 2020; however, in May of that year the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2021, it was announced that The Go-Go&#x27;s would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band confirmed plans for a UK tour with Billy Idol that would start in June 2022, but it was later cancelled because of Idol&#x27;s illness. The Go-Go&#x27;s broke up shortly thereafter.

Schock&#x27;s book, &quot;Made in Hollywood: All Access With the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, was published in 2021. The book consists of her photos of the Go-Go&#x27;s and Schock&#x27;s own writing. It also features writing from Jodie Foster, Paul Reubens, Martha Quinn, Kate Pierson, Dave Stewart, and members of the band, including a foreword from Kathy Valentine.

== Personal life ==
In 1984, Schock was diagnosed with a hole in her heart.She had open-heart surgery before the tour supporting the band&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Talk Show&quot;. In the 2020 documentary, &quot;The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, Schock stated that she and Jane Wiedlin &quot;were girlfriends for a while&quot; until Wiedlin ended things.

<text>Kazumura Cave is a lava tube and has been surveyed at 40.7 miles (65.5 km) long and 3,614 feet (1,102 m) deep making it the longest and deepest lava tube in the world. The cave is located on the island of Hawaiʻi on the eastern slope of Kīlauea. Kīlauea is the most recently active volcano on the Big Island. The ʻAilāʻau lava flow that contains Kazumura Cave originated from the Kīlauea Iki Crater about 500 years ago.

==History==
One of the earliest documentations of Kazumura Cave was in 1966 when one of its entrances was designated as a fallout shelter. By the early 1970s, the cave had entered into the awareness of the caving community when Francis Howarth discovered new troglobitic moth species, &quot;Schrankia howarthi&quot;. Later in 1981, a British expedition ended up surveying 7.27 miles (11.7 km) of the cave and it was then recognized as one of the world&#x27;s longest lava tubes.

By 1993, a single year of extensive surveying established that it was the longest in the world. Originally Kazumura was two separate caves known as Upper Kazumura and Old Kazumura. Kevin Allred and Mike Meyer connected the two caves after seeing a small connection between the two caves and enlarging it to permit entry. More connections were made later at Paradise Park Cave when it was connected to Kazumura through a breakdown pile. Later, a culvert was installed to keep the passage stable. Sexton Cave was discovered nearby; its passage ended where Kazumura&#x27;s began. After some digging in black lava rock, Kevin and Mike Shambaugh got close to connecting these two caves. Eventually Shambaugh connected them after continuous digging. Kevin and Carlene Allred then surveyed the combined caves to a total of 29.32 miles (47.19 km), which made it the longest lava tube in the world.

Meanwhile, the next cave upslope was Ola&#x27;a Cave which was nearly connected to Sexton but was sealed off by more black lava rock. The cave would later be connected to Kazumura by Kevin and Shambaugh in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHOWCAVES /&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller caves near Old Kazumura were also connected, including Hawaiian Acres # 1, Fern&#x27;s, and Doc Bellou Caves. The latter two are connected by a tight crawlway.

Kevin and Carlene Allred recorded their work in the Kazumura Cave Atlas: a complete map of all passages of Kazumura Cave. It lists a total of 40.77 miles (65.61 km) for the system as of 2002, with a linear extent of 20.05 miles (32.23 km).

The Kazumura Cave Atlas lists 101 entrances, all on private property. Under current Hawaiian laws, landowners must be asked before entering any lava tubes on their property. At least one landowner runs paid adventure tours through his section of the cave as of 2016.

== Ecology ==
Kazumura Cave hosts a number of endemic cave arthropods found only on the island of Hawai&#x27;i, including a blind planthopper which feeds on the roots of native ʻōhiʻa trees (Oliarus polyphemus), a cave cricket (Caconemobius varius), a millipede, two species of Schrankia moths, an earwig, several species of spiders, and a unique cave-adapted water treader (Cavaticovelia aaa). These arthropods likely use a network of interconnected cooling cracks in the surrounding pahoehoe lava as their primary habitat and sometimes disperse into the cave.

<doc id="1328375" wikidata="Q906497" url="?curid=1328375" title="Stephen Moulton Babcock">
<text>Stephen Moulton Babcock (22 October 1843 – 2 July 1931) was an American agricultural chemist. He is best known for developing the Babcock test, used to determine butterfat content in milk and cheese processing, and for the single-grain experiment that led to the development of nutritional science as a recognized discipline.

==Early life and career==
Babcock was born on a farm in Bridgewater, New York to Peleg and Cornelia Babcock. He earned a B.A. from Tufts College in 1866 and attended Cornell University from 1872 to 1875, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree before studying organic chemistry at the University of Göttingen, Germany, from which he received a Ph.D. in 1879. Upon his return to the United States in 1881, Babcock took up the role of an agricultural chemist at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, where his first assignment was to determine the proper feed ratios of carbohydrate, fat, and protein using chemical analysis of cow excrement. He determined that the excrement&#x27;s chemical composition was similar to that of the feed, the only major exception being the ash content. These results were tested and retested, and his results were similar to German studies done earlier. This led Babcock to wonder what would happen if cattle were fed a single grain (barley, corn, or wheat), though that test would not be carried out for nearly twenty-five years.

==University of Wisconsin–Madison==
In 1888, Babcock accepted a position at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Agricultural Experiment Station (UWAES) as chair of the agricultural chemistry department. He immediately petitioned Dean of Agriculture William Henry, then station director, to carry out the &quot;single-grain experiment&quot;, but Henry refused. In 1890, he developed the Babcock test which determines the butterfat content of milk. He then worked with bacteriologist Harry Luman Russell in developing the cold-curing process for ripening cheese (1897). The Babcock test set the worldwide standard for butterfat determination of milk, while the cold-curing process enabled Wisconsin to become the leading cheese producer in the United States.

==&quot;Single-grain experiment&quot;==
Babcock continued pressing William Henry to perform the &quot;single-grain experiment&quot; and even unsuccessfully approached the UWAES animal husbandry chair J. A. Craig. Craig was replaced in 1897 by W. L. Carlyle, who was more receptive to Babcock&#x27;s proposal. He initially tried a salt experiment with eight dairy cows as a matter of taste preference, while eight other cows received no salt. After one of the eight cows that did not receive salt died, Carlyle discontinued the experiment, and all of the remaining cows were given salt in order to restore their health.

William Henry, who became dean of agriculture in 1901, finally gave Babcock permission to perform the single-grain experiment. Carlyle approved the experiment with only two cows. One cow was fed corn, while the other was fed rolled oats and straw with the expectation that the experiment would last one year. Three months into the trial, the oat-fed cow died, and Carlyle halted the experiment to save the other cow&#x27;s life. The result was not published, mainly because Babcock had not recorded how much of each grain the cows had consumed.

In 1906, a chemist from the University of Michigan, Edwin B. Hart (1874-1953), was hired by Babcock. Hart had previously worked at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station and had studied physiological chemistry under Albrecht Kossel in Germany. Both worked with George C. Humphrey, who replaced Carlyle as animal husbandry professor, to plan a long-term feeding plan using a chemically balanced diet of carbohydrates, fat, and protein instead of single-plant rations as had been tried in Babcock&#x27;s earlier experiment. The &quot;single-grain experiment&quot; was thus born in 1907.

From May 1907 to 1911, the experiment was carried out with Hart as director, Babcock providing the ideas, and Humphrey overseeing the welfare of the cows during the experiment. Elmer McCollum, an organic chemist from Connecticut, was hired by Hart to analyze the grain rations and the cow excrement. The experiment called for four groups of four heifer calves each, and three groups were raised and two pregnancies were carried to term during the experiment. The first group ate only wheat, the second group ate only bran, the third group ate only corn, and the last group ate a mixture of the other three.

In 1908, it was shown that the corn-fed animals were the most healthy of the group, while the wheat-fed groups were the least healthy. All four groups bred during that year, with the corn-fed calves being the healthiest, while the wheat and mixed-fed calves were stillborn or later died. Similar results were found in 1909. In 1910, the corn-fed cows had their diets switched to wheat and the non-corn-fed cows were fed corn. This produced unhealthy calves for the formerly corn-fed cows while the remaining cows produced healthy calves. When the 1909 formulas were reintroduced to the respective cows in 1911, the gestation results of 1909 reoccurred. These results were published in 1911. Similar results had been determined in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in 1901, in Poland in 1910, and in England in 1906 (though the English results were not published until 1912).

This experiment helped the development of nutrition as a science.

==Legacy==

Babcock died in 1931, in Madison, Wisconsin, from a heart attack suffered during a heat wave. His estate was left to the University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Agriculture. By a decision of the deans, a housing cooperative for male students studying agriculture was established in the Babcock home and named in his honor. Babcock House is the oldest continuously operating student housing cooperative in Wisconsin and is now open to male and female students of any course of study.

In 1948, the Institute of Food Technologists created the Stephen M. Babcock Award (now the Babcock-Hart Award) in honor of Babcock&#x27;s achievements. Additionally, the Food Science Department building at the University of Wisconsin in Madison was named in Babcock&#x27;s honor in 1952. The Institute of International Dairy Research and Development at Wisconsin was also named in Babcock&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="1328384" wikidata="Q382715" url="?curid=1328384" title="Harold Hughes">
<text>Harold Everett Hughes (February 10, 1922 – October 23, 1996) was an American politician who served as the 36th Governor of Iowa from 1963 until 1969, and a United States senator from Iowa from 1969 until 1975. He began his political career as a Republican but changed his affiliation to the Democratic Party in 1962.

==Early years==
Hughes was born in 1922 in Ida Grove, Iowa. He married Eva Mercer in August 1941. In 1942, his brother Jesse was killed in a car accident at the age of 23. Hughes and his wife had a daughter in 1942, and shortly afterward Hughes was drafted. He served in the U.S. Army, fighting in the North African campaign, and was court-martialed for assaulting an officer. The trial resulted in Hughes&#x27; being sent to fight in Sicily in 1943. He became ill and another soldier took his place on a landing craft at Anzio. The craft exploded, killing his replacement and many others.

Hughes&#x27; interest in politics was stirred by involvement in the trucking industry. He became a manager of a local trucking business, and then began organizing independent truckers. Hughes started the Iowa Better Trucking Bureau and was eventually elected to the State Commerce Commission board, which he served from 1958 to 1962, including a term as its chairman.

In 1952, after years as an alcoholic, Hughes attempted suicide. He described in his book how he climbed into a bathtub (to make the mess easier to clean up) with a shotgun, ready to pull the trigger, when he cried out to God for help. He had a spiritual experience that changed the course of his life. He began to pray and study the Bible diligently, and even considered a career in the ministry. He also embraced the Alcoholics Anonymous program of recovery and started an AA group in Ida Grove, Iowa, in 1955.

Hughes grew up as a Republican in a heavily Republican area, but was persuaded to switch parties. His service on the State Commerce Commission also brought him in contact with the Interstate Commerce Commission and national politics. He then ran for Governor of Iowa on the Democratic ticket and defeated incumbent Republican Norman Erbe in 1962.

A major issue in the campaign was legalization of liquor-by-the-drink. Iowa allowed only beer to be consumed over the bar. Liquor and wine could be purchased only in state liquor stores and private clubs. Hughes became a proponent of liquor-by-the-drink. A short time after he was elected, the state adopted a new system of alcohol control.

==Governor of Iowa==
Hughes served as governor from 1963 to 1969. During this time, he continued to reach out, as a Christian and an alcoholic in recovery, to people still suffering. He established a treatment program in the state and was an effective spokesman for a more enlightened view of the role of alcohol in society. The new treatment program was viewed as an alternative to the state mental hospitals. Hughes wrote that the goal was to reach alcoholics &quot;before they reach rock bottom.&quot;

A death penalty opponent, Hughes reached out to President John F. Kennedy to request he commute the death sentence of Victor Feguer, who had been convicted on federal murder charges. The President was the only one who could commute the sentence, but Kennedy thought the crime was so brutal that he denied the request.

Meanwhile, Hughes&#x27;s political career continued to gain strength. He made a speech seconding the nomination of Lyndon B. Johnson at the 1964 Democratic convention—a decision he would eventually regret—and gained national recognition as a liberal governor as well as a promising national figure in the Democratic Party. Trade missions abroad, and a tour of Vietnam with other governors, provided him with foreign policy experience.

In his 1964 bid for reelection as governor, Hughes&#x27;s opponent, Evan Hultman, called attention to Hughes&#x27;s brief relapse into alcoholism in 1954. In a debate, Hultman charged that Hughes&#x27;s failure to acknowledge the relapse publicly showed that Hughes lacked integrity. Hughes responded, &quot;I am an alcoholic and will be until the day I die... But with God&#x27;s help I&#x27;ll never touch a drop of alcohol again. Now, can we talk about the issues of this campaign?&quot; According to the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;&#x27;, &quot;The reaction of the crowd was immediate and nearly unanimous.&quot; Later, the &quot;Register&quot; editorialized, &quot;In our opinion, any man or woman who wins that battle and successfully puts the pieces of his or her life back together again deserves commendation, not censure.&quot; Hughes won by a landslide.

In 1966, Iowa, like other states, experienced Democratic losses, Hughes, however was reelected by 99,741 votes. It was at that time that his friendship with Robert F. Kennedy started, and it was Kennedy who encouraged him to run for a Senate seat. The next years were difficult, in the wake of the 1968 assassinations of Kennedy and of Martin Luther King Jr., racial unrest in Iowa, and his increasing disappointment with American policy in Vietnam and the leadership of the Johnson administration.

==U.S. Senator from Iowa==

=== 1968 campaign ===
At the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Hughes was giving a nominating speech for anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy when violent demonstrations erupted on the streets of Chicago. In the general election in 1968, Hughes was a heavy favorite to defeat Republican candidate David Stanley, a Muscatine, Iowa state senator for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Bourke Hickenlooper of Cedar Rapids. Hughes won but by only 6,415 votes

=== Leader on alcoholism and narcotics addiction ===
As a U.S. Senator, Hughes persuaded the chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Labor and Public Welfare Committee to establish a Special Sub-committee on Alcoholism and Narcotics, chaired by Hughes himself. This subcommittee, which gave unprecedented attention to the subject, held public hearings on July 23–25, 1969. A number of people in recovery testified, including Academy Award-winning actress Mercedes McCambridge, National Council on Alcoholism founder Marty Mann, and AA co-founder Bill W. In his autobiography, &quot;The Man from Ida Grove: A Senator&#x27;s Personal Story&quot;, Hughes writes that he asked a dozen other well-known people in recovery to present public testimony, but all declined. The hearings were considered by some in AA a threat to anonymity and sobriety.

Hughes also talked about the need for treatment of drug addiction. He stated that &quot;treatment is virtually nonexistent because addiction is not recognized as an illness.&quot; The hearings, and subsequent events related to alcoholism and addiction, were not given much press attention because the press was more interested in the Vietnam War, poverty, and other critical issues. Legislation creating the National Institute on Drug Abuse was not passed until 1974.

The goal of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, considered a &quot;major milestone&quot; in the nation&#x27;s efforts to deal with alcohol abuse and alcoholism, was &quot;to help millions of alcoholics recover and save thousands of lives on highways, reduce crime, decrease the welfare rolls, and cut down the appalling economic waste from alcoholism.&quot;

=== Touted as a presidential &quot;dark horse&quot; ===
In early 1970, Hughes began to get press recognition as a &quot;dark horse candidate&quot; for the 1972 presidential election. Columnist David Broder described him as &quot;a very dark horse, but the only Democrat around who excites the kind of personal enthusiasm the Kennedys used to generate.&quot;
In 1971, Hughes denounced Nixon&#x27;s secret wiretapping, done through the FBI.

He seemed to observers to be an almost reluctant candidate, though, and a bit too much of a &quot;mystic&quot; for the Washington press corps. Columnist Mary McGrory wrote of him: &quot;He hates small talk, he likes a heavy rap. He talks about religion, and about drugs and alcohol. He hated being trotted out to cajole financiers wanting to look him over before opening the checkbook. His staff had to prod him to call party chairmen. Hughes preferred a session with the kids at the local treatment centers.&quot; The Washington establishment was not too surprised when he dropped out of the race.

According to Hunter S. Thompson, Gary Hart suggested after the &#x27;72 campaign that Hughes might have been the only Democratic candidate who could have defeated Nixon.

=== Decision not to seek re-election ===
On September 5, 1973, Hughes announced that, after a long period of soul-searching, he would retire from the Senate when his term was completed. He said that, for &quot;profoundly personal religious reasons&quot; he would seek &quot;a new kind of challenge and spiritual opportunity,&quot; and would &quot;continue efforts in alcoholism and drug treatment fields, working for social causes and world peace.&quot; He said: &quot;Rightly or wrongly, I believe that I can move more people through a spiritual approach more effectively than I have been able to achieve through the political approach.&quot;

In 1974, his last full year in the Senate, he succeeded in passing legislation that extended and expanded the original 1970 act. He was invited to the signing of the bill by President Nixon, but &quot;couldn&#x27;t bring myself to attend, since his administration had fought it every inch of the way.&quot; Democratic Congressman John Culver defeated Stanley to succeed Hughes in 1974.

==Post-Senate years and retirement==
After he left the Senate, Hughes devoted himself to lay religious work for two foundations based in Washington and also founded a religious retreat at Cedar Point Farms in Maryland (owned by Hughes himself). He had been active in prayer groups while serving in the Senate, and the last few chapters of his autobiography gave this aspect of his life special prominence. Hughes partnered with former Nixon Aide Charles Colson in his religious work, and even portrayed himself in the 1978 motion picture, &quot;Born Again&quot;, starring Dean Jones as Colson. He also remained a strong advocate for services to chemically dependent people. For some years during the 1970s, Hughes served as the president of the Fellowship Foundation (also known informally in Washington as The Family). Hughes hosted prayer meetings for The Family at his Cedar Point Farms facility, even hosting President Jimmy Carter there in 1978.
After his retirement, Hughes served as a consultant to the Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee for a year. He then started the Harold Hughes foundation and opened the Harold Hughes Center to combat alcoholism. After some time in Iowa, Hughes considered running for governor in 1982 but did not. Hughes moved to a retirement community in Glendale, Arizona, where he died. His remains were returned to Iowa and buried in the Ida Grove cemetery in Ida Grove, Iowa.

Hughes and his first wife, whom he married in 1941, divorced in 1987. Six weeks after the divorce, he married his former secretary, Julie Holm, with whom he had been living with for a year after he was separated from his soon to be ex-wife. Hughes moved to Arizona and lived in a single-family home with his second wife, while his first wife lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Iowa. Hughes and his former wife got into bitter alimony and child support battles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hughes&#x27; former wife claimed that he had completely cut off her annuities and health insurance, while Hughes claimed that he himself did not have money. Ultimately, Hughes was ordered to pay back over $10,000 to his former wife, which she successfully collected from his estate. Because of the Harold Hughes Center&#x27;s declining fortunes, Hughes owed approximately $80,000 to creditors in the 1990s. Combined with increasing medical expenses and the court-ordered alimony payments, Hughes&#x27; debts increased dramatically during his last years, and he died virtually bankrupt. Hughes&#x27; former wife, who lived in Iowa, died in 2017.

<doc id="1328386" wikidata="Q6377326" url="?curid=1328386" title="Kathy Valentine">
<text>Kathryn Valentine (born January 7, 1959) is an American musician who is the bassist for the rock band the Go-Go&#x27;s. She has maintained a career in music through songwriting, recording, performing and touring as well as additional academic and creative pursuits. Valentine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in October 2021 as a member of The Go-Go&#x27;s.

==Early life==
Valentine was born on January 7, 1959, in Austin, Texas, an only child who was raised by her single mother, an English expatriate. In 9th grade she began playing guitar after she moved from public school to an alternative school called Greenbriar. In 1973, while visiting England with her mother, she happened to see Suzi Quatro on &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot;, and said it &quot;blew her mind&quot;. It had never occurred to her that a woman could be a rock star.

She returned to Austin, got an electric guitar and amp, and began looking for bandmates. She credits the Austin music scene for her diverse musical roots, in particular Jimmie Vaughan and The Fabulous Thunderbirds, as well as Texas icon Doug Sahm who let her onstage to sit in with his band on the Chuck Berry song &quot;Carol&quot;.

In 1975, on a subsequent family visit to London with her mother, she answered an ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and joined the fledgling Girlschool. She missed a gig due to illness and was replaced by Kelly Johnson, with whom she would later work. Inspired by the punk scene and bands like the Ramones and Blondie, Valentine returned to Austin and formed the punk band the Violators, alongside Carla Olson, Jesse Sublett and Marilyn Dean. The band played at Raul&#x27;s, Austin&#x27;s first punk club, in February 1978.

In late 1978, aged 19, Valentine moved to Los Angeles and co-founded the Textones with Carla Olson. The Textones released two singles, including an unreleased Tom Petty song, before Valentine left the band in 1980. During her time in the Textones, Phil Seymour recorded &quot;We Don&#x27;t Get Along&quot;, a song she&#x27;d written. The Go-Go&#x27;s would later record this song as well as other songs she&#x27;d written during the Textones period, such as &quot;Vacation&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop The World&quot;.

==Career==
===The Go-Go&#x27;s (1980–1985)===
Valentine was asked to play bass, an instrument that she had not played extensively, as a substitute for the Go-Go&#x27;s bass player Margot Olavarria, who had been ill and the band decided needed to be replaced. She says she learned their songs over four days and rehearsed with them twice before hitting the stage on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1980 at Whisky a Go Go. Valentine was asked to remain as a permanent member shortly thereafter. The Go-Go&#x27;s were signed to I.R.S. Records in March 1981. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the World&quot; was recorded for the Go-Go&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot;.

The second album featured Valentine&#x27;s previous Textones song &quot;Vacation&quot; as the title track and first single, after re-working the arrangement with Go-Gos&#x27; guitarist Charlotte Caffey. On the Go-Gos&#x27; third LP, &quot;Talk Show&quot;, Valentine also co-wrote with Caffey the hit single &quot;Head over Heels,&quot; and played lead guitar on several songs, including the single &quot;Turn To You&quot;, album cuts &quot;You Thought&quot;, &quot;Beneath The Blue Sky&quot;, and &quot;Good For Gone&quot;.

The band struggled with internal difficulties during the recording of &quot;Talk Show&quot;, and tried to stay together after the departure of rhythm guitarist Jane Wiedlin. Valentine moved to lead guitar duties, and Paula Jean Brown was hired to play bass. The Go-Go&#x27;s broke up in May 1985.

===Post Go-Go&#x27;s (1985–1990) and Go-Go&#x27;s reunion===
After the break up, Valentine said that she felt lost and that her identity had become absorbed into being a Go-Go. Returning to her rock roots, she formed the World&#x27;s Cutest Killers, a line up she thought would be successful, featuring former Girlschool guitarist Kelly Johnson, her old friend Jesse Sublett on bass, drummer (future A&amp;R man) Craig Aaronson, and keyboardist Jebin Bruni. The group attracted the attention of producer Mike Chapman and recorded demos, which were scrapped, and the band split up. Several other bands and line ups went nowhere, and Valentine returned to school. In 1990, the Go-Go&#x27;s reunited for concerts and a CD of greatest hits, but split again soon after.

===The BlueBonnets, The Delphines, and Go-Go&#x27;s second reunion (1992–2013)===
In 1992, Valentine began her longest collaboration and partnership with singer and bassist Dominique Davalos. They formed the BlueBonnets, a blues-based group. With high-profile guests sitting in with the band, club goers lining up to see them, and performances at celebrity wedding receptions and parties, record company scouts took notice but the band went through line up changes — many fans thought the addition of Pinky Turzo on lead vocals was the group&#x27;s pinnacle, although attempts to capture the magic in the studio proved fruitless — and eventually morphed into the Valentine/Davalos band The Delphines early in 1995.

The Go-Go&#x27;s began working together again, with Valentine co-writing &quot;The Whole World Lost Its Head&quot; on &quot;Return To The Valley of The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, a song which became the band&#x27;s highest charting U.K. single. The band released a new CD &quot;God Bless The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot; in 2001, toured extensively for many years, and appeared in a popular DVD live concert, &quot;The Go-Go&#x27;s Live In Central Park&quot;. Determined not to let the Go-Go&#x27;s define her this time around, Valentine kept The Delphines going, and the band released two albums, &quot;The Delphines&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cosmic Speed&quot; (2001).

===&quot;Light Years&quot; (2005)===
In 2005, Valentine released a solo recording, &quot;Light Years&quot;, that she co-produced, wrote, arranged and performed the guitar and vocal tracks. &quot;Light Years&quot; featured musician friends, including Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley, Guns and Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke, Lenny Kravitz, guitarist Craig Ross, and drummers Clem Burke and Pete Thomas. She began the record while pregnant in 2002 and wrote several songs with then husband, attorney and musician Steven Weisburd.

===Return to Austin, third Go-Go&#x27;s reunion and Hall of Fame induction (2006-present)===
In 2006, Valentine returned to her hometown to reside. She has been featured on the cover of the Fall 2010 issue of &quot;Texas Music&quot;, a February 2007 issue of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, and the February 2009 issue of &quot;Austin Woman&quot;.

In March 2014, at South by Southwest she was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame by members of Blondie (Debbie Harry, Chris Stein, and Clem Burke). She and Davalos re-formed The BlueBonnets with a Texas line up, including Austin guitarist Eve Monsees.

The band has released two albums, &quot;Boom Boom Boom Boom&quot; (2010) and &quot;Play Loud&quot; (2014), and were invited to open for The Waterboys American tour in Spring 2015. Their third album, &quot;Tonewrecker&quot;, was released on April 1, 2017. Valentine and Davalos also perform in the band &quot;Lady Band Johnson&quot; with front man Johnny Goudie.

On March 21, 2016, The Go-Go&#x27;s announced plans for a farewell tour. However Valentine would not be part of the lineup.

A number of her songs were featured in the 2018 debut of the Broadway musical, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, with a story suggested by Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; set to the songs of the Go-Go&#x27;s and Belinda Carlisle. As a result, Valentine rejoined the band to perform their first show together as a quintet in six years at New York&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom on January 31, 2018. In February 2018, posts on the group&#x27;s official Facebook page confirmed that Valentine had rejoined the band. A summer tour is planned for 2020.

The original version of her Textones song, &quot;Vacation&quot;, is the theme song of the Starz cable series &quot;Hightown&quot; which debuted May 2020, and was renewed for a second season.

In 2020 the group announced an 11-date reunion tour however the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, The Go-Go&#x27;s announced plans for a 2022 UK tour with Billy Idol that would start in June 2022.

Valentine and The Go-Go&#x27;s were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on October 30, 2021. The group celebrated their induction with a special show at the Whisky a Go Go in December 2021. The group however were forced to cancel other West Coast dates scheduled for early January 2022 due to a COVID-19 case involving someone with the tour.

==Other activities==
While working to complete her inter-disciplinary degree in English and Fine Arts, Valentine has also begun taking writing jobs and public speaking engagements. She was the keynote speaker at The American Heart Association&#x27;s Go Red For Women annual event, and for the MEOW Conference, where she also presented a Valor Award to her early inspiration Suzi Quatro.

In 2014, Rainbow Light Nutritional Systems presented Valentine as part of its Game Changers promotional campaign.

In 2013, she put together an all-female, all-star band for the Experience Music Project&#x27;s Women Who Rock Exhibit.

Valentine recruited underground influential musicians and Seattle-based singers to front the band and was musical director. She has also been hired to write music reviews for The Talkhouse, an online site devoted to music and music lovers. In 2016, Valentine was the featured speaker at Kids In A New Groove annual fundraiser. The same year, Valentine signed with U.T. Press to write a memoir.

The original Textones version of Valentine&#x27;s song &quot;Vacation&quot; is the theme song of the Starz series &quot;Hightown&quot;.

Valentine&#x27;s memoir, &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot;, was published by the University of Texas Press in March 2020. The book has received universal praise and was #1 on Amazon&#x27;s Rock Biography chart.

==Go-Go&#x27;s lawsuit==
A broken wrist led to Valentine being replaced on a 2012 summer tour. On March 8, 2013, the Go-Go&#x27;s official website said &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; had led to her departure. On May 24, 2013, she sued her former bandmates for &quot;breach of fiduciary duty and abuse of control...in an attempt to deprive [her] of her position and interest in the group, including her right to receive her full 20% share of the benefits and revenues generated by the group&#x27;s substantial reputation, fame, and goodwill.&quot; In early 2014, the lawsuit that Valentine brought against her former bandmates was settled out of court. Valentine rejoined the Go-Go&#x27;s in 2018 and toured with them in summer 2018.

==Personal life==
Valentine is divorced from Steven Weisburd, with whom she has a daughter. Valentine and Weisburd were partners in The Townsend, a bar and performance venue in downtown Austin from 2016 to 2020.

<doc id="1328394" wikidata="Q2471362" url="?curid=1328394" title="Peter Purves">
<text>Peter John Purves (; born 10 February 1939) is an English television presenter and actor. Beginning his career as an actor, he joined &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to play Steven Taylor, a companion of the First Doctor, which he played from 1965 until 1966. In 1967, he became a presenter on the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, where he remained for eleven years. He has continued to make regular television appearances, including coverage of the Crufts dog show.

==Early life==
Purves was born in New Longton, near Preston, Lancashire. His father was a tailor who also ran a hotel in Blackpool for a short period. He was educated at the independent Arnold School in Blackpool and in the sixth form at Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School for Boys for a year, where he took A-levels and gained a pass in mathematics. He originally planned to go into teaching, training at Alsager College of Education, but began to act with the Barrow-in-Furness Repertory Company instead.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
At 26 years old in 1965, Purves first appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the role of Morton Dill, an American tourist, in &quot;The Chase&quot; after being cast by director Richard Martin.

Purves then appeared later in the same story as space pilot Steven Taylor, and became well known to television audiences in that role, as one of the early time-travelling companions in the programme, when the Doctor was played by William Hartnell. He has provided DVD commentaries for many of the surviving &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes he appeared in and documents the making of each of his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories in his autobiography, &quot;Here&#x27;s One I Wrote Earlier&quot;. He was also a good friend of the actor Jon Pertwee, who played the Third Doctor.

Purves has said that he prefers the historical stories on the show, such as &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot; and &quot;The Myth Makers&quot;.

In 2007, he returned to the role of Steven Taylor in the audio drama &quot;Mother Russia&quot; and has portrayed him in several additional audio dramas in the years since.

In 2023, he reprised his role as Steven in the series &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;.

==&quot;Blue Peter&quot;==

After leaving &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Purves became a regular presenter on the children&#x27;s magazine programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 1967 to 1978. He co-presented &quot;Blue Peter&quot; first with John Noakes and Valerie Singleton, and then with Noakes and Lesley Judd, during the programme&#x27;s perceived golden age. After Noakes, Purves is the longest-serving male &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter.

Purves maintained his connection to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; throughout his time on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, often hosting special features on the programme and interviewing the actors. These included clips from episodes which are otherwise now lost, including &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, in which Purves himself had appeared.

Dogs have featured in Purves&#x27;s career since his &quot;Blue Peter&quot; days when he was given charge of one of the &quot;&quot;Blue Peter&quot; Pets&quot;, Petra, a German Shepherd cross. Purves also presented the spin-off &quot;Blue Peter Special Assignment&quot;.

==Later television appearances==

After leaving &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Purves presented &quot;Stopwatch&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Going Places&quot;, then had spells as the front man for darts events on the BBC and as presenter of the long-running BBC1 motorcycle trials series &quot;Kick Start&quot;.

Purves&#x27;s later TV career has included cameo appearances in episodes of the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and sitcom &quot;The Office&quot;. In &quot;The Office&quot; episode &quot;Training Day&quot; Purves played himself in a customer care training video that David Brent and his staff were being shown (Purves is in fact a qualified business trainer and a motivational speaker).

Purves has had a 40-year association with television coverage of major dog shows such as Crufts and his 2007 appearance as a judge on the reality TV programme &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;. He also writes for the dog press and regularly presents at dog award shows. Marking his 70th birthday, his 2009 autobiography &quot;Here&#x27;s One I Wrote Earlier&quot; was released at The Kennel Club.

==Theatre==
Purves has worked as a pantomime director and has directed over 30 pantomime productions. In December 2012, he portrayed Alderman Fitzwarren in Dick Whittington at Harpenden Public Halls: this was the first time he performed in pantomime since 1985. He is also an after-dinner speaker.

==Personal life==
Purves lived for a time in the Bilton area of Rugby, Warwickshire, and then Northamptonshire. He now lives in the Suffolk village of Sibton with his wife, the West End actress Kathryn Evans. He was previously married from 1962 to 1982 to a Leeds-born playwright, Gilly Fraser (actual name Gillian Emmett). In 2008, Valerie Singleton revealed she had enjoyed a &quot;brief fling&quot; with Purves when he was &quot;between marriages&quot;.

Purves is an atheist.

In December 2022 Purves received an honorary fellowship from the University of Central Lancashire. A university spokesman said his &quot;inspirational career&quot; had shown &quot;a significant contribution in services to television, in acting and presenting&quot;.

<text>Edgar Howard Wright (born 18 April 1974) is an English filmmaker. He is known for his fast-paced and kinetic, satirical genre films, which feature extensive utilisation of expressive popular music, Steadicam tracking shots, dolly zooms and a signature editing style that includes transitions, whip pans and wipes. He first made independent short films before making his first feature film &quot;A Fistful of Fingers&quot; in 1995. Wright created and directed the comedy series &quot;Asylum&quot; in 1996, written with David Walliams. After directing several other television shows, Wright directed the sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999–2001), which aired for two series and starred frequent collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

In 2004, Wright directed the zombie comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead,&quot; starring Pegg and Frost, the first film in Wright&#x27;s &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy. The film was co-written with Pegg—as were the next two entries in the trilogy, the buddy cop film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007) and the science fiction comedy &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013). In 2010, Wright co-wrote and directed the action comedy film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, an adaptation of the graphic novel series. Along with Joe Cornish and Steven Moffat, he adapted &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011) for Steven Spielberg. Wright and Cornish co-wrote the screenplay for the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Ant-Man&quot; in 2015, which Wright intended to direct but abandoned, citing creative differences. He has also written and directed the action film &quot;Baby Driver&quot; (2017), the documentary &quot;The Sparks Brothers,&quot; and the psychological horror film &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot; (both 2021).

==Early life and education ==
Edgar Howard Wright was born on 18 April 1974 in Poole, Dorset and grew up predominantly in Wells in Somerset. He has an older brother, Oscar, who is an artist. He attended The Blue School, Wells from 1985 to 1992, and is honoured by a plaque at the school. His school drama teacher, Peter Wild, later played a cameo role in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;.

Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, he directed many short films, first on a Super-8 camera that was a gift from a family member and later on a Video-8 camcorder that he won in a competition on the television-programme &quot;Going Live&quot;. These films were mostly comedic pastiches of popular genres, such as the super hero-inspired &quot;Carbolic Soap&quot; and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; tribute &quot;Dead Right&quot; (which was featured on the DVD release of &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;).

From 1992 to 1994, Wright attended the Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design (now Arts University Bournemouth) and received an ND in Audio-Visual Design.

In June 2018, Arts University Bournemouth awarded Wright an Honorary Fellowship. On receiving the award Wright said that he still thought very fondly of his time there.

==Career==
===1995–2002: Early works and &quot;Spaced&quot;===
Wright made his feature film debut in 1995 with a low budget, independent spoof western, &quot;A Fistful of Fingers&quot;, which was picked up for a limited theatrical release and broadcast on the satellite TV channel Sky Movies. Despite Wright&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the finished product, it caught the attention of comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who subsequently chose him as the director of their Paramount Comedy channel production &quot;Mash and Peas&quot;. During this time he also worked on BBC-programmes such as &quot;Is It Bill Bailey?&quot;, &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Merry-Go-Round&quot; and &quot;Sir Bernard&#x27;s Stately Homes&quot;. In an interview with journalist and author Robert K. Elder for &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;, Wright attributes his edgy and comedic style to his love for &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;.

I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by horror films and genre films. And horror films harboured a fascination for me and always have been something I&#x27;ve wanted to watch and wanted to make. Equally, I&#x27;m very fascinated by comedy. I suppose the reason that this film changed my life is that very early on in my film-watching experiences, I saw a film that was so sophisticated in its tone and what it managed to achieve.

In 1998 writer/actors Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes were in the early stages of developing their sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; for Channel 4 and thought of asking Wright to direct, having fondly remembered working with him on the 1996 Paramount comedy &quot;Asylum&quot;. Wright gave &quot;Spaced&quot; an unusual look for the sitcom genre, with dramatic camera angles and movement borrowed from the visual language of science fiction and horror films. Instead of shying away from these influences Wright makes an active effort to show his referencing, adding a &#x27;Homage-O-Meter&#x27; to all of his releases, a device that displays each directorial nod he has made during shooting. In 2002, he made appearances as a scientist and a technician named Eddie Yorque during both series of &quot;Look Around You&quot;, a BBC-programme created by a member of the &quot;Spaced&quot; cast, Peter Serafinowicz. He also made two brief appearances in &quot;Spaced&quot;, one in which he can be seen, along with other crew members on the series, lying asleep in Daisy Steiner&#x27;s squat as she prepares to leave for her new house. The other is a brief appearance during the montage in the episode &quot;Gone&quot; where Daisy describes to Tim what she thinks would be a fun night out for the two. Edgar is sitting on the tube (with a beard) next to Tim and Daisy.

===2003–2013: &quot;The Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy and &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs The World&quot;===

The critical success of &quot;Spaced&quot; paved the way for Wright and Pegg to move to the big screen with &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, a zombie comedy which mixed a &quot;Brit flick&quot; romantic comedy style with homages to the horror classics of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi. The film was a success critically and financially, and its rooting in American genre cinema helped to make it an international hit.

The pair planned a trilogy of British genre comedies which were connected not by narrative but by their shared traits and motifs. The trilogy was named &quot;The Three-Flavours-Cornetto-Trilogy&quot; by the pair due to a running joke about the British ice cream product Cornetto and its effectiveness as a hangover cure. Wright explained to Clark Collis in an interview for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;We put that joke in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; where Nick asks for a Cornetto first thing in the morning. When I was at college, it was my hangover cure—probably still &quot;is&quot; my hangover cure. Then we put it into &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; because we thought it would be a funny recurring thing. One journalist in the United Kingdom said, &#x27;Is this going to be your theme as a trilogy?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Yes, it&#x27;s like Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s Three Colours trilogy. This is the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.&#x27; It was just a joke that stuck.&quot; Collis observes that the films also feature &quot;a running gag involving garden fences.&quot;

The second instalment was the comedy action thriller &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;. Production started in March 2006 and the film was released in February 2007 in the United Kingdom and April 2007 in the United States. It revolves around Pegg&#x27;s character, Nicholas Angel, a police officer who is transferred from London to rural Sandford, where grisly events soon take place. In 2007, Wright also directed a fake trailer insert for Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, called &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;. It was a plotless trailer that mocked horror clichés, with lines such as, &quot;If you... are thinking... of going ... into... this... house... DON&#x27;T!&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; was released; its over-$85 million budget dwarfed the £8 million budget of &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;. The film, based on the graphic novel series &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot;, was co-written, co-produced and directed by Wright. It took in roughly half its budget in box office, in spite of its critical reception and praise from fellow directors such as Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarantino and Jason Reitman. In November 2011, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, and based on Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was released. Wright co-wrote the film with writing partner Joe Cornish and Steven Moffat. The film also co-starred Wright&#x27;s frequent collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The third instalment of the Cornetto trilogy, &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;, premiered in London on 10 July 2013. The film is about several friends who reunite when one decides to repeat a pub crawl they did 20 years earlier. They have to get to &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; pub without ending up in the gutter to do this, but some unusual powers are at work and what happens to them may determine what happens to humans as a species.

=== 2014–2017: &quot;Ant-Man&quot; and &quot;Baby Driver&quot; ===
Wright had been developing a live-action film based on the Marvel Comics superhero Ant-Man with Joe Cornish since 2006. However, on 23 May 2014, Wright and Marvel Studios issued a joint statement announcing that Wright would exit the movie due to creative differences. According to Wright, he had been hired as writer-director but became unhappy when Marvel wanted to write a new script. In 2017, he said: &quot;The most diplomatic answer is I wanted to make a Marvel movie but I don&#x27;t think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie ... having written all my other movies, that&#x27;s a tough thing to move forward. Suddenly becoming a director for hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really.&quot; He was replaced by Peyton Reed as director, with Adam McKay and star Paul Rudd rewriting the screenplay. He and Cornish received both screenplay and story credits, with Wright also credited as executive producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;AntMan/StoryCredit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Wright announced that his next film would be &quot;Baby Driver&quot;. Wright has described the film as &quot;kind of like a musical&quot;, and &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; described it as &quot;a collision of crime, action, music, and sound&quot;. The film stars Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Eiza González, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx. The film began production on 11 February 2016 in Atlanta, and was released on 28 June 2017.

=== 2018–present: &quot;The Sparks Brothers&quot; and &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot; ===
In June 2018, Edgar announced he would be making a documentary on the cult pop rock band Sparks. He had covered the band&#x27;s concert in London in May at the O2 Forum Kentish Town. This concert would be included in the documentary. The film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on 30 January 2021 and was theatrically released in North America on 18 June 2021, by Focus Features.

In January 2019, it was announced that his next film will be a horror thriller film set in London and inspired by films such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; and &quot;Repulsion&quot;. In February 2019, it was revealed that the title was &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot;, with Anya Taylor-Joy attached to star. In February, Matt Smith and Thomasin McKenzie joined the cast. Other confirmed crew members include co-screenwriter Krysty Wilson-Cairns, editor Paul Machliss (who edited four episodes of &quot;Spaced&quot; in 2001 and all of Wright&#x27;s films since &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;) and &quot;Baby Driver&quot; production designer Marcus Rowland. The film was scheduled to be released on 25 September 2020 but was pushed back to 29 October 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2020 it was announced that Wright had formed a production company with his longtime collaborators Nira Park, Joe Cornish and Rachel Prior, &quot;Complete Fiction&quot;. That same day, it was reported that the production company had signed a deal with Netflix to tackle adaptations of &quot;Lockwood &amp; Co.&quot;, &quot;The Murders of Molly Southbourne,&quot; and &quot;The City of Brass&quot;. The production company is also set to produce another Netflix original series, albeit one that is under wraps and has several feature films in development with Working Title Films.

In April 2022 Wright was appointed to the British Film Institute&#x27;s Board of Governors for a four-year term, saying he was &quot;excited to see what I can do to help promote their incredible efforts in curating, preserving, producing and educating&quot;. In 2023, Wright announced via Twitter that &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; would be returning as an anime adaptation with the film&#x27;s original actors as the voice cast. &quot;Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&quot; was released on 17 November 2023 for Netflix, with Wright as an executive producer.

In February 2021, Wright signed on to direct Paramount Pictures&#x27; new film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Running Man&quot;, which would also be a remake of the 1987 film version, starring Josh Brolin and Glen Powell. Wright and Michael Bacall planned to re-imagine the story for a new audience, with Bacall writing the screenplay.

==Personal life==

Wright has stated in &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot; that the film that most influenced him was John Landis&#x27;s &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. Wright also mentioned Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; as films that made him want to be a director. 

Wright began dating American actress Anna Kendrick in 2009, after they met while filming &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;. They split up in March 2013.

In December 2007, Wright began guest programming at Repertory theatre the New Beverly Cinema following a sold-out screening of his films. He curated a two-week series of his favourite films dubbed &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, hosting interviews with filmmakers and performers for each screening. The festival concluded with a double-bill of &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;. Wright returned for additional &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; events in January 2011 and December 2011, the third series consisting of films that had been recommended to Wright by friends Bill Hader, Daniel Waters, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Joss Whedon, John Landis and Joe Dante, but that he had never seen. Wright&#x27;s attempt to narrow the list based on public comment from visitors to his blog &quot;produced another thousand suggestions.&quot; In August 2013, Wright programmed an additional double-feature series at the theater, &quot;The World&#x27;s End is Nigh&quot;, consisting of 12 movies that he called &quot;stepping stones to our new movie&quot; &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;.

Wright has made cameos in every film by his friend Garth Jennings. Jennings made cameos in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;.

<doc id="1328414" wikidata="Q6396190" url="?curid=1328414" title="Kevin Drum">
<text>Kevin Drum (born October 19, 1958) is an American journalist. Drum initially rose to prominence through the popularity of his independent blog &quot;Calpundit&quot; (2003–2004). He later was invited to launch another blog, &quot;Political Animal&quot; (2004–2008), for the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;. He held a writing and blogging position at &quot;Mother Jones&quot; from 2008 to 2021, before returning to independence with his &quot;Jabberwocking&quot; blog.

==Early life and education==
Drum was born on October 19, 1958, in Long Beach, California. He graduated from Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, California, and then attended Caltech for two years before transferring to California State University, Long Beach, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1981. While at CSULB, he served as city editor of the university&#x27;s student run newspaper, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily 49er&quot;.

==Career==

=== Technology ===
After graduating from college, Drum worked at RadioShack for several years, and became a store manager in Costa Mesa, California, in 1983. He subsequently got a technical-writing job with a local technology company, becoming a product manager at Emulex. In 1992, he began working at Kofax Image Products, an Irvine, California-based supplier of application software and image processing products. In 2000 he was promoted from the position of VP for Marketing, becoming the general manager of the Ascent Software Business Unit within Kofax. In 2001, he moved to newly created position with Dicom New Ventures, the business development arm of the Dicom Group, Kofax&#x27;s parent company. He quit in 2002 to become a marketing consultant; he gave that up in 2004 to concentrate full-time on writing.

=== Blogging ===
Drum&#x27;s blogging started in 2003, with his independent blog &quot;Calpundit.&quot; On a Friday in March, he posted a photo of his cat Inkblot as an antidote to stressful politics, thus inventing Friday cat blogging, a practice that was soon adopted by many blogs. The &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;, which wanted a blog, hired Drum in 2004 to launch &quot;Political Animal&quot;. Drum defended Hillary Clinton during her email controversy, stating that her actions were &quot;non-scandalous&quot;, and that she is &quot;honest to a fault when discussing policy&quot;.

====Iraq war====
Drum supported the 2003 Iraq War in its early stages. Just before the United States launched its attack, he changed his mind. He said, &quot;Before the war started I switched to opposition on practical grounds (i.e., that George W. Bush&#x27;s approach was incapable of accomplishing the goals it was meant to accomplish). Since then, I&#x27;ve pretty much come to the conclusion that, in fact, I should have opposed it all along on philosophical grounds: namely that it was a fundamentally flawed concept and had no chance of working even if it had been competently executed.&quot;

==== Lead and crime ====
Drum published a series of blogs with evidence that suggests a link between crime and environmental lead, including the link between the decline in American crime rates and the phaseout of leaded gasoline. The theory was popularized by public health researcher Jessica Reyes, as well as economist Rick Nevin. Drum&#x27;s thesis was criticized by Jim Manzi in January 2013; he has continued to document new evidence in support of the theory.
====Homelessness====
In a 2017 blog post for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; discussing then-recently published research on public perceptions of the homeless, Drum stated: &quot;The researchers solved their conundrum by suggesting that most people are disgusted by the homeless. No kidding. About half the homeless suffer from a mental illness and a third abuse either alcohol or drugs. You&#x27;d be crazy not to have a reflexive disgust of a population like that.&quot; Stephen Piston, one of the authors of the research, objected, stating that Drum&#x27;s article had &quot;profoundly misinterpreted&quot; their research. Pinson wrote: &quot;We argue that media coverage of homeless people often portrays them as unclean or diseased, which activates disgust among the general public. But [Drum] cites our research as proof that homeless people are inherently disgusting — which perpetuates the very problem in journalism our research was trying to solve.&quot;
==Personal==

In an interview with Norman Geras, Drum said that his intellectual heroes were Franklin D. Roosevelt, Isaac Newton, John Maynard Keynes, Edward R. Murrow and Charles Darwin. He also considers Benjamin Franklin his all-time favorite political hero. 

Drum lives in Irvine, California. He married in 1993; he and his wife, Marian, have no children. 

On October 24, 2014, Drum posted that he was undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma. On October 18, 2016, he updated readers that it had been two years since his diagnosis and he was &quot;still alive and kicking.&quot; In August 2018, he reported that his multiple myeloma remained well under control. In February 2025, he said that he pneumonia and a colon infection, and that his oncologist &quot;agreed my immune system was shot&quot;.

<doc id="1328433" wikidata="Q5195888" url="?curid=1328433" title="Curtis Sheppard">
<text>Curtis Sheppard (born about 1919) was an American boxer.

== Life ==
Sheppard was from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sheppard was a popular fighter during the 1930s and 1940s. His nickname was &quot;The Hatchetman.&quot; As was common during his era, no records of his birthdate, or his death date (if he is dead), are kept.

== Boxing career ==
Sheppard never received a world title shot. He was what in boxing is described as a &quot;journeyman.&quot; However, his career had many ups and downs, which made him an interesting boxer for fans to watch. The February 2005 issue of Ring magazine, described him as a &quot;gatekeeper,&quot; a fighter who stood in the way of other boxers seeking a title shot.

Sheppard began his career as a professional boxer on September 24, 1938, knocking out Larry White in the first round at Madison Square Garden. His first defeat was on November 1 of that year, against Danny Peal, by decision. Sheppard would win four fights in a row, including one against Herbie Katz, who had an immediate rematch, with Sheppard&#x27;s winning streak stopped at four, when Katz beat him by decision.

In his next fight, November 18, 1939, Sheppard met the future world Heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott. Sheppard lost that fight by an eight-round decision.

After another win and a loss, he met Tony Musto, another fighter of the era who is remembered for fighting many name boxers. Musto beat Sheppard by a ten-round decision, on July 1, 1940.

Sheppard won three and had one no contest in his next four bouts, including a win over Lee Q. Murray. His no-contest bout was against Elza Thompson, on April 17 of 1941, in Pittsburgh. But then he lost again, by decision to Willie Reddish, eleven days after his fight with Thompson.

In June of that year, he beat Q. Murray; then, on August 2, he lost by decision to future Hall of Famer Jimmy Bivins. Sheppard won five of his next seven fights, until on July 27, 1942, he lost to future world Light Heavyweight champion Joey Maxim, by a ten-round decision. He won two of his next four fights. The two fights he did not win during that span included another no-contest, this time against Hubert Hood, in six rounds.

Maxim was the world&#x27;s #1 challenger in the Light Heavyweight division at the time, and he only needed one more win to earn a world title shot. Because of this, Maxim&#x27;s management, thinking that Sheppard would be an easy opponent, scheduled a match between Sheppard and Maxim.

Sheppard temporarily spoiled Maxim&#x27;s plans, knocking him out in round one of their rematch, on March 10. This result, which would be the only knockout loss in Maxim&#x27;s career, was a surprise to Ring Magazine writers and many boxing fans. Needing to restore his image in order to fight for the world Light Heavyweight title, Maxim signed for an immediate rematch with Sheppard, which would be the third fight between the two boxers. Maxim prevailed this time around, by a ten-round decision.

While Maxim went on and became world champion, Sheppard continued to fight anyone, anytime. Only twenty-six days later, he went into the ring with a fighter who was 12-0 before their fight: Sheppard defeated Clint Conway by a ten-round decision on April 26.

Sheppard won only two of his next five fights, before embarking on a seven-fight win streak. The first three wins were first-round knockouts, including one over Conway, on December 12, 1943. On January 24, 1944, he had one of his best performances when he beat future challenger for the world heavyweight championship Gus Dorazio by a ten-round unanimous decision.

Sheppard&#x27;s win streak was stopped by Buddy Walker, who defeated Sheppard on February 6, by a ten-round decision.

Sheppard&#x27;s next fourteen fights were almost all against the elite of the Light Heavyweight division: He beat Buddy Walker by a knockout in eight rounds in a rematch. Then he beat Tony Shucco by knockout in five, before losing to Q. Murray and to future world champion Melio Bettina, both by ten-round decisions. Then he beat Alf Brown, Dan Merritt, and Buddy Walker, all except Walker by decision. Walker was knocked out in nine rounds. Then Sheppard was knocked out in seven rounds by Perk Daniels on April 9, 1945. This was followed by a points loss at the hands of Jimmy Bivins. Sheppard then had consecutive wins over Nate Bolden, Johnny Allen, and Perkins in a rematch, before facing Jersey Joe Walcott again, and Archie Moore. He dropped decisions to Walcott and Moore, but Moore would later claim that, of all of his opponents, which included Bob Satterfield, Ezzard Charles, Rocky Marciano, Floyd Patterson, and Muhammad Ali, it was Sheppard who hit him the hardest.

Sheppard would fight twenty three more times, winning fourteen and losing nine. He lost another fight to Moore, but &quot;the king of knockouts&quot; could never knock Sheppard out, as he had to settle for a second decision victory over Sheppard. Sheppard also lost to Bivins, Q. Murray and to Rusty Payne, each of them twice by decision, during that last 23-fight stretch. His second fight with Payne, on January 19, 1949, was his last professional boxing fight.

Sheppard compiled a record of 49 wins and 33 losses, with 2 no-contests, and 32 knockouts.

<text>Miroslav &quot;Ćiro&quot; Blažević (; 9 February 1935 – 8 February 2023) was a Bosnian-Croatian professional football manager and player.

A former right winger, his professional playing career spanned from 1954 to 1966, during which he played for Dinamo Zagreb, Lokomotiva Zagreb, Sarajevo, Rijeka and Swiss clubs Sion and Moutier.

As a manager, his most successful period was with the Croatia national team, which he led to the quarter-finals in the 1996 European Championship and won third place at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He also managed the following national teams: Switzerland, Iran, Bosnia and Herzegovina and China Olympic. Blažević also had successful spells at Vevey, Sion, Lausanne-Sport, Rijeka, Dinamo Zagreb, Grasshopper Zürich, Prishtina, Osijek, Varteks, Zagreb, Shanghai Shenhua and Sloboda Tuzla.

From 29 March 1993 to 23 February 1995, he was president of Dinamo Zagreb.

Blažević maintained a colourful public persona in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, where he was reverently known as &quot;trener svih trenera&quot; (the &quot;coach of all coaches&quot;).

==Early life==
Blažević was born to a Bosnian Croat family in Travnik, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina) on 9 February 1935. However, his parents did not register his birth until the next day, resulting in his official birthday being listed as 10 February. He was the youngest of eight children. In his teens he trained skiing.

== Playing career ==
Blažević began his youth career in local team NK Travnik, after which he moved to Zagreb and joined Dinamo Zagreb. His career as a player was, by his own admission, average; therefore, he began his coaching career at a relatively early age. As a player, he played for Dinamo Zagreb, Lokomotiva Zagreb, Rijeka, Sarajevo, and Sion. He ended his career at Moutier in 1966 after gaining promotion to LNA.

== Managerial career ==

=== Coaching in Switzerland ===
Blažević started as a coach where he ended his playing days in Switzerland. He first led FC Vevey (1968–71) then his former team FC Sion (1971–76), FC Lausanne-Sport (1976–79) and finally Switzerland&#x27;s national team (as interim coach for two games in 1976). With Sion he won the Swiss Cup with club as a player and as manager in 1974.

=== NK Rijeka ===
Blažević returned to Yugoslavia in 1979 to coach Rijeka. Rijeka finished tenth in the 1979–80 season. Although not a very good league season the club got to the quarter-finals of 1979–80 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup where they lost to Juventus. NK Rijeka&#x27;s best European placement.
Blažević also lost the 1979–80 Balkans Cup final to Studențesc București.

=== Success with Dinamo ===
Blažević took over Dinamo Zagreb on 11 December 1980, one of Yugoslavia&#x27;s big four clubs (the other three being Hajduk Split, Red Star Belgrade and Partizan) in 1980. After a mediocre first season, in which Dinamo finished fifth, Blažević became an instant club legend in the 1981–82, winning the first Yugoslav league title for the Zagreb outfit after a 24-year drought.

Next year, Dinamo won the Yugoslav Cup and led a long battle with Partizan and Hajduk Split in the league. Partizan became 1983 champions and Blažević left Dinamo for the first time.

=== Grasshopper and Prishtina ===
Blažević went back to Switzerland, winning the Swiss Championship with Grasshopper-Club Zurich in 1984. He advanced to the second round of 1984–85 European Cup where he lost to Juventus. After a less than expected second season Blažević left Grasshopper mid-season.

In 1985, Blažević was once again in Yugoslavia, this time as manager of Kosovo&#x27;s KF Prishtina. Under Blažević&#x27;s leadership Prishtina achieved First Division status. To this day he is noted as a club legend.

===Second stint at Dinamo, Nantes and PAOK===
In the same year he became Dinamo Zagreb&#x27;s coach for second time; during this period he failed to accomplish any significant results and therefore left again in 1988. His next team was FC Nantes of France; Blažević was there until 1990. After Nantes he spent a season in Greek club PAOK FC.

=== Croatia tenure ===
In the 1990s, with Croatia gaining independence, Blažević joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and became President Tuđman&#x27;s admirer and close friend. For the third time he became Dinamo (then named NK Croatia Zagreb) coach and president at the same time. He won the 1993 Croatian Championship and 1994 Croatian Cup, but then left his favorite club once more, citing his reasons for doing so as needing to focus on managing the Croatia national team.

Blažević was national team manager from 1994 on a part-time basis, but only a year later it became a full-time job as Croatia faced its first qualifying cycle for the European Championship. Croatia won the first place in qualifying group, sensationally ahead of Italy and directly entered Euro 96 in England. Blažević was about to gain some worldwide fame.

From January to June 1996 Blažević took up a position as an advisor at HNK Rijeka to help newly appointed coach Nenad Gračan save his former club from relegation.

Croatia passed group stage with wins against Turkey and current European champions Denmark and loss to Portugal, to face Germany in quarter-finals. Germany won 2–1 and eventually went on to win the event.

However, greatest things lay ahead, as Croatia was trying to qualify to the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. They won second place in the qualifying group behind Denmark and ousted Ukraine in a play-off for the tournament.

Blažević&#x27;s Croatia squad for the 1998 World Cup included the likes of Zvonimir Boban, Davor Šuker and Slaven Bilić. In France they created one of the greatest all-time World Cup sensations by winning the third place play-off. In the group stage, Croatia eliminated Japan and Jamaica, suffering a insignificant loss to Argentina in the final game. In the knockout stages they passed by Romania, winning 1–0 from a penalty kick. This prepared them for a quarter-final against Germany. Croatia beat Germany 3–0. However, Croatia were stopped by the hosts France in the semifinal. Blažević made a critical coaching decision in that semi-final as he failed to insert his most talented player Robert Prosinečki when the game was in the balance at 1–1. Instead he opted for Silvio Marić to replace the injured Boban after half-time and Croatia eventually lost the game 2–1. In the third-place match, Prosinečki started in Boban&#x27;s stead; his fielding proved fruitful as he scored the opening goal and assisted for the second, becoming man of the match. Croatia won against the Netherlands 2–1 to claim their first bronze.

The rest of his stint as Croatian manager was less successful. Croatia failed to qualify for Euro 2000, after finishing a third in a qualifying group behind FR Yugoslavia and Ireland. Blažević retained his position and began to build a new team, filled with younger players for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. However, after Croatia opened the qualifiers with two draws, he was forced to resign in autumn 2000.

=== Iran tenure and return to Croatia ===
Well known throughout the football world for his 1998 World Cup sensation, Blažević accepted an offer to lead the Iranian national team midway through the 2002 World Cup qualification process. Coming in ahead of the final qualifying round, he quickly developed a following among many of the Iranian fans. He kept the 3–5–2 formation that Iran had played with previously in the 96 Asian Cup, in which Iranian national team had won third place. He also introduced new players to Team Melli such as Rahman Rezaei, Javad Nekounam, and Ebrahim Mirzapour. Known as loudmouth and showman, Blažević stayed true to form by claiming he would hang himself from the goalposts if Iran failed to beat Ireland in the deciding qualification playoff for the 2002 World Cup. Ireland won 2–1 on aggregate, the defeat that marked the end of Blažević&#x27;s time in Iran as his assistant Branko Ivanković took over.

Blažević returned to Croatia, first saving NK Osijek from relegation and then again in Dinamo. In his fourth term as Dinamo coach, Blažević won the Croatian Championship in 2003, but left again same year after clashing with his long-time friend, Dinamo&#x27;s vice president Zdravko Mamić.

Blažević then led Slovenian NK Mura for few months before becoming the coach of Croatian side NK Varteks, a post he held until 31 May 2005. While at Varteks Zlatko Dalić was his assistant coach.

=== Short stint at Hajduk ===
Blažević controversially announced that he was going to coach Hajduk Split in 2005–06, having expressed his desire to coach the southern Croatian side for decades; many fans were skeptical due to his association with Hajduk Split&#x27;s derby rival Dinamo Zagreb. His arrival caused a great deal of media controversy; Hajduk Split fans had differing opinions, with a significant number seeing Blažević as a &quot;miracle worker&quot; that would help Hajduk Split regain its former glory.

Hajduk Split under Blažević&#x27;s leadership immediately got eliminated from European competitions, following an 8–0 aggregate defeat to Hungarian side Debreceni VSC; the 5–0 second leg loss is considered one of Hajduk Split&#x27;s worst losses in European competitions. This was followed by a series of losses and unsatisfying results at the beginning of the new league season, which finally forced Blažević to resign on 18 September. He was replaced by Igor Štimac, former Hajduk Split player and one of his main supporters in club administration.

=== Neuchâtel and NK Zagreb ===
In October 2005, he went back to Switzerland and coached Neuchâtel Xamax, replacing Alain Geiger in an attempt to save the club from relegation after they had won just one out of their first ten games of the season. Although Blažević achieved some notable victories with Neuchâtel against Swiss powerhouses FC Basel and FC Zurich, they finished the season in ninth place (in a ten-club league) and went to relegation playoff. They were eventually relegated after losing to another Swiss team Blažević had managed 35 years earlier, FC Sion, 3–0 on aggregate, and his tenure there ended in June 2006.

Once again, he returned to Croatia, this time to take over NK Zagreb. The club experienced a successful 2006–07 season which saw them finish third behind Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split and earned them a spot in Intertoto Cup 2007. However, in the following season the team made for an early exit, losing against their first Intertoto opponent Vllaznia on away goals. After Ivica Vrdoljak and Mario Mandžukić were transferred to city rivals Dinamo Zagreb at the beginning of the season, the team saw a string of mediocre results before finishing the season sixth. Immediately after the last game of the season, Blažević announced that his stint at NK Zagreb had come to an end by mutual consent between him and the club&#x27;s chairman.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
On 10 July 2008, Blažević was appointed head coach of Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team replacing Meho Kodro who had been dismissed two months earlier by the Bosnian FA (FSBiH) officials after reportedly refusing to take charge of the national team for a friendly against Iran. Since Kodro&#x27;s dismissal was seen by many fans as the latest in a series of problematic decisions by the much-maligned FA leadership, Blažević was thus, by proxy, not welcomed with open arms by certain sections of the public upon his arrival. With the national team in complete disarray and many players refusing to even answer call-ups by interim head coach Denijal Pirić, the appointment of Blažević was seen by many fans as FA&#x27;s desperate makeshift solution designed to appease the public in the wake of the ongoing two-month fiasco by bringing in a fairly established name. However, combining his carefully crafted showman public persona with some decent initial results on the pitch, Blažević quickly managed to charm most of the public into getting behind him. By his own admission, Blažević had already been close to getting the Bosnia-Herzegovina national team job six years earlier in 2002, but ended up not getting hired due to influential FSBiH executive Jusuf Pušina who considered Blažević unsuitable for the job because of the coach&#x27;s association with the Croatian wartime president Franjo Tuđman and his political party.

Staying true to all the staples of his coaching style from his previous places of employment, seventy-four-year-old Blažević quickly became the media favourite in Sarajevo. Always ready for a sound bite, he gave bombastic interviews, cheekily delivering bold statements and sweeping promises.

Bosnia under Blažević has qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier playoffs, playing a game against Portugal.
In Lisbon, Portugal, Bosnia lost 1–0, with a goal scored by Bruno Alves. In Zenica, Bosnia lost 1–0 against Portugal, with a goal scored by Raul Meireles. He was appointed manager to the Bosnia-Herzegovina team on 10 July 2008 and announced on 11 December 2009 his demission. His dismissal was preceded by criticism from Bosnian fans and journalists following Blažević&#x27;s attack on fan-favorite Zvjezdan Misimović, blaming him for the defeat against Portugal.

===Shanghai Shenhua===
After his recession as head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team he signed one day later on 12 December 2009 for Shanghai Shenhua. He finished the 2010 Chinese Super League season in a high third-place position qualifying for the AFC Champions League.

===China Olympic===
Blažević was appointed manager of the Chinese Olympic team on 30 November 2010. He resigned from his position in June 2011 after they failed to qualify to the 2012 Summer Olympics.

===Mes Kerman===
On 28 August 2011, Iran Pro League side Mes Kerman announced that they will sign a contract with Blažević to replace Samad Marfavi who had resigned two days earlier. On 31 August 2011, he returned to Iran after ten years and signed a one-year contract with Mes. On 9 September 2011, his side plays a match against Damash Gilan with a 1–1 draw. He started his career in the club successfully, but after the weeks, Mes returned to the relegation zone. He was sacked as club&#x27;s head coach on 14 February 2012 and was appointed technical director of the club.

===NK Zagreb===
In November 2012 he returned to NK Zagreb to help the club stay in the Prva HNL since they were in the relegation zone. In the beginning he started to have decent results like defeating Dinamo Zagreb on home ground but later his team started to decline in results. In December 2012 he almost left the club because he had a serious argument with the NK Zagreb chairman but he decided to stay. In May 2013 after NK Zagreb failed to secure a place in the Prva HNL and finished at the bottom of the league he announced his retirement from professional football at the end of the season.

===Sloboda Tuzla===
In January 2014, after refusing to take over the Croatian Second Football League club NK Solin, Blažević signed with the Bosnian Sloboda Tuzla playing in the second level Bosnian League. He took over the club while it was second on the league table and agreed to lead the club until the end of the season with the goal to reach the top level Bosnian league, He succeeded, with Sloboda winning 13 and drawing 1 of his 15 matches in charge to win the First League of FBiH with a record total of 71 points from their 30 league games in the season.

===Zadar===
On 2 September 2014, after Sloboda Tuzla, he was named the manager of Croatian First Football League club NK Zadar, but he parted ways with the club and finished his coaching career on 2 January 2015.

==Personal life and death==
Blažević married Zdenka Đorđević in 1962. The couple had three children and five grandchildren. Apart from Croatian, he also held Swiss citizenship.

Blažević died of prostate cancer in Zagreb on 8 February 2023, one day before his 88th birthday. He was buried at Zagreb&#x27;s Mirogoj Cemetery on 15 February.

==Political engagement==
Blažević was an admirer of Franjo Tuđman with whom he maintained a friendship as well. Blažević was also a member of the former Croatian president Tuđman&#x27;s conservative political party HDZ, but he publicly disagreed with his successor, the pro-European centrist politician Ivo Sanader. Because of this, Blažević left the party in 2000 shortly after Tuđman&#x27;s death, and then decided to run for President of Croatia as an independent candidate. Polls predicting the 2005 presidential election results usually gave him 1–2% of the vote. In the end he received 17,847 votes (0.80%) and was eliminated in the first round of the election.

Following the presidential elections debacle he quit politics, until he appeared once again four years later at the 2009 Zagreb local elections where he successfully ran as HDZ candidate for the city council. He claimed that prime minister Ivo Sanader had talked him into re-joining the party and running for office. He was at the time the oldest serving member of the Zagreb City Council and a member of the city board for naming streets and squares.

During World War II in Yugoslavia, Blažević&#x27;s two brothers, Anto and Joso, were members of the Ustaše, a fascist organization which ruled Croatia at the time. They were both killed in combat, aged seventeen. Speaking of his brothers, Blažević stated: &quot;I will never try to justify what they did, just like my father never tried to justify it. No normal person can support that which goes against humanity and civilised behaviour&quot;.

==Controversy==
===Robert Prosinečki===
At the end of the 1986–87 season at Dinamo Zagreb, Blažević sent eighteen-year-old prospect Robert Prosinečki away from the club, famously stating he &quot;would eat his coaching diploma if Prosinečki ever became a real [quality] football player&quot;. In the summer of 1987, Prosinečki moved to Yugoslav First League rivals Red Star Belgrade where he would go on to develop into one of the best players in Yugoslavia, winning three league titles, one cup trophy, and the European Cup title over the course of the following four years followed by a prominent transfer to Real Madrid and later Barcelona.

During his head coaching tenure with Croatia, Blažević frequently called up Prosinečki as the player became a crucial part of the team and the two seemingly mended fences.

Their ambivalent relationship took a turn for the worse again at Croatia&#x27;s 1998 FIFA World Cup semi-final match against France when Blažević did not let twenty-nine-year-old Prosinečki enter the contest until the 89th minute with Croatia down 1–2 after leading at the start of the second half and being tied until the 70th minute. Many sports journalists and supporters have claimed that Croatia would have reached the final had Prosinečki been given meaningful playing time in the match. Blažević has since claimed that Prosinečki &quot;feigned picking up an injury&quot; during training the day before the match. Prosinečki commented on the match in 2014 by saying: &quot;We are on good terms today, I appreciate him [Blažević] because he is unique. A man like him is born once in a lifetime, that&#x27;s for sure. He has his flaws just like we all have, but he has his virtues too. For some reason, he always had problems with me. Had I played the match against France for at least half an hour I believe I would have, at the very least, been able to do something [positive]. Maybe we could have been champions, I don&#x27;t know! I&#x27;m not angry, that would not be an accurate description of my feelings [on this]. Let&#x27;s just say that I think of it as his mistake that he has to deal with.&quot;

===Affaire VA-OM===
On 20 October 1995 at Geneva Airport, while waiting to board a flight to Brussels, Blažević was taken into custody by the French financial police on match-fixing and corruption accusations stemming from his time in Nantes. The arrest occurred as part of a wide-ranging football bribery scandal in France, known in the country as Affaire VA-OM, and was based on former Olympique Marseille director Jean-Pierre Bernès&#x27; July 1995 testimony, claiming that FC Nantes head coach Blažević took a ₣420,000 bribe to fix the Marseille vs. Nantes French Division 1 league match on 25 November 1989 that ended in a 0–0 draw.

Blažević was released from Luynes Prison on 6 November 1995 on a ₣100,000 bail and was not called up again after giving his statement.

===Referee incident===
After his first match as manager of Osijek on 6 March 2002 Blažević lost to Dinamo Zagreb. After the match he was accused of verbal abuse and assaulting the referee Ivan Novak.
Blažević was found guilty by disciplinary judge Krešimir Vlajčević and fined 6000kn and got a three-month suspension.

<text>Paris Joel Moore-Williams (born 8 April 1989), better known by his stage name P Money, is a British grime MC, rapper and songwriter from New Cross, South East London, who is also active in the drum and bass scene. He is best known for his live performances as well as for songs such as &quot;Slang Like This&quot;, &quot;Anthemic&quot; and &quot;Round the Clock&quot;. N.E was the founding member of Lewisham-based grime crew OGz and P Money released one album with the group entitled &quot;OGz Season Vol. 1&quot;.
He also appeared on the sixth edition of highly popular grime DVD &quot;Lord of the Mics&quot; (LOTM 6) in a grime clash (battle).

== Biography ==
P Money began his career within the crew Fatal Assassins along with MCs such as Little Dee, Blacks and Firmer D. During these times, P Money was known for his fast, skippy flow which created plenty of hype when attending pirate radio shows. He attended many classic studio sets such as those from the Hazardous Sessions series and also Fuck Radio volume 5. He gained a lot of positive attention with the massive single &quot;What Did He Say&quot;, which has since been released on vinyl and digital download, as well as the title being used as a slogan for a line of T-shirts. He is currently a member of the crew OGs and was involved with the collective&#x27;s first release, OG Season.

&quot;P Money Is Power&quot;, P Money&#x27;s debut album, received mixed reviews, with some people doubting the strength of some productions on the CD. However praise has been given to tracks such as the remix of &quot;What Did He Say&quot; and &quot;Sounds and Gimmicks&quot;.

&quot;Money Over Everyone&quot; is the second release from P Money which featured producers such as Maniac, Scratcha and Rude Kid.

In 2010, he collaborated with Kiss 100&#x27;s DJ Swerve, who remixed Marco Del Horno&#x27;s &quot;Ho!&quot;, to release &quot;Ho Riddim&quot; with P Money.

At the tail end of 2010 and in 2011, P Money featured on two singles which hit the charts, the first being &quot;Pow 2011&quot; which peaked at No. 33 on the UK charts and featured fellow grime artists Lethal Bizzle, Jme, Wiley, Chip, 2Face, Ghetts and Kano. Even though P Money and Ghetts were involved in a beef at the time, they squashed the beef to appear on the track.
The second was &quot;Anthemic&quot;, which was released as the fourth single from Magnetic Man&#x27;s eponymous debut album &quot;Magnetic Man&quot;; this reached No. 50 on the UK charts. At the time it was also the &quot;Hottest Record in the World&quot; on Zane Lowe&#x27;s weekly blog.

P Money also finished eighth in MTV&#x27;s list of the best UK MCs of 2010, which was announced in February 2011. This sparked a response from fellow UK MC Ghetts, who was left off the list, and aimed criticism at P Money in his track &quot;Who&#x27;s on the Panel&quot;. After trading war dubs between each other, the battle between the two MCs came to a head when Risky Roadz offered to film and stream a live clash on &quot;Mic Fight&quot;, with P Money signing the contract but Ghetts ultimately pulling out.

P Money released &quot;Boo You&quot; alongside Blacks on Butterz in May 2011, the first and one of the few vocal releases on the label.

P Money also toured with English rapper Example&#x27;s in his UK stadium tour during 2011 and 2012 along with British rapper Wretch 32 and American DJ Alvin Risk. He also opened for Tyga&#x27;s UK tour.

On 27 August 2012, he released the &quot;Dubsteppin&quot; EP through Rinse. He also appeared on the DJ Zinc single &quot;Reload&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Goin&#x27; In&quot;.

His third EP, &quot;Round the Clock&quot;, featuring a title track produced by Loadstar, was released on 18 November 2013. The EP features three other tracks and a remix of the title track.

In May 2014, P Money infamously &#x27;clashed&#x27; with North London MC Big H at Lord of the Mics 6, a grime-focused battle series curated by Jammer, a ubiquitous figure within the grime scene and member of influential grime crew Boy Better Know. The event, despite being advertised as one of the most noteworthy events in the genre&#x27;s short history, was ultimately met with widespread disappointment by fans, as Big H left the stage, citing unsatisfactory payment, before the &#x27;clash&#x27; could reach its intended conclusion. 

He later featured in &quot;Lamborghini&quot; by gaming YouTuber and influencer KSI, a single which reached number 30 on the UK Singles Chart.
His 2019 track &quot;Where &amp; When&quot;, a collaborative effort in conjunction with rapper Giggs released on P Money&#x27;s mixtape &quot;Money Over Everyone 3&quot;, was included on the soundtrack of popular football simulation video game &quot;FIFA 20&quot;.

In 2021, P Money released &quot;This Year&quot;, a collaboration with Silencer featuring YouTuber and rapper TBJZL. The music video was posted on P Money&#x27;s YouTube channel on March 18, 2021.

==Personal life==
P Money is of Jamaican descent. He is a fan of Arsenal F.C. He has two sons.

<doc id="1328444" wikidata="Q3064473" url="?curid=1328444" title="Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid">
<text>Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid (, &quot;Fakhr un-nisa&quot; or &quot;Fahr-El-Nissa&quot;, born Fahrünissa Şakir; 6 December 1901 – 5 September 1991) was a Turkish artist best known for her large-scale abstract paintings with kaleidoscopic patterns as well as her drawings, lithographs, and sculptures. Zeid was one of the first women to go to art school in Istanbul.

She lived in different cities and became part of the avant-garde scenes in 1940s Istanbul, and post-war Paris, there becoming part of the new School of Paris. Her work has been exhibited at various institutions in Paris, New York, and London, including the Institute of Contemporary Art in 1954. In the 1970s, she moved to Amman, Jordan, where she established an art school. In 2017, Tate Modern in London organised a major retrospective and called her &quot;one of the greatest female artists of the 20th century&quot;. Her largest work to be sold at auction, &quot;Towards a Sky&quot; (1953), went for just under one million pounds in 2017. Her record is the USD 2,741,000 sale of her Break of the Atom and Vegetal Life (1962) in 2013 by Christies.

In 1920, Şakir married Izzet Devrim, with whom she had three children: Faruk, Nejad, and Şirin. Şakir divorced Devrim in 1934. The same year, she married Prince Zeid bin Hussein, a member of the Hashemite royal family of Iraq. They were the parents of Prince Ra&#x27;ad bin Zeid.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Fahrünissa Şakir was born in 1901 into the Ottoman Şakır family on the island of Büyükada in Istanbul. Her uncle Ahmed Javad Pasha served as the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire from 1891 to 1895 and another uncle, Cevat Çobanlı, was a World War I hero. Fahrünissa&#x27;s father, Şakir Pasha, was appointed ambassador to Greece, where he met her mother, Sara İsmet Hanım. In 1913, her father was fatally shot and her brother, Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı, was tried and convicted of his murder.

Şakir began drawing and painting at a young age. Her earliest known surviving work is a portrait of her grandmother, painted when she was 14. In 1919, she enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts for Women in Istanbul.

In 1920 at the age of nineteen, Şakir married the novelist İzzet Melih Devrim. For their honeymoon, Devrim took Şakir to Venice where she was exposed to European painting traditions for the first time. They had three children together. Her eldest son, Faruk (born 1921), died of scarlet fever in 1924. Her son Nejad Devrim (born 1923) went on to become a painter, and her daughter Şirin Devrim (born 1926) became an actress.

Şakir travelled to Paris in 1928 and enrolled at the Académie Ranson, where she studied under the painter Roger Bissière. Upon her return to Istanbul in 1929, she abandoned her academic figurative practice and turned towards expressionist figurativism, and enrolled at the Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts.

Şakir&#x27;s brother Cevat, better known as the Fisherman of Halicarnassus, was a novelist. Under her tutelage, her sister Aliye Berger became a major modernist painter and engraver, while her niece Fureya Koral became a pioneering ceramic artist.


=== 1930–1944 ===
Şakir divorced Devrim in 1934, and married Prince Zeid bin Hussein of Iraq, who was appointed the first Ambassador of the Kingdom of Iraq to Germany in 1935. The couple moved to Berlin where Fahrelnissa hosted many social events in her role as an ambassador&#x27;s wife. After the annexation of Austria in March 1938, Prince Zeid and his family were recalled to Iraq, taking up residence in Baghdad.

Fahrelnissa Zeid became depressed in Baghdad and on the advice of Viennese doctor Hans Hoff returned to Paris after a short time. She spent the next years of her life traveling between Paris, Budapest, and Istanbul, attempting to immerse herself in painting and recover. By 1941, she was back in Istanbul and focusing on her painting.

Zeid became involved with the D Group of Istanbul, an avant-garde group of painters working in the newly formed Turkish Republic. Although her association with the group was short-lived, working with the D Group from 1944 gave Zeid the confidence to begin exhibiting on her own.

=== 1945–1957 ===
In 1945, Zeid cleared out the parlour rooms of her apartment in Maçka, Istanbul, and held her first solo exhibition. In 1946, after two more solo exhibitions in İzmir in 1945 and in Istanbul in 1946, Zeid relocated to London where Prince Zeid Al-Hussein became the first Ambassador of the Kingdom of Iraq to the Court of St James&#x27;s. Zeid continued to paint, turning a room in the Iraqi Embassy into her studio.

From 1947, Zeid&#x27;s practice became more complex and her work transitioned from figurative painting to abstraction. She was influenced by the abstract styles coming out of Paris in the post-war period.

Queen Elizabeth visited Zeid&#x27;s exhibition at Saint George&#x27;s Gallery in London in 1948. Art critic Maurice Collis reviewed that exhibition, and he and Zeid became friends. The prominent French art critic and curator Charles Estienne became a major supporter of Zeid&#x27;s work. She was part of the founding exhibition of the Nouvelle Ecole de Paris organised by Estienne in 1952 at the Galerie Babylone.

Over the next decade, living between London and Paris, Zeid created some of her strongest works, experimenting with monumental abstract canvases that immerse the viewer in kaleidoscopic universes through their heavy use of line and vibrant colour. Zeid exhibited at Galerie Dina Vierny in 1953, showing her most recent abstract works such as &quot;The Octopus of Triton&quot;, and &quot;Sargasso Sea&quot;. The exhibition travelled to the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1954, making her the first woman of any nationality to exhibit at the modernist showcase. At the height of her career, she became friends with a group of international artists such as Jean-Michel Atlan, Jean Dubuffet and Serge Poliakoff, who experimented with gestural abstraction. Fahrelnissa Zeid also exhibited frequently alongside other members of the Nouvelle Ecole de Paris in small group exhibitions, as well as exhibiting at the Salon des Realites Nouvelles Salon des Réalités Nouvelles.

=== 1958–1991 ===
In 1958, Zeid persuaded her husband not to return to Baghdad as acting regent as he usually did while his great-nephew King Faisal II took a vacation. The couple went to their new holiday home on the island of Ischia in the Gulf of Naples. On 14 July 1958 there was a military coup in Iraq and the entire royal family was assassinated. Prince Zeid and his family narrowly escaped death, and they were given only 24 hours to vacate the Iraqi Embassy in London. The coup halted Zeid&#x27;s career as a painter and hostess in London.

Zeid and her family moved into an apartment in Paris and at the age of fifty-seven, she cooked her first meal. The experience prompted her to begin painting on chicken bones, later creating sculptures from the bones cast in resin, called &quot;paléokrystalos&quot;. The 1960s were a period of both renewal and looking back for Zeid. She immersed herself in renewing her portrait practice alongside her abstract work. At the same time, she had two large-scale homecoming retrospectives in Turkey in 1964, in Istanbul and Ankara. She prepared for a large exhibition in Paris in the late 1960 after meeting André Malraux but it never happened after the dismissal by Malraux of Jacques Jaujard who coordinated with her, and the subsequent May 1968 May 68 events. Still Zeid continued exhibiting in Paris through 1972.

In the 1960s Zeid&#x27;s youngest son, Prince Raad, married and moved to Amman, Jordan. In 1970, Prince Zeid died in Paris and Fahrelnissa Zeid moved to join her son in Amman in 1975. She founded The Royal National Jordanian Institute Fahrelnissa Zeid of Fine Arts in 1976, and for the next fifteen years until her death in 1991 taught and mentored a group of young women.

== Retrospectives and legacy ==
Museum Ludwig held Zeid&#x27;s first retrospective in the west in 1990.

In October 2012, Bonhams auctioned a number of Zeid&#x27;s paintings for a total of £2,021,838, setting a world record for the artist.

In 2017, Tate Modern in London organised a major retrospective of Fahrelnissa Zeid. According to an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the exhibition aimed to lift the artist &quot;out of obscurity to ensure that she does not become yet another female artist forgotten by history.&quot; The central gallery of the exhibition hosted large-scale, abstract paintings of Zeid from the late 1940s and 1950s including her five-meter work titled &quot;My Hell&quot; (1951). The last gallery was devoted to the portraits Zeid concentrated on in her last years in Amman, as well as resin sculptures. All the works in the exhibition were loaned from international collections and Tate Modern acquired one of the paintings, &quot;Untitled C&quot;, &quot;so she can now be part of our narrative,&quot; according to Tate Modern Director Frances Morris. The exhibition traveled to Deutsche Bank KunstHalle in late 2017. Istanbul Modern lent eight works to the retrospective exhibition and also organised the exhibition &quot;Fahrelnissa Zeid&quot; in spring 2017 with works from its collection, focusing on works created between the 1940s and 1970s. Istanbul Modern director Levent Çalıkoğlu stated, &quot;The belated interest of Western museums and art community in Zeid’s works. . . is restoring the value she deserves.&quot;

In 2019 Zeid was commemorated with a &quot;Google Doodle&quot;. Zeid&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

In her lifetime and even after her death, Zeid’s work was beset by orientalist assessments that she fused Islamic and byzantine influences with modernism. The 2017 exhibitions. which strove to place her within the narratives of the transnational abstract practices of mid-twentieth century art, were criticised for their ‘Eurocentric’ framing. The concurrent publication of the artist’s biography &quot;Fahrelnissa Zeid: Painter of Inner Worlds&quot;, written by Adila Laïdi-Hanieh, a former student of Zeid&#x27;s, was seen as upsetting those narratives that explained her art from an ‘Orientalist’ perspective in a way that quite disengaged from the artist herself.
Zeid often expressed her modernist sensibilities. Her inclinations were towards a more universalist, elemental vision of art-making. In 1952 she told the art critic Julien Alvard that:” I am a means to an end. I transpose the cosmic, magnetic vibrations that rule us… I am not a pole, a centre, a myself, a somebody. I act as a channel for that which should and can be transposed by me … painting is for me, flow, movement, speed, encounters, departures, enlargement that knows no limits.&quot;

Adila Laïdi-Hanieh&#x27;s &quot;Fahrelnissa Zeid: Painter of Inner Worlds&quot; offers a revisionist and definitive account of both her life and career, and emphasises the importance of her immersion in European culture and her shifting mental state on her artistic vision and constantly renewing bold practice. It redefines Fahrelnissa Zeid as one of the most important modernists of the twentieth century.

Zeid&#x27;s colourful family life is described in her daughter Shirin Devrim&#x27;s book, &quot;A Turkish Tapestry: The Shakirs of Istanbul&quot;, published in 1994.

<text>Maneka Gandhi (also spelled Menaka; &quot;née&quot; Anand) (born 26 August 1956) is an Indian politician, animal rights activist, and environmentalist. She served as a member of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, and is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She is the widow of Indian politician Sanjay Gandhi. Gandhi has held ministerial positions in four governments, most recently serving in Narendra Modi&#x27;s government from May 2014 to May 2019. 

In addition to her political work, Gandhi is an author, with several books on etymology, law, and animal rights.

==Personal life==
Maneka Anand was born on 26 August 1956 in Delhi, India, into a Sikh family. Her father, Lt. Col. Tarlochan Singh Anand, served as an officer in the Indian Army, and her mother, Amardeep Kaur Anand, was the daughter of Sir Datar Singh. Maneka attended The Lawrence School, Sanawar and later studied at Lady Shri Ram College for Women. She subsequently studied German at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.

Maneka first met Sanjay Gandhi in 1973 at a cocktail party hosted by her uncle, Major-General Kapur, to celebrate his son&#x27;s upcoming wedding. Maneka married Sanjay, the son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, one year later on 23 September 1974.

During The Emergency of 1975–77, Sanjay rose to political prominence, and Maneka frequently accompanied him on tours, assisting with his campaigns. It is often said that during the Emergency, Sanjay had significant influence over his mother, Indira, and that the government was effectively run from the Prime Minister&#x27;s House (PMH) rather than the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO).

Maneka Gandhi founded the news magazine &quot;Surya,&quot; which later played a key role in promoting the Congress party after its defeat in the 1977 election following the Emergency.

Gandhi also went to court to fight an attempt by the government in power to confiscate her passport, winning a landmark decision on personal liberty in the case of &quot;Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India.&quot; The court found that &quot;Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratic setup.&quot;

In 1980, Gandhi gave birth to a son, Feroze, named after his paternal grandfather. Her mother-in-law added the name Varun. Maneka was widowed at just twenty-three years old, with Varun only 100 days old, when her husband died in an air crash.

==Early life and career==
Maneka&#x27;s relationship with Indira Gandhi deteriorated following Sanjay&#x27;s death, with frequent arguments leading to an eventual rift. Maneka was ultimately asked to leave 1, Safdarjung Road, the prime minister’s residence, after a dispute with Indira. On April 3, 1983, she co-founded the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch with Akbar Ahmad, focusing on youth empowerment and employment. The party won four out of five seats in the Elections in Andhra Pradesh.

Gandhi later published &quot;The Complete Book of Muslim and Parsi Names&quot;, acknowledging her husband’s Zoroastrian heritage. She also published &quot;The Penguin Book of Hindu Names for Boys&quot;.

Her personal secretary was Vijay Samnotra, an Indian Civil Servant and former head of the United Nations Environment Programme.

In the 1984 Indian general election, Gandhi contested the Amethi constituency in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha but was defeated by Rajiv Gandhi. In 1988, she joined V. P. Singh&#x27;s Janata Dal Party and became its General Secretary. Gandhi won her first election to Parliament in the 1989 Indian general election and served as the Minister of State for Environment in the V. P. Singh ministry.

==Activism==
Maneka Gandhi is an environmentalist and animal rights advocate in India. She has earned international recognition and awards for her work. In 1995, she was appointed chairwoman of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). Under her leadership, CPCSEA members conducted unannounced inspections of laboratories using animals for scientific research.

In 1996, Gandhi protested the opening of the first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in India, stating that &quot;we don&#x27;t need cow killers in India&quot; to justify her opposition.

Gandhi has filed Public Interest Litigations that led to the replacement of municipal killing of homeless dogs with a sterilization program (commonly known as ABC programs), regulated the sale of airguns, and banned mobile or traveling zoos. She currently chairs the Jury of the International Energy Globe Foundation, which meets annually in Austria to award the year’s best environmental innovations. She also serves on the boards of Eurosolar and the Wuppertal Institute in Germany.

In 1992, Gandhi founded &quot;People for Animals&quot;, now the largest animal rights organization in India. She is a patron of International Animal Rescue. As a vegan, she promotes this lifestyle for ethical and health reasons. She also hosted the weekly television program &quot;Heads and Tails&quot;, which highlighted the suffering of animals due to commercial exploitation, and later authored a book with the same title. Her other books cover Indian names. Additionally, she appeared in the documentary &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot;.

In September 2023, Gandhi advocated for protecting Dol Ka Badh forest in Jaipur, writing a letter to the chief secretary of Rajasthan with examples supporting the forest’s conservation.

==Criticism==
Gandhi has often faced criticism for her comments.

;Threatening a Veterinarian Over the Phone 
In June 2021, Gandhi called a veterinarian, threatening to cancel his license over what she deemed a botched amputation surgery on a dog. Despite the veterinarian’s efforts to explain that he had exercised due care and that the dog, being aggressive, had torn off its own bandages and reopened its wounds post-surgery, Gandhi reportedly used abusive and unparliamentary language. The recorded call was later shared widely on social media, leading veterinary associations to condemn and protest her behavior.

;Views on Male Suicide 
In June 2017, during a Facebook Live session, Gandhi claimed that men do not commit suicide. Her comment received backlash, with participants pointing out that 68% of suicide cases reported in India involved men. Gandhi then spent the rest of the session responding to related questions.

;False Harassment Threat
In January 2021, activist Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj shared an audio recording in which Gandhi allegedly berated a man for hitting a dog and threatened to file a sexual harassment complaint against him. The man claimed the incident was in self-defense, as the dog had bitten his daughter.

;Curfew for Women 
In March 2017, Gandhi stated that early curfews for young women in hostels helped control &quot;hormonal outbursts.&quot; The remark prompted widespread backlash.

;Views on Marital Rape 
In 2016, Gandhi voiced her opposition to criminalizing marital rape, a stance that sparked significant criticism.

;Alleged Spread of Hatred Against Muslims 
In June 2020, Kerala police filed a case against Gandhi following complaints that her statements regarding the death of a pregnant elephant promoted communal hatred. Gandhi accused residents of the Muslim-majority district Malappuram, despite the elephant&#x27;s death occurring in a different district, Palakkad, approximately 90 km away. BJP leaders, including Gandhi, focused on Malappuram in their statements. She claimed: “It’s a murder. Malappuram is famous for such incidents, it’s India’s most violent district. For instance, they throw poison on roads so that 300–400 birds &amp; dogs die at one time.” Gandhi was accused of communalizing the incident, which would otherwise have been under the jurisdiction of the Department of Forests. A group named Kerala Cyber Warriors later hacked the website of Gandhi&#x27;s organization, People for Animals, in protest.

<doc id="1328450" wikidata="Q17457835" url="?curid=1328450" title="Electric shaver">
<text>An electric shaver (also known as the dry razor, electric razor, or simply shaver) is a razor with an electrically powered rotating or oscillating blade. The electric shaver usually does not require the use of shaving cream, soap, or water. The razor may be powered by a small DC motor, which is either powered by batteries or mains electricity. Many modern ones are powered using rechargeable batteries. Alternatively, an electro-mechanical oscillator driven by an AC-energized solenoid may be used. Some very early mechanical shavers had no electric motor and had to be powered by hand, for example by pulling a cord to drive a flywheel.

Electric shavers fall into two main categories: foil or rotary-style. Users tend to prefer one or the other. Many modern shavers are cordless; they are charged up with a plug charger or they are placed within a cleaning and charging unit.

==History==

The first person to receive a patent for a razor powered by electricity was John Francis O&#x27;Rourke, a New York civil engineer, with his US patent 616554 filed in 1898. The first working electric razor was invented in 1915 by German engineer Johann Bruecker. Others followed suit, such as the American Col. Jacob Schick, considered to be the father of the modern electric razor, who patented the first electric razor in 1930. The Remington Rand Corporation developed the electric razor further, first producing the electric razor in 1937. Another important inventor was Prof. Alexandre Horowitz, from Philips Laboratories in the Netherlands, who designed one of the first rotary razors. It has a shaving head consisting of cutters that cut off the hair entering the head of the razor at skin level. Roland Ullmann from Braun in Germany was another inventor who was decisive for development of the modern electric razor. He was the first to fuse rubber and metal elements on shavers and developed more than 100 electrical razors for Braun. In the course of his career Ullmann filed well over 100 patents for innovations in the context of dry shavers. The major manufacturers introduce new improvements to the hair-cutting mechanism of their products every few years. Each manufacturer sells several different generations of cutting mechanism at the same time, and for each generation, several models with different features and accessories to reach various price points. The improvements to the cutting mechanisms tend to &#x27;trickle-down&#x27; to lower-priced models over time.

Early versions of electric razors were meant to be used on dry skin only. Many recent electric razors have been designed to allow for wet/dry use, which also allows them to be cleaned using running water or an included cleaning machine, reducing cleaning effort. Some patience is necessary when starting to use a razor of this type, as the skin usually takes some time to adjust to the way that the electric razor lifts and cuts the hairs. Moisturizers designed specifically for electric shaving are available.

===Battery-powered electric razors===
In the late 1940s, the first electric razors that were battery-powered entered the market. In 1960, Remington introduced the first rechargeable battery-powered electric razor. Battery-operated electric razors have been available using rechargeable batteries sealed inside the razor&#x27;s case, previously nickel cadmium or, more recently, nickel metal hydride. Some modern shavers use Lithium-ion batteries (which do not suffer from memory effect). Sealed battery shavers either have built-in or external charging devices. Some shavers may be designed to plug directly into a wall outlet with a swing-out or pop-up plug, or have a detachable AC cord. Other shavers have recharging base units that plug into an AC outlet and provide DC power at the base contacts (eliminating the need for the AC-to-DC converter to be inside the razor, reducing the risk of electric shock). In order to prevent any risk of electric shock, shavers designed for wet use usually do not allow corded use and will not turn on until the charging adapter cord is disconnected or the shaver is removed from the charging base.
=== Razor vs. trimmer ===

An electric razor and an electric trimmer are essentially the same devices by build, the major difference coming in terms of their usage and the blades that they come with.

Electric razors are made specifically for providing a clean shave. It has lesser battery power but more aggression towards clipping hair. Electric Trimmers, on the other hand, are not meant for clean shaves. They come with special combs fixed onto them that aid in proper grooming and trimming of the beard stubs to desired shapes and sizes.

==General==
Some models, generally marketed as &quot;travel razors&quot; (or &quot;travel shavers&quot;), use removable rechargeable or disposable batteries, usually size AA or AAA. This offers the option of purchasing batteries while traveling instead of carrying a charging device.

==Water-resistance and wet/dry electric shavers==
Many modern electric shavers are water-resistant, allowing the user to clean the shaver in water. In order to ensure electrical safety, the charging/power cord for the shaver must be unplugged from it before the unit is cleaned using water.

Some shavers are labeled as &quot;Wet/Dry&quot; which means the unit can be used in wet environments, for wet shaving. Such models are always battery-powered and usually the electronics will not allow turning the unit on while the charging adapter is plugged-in. This is necessary to ensure electrical safety, as it would be unsafe to use a plugged-in shaver in bathtub or shower.

==Lady shaver==
A lady shaver is a device designed to shave a woman&#x27;s body hair. The design is usually similar to a man&#x27;s foil shaver. Often a shaving attachment is a feature of an epilator which is supplied as a separate head-attachment (different from the epilating one).

==Body hair shaver==
Traditional men&#x27;s shavers are designed for shaving facial hair. However, other shaver products are made specifically to facilitate shaving of body hair.

<doc id="1328452" wikidata="Q4768226" url="?curid=1328452" title="Anne Charleston">
<text>Anne Charleston (born 30 December 1942) is an Australian actress, notable for her career locally and in the United Kingdom in theatre and television. She began her career on the stage in the mid-1950s before moving onto the small screen in the early 1960s, appearing in various telefilms. Following parts in a range of series by Crawford Productions, Charleston became known for her work in the cult classic series &quot;Prisoner&quot;, where she played three different characters between 1979 and 1984. Her most prominent television roles were in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, where she played matriarch Madge Bishop (1986–1992; 1996–2001), and the British soap &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, playing Lily Butterfield (2006–2009).

==Career==

=== Early television roles ===
Anne Charleston first became widely recognisable in Australia starting from the late 1960s on television, taking various guest roles in the Crawford Productions police dramas including &quot;Homicide&quot;, &quot;Division 4&quot; and &quot;Matlock Police&quot;. Other appearances included guest roles in other Crawford&#x27;s adventure series &quot;Hunter&quot; (1967) and &quot;Ryan&quot; (1973), and in Network Ten-produced police drama &quot;The Long Arm&quot; (1971). She was in TV plays such as &quot;Man of Destiny&quot; and &quot;The Shifting Heart&quot; (1968).

=== Recurring TV roles: Bellbird and Number 96 ===
She had continuing roles in soap operas &quot;Bellbird&quot; and &quot;Class of &#x27;75&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Number 96&quot; as a deranged woman named Stella who kidnapped Alf (James Elliot) and Lucy Sutcliffe&#x27;s (Elisabeth Kirkby) baby in late 1975. She also appeared in the feature film version of &quot;Bellbird&quot;, &quot;Country Town&quot; (1971), playing a different character from that which she had played in the series.

=== Prisoner (TV series) ===
In the late 1970s and the 1980s she became internationally renowned thanks to several small roles in soap opera &quot;Prisoner&quot;. She briefly played the brusque daughter of released prisoner Jeanette &quot;Mum&quot; Brooks (played by Mary Ward) in 1979, and mother of Judith-Ann, Charleston returned for several appearances in the serial as a policewoman through the early 1980s before taking the larger recurring role of Deidre Kean, mother of prison toughie Reb Kean (Janet Andrewartha), in 1984. 

The role was intended to be a long term character in &quot;Prisoner&quot;, however, in 1985, Grundy cast her in a leading regular role in new soap opera, &quot;Possession&quot;; however, the series was cancelled by the network later that same year due to lower than desired ratings.

=== Australian theatre ===
Charleston had also enjoyed a busy career acting in the Australian theatre. With St. Martin&#x27;s Theatre she acted in &quot;Wrong Side of the Park&quot;, &quot;The Irregular Verb&quot;, &quot;To Love&quot;, &quot;Angels in Love&quot;, &quot;A Far Country&quot;, &quot;The Anniversary&quot;, &quot;Invitation to a March&quot;, &quot;Eden House&quot;, &quot;The Cavern&quot;, &quot;Have you Any Dirty Washing Mother Dear&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; and &quot;Children&#x27;s Day&quot;.

She also appeared in J C Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Woman in a Dressing Gown&quot; starring Googie Withers, &quot;Juggler&#x27;s Three&quot; for the Melbourne Theatre Company Workshop, and &quot;The Secretary Bird&quot; starring Patrick Macnee. Other theatre includes &quot;Busybody&quot;, &quot;Port Wine&quot;, &quot;Night of the Ding Dong&quot;, &quot;Burst of Summer&quot;, &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;, &quot;The Rivals&quot;, &quot;The Tower&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;The Man of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot; and &quot;The Shifting Heart&quot;.

=== &quot;Neighbours&quot; ===
In 1986, Charleston was cast as Madge Bishop (Mitchell) in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Madge was a new character added to the series when it switched to Network Ten. The series became popular in Australia and the United Kingdom in the years following. Through the series Charleston became internationally recognised, and won a Penguin Award in 1987 for Best Performance By an Actress in a Series/Serial. In 1989, she and Smith recorded the Christmas song &quot;Old Fashioned Christmas&quot; which was released in the UK.

In 1992, Charleston left the series and emigrated to the Republic of Ireland. Four years later she accepted the offer to return to &quot;Neighbours&quot;, reprising the role from 1996. In her second stint in the series, Charleston observed that Madge had been transformed from being bold and fiery to a more meek and passive character, a change that led to her ultimate decision to leave the series in 2000. Her final episode was broadcast in Australia during April 2001. She returned to &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 2015 alongside co-star Ian Smith to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the serial. Charleston also appeared in a documentary celebrating the anniversary titled &quot;Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite&quot;, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.

Following the news of &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; cancellation, Charleston reprised her role of Madge, imagined by Susan Kennedy as to how she might look if still alive, in the show&#x27;s then-final episode, which aired on 28 July 2022.

On 2 December 2024, it was announced that Charleston would be returning to &quot;Neighbours&quot; in a new role as part of Harold&#x27;s departure storyline, following Smith&#x27;s cancer diagnosis.

=== After &quot;Neighbours&quot; ===
In 1989, Charleston took on the role of another &#x27;Madge&#x27;, Madge Allsop in an episode of &quot;The Dame Edna Experience&quot; on ITV in the UK, when Dame Edna Everage asked Doctor Christiaan Barnard to give her bridesmaid a face lift. Dame Edna did not like Madge&#x27;s new face, so asked the surgeon to reverse the operation, restoring Emily Perry to the role.

In 2013, Charleston played a role in the Prisoner remake, &quot;Wentworth&quot;. The role saw her portraying the mother-in-law of prisoner Liz Birdsworth.

After leaving &quot;Neighbours&quot; for the first time, Charleston lived in Ireland for several years, and returned there after leaving the series again in 2001. With the high levels of popularity enjoyed by &quot;Neighbours&quot; in the UK, Charleston has now relaunched her career there. She has undertaken theatre and radio work in the UK and Ireland since leaving &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 2001, and is also a regular performer in pantomime. In 2001, she appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;.

Charleston took the role of Dossa in comedy series &quot;Dossa and Joe&quot;, and then had the regular role of Betty Waddell in the relaunched series of &quot;Crossroads&quot; in 2003. In 2004 she was a contestant in the second series of the Living TV reality television show, &quot;I&#x27;m Famous and Frightened!&quot;

In 2005, she had cosmetic surgery performed on her neck, live on British television, on the Channel 5 programme, &quot;Cosmetic Surgery Live&quot;. In the same year, she also &quot;regressed into a previous life&quot;, as a poor Irish farm girl, when she appeared in the programme &quot;Have I Been Here Before?&quot;.

In August 2012, Charleston was a contestant on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;.

=== &quot;Emmerdale&quot; ===
In late 2006, Charleston joined the cast of &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, originating the character of Lily Butterfield, the estranged sister of Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox) who arrives to attend her great niece Eve&#x27;s wedding blessing. Unbeknown to Edna and Lily, Edna&#x27;s son Peter has invited them both to try to get them to make amends. However, a dark family secret will ensure their reunion does not run smoothly.

Of her new role, Charleston said: &quot;I am over the moon to be joining one of my favourite soaps. I am delighted to be playing such a fantastic character.&quot; Series Producer Kathleen Beedles added: &quot;We are thrilled to confirm that Anne will be playing the character of Lily. Viewers can expect to see sparks fly when Edna and Lily are reunited and we are looking forward to welcoming Anne on-set.&quot; Charleson&#x27;s first taping day was on Monday 25 September 2006, and she first appeared on screen on Friday 3 November 2006. She appeared in only three episodes. The character returned in October 2007 for a four-month run, and returned again in 2008 on a regular contract. Charleston quit in April 2009 and the character was subsequently written out of the serial and made her last appearance on 3 August 2009.

=== Theatre ===
Charleston has appeared in theatre roles both locally and internationally in her native Australia; her theatre credits go back to the mid-1950s 

Anne starred in &quot;Aladdin&quot; at Belfast Grand Opera House in 1995–1996 with Rod Hull and Emu.
In January 2010, it was announced that Charleston would be joining the touring production of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; as Jessie (Miss January).

<text>Pentagon City is an unincorporated neighborhood located in the southeast portion of Arlington County, Virginia. It is located near The Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery.

==Location==
Pentagon City is located less than a mile from the Potomac River, which separates the Commonwealth of Virginia from Washington, D.C. It is located on the Blue and Yellow Lines of the Washington Metro, and the Pentagon City Metro station is one of the busiest in the Metrorail system during peak and off-peak hours. It&#x27;s located two miles away from the National Mall in downtown Washington. The area is a popular site for hotels and businesses.

The Pentagon has parking lots on both sides of nearby Shirley Memorial Highway (I-395), on the north edge of Pentagon City. The neighborhood of Crystal City borders Pentagon City to the east along Richmond Highway (U.S. Route 1), separating Pentagon City from National Airport. To the south is the neighborhood of Aurora Highlands and the Virginia Highlands Park. To the west is the neighborhood of Arlington Ridge. Washington Boulevard (State Route 27), Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50), Columbia Pike (State Route 244), and State Route 110 are nearby major thoroughfares.

==History==

===20th century===
Pentagon City was founded in 1946, when developers Morris Cafritz and Charles H. Tompkins acquired a 190-acre site of empty fields and commercial warehouses for $1.5 million. A Western Electric telephone manufacturing facility opened in the 1950s and was later converted into a small shopping mall known as &quot;Pentagon Centre.&quot; In the 1960s, high-rise apartment buildings were erected on Hayes, Fern, and Joyce Streets.

On July 1, 1977, the Pentagon City Metrorail station opened on the Blue Line. Although the new station bordered a large empty field, in 10 years the station stimulated high-density development.

In the 1990s, MCI Communications had a major presence in Pentagon City, with the company&#x27;s Consumer Markets headquarters occupying Washington Tower, a 12-story office building that sits atop the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City (a 4-story indoor shopping mall that opened in 1989). MCI also occupied two of the four office towers immediately across South Hayes Street, known as Pentagon City I and II (often abbreviated &quot;PCY&quot;).

===21st century===
In 2003, the Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority proposed five Northern Virginia sites as possible locations to host the relocating Montreal Expos. Pentagon Centre was one of three sites in Arlington County; the other two proposed Arlington sites were a plot of undeveloped land closer to The Pentagon and a site in Rosslyn. The issue was highly divisive and some Pentagon City residents launched a visible campaign against it. After the Arlington County Board opposed a stadium in Arlington, the final Virginia bid featured a site near Dulles Airport instead. Major League Baseball finally announced in fall of 2004 that the Expos would move to Washington, D.C. as the Washington Nationals.

==Commercial==

The area includes a multi-level indoor shopping mall, the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, also known as the Pentagon City Mall. On the west side of the Fashion Centre is Pentagon Row, which includes a grocery store and smaller specialty stores and restaurants in the midst of high-end apartments. Pentagon Row features an outdoor ice rink during the winter and a free outdoor concert series on the plaza in the summer. A third shopping facility, Pentagon Centre, is located to the east of the Fashion Centre across Hayes Street.

Pentagon City also is home to the DEA, TSA, and other office buildings housing various federal government agencies and businesses. Given the proximity to The Pentagon, many are Defense-related businesses. The Drug Enforcement Administration Museum and Visitors Center is located nearby on Army Navy Drive.

==Residential==
Within Pentagon City there are many high-rise luxury apartments and condos. Around the Fashion Centre Mall complex are several apartment buildings including The Metropolitan at Pentagon Row, Pentagon Row, and Park View. Across from the Pentagon City Mall and Costco is the four-story Southampton Condominium townhouse community. Also on that block are Claridge House, and Potomac Center Genesis Care; both residences for retired as well as disabled residents.

There is an open eight phase construction site next door to Costco on Fern Street, where the new Metropolitan Park development is being constructed. Kettler, real-estate development and property management company, razed warehouses that were a portion of an older industrial park for the project. The first phase of the project, completed in late 2007, consisted of The Gramercy at Metropolitan Park high-end rental apartments. Phase two of the project was completed in late 2009 and consists of The Millennium at Metropolitan Park, a second high-end rental apartment building. Both phases were architecturally planned by Robert A.M. Stern and include ground floor retail spaces suitable for any use. A two-and-a-half-acre park, with commissioned art, is also being constructed at the center of the project.

Virginia Highlands Park, located immediately south of the central retail area, provides a lush green space as well as basketball, tennis, soccer, and softball/baseball facilities. Adjacent to the park are the Aurora Hills branch of the Arlington Public Library system and a firehouse. The suburban neighborhood of Aurora Highlands, which consists primarily of single-family detached housing, extends due south of Pentagon City.

<doc id="1328466" wikidata="Q3595611" url="?curid=1328466" title="P. K. Vasudevan Nair">
<text>Padayatt Kesavapillai Vasudevan Nair (2 March 1926 – 12 July 2005), popularly known as PKV, was an Indian politician and lawyer who served as the 7th Chief Minister of Kerala from 1978 to 1979. He was a Member of the Lok Sabha from 1957 to 1971 and again from 2004 until his death in 2005. He became Chief Minister on 29 October 1978, following A. K. Antony&#x27;s resignation as Chief Minister. However he resigned on 7 October 1979 owing to differences with other parties in the United Front. He served in the Kerala Legislative Assembly from 1977 to 1982. Nair was a senior member of the Communist Party of India.

He was the founder-president of the Travancore Students Union, All India Students Federation (AISF) and All India Youth Federation (AIYF). He remained with the CPI after the split in the Communist movement in 1964 and was elected the party&#x27;s State secretary in 1982.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Kidangoor village in Kottayam, Kerala to a Hindu Nair family of Kesava Pillai and Nanikutty Amma. He was their eldest child. He completed his pre-degree from SB College Changanasserry. He began his political life as a student activist while studying in Union Christian College, Aluva, when the whole country was in upheaval having entered the final phase of freedom struggle. After graduating in Physics he went on to study law at Government Law College, Thiruvananthapuram. PKV had his baptism in politics during his student days as an activist of the All India Students Federation (AISF).

== Political career ==

=== Youth politics ===
He joined the Communist Party of India in 1945 like many young radicals of his time who thought Congress were too moderate and pro-rich. The subsequent years saw him evolve as a student and youth leader. He was the president of Travancore Students&#x27; Union in 1947 and elected as President of All Kerala Students Federation in 1948.

=== Politics in Travancore-Cochin state ===
PKV was first arrested for making a speech against the royal ruler of Travancore. He was among hundreds of communists who went underground when the Communist Party of India was banned following its adoption of the Calcutta Thesis that called for armed struggle against the ruling government in 1948. He took part in underground activities from 1948 to 1951 and was arrested in 1951 in connection with students&#x27; movement.

P K Vasudevan Nair and Balraj Sahani backed the idea of All India Youth Federation. Delhi&#x27;s firebrand youth leader, Guru Radha Kishan was very active in organising the first national conference of AIYF in Delhi, this wholehearted effort was visible when more than 250 delegates and observers across India representing several youth organizations of various states attended this conference. PKV had acted as president of All India Students Federation, All India Youth Federation (AIYF) and Vice President of World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY).

=== Niyamasabha MLA and Lok Sabha MP ===
He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Tiruvalla in 1957 from Ambalappuzha in 1962 and from Peermade in 1967. He was in the panel of chairmen and secretary of CPI Parliamentary Party in the Lok Sabha from 1967 to 1970. He was elected the MLA from Alappuzha in 1977 and 1980.

=== Chief Minister ===
When the Communist Party split in 1964, he stayed with the CPI. After a long national parliamentary career, PKV returned to state politics in the 1970s and was elected to the Kerala Assembly in 1977 in the election held after the Emergency. He was the Industries Minister in the Karunakaran and A.K. Antony ministries from April 1977 to October 1978. When Antony resigned in 1979 protesting against the Congress&#x27; choice of Indira Gandhi as a candidate in Chikmagalur Lok Sabha by-election, PKV became Chief Minister with the support of the Congress on 29 October 1978 and occupied the post till 7 October 1979.
== Personal life ==
Whether in or out of power, he had always led a simple life and had been accessible to all sections of people. An ardent communist, the epitome of simplicity and a crusader for people&#x27;s causes in his long political career spanning six decades that saw him elected to the post of Chief Minister, four-time MP and leader of CPI&#x27;s Parliamentary Group in the Lok Sabha. He had left a vivid impression in the minds of the people.

From 1982 to 2004, PKV had stayed away from electoral politics, concentrating his time and energy on the organisational front. During this period, he mostly served as the state secretary of CPI.

PKV also served as editor of Janayugom daily, the organ of the Communist Party of India between 1954 and 1957.

== Death ==

<text>JOIX-DTV (channel 10), branded as , is the Kansai region flagship station of the Nippon News Network and the Nippon Television Network System, owned by the , itself partially controlled by the eponymous Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, Japan&#x27;s largest media conglomerate; Yomiuri TV forms part of Yomiuri&#x27;s main television broadcasting arm alongside Kantō region flagship Nippon Television, which owns a 15.89% share in the company. Founded as on February 13, 1958, and renamed Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation on August 1, the station started broadcasting on August 28 as the first TV station to be affiliated with Nippon Television Network Corporation. Its studios are located in the Osaka Business Park district of Osaka. It also claims the highest viewing ratings in the Kansai region as of 2024.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Nippon TV applied for TV broadcasting licenses in Osaka and Nagoya after it began broadcasting in 1953, but the Ministry of Post declined the application on the grounds that &quot;Nippon TV is a Tokyo channel, and applying for licenses in other regions is an act of crossing the boundary.&quot; At the time, Osaka had only one privately owned television station, Osaka TV Broadcasting (later merged with Asahi Broadcasting). However, because the majority of its programming mostly came from KRT (now TBS), Nippon Television and its parent company, Yomiuri Shimbun Group, began to try to establish their own television station in Osaka. Yomiuri Shimbun filed for a broadcasting license as Shin-Osaka TV in November 1956. In addition to Yomiuri Shimbun, eight other newspapers, including those from Asahi, Mainichi, Sankei, Kobe, and Kyoto, applied for TV broadcasting licenses in the Kansai region at the time, and only two licenses were issued, indicating that rivalry was fierce.

To ease the overheated competition, the Ministry of Post decided to grant an additional broadcasting license in the Osaka area, and on October 22, 1957, the new Osaka TV station was granted a broadcasting license. On August 1, 1958, Shin-Osaka TV changed its name to Yomiuri TV.

=== 1958–1988 ===
At 9:00 a.m. on August 28, 1958, Yomiuri TV was launched as the second privately owned television station in Osaka. Since Yomiuri TV is licensed as a quasi-educational station, they are required to dedicate 20%-30% of its airtime to educational programming, which resulted in being the only broadcaster at that time to air educational programs the most. At that time, Yomiuri TV produced &quot;The Tales of Genji&quot; which received positive reviews. Yomiuri TV started broadcasting color TV programming in September 1960, making it the first TV station in the Kansai region to do so. In April 1968, 30% of daytime and 45% of evening programs were broadcast in color. When Yomiuri TV renewed its broadcast license in 1965, the license category was changed from quasi-educational to general programming, which meant that a greater percentage of entertainment programming could be broadcast. In Spring of 1970, 100% of Yomiuri TV&#x27;s programming were broadcast in color.

Yomiuri TV&#x27;s ratings gradually rose after the 1970s, and by the third week of November 1973, Yomiuri TV&#x27;s daily average rating had reached 10%, and its prime time rating had reached 18.2%, making it the top-rated station in Osaka, including NHK. Since 1977, Yomiuri TV is the official sponsor along with Japan Aviation Association for the Japan International Birdman Rally, which received positive responses.On October 1, 1978 and December 2, 1985, the broadcaster started broadcasting in stereo audio (being the first among Nippon TV affiliates, and second in the world) and supported Teletext (being the first among commercial broadcasters serving the Kansai region), respectively.

=== 1988–present ===
On August 1, 1988, Yomiuri TV moved from its headquarters in Higashi-Tenma (since its inception) to Osaka Business Park. In April 1989, the channel started broadcast in enhanced-definition television. The channel ceased analog broadcasting on July 24, 2011.

On March 21, 2024, Yomiuri TV launched YTV Animation, a new production brand that will leverage the broadcaster&#x27;s long history in animation.

On November 29, 2024, Yomiuri TV alongside fellow NNN/NNS affiliates Chukyo TV, The Sapporo Television Broadcasting and Fukuoka Broadcasting System announced that it would combine and integrate its management operations to form a holding company known as Yomiuri Chukyo FS Broadcasting Holdings Corp. with its offices being located at NTVHD&#x27;s headquarters in Minato, Tokyo. The merger, classified as a joint-stock transfer is expected to close on April 1, 2025, pending approval from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Unlike a full restructuring of either YTV, CTV, STV and FBS, all four broadcasters would become wholly-owned subsidiaries of the combined company with its operations, including its corporate functions, remaining intact. The merger was approved by the shareholders of all four broadcasters, including YTV on December 24th of that year.

==Branding==
From its inception to 1988, Yomiuri TV simply used the name of the channel with Yomiuri in hiragana (よみうりテレビ) or the YTV initials. During that period the sign-on of the station was footage of the sun rising accompanied by an orchestral fanfare. After the relocation, a new logo featuring a 10 mark was added.

In line with the 50th anniversary of its founding, YTV adopted a new logo, featuring a yellow lowercase ytv wordmark with a ball (the Ten Ball) representing channel 10 (analog and digital).

<doc id="1328473" wikidata="Q2988829" url="?curid=1328473" title="George Călinescu">
<text>George Călinescu (; 19 June 1899 – 12 March 1965) was a Romanian literary critic, historian, novelist, academician and journalist, and a writer of classicist and humanist tendencies. He is currently considered one of the most important Romanian literary critics of all time, alongside Titu Maiorescu and Eugen Lovinescu, and is one of the outstanding figures of Romanian literature in the 20th century.

==Biography==

===Early childhood===
George Călinescu was born Gheorghe Vișan on 19 June 1899, the son of a housekeeper, Maria Vișan; the child was brought up by his mother&#x27;s employers, Constantin Călinescu, a worker for Romanian State Railways, and his wife Maria, in their house in Bucharest. The Călinescu family, along with their housekeeper and the child, moved first to Botoșani, then to Iași, where Gheorghe Vișan, the future writer, matriculated at the Carol I School (affiliated to the Boarding High School). In 1907, Maria Vișan accepted the Călinescus&#x27; offer to formally adopt her son, who then took the name Gheorghe Călinescu. This was his real name until his death, but, because he used the pen name G. Călinescu, after his death an apocryphal, wrong, &quot;George Călinescu&quot; name was forged by the common use. As a child Călinescu did not know who his real mother was. Finding out that the housekeeper that he used to humiliate was his real mother caused him a psychological trauma. He tried to hide his real origins for the rest of his life. 

===A model: Ramiro Ortiz===
, who taught Italian language and literature at the Faculty of Letters and philosophy, exercised a seminal influence over Călinescu&#x27;s development. Călinescu developed a strong friendship with Ortiz; years later, he would give Ortiz credit for helping him &quot;seize&quot; a literary education of extraordinary quality. Under Ortiz&#x27;s guidance Călinescu made his first translations from Italian; during his student days he translated Giovanni Papini&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;Un uomo finito&quot; and a novella from Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. Again with Ortiz&#x27;s help, he began work at the literary review &quot;Roma&quot;, the first issue appearing in January 1921, and travelled to Italy with his university colleagues. Călinescu&#x27;s first book was written in Italian under the title which appeared in 1925 and treated the Vatican&#x27;s Counter-Reformation propaganda efforts in Baroque Moldavia with heavy reliance on unpublished sources found in the Vatican Archives.

===Another model: Vasile Pârvan===
If in Bucharest, alongside Ramiro Ortiz, Călinescu realized his vocation as a creative artist and scholar, his attention in Rome was focused on Vasile Pârvan, the director of the Accademia di Romania. Călinescu was captivated by Pârvan&#x27;s erudition and work ethic, but also by his existential philosophy. Călinescu would always return to this &quot;spiritual father&quot; whenever the difficulties of life seemed to bring him to his knees. Călinescu observed that while Pârvan&#x27;s natural aptitude was fairly common, his tendency to exercise all the powers of his mind in the ascetic pursuit of an intellectual ideal was transformed into an existential philosophy: Life is transitory, but man can defeat death and oblivion through creation, thus leaving a permanent record of a temporary existence. Călinescu later said, &quot;even if not everyone is in a position to become a Pârvan, everyone can see in him a model, that is to say a way in which he too can accomplish the same renunciations.&quot;

===Doctorate in Literature – and beyond===
In 1936, Călinescu received his doctorate in literature from the University of Iași with a thesis on &quot;Avatarii faraonului Tla&quot; (&quot;The Avatars of Pharaoh Tla&quot;), a posthumous work of Mihai Eminescu whose value he was the first to publicize. In fact, this thesis was an extract from Călinescu&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Opera lui Mihai Eminescu&quot; (&quot;Mihai Eminescu&#x27;s Work&quot;), which he wrote out longhand in five copies and sent to the members of the Examination Committee. Afterwards he was named lecturer in Romanian literature at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Iași, after having won the competition for the post with the maximum possible score. In 1945, he transferred to the University of Bucharest, from which point he collaborated on the prestigious &quot;Revistă a Fundațiilor Regale&quot;, edited by Alexandru Rosetti and Camil Petrescu, until it was closed down when the King abdicated in 1947. After 1947, he was published consistently in magazines such as &quot;Gazeta literară&quot; (later to become &quot;România literară&quot;) and &quot;Contemporanul&quot;, also collaborating on &quot;Roma&quot;, &quot;Universul literar&quot;, &quot;Viața literară&quot;, &quot;Sburătorul&quot;, and &quot;Gândirea&quot;.

===Under Communism===
Călinescu was deposed from his position at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bucharest after the establishment in power of the Communist Party of Romania. He was considered a political liability despite having shown evidence of democratic, left-leaning tendencies throughout the interwar period. In the 1950s, however, he became director of the &quot;Institutul de teorie literară și folclor&quot; (&quot;The Literary Theory and Folklore Institute&quot;) and coordinated the institute&#x27;s publication, &quot;Studii și cercetări de istorie literară și folclor&quot; (&quot;Literary Theory and Folklore Studies and Research&quot;), from 1952 to 1965. He was reinvited to his post at the Faculty of Letters only in 1961; in the meantime, he produced numerous writings on wide-ranging subjects, from the aesthetic of folk tales to the history of Spanish literature.

==Research, criticism, writings==
Călinescu was the author of several fundamental texts of Romanian literary history (&quot;Viața lui Mihai Eminescu, Opera lui Mihai Eminescu,&quot; and &quot;Viața lui Ion Creangă&quot; among others). After 1945, he published significant writings on world literature (including &quot;Impresii asupra literaturii spaniole,&quot; and &quot;Scriitori străini&quot;.) His study &quot;Estetica basmului&quot;, devoted to the poetics of Romanian folk tales, underlined the range of his interests. From 1932 to 1962, he published monographs, in separate volumes, on such writers as Eminescu, fabulist Ion Creangă, realist novelist Nicolae Filimon, and poet Grigore Alexandrescu, fictionalized biographies, scholarly studies, and essays. He continued presiding over numerous academic and radio conferences and writing thousands of critical reviews until his death in 1965.

===Novelist, poet and dramatist===
Călinescu produced heavily descriptive realist novels in the mode of Honoré de Balzac, often with obvious polemical undertones lurking beneath their apparently objective style. The novel he considered his best, &quot;Enigma Otiliei&quot;, narrates an unhappy love story; &quot;Cartea nunții&quot; is a disquisition on marriage; and &quot;Bietul Ioanide&quot; and &quot;Scrinul negru&quot; present the problems of intellectuals, all against the backdrop of interwar and immediate postwar Romania. Călinescu also wrote poems (&quot;Lauda lucrurilor&quot;) and plays (&quot;Șun, mit mongol&quot;) while continuing to practice journalism, although &quot;Cronicile mizantropului&quot; abruptly became &quot;Cronicile optimistului&quot; after the Communists seized power in 1947.

===Civic and political activity under Communism===
An intellectual with liberal-left ideas who nonetheless proved flexible enough to write praises of the King under Carol&#x27;s dictatorship, Călinescu outwardly adhered to the new Communist ideology after 1947, likely noting the practical advantages of such a shift in loyalties.

He made numerous research trips to the Soviet Union (&quot;Kiev, Moscova, Leningrad&quot; appeared in 1949) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (&quot;Am fost în China nouă&quot;, in 1953), publishing his impressions in these two volumes.

From 1948 to 1953, Călinescu was mistrusted and marginalized, despite being named to the Academy of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic in 1949; even after de-Stalinization began in the Soviet Union in 1953, the Romanian establishment continued to favor the &quot;wooden-tongued,&quot; socialist realist models the Soviets had begun to abandon. Călinescu&#x27;s total inability to write convincingly in this style resulted in his continued perception as a reactionary conservative. Nonetheless, he was invited to resume his columns on a permanent basis in 1956, marking the beginning of his rehabilitation. Before the end of his life, all of his works, with the exception of his monumental &quot;Istoria&quot;, were issued in new editions. &quot;Istoria&quot; would appear (to great acclaim) only in the 1980s, through the efforts of Călinescu&#x27;s assistant Alexandru Piru.

===Final years of life===
In November 1964, George Călinescu was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and sent for treatment to the sanatorium at Otopeni. On 12 March 1965, in the middle of the night, he died, leaving behind, in the words of Geo Bogza, &quot;a body of work fundamental to the Romanian people.&quot; He was buried at Bellu Cemetery, in Bucharest.

===Post-Communist reputation===
After 1989 there began a period in which Călinescu&#x27;s civic activity under the Communist regime was called into question, and in which he was accused of collaborating with the authorities, notably by his former assistant Adrian Marino. A veritable &quot;trial by press&quot; resulted in which all of his works and activities were systematically reevaluated, proving Călinescu&#x27;s perennial value and ability to offer new generations new perspectives on his own times and the whole history of Romanian literature.

<text>Allan Gibson Steel (24 September 1858 – 15 June 1914) was an English amateur cricketer who played for Lancashire County Cricket Club from 1877 to 1893, and in Test cricket for England from 1880 to 1888. He was born in West Derby, Liverpool, and died in Paddington, Middlesex.

Steel was an all-rounder. As a right-handed batsman, he scored 7,000 career runs in 162 first-class matches at an average of 29.41 runs per completed innings with a highest score of 171 as one of eight centuries. He was a right-arm bowler with a varied action in that he could bowl both fast medium and slow medium; he also had the ability to spin the ball off the pitch as either an off break or a leg break. He took 789 first-class wickets with a best return of 9/63. He took five wickets in an innings 64 times and ten wickets in a match 20 times with a best return of 14/80. As a fielder, Steel completed 141 catches.

==Playing career==
A. G. Steel was born in West Derby, Liverpool. His father, Joseph Steel, was a Liverpool shipowner. Steel was one of seven cricketing brothers and three of his brothers Ernest (EE), Douglas (DQ) and Harold (HB) also played first-class cricket for Lancashire. After his school days at Marlborough College, where he played cricket, he proceeded to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was a member of the Cambridge University team of 1878 and topped the bowling averages for the whole of England as a freshman. According to H. S. Altham, &quot;it was unquestionably A. G. Steel&#x27;s bowling that made the difference between a good and a great eleven&quot;.

Steel is mentioned in the opening article of the first issue of &quot;&quot;. Comparing bowlers of the Hambledon Era with those of the 1880s, the editor says that the &quot;old bowling&quot; must, as a rule, have been &quot;quite plain&quot; whereas most modern bowlers attempt to emulate Steel&#x27;s expertise in &quot;twisting the ball from both sides of the wicket&quot;, meaning Steel could bowl both off breaks and leg breaks. 

Steel played in the first-ever Test Match in England at The Oval in 1880, then in the famous Test which England narrowly lost in 1882. The mock obituary was published in &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; saying &quot;R.I.P. English Cricket...the body will be cremated and the Ashes will be taken to Australia&quot;.

Soon afterwards, Steel set off for Australia with his Cambridge University friends Ivo Bligh and the Studd brothers George and Charles, and a team they had put together. They toured Australia in 1882–83 and won the agreed series 2–1, thus being given a small urn. They are commemorated by the poem inscribed on the side of the urn:

:&quot;When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;&quot;
:&quot;Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return;&quot;
:&quot;The welkin will ring loud,&quot;
:&quot;The great crowd will feel proud,&quot;
:&quot;Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn;&quot;
:&quot;And the rest coming home with the urn.&quot;

Steel scored 135 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a Fourth Test match arranged as an &quot;extra&quot; on that tour, in 1883. Over the whole tour, he topped both the batting and the bowling averages.

Steel, who was known by his initials to differentiate him from his brothers, then made his highest Test score, of 148, in 1884 which was the first-ever Test match century scored at Lord&#x27;s. His name still heads the Honours Board. These efforts led him to achieve the hypothetical number 1 ranking in ICC Test Batsman Ranking in 1884 (he retained it in 1885 as well), well over a century before that meant anything at all. He captained England in 1886 winning all three times – whitewashing the Australians 3–0. His last Test was in 1888, again as captain but losing this one.

==Later life==
In 1884, Steel became a Christian through Dwight L. Moody&#x27;s preaching, after C. T. Studd invited him to attend Moody&#x27;s campaign meeting. Steel wrote the chapter on bowling in the cricket volume of the Badminton Library (1888).

He was president of the Marylebone Cricket Club for 1902. His son Allan Ivo Steel played a handful of first-class matches for MCC and Middlesex but was killed in the First World War. Another of his sons, Jack Steel, also died in the war after being washed overboard while on route to take command of HMS &quot;Munster&quot;.

Steel died on 15 June 1914 in Paddington and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

<text>Fatima Bhutto (; , born 29 May 1982) is a Pakistani writer and columnist. Born in Kabul, she is the daughter of politician Murtaza Bhutto, sister of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr, niece of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and granddaughter of former Prime Minister and President of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. She was raised in Syria and Karachi, and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Barnard College, followed by a master&#x27;s degree from the SOAS University of London.

Bhutto is a critic of her aunt Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari, whom she accused of involvement in her father&#x27;s murder. Her non-fiction book, &quot;Songs of Blood and Sword&quot; (2010), is about her family. Bhutto has written for &quot;The News&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; among other publications.

==Early life and education==
Bhutto was born on 29 May 1982 to Murtaza Bhutto and his Afghan wife, Fauzia Fasihudin Bhutto, the daughter of Afghanistan&#x27;s former foreign affairs official in Kabul. Her father was in exile during the military regime of general Zia-ul-Haq. Her parents divorced when she was three years old and her father took Bhutto with him, moving from country to country and she grew up effectively stateless. Her father met Ghinwa Bhutto, a Lebanese ballet teacher in 1989 during his exile in Syria and they married. Bhutto considers Ghinwa as her real mother. Her half-brother Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr. is an artist based in San Francisco.

Bhutto is the granddaughter of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto, an Iranian Kurd, niece of Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari, and Shahnawaz Bhutto. Her father was killed by the police in 1996 in Karachi during the premiership of his sister, Benazir Bhutto. Her biological mother Fauzia Fasihudin unsuccessfully tried to gain parental custody of Bhutto. She lives with her stepmother in Old Clifton, Karachi.

Bhutto received her secondary education at the Karachi American School. She received a B.A. degree &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, majoring in Middle Eastern and Asian languages and cultures from Barnard College, an affiliated women&#x27;s liberal arts college of Columbia University, in New York, United States, in 2004. She received her M.A. in South Asian Studies from the SOAS, University of London in 2005, there she wrote her dissertation on the resistance movement in Pakistan.

==Career==
===Publications and politics===
In 1998, at the age of 15, Bhutto published her first book named &quot;Whispers of The Desert&quot;. Her second book &quot;8.50 a.m. 8 October 2005&quot; marks the moment of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake; it records accounts of those affected.

Bhutto&#x27;s family memoir &quot;Songs of Blood and Sword&quot; was published in 2010. In the book Bhutto accuses her aunt Benazir and her husband Asif Zardari for killing her father Murtaza. The book got mixed to negative reviews from critics for being biased on the history of her family. Several family members have accused her of falsifying information.

In November 2013, her first fictional novel &quot;The Shadow Of The Crescent Moon&quot; published. The book had been long-listed in 2014 for the Baileys Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction. In 2015 Bhutto&#x27;s short story titled &quot;Democracy&quot;, an e-book, under Penguin Books was released.

In 2019, her second novel, &quot;The Runaways&quot; was published. The book explores three young Muslim men&#x27;s journey to radicalization. The novel received critical acclaim for its subject. In October of the same year , &quot;New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K-Pop&quot; was published. Tash Aw in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described it as a &quot;razor-sharp, intriguing introduction to the various pop phenomena emerging from Asia.&quot;

Following the assassination of her aunt, Benazir Bhutto in 2007, there was speculation over her entrance into politics. In an interview, she has stated that for now she prefers to remain active through her activism and writing, rather than through elected office and that she has to &quot;rule a political career out entirely because of the effect of dynasties on Pakistan&quot;, referring to the Bhutto family dynasty and its ties to Pakistani politics. Although Bhutto is politically active, she is not affiliated with any political party.

Bhutto also mentors several South Asian writers as the Head of Climate Projects at the SouthAsia Speaks Literary Fellowship

==Personal life==
In 2009, it was reported that she was in a relationship with George Clooney, but neither she nor Clooney ever confirmed their relationship.

On April 27, 2023, Bhutto married Graham Byra, who adopted the name Gibran following his conversion to Islam. The ceremony was held in Fatima&#x27;s ancestral home in Karachi. Byra holds a Master of Arts in organizational psychology from Columbia University.

<text> (992–1071) was a Japanese court noble. He succeeded his father Michinaga to the position of Sesshō in 1017, and then went on to become Kampaku from 1020 until 1068. In both these positions, he acted as Regent to the Emperor, as many of his ancestors and descendants did; the Fujiwara clan had nearly exclusive control over the regency positions for over 200 years.
Prior to succeeding to the position of Regent, Yorimichi had held the title of &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (Minister of the Center/Palace Minister, second rank range), the lowest level of state ministers. By edict, he was raised above his colleagues, to the title of &quot;Ichi no Hito&quot;, or First Subject. In addition to the reason of direct succession from his father, this edict was presumably necessary to allow Yorimichi to become Sesshō.
He is also known as the founder of Byōdō-in phoenix hall, located in Uji.

In 1072, he ordained as a Buddhist monk and took the Dharma name Rengekaku (蓮華覚), later changed to Jakukaku (寂覚).

==Marriages and children==

* Princess Takahime, daughter of Imperial Prince Tomohira (son of Emperor Murakami) and Princess Nakahime; married 1009; no children, but they adopted 2 daughters:
** Princess Genshi (Motoko), (1016–1039), daughter of Imperial prince Atsuyasu (eldest son of Emperor Ichijō) and Princess Naka no Kimi (Takahime&#x27;s younger sister); Empress of Emperor Go-Suzaku
** Fujiwara no Kanshi (Hiroko), (1036–1121), daughter of Yorimichi by Fujiwara no Gishi
* A daughter of Minamoto no Norisada (a grandson of Emperor Murakami):
** Fujiwara no Michifusa (1024–1044)
* Fujiwara no Gishi (Masako), (died 1053) daughter of Fujiwara no Yorinari (a son of Imperial Prince Tomohira and Princess Nakahime, adopted by Fujiwara no Koresuke) and a daughter of Fujiwara no Korenori; she was then a niece of Princess Takahime:
** Priest Kakuen (1031–1098)
** Fujiwara no Kanshi (Hiroko), (1036–1121); adopted by Princess Takahime; Empress of Emperor Go-Reizei

<doc id="1328483" wikidata="Q95722" url="?curid=1328483" title="Fritz Fiedler">
<text>Fritz Fiedler (born Potsdam 9 January 1899: died Schliersee 8 July 1972), was an automotive engineer. His projects included the BMW 328 sports car, the ex-BMW Bristol straight-six engine, and the BMW New Class sedan.

==Career to 1945==
Fiedler began his career in engineering at Stoewer and moved to Horch in 1924, where he eventually became chief engineer. He designed 8-cylinder and 12-cylinder cars at Horch. He left in 1932 when Horch became part of Auto Union. He then went to BMW on the recommendation of his former assistant Rudolf Schleicher, who had joined Horch from BMW in 1927 and returned to BMW in 1931. Fiedler became chief engineer at the age of 32 over former chief engineer Alfred Böning who became head of the automotive drawing office.

In 1933 Fiedler was given the project to design the M78 six-cylinder engine for the BMW 303. The first car that Fiedler was fully responsible for was the BMW 326 saloon that was shown at the International Automobile Ausstellung in Berlin in 1936.

While Schleicher was at Munich on motorcycle development and the competition side of BMW motor car activity, Fiedler was at Eisenach in overall command of the car side of BMW, specialising in chassis, suspension and aerodynamic design and development. His last automotive design from Eisenach was the 3.5-litre 6 cylinder BMW 335 saloon, a fine 90 mph car for the German autobahns. During the war he was occupied with military vehicle design and development and finished up at Munich, so that after the war he was in the American zone. During the war he was a Director of BMW, but left the board in 1945.

==In England==
In 1947 Fiedler joined AFN Ltd at the persuasion of H.J. Aldington. Although he was lent to Bristol as a consultant on their Type 400 project, he did most of his work in England at Isleworth, where he was always known as Dr Fiedler, although he did not have that title in Germany. He was very popular with the workforce at AFN, most people describing him as a kindly and charming man, and everyone admired his engineering qualities. He took charge of the development of the post-war Frazer Nash, dealing with chassis, suspension, body design and construction and development of the FNS Bristol engine. On the Isleworth dynamometer he got over 100 bhp from the Bristol engine before the Bristol men did.

==Return to Germany and BMW==

After three years with AFN Ltd, Fiedler returned to Germany. He returned to BMW as chief engineer in 1952 after working at Opel for a short time. He took over responsibility for the ongoing V8 engine project and was responsible for the BMW 503 and BMW 507. He was chairman of BMW AG from 1955 to 1956 and he finally retired in 1966, after a long and active life devoted to BMW, but he attended the firm each day as a consultant for a further two years and died in 1972.

<text>The Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), also spelled Maasai giraffe, and sometimes called the Kilimanjaro giraffe, is a species or subspecies of giraffe. It is native to East Africa. The Masai giraffe can be found in central and southern Kenya and in Tanzania. It has distinctive jagged, irregular leaf-like blotches that extend from the hooves to its head. The Masai giraffe is currently the national animal of Tanzania.

==Taxonomy==
The IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies The Masai giraffe was described and given the binomial name &quot;Giraffa tippelskirchi&quot; by German zoologist Paul Matschie in 1898, but current taxonomy refers to Masai giraffe as &quot;Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi&quot;. The Masai giraffe was named in honor of Herr von Tippelskirch, who was a member of a German scientific expedition in German East Africa to what is now northern Tanzania in 1896. Tippelskirch brought back the skin of a female Masai giraffe from near Lake Eyasi which was later on identified as &quot;Giraffa tippelskirchi&quot;. Alternative taxonomic hypotheses have proposed Masai giraffe may be its own species.

==Description==
The Masai giraffe is distinguished by jagged and irregular spots on its body. Its geographic range includes various parts of eastern Africa. It is the largest-bodied giraffe species, making it the tallest land animal on Earth. Bulls are generally larger and heavier than cows, weighing close to 1,300 kilograms (2,900 pounds) and growing up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) in height. In the wild, individuals can live to be around 30 years of age, and in most cases can live longer in captivity. The Masai giraffe&#x27;s most famous feature, its neck, contains seven vertebrae and makes up roughly one third of its body height. Its long and muscular tongue, which can be up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length, is prehensile and allows it to grab leaves from tall trees that are inaccessible to other animals. The tongue&#x27;s darker pigment is believed to function as a natural sunscreen and prevent sunburn. On top of the head are two bony structures called ossicones which are covered by thick skin and have dark hair on the tips. These can be used during fights to club its opponent. Bulls usually have an extra ossicone present between the eyes. When galloping, the Masai giraffe has been recorded to reach speeds of almost 64 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour).

==Conservation==
Masai giraffes are considered endangered by the IUCN, and the Masai giraffe population declined 52% in recent decades due to poaching and habitat loss. The population amounts to 32,550 in the wild. Demographic studies of wild giraffes living inside and outside protected areas suggest low adult survival outside protected areas due to poaching and low calf survival inside protected areas due to predation; these are the primary influences on population growth rates. Survival of giraffe calves is influenced by the season of birth and the seasonal local presence or absence of long-distance migratory herds of wildebeest and zebra. Metapopulation analysis indicated protected areas were important for keeping giraffes in the larger landscape. 

&quot;In situ&quot; conservation of Masai giraffes is being done by several government agencies, including the Kenya Wildlife Service, Tanzania National Parks, Zambia Wildlife Authority; and non-governmental organizations including PAMS Foundation and the Wild Nature Institute. Community-based wildlife conservation areas have also been shown to be effective at protecting giraffes. 

Over 100 Masai giraffe live under human care in AZA accredited zoos in the United States. At several zoos, Masai giraffe cows have become pregnant and successfully given birth. 

Masai giraffes can suffer from giraffe skin disease, which is a disorder of unknown etiology that causes lesion on the forelimbs. This disorder is being further investigated to better understand mortality in this species.

<doc id="1328496" wikidata="Q2665381" url="?curid=1328496" title="Northern Dimension">
<text>The Northern Dimension (ND) is a joint policy between four equal partners – the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland – regarding the cross-border and external policies geographically covering Northwest Russia, the Baltic Sea and the Arctic regions, including the Barents Region. The ND Policy was initiated in 1999 and renewed in 2006. The Northern Dimension addresses the specific challenges and opportunities arising in those regions and aims to strengthen dialogue and cooperation between the EU and its member states, the northern countries associated with the EU under the European Economic Area (Norway and Iceland) and Russia. A particular emphasis is placed on subsidiarity, and on ensuring the active participation of all stakeholders in the North, including regional organizations, local and regional authorities, the academic and business communities, and civil society.

==Key priority themes==
Several key priority themes for dialogue and co-operation under the Northern Dimension have been identified:
* Economy, business and infrastructure
* Human resources, education, culture, scientific research, and health
* The environment, nuclear safety, and natural resources
* Cross-border cooperation and regional development
* Justice and home affairs

==Partnerships==
The working method for cooperation within the Northern Dimension is the partnerships model. ND cooperation takes place within four partnerships:
# Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP)
# Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being (NDPHS)
# Northern Dimension Partnership on Transport and Logistics (NDPTL) and
# Northern Dimension Partnership on Culture (NDPC).

Other kinds of activities are pursued through the Northern Dimension Institute (NDI) and the Northern Dimension Business Council (NDBC).
From the beginning of 2019, the Northern Dimension Institute led by the Aalto University&#x27;s Center for markets in Transition (CEMAT) is leading an EC co-funded NDI Think Tank Action.

== Objectives ==
The Northern Dimension is intended to promote security and stability in the region, as well as helping build a safe, clean, and accessible environment for all people in the north. It aims at addressing the special regional development challenges of northern Europe. These include cold climatic conditions, long distances, wide disparities in standards of living, environmental challenges including problems with nuclear waste and wastewater management, and insufficient transport and border crossing facilities. The Northern Dimension is also intended to take advantage of the rich potential of the region, for example in terms of natural resources, economic dynamism, and a rich cultural heritage.

Besides, the Northern Dimension also has the objectives of addressing the challenges arising from uneven regional development, and helping avoid the emergence of new dividing lines in Europe following EU enlargement.

With the enlargement of the Union on 1 May 2004 to include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, the importance of the Northern Dimension has increased considerably: eight EU Member States (Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Sweden) surround the Baltic Sea, and the EU&#x27;s shared border with Russia has lengthened.

== History ==
Recent years have seen far-reaching changes in the geopolitical map of northern Europe. The Baltic States regained their independence in 1991. Finland and Sweden joined the EU in 1995, and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in 2004. These events greatly increased the Northern and Baltic &quot;presence&quot; of the EU, and substantially lengthened the common border shared by the EU and the Russian Federation. It was imperative to address constructively the new challenges and opportunities which these changes created.

The Northern Dimension as an important topic for EU policy was first recognized at the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997. In the years which followed, the concept became more concrete. The Vienna European Council in December 1998 adopted a Commission Communication on a &quot;Northern Dimension for the policies of the Union&quot;. Six months later, in Cologne, the European Council adopted &quot;Guidelines for the Implementation of the Northern Dimension&quot;. In November 1999, the Finnish EU Presidency held a Ministerial Conference on the Northern Dimension, where an Inventory of current activities under the Northern Dimension was adopted. The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 invited the commission to prepare a Northern Dimension Action Plan, and the Feira European Council in June 2000 subsequently adopted this first &quot;Action Plan for the Northern Dimension in the external and cross-border policies of the European Union, 2001-2003&quot;.

Also a new dimension of this complex relationship is emerging with the melting of the Arctic because of climate change. Melting of sea ice leads to newly accessible natural resources which could cause power struggle.

<text>Walter William Read (23 November 1855 - 6 January 1907) was an English cricketer. A fluent right hand bat, he was also an occasional bowler of lobs who sometimes switched to quick overarm deliveries. He captained England in two Test matches, winning them both. Read was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1893.

==Cricket career==
Read took part in the original Ashes series of 1882–3 and is commemorated by the poem inscribed on the side of the urn:

:&quot;When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;&quot;
:&quot;Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return;&quot;
:&quot;The welkin will ring loud,&quot;
:&quot;The great crowd will feel proud,&quot;
:&quot;Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn;&quot;
:&quot;And the rest coming home with the urn.&quot;

He played for Surrey from 1873 to 1897, scoring 338 for them against Oxford University in 1888. At the time, it was the second highest first-class score ever made. He was a member of the side that won the County Championship in 1890-2, 1894 and 1895. After W. G. Grace he was the most prolific amateur of his day.

He became the first number 10 to score a hundred in Test cricket when he made 117 against Australia at The Oval in 1884. His match-saving innings remains the highest score by a No. 10 in Tests. He reached his century in 113 minutes with 36 scoring strokes. His partnership of 151 with William Scotton remains England&#x27;s highest for the ninth wicket against Australia. According to Sir Home Gordon, Read was furious at being held down so low in the order.

<doc id="1328501" wikidata="Q1130507" url="?curid=1328501" title="Hundred Days Offensive">
<text>The Hundred Days Offensive (8 August to 11 November 1918) was a series of massive Allied offensives that ended the First World War. Beginning with the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August) on the Western Front, the Allies pushed the Imperial German Army back, undoing its gains from the German spring offensive (21 March – 18 July).

The Germans retreated to the Hindenburg Line, but the Allies broke through the line with a series of victories, starting with the Battle of St Quentin Canal on 29 September. The offensive led directly to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 which ended the war with an Allied victory. The term &quot;Hundred Days Offensive&quot; does not refer to a planned Allied campaign, but rather the rapid series of Allied victories.

==Background==
The German spring offensive on the Western Front had begun on 21 March 1918 with Operation Michael and had petered out by July. The German Army had advanced to the River Marne, but failed to achieve their aim of a victory that would decide the war. When the German &quot;Operation Marne-Rheims&quot; ended in July, the Allied supreme commander, Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counter-offensive, which became known as the Second Battle of the Marne. The Germans, recognizing their untenable position, withdrew from the Marne to the north. For this victory, Foch was granted the title Marshal of France.

After the Germans had lost their forward momentum, Foch considered the time had arrived for the Allies to return to the offensive. General Pershing who commanded the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was keen to use his army as an independent force. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been reinforced by large numbers of troops returned from the Sinai and Palestine campaign and from the Italian front, and by replacements previously held back in Britain by Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

The military planners considered a number of proposals. Foch agreed to a proposal by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander-in-chief of the BEF, to strike on the River Somme, east of Amiens and south-west of the site of the 1916 Battle of the Somme, to force the Germans away from the vital Amiens–Paris railway. The Somme was chosen because it remained the boundary between the BEF and the French armies, along the Amiens–Roye road, allowing the two armies to cooperate. The Picardy terrain provided a good surface for tanks, unlike in Flanders, and the defences of the German 2nd Army under General Georg von der Marwitz were relatively weak, having been subjected to continual raiding by the Australians in a process termed peaceful penetration.

==Battles==

===Advance in Picardy===

====Battle of Amiens====
The Battle of Amiens (with the French attack on the southern flank called the Battle of Montdidier) opened on 8 August, with an attack by more than 10 Allied divisions—Australian, Canadian, British, and French forces—with more than 500 tanks. The mastermind of the plan was the Australian Lieutenant General John Monash. Through careful preparation, the Allies achieved surprise. The attack, led by the British Fourth Army, broke through the German lines, and tanks attacked German rear positions, sowing panic and confusion. By the end of the day, a gap wide had been created in the German line south of the Somme. The Allies had taken 17,000 prisoners and 339 guns. Total German losses were estimated to be 30,000 men, while the Allies had suffered about 6,500 killed, wounded and missing. The collapse in German morale led Erich Ludendorff to dub it &quot;the Black Day of the German Army&quot;.

The advance continued for three more days but without the spectacular results of 8 August, since the rapid advance outran the supporting artillery and ran short of supplies. During those three days, the Allies had managed to gain . Most of this was taken on the first day as the arrival of German reinforcements after this slowed the Allied advance. On 10 August, the Germans began to pull out of the salient that they had managed to occupy during Operation Michael in March, back towards the Hindenburg Line.

===Somme===

Haig refused to continue the attack and instead prepared to launch a fresh offensive by the Third Army at Albert (the Battle of Albert), which opened on 21 August. The offensive was a success, pushing the German 2nd Army back over a front. Albert was captured on 22 August. The attack was widened on the south, by the French Tenth Army starting the Second Battle of Noyon on 17 August, capturing the town of Noyon on 29 August. On 26 August, to the north of the initial attack, the First Army widened the attack by another with the Second Battle of Arras of 1918. Bapaume fell on 29 August (during the Second Battle of Bapaume).

===Advance to the Hindenburg Line===
With the front line broken, a number of battles took place as the Allies forced the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line. East of Amiens (after the Battle of Amiens), with artillery brought forward and munitions replenished, the Fourth Army also resumed its advance, with the Australian Corps crossing the Somme River on the night of 31 August, breaking the German lines during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin. On 26 August, to the north of the Somme, the First Army widened the attack by another with the Second Battle of Arras of 1918, which includes the Battle of the Scarpe (1918) (26 August) and the Battle of Drocourt-Queant Line (2 September).

South of the BEF, the French First Army approached the Hindenburg Line on the outskirts of St. Quentin during the Battle of Savy-Dallon (10 September), and the French Tenth Army approached the Hindenburg Line near Laon during the Battle of Vauxaillon (14 September). The British Fourth Army approached the Hindenburg Line along the St Quentin Canal, during the Battle of Épehy (18 September). By 2 September, the Germans had been forced back close to the Hindenburg Line from which they had launched their offensive in the spring.

===Battles of the Hindenburg Line===

Foch planned a series of concentric attacks on the German lines in France (sometimes referred to as the Grand Offensive), with the various axes of advance designed to cut German lateral communications, intending that the success of an attack would enable the entire front line to be advanced. The main German defences were anchored on the Hindenburg Line, a series of defensive fortifications stretching from Cerny on the Aisne river to Arras. Before Foch&#x27;s main offensive was launched, the remaining German salients west and east of the line were crushed at Havrincourt and St Mihiel on 12 September and at the Battle of Épehy and the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September.

The first attack of the Grand Offensive was launched on 26 September by the French and the AEF in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive (this offensive includes the battles of Somme-Py, Saint-Thierry, Montfaucon, and Chesne of 1 November). On 28 September, the Army Group under Albert I of Belgium (the Belgian Army, the British Second Army and the French Sixth Army), attacked near Ypres in Flanders (the Fifth Battle of Ypres). Both attacks made good progress initially but were then slowed by supply difficulties. The Grand Offensive involved attacking over difficult terrain, resulting in the Hindenburg Line not being broken until 17 October.

On 29 September, the central attack on the Hindenburg Line commenced, with the British Fourth Army (with British, Australian and American forces) attacking in the Battle of St Quentin Canal and the French First Army attacking fortifications outside St Quentin. By 5 October, the Allies had broken through the entire depth of the Hindenburg defences over a front. General Rawlinson wrote, &quot;Had the Boche [Germans] not shown marked signs of deterioration during the past month, I should never have contemplated attacking the Hindenburg line. Had it been defended by the Germans of two years ago, it would certainly have been impregnable….&quot;

On 8 October, the First and Third British Armies broke through the Hindenburg Line at the Second Battle of Cambrai. This collapse forced the German High Command to accept that the war had to be ended. The evidence of failing German morale also convinced many Allied commanders and political leaders that the war could be ended in 1918; previously, all efforts had been concentrated on building up forces to mount a decisive attack in 1919.

===Subsequent operations===
Through October, the German armies retreated through the territory gained in 1914. The Allies pressed the Germans back toward the lateral railway line from Metz to Bruges, which had supplied the front in northern France and Belgium for much of the war. As the Allied armies reached this line, the Germans were forced to abandon increasingly large amounts of heavy equipment and supplies, further reducing their morale and capacity to resist.

The Allied and German armies suffered many casualties. Rearguard actions were fought during the Pursuit to the Selle (9 October), battles of Courtrai (14 October), Mont-d&#x27;Origny (15 October), the Selle (17 October), Lys and Escaut (20 October) (including the subsidiary battles of the Lys and of the Escaut), the Serre (20 October), Valenciennes (1 November), the Sambre (including the Second Battle of Guise) (4 November), and Thiérache (4 November), and the Passage of the Grande Honnelle (5 November), with fighting continuing until the Armistice took effect at 11:00 on 11 November 1918. The last soldier to die was Henry Gunther, one minute before the armistice came into effect.

<text>Billy Timmins (born 1 October 1959) is an Irish former politician. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Wicklow constituency from 1997 until the 2016 general election. He was the deputy leader of Renua from the foundation of the party in March 2015 until May 2016. He previously sat as an Independent TD, having lost the Fine Gael parliamentary party whip in July 2013.
==Background==
Timmins was born in Baltinglass, County Wicklow. He was educated at Patrician College, Ballyfin, County Laois; at University College Galway where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Legal Science; and at the Military College, Curragh. Timmins served as an army officer, serving in Counties Galway, Donegal and Kilkenny and with the United Nations in Lebanon and Cyprus.

Timmins was first elected to Dáil Éireann for the Wicklow constituency at the 1997 general election, succeeding his father Godfrey Timmins who had retired. On his election to the Dáil, he became party spokesperson on Defence, Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Relief. He was elected to Wicklow County Council for the Baltinglass area in 1999 and served until 2004. In 2000 he became party spokesperson on Housing.

Following the 2002 general election he was appointed spokesperson on Agriculture and Food. In Enda Kenny&#x27;s front bench reshuffle in 2004 he received the Defence spokesperson portfolio. He was party spokesperson on Foreign Affairs from 2007 to 2010. In June 2010 he supported Richard Bruton&#x27;s leadership challenge to Enda Kenny. Following Kenny&#x27;s victory in a motion of confidence, Timmins was not re-appointed to the front bench. From October 2010 to March 2011 he was party deputy spokesperson on Social Protection with special responsibility for Pension and Welfare Reform.

Timmins was expelled from the Fine Gael parliamentary party on 2 July 2013 when he defied the party whip by voting against the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013. On 13 September 2013 he and six other expellees formed the Reform Alliance, most of whose supporters moved on to its successor Renua Ireland. He stood as a Renua candidate at the 2016 general election, but lost his seat. In May 2016, he announced his resignation from Renua.

Timmins rejoined the Fine Gael party in April 2018 and on 11 May 2018 was selected, along with Andrew Doyle and Simon Harris, to be a Fine Gael candidate for Wicklow for the next general election. He was an unsuccessful Fine Gael candidate for the Wicklow constituency at the 2020 general election.

<text>The counts of Toggenburg (&quot;Grafen von Toggenburg&quot;) ruled the Toggenburg region of today&#x27;s canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, and adjacent areas during the 13th to 15th centuries.

A baronial family of Toggenburg is mentioned in the 11th and 12th centuries, but their genealogical connection to the comital family is unclear. They are named for their ancestral seat, now known as &quot;Alt-Toggenburg&quot;, near Kirchberg, St. Gallen.
The castle was built in the 10th or 11th century, and was destroyed in 1085 in a conflict with the Abbot of St. Gallen, later rebuilt and in 1226 given to St. Gallen Abbey by count Diethelm of Toggenburg.

The family is attested from the early 13th century, as &quot;Toccanburg&quot;, later &quot;Tochimburc&quot;. Diethelm I (possible mention 1176, died 1205 or 1207) was followed by Diethelm II (possible mention 1210, died c. 1230). Either of these was the beneficiary of the inheritance of a number of local noble families (among these Alt-Rapperswil) in c. 1200 and adopted the title of &quot;comes&quot; (count) from 1209. In 1187, one Werner of Toggenburg became abbot of Einsiedeln.
The legend of a Saint Ida of Toggenburg is recorded in 1481, making her the wife of a count of Toggenburg, possibly either Diethelm, or one Heinrich. According to the legend, the husband defenestrated his innocent wife on suspicion of adultery. She survived and lived as an anchoress in Fischingen. Her veneration there is attested for 1410.

The early counts were in competition with St. Gallen Abbey, the bishops of Constance and the counts of Kyburg. The inheritance disputes motivated the donation of religious establishments in Bubikon, Rüti, Oberbollingen and Wurmsbach in the 1190s, and a fratricide by one Diethelm (fl. 1209–36) of his brother Rudolf in 1226.

On 23 April 1398 Count Donat von Toggenburg donated the church of Elsow as benefice for the new &quot;Allerheiligenaltar&quot; at the grave of the Toggenburg family, for the &quot;salvation of the soul of his daughter Menta von Toggenburg&quot; who had died shortly before. Count Fridrich von Toggenburg, Herr zu Brettengow und Tafas donated to &quot;his own and the salvation of his ancestors who were buried&quot; (at the Rüti church) &quot;and where he also expects to be buried,&quot; the church, rights and lands (&quot;Kirchwidem&quot; and &quot;Kirchensatz&quot;) in Wangen in der March to the Rüti Abbey, sealed by Fridrich and the knights Herman von Landenberg, Johans von Bonstetten from Ustra and Herman von der Hochenlandenberg on 21 January 1407.

In 1436, the death of the last count, Frederick VII, Count of Toggenburg, led to the Old Zurich War over the succession.
Friedrich VII was later buried in a chapel, the so-called &quot;Toggenburger Kapelle&quot; (&quot;capella nova in latere monasterii de novo construxit&quot;) given by his noble wife, Elisabeth Countess of Toggenburg, née von Mätsch. Elisabeth spent her last days in the Rüti Abbey, writing on 20 June 1442 that she had retreated there (&quot;unser wesen gentzlich in dasselbe gotzhus got zuo dienende gezogen habe&quot;) and desired her tomb to be with her husband&#x27;s. On 11 June 1443 marauding troops of the Old Swiss Confederacy devastated the monastery and desecrated the bodies of the nobles, including Count Friedrich VII whom they held responsible for the war with Zürich. 14 members of the family were buried in the Toggenburg vault in the church of the Rüti Abbey.

<text>A Cherenkov detector (pronunciation: /tʃɛrɛnˈkɔv/; Russian: Черенко́в) is a particle detector using the speed threshold for light production, the speed-dependent light output or the speed-dependent light direction of Cherenkov radiation.

==Fundamental==
A particle passing through a material at a velocity greater than that at which light can travel through the material emits light. This is similar to the production of a sonic boom when an airplane is traveling through the air faster than sound waves can move through the air. The direction this light is emitted is on a cone with angle θc about the direction in which the particle is moving, with cos(θc) =  (c = the vacuum speed of light, n = the refractive index of the medium, and v is the speed of the particle). The angle of the cone θc thus is a direct measure of the particle&#x27;s speed. The Frank–Tamm formula gives the number of photons produced.

==Aspects==
Most Cherenkov detectors aim at recording the Cherenkov light produced by a primary charged particle. Some sensor technologies explicitly aim at Cherenkov light produced (also) by secondary particles, be it incoherent emission as occurring in an electromagnetic particle shower or by coherent emission, for example Askaryan effect.

Cherenkov radiation is not only present in the range of visible light or UV light but also in any frequency range where the emission condition can be met i.e. in the radiofrequency range.

Different levels of information can be used. Binary information can be based on the absence or presence of detected Cherenkov radiation. The amount or the direction of Cherenkov light can be used.

In contrast to a scintillation counter the light production is instantaneous.

==Detector types==
In the simple case of a threshold detector, the mass-dependent threshold energy allows the discrimination between a lighter particle (which does radiate) and a heavier particle (which does not radiate) of the same energy or momentum. Several threshold stages can be combined to extend the covered energy range.

Cherenkov threshold detectors have been used for fast timing and time of flight measurements in particle detectors.

More elaborate designs use the amount of light produced. Recording light from both primary and secondary particles, for a Cherenkov calorimeter the total light yield is proportional to the incident particle energy.

Using the light direction are differential Cherenkov detectors.

Recording individual Cherenkov photon locations on a position-sensitive sensor area, RICH detectors then reconstruct Cherenkov angles from the recorded patterns. As RICH detectors hence provide information on the particle velocity, if the momentum of the particle is also known (from magnetic bending), combining these two pieces of information enables the particle mass to be deduced so that the particle type can be identified.

<doc id="1328523" wikidata="Q62344" url="?curid=1328523" title="Theodor Körner (author)">
<text>Carl Theodor Körner (23 September 1791 – 26 August 1813) was a German poet and soldier. After having lived for some time in Vienna, where he wrote some light comedies and other works for the Burgtheater, he became a soldier and joined the Lützow Free Corps in the German uprising against Napoleon. During this time, he displayed personal courage in many fights, and inspired his comrades by fiery patriotic lyrics he composed. One of these was the &quot;Schwertlied&quot; (), composed during a lull in fighting, only a few hours before his death, and &quot;Lützow&#x27;s wilde Jagd&quot;, each set to music by both Carl Maria von Weber and Franz Schubert. He was often called the &quot;German Tyrtaeus&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born at Dresden, capital of the Saxon electorate, the son of the consistorial councillor Christian Gottfried Körner and his wife Minna Stock Körner. He was raised by his parents and by his aunt, the artist Dora Stock, who lived in the home. He attended the Kreuzschule.

After his education, he chose mining as an occupation. He moved to Vienna, where he befriended Wilhelm von Humboldt, the Prussian ambassador; Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel; and other eminent literary and scientific men. Here, within the short space of fifteen months, he produced a succession of dramas, operas, and farces, as well as several small poems. The success of his works obtained him the appointment of poet to the court at the Vienna &quot;Burgtheater&quot;. It was in this period of his life that he became betrothed to the popular actress Antonie Adamberger. In Vienna, he also met Franz Grillparzer and Ludwig van Beethoven. Körner was writing a libretto to an opera specifically for Beethoven to compose but he died before completing it and sending the text to Beethoven.

During the War of the Sixth Coalition, he left Vienna in March 1813, and together with Friedrich Friesen and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn joined the Lützow Free Corps, a voluntary paramilitary association which Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow was then forming in Breslau, Silesia. On his way from Vienna to Breslau, he noticed a Prussian border eagle in the area of Neustadt, which inspired him to write a poem, &quot;Der Grenzadler&quot; (). In the midst of the most active campaigns, Körner continued to write poetry and other works. He wrote a singspiel, &quot;Der vierjährige Posten&quot;, which was set to music by Franz Schubert in 1815, but the piece was not performed until 1869, when it was staged at the Hofoper, Dresden. It was later adapted in English as &quot;The Outpost&quot;.

==Napoleonic Wars==
Having taken up quarters at Zobten, on 28 March 1813 Major von Lützow had determined on setting out on an expedition to Saxony and Thuringia, with four squadrons of his cavalry, and fifty cossacks. Körner arrived at Dresden on 6 April, taking the occasion to visit his family. In Leipzig, the Free Corps missed the opportunity to participate in the battles of Möckern and Lützen. Major von Lützow marched northwards, then, hearing of the French retreat from Hamburg, again turned to the south. Körner was frustrated, but earnestly entreated permission to accompany him, and his desire was fulfilled when he was appointed adjutant by Lützow, who highly esteemed him, and wished to have him near his person.

They marched from Halberstadt via Eisleben, Buttstädt to Schleiz, and finally reached Eichigt near Plauen in Vogtland within a few days—not without encountering the enemy, who were dispersed throughout these districts, but, also, not without effecting some important results. Intelligence and information were procured, ammunition was captured, and prisoners were taken. As a result, Napoleon was determined to destroy the corps, and the 1813 armistice provided an opportunity for putting it in practice.

Major von Lützow had received official information of the armistice concluded at Plauen on 4 June. Without expecting to meet with any opposition, he chose the shortest route to rejoin the infantry of his corps, having received assurance of safety from the enemy&#x27;s commanding officers, and proceeded, without interruption, back to Kitzen near Leipzig; but here he found himself surrounded and menaced by a very superior force. Körner was despatched to demand an explanation; but, instead of replying, the French General François Fournier-Sarlovèze struck at him with his sword, and ordered a general attack be made on the three squadrons of the Lützow cavalry. Several were wounded and taken, and others dispersed in the surrounding country; but Major von Lützow himself was saved by the assistance of a squadron of Uhlans, who had been in advance with the Cossacks. He reached, with a considerable number of his troops, the right bank of the Elbe, where the infantry of his corps, and a squadron of its cavalry, were already collected.

Körner had received the first blow, which he was not prepared to parry, as he approached the enemy&#x27;s commanding officer to deliver his message, and was severely wounded in the head. He managed to escape on his horse to a nearby forest. After he had assisted a wounded comrade, he noticed an enemy troop that was in pursuit of him, and called with a loud voice, &quot;Fourth squadron,—Advance!&quot; His ruse succeeded—the enemy drew back, and he was able to retreat farther into the forest. The pain of his head wound had become very severe. It was in this position that he composed the sonnet &quot;Abschied vom Leben&quot; (), of which the following is a translation:

During the night he heard the enemy searching the forest near him, but afterwards fell asleep, and was saved in the morning by two peasants. He was conveyed secretly into Leipzig, which was then under French control, and where the concealment of any of the Lützow Free Corps was prohibited, under severe punishment. Guided to Gnandstein Castle and later to Carlsbad in Bohemia, he subsequently travelled to Berlin, and having recovered from his wound, rejoined the Lützow corps in Mecklenburg.

==Death==
Hostilities recommenced on 17 August 1813; Körner spent the night of 25 August at Gottesgabe manor, where he played the piano and sang. In the early morning of the next day, an engagement took place at the nearby forest of Rosenow near Gadebusch, in which Körner fell. He had been in pursuit of a group of the enemy, when the riflemen, who had found a rallying-place in some under-wood, sent forth a shower of balls upon their pursuers. By one of these Körner was wounded in the abdomen, the liver and spine were injured, and he was immediately deprived of speech and consciousness. He was carried to a neighbouring wood, but could not be revived. He was buried under an oak in the village of Wöbbelin, about 8.5 km from Ludwigslust. A tomb has since been placed over his remains, and enclosed by a wall. Körner died at the age of twenty-one. His &quot;Poetischer Nachlass&quot; were edited by his father and published at Leipzig in 1815.

According to J.R. Miller in &quot;Homemaking&quot; (now published as &quot;The Family&quot;), Körner had a very close friendship with his sister Emma, and when he died, &quot;she survived him only long enough to complete his portrait and to draw with the pencil of love a sketch of his last resting-place.&quot; (In fact, Emma Körner survived her brother by two years, dying of a fever in Dresden four weeks after a visit to her brother&#x27;s grave. She was buried next to him in Wöbbelin.) Miller quotes a poem by &quot;Mrs. Hemans&quot; about their mutual devotion.

==Works==

His first volume of poems was published under the title of &quot;Knospen&quot; (, 1810). Of his light comedies, &quot;Die Braut&quot; (, 1812) and &quot;Der grüne Domino&quot; (, 1812) were very successful, and &quot;Der Nachtwächter&quot; (, 1812) was notable as was &quot;Sword Song&quot;. The drama &quot;Zriny&quot;, an historical tragedy, is the most ambitious of his works. Many of the poems from his years in the Lützow Free Corps were set to music by Carl Maria von Weber and Franz Schubert.

A selection of his battle songs was prepared by his father and published under the title of &quot;Leyer und Schwerdt&quot; (modern &quot;Leier und Schwert&quot;, ) (Berlin, 1814). His complete works were published by the direction of his mother, and edited by Streckfuss (1 vol., Berlin, 1834; 4 vols., 1838).

The Italian poet and novelist Alessandro Manzoni dedicated his ode &quot;Marzo 1821&quot; to Theodor Körner.

==Bibliography==
His &quot;Life, written by his Father, with his Selections from his Poems, Tales, and Dramas&quot;, translated from the German by G. F. Richardson, appeared in London in 1845. Biographical and critical studies are by Bauer (Stuttgart, 1883), Rogge (Wittenberg, 1891), Kregenberg (Dresden, 1892), Jaden, (Dresden, 1896), Peschel and Wildenow (Leipzig, 1898) and Peschel (Dresden, 1901).

<doc id="1328529" wikidata="Q886498" url="?curid=1328529" title="Eastern bluebonnet">
<text>The eastern bluebonnet (Northiella haematogaster), also known as the greater bluebonnet, is an Australian parrot, one of two species in the genus &quot;Northiella&quot;. It was originally included in the genus &quot;Psephotus&quot; but due to distinctive physical and behavioural differences was reclassified into its own genus in 1994 by ornithologists and taxonomists Christidis and Boles. The bluebonnet is a medium-sized inland parrot commonly found in the interior of southeastern and central-southern Australia. It is adapted to life in semi-arid regions but can also flourish in regions of medium rainfall towards the eastern and southern extremities of its range.

==Taxonomy==
Once included in the genus &quot;Psephotus&quot; the eastern bluebonnet has been placed in its own genus due to its significant physical and behavioural differences form other members of &quot;Psephotus&quot;. Throughout its range three distinctive subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;Northiella haematogaster haematorrhous&quot; – commonly known as the red-vented bluebonnet is found in the northeast of the species range.
* &quot;Northiella haematogaster haematogaster&quot; – commonly known as the yellow-vented bluebonnet is found in the central north of the species range between &quot;N. h. haematorrhous&quot; and &quot;N. h. pallescens&quot;.
* &quot;Northiella haematogaster pallescens&quot; – commonly known as the pallid bluebonnet is found in the extreme northwest of the species range.

A fourth has been once again classified as a separate species, the Naretha bluebonnet.

Where each subspecies overlaps there is a substantial amount of integration between the subspecies.

==Description==
The eastern bluebonnet is a medium-sized parrot with prominent crest-like head feathers. All bluebonnets have a mostly olive-grey to brown upperbody, foreneck and breast, with the outerwing and leading edge to the folded wing being dark blue, a blue forehead and face. The bill is pearl grey, the cere is light grey, iris colour is brown-grey, and the feet and legs are dark grey. There is no seasonal variation in the plumage and there are no similar looking species to the bluebonnet parrot.

Body length – Male – 28–35 cm, Female – 26–32 cm

Wingspan – Male – 36–42 cm, Female 34–38 cm

Weight – 70-100g

Each subspecies displays significant geographical variation in plumage and size. Most differ by the amount of red on the underbody and the pattern of the inner upperwing which varies from olive-yellow with a blue carpal patch and little or no red to mostly red with a blue-green carpal patch.

Subspecies descriptions – differences from nominate species

* &quot;N. h. haematorrhous&quot; – the red of underbody covers the entire undertail and coverts area. On the folded wing the shoulder patch is mostly red and the leading edge is a much lighter blue-green around the carpal joint.
* &quot;N. h. haematogaster&quot; – the lower underparts are yellow with a variable amount of red on the abdomen with a yellowish-olive wing patch.
* &quot;N. h. pallescens&quot; – paler, showing much less contrast between the breast and pale yellow of the underbelly.

Adult female – the sexes differ slightly with the females being slightly duller with less red on the belly than males. Females often also have a narrow off-white band across the underside of the inner primaries but this is not always present.

Juvenile – similar to the adult female but slightly duller and usually have less red on the belly. The most distinctive feature of juvenile&#x27;s is the brownish-orange colour of the bill which will become the pearl-grey adult colour within two months of fledging. Juvenile&#x27;s will attain adult plumage when they moult at about three to four months of age.

Call – harsh &#x27;chack chack&#x27;, flute like &#x27;cloote&#x27; and a loud &#x27;yak-yak-yak&#x27;.

==Distribution==
Bluebonnets are found in the interior of southeastern and central-southern Australia. The range extends from northern Victoria to southern Queensland in the east across to southeastern Western Australia in the west. Subspecies are found in distinct areas of the distribution of the bluebonnet as follows:

* &quot;N. h. haematorrhous&quot; – south Queensland to northern New South Wales.
* &quot;N. h. haematogaster&quot; – west and south New South Wales and northwest Victoria to southeast South Australia.
* &quot;N. h. pallescens&quot; – inland South Australia, the Lake Eyre Basin.

===Movements===
Bluebonnets are considered to be resident and sedentary or locally nomadic with no large scale seasonal or regular long-distance movements occurring.

==Habitat==
Bluebonnets inhabit arid and semi-arid zones in Australia. They inhabit open woodlands dominated by false sandalwood, (&quot;Myoporum&quot;), belah &quot;Casuarina cristata&quot;, native pine &quot;Callitris&quot;, western myall, gidgee, and mulga &quot;Acacia&quot;, and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, often with a low shrub layer of chenopods such as saltbush &quot;Atriplex&quot; or blue bush &quot;Maireana&quot;. Bluebonnets will also inhabit open grassy plains, scrub, and trees bordering watercourses. Remnant patches of mallee in northern Victoria are also important habitat areas for birds in the south of their range.

==Diet==
Bluebonnets feed mostly on the ground on the seed of native and introduced grasses, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs as well as foraging on fruit, berries, vegetable matter, flowers, nectar, insects and their larvae and in arid areas the seeds and fruit of the saltbush.

All bluebonnets mainly drink at dawn and dusk and are cautious when approaching water.

==Social behaviour==
Bluebonnets are usually found in pairs or small groups of under ten birds. Pairs separate to breed in late winter before rejoining the flock in late spring with their young.
When flushed bluebonnets will quickly leave the ground whistling their call notes while on the wing. They will fly to a nearby tree where they will fall silent and adopt an erect posture to inspect the intruder awaiting the opportunity to return to the ground.
Bluebonnets fly with an undulating, sometimes jerky gait generally below tree-top levels.

==Breeding==
Bluebonnets normally breed between August and January but this can start earlier or run later in response to prolonged periods of rainfall. During his courtship display the male bluebonnet will raise and lower his &#x27;crest&#x27;, stretch his neck, vibrate his partly raised wings and move his fanned tail from side to side. Bluebonnets form monogamous pairs and will normally only breed once a year but in years with abundant rainfall have been known to breed twice in one season.
The nest site is selected and prepared by both the male and female and is often in a hollow in the trunk or limb of a tree, living or dead with a small entrance hole. Usually four to seven white oval eggs will be laid on a layer of decaying wood dust on the bottom of the nesting cavity. Only the female incubates the eggs and is fed by the male during this time. Incubation lasts approximately nineteen days and chicks hatch covered in white down. The female continues to brood the chicks alone but the male participates in feeding the chicks with the hen. Chicks fledge the nest at about thirty days old and continue to be fed by the parents until they are independent at about 12 days after they have fledged. The family will then rejoin the flock.

==Aviculture==
The bluebonnet is a moderately common species in the wild though not so in captivity as they are often regarded as being drab, noisy, extremely aggressive and poor breeders.

<doc id="1328536" wikidata="Q552813" url="?curid=1328536" title="C. Aubrey Smith">
<text>Sir Charles Aubrey Smith (21 July 1863 – 20 December 1948) was an English Test cricketer who became a stage and film actor, acquiring a niche as the officer-and-gentleman type, as in the first sound version of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937). In Hollywood, he organised British actors into a cricket team, much intriguing local spectators.

==Early life==
Smith was born in London, England, to Charles John Smith (1838–1928), a medical doctor, and Sarah Ann (&quot;née&quot; Clode, 1836–1922). His sister, Beryl Faber (died 1912), was married to Cosmo Hamilton.

Smith was educated at Charterhouse School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He settled in South Africa to prospect for gold in 1888–89. While there he developed pneumonia and was wrongly pronounced dead by doctors. He married Isabella Wood in 1896.

==Cricket career==

As a cricketer, Smith was primarily a right arm fast bowler, though he was also a useful right-hand lower-order batsman and a good slip fielder. His oddly curved bowling run-up, which started from deep mid-off, earned him the nickname &quot;Round the Corner Smith&quot;. When he bowled round the wicket his approach was concealed from the batsman by the umpire until he emerged, leading W. G. Grace to comment &quot;it is rather startling when he suddenly appears at the bowling crease.&quot; He is widely regarded as one of the very best amateur bowlers of his day. He played for [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University] (1882–1885) and for [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at various times from 1882 to 1892.

While in South Africa he captained the [[Johannesburg]] English XI. He [[English cricket team|captained England]] to victory in his only [[Test cricket|Test match]], against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] at [[Port Elizabeth]] in March 1889, taking five wickets for nineteen runs in the first innings. The English team who played were by no means representative of the best players of the time and nobody at the time realised that the match would enter the cricket records as an official Test match. His home club for much of his career was West Drayton Cricket club. Actors would arrive from London to the purpose-built train station in West Drayton and taken by horse-drawn carriage to the ground.

In 1932, he founded the [[Hollywood Cricket Club]] and created a pitch with imported English grass. He attracted fellow expatriates such as [[David Niven]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Nigel Bruce]] (who served as captain), [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and [[Boris Karloff]] to the club as well as local American players. Smith&#x27;s stereotypical Englishness spawned several amusing anecdotes: while fielding at slip for the Hollywood Club, he dropped a difficult catch and ordered his English butler to fetch his spectacles; they were brought on to the field on a silver platter. The next ball looped gently to slip, to present the kind of catch that &quot;a child would take at midnight with no moon.&quot; Smith dropped it and, snatching off his lenses, commented, &quot;Damned fool brought my reading glasses.&quot; Decades after his cricket career had ended, when he had long been a famous face in films, Smith was spotted in the pavilion on a visit to [[Lord&#x27;s]]. &quot;That man over there seems familiar&quot;, remarked one member to another. &quot;Yes&quot;, said the second, seemingly oblivious to his Hollywood fame, &quot;Chap called Smith. Used to play for Sussex.&quot;

==Acting career==

Smith began acting on the [[West End theatre|London stage]] in 1895. His first major role was in &quot;[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|Prisoner of Zenda]]&quot; the following year, playing the dual lead roles of king and look-alike. Forty-one years later, he appeared in the [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|most acclaimed film version]] of the novel, this time as the wise old adviser. When [[Raymond Massey]] asked him to help him understand the role of Black Michael, he answered &quot;My dear Ray, in my time I have played every part in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; except Princess Flavia. And I always had trouble with Black Michael!&quot; He made his Broadway debut as early as 1895 in &quot;The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith&quot;. In 1907 he appeared with [[Marie Doro]] in &quot;The Morals of Marcus&quot;, a play Doro later made into a silent film. Smith later appeared in a revival of [[George Bernard Shaw]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]&quot; in the starring role of [[Pygmalion (play)|Henry Higgins]].

Smith appeared in early films for the nascent British film industry, starring in &quot;The Bump&quot; in 1920 (written by [[A. A. Milne]] for the company Minerva Films, which was founded in 1920 by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]]). Smith later went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] where he had a successful career as a character actor playing either officer or gentleman roles. One role in 1937 was as Colonel Williams in &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot;, starring [[Shirley Temple]], [[Victor McLaglen]], [[Cesar Romero]] and [[June Lang]]. He was regarded as being the unofficial leader of the British film industry colony in Hollywood, which [[Sheridan Morley]] characterised as the Hollywood Raj, a select group of British actors who were seen to be colonising the capital of the film business in the 1930s. Other film stars considered to be &quot;members&quot; of this select group were [[David Niven]] (whom Smith treated like a son), [[Ronald Colman]], [[Rex Harrison]], [[Robert Coote]], [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Nigel Bruce]] (whose daughter&#x27;s wedding he had attended as best man), [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] (whom Smith had known since working with him on early films in London), and [[Patric Knowles]].

Smith expected his fellow countrymen to report for regular duty at his [[Hollywood Cricket Club]]. Anyone who refused was known to &quot;incur his displeasure&quot;. Fiercely patriotic, Smith became openly critical of the British actors of enlistment age who did not return to fight after the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939. Smith loved playing on his status as Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Englishman in Residence&quot;. His bushy eyebrows, beady eyes, handlebar moustache, and height of 6&#x27;2&quot; made him one of the most recognisable faces in Hollywood.

Smith starred alongside leading ladies such as [[Greta Garbo]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Vivien Leigh]] as well as the actors [[Clark Gable]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], and [[Gary Cooper]]. His films include &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937), &quot;[[The Four Feathers (1939 film)|The Four Feathers]]&quot; (1939), Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]&quot; (1940), &quot;[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]&quot; (1941), &quot;[[And Then There Were None (1945 film)|And Then There Were None]]&quot; (1945) in which he played General Mandrake, and the 1949 remake of &quot;[[Little Women (1949 film)|Little Women]]&quot; starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Janet Leigh]], in which he portrayed the aged grandfather of Laurie Lawrence (played by a young [[Peter Lawford]]), who generously gives a piano to the frail Beth March (played by [[Margaret O&#x27;Brien]]). He also appeared as the father of [[Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan]] in &quot;[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]&quot;, the first Tarzan film with [[Johnny Weissmüller]]. Smith also played a leading role as the Earl of Dorincourt in [[David O. Selznick]]&#x27;s adaption &quot;[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]&quot; (1936).

He appeared in [[Dennis Wheatley]]&#x27;s 1934 thriller &quot;Such Power Is Dangerous&quot;, about an attempt to take over Hollywood, under the fictitious name of Warren Hastings Rook (rather than Charles Aubrey Smith). Author [[Evelyn Waugh]] leaned heavily on Smith in drawing the character of Sir Ambrose Abercrombie for Waugh&#x27;s 1948 satire of Hollywood &quot;[[The Loved One (book)|The Loved One]]&quot;. [[Commander McBragg]] in the TV cartoon &quot;[[Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales]]&quot; is a parody of him.

==Death==
Smith died of [[pneumonia]] at home in Beverly Hills on 20 December 1948, aged 85. He was survived by his wife and their daughter, Honor. His body was cremated and nine months later, in accordance with his instructions, the ashes were returned to England and interred in his mother&#x27;s grave at [[St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Aldrington|St Leonard&#x27;s churchyard]] in [[Hove]], [[Sussex]].

==Honours and awards==
Smith has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

Smith was an officer in the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]].

In 1933, he served on the first board of the [[Screen Actors Guild]].

He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1938 and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George VI]] in 1944 for services to Anglo-American amity.

<text>Ralph Trapnell Snelgrove (June 11, 1914 – March 27, 1990) was a Canadian radio and television pioneer who obtained one of the first television licences issued in Canada and built television station CKVR-TV in Barrie, Ontario.
Born in Newfoundland, Snelgrove was employed by Metropolitan Broadcasting in Toronto before becoming manager of AM radio station CFOS in Owen Sound, Ontario in 1940. He moved to Barrie to set up the town&#x27;s first radio station CKBB, which launched on August 31, 1949. Six years later, Snelgrove launched CKVR-TV with call letters representing his wife&#x27;s name and his own (Valerie and Ralph). In 1965, he founded Collingwood, Ontario&#x27;s first radio station, CKCB (AM). Snelgrove sold his television stations to Allan Waters in 1969 and became a director of Waters&#x27; company, CHUM Limited. He sold his radio stations to Kawartha Broadcasting in 1983.

Snelgrove was the first president of the Central Canada Broadcasters Association and served as president of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters in 1948. In politics, he served as an alderman in Barrie and was also a school trustee. As well, Snelgrove was president of the Greater Barrie Chamber of Commerce.

He received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario in 1981 and was inducted into the CAB Broadcast Hall of Fame in 1985. Snelgrove died in 1990 at age 75.
One of his sons is Timothy Snelgrove, founder of Timothy&#x27;s World Coffee.

<text>Yves Balasko is a French economist working in England. He was born in Paris on 9 August 1945 to a Hungarian father and a French mother. After studying mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris he became interested in economics. He subsequently spent six years at Électricité de France where he was involved in the application of the theory of marginal cost pricing to electricity pricing. While at Électricité de France, he proved his first results on the structure of the equilibrium manifold in the theory of general equilibrium. After completing his dissertation on &quot;L&#x27;équilibre économique du point de vue differentiel&quot; (English: &quot;The Economic equilibrium from the differential point of view&quot;), he had positions at the Universities of Paris XII, Paris I, Geneva and York. In 2013, he held a visiting scholar position at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. Since 2014, he has returned to York University.

He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1980. He is also a Vice President of the Society for Economic Measurement (SEM).

In mathematical economics, Balasko has worked on general equilibrium theory, the overlapping generations model and the theory of incomplete asset markets. In his research, Balasko uses topology.

<text>Cooking Vinyl is a British independent record label, based in Acton, London, England. It was founded in 1986 by former manager and booking agent Martin Goldschmidt and his business partner Pete Lawrence. Goldschmidt remains the current owner and chairman, while Rob Collins is managing director.

==History==
===1986–1992===
Cooking Vinyl was set up in 1986 by former manager and booking agent Martin Goldschmidt and distribution manager Pete Lawrence, who initially ran the business as a part-time venture out of a spare room in Goldschmidt&#x27;s council house in Stockwell, South London.

In 1986 Cooking Vinyl recorded an impromptu live performance around a campfire at a folk festival by the singer Michelle Shocked, on a Sony Walkman with fading batteries. One of its first releases, Cooking Vinyl released the recording as The Campfire Tapes, and it sold 250,000 copies worldwide.

In 1989, the company was close to bankruptcy when their distributors, Rough Trade, went into receivership. Pete Lawrence sold his stake in the business to Martin Goldschmidt who continued the business while servicing the debt of the company of a period of five years.

===1993–1999===
Besides traditional royalty agreements, Cooking Vinyl developed &#x27;artist services&#x27; deals in the 1990s, where the artist retains ownership of the copyright of their recorded material. The first of these contracts was done in 1993 for the reissue of Billy Bragg&#x27;s &quot;Back To Basics&quot; compilation. 

Since then, Bragg has re-engaged with Cooking Vinyl a total of six times, most recently in 2013 for the release of studio album &quot;Tooth And Nail&quot;.

Cooking Vinyl has provided similar services for Alison Moyet, Black Spiders, Gary Numan, James Skelly &amp; The Intenders, Madness, Pigeon Detectives, Reverend and The Makers, Ron Sexsmith, and The View.

===2000–2010===
In 2009, Cooking Vinyl partnered on the release of The Prodigy&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Invaders Must Die&quot;, which went on to sell 1.2 million units worldwide and was the biggest-selling independent record of the year in Europe.

In 2012, Amanda Palmer, an advocate of the DIY approach, announced that she was partnering with Cooking Vinyl in a distribution and label services deal for the European release of her studio album &quot;Theatre Is Evil&quot;. The album was funded through a high-profile Kickstarter campaign that raised over $1.2 million in 30 days.

Also released in 2012 was Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Born Villain&quot; under a joint-venture partnership between Manson&#x27;s own label Hell, etc. and Cooking Vinyl. The album was a global success charting at No. 5 in Germany, No. 10 in the US, and topping Billboard&#x27;s Hard Rock and Independent albums charts. In the UK, Manson reached No. 14 in the UK Albums Chart and No. 1 in the UK Rock Albums Chart.

===2011–2020===
2014 saw the return of Embrace and their self-titled album, which debuted in the UK Albums Chart at No. 5. In the same year, New York rockers The Pretty Reckless reached No. 8, with their second studio album.

In 2015, the Prodigy released their album &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;, which reached number 1 on the chart, and was certified gold in the UK.

In 2016, Passenger claimed the UK No. 1 album with &quot;Young As The Morning, Old As The Sea&quot;. This year also saw singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt sign a global artist services deal with Cooking Vinyl.

In 2018, Lucy Spraggan, former contestant on &quot;The X Factor&quot;, signed to both Cooking Vinyl Records and Publishing on a long-term global artist services deal.

Cooking Vinyl has long relationships with many of its artists. The Pixies&#x27; Charles Thompson was signed in 2000 and has had 17 releases to date with the label as Frank Black and Black Francis.

Since 1994, former Doll By Doll man Jackie Leven has had 23 releases, five of them in 2009.

Other artists that have released through the label in the 2010s include Counting Crows, Ryan Adams, Suzanne Vega, The Cult, The Charlatans, The Cranberries, Richard Ashcroft (CV licensed the Righteous Phonographic released album &quot;These People&quot;, with Ashcroft going on to be signed by BMG), The Subways, Echo and the Bunnymen, Gary Numan, The Enemy, Groove Armada, The Proclaimers, Seth Lakeman, UB40 and The Dropkick Murphys.

===2021–present===
In December 2021, Clare Grogan announced that the first Altered Images album in over 38 years would be released in August 2022 on Cooking Vinyl and called &quot;Mascara Streakz&quot;. The album has been recorded with Bobby Bluebell from The Bluebells and Bernard Butler, formally of Suede and McAlmont &amp; Butler.

As of December 2021, other artists signed to Cooking Vinyl include Alison Moyet, Eliza &amp; The Delusionals, Lissie, Nina Nesbitt, The Orb, Will Young, Passenger, The Waterboys, BABYMETAL, Fickle Friends, Lucy Spraggan, Rumer, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, The Darkness, The Psychedelic Furs, Billy Bragg, Del Amitri, Kiefer Sutherland, Reverend And The Makers, Suzanne Vega, The Fratellis, The Rifles, and Willy Mason

<text>Montague Parker Bowden (1 November 1865 – 19 February 1892) was an English first-class cricketer, a wicket-keeper, who played two Test matches against South Africa in 1888/89.

Bowden was born in Stockwell, Surrey, and educated at Dulwich College. Aged 23 years 144 days, he became England&#x27;s youngest captain on 25 March 1889, when he captained England to victory in the second of his two Tests. Bowden had been deputy to C. Aubrey Smith, but Smith missed the second test through illness.

Bowden stayed in South Africa to participate in the Witwatersrand Gold Rush, went to Rhodesia with the Pioneer Column, and ended up smuggling liquor. In 1892, he died in Umtali Hospital, Umtali, Rhodesia (now Mutare, Zimbabwe). Officially he died of epilepsy, although a fall from his cart, leading him to be trampled under the hooves of his own oxen contributed to his death. Umtali Hospital was nothing more than a glorified mud hut, where his body had to be protected from marauding lions, prior to being interred in a coffin made from whiskey cases.

<text>Pixies is an EP by the American alternative rock band of the same name, released in 2002 by SpinART Records in the U.S., Cooking Vinyl in the UK and Sonic Unyon in Canada. It consists of the remaining songs from the band&#x27;s original 17-track demo tape (known informally as The Purple Tape), eight songs of which were released in 1987 as the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;. All 17 songs were recorded by Gary Smith at Fort Apache Studios in March 1987. 

&quot;In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song)&quot; is a cover of a song featured in David Lynch&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Eraserhead&quot;.

==Track listing==

==&quot;The Purple Tape&quot;==
&quot;The Purple Tape&quot; was recorded in three days during the band&#x27;s first studio session in 1987. According to frontman Black Francis, the tape was initially recorded &quot;with the intention of releasing it as a record&quot;, and producer Gary Smith later stated that the songs were not thought of as demo recordings. The sessions were financed by Francis after borrowing $1,000 from his father (approx $2,760 in 2024).

===Songs===
The recordings were captured on two reels of tape and included two different takes of &quot;Rock a My Soul&quot;, as well as unspecified recordings labeled &quot;Leonard Norman acoustic number&quot; and &quot;The New One&quot;. 

&quot;Down to the Well&quot; and &quot;Rock a My Soul&quot; from this session were re-released in 1988 on the &quot;Sounds Waves 3&quot; EP, a 7-inch,  rpm record that also included tracks by the Wedding Present, the Pogues and the Sugarcubes which was given away with issues of &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine. 

Several of the tracks on the tape were re-recorded for later Pixies releases: &quot;I&#x27;m Amazed&quot;, &quot;Broken Face&quot;, and &quot;Break My Body&quot; (for &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;); &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; (&quot;Doolittle&quot;); a live version of &quot;In Heaven&quot; (&quot;Gigantic&quot; single); &quot;Down to the Well&quot; (&quot;Bossanova&quot;); &quot;Build High&quot; (&quot;Planet of Sound&quot; single); and a revised &quot;Subbacultcha&quot; (&quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;). 

The original &quot;Subbacultcha&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; both have sections that differ from later re-recordings. The removed chorus from &quot;Subbacultcha&quot; later appeared as the basis for &quot;Distance Equals Rate Times Time&quot;, a separate song immediately following the revised &quot;Subbacultcha&quot; on &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;.

===Artwork===
The cassette J-card features a photograph taken by producer Gary Smith of drummer David Lovering jogging naked in place at Fort Apache, composited with an image of project houses behind the studio.

<doc id="1328582" wikidata="Q5894701" url="?curid=1328582" title="Hong Kong Housing Authority">
<text>The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) is the main provider of public housing in Hong Kong. It was established in April 1973 under the Housing Ordinance and is an agency of the Government of Hong Kong. In the same year, the Resettlement Department and the Building Section of the Urban Services Department were merged to form the Housing Department, which acts as the Housing Authority&#x27;s executive body.

==History==
The modern Housing Authority was founded in 1973.

In 2005, most Housing Authority-owned shopping centres and car parks were controversially divested to The Link REIT.

A citywide scandal erupted in 2015 after heavy metals were found in the water supply of some housing estates, schools, and private residential buildings. The contamination was first identified at Kai Ching Estate, opened in 2013. A task force found that the contamination was caused by solder joints with high lead content.

== Responsibilities ==
Outside of public housing provision, the authority is also responsible for the management of public rental housing estates, interim housing estates, transit centres, demolished factories and ancillary commercial and non-domestic facilities such as shopping centres, market stalls and car parks. It also acts as the agent for the government when it comes to clearing land, and according to its own policy &quot;preventing squatting and implementing improvements in squatter areas.&quot;

Though most commercial assets of the Housing Authority were divested to the Link REIT in 2005, the Housing Authority still manages some shopping centres as well as 21 markets. There have been calls for the government to buy back the properties sold to the Link as rent increases have placed a financial burden on public housing residents.

== Composition ==
At the time of its creation, membership of the authority was made up as follows:
* Secretary of Housing (chairman)
* Eight Urban Councillors
* Five unofficial members
* Six official members
Currently, members are appointed by the Chief executive of Hong Kong. They are: the chairman, Vice-chairman, two official members and 26 non-official members.

== Roles ==
The Authority operates the Tenants Purchase Scheme, the Home Ownership Scheme and the Private Sector Participation Scheme. They were also formerly responsible for a loan scheme targeted at low-income home buyers, which provided interest-free loans of up to HK$530,000 or monthly mortgage subsidies of up to HK$3,800 to help low-income individuals or families buy their own flats.

More than 8,000 low-income families are subsidised, although the scheme was halted in 2003 pending a review. In June 2004, the definitive abolition of the scheme was announced.

In 2019, the 4,871 flats from six estates was largest number of subsidised homes put on the market since the Home Ownership Scheme was restarted in 2011;
But only 54 of 80 randomly selected buyers turned up – a low turnout rate that would have been unheard of in the past.

==Key people==
Since 1 July 2007, following a reorganisation of government agencies, the role of Chairman of the Housing Authority is held by the Secretary for Transport and Housing (a position created in 2007). This role was previously held by the Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands. The Director of Housing is vice-chairman of the HA.
Past and present Chairpersons of the Hong Kong Housing Authority have included:
* Winnie HO Wing-yin: 2022–present
* Frank Chan Fan: 2017–2022
* Anthony Cheung: 2012–2017
* Eva Cheng: 2007–2012
* Michael Suen: 2002–2007
* Dr. Cheng Hon-kwan: 2000–2002
* Dame Dr. Rosanna Wong Yick-ming: 1992–2000
* Sir David Akers-Jones: 1987–1992

== Location ==
The Hong Kong Housing Authority Headquarters are located at 33 Fat Kwong Street, Ho Man Tin, Kowloon. The Hong Kong Housing Authority Exhibition Centre is located nearby at 3/F, Homantin Plaza, 80 Fat Kwong Street.

<text>UTF-EBCDIC is a character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using 1 to 5 bytes (in contrast to a maximum of 4 for UTF-8). It is meant to be EBCDIC-friendly, so that legacy EBCDIC applications on mainframes may process the characters without much difficulty. Its advantages for existing EBCDIC-based systems are similar to UTF-8&#x27;s advantages for existing ASCII-based systems. Details on UTF-EBCDIC are defined in Unicode Technical Report #16.

To produce the UTF-EBCDIC encoded version of a series of Unicode code points, an encoding based on UTF-8 (known in the specification as UTF-8-Mod) is applied first (creating what the specification calls an I8 sequence). The main difference between this encoding and UTF-8 is that it allows Unicode code points through (the C1 control codes) to be represented as a single byte and therefore later mapped to corresponding EBCDIC control codes. In order to achieve this, UTF-8-Mod uses instead of as the format for trailing bytes in a multi-byte sequence. As this can only hold 5 bits rather than 6, the UTF-8-Mod encoding of codepoints above are larger than the UTF-8 encoding.

The UTF-8-Mod transformation leaves the data in an ASCII-based format (for example, &quot;A&quot; is still encoded as ), so each byte is fed through a reversible (one-to-one) lookup table to produce the final UTF-EBCDIC encoding. For example, in this table maps to ; thus the UTF-EBCDIC encoding of (Unicode&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;) is (EBCDIC&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;).

UTF-EBCDIC is rarely used, even on the EBCDIC-based mainframes for which it was designed. IBM EBCDIC-based mainframe operating systems, such as z/OS, usually use UTF-16 for complete Unicode support. For example, IBM Db2, COBOL, PL/I, Java and the IBM XML toolkit support UTF-16 on IBM mainframes.

== Codepage layout ==
There are 160 characters with single-byte encodings in UTF-EBCDIC (compared to 128 in UTF-8). As can be seen, the single-byte portion is similar to IBM-1047 instead of IBM-37 due to the location of the square brackets. CCSID 37 has [] at hex BA and BB instead of at hex AD and BD respectively.



== Oracle UTFE ==

&quot;Oracle UTFE&quot; is a Unicode 3.0 UTF-8 Oracle database variation, similar to the CESU-8 variant of UTF-8, where supplementary characters are encoded as two 4-byte characters rather than a single 4- or 5-byte character. It is used only on EBCDIC platforms.

<doc id="1328588" wikidata="Q427157" url="?curid=1328588" title="Metaphysis">
<text>The metaphysis (: metaphyses) is the neck portion of a long bone between the epiphysis and the diaphysis. It contains the growth plate, the part of the bone that grows during childhood, and as it grows it ossifies near the diaphysis and the epiphyses. The metaphysis contains a diverse population of cells including mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to bone and fat cells, as well as hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to a variety of blood cells as well as bone-destroying cells called osteoclasts. Thus the metaphysis contains a highly metabolic set of tissues including trabecular (spongy) bone, blood vessels, as well as marrow adipose tissue (MAT). 

The metaphysis may be divided anatomically into three components based on tissue content: a cartilaginous component (epiphyseal plate), a bony component (metaphysis) and a fibrous component surrounding the periphery of the plate. The growth plate synchronizes chondrogenesis with osteogenesis or interstitial cartilage growth with both appositional bone elongation in conjunction with growth in width, so bearing load and responding to local and systemic forces and factors balance one another mechanically.

During childhood, the growth plate contains the connecting cartilage enabling the bone to grow; at adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 25 years), the components of the growth plate stop growing altogether and completely ossify into solid bone. In an adult, the metaphysis functions to transfer loads from weight-bearing joint surfaces to the diaphysis.

==Clinical significance==
Because of their rich blood supply and vascular stasis, metaphyses of long bones are prone to hematogenous spread of osteomyelitis in children.

Metaphyseal tumors or lesions include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, fibrous dysplasia, simple bone cyst, aneurysmal bone cyst, non-ossifying fibroma, and osteoid osteoma.

One of the clinical signs of rickets that doctors look for is cupping and fraying at the metaphyses when seen on X-ray.

<text>Andrew Ernest Stoddart (11 March 1863 – 4 April 1915) was an English sportsman who played international cricket for England, and rugby union for England and the British Isles. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1893.

He has the unique distinction in captaining England in three distinct sports; cricket, rugby union and Australian rules football.

==Cricket career==

Born in Westoe, South Shields, County Durham, England, he was the youngest son of a wine merchant, who moved the whole family to Marylebone, London, in 1877. Stoddart made his reputation in club cricket and was playing for Middlesex by 1885. He was a flamboyant right-handed batsman and a right arm medium pace bowler. He played 16 Test matches captaining England in eight games of which he won three, lost four and drew one. His 173 at Melbourne in 1894–95 was, for 80 years, the highest score by an England captain in Test cricket in Australia. Stoddart was also the first England captain to ask Australia to bat first, and the first to declare a Test innings closed.

When he was 23, just a year after his first-class debut, he was toying with the idea of giving up his amateur career in England to join his brother in Colorado. His plans changed when he took the record for the highest ever score in cricket at the time with an innings of 485 for Hampstead against Stoics on 4 August 1886. No declarations were allowed in the game and the Stoics, living up to their name, fielded all day without a chance to bat. Stoddart was seventh out, having batted six hours and ten minutes and clubbed one eight, three fives, and 64 fours. The runs were scored at a rapid pace – the score was 370 for 3 at lunch after 150 minutes of play. He made 207 for Hampstead in the next match three days later and on 9 August was playing for Middlesex and made 98, a grand total of 790 runs in a week. Stoddart was a man with a great zest for life in his younger days. He had danced then played cards until dawn before the Stoics game, batted almost through Hampstead&#x27;s innings of 813, then played tennis, went to the theatre and turned in at 3 a.m. His next innings was against Kent when he posted his maiden first-class century in scoring 116.

Seventy years later, David Frith used &quot;My Dear Victorious Stod&quot; as the title of his acclaimed biography of Stoddart.

==Rugby career==

Stoddart also played ten rugby union internationals for England, and captained England four times. During his footballing career, Stoddart was at the forefront of many rugby firsts. In 1888, with fellow cricketers Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury he helped organise what became recognised as the first British Lions rugby union tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1888. The team played 55 matches, winning 27 of 35 rugby matches. He took over the captaincy early in the tour when Robert L. Seddon drowned in a sculling accident.

In 1890, Stoddart became a founding member of the Barbarian F.C., the invitational rugby club. On 27 December that year, Stoddart was given the captaincy of the very first Barbarian team, in a game against Hartlepool Rovers.

==Personal life==
While on tour in Australia, Stoddart met Emily Luckham, also known as Ethel Elizabeth, a popular singer and reciter, who subsequently married &quot;Bulletin&quot; journalist and Manly, New South Wales sporting identity, Robert Adams Luckham. In 1901, Emily left for Europe, reportedly for the good of her voice. She did not return, and her husband divorced her on grounds of desertion in 1903. She married Stoddart in 1906.

==Later life==
Stoddart and his wife lived in St John&#x27;s Wood, London. He worked on the London Stock Exchange, then became secretary of Queen&#x27;s Club. But like many wholehearted sportsmen, including fellow England captain, Arthur Shrewsbury, with whom he had opened the batting in Australia in 1893, he found life difficult after leaving the arena. In 1915, in failing health and burdened by debt he committed suicide, by firearm, in his bedroom in London. His remains lie in an unmarked grave in Radford, Coventry. A street in South Shields is named after him.

==Legacy==
A portrait painted by Henry Weigall Jr, of Stoddart batting and Gregor MacGregor keeping wicket, was given to the MCC in 1927 by W.H. Patterson, a MCC committee member. The identity of the artist of the oil painting was only reaffirmed in 2018. The picture regularly hangs in the Pavilion at Lord&#x27;s.

<text>Hugo Albert Emil Hermann Dingler (July 7, 1881, Munich – June 29, 1954, Munich) was a German scientist and philosopher.

==Life==
Hugo Dingler studied mathematics, philosophy, and physics with Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski, David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, Woldemar Voigt, and Wilhem Roentgen at the universities of Göttingen and Munich. He graduated from the University of Munich with a thesis under Aurel Voss. Dingler earned his Ph.D. in mathematics, physics and astronomy in 1906. His doctoral advisor was Ferdinand von Lindemann. In 1910 Dingler&#x27;s first attempt to earn a Habilitation failed. His second try in 1912 was successful. Dingler then taught as a Privatdozent and hold lectures on mathematics, philosophy and the history of science. He became a professor at the University of Munich in 1920. Dingler got a position as Professor ordinarius in Darmstadt in 1932.

In 1934, one year after the Nazis took power Dingler was dismissed from his teaching position for still unclear reasons. Dingler himself told several interviewers that this was because of his favorable writings concerning Jews. In fact both philo-semitic as well as anti-semitic statements by Dingler had been noted.

From 1934 to 1936 he again held a teaching position.

In 1940 Dingler joined the Nazi Party and was again given a teaching position. Of Dingler&#x27;s 1944 book &quot;Aufbau der exakten Fundamentalwissenschaft&quot; only thirty copies survived wartime bombing.

==Thought==
Dingler&#x27;s position is usually characterized as &quot;conventionalist&quot; by Karl Popper and others. Sometimes he is called a &quot;radical conventionalist&quot; (also referred to as &quot;critical voluntarism&quot; in the secondary literature), as by the early Rudolf Carnap. Dingler himself initially characterized it as &quot;critical conventionalism&quot;, to contrast it with the &quot;naïve conventionalism&quot; of other philosophers such as Poincaré, but he himself later ceased to call his position conventionalist. Dingler agrees with the conventionalists that the fundamental assumptions of geometry and physics are not extracted empirically and cannot be given a transcendental deduction. However, Dingler disagrees with conventionalists such as Henri Poincaré in that he does not believe there is freedom to choose alternative assumptions. Dingler believes that one can give a foundation to mathematics and physics by means of operations as building stones. Dingler claims that this operational analysis leads one to Euclidean geometry and Newtonian mechanics, which are the only possible results.

Dingler opposed Albert Einstein&#x27;s relativity theory and was therefore opposed and snubbed by most of the leaders of the German physics and mathematics community. This opposition, at least to the theory of general relativity, remains in the work of his follower Paul Lorenzen.

==Influence==
Paul Lorenzen, noted for his work on constructive foundations of mathematics was a follower of Dingler, at least with respect to the foundations of geometry and physics. The so-called Erlangen School of followers and allies of Lorenzen, including Kuno Lorenz, Wilhelm Kamlah, and Peter Janich, and more indirectly, Jürgen Mittelstraß, is thus in large part pursuing a modernized version of Dingler&#x27;s program which claims to incorporate relativity, quantum theory and quantum logic.

<text>Kew Palace is a British royal palace within the grounds of Kew Gardens on the banks of the River Thames. Originally a large complex, few elements of it survive. Dating to 1631 but built atop the undercroft of an earlier building, the main survivor is known as the Dutch House. Its royal occupation lasted from around 1728 until 1818, with a final short-lived occupation in 1844. The Dutch House is Grade I listed, and open to visitors. It is cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the government or the Crown. Alongside the Dutch House is a part of its 18th-century service wing, whilst nearby are a former housekeeper&#x27;s cottage, brewhouse and kitchen block – most of these buildings are private, though the kitchens are open to the public. These kitchens, the Great Pagoda and Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage are also run by Historic Royal Palaces.

==History==

=== Fortreys and Capels ===
Beneath the Dutch House is the undercroft of a 16th-century building. This was on land owned by John Dudley and restored to his son Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, childhood friend and court favourite of Elizabeth I, in 1558. It belonged to a west-facing brick building and may be identifiable with a house in Kew in which Robert Dudley entertained Elizabeth in 1563 – one of Elizabeth&#x27;s main palaces at that time was the nearby Richmond Palace.

In 1619, the building above the undercroft was leased by Samuel Fortrey, who finally demolished all but the undercroft in 1631, erecting a new larger south-facing manor house in its place. The father of the author Samuel Fortrey, Samuel Fortrey senior was a merchant descended from a family originating near Lille, though later confusion over his ancestry led to the building becoming known as the Dutch House. That name also originated in the house&#x27;s supposedly Dutch style of architecture, known as Artisan Mannerist and dominated by Dutch gables – this style was actually more prevalent in London, East Anglia and East Kent than the Netherlands at the time. In 1697, Fortrey&#x27;s descendants leased the building to Sir Richard Levett, a powerful merchant and the former Lord Mayor of London, who later left it to his daughter Mary.

===Kew House===
Facing the 1631 house was another mansion, possibly of Tudor origin. It was often visited by the diarist John Evelyn and passed from Richard Bennett to his daughter Dorothy, wife of Henry Capel. Dorothy and Henry remained childless and so the house then passed to Dorothy&#x27;s great-niece Elizabeth, wife of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s secretary, Samuel Molyneux, and then to Molyneux&#x27;s physician Nathaniel St André. This mansion, which was eventually pulled down in 1802, was also the site of James Bradley&#x27;s observations in 1725 that led to his discovery of the aberration of light. William IV marked the site of the observations with a Thomas Tompion sundial in 1832, transferred from Hampton Court Palace to a plinth to the Dutch House&#x27;s south-east. This was replaced with a replica in 1959 and moved to its new and different site directly to the south of the Dutch House.

=== George II&#x27;s children ===

In 1727, Queen Caroline and George II came to the British throne. By that time they had six children living with them at their summer residence at Richmond Lodge. In 1728 Caroline leased the Dutch House to house her three eldest daughters Anne, Amelia and Caroline and another nearby building which became known as the &#x27;Queen&#x27;s House&#x27;, though the intended occupant may have been her son William rather than the queen herself. This left Caroline&#x27;s two youngest daughters Mary and Louise with her at Richmond Lodge.

George and Caroline had come to Britain in 1714 when George&#x27;s father took the throne as George I, leaving their eldest son Frederick behind in Hanover aged 7. When George II succeeded his father, Frederick became Prince of Wales and so was finally allowed to come to Britain. He arrived in December 1728, less than a year after his mother had taken the lease on the Dutch House. Now aged 21, knowing little of his sisters and possibly wishing for a family rapprochement, he soon took a long lease on the old Capel House at Kew and in 1731 also purchased its contents from St André. Frederick then set about remodeling it with assistance from William Kent – it then became known as the White House due to its plastered exterior. Frederick also added a large new separate kitchen block, open to the public since 2012 as &#x27;the Royal Kitchens&#x27;. There was also a stable block of an unknown date serving the White House, located a short distance to its north-east and demolished in the late 19th century.

An oil-on-canvas musical portrait from 1733 shows Frederick and his three eldest sisters playing mandolin, harpsichord and cello. It was painted by his librarian and art agent Philip Mercier and exists in three variants, two of which show the Dutch House in the background (National Portrait Gallery and National Trust) – the third variant in the Royal Collection shows the same group in an interior, possibly Kensington Palace. Anne married and left England the year after the portrait was painted and Caroline left Kew in 1743, retiring to St James&#x27;s Palace, where she died in 1757.

Along with Cliveden, the White House became Frederick&#x27;s main family country home, where he entertained poets such as James Thomson (author of &quot;The Seasons&quot;) and Alexander Pope (who had moved into the area in 1719 and built his eponymous villa at Twickenham). In 1738 Pope gave Prince Frederick a dog, with the following verse inscribed on its collar:

:&quot;I am His Highness&#x27; dog at Kew.&quot;
:&quot;Pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?&quot;

=== Augusta and George III ===

Frederick began remodelling the gardens associated with the White House, but &quot;after staying all day in the garden till night, in the damp rain and hail to look at his workmen&quot; in 1751 he caught a chill which – combined with a pulmonary embolism – proved fatal. His widow Augusta continued living at the White House with their children and remodelling the gardens. She was advised by her husband&#x27;s friend John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and assisted by Sir William Chambers, one of the greatest masters of ornamental English gardening.

Frederick&#x27;s sister Amelia was probably still in the Dutch House throughout the 1730s and 1740s, but seems to have moved out in 1751 when she was made ranger of Richmond Park, which came with a residence at White Lodge. This meant the Dutch House could become a schoolhouse for Augusta&#x27;s two eldest sons, George (the future George III) and Edward, where they were taught by Bute and Chambers. In 1760 George took the throne, and a year later he married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, moving into Richmond Lodge as his summer residence as his family grew – he and Charlotte had fifteen children between 1762 and 1783.
Chambers built the Orangery and Great Pagoda at Kew for Augusta in 1761–62 but later in that decade she mainly lived at Carlton House. However, Augusta nominally retained the Dutch House and White House until her death in 1772, when they passed to George, who demolished Richmond Lodge and switched his summer residence to the White House. He also used the latter building to house some of his art collection, including a number of Canaletto&#x27;s works and &quot;The Tribuna of the Uffizi&quot; by Zoffany, who lived nearby and is buried at St Anne&#x27;s Church.

George continued the Dutch House&#x27;s use as a schoolhouse, now for his two eldest sons George and Frederick. This led to it being known as &#x27;the Prince of Wales&#x27;s House&#x27; or &#x27;the House Late the Prince of Wales&#x27;s&#x27;, though the future George IV never lived in it after his childhood. Small households of royal children were lodged in houses on Kew Green and the royal governess Lady Charlotte Finch also lived locally – in a watercolour of c. 1771–72 she is shown in the grounds of the Dutch House with some of the children.
A map of 1771 delineated the land between the Dutch House and the river as still belonging to barrister Levett Blackborne, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn barrister and grandson of Sir Richard Levett. This reflects the fact that the buildings and grounds were only leased by the royal family right up until 13 October 1781, when George III purchased the freehold from the Levetts for £20,000. Seven years later, George was kept in the White House during his first bout of &#x27;madness&#x27; from November 1788 to March 1789, with his wife Charlotte and their daughters living on the upper floors and the Grooms of the Bedchamber in the Dutch House. The White House was then allowed to fall into disrepair, though it still proved possible to house him there during the second bout in 1801, whilst Charlotte and her daughters moved into the Dutch House to await news of George&#x27;s recovery. The White House was finally demolished in 1802 and so on the onset of the third bout of &#x27;madness&#x27; in 1804 George was housed in an upgraded single-storey service wing of the Dutch House and possibly also on the ground floor of the Dutch House, with Charlotte and the princesses on the Dutch House&#x27;s first and second floors. (That service wing was mainly demolished in 1881 but originally connected directly onto the west side of the Dutch House.)

=== Disuse and decline ===

Another reason for the demolition of the White House and the decreasing use of the Dutch House was the Castellated Palace, whose planning and design began around 1800. George&#x27;s chosen architect was James Wyatt, whom he had taken on for works at Windsor Castle at around the same time. The building also became known as the New Palace or New Kew Palace and so the Dutch House was often known as the Old Palace or the Old Red House between 1800 and 1828.

George created a site for the Castellated Palace by demolishing the old Queen&#x27;s House and construction began around 1802. Known by some historians as &quot;a late Georgian Nonsuch&quot;, it was in the neo-Gothic style. George was a late convert to this style – he wrote to his daughter Charlotte in 1803 stating:

He had possibly been influenced by nearby Strawberry Hill House, by his earlier work on Windsor Castle and by his visits to Hartlebury Castle and Worcester Cathedral in 1788 and to Lulworth Castle and Sherborne Castle in 1789. Though Wyatt led the design, contributions were probably made by the king himself, who had been trained in architectural drawing as a boy at Kew by William Chambers. This royal involvement and interference may have contributed to repeated delays and overspend in construction thanks to his 1801 and 1804 illnesses. The new palace was widely criticised – in his 1817 &quot;A Morning&#x27;s Walk from London to Kew&quot;, Sir Richard Phillips nicknamed it &quot;the Bastile palace, from its resemblance to that building, so obnoxious to freedom and freemen.&quot; He continued:
John Bew also included the Castellated Palace in his tourists&#x27; guide of 1820:


The king stopped off at the Dutch House in August 1805 to meet with his daughter-in-law Caroline and his granddaughter Charlotte. His family moved back into the Dutch House in October that year until renovation work at the princesses&#x27; rooms in Windsor was complete. George made a final visit to Kew in 1806 to view works on the Castellated Palace and never returned, though the Dutch House was refitted in 1809 for his youngest daughter Princess Amelia, who had expressed a wish to move into it to convalesce from her tuberculosis. However, her parents vetoed this and she remained at Windsor, where her death in 1810 probably triggered the king&#x27;s final bout of &#x27;madness&#x27;.

This fourth and final bout of &#x27;madness&#x27; also meant that work on the Castellated Palace ceased for good, leaving only a mostly roofed shell. This bout lasted ten years, all of which time he was confined at Windsor rather than Kew. In 1818, Queen Charlotte set out from London to Windsor to see the king and to attend the double wedding of her sons William and Edward. En route she decided to spend a few days at the Dutch House, but since she was ill with dropsy she was unable to continue her journey and so the weddings took place in the drawing room there on 11 July 1818. Later that year, on 17 November, Charlotte died in her bedroom on the first floor of the building.

George died at Windsor in 1820 and his eldest son and successor George IV decided to demolish the Castellated Palace. After studying the project&#x27;s accounts (its total costs had risen to £500,000 by 1811 (equivalent to £ in pounds), as opposed to the initial allocation of £40,000 in 1800 (equivalent to £ in pounds)), Parliament approved that decision and ordered that the few fixtures and fittings which had already installed in the Castellated Palace be removed and sent to other royal residences – its staircase was later used at Buckingham Palace. The year before the demolition, an article stated:
=== Opened to the public ===
George IV also planned to demolish the Dutch House, but this did not come to fruition. Possibly influenced by having been married there in 1818, his brother William IV commissioned plans for adding a west wing to it and bringing it back into use, but this too did not come about. William did offer the Dutch House to his sister-in-law Victoria, Duchess of Kent for her and her daughter (the future Queen Victoria), but she turned it down as &quot;an old house quite unfit for the princess and me to occupy, being very inadequate in accommodation and almost destitute of furniture&quot;. Queen Victoria briefly sent three of her own children there in summer 1844, but the following year she and Prince Albert began remodelling Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as their summer residence. The Dutch House thus remained unoccupied until 1898, when she transferred it and Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage to Kew Gardens to mark her Diamond Jubilee. By this time the palace&#x27;s stables and most of the Dutch House&#x27;s service wing had been demolished, probably in 1881. A replica 17th-century Dutch garden was added to the house&#x27;s rear in 1969.

The Dutch House remained open to the public until 1996, when a major restoration project commenced. This not only included physical restoration to the building, but also weaving of period draperies and other fabric décor carried out by master weaver Ian Dale of Scotland. An external lift shaft was added on the west wing for disabled access, in the place of a privy shaft which had been demolished in the 1880s. The building was used to hold a dinner hosted by Charles, Prince of Wales to celebrate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II on 21 April 2006 – a few days later it reopened as a visitor attraction. The Palace was featured in the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tales from the Palaces&quot;. It is run by Historic Royal Palaces, which has also taken on responsibility for the Royal Kitchens (reopening them to the public in 2012) and the Pagoda (re-opened to the public in 2018).

<text>Sir Timothy Carew O&#x27;Brien, 3rd Baronet (5 November 1861 – 9 December 1948) was an Irish baronet who played cricket for England in five Test matches.

==Life and career==
Tim O&#x27;Brien was born in Dublin and educated at the Catholic school Downside in Somerset. He went to New Inn Hall, Oxford, principally in order to further his cricket career.

A forceful right-handed batsman, O&#x27;Brien won a Blue in 1884 and 1885. He went on to play 266 first-class cricket matches as an amateur for Oxford University and in fairly regular appearances for Middlesex through to 1898. His 92 for Oxford against the 1884 Australians was instrumental in the university&#x27;s only victory over an Australian team. He played for England against Australia at Old Trafford that year and again four years later at Lord&#x27;s, but in neither game did his distinguish himself.

He toured with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) teams twice: in 1887–88 he went with George Vernon to Australia and in 1895–96 he went with Lord Hawke&#x27;s side to South Africa, where he acted as captain once against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in February 1896, winning the game largely as a result of George Lohmann&#x27;s match return of 15/45 (7/38 and 8/7).

In county cricket, he was known for hard hitting innings, with a highest score of 202, scored as part of a partnership with Robert Slade Lucas that put on 338 in 200 minutes against Sussex in 1895.

Uniquely, O&#x27;Brien captained Ireland as well as England, recording a top score of 167 against his alma mater for the country of his birth during a brief Irish tour of England. This remained an Irish record until 1973.

O&#x27;Brien married Gundrede Annette Teresa de Trafford, daughter of Sir Humphrey de Trafford 2nd baronet on 26 September 1885 at All Saints Church, Barton-upon-Irwell and they had 10 children, one of whom, Timothy Jnr., died in Flanders during the First World War. Another child, daughter Sicele O&#x27;Brien was a well known pioneer pilot. Sir Timothy was, at the time of his death in 1948, the oldest cricketer to have played in England-Australia Tests. His brother John also played international cricket for Ireland.

<text>Liechtenstein Castle () is a castle near Maria Enzersdorf in Lower Austria, bordering Vienna. It is on the edge of the &quot;Wienerwald&quot; (Vienna Woods). Liechtenstein (German for &quot;bright stone&quot;) Castle is the eponymous ancestral seat and place of origin of the House of Liechtenstein, the ruling family of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The family owned the castle from the middle of the 12th century until the 13th century, and again from 1808 to the present.

== History ==

The progenitor Hugo von Liechtenstein (d. 1156) built Liechtenstein Castle around 1122-36 on a fief that he received from the Babenberg margraves of Austria. He had also received the fiefs and tower houses of Leesdorf and Weikersdorf about 10 km south of it near Baden. Originally he had come to Austria in the knightly entourage of Diepold III, Margrave of Vohburg. The latter gave him Petronell-Carnuntum on the Danube as a fief, near the then border with the Kingdom of Hungary, where he built a castle near the old Roman settlement. These lands extended to Rohrau Castle. Petronell and Rohrau, which became his own property (allod) in 1142 from feudal property, remained important Liechtenstein seats in the High Middle Ages. 

Liechtenstein castle, originally started with a tower, but probably immediately expanded into a larger palace complex during the 12th century, came into the Stadeck family as a result of the marriage of Dietmut of Liechtenstein (died 1308) to Leutold of Stadeck (died 1295). Since Albert IV, Duke of Austria, the castle has been pledged to various families. It was destroyed by the Ottomans in the siege of Vienna in 1529, and again in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. 

In 1808, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, bought his ancestral seat back. In the years 1820 to 1821 he built Schloss Liechtenstein below the castle, which is now used as a retirement home. In the years that followed, he had the landscape park around the ruins designed as a romantic landscape garden and built several artificial ruins. Between 1808 and 1816 the first restoration measures were carried out by the architect Joseph Hardtmuth. However, the castle remained in ruins until 1884, when it was rebuilt by architect Carl Gangolf Kayser for Johann II.

Today, the castle hosts the Nestroy Theatre Festival, which is held annually during the summer months. The 1969 film &quot;A Walk with Love and Death&quot;, the 1971 film &quot;The Vampire Happening&quot;, the 1979 film &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot;, and the 1993 film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; featured shots of the castle. In 2008 and 2009 it was renovated and given a new roof. The castle has been open to the public again since spring 2010. Guided tours take place daily.

<text>Yvan Attal (; ; born ) is a French actor, scriptwriter and film director.

==Life and career==
Born in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Algerian-Jewish parents. He grew up in the outskirts of Paris. His acting debut was in Éric Rochant&#x27;s &quot;Un monde sans pitié&quot; (1989), which earned him a César Award for Most Promising Actor. His first feature film as director was &quot;Ma femme est une actrice&quot; (2001), which co-starred Charlotte Gainsbourg, Attal&#x27;s real-life partner.

He directed a segment in the film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, and appeared as an actor in another.

He acted in &quot;The Interpreter&quot; and &quot;Anthony Zimmer&quot;, and in &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; he played a French cab driver named George.

==Personal life==
Attal&#x27;s longtime partner is Anglo-French actress-singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom he met on the set of the 1991 film &quot;Aux yeux du monde&quot;. Gainsbourg and Attal are not married, and Gainsbourg has attributed her reluctance to marry to the fact that her parents never married. Attal publicly proposed to Gainsbourg on 19 June 2013 during an awards ceremony when he received the French National Order of Merit. In April 2014, Attal confirmed that they were still unwed with no plans to marry.

Attal has three children with Gainsbourg. In 2014, following the death of Gainsbourg&#x27;s sister, photographer Kate Barry, Attal and his family relocated to New York City.

<doc id="1328629" wikidata="Q5367604" url="?curid=1328629" title="Elsie Leung">
<text>Elsie Leung Oi-sie, GBM, JP (; born 24 April 1939) is a Hong Kong politician and solicitor. She was Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong from 1997 to 2005 and a member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong.

==Early life and education==
Leung was born in Hong Kong to a family originating from Nanhai region, Foshan, China. She was educated in Hong Kong, at Chung Wah Middle School (a leftist school shut down by the government), Sacred Heart Canossian College (formerly known as Italian Convent School and Sacred Heart School) and the University of Hong Kong. Leung passed her Law Society Qualifying Examinations in 1967 and obtained her LLM degree from the University of Hong Kong in 1988. She is a past President of the International Federation of Women Lawyers.

==Legal career==
Elsie Leung qualified as a solicitor in 1967 and entered practice a year later. She was a partner at local law firms P. H. Sin &amp; Co. and Iu, Lai &amp; Li Solicitors, specialising in matrimonial law. She served on various government boards and committees, including the Independent Police Complaints Council, Equal Opportunities Commission, Social Welfare Advisory Committee and Inland Revenue Board of Review. She was also honorary legal adviser to many non-governmental organisations.

==Political career==
Leung was a founding member of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). She was appointed as a Delegate of the People&#x27;s Congress of Guangdong in 1989. In 1993, she was appointed as a Delegate of the 8th National People&#x27;s Congress as well as a Hong Kong Affairs Adviser. In the period leading up to the handover, Leung advised the Chief Executive Designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on legal matters relating to the establishment of the HKSAR.

===Secretary for Justice===

On 1 July 1997, Leung became the first Secretary for Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, replacing Attorney General Jeremy Mathews. She was the Chief Executive&#x27;s chief legal adviser and an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Executive Council. She headed the Department of Justice which has a staff of over 1,000, of whom about 290 are lawyers.

She is currently the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission, the Committee on Bilingual Legal System, the Legal Practitioners&#x27; Liaison Committee and serves on numerous committees, including the Fight Crime Committee and the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

Leung was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal in July 2002 for her &quot;distinguished public service&quot;, and for her &quot;significant contributions in ensuring the successful implementation of the new constitutional order under the One country, two systems concept&quot;. She retired from office in October 2005.

===Controversies and views===
Leung was involved in controversy in 1999 when, as Secretary for Justice, she refused to prosecute Sally Aw over the circulation fraud at &quot;The Standard&quot;. The Hong Kong Bar Association accused her of being &quot;careless&quot; in her handling of the case for failing to ensure that justice was seen to be done. The Democratic Party and the Liberal Party backed legal-sector legislator Margaret Ng&#x27;s motion of no-confidence. However, during the Legislative Council vote, the Liberal Party objected to government lobbying. It accused the Tung administration of applying &quot;back door&quot; pressure on them to support Leung. The Liberals abstained in the vote, and party deputy chairman Ronald Arculli staged a walk-out.

The Hong Kong government however expressed full confidence in Leung, saying that in all the above cases she had acted entirely in accordance with the Basic Law and the prosecution policy of the Department of Justice.

In March 2021, after Beijing announced changes to restrict the influence of district councillors as well as filtering potential Legislative Council members through the election committee, Leung claimed that Hong Kong could still move towards democracy after things &quot;return to the right track.&quot; In April 2021, Leung claimed that moves to ensure only &quot;patriots&quot; serve in the government did not go against the principles of having a &quot;high degree of autonomy,&quot; and claimed that such changes were not designed for &quot;taking steps back&quot; in democratic progress.

In November 2022, Leung privately shared that she backed the Court of Final Appeal&#x27;s decision which allowed Jimmy Lai to hire Tim Owen, and that the NPCSC interpretation to ban foreign lawyers was not necessary, citing Xi Jinping&#x27;s message that Hong Kong maintain the use of the common law system. However, Leung said she was not opposed to John Lee asking the NPCSC to step in.

<doc id="1328633" wikidata="Q3527206" url="?curid=1328633" title="Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke">
<text>Martin Bladen Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke (16 August 1860 – 10 October 1938), generally known as Lord Hawke, was an English amateur cricketer active from 1881 to 1911 who played for Yorkshire and England. He was born in Willingham by Stow, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and died in Edinburgh. He appeared in 633 first-class matches, including five Test matches, as a righthanded batsman, scoring 16,749 runs with a highest score of 166 and held 209 catches. He scored 13 centuries and 69 half-centuries.

Since an 1870 inheritance of his father, Hawke was styled ; he inherited the barony on 5 December 1887 on the death of his father, Edward Henry Julius Hawke, Rector of Willingham 1854–1875, after which the family returned to its seat (main home held for a generation or more), Wighill House and Park, near Tadcaster, Yorkshire. Admiral Hawke, the first Baron, was among the few Admirals elevated for his roles during the Seven Years&#x27; War: at the Battle of Quiberon Bay, off Nantes, France, and promoting the Western Squadron blockade of France.

Hawke was educated at Eton, where he was a member of the school cricket eleven in 1878 and 1879. As he had been a moderate scholar, his father decided he should receive private tuition at home for two years. In October 1881, Hawke went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge University Cricket Club team from 1882 to 1885. He won a Cambridge blue three times: in 1882, 1883 and 1885. He was captain of the Cambridge team in the 1885 season.

After Hawke left Eton in July 1879 and began his two years of private tuition, he was invited by the Reverend Edmund Carter to play for the Yorkshire Gentlemen&#x27;s Cricket Club, which was based at the Yorkshire Gentlemen Cricket Club Ground in York. Living at Wighill Park since 1875 had given Hawke a residential qualification to play for the county club.

In September 1881, Carter invited him to the Scarborough Festival where he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Hawke went to Cambridge a month later and played for the university team from May to July 1882 before returning to Yorkshire. At this time, Hawke was usually the only amateur in the Yorkshire team. He refused the captaincy at first, saying he wanted to learn the job by playing under the professional captain, Test bowler Tom Emmett. Hawke was formally appointed club captain for the 1883 season, though he was still at Cambridge, and held the post until 1910. He remains the most successful county captain ever, Yorkshire winning the County Championship a record eight times during his tenure.

As a captain, Hawke was noted for taking a strong, and some would say paternalistic, interest in the welfare of his professional players. Certain aspects of this policy caused resentment but he was on the whole respected for it. Even so, he was strict on discipline and expelled the England bowler Bobby Peel from first-class cricket after he went out to play in a drunken state.

During his playing career, Hawke became an influential figure in cricket administration. He was elected Yorkshire club president in 1898, while still captaining the team, and held the post until his death. He had a missionary-like zeal to develop cricket overseas and undertook nine tours as a player between 1887–88 and 1911–12, leading teams to Australia, India (twice), North America (twice), South Africa (twice), the West Indies and Argentina. All five of Hawke&#x27;s Test appearances were made in South Africa. He captained the England team four times and was always on the winning side.

After he retired from playing, Hawke became a major figure at MCC as well as at Yorkshire. He was appointed President of MCC for 1914 and retained the post, which is normally an annual appointment, through the First World War. He was appointed Honorary Treasurer of MCC from 1932 to 1937. As an administrator, he held considerable influence but came under some criticism. He was accused of inactivity at the time of the &quot;Bodyline&quot; controversy. Most famously, he was disparaged for his oft-quoted and oft-misquoted statement: &quot;Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England&quot;. Hawke&#x27;s biographer noted that &quot;his blunders on numerous public forums were to blight his declining years&quot;.

Hawke married in 1916 but he and his wife had no children. After 1924, when the lease on Wighill Park expired, the couple lived in North Berwick. His wife died in 1936 and Hawke himself died in hospital following a collapse at his home. He was succeeded as Baron Hawke by his younger brother.

==Personal and family life==
Martin Bladen Hawke was born on 16 August 1860 at Willingham Rectory, Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. He was the sixth child, and eldest surviving son, of Edward Henry Julius Hawke, 6th Baron Hawke of Towton, and Baroness Hawke (née Jane Dowker). His father was Rector at Willingham from 1854 to 1875. Hawke&#x27;s first school was at Newark and then he attended St Michael&#x27;s, Aldin House in Slough, a preparatory school for Eton College, which Hawke attended from 1874 to 1879. After Eton, his father decided he should have private tuition for two years, as he was a moderate scholar only, and it was not until October 1881 that Hawke went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he stayed until 1885. At Cambridge, he was a member of the University Pitt Club.

From 1870, when his father succeeded to the barony, Hawke was styled The Honourable. In 1875, the family moved from Willingham to Wighill Park, near Tadcaster, the lease of which was subsidised by a family friend, and Wighill was the baronial seat for the next fifty years until the lease expired. Hawke&#x27;s residency at Wighill Park enabled him to play for Yorkshire County Cricket Club under county cricket qualification rules that had been introduced in 1873.

On 5 December 1887, Hawke succeeded as 7th Baron on the death of his father and was henceforward known universally as Lord Hawke. He married Marjory Nelson Ritchie ( Maud) Edwards, daughter of W. Peacock Edwards, on 1 June 1916, less than a year after the death of his mother, with whom he had lived formerly. His best man was his close friend Christopher Heseltine, with whom he played cricket alongside and travelled the world extensively with. Marjory was a widow and the same age as Hawke. The couple had no children and, when Hawke died, the title passed to his younger brother. When the lease on Wighill expired in 1924, the Hawkes removed to Marjory&#x27;s home at North Berwick where they lived for the rest of their lives.

During his time at Cambridge University, Hawke had been commissioned into the 5th West Yorkshire Militia and, in 1890, he put himself forward for military duties. He gained the rank of captain and later became an honorary major in the service of the 3rd Battalion of the Prince of Wales&#x27; Own Yorkshire Regiment. He gained the rank of colonel in the service of the West Riding Volunteer Regiment. In the non-military sphere, Hawke held the office of justice of the peace (JP) for the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Hawke died, aged 78, on 10 October 1938 in a nursing home at West End, Edinburgh, following an emergency operation after he collapsed at his home in North Berwick. Although he was cremated at Edinburgh Crematorium, his ashes were taken to be interred at West Norwood Cemetery, in the London Borough of Lambeth, alongside those of his late wife who had pre-deceased him on 25 January 1936. His sister&#x27;s sons, Anthony Tew and John Tew, were both first-class cricketers.

==Playing career in England==

===Early years===
Hawke inherited a keen interest in cricket from his father, who was involved with the Willingham village club and was passionate about the sport. Having played at his early schools, Hawke made 19 known appearances for the Eton College team between 1876 and 1879. He was coached at Eton by Mike Mitchell who transformed the school&#x27;s cricket team during the 1870s and developed other noted players such as Alfred Lyttelton, Charles Studd and Ivo Bligh. Hawke made his first appearance at Lord&#x27;s in July 1878 when he played in the prestigious Eton v Harrow match.

In the two years when Hawke had private tuition at home, from summer 1879 to October 1881, he played for the York-based Yorkshire Gentlemen&#x27;s Cricket Club, whose leading light was the Reverend Edmund Carter, a man whose influence would guide Hawke towards the captaincy of Yorkshire.

In September 1881, Carter invited Hawke to the Scarborough Festival where he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire on 1 and 2 September, two weeks after his 21st birthday. The match was Yorkshire v Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at North Marine Road and Hawke, who was bowled by Billy Barnes in both innings, scored 4 and 0. MCC won by an innings and 35 runs. A few days later, in another Festival match, Hawke played for Yorkshire against I Zingari and made a top score of 32 in Yorkshire&#x27;s second innings as they were beaten by 159 runs.

===1882 to 1885===
Hawke&#x27;s third first-class appearance was his debut for Cambridge University on 12 and 13 June 1882 when he played against Lancashire at Old Trafford. He made 18 first-class appearances in 1882, scoring 570 runs at 18.38 with two half-centuries and a top score of 66. He played for Cambridge four times in June, including the University Match against Oxford University at Lord&#x27;s and gained the first of his three blues. From July to September, he played in 13 games for Yorkshire.

When Hawke rejoined Yorkshire in July 1882, the team&#x27;s professional captain Tom Emmett offered to stand down but Hawke refused and insisted on learning the job by playing under Emmett. James Coldham quoted Hawke as saying to Emmett that he wanted to &quot;pick up a few wrinkles first&quot;. Hawke and Emmett got along very well, despite their social differences, and Hawke played to the end of August under Emmett&#x27;s leadership, often being the only amateur in the team. There had been few amateur cricketers in the Yorkshire team before Hawke and there had been complaints from the cricket establishment that the Yorkshire Committee preferred to play professionals. This had much to do with the clash between the county club and Carter&#x27;s Yorkshire Gentlemen but there was in fact a shortage of suitably talented amateurs too. Hawke assumed the captaincy for the two Scarborough Festival matches against MCC and I Zingari. At the end of the 1882 season, though he had just turned 22, Hawke was appointed Yorkshire club captain, the first amateur to hold the position. He remained in charge for 28 seasons until 1910, during which time the team won eight County Championships, still a record for one captain in county cricket.

In a tribute to Hawke, the editor of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; related that Hawke&#x27;s &quot;strength of the character was tested&quot; when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of &quot;elements that were not entirely harmonious&quot;. Owing to Hawke&#x27;s &quot;tact, judgment and integrity&quot;, he moulded the Eleven into &quot;the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England&quot;. Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as &quot;gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals&quot; who were often described as &quot;ten drunks and a parson&quot;. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and &quot;rough-hewn image&quot; had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would &quot;instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team&quot;.

Hawke&#x27;s task was not only to eradicate the drink problem but also, in Birley&#x27;s view, &quot;to unite the club&#x27;s geographical and social factions&quot; and try to produce a winning team. Yorkshire had evolved from the old Sheffield Cricket Club and it had been the case since its foundation in 1863 that all fourteen members of the County Committee were elected by Sheffield districts; and all fourteen of these committee men plus the secretary Joseph Wostinholm were loyal to the President and Treasurer, Michael Ellison. As a result, to the chagrin and vociferous opposition of the rest of the county, Ellison and Sheffield effectively controlled Yorkshire cricket. Edmund Carter was one of Ellison&#x27;s main critics and opponents. At the end of the 1882 season, in addition to appointing Hawke as captain, the committee agreed to reorganise itself for the first time since the club&#x27;s foundation. Admitting that it should represent the views of Yorkshire as a whole, the committee enlarged itself from 14 to 21 by inviting seven new members: one each from Bradford, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds and York in addition to the existing 14 from Sheffield. So, although the other districts now had a voice, the Sheffield contingent retained complete control. However, York&#x27;s representative was Edmund Carter and, although there was now reduced friction in Yorkshire&#x27;s affairs, the issue of representation had only been deferred.

Hawke at this time had minimal influence and Coldham wrote that he cannot be seen as anything more than an &quot;instrument of change&quot;, though his appointment did represent a &quot;watershed&quot; in the club&#x27;s history. Whatever the extent of Hawke&#x27;s involvement in the 1882 machinations, ten years would pass before Yorkshire was fully reorganised and, coincidentally, it was in 1893 that Hawke&#x27;s team won Yorkshire&#x27;s first official County Championship. Birley wrote that Yorkshire, &quot;restored to feudalism&quot;, was now &quot;ready to play the establishment game&quot;.
Hawke enjoyed a personal success in the second match of the 1883 season when he scored his maiden first-class century with 141 for Cambridge against C I Thornton&#x27;s XI at Fenner&#x27;s. He shared a third wicket partnership of 160 with Cambridge captain Charles Studd against a bowling attack that included Test players Billy Barnes, Ted Peate and George Ulyett. The match was drawn due to interruptions by rain after Thornton&#x27;s XI scored 175 and 229; Cambridge replied with 317 and 44–3.

Hawke&#x27;s appointment as Yorkshire captain brought early success as the team enjoyed a good season in 1883 with a record of 9 wins and 5 draws in 16 inter-county matches. In 1884, Yorkshire won half their inter-county matches, 8 out of 16, but four defeats left them well adrift of Nottinghamshire in the unofficial championship standings. In his 1924 memoirs, &quot;Recollections and Reminiscences&quot;, Hawke described the 1884 season as &quot;my least successful&quot; and explained that militia duties had interfered with his cricket at Cambridge, for whom he made only two appearances with modest scores in both. With Hawke mostly absent, Louis Hall took over the captaincy.

Hawke was more absent in 1885 when, with Hall again leading the team, Yorkshire won seven of their 16 inter-county matches and had the second best record after Nottinghamshire, whom they defeated by an innings and 28 runs, the only match that Nottinghamshire lost.

From his first match as Yorkshire captain in August 1882, Hawke played in only nineteen out of 67 first team games between then and September 1885. The captaincy, for all intents and purposes, had gone back to the professionals with first Emmett and then Hall having taken over. Hall led the team in 37 matches through 1884 and 1885.

Hawke made eight appearances for Cambridge in 1885 with a best score of 73 against MCC and he played his last match for them in June against Oxford.

===1886 to 1889===
Although some people assumed that Hawke had turned his back on Yorkshire, he returned with new vigour in 1886 to begin what he himself referred to as his consistent association with the county. While Hawke had formerly been the figurehead who tossed the coin, he now took complete charge of operations and began the transformation of the team in earnest. The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as &quot;the boys of my old brigade&quot;, was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called &quot;a protracted period of rebuilding&quot;. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire&#x27;s successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.

In addition to drinking, the &quot;old brigade&quot; had a professional problem in their poor standard of fielding. In a history of Yorkshire cricket to the end of the 19th century, the author commented that the Yorkshire team was &quot;terribly slack in the field&quot; and their reputation, which became a joke among county players, was such that they were believed to be too polite to run anyone out. For example, W. G. Grace said of Bates that he would have been the &quot;greatest all-rounder of his time but for his poor fielding&quot;. Hawke was determined to address both of these problems and said in his memoirs of the fielding problem that he had &quot;never known a side do well that could not hold catches&quot;.

Yorkshire finished fifth under Hawke&#x27;s leadership in 1886 and he enjoyed a personal success when he scored his maiden Yorkshire century against Sussex at Hove with 144 out of a total of 284 in the first innings. Hawke also made four half-centuries and his total runs for the season, his best to date, was 831 at an average of 23.74.

In 1887, Yorkshire finished third behind the strong Surrey team of the time. Peel was an early success but Hawke later recollected that &quot;it was the only summer when Yorkshire&#x27;s batting proved distinctly superior to its bowling&quot;. He had a good season with the bat himself, just missing his thousand runs with a total of 967 at an average of 24.79. He made one century and five fifties, the century being an innings of 125 against Lancashire in the Roses Match at Old Trafford. Hawke made his runs in a total of 414 which enabled Yorkshire to win by an innings and 39 runs.

Yorkshire improved in 1888 to finish second behind Surrey but Hawke&#x27;s contribution was modest. He played in only 10 matches and scored just 155 runs at the low average of 8.15. In 1889, Yorkshire finished last but one, in seventh place, despite an outstanding effort by Peel who was top of both the batting and bowling averages that year. Hawke himself had an indifferent season, averaging only 17.75, but his response was to dispense with the services of several players who were not up to standard. Club President Michael Ellison expressed his disapproval of the situation in an address to the committee: &quot;The great difficulty with which they had to contend arose from what I might term &quot;the demon drink&quot;&quot;.

===1890 to 1892===
The club&#x27;s preparations for the next season involved playing several trial matches, which Hawke encouraged the committee to arrange. The new team needed time to take shape although they did quite well in 1890 and finished third, again behind Surrey, and Derek Hodgson wrote that Hawke himself was &quot;the most consistent batsman&quot; that season. He scored 658 runs at 21.93 with a highest score of 74 among three half-centuries.

In the 1891 season, Yorkshire lost twice as many as they won, finishing last but one a second time. Hawke&#x27;s own form was poorer than in 1890 and he scored only 344 runs at 13.23 but he did complete his fifth career century with 126 when he opened the innings for Yorkshire against Somerset at Taunton. The poor results in 1891 caused a fall in revenue as supporters stayed away and mounted a &quot;Sack the Committee&quot; campaign. Hodgson wrote that the complaints included the committee being out of touch and &quot;needing greater knowledge of grassroots cricket&quot;, but the key demand was for a further reorganisation on a broader county basis. Yorkshire showed a slight improvement in 1892 while more team changes took place and finished sixth with five wins and five defeats. Hawke had another modest season with the bat, scoring 532 runs at 17.16 with a highest innings of 74 not out. The committee finally heeded the criticism and, by 1893, the Sheffield contingent had been reduced with other areas at last being given a greater say. Hawke, who had not been subject to criticism, was appointed one of two new vice-presidents. J. M. Kilburn stated that &quot;Hawke&#x27;s authority in the councils of Yorkshire grew because of the committee reorganisation of 1893 and grew again through his election to the office of President in 1898&quot;.

===1893 to 1896===

Hawke got what he wanted in 1893 as his new Yorkshire team fulfilled its promise and won the County Championship, the club&#x27;s first-ever title. It was achieved by what Hodgson called &quot;a cumulative effort&quot;, although the standout players were Ted Wainwright, Hirst and Peel; and was the &quot;first confirmation of Hawke&#x27;s striving for teamwork and discipline&quot;. Hawke himself played in only 11 matches that season and George Ulyett deputised for him as team captain. Hawke scored 241 runs at 15.06 with two half-centuries. With the title won by a team built on his principles and under his direction, Hawke established himself the &quot;de facto&quot; supremo of Yorkshire cricket. His captaincy had changed the character of cricket in the county and, for himself, he enjoyed cricket both as a pastime and in terms of his own growing influence upon it. In Kilburn&#x27;s view, Hawke &quot;accepted authority and the responsibilities of authority; he assumed the responsibilities of leadership and exercised them with determination to lead&quot;.

The combination of Hawke&#x27;s methods and the professional approach of his players (including amateurs like Jackson) produced consistency and Yorkshire developed a &quot;playing to win&quot; philosophy that persisted into the latter half of the 20th century, the improvement in fielding being its most significant aspect. The consistency is evident in a glance at the championship standings from 1893 to 1909, effectively the rest of Hawke&#x27;s captaincy, when the team had one fourth-place finish (1897) and were otherwise always in the top three with titles in 1893, 1896, 1898, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1905 and 1908.

Hawke had a better season in 1894 when he played 25 matches and scored 725 runs at 20.13 with a highest score of 157, his personal best to date, which he made for A. J. Webbe&#x27;s XI against Cambridge University at Fenner&#x27;s. In 1895, he played in 32 matches and had 51 innings which enabled him to complete 1,000 runs in the season for the only time in his career. He totalled 1,078 at 23.95 with a highest score of 79 among 7 half-centuries.

In 1896, when Yorkshire won their second championship, Hawke played in 26 matches and, for the first time, managed to score two centuries in a season. He began the season in great style after his return from a winter tour of South Africa, scoring a career-high 166 for Yorkshire against Warwickshire at Edgbaston as Yorkshire amassed a record 887 with Hawke and Peel sharing a partnership of 292 for the 8th wicket. Three weeks later he scored 110 not out for Yorkshire against Kent. Both these centuries were scored in May but Hawke did not maintain his fine start to the season and finished with a total of 708 runs at 24.41.

===1897 to 1902===

One of Hawke&#x27;s qualities as a leader was his willingness to impose discipline when necessary and a famous instance of this occurred in 1897 when he was forced to dismiss Bobby Peel from Yorkshire&#x27;s service for drunkenness. However, Peel&#x27;s replacement was Wilfred Rhodes who became arguably the club&#x27;s greatest-ever player. Yorkshire won a third title in 1898, the same year that Hawke was elected Yorkshire President in succession to Michael Ellison, and he again scored two centuries in the season. He just missed his thousand runs, scoring 950 at 30.64 including scores of 107 not out for Yorkshire against Kent and 134 for Yorkshire against Warwickshire. In 1899, he scored 923 runs at 26.37 with a highest score of 127 for Yorkshire against Hampshire.

Swanton wrote that, by 1900, Hawke had &quot;moulded Yorkshire into the finest side in the country&quot; and they won the County Championship three years in succession from 1900 to 1902. They were &quot;essentially a complete team&quot; with the batting of Tunnicliffe, Brown and David Denton; the powerful all-round play of Hirst, Rhodes and Schofield Haigh; and, crucially given Test calls, &quot;plentiful reserves of high quality&quot;. According to Kilburn, Hawke came to the &quot;fulfilment of his cricketing ambitions&quot; with the three successive titles which were &quot;a logical culmination to ten years of cultivation&quot;. Hawke&#x27;s own batting was variable during these three seasons. He had little success in 1900 but scored 902 runs and 7 half-centuries in 1901; and then 565 runs with 2 centuries and no half-centuries in 1902. His 1902 centuries were 107 not out for MCC against Oxford University and 126 for Yorkshire against Surrey.

Hawke&#x27;s loyalty to Yorkshire was such that he would put county before country if an issue arose. In 1901, Hirst and Rhodes were invited to join a team organised by Archie MacLaren to tour Australia and Hawke refused to authorise their selection, preferring instead to have the Yorkshire Committee pay them compensation. Hawke was driven by principle as he strongly supported a demand for official sponsorship of England Tests at home and tours abroad. He believed that MCC should accept this responsibility and, when a year later they did, Hawke was more than willing to release his players to assist England. Hawke&#x27;s concern was that any Yorkshire players on tour should be given the same care and consideration that they received from the county club and he believed that only MCC would share Yorkshire&#x27;s sense of responsibility.

===1903 to 1911===

Joseph Wolstinholm retired as Club Secretary after the 1902 season and was succeeded by Frederick Toone who had previously been the secretary at Leicestershire. With Wolstinholm gone, Hawke had the county offices moved from Sheffield to the more central location of Leeds. Yorkshire, now completely under Hawke&#x27;s influence, went on to claim two more titles under his captaincy in 1905 and 1908; in the latter season, they were unbeaten. What Swanton called &quot;Yorkshire&#x27;s abundance of reserves&quot; was emphasised in 1905 when they won the title again despite contributing five of their best players to England in the Test series against Australia.

Hawke scored his last first-class century in 1904 for Yorkshire against Leicestershire with 100 not out. His batting faded after this and he managed only three further half-centuries in the rest of his career while his season average never again reached 20. He made a score of 61 not out for Yorkshire against Essex in 1907 and then 50 not out for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire in 1908.

1908 was Hawke&#x27;s last full season as a player. He played only a few matches in 1909 and formally resigned as captain in 1910. He was succeeded by Everard Radcliffe, who held the post until the end of the 1911 season.

Hawke retired from his post as chairman of selectors in 1909 and, in the same year, he was named a &quot;Wisden&quot; &quot;Cricketer of the Year&quot; when the award was titled &quot;Lord Hawke and Four Cricketers of the Year&quot;. In the citation, &quot;Wisden&quot; said of Hawke that he &quot;has won the affection and regard of his professionals without for a moment losing his authority&quot;. Although Hawke was an &quot;absolute master&quot;, said &quot;Wisden&quot;, &quot;he has always used his power wisely&quot;.

Hawke made his final first-class appearance for Yorkshire in a Scarborough Festival match against MCC at North Marine Road on 31 August to 2 September 1911. Playing under the captaincy of Archibald White, Hawke scored 20 and 8 not out in a tightly contested draw: at close of play on the final day, MCC were only 4 runs behind with 3 wickets standing.

==Overseas tours and Test career==
Writing in 1899 during Hawke&#x27;s career, W. G. Grace commented that Hawke &quot;in various ways has materially assisted in extending the area of the cricket-playing world&quot;. E. W. Swanton wrote that Hawke &quot;did much to foster a love of cricket in many parts of the world&quot;. Hawke saw himself as something of a cricketing missionary with a desire to develop the sport overseas. He became one of cricket&#x27;s most prolific tourists, undertaking nine tours as a player between 1887–88 and 1911–12. These took him to Australia (1887–88), India and Ceylon (1889–90), North America (1891), India and Ceylon (1892–93), North America (1894), South Africa (1895–96), West Indies (1896–97), South Africa (1898–99) and Argentina (1911–12).

===Australia: 1887–88===
Two English teams toured Australia in the winter of 1887–88. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that &quot;it is certain that such a piece of folly will never be perpetrated again&quot; but the cause was rivalry between clubs in Melbourne and Sydney, who both wanted to promote an English team; and &quot;Wisden&quot; recorded that the Melbourne venture returned a significant loss of revenue. The team backed by the Sydney-based group was composed mainly of professionals under the management of Arthur Shrewsbury and called A. Shrewsbury&#x27;s XI although it was captained on the field by one of its amateur members, usually C. Aubrey Smith. The other team, organised by George Vernon on commission by the Melbourne Cricket Club, was called G. F. Vernon&#x27;s XI and its captain at the outset was the Hon. Martin B. Hawke.

Hawke played in three first-class matches against South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. He had only moderate success, playing five innings in which he totalled 76 runs at 15.20 with a highest score of 48, and he held one catch. On Tuesday 6 December, at Richmond, New South Wales, Hawke received the news that his father had died and that he was now the 7th Baron Hawke of Towton. He relinquished the captaincy of the team to Walter Read and set sail for home.

===India and Ceylon: 1889–90 and 1892–93===
Hawke toured India and Ceylon in the winter of 1889–90 as captain of an all-amateur team organised by George Vernon. It was the first time an English team had toured India but it played no first-class matches. Having played two matches in Ceylon, the team played eleven in India, including visits to Calcutta, Allahabad, Bombay and the Punjab.

In the winter of 1892–93, Hawke formed his own all-amateur team to tour Ceylon and India. It was a useful side that included future England Test players Stanley Jackson and Ledger Hill. They started with three matches in Ceylon in November 1892 that were not first-class. Moving to India, the team played twenty matches between November and March, including four that are recognised as first-class. One of these was a match at Allahabad against an All-India XI and, though Hawke did not play himself, his team won by an innings and 5 runs. In the three first-class matches that he took part in, Hawke had five innings, totalling exactly 100 runs with a highest score of 79; he held one catch.

===North America: 1891–92 and 1894–95===
Hawke toured North America in 1891–92 and 1894. On the first tour, his team played a total of ten matches including two &quot;fill up&quot; games. Only two, both against a Gentlemen of Philadelphia XI, are currently rated first-class by &quot;CricketArchive&quot;. In these two games, Hawke had four innings and totalled 144 runs with a highest score of 74; he held two catches. On the second tour in September and October 1894, he played three first-class innings in matches against the same Philadelphia team and totalled 141 runs with a highest score of 78.

===South Africa: 1895–96 and 1898–99===
Hawke led an England team to South Africa in 1895–96 which played three Test matches. This was the strongest touring team Hawke formed as it included C.B. Fry, George Lohmann, Sammy Woods and Tom Hayward. Hawke played in all four first-class matches on the tour, including the three Tests, but he totalled only 46 runs in his six innings with a highest score of 30; he held three catches.

Hawke toured South Africa again in 1898–99. This time, the team played five first-class matches, including two Tests which England won. The players included Johnny Tyldesley, Schofield Haigh, Albert Trott and Pelham Warner. Although Hawke was successful as a winning captain, his batting was poor with only 69 runs in eight innings, his top score being 31*.

===West Indies: 1896–97===
Hawke toured the West Indies in 1896–97. He appeared in seven first-class matches but failed badly with the bat, totalling only 113 runs in nine innings with a top score of 26; he held three catches. The all-amateur team was not strong, its best known players being Hawke, Warner and H. D. G. Leveson-Gower.

===Argentina: 1911–12===
In the early months of 1912, Hawke took an MCC team to Argentina where three matches against the national team were classified first-class and Hawke played in two of these. After that, Hawke made a couple of appearances for MCC in matches against minor counties, the last in June 1914.

===Summary of Test career===
Hawke played for England in five Test matches, all of them in South Africa: three in 1896 and two in 1899. Apart from his debut Test at St George&#x27;s Oval, Port Elizabeth in February 1896, when England were led by Tim O&#x27;Brien, Hawke captained the team. He was always on the winning side. Although he was a successful Test captain, Hawke&#x27;s contribution as an England batsman was modest. He scored only 55 runs in eight innings at an average of just 7.85 with a highest score of 30; and he held 3 catches.

==Administrative career==

Hawke&#x27;s administrative career began in 1898 when, following the death of Michael Ellison, he was elected to succeed him as Yorkshire President and remained in office for forty years, in the first twelve of which he was also the Yorkshire team captain. He formed a successful liaison with Frederick Toone, who was club secretary from 1902 until his death in June 1930. Hawke praised Toone for increasing the membership from 3,000 in 1903 to over 7,000 ten years later. They worked together to further improve the terms and conditions of the professional players&#x27; contracts. To 1914, they were paid £5 for a home match and £6 for an away match with a £1 win bonus. Players who had received their county cap were obliged to join the Cricketers&#x27; Friendly Society and were paid the winter wage of £2 a week.

In 1898, Hawke publicly criticised the England team selection system which was done by the appropriate ground authority ahead of the next Test match. Hawke advocated creation of a central selection committee and, soon afterwards, the MCC committee agreed with his proposal. Hawke himself was appointed chairman of the inaugural selection panel in 1899, although he was still playing for Yorkshire. He held the post until he retired in 1909, incorporating five Test series. He was reappointed in 1933 and served for one year.

In 1914, Hawke was appointed president of MCC, normally an annual position, but he was asked to remain in the post till the end of the First World War. As a result, Hawke was MCC president for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler Henry Forster, who shortly afterwards succeeded to the title of Lord Forster of Lepe. Throughout the war, Lord&#x27;s was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; view, Hawke was &quot;the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution&quot;.

At the Yorkshire club&#x27;s Annual General Meeting in 1925: Hawke made a famous statement that has often been both quoted and misquoted:
&quot;Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England. I love and admire them all, but we have always had an amateur skipper and when the day comes when we shall have no more amateurs captaining England it will be a thousand pities&quot;.

This outburst was in response to an article in the &quot;Weekly Dispatch&quot; newspaper by Lancashire off-spinner Cec Parkin, described by establishment figures as a &quot;cricketing Bolshevik&quot;, in which Parkin argued that the professional Jack Hobbs should captain England instead of the establishment amateur Arthur Gilligan. It was an embarrassing incident which Pelham Warner, as editor of &quot;The Cricketer&quot;, did his best to explain away. Coldham maintains that what Hawke really meant to say was that it would be a pity if there was no amateur good enough to play for England. He excuses Hawke by asserting that he was accident-prone with &quot;a talent for tripping himself up&quot; by speaking too impulsively; and so &quot;could behave like a complete ass in public&quot;.

In fact, Hawke was incorrect when he said England had &quot;always had an amateur skipper&quot;. The convention of having an amateur captain effectively began with himself in the 1890s but, before that, England had been captained by James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury: all professionals, but only on overseas tours, so it is possible that Hawke was referring to the captaincy in home Tests. Hawke did not live to see Len Hutton become the next professional England captain but he did see Wally Hammond, a former professional, turn amateur so that he could captain England, and Hawke reportedly supported Hammond&#x27;s appointment.

Yet Hawke had a different view about the captaincy of Yorkshire as, in 1927, he advocated the appointment of the professional batsman Herbert Sutcliffe to the post. A controversy arose and Sutcliffe declined the offer with the result that William Worsley, another amateur, was appointed instead. Controversy was not Sutcliffe&#x27;s only reason as he could see that a professional captain would not be given the freedom to lead the team as he wished. Sutcliffe had been very disappointed a few years earlier when Jack Hobbs had refused the England captaincy and he subsequently told Bill Bowes that &quot;Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there&quot;, raising his hand from knee to shoulder height, &quot;the professional cricketers lifted it to there&quot;, raising his hand above his head, &quot;and even Lord Hawke always wanted it back again&quot;. Sutcliffe concluded by saying that Hobbs should have accepted the England captaincy for the sake of professional cricket.

Hawke succeeded Lord Harris as MCC Treasurer in 1932 and remained in both this post and the presidency of Yorkshire until his death in 1938. He soon faced criticism for his lack of response to calls from the Australian Board of Control about the &quot;bodyline&quot; controversy in the 1932–33 tour. Swanton said that Hawke, along with his right-hand man Sir Stanley Jackson, needed &quot;a lot of convincing that the English tactics constituted a menace to the game which demanded action&quot;. In Swanton&#x27;s view (1986), &quot;Hawke&#x27;s place in cricket history derives more from... (Yorkshire cricket and touring activities) ...than from any outstanding service to MCC as such&quot;. But Hawke as an administrator had considerable influence on events and Swanton also wrote that, though he was never among the great players, Hawke &quot;must stand with Thomas Lord, William Clarke and W. G. Grace among influences on the development of the game&quot;. A contemporary view of Hawke&#x27;s position in the game was expressed by Grace in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot; (1899) when he wrote that &quot;Hawke still influences what I call the &quot;politics&quot; of the game&quot;.

In one of its tributes to Hawke, &quot;Wisden&quot; said:
&quot;Besides being a great cricketer in the highest sense of the word, (Hawke) was an administrator who not only aimed at the general welfare of the game, but sought to preserve in it an untarnished ethical code. To him cricket was more a game. It was a philosophy that coloured his dealings with people and things&quot;.

In those dealings, Hawke was never comfortable as a public speaker and is said to have loathed making speeches. Coldham wrote that &quot;his blunders on numerous public forums were to blight his declining years&quot;. The converse of this was that Hawke had personal charm and tact which were assets to him in small groups or with individuals.

==Style and personality==
Hawke was a middle order batsman of reasonable quality who was generally considered good enough to play for the Gentlemen and may have under-achieved as a batsman, perhaps owing to the pressures of captaincy. He was noted for his on-side drive, which was his favourite stroke.
His highest career score was the 166 which he scored for Yorkshire against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1896 when Yorkshire totalled a record 887 and he shared with Peel a record eighth wicket partnership of 292. Hawke took part in another record partnership in 1898 when he and David Hunter put on 148 for the tenth wicket against Kent. He played in 633 first-class matches and had 936 innings, including 105 in which he was not out, scoring 16,749 runs at an average of 20.15. He completed 13 centuries and 69 half-centuries.

As a fielder, Hawke generally took up position in the midfield or deep areas. &quot;Wisden&quot; editor Hubert Preston recalled Hawke&#x27;s &quot;speed and sure picking up&quot; when fielding. Hawke held 209 catches in his first-class career. He was never a bowler and, in his entire first-class career, bowled just 5 four-ball overs, conceding 0–16 at nearly a run a ball.

Writing during Hawke&#x27;s career, K. S. Ranjitsinhji in his &quot;Jubilee Book of Cricket&quot; (1897) describes Hawke as &quot;a capital leader of men&quot;. The measure of his success as a captain was that Yorkshire under his leadership won the County Championship title 8 times. Hawke was an archetypal amateur gentleman playing at a time when professionals were generally viewed as second-class citizens but Hawke, who had great admiration for the professional cricketers in his charge was determined to improve their status and give them respectability. He insisted on discipline and neatness from his professionals and, in return, he gave them a financial stability they had formerly lacked. He instituted winter pay after the 1896 season, initially £2 per week, and established a merit system which resulted in payment of bonuses. In the longer term, he persuaded the club committee to retain and invest for the player two-thirds of his benefit money instead of handing him the whole amount to spend freely. Above all, wrote Swanton, he &quot;deserves to be remembered for what he did for the pros&quot;. Hawke&#x27;s financial policies were a great success at Yorkshire and his legacy was a general improvement in the finances and status of professional players everywhere as other counties followed his lead. W. G. Grace in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot; (1899) commented that Hawke &quot;succeeded in introducing an &quot;esprit de corps&quot; and a standard of discipline, from the absence of which the county had been suffering&quot;. Grace added that Hawke &quot;is a splendid captain, inspiring his men by the example he gives them of pluck and resource&quot;.

In a tribute to Hawke&#x27;s captaincy policy, Stanley Jackson wrote:
&quot;A personal interest in each individual player and his welfare, which was then begun and lasted to the end, gained for &quot;His Lordship&quot; a respect and loyalty from every member of the team which I think must have been unique&quot;.

Jackson recalled that when Hawke began his career, Yorkshire had a &quot;completely professional side including players whose names became famous in cricket history&quot;. Hawke soon realised that &quot;such a team of fine natural cricketers, under sympathetic management and firm leadership, would develop into a most formidable and attractive county side&quot;. Jackson points out that:
&quot;This happened: public interest and support throughout Yorkshire followed and continued to increase until today the Yorkshire County Cricket Club with its fine county side, receives probably, the most generous and loyal support of any in the country. Hawke&#x27;s initiative, with the co-operation of an enthusiastic and competent committee, laid the foundation of Yorkshire County Cricket upon which the present position has been built&quot;.

Although he was benevolent in his care of his players, Hawke would not tolerate any action that brought the game into disrepute or was perceived to be outside its &quot;spirit&quot;. When Bobby Peel went out to play under the effects of too much alcohol, Hawke escorted him off the field and, as Peel himself sarcastically noted: &quot;Lord Hawke put his arm round me and helped me off the ground – and out of first-class cricket. What a gentleman!&quot; Hawke always carried himself as he thought a gentleman should and Bill Bowes, who first met him in 1928, recalled his &quot;mannerism of pulling his shoulders back as he spoke, like a sergeant major in the Guards&quot;.

It has been said that cricket was Lord Hawke&#x27;s life whereas to the more talented Jackson, for example, cricket was only his sport. In Birley&#x27;s view, when Hawke joined Yorkshire as an Etonian who had come down from Cambridge, he was &quot;prepared to make cricket the most serious thing – almost the only thing – he did with the rest of his life&quot;. Birley criticised Hawke as an &quot;autocratic, opinionated, utterly self-confident sprig of the aristocracy&quot; and as &quot;a disciple&quot; of his friend Lord Harris. In a later passage, Birley states that Hawke was &quot;not as bright as his idol, Lord Harris, and so less skilful in concealing his ineffable self-satisfaction&quot;. In Hawke&#x27;s autobiography, written in 1924, are comments like: &quot;I believe I have done more than anyone else to raise the standard and self-respect of the splendid paid section of first-class cricketers&quot; and Birley&#x27;s view of the book is that it &quot;must be one of the least modest works ever compiled&quot;.

Hawke had the reputation of being both a strict disciplinarian and a staunch traditionalist but, though he had his faults, he did care passionately about cricket and about the welfare of Yorkshire&#x27;s professional players. &quot;Cricket,&quot; he once wrote, &quot;is a moral lesson in itself, and the classroom is God&#x27;s air and sunshine. Foster it, my brothers, protect it from anything that will sully it, so that it will be in favour with all men&quot;. &quot;Wisden&quot; said that Hawke &quot;always played to win&quot;, but whatever the game, he was &quot;a generous opponent&quot; and &quot;never harbored resentment&quot;.

<text>Lough Egish () is a rural area in County Monaghan, Ireland, which takes its name from the local lake, Lough Egish. It is situated approximately midway between Ballybay, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross.

In 1901, after the Cooperative movement was formed in Ireland by Sir Horace Plunkett, a group comprising ten local farmers set about forming the County Monaghan-based Lough Egish dairy co-operative which was, until the 1980s, independently known as Lough Egish Co-operative and Dairy Society. Lough Egish later merged with the County Cavan-based Killeshandra Co-op Creameries in an effort to consolidate the movement&#x27;s ambitions of becoming the largest milk processing unit in the north midlands region by rationalising the capacity for milk production to form a new company called Lakeland Dairies. The other major milk processing co-operative in the region Bailieboro Co Op was a later addition to the Lakelands Dairies, making the group one of the largest and most successful milk processing companies in Ireland. There is a DVD about Lough Egish; its name is &quot;A Trip To Loch Egish&quot;.

Lough Egish and surrounding areas host a number of national and international brands including Agro Merchants,  Cooltrim Oil Co Ltd, Gaffey Motors, Glanbia, Lakeland Dairies, Lavelle Hardware, Malones, Platinum Tanks, Rangeland Foods and SFS Steel Formed Sections.</text><links>

<doc id="1328639" wikidata="Q5084339" url="?curid=1328639" title="Charley Pollard">
<text>Charlotte Elspeth Pollard, or simply Charley, is a fictional character played by India Fisher in a series of audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, a radio show based on the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She is a young woman from 1930s England, and she is a companion of the Eighth Doctor.

Charley&#x27;s final story with the Eighth Doctor was in the play &quot;The Girl Who Never Was&quot;, however, this play ended with the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s version of the theme tune. The play &quot;The Condemned&quot; confirmed that Charley was rescued by the Sixth Doctor, and she continued to travel with this incarnation until &quot;Blue Forgotten Planet&quot;. Big Finish continued Charley&#x27;s later travels in her own audio series, &quot;Charlotte Pollard&quot;, which had two volumes released in 2014 and 2017.

==Background==
Charley was born on 15 April 1912, the day the &quot;Titanic&quot; sank, and first appears in the play &quot;Storm Warning&quot; (2001). &quot;Storm Warning&quot; takes place in 1930, making her 18 years old at the time.

She was born into a well-to-do family; her mother was Lady Louisa Pollard. Charley has two sisters, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Pollard and Cecelia &quot;Sissy&quot; Pollard., Charley and her siblings grew up in a manor house in Hampshire, looked after by servants.

However, in &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, Charley rebels against this existence; she styles herself as an Edwardian adventuress and runs away from home, seeking excitement. Making an appointment to meet a young man she fancied in Singapore on New Year&#x27;s Day 1931, she stows away on board the Airship R101 disguised as a male member of the crew. There, she meets the Eighth Doctor and together they discover the secret mission the airship is on. At the conclusion of the story, she is rescued from the fated crash of the R101 by the Doctor and taken on board the TARDIS as his newest companion.

There are consequences to the Doctor taking Charley on board, however. According to history, Charley was intended to die in the R101 crash and the Doctor&#x27;s rescue of her causes a temporal paradox. After a while, the web of time begins to break down as anachronisms seep into history and &quot;anti-time&quot; starts to infect the universe, with Charley as both the focus and the gateway. The Time Lords of Gallifrey take notice, and Lord President Romana gives orders to arrest Charley and the Doctor. Charley is willing to sacrifice herself to save the universe, but the Doctor is unable to sacrifice her, taking the forces of anti-time into himself instead. History is then altered so that the paradox of Charley&#x27;s continued existence became part of established history – in other words, the paradox and the resulting consequences, including the change in the timeline, were meant to happen.

However, having absorbed anti-time, the Doctor now is a danger to the universe, and so has to exile himself into a parallel universe where time does not exist. He intended to do so alone, but Charley stows away aboard the TARDIS and follows him into exile. Eventually, the Doctor discovers he is free of the anti-time infection and he and Charley manage to find their way back, accompanied by C&#x27;rizz, a native of that other universe.

It is the later death of C&#x27;rizz that prompts Charley&#x27;s decision to leave the TARDIS. She quickly changes her mind but due to a series of events involving Cybermen as well as temporal shifts and memory loss, she ultimately parts company with the Doctor. While he believes she has voluntarily left him, Charley actually ends up marooned on an island in the year 500002, believing that the Doctor had died in his confrontation with the Cybermen. She builds a makeshift crystal telegraph and sends an SOS repeatedly into space, hoping that anyone, particularly the Doctor, would rescue her. When her message is finally answered, it turns out to be the Sixth Doctor who saves her. Charley chose to continue travelling with this earlier incarnation, keeping the circumstances of her past and his future a secret from him. This leads the Doctor to grow suspicious of her secrecy and poorly devised lies.

Eventually she runs afoul of a secret TARDIS inhabitant named Mila, who swaps places with her. Charley is infected with a virus rendering her invisible and non-corporeal while Mila pretends to be her. Of the dozens of companions Mila has secretly encountered, Charley is the only one she could infect, because she&#x27;s the only companion the TARDIS refused to protect from infections. It is implied that the TARDIS hates Charley because of her multiple temporal paradoxes. Charley is cured by the mysterious Viyrans and she spends years helping in their mission to rid the universe of certain viruses. Finally, she finds the Sixth Doctor again, still traveling with Mila who is still pretending to be Charley. But Mila dies saving the Doctor&#x27;s life and Charley takes the opportunity to finally set the web of time straight. She asks the Viyrans to alter the Doctor&#x27;s memories so that all the adventures they shared would be remembered with Mila&#x27;s name and true appearance. This way, years later, when the Eighth Doctor meets Charley, he&#x27;ll believe it to be their first encounter. What happens to Charley after she leaves the Sixth Doctor is unclear, but it seems she continues to work for the Viyrans.

Charley&#x27;s exuberant personality matched the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s well. She embraced the wonders of the universe that traveling with the Doctor showed her and helped the Doctor fight the evils he encountered with courage. She was not only loyal to the Doctor, but also developed romantic feelings for him and eventually confessed them. The Doctor was very fond of Charley, and admitted later that she was his friend and he loved her, but what that meant for a virtually immortal Time Lord was unclear, as the relationship between the two was not a physical one.

==Other appearances==
Charley has also appeared in the short story &quot;Repercussions...&quot; by Gary Russell in the anthology &quot;Short Trips: Repercussions&quot;, set a short time after she began travelling with the Doctor.

Members of Charley&#x27;s family have also appeared in Doctor Who stories. Her mother, Lady Louisa (voiced by Anneke Wills) featured in &quot;Zagreus&quot;, &quot;The Next Life&quot;, and &quot;Memory Lane&quot;. Her sister, Cecilia, (also voiced by India Fisher) featured in &quot;Gallifrey: A Blind Eye&quot;, where she is presented as a member of the League of English Fascists; Cecilia ultimately commits suicide after a complex encounter with Leela and Romana forces her to recognize the monster she has become. Charley&#x27;s other sister, Margaret, appears– along with Lady Louisa and Charley&#x27;s father– in the short story collection &quot;The Centenarian&quot;.

In the third issue of the ongoing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic book series from IDW Publishing (2009), Charley is mentioned by the Shadow Architect and the Tenth Doctor as an instance where the Doctor has interfered with a static point in time.

In the bonus tracks to the Companion Chronicle &quot;Solitaire&quot;, it was revealed that Charley would get her own series picking up from the events of &quot;Blue Forgotten Planet&quot;. &quot;Charlotte Pollard&quot; was released in two series, in 2014 and 2017. A third series was announced, but , it is yet to be released.

Before regenerating into the War Doctor in &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;, the Eighth Doctor mentions Charley, marking the first time that any of the Big Finish audio series has been directly referenced in the television show.

She is also in the Big Finish 50th-anniversary multi-Doctor special &quot;The Light at the End&quot;, briefly meeting the Fourth Doctor and Leela before the current threat temporarily erases the Fourth and Eighth Doctors both from history.

<doc id="1328640" wikidata="Q5498342" url="?curid=1328640" title="Frederick Ma">
<text>Frederick Ma Si-hang is a Hong Kong politician and administrator who was chairman of the MTR Corporation from 2015 to 2019. 

As a former Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, he was a popular figure with the public and with legislators of all parties. He is the cousin of entertainer Eric Tsang and uncle of evangelist Jaeson Ma.

== Biography ==
Ma was born the eldest of four children on 22 February 1952, and his father died when Ma was in his teens. He attended New Method College in Tai Hang, where his academic results were &quot;less than fantastic&quot;. However, whilst there, he won an inter-school project for Hong Kong tourism. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and History with Third-class Honours at the University of Hong Kong.

He graduated in 1973, dreaming of working for Cathay Pacific. As he was due to attend a second interview with the airline, Chase Manhattan made an offer with a promised starting salary of HK$1,600. He accepted the job with the bank, and was relocated to New York three years later. At 27, he became Group Head of Chase Manhattan, in charge of institutional banking. After Chase, he became Chief Financial Officer of PCCW.

=== Government years ===
Giving up an annual salary of in excess of HK$10 million, Ma joined the government as a &#x27;cabinet-level&#x27; political appointee under the Principal Officials Accountability System since 1 July 2002.

Ma declared himself to be a Christian in 2002, and was affectionately known in Hong Kong as &quot;Fat Ma&quot; because of his portly physique.

He served as Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury for a term of five years. In 2007, after Donald Tsang re-elected as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Ma continued in SAR government, served as Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development. On 24 June 2008, Ma resigned from the government for health reasons. He was diagnosed with &quot;cavernous hemangioma&quot; and &quot;venous angioma&quot; (blood vessel tumours) in the brain.

=== Subsequent years ===
In October 2008, Ma took up an honorary professorship at the School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong. During his time out, he took up a regime of exercise and lost 17 pounds, to finally weigh 180 pounds.

In 2009, he was invited to the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation. He was awarded a Gold Bauhinia Star. It was announced in early November that Ma had been named the new non-executive chairman of China Strategic Holdings ; Raymond Or was named the company&#x27;s vice-chairman and CEO. The company&#x27;s shares, which were suspended pending the announcement, closed 78 percent higher when they were relisted.

Ma was appointed Justice of the Peace in 2010.

In July 2015, Ma was named the chairman of the MTR Corporation, a position he held until 2019. He became chairman of the Education University of Hong Kong&#x27;s governing council on 25 April 2017, by appointment of the Chief Executive. His three-year term expired in 2020.

<text>Ice hockey rules define the parameters of the sport of ice hockey. The sport is governed by several organizations including the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the National Hockey League (NHL), Hockey Canada, USA Hockey and others. The rules define the size of the hockey rink where a game is played, the playing and safety equipment, the game definition, including time of play and whether tie-breaking methods are used and the actual playing rules themselves. The IIHF rule book is used in both amateur and professional leagues worldwide. The NHL&#x27;s rule book is the basis for the rule books of most North American professional leagues. The IIHF, amateur and NHL rules evolved separately from amateur and professional Canadian ice hockey rules of the early 1900s.

Hockey Canada rules define the majority of the amateur games played in Canada. USA Hockey defines the same for the United States (US). US high school leagues use the National Federation of State High School Associations rule book, and varsity college hockey is governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s rules.

Hockey Canada and USA Hockey&#x27;s rule books differ primarily in technical matters such as the severity of penalties handed out for various fouls. IIHF rules differ a bit more due to the differences in the dimensions of North American hockey rinks from those in the rest of the world. In recent times, both USA Hockey and Hockey Canada have been trying to make their rules more similar to the international rules. The merits of this move toward a more standardized rule book, however, are debated in amateur hockey circles.

In recent years, the low scores of NHL games have prompted the league to debate a wide variety of rule change proposals including enlarging the size of the goal, widening the blue and red lines to create a larger offensive zone, restricting where goaltenders can handle the puck, breaking ties with a penalty shot shootout, and eliminating the two-line pass rule.

<text>Vital Brazil Mineiro da Campanha, known as Vital Brazil (April 28, 1865 – May 8, 1950), was a Brazilian physician, biomedical scientist and immunologist, known for the discovery of the polyvalent anti-ophidic serum used to treat bites of venomous snakes of the &quot;Crotalus&quot;, &quot;Bothrops&quot; and &quot;Elaps&quot; genera. He went on to be also the first to develop anti-scorpion and anti-spider serums. He was the founder of the Butantan Institute, a research center located in São Paulo, which was the first in the world dedicated exclusively to basic and applied toxicology, the science of venomous animals.

==Life==
Vital Brazil Mineiro da Campanha was born on April 28, 1865, in the town of Campanha, in the state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern of the Empire of Brazil. His father gave him this curious name in homage to the country, the state and the city where he was born, as well as from the date, St. Vital’s Day.

He graduated from the Rio de Janeiro School of Medicine in 1891, working as a technical assistant in the chair of Physiology in order to pay for his tuition and living expenses. After graduating, he began work in public health, initially as a sanitary inspector in São Paulo (1892–1895), where he acquired experience in the prevalent epidemic diseases of the time (smallpox, typhoid fever, yellow fever and cholera), and then as a private practitioner in the city of Botucatu, from 1895 to 1896.

Vital Brazil was attracted by medical research in the growing fields of bacteriology, virology and immunology at the end of the 19th century, which were being fueled by the great discoveries in Europe, by Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, Paul Ehrlich and many others. In 1896, when he was still working in Botucatu, Vital Brazil became specially interested in snake incidents and began his studies on snake poisoning, also keeping a scientific collection of snakes stored in alcohol.

He therefore returned to São Paulo in 1897 and accepted a position in the Instituto Bacteriológico de São Paulo (&quot;Bacteriological Institute of São Paulo&quot;), under direction of the great Brazilian pathologist and epidemiologist Adolfo Lutz. There, he worked on the preparation of sera against several diseases, particularly bubonic plague, of which he fell gravely ill, fortunately surviving it.

Due to his outstanding work, the government of São Paulo founded a new Serum Therapy Institute in 1901 and gave its directorship to Vital Brazil. He also founded the Institute of Hygiene, Serum Therapy and Veterinary Medicine in the city of Niterói, in 1919, which is called today Vital Brazil Institute (Instituto Vital Brazil).

Vital Brazil carried out scientific travels to Europe in 1904 and 1914 and to 1925 to the United States. He continued working at the Butantan Institute for several decades until his retirement in 1919. He died on May 8, 1950, celebrated as one of the most important Brazilian scientists ever.

==Work==
The new São Paulo Institute was built in a section of the city named Butantan, at the time a far-away place, near the Pinheiros river, a swampy, sparsely inhabited area. Under Vital Brazil, it soon became an energetic and exemplary research center in vaccines and sera of all kinds, which were produced locally for the prophylaxis and treatment of tetanus, diphtheria, yellow fever, smallpox and several zoonoses (diseases transmitted to humans by animals), such as the dreaded hydrophobia. The Institute came to be well known by his original name, the Butantan Institute, and is still active today.

Vital Brazil was convinced since his early work at Butantan that envenomations (poisoning by accidents with venomous animals, such as snakes, scorpions, spiders and batrachia, then the cause of thousands of deaths in Brazil) could be fought with antisera, i.e., antibodies specifically produced for venoms which were proteins or long-chain peptides. A French immunologist, Albert Calmette (1863–1933) had demonstrated this for the first time in 1892, by developing a monovalent serum to treat bites by the Indian cobra (&quot;Naja tripudians&quot;).

Vital Brazil thus began a series of experimental investigations, and in 1901 he was able to prove that monovalent sera against the Asiatic species were ineffective against South American snakes, and proceeded to develop his first monovalent sera against the most common envenomations in Brazil, those produced by the &quot;Bothrops&quot;, &quot;Crotalus&quot; and &quot;Elapidae&quot; genera (represented respectively by the jararaca snake, the rattlesnake, and the coral snake). He found several clinical and biochemical similarities between bothropic and crotalic envenomations and so he was the first to achieve a polyvalent serum, i.e., simultaneously effective against both species, which represented a triumph over the stark mortality caused by these species in North, Central and South America. In a few decades, this mortality, which was higher than 25% to 20% of bitten people, fell to less than 2%.

Applying the same techniques (which involved gradual immunization of horses and sheep by administering small doses of venoms, and then extracting, purifying and freeze-drying the antibody portion from the blood of injected animals), Vital Brazil and his coworkers were able to discover the first sera against two species of scorpions&#x27; (1908) and spiders&#x27; (1925) venoms. In the USA, Vital Brazil&#x27;s name made the headlines when he used his serum to save the life of a worker in the Bronx Zoo in New York City who was bitten by a rattlesnake.

Most important of all, the Butantan Institute became a fertile school for breeding a new generation of Brazilian biochemists, physiologists and pathologists, such as José Moura Gonçalves, Carlos Ribeiro Diniz, Gastão Rosenfeld, Wilson Teixeira Beraldo and Maurício Rocha e Silva, who went on to found a growing number of schools, departments and research laboratories in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, giving a great impetus to the development of medical and biological research and teaching in Brazil in the second half of the 20th century.

According to Bernardo Houssay, who wrote a well-cited biography of Vital Brazil in 1966, his contributions went further than herpetology:&quot;Vital Brazil and his collaborators have studied several actions of the venoms, (such as) coagulant, anticoagulant, hemolytic, agglutinant, cytotoxic, proteolytic, etc. (...) The (animal) poisons contain numerous enzymes which have been isolated and studied with interest in all parts since they explain many of the symptoms and constitute interesting biochemical reagents, Vital Brazil studied also the ophiophagous serpents, such as the mussurana, the ophiophagous mammals, such as the skunk-like &quot;Conepatus chilensis&quot; and others, the ophiophagous birds and certain spiders. (...) His book, &quot;La défense contre l’ophidisme&quot; published in French in 1914, attained international repercussion with three editions.&quot;

==Legacy==
Vital Brazil is commemorated in the scientific names of four species of South American snakes:
*&quot;Rhachidelus brazili&quot; 
*&quot;Drymoluber brazili&quot; 
*&quot;Bothrops brazili&quot; 
*&quot;Chironius brazili&quot;

<text>Old Armenian Town in Fresno, California, is a former enclave of Armenian immigrants. Community gathering places include the Armenian Community Center on Ventura Street and the Holy Trinity Armenian Apostolic Church. There are also restaurants and delis that specialize in Armenian cuisine.

As of 2020, there were plans to redevelop the area. The new project, also dubbed &quot;Old Armenian Town&quot; is to contain a courthouse for California&#x27;s Fifth Appellate District Court of Appeals, a major multi-story commercial office building, and an Armenian Museum.

There have been renewed efforts for the historic preservation of the neighborhood.

<text>High Legh is a village, civil and ecclesiastical parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It is north west of Knutsford, east of Warrington and south west of Manchester City Centre. The population of the entire civil parish was estimated at 1,705 in 2019.

==History==
Unusually this village was the seat of two ancient landed gentry families for generations, namely: Leigh of West Hall and Cornwall-Legh of East Hall. Both halls have now been demolished, but both families are still represented today, the head of the &quot;West Hall&quot; family being Sir Edward Leigh but no longer associated or living within the parish and that of the &quot;East Hall&quot; family being headed by Richard, 6th Baron Grey of Codnor. A member of a cadet branch of the Leigh of West Hall family was created a baronet in 1773 as Sir Egerton Leigh, but this title is now dormant. Other cadet branches were the Leigh-Traffords of nearby Oughtrington Hall as well as the Barons Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire and the Barons Newton of Lyme Park. The third lordship of the manor was held by the Egerton family of Tatton and all three landed families swapped and consolidated their estates throughout the 18th and 19th centuries until the Egerton Leighs sold their High Legh estate to the Cornwall-Leghs just before World War I. When Maurice, 4th and last Lord Egerton of Tatton, sold off the remaining farms and land in High Legh in the 1930s, so ended a connection dating back to the 13th century.

East Hall was demolished in the early 1970s (as West Hall had been some 20 years previously) and the debris was used as foundations for the first Thelwall viaduct bridge of the M6. High Legh Hall (the East Hall) resembled nearby Tatton Park and the West Hall (Egerton Leigh family) was a beautiful Tudor building similar architecturally to Little Moreton Hall.

In a mainly agricultural area, its proximity to Manchester and the area now known as &quot;Gold Trafford&quot; has made it nowadays a desirable residential area.

High Legh was recorded in the Domesday Survey as having two Saxons theins (Ulviet or Wulfgeat, and Dob). The boundary between Mere and High Legh is still known as Dobb Lane and is, in fact, the medieval boundary between the two parishes. A moated site has been found, alongside the Roman road which connected Wilderspool and Latchford, Cheshire to Watling Street (A556) which contained Samian pottery from Cirencester, a Roman cloak clasp, and a flint knife. High Legh was also a high-status Bronze Age burial site. High Legh is the location of an early Methodist chapel in Northwood Lane, with Wesleyan connections. Northwood Methodist Chapel was founded by the Okell family of High Legh (who married into the Egerton Leigh (&quot;West Hall&quot;) family). In the early 19th century, Robert Moffat, a young Scottish man, came to work on the West Hall estate as a gardener, but in 1814 he joined the London Missionary Society and moved to Plantation Farm in Dukinfield. In 1816 he left with his wife for southern Africa where he became a missionary; his daughter met and fell in love with their student preacher, David Livingstone. The oldest building in the parish is believed to be St Mary&#x27;s Chapel, formerly the domestic chapel of the Cornwall-Legh family of High Legh Hall (or East Hall), which is sometimes open to the public. However, other older buildings in the parish contain wattle and daub but no evidence of their dates has yet been established.
The Anglican Church of St John was formerly the domestic chapel of the &quot;Leighs of West Hall&quot; (Egerton Leigh family).

The park of East Hall, High Legh was laid out by Humphrey Repton for George John Legh in 1791, and John Nash was also engaged to create an idyll village, but this was never completed. Repton removed the old toll road (the original Roman road) and dropped it to its present position (the A50), removing the village and creating a more enclosed entrance to the estate and pleasure gardens.

Both mansions were used by the government for the training of Royal Engineers during World War II after the families moved out; they never returned to their respective halls and subsequently sold the internal section of the estate to two building companies, Wimpey Homes, and Crossley Homes. In the 1980s more of the estate pleasure gardens was sold off for housing to Ideal Homes. In the 1990s another estate was built on the former Army camp buildings, now known as The Belfry. All the street names in these developments have a connection with the history of High Legh through either one of the ancient landed families (Legh &amp; Leigh), prominent people within the parish or parts of the former park (Pheasant Walk).

==Transport==
On 10 October 2009, High Legh Railway (a gauge railway) was opened by Louise Robbins (Headteacher of High Legh Primary School). On 26 November 2011, the railway was extended further making the route a little short of . The extension was opened by Harold Brooks (in the guise of Father Christmas) and Frank Sidebottom from the 7 Inch Gauge Society; High Legh Railway is operated by Vee Limited. The railway is the brainchild of Andrew John Higgins

==Education==
There have been three schools in High Legh. The one within the triangle on the side of the A50 is now High Legh Village Hall, managed by High Legh Community Association. The latest school (with new extensions 1993–94) was built on Wrenshot Lane in 1976; this land was donated by Charles Cornwall-Legh (&quot;later&quot; Lord Grey of Codnor) to Cheshire County Council.

==Sport==
The village now has several sporting facilities including High Legh Cricket Club which plays at Arley Hall the home of the Viscount Ashbrook, golf at High Legh Park Country Club on land formerly part of the West Hall estate, High Legh Bowling Club, opposite the Village Hall and High Legh Tennis Club.
In 2008 an annual early season 10K running race was started, called the High Legh Robert Moffat Memorial 10K race. It has developed into a very popular local race. The race is jointly organised by High Legh Community Association and Lymm Runners Running Club
