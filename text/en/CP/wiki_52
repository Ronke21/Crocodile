<text>The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) is the agency of the state government responsible for transportation in the state of Virginia in the United States. VDOT is headquartered at the Virginia Department of Highways Building in downtown Richmond. VDOT is responsible for building, maintaining, and operating the roads, bridges, and tunnels in the commonwealth. It is overseen by the Commonwealth Transportation Board, which has the power to fund airports, seaports, rail, and public transportation.

VDOT&#x27;s revised annual budget for fiscal year 2019 is $5.4 billion.

VDOT has a workforce of about 7,500 full-time employees.

== Responsibilities ==

Virginia has the nation&#x27;s third largest system of state-maintained highways, after North Carolina and Texas. The Virginia highway system totals approximately 58,000 miles of interstate, primary, frontage, and secondary roads. The system includes about 20,000 bridges and structures. In addition, independent cities and towns, as well as the counties of Henrico and Arlington, maintain approximately 12,000 miles of local streets, and receive funds from the state for that purpose.

VDOT operates and maintains:

* Roads: VDOT&#x27;s largest responsibility is the maintenance of roads. Filling potholes, storm drain cleaning, water drainage, guard rail replacement, bridge work, tree removal, and trash removal, as well as the maintenance of signs and traffic lights.
* More than 21,000 bridges and structures
* Snow removal: VDOT is responsible for removing snow along the major roads of Virginia.
* Forty-one safety rest areas and ten welcome centers along major highways
*More than 100 commuter parking lots
*Four underwater crossings in the Hampton Roads area:
**The mid-town Elizabeth River tunnel
**The downtown Elizabeth River tunnel
**The Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel on Interstate 64
**The Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel on Interstate 664

*Two mountain tunnels on Interstate 77 in southwest Virginia:
**East River Mountain Tunnel
**Big Walker Mountain Tunnel
* Two toll roads:
** Fairfax County&#x27;s Dulles Toll Road (operated and maintained by MWAA)
** The Powhite Parkway Extension near Richmond
*One toll bridge: The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge
*Three ferry services:
** Jamestown Ferry
** Sunny Bank
** Merry Point

== Budget ==
Highway maintenance and operations represent 41% of the total budget, followed by 32% for highway systems construction. Smaller portions of the budget are directed to address the needs and requirements of debt service, support to other agencies, administration, and earmarks and special financing.

=== District Notes ===
== 511 ==

Many US states, as well as several US local governments and Canadian provinces, provide 511 systems. VDOT provides the Virginia 511 service, which may be accessed by the 511 telephone number, the https://www.511.vdot.virginia.gov website, and Twitter. In May 2012, VDOT introduced the Virginia 511 smartphone apps for Apple and Android devices. The Virginia 511 system provides traffic cameras, real-time road and traffic conditions, trip planning, weather information, and alternatives to traveling by car.

== Controversies ==

=== Closing of rest areas ===
In July 2009, VDOT closed 19 of its rest areas around the state, leaving some stretches of highway, such as I-81 which is a popular route for trucks, or the heavily traveled and often congested I-95 northbound between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, a distance of , without a rest stop. Drivers complained that people who needed to use the restroom would have nowhere to go. VDOT countered that the I-95 corridor is highly developed, and many businesses have restrooms, and that closing the rest stops would save VDOT 9 million dollars toward its 2.6 billion dollar budget deficit.

In January 2010, governor Bob McDonnell announced that he would reopen all of the closed rest areas as part of his campaign promises. The state is using an &quot;adopt a rest stop&quot; program, pulling 3 million dollars from the reserve maintenance fund, and employing non-violent inmates to help reopen the rest stops. They all reopened on April 17, 2010.

=== Roadside memorials ===

Spontaneous roadside memorials, often in the form of white crosses, Stars of David, bouquets of flowers, and photos of the dead, have been placed along roads at the scenes of fatal accidents. As of July 1, 2003, Virginia law has banned these memorials. Transportation officials have deemed them a threat to the safety of motorists.

Virginia law §33.2-216 prohibits any person from installing a memorial on any highway controlled by the VDOT without a permit. VDOT will install a roadside memorial sign, normally for a period of two years. The sign may not deviate from the standard roadside memorial sign specifications. The cost must by paid by the person requesting the sign.

Not everyone agreed with the new program. Vowing to ignore the program, Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William), whose son was killed in an auto accident along Interstate 81 in November 2001, said:

:This is the bureaucratization of love. I don&#x27;t like it one bit. I intend to put a cross up for my son. Period.

By marking an accident site, survivors create &quot;a living memory of this person&#x27;s life,&quot; said Donna Schuurman, president of Association for Death Education and Counseling. Americans have swept the grieving process under the rug, and now it&#x27;s popping up in public ways that few expected—and that some don&#x27;t like, according to Ms. Schuurman.

=== HOT lanes ===

In 1995, Virginia passed the Public-Private Transportation Act (PPTA), which allows the state to enter into agreements with private entities to construct, improve, maintain and operate transportation facilities. Since then, Virginia has proposed or awarded several PPTA contracts, including:

*Capital Beltway (I-495) HOT Lanes (Completed in November 2012)
**14 miles of four HOV/HOT lanes on the Capital Beltway between the Springfield Interchange and just north of the Dulles Toll Road
*I-95 / I-395 HOT Lanes (proposed)
**56 miles from the Pentagon to Spotsylvania County
***The HOT lanes were complete in December 2014, but the lanes stretch from just north of Edsall Road to Garrisonville

High-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) are toll lanes operating alongside existing highway lanes. They provided drivers with a faster and more reliable travel option. Buses, carpools, motorcycles and emergency vehicles will be able to use the HOT lanes for free while drivers with fewer than three occupants can use the HOT lanes by paying a toll. The HOT lanes will use dynamic or congestion pricing to manage the number vehicles, and to keep them free-flowing. On average, vehicles are expected to be traveling 55 miles per hour, even during peak travel times.

The first HOT Lanes in the nation to open was the 91 Express Lanes project in Orange County, California, opening in December 1995. A computer adjusts the toll every six minutes, raising it if too many cars are on the highway, lowering it if the highway is underutilized. Even drivers who will not pay the toll appreciate the HOT lanes diverting traffic form the regular highway.

But many people are not happy about the proposed HOT lanes in Northern Virginia. In 2001, Maryland governor Parris N. Glendening (D) stopped a state study of similar proposals for the Maryland side of the Capital Beltway. The governor believed it would be unfair to low-income residents to allow affluent drivers to buy their way out of traffic.

In 2003, Virginia Department of Transportation Commissioner Philip A. Shucet stated that &quot;[s]ingle drivers could pay $1 to $4 to get off of the congested regular lanes.&quot; By 2009, transportation planners in Washington estimated the projected rush-hour toll need to be $1.60 a mile. According to VDOT&#x27;s web site:

There will be no toll cap, as tolls must be able to increase to the level necessary to manage real-time traffic demand and keep the lanes congestion free.

Those who own property along the path of the Capital Beltway HOT Lanes are growing increasingly agitated with the project. Supervisor Sharon Bulova (D-Braddock), who represents a number of neighborhoods affected by the construction, said:

Once the project is truly underway, eventually pretty much all the trees in the VDOT right of way are going to be cleared ... I know I didn&#x27;t have an appreciation of the extent of the clearing that was going to be done ... Do they really need to clear every teeny piece of vegetation in their right of way?

== History ==
The Virginia General Assembly established the first State Highway Commission in 1906.

In 1927, the Virginia Department of Highways (VDH) was established as a state agency.

VDH became the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation (VDHT) in 1974, adding railroads and public transportation to its portfolio.

In 1986, the General Assembly authorized expanded revenue sources for transportation, including airports and seaports. Also during that same special session, the General Assembly formally renamed the agency the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT).

The General Assembly spun off VDOT&#x27;s rail and public transportation into a new department, the Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DPRT). DPRT reports directly to the Virginia Secretary of Transportation.

<doc id="1336098" wikidata="Q7767243" url="?curid=1336098" title="The Sum of All Fears (video game)">
<text>The Sum of All Fears is a 2002 tactical shooter video game which is developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubi Soft. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 (only released in Europe) and GameCube, based on the &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; game engine; another version was released for the Game Boy Advance.

The game is based on the 2002 film of the same name. It is a tactical first-person shooter game and is very similar in style to that of the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; series of games.

==Plot==

The game&#x27;s first two missions take place sometime during the film, in which the FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) works to save hostages in a Charleston, West Virginia television station, and shut down operations from a West Virginian militia calling themselves the &quot;Mountain Men&quot;. From the third mission on, John Clark recruits the team to work for the CIA and has the operatives work on seeking out and killing the conspirators behind an incident in Baltimore, Maryland, in which a nuclear bomb has been detonated during an American football game, killing a large number of people.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; uses a simplified way of gameplay from the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; series. There is no planning phase for missions; instead the player&#x27;s three-man team executes a pre-planned insertion with other anti-terrorist teams controlled solely by the computer. However, the player is free to deviate from the planned route and select their own path. The player also cannot individually select the equipment each team member carries. Instead, the player chooses from a small selection of pre-defined equipment packages for the entire team. On each mission, the player has control of their two teammates, and can take direct control of either of them at any time. The player can also give a few rudimentary commands to the teammates, such as &quot;wait here&quot;, &quot;follow me&quot;, and &quot;clear/grenade/flashbang the next room&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; sold 180,000 copies by September 30, 2002. By the end of 2002, its sales had surpassed 400,000 copies, although Ubisoft had projected sales of only 350,000 by March 2003.

The PC and Game Boy Advance versions received &quot;average&quot; reviews, while the GameCube version received &quot;unfavorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

<text>The Rigi (or &quot;Mount Rigi&quot;; also known as &quot;Queen of the Mountains&quot;) is a mountain massif of the Alps, located in Central Switzerland. The whole massif is almost entirely surrounded by the water of three different bodies of water: Lake Lucerne, Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz. The range is in the Schwyzer Alps, and is split between the cantons of Schwyz and Lucerne, although the main summit, named &quot;Rigi Kulm&quot;, at 1,797 meters above sea level, lies within the canton of Schwyz. The Rigi Kulm Hotel, established in 1816, is located on the summit.

The Rigi Kulm and other areas, such as the resort of Rigi Kaltbad, are served by Europe&#x27;s oldest mountain railways, the Rigi Railways. The whole area offers many activities such as skiing or sledging in the winter, and hiking in the summer.

==Peaks==
==Etymology==

The name &quot;Rigi&quot; is from Swiss Old High German &quot;*rigî&quot; &quot;horizontal stratification, strip, band&quot;, from OHG &quot;rîhan&quot; &quot;gird; pleat, string&quot;, cf. OHG &quot;rîga&quot; &quot;row, stripe, furrow&quot;, after the horizontal rock ledges and grass strips surrounding the mountain from west to east.
The name is first recorded in 1350 as &quot;Riginun&quot;.

The name was interpreted as &quot;Regina montium&quot; &quot;queen of mountains&quot; by Albrecht von Bonstetten (1479), who however gives &quot;Rigena&quot; as alternative form.

Bonstetten&#x27;s interpretation as &quot;Regina&quot; was influential in the 17th century, and was still repeated in 18th-century travelogues. Karl Zay (&quot;Goldau und seine Gegend&quot;, 1807) criticized this latinization, arguing for &quot;mons rigidus&quot; instead. Later in the 19th century, many authors repeated either &quot;rigidus&quot; or &quot;regina&quot; as the name&#x27;s supposed origin. The two possibilities were also adduced as explanation of the name&#x27;s grammatical gender alternating between masculine and feminine.
Brandstetter (&quot;Die Rigi&quot;, 1914) finally discredited these interpretations and established the origin in Old High German &quot;rîga&quot; (whence modern German &quot;Reihe, Reigen&quot;; cognate with English &quot;row&quot;).

==Transport==
There are multiple public transport options available to ascend Mount Rigi:

* By rack railway from Arth-Goldau and Vitznau, operated by the Rigi Bahnen. The Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn started operation on May 21, 1871 and was the first mountain railway in Europe. On June 4, 1875 the Arth-Rigi-Bahn was finished, allowing access from the other side of the mountain. They were electrified in 1937 and 1907 respectively, with the Arth-Rigi-Bahn becoming the first electrified standard gauge rack-railway in the world. Both lines go all the way to the summit, Rigi Kulm.
* By gondola lift from Weggis to Rigi-Kaltbad.
* By cable-car from the Kräbel station on the Arth-Rigi-Bahn line to Rigi-Scheidegg.

== Recreation ==
Mount Rigi offers an area for recreation and sports measuring approximately offering a variety of well-maintained walking trails or mountain hikes where visitors can have a panoramic view of from various marked points. There are also numerous public grilling stations located near the hiking trails.

Rigi is also a destination for people practising winter sports and other winter recreation activities.

== Rigi in culture ==
Rigi has been featured in many works of art, including both paintings and literary publications. Perhaps the most famous paintings of the Rigi were a series by J. M. W. Turner, including &quot;The Blue Rigi, Sunrise&quot;, several of which are in the collection of the Tate Britain art gallery in London.

Mark Twain also visited Rigi during his tour of Central Europe in the late 1870s, and wrote about his travels in chapter 28 of his &quot;A Tramp Abroad&quot;.

There is a Catskills resort called the Rigi Kulm in Abraham Cahan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rise of David Levinsky&quot; (1917).

The Rigi, a downhill road in Wellington, New Zealand, is named for the mountain and for many years was used as a main thoroughfare for coach riders.

On 9 July 1868, during a three-week tour through Switzerland, Gerard Manley Hopkins ascended Rigi-Kulm, the highest peak of the Rigi massif: &quot;From Lucerne by steamer to Küssnacht, thence walk across to Immensee, thence by steamer over lake of Zug to Arth, whence up the Rigi.&quot;

==Geology==
Geologically, the Rigi is not a part of the Alps, and belongs instead to the Swiss plateau. It is mostly composed of molasse and other conglomerate, as opposed to the Bündner schist and flysch of the Alps.

<doc id="1336108" wikidata="Q913558" url="?curid=1336108" title="Bride of Re-Animator">
<text>Bride of Re-Animator is a 1990 American comedy horror film produced and directed by Brian Yuzna and written by Yuzna, Rick Fry, and Woody Keith. It is a sequel to the 1985 film &quot;Re-Animator&quot; and the second entry in the &quot;Re-Animator&quot; film series. Like its predecessor, it is loosely based on the serialized story &quot;Herbert West–Reanimator&quot; (1921-1922) by H. P. Lovecraft. Unlike its predecessor, it was released direct-to-video.

The plot of &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; roughly follows episodes &quot;V. The Horror from the Shadows&quot; and &quot;VI. The Tomb-Legions&quot; of the Lovecraft story, and follows doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain as they attempt to create a living woman from dead tissue. The film stars Bruce Abbott, Claude Earl Jones, Fabiana Udenio, David Gale, and Kathleen Kinmont, with Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot;, released in 2003.

==Plot==
Eight months after the events of &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain are working as medics in the middle of a bloody Peruvian civil war. In the chaos of battle and with plenty of casualties to work on, they are free to experiment with West&#x27;s re-animation reagent. When their medical tent is stormed by the enemy troops, West and Cain return home to Arkham, Massachusetts. There, they resume their former jobs as doctors at Miskatonic University Hospital, and West returns to the basement laboratory of Cain&#x27;s house to continue his research.

Using parts pilfered from both the hospital&#x27;s morgue and from a cemetery located next door, West discovers that his reagent can re-animate body parts by themselves. He becomes determined to create an entire living person from disparate body parts. West discovers the heart of Megan Halsey, Cain&#x27;s fiancée, in the hospital morgue. With the promise to use her heart to re-animate a new Megan, West convinces Cain to help him with his project. Also stored in the morgue is the rest of the evidence from the &quot;Miskatonic Massacre&quot;. Inside, pathologist Dr. Wilbur Graves discovers a vial of West&#x27;s reagent and the severed head of Dr. Carl Hill. Using the reagent, he re-animates Hill&#x27;s head.

Meanwhile, police officer Lt. Leslie Chapham begins investigating West and Cain, as they were the only unaffected survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre; the dead body of Chapham&#x27;s wife was re-animated into a crazed zombie during the incident (it is implied later in the film that he caused her death). Chapham suspects West and Cain were responsible. When he stops by their house to question them, he discovers West&#x27;s corpse-filled lab and the two get into a confrontation. A fight ensues and West kills Chapham by means of cloth treated with a chemical which causes cardiac arrest when inhaled (a product of West&#x27;s research into obtaining the freshest possible corpses for his experiments). West then re-animates the police officer with the intention of covering up his crime. Chapham violently wanders out of the house and into the cemetery next door.

Hill, who bears a grudge against West, uses psychic powers to command Chapham to force Dr. Graves to stitch bat wings onto his neck, giving him back his mobility. He also extends his mental control to all of the zombie survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre.

When one of Cain&#x27;s patients, Gloria, dies, West collects the last piece he needs for his creation: her head. With a complete body stitched and wired together, West and Cain inject the re-animation reagent into Meg&#x27;s heart. While waiting for the reagent to take effect, a package is delivered to their house. West retrieves and opens it. From inside, Hill&#x27;s winged head flies out. Simultaneously, the zombies Hill controls break into the house. West retreats back to the basement lab, where his creation, the Bride, has awoken.

A catfight breaks out between the Bride and Cain&#x27;s current girlfriend, Italian journalist Francesca Danelli, whom he met in Peru. Cain rejects the Bride&#x27;s love and sides with Francesca. Heartbroken, the Bride rips Megan&#x27;s heart out of her own chest and then falls to pieces. West diagnoses this as tissue rejection.

Hill and his zombies force West, Cain and Francesca to retreat through the wall of the lab and into a crypt in the neighboring cemetery. Inside, all of West&#x27;s prior test subjects arise and make their way towards him, stopping only when Herbert commands them to. The unstable crypt begins to collapse, trapping Hill, West and the zombies. Cain and Francesca escape the debris and claw their way to the surface of the cemetery together. Hill is stuck in the debris, while Megan&#x27;s heart, still in the hand of the Bride, stops beating.

==Production==
In an August 1986 interview, &quot;Re-Animator&quot; director Stuart Gordon commented, &quot;If we do a sequel to &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, we&#x27;ll call it &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot;.&quot; He indicated that this title would be in homage to the film &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, adding that he already had several ideas for a sequel and that given the title, Meg Halsey would have to be a key character in it. One idea for a sequel involved Dan Cain taking the job of a building superintendent to surreptitiously continue working on Meg Halsey&#x27;s body at night. When government agents discover his whereabouts, they secret him away to the White House where he is reunited with Herbert West and instructed to reanimate the President of the United States. A similar idea was later used for the unproduced sequel &quot;House of Re-Animator&quot;.

Pre-production on &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; began in early 1989. Production on the film was scheduled to begin on June 5, 1989, which left the filmmakers with less than one month to finalize the script, finish hiring the cast and crew, and get the special effects underway. Jeffrey Combs was initially not going to reprise his role as Herbert West due to a scheduling conflict, as he was already booked to be in Italy for the filming of &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;. However, on May 25, 1989, production on &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; was pushed back, and Combs was immediately cast to return as West.

Director Yuzna considered Patricia Tallman for the role of the Bride, but on May 28, 1989, he selected Kinmont to play the part. Barbara Crampton, who starred in the first &quot;Re-Animator&quot; film, and had appeared with Kinmont in Fraternity Vacation released in 1985, the same year of the first Re-Animator film, did not return for &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot;. A 1991 issue of &quot;Fangoria&quot; reported that Crampton declined to reprise her role due to soap opera obligations. In a 2011 interview, Crampton said that her agent convinced her not to make a cameo appearance in &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot;, as he felt that it was beneath her to have such a minor role.

Principal photography began in June 1989 and wrapped the following month, on July 18. A scene in which Dr. Hill&#x27;s head is found on exhibit at a carnival was shot in mid-June, but this sequence was not included in the finished film.

===Special effects===
Tony Doublin of Doublin FX created the special effects for the eye/finger creature, which involved the use of a rod puppet, a stop-motion puppet, and a stunt hand. Doublin also created the puppet used to portray Francesca&#x27;s dog Angel after West reanimates its corpse and attaches a human arm to it. When not depicted with a puppet, Angel was played by dog actor Friday, who was cast after demonstrating that she could walk with a prosthetic arm. West&#x27;s failed test subjects were designed by Japanese artist Screaming Mad George and his crew, while the effects for Dr. Hill&#x27;s head were created by Mike Deak and Wayne Toth of John Carl Buechler&#x27;s Magical Media Industries.

The special effects for the Bride were created by KNB EFX Group, including Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger. Greg Nicotero, who co-founded KNB EFX with Kurtzman and Berger, was working on the special effects for another film, &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot;, during the pre-production of &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot;. However, Nicotero joined the &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; crew in June 1989, and oversaw the effects during the filming of the sequence in which West and Cain are shown working as wartime medics in a field hospital.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 20 critics, with an average rating of 5.17/10. &quot;Variety&quot; recommended it to fans of the first film, but noted that the abundance of gore &quot;will turn off&quot; mainstream audiences. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; is less a sequel to the critically praised 1985 horror film &quot;Re-Animator&quot; than a rehash based on the same H. P. Lovecraft stories.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a rating of &quot;C+&quot; and called it &quot;an anemic shadow of the first film&quot;.

Patrick Legare of AllMovie gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing that &quot;&quot;Re-Animator&quot; was a tough act to follow, but Brian Yuzna does an admirable job of keeping with the splattery spirit of the original&quot;. In their book &quot;Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft&quot;, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: &quot;&quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; is a silly film that is fun solely for the fevered performance of Jeffrey Combs. Unlike the original &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, &quot;Bride&quot;″s script really suffers from a lack of cohesiveness and undeterminable character motivation.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia&quot;, academic Peter Dendle called it &quot;a pointless and forgettable sequel&quot;. Bruce G. Hallenbeck, in his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot;, criticized the discontinuity from the first film (in particular that Herbert West is alive and Megan Halsey is dead at the beginning, when it was the other way around at the end of &quot;Re-Animator&quot;) and said Yuzna&#x27;s direction pales against &quot;Re-Animator&quot; director Stuart Gordon&#x27;s, but concluded &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; to be a very respectable sequel which &quot;lacks the wit and originality of the first movie but goes even farther into the gruesome concept of re-animation.&quot; He particularly praised the bizarre zombie designs and the performance of Jeffrey Combs, which he described as superior to Combs&#x27;s already great work in the original.

&quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; was nominated for two awards by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films in 1991. It was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Jeffrey Combs was nominated for Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Sequel==
&quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; was followed by &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; in 2003.

<text>The IAI Harpy is a loitering munition missile produced by Israel Aerospace Industries. The Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD) role. It carries a high explosive warhead. The Harpy has been sold to several foreign nations, including South Korea, India and China.

==Design and development==
In the late 1980s, Kentron sold the designs for its ARD-10 loitering drone to IAI. IAI then used those designs to develop the Harpy which was first tested in 1989.

In 2004, the Harpy became the focus of the effort by the United States to restrict arms transfers and the sales of advanced military technology to China. Sold to China in 1994 for around US$55 million, the loitering munitions were returned to Israel in 2004 under contract to be upgraded. The United States, fearing that the Harpy would pose a threat to Taiwanese and American forces in the case of a war with China, demanded that Israel seize the loitering munitions and nullify the contract. According to Israel, the Harpy is an indigenously designed loitering munition, and does not contain any US-produced sub-systems. In 2005, the loitering munitions were returned to China without being upgraded. This incident chilled relations between the United States and Israel, with Israel being suspended from its status as Security Cooperative Participant in the Joint Strike Fighter program. However, on 6 November 2005, Israel stated that it has been re-admitted into the program.

<doc id="1336114" wikidata="Q2145321" url="?curid=1336114" title="Republic XF-12 Rainbow">
<text>The Republic XF-12 Rainbow was an American four-engine, all-metal prototype reconnaissance aircraft designed by the Republic Aviation Company in the late 1940s. Like most large aircraft of the era, it used radial engines, specifically the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major. The XF-12 was referred to as &quot;flying on all fours&quot; meaning: four engines, cruise, range, at . The aircraft was designed to maximize aerodynamic efficiency. Although innovative, the jet engine and the end of World War 2 made it obsolete, and it did not enter production. A proposed airliner variant, the RC-2, was deemed uneconomical and cancelled before being built.

==Development==
The original proposal from the United States Army Air Corps Air Technical Service Command in late 1943 was for a reconnaissance aircraft with a range of and a ceiling of . Its primary objective was high-speed overflights of the Japanese homeland and key enemy installations. During World War II, due to the range requirements of operating in the Pacific, existing fighters and bombers were being used but were poorly suited to the USAAF&#x27;s needs. The requirement existed for dedicated photo-reconnaissance aircraft with speed, range, and altitude capabilities beyond what was then available.

In August 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s son, Colonel Elliot Roosevelt, commander of a Lockheed F-5 (a modified P-38 Lightning) &quot;recon&quot; unit, recommended the acquisition of a dedicated high-performance photo reconnaissance aircraft to provide pre- and post-strike target analysis intelligence as well as photo interpretation to better allow commanders to make decisions for bombing raids. Republic Aviation submitted the XF-12 and it was competing against the Hughes XF-11. Both were powered by the new P&amp;W R-4360. The XF-12&#x27;s first flight was made on 4 February 1946 and during flight testing, it reached an altitude of at , and demonstrated a range of , exceeding design criteria. The XF-12 could photograph in both daylight and night and under conditions of reduced visibility at high altitudes over long ranges and with great speed. This &quot;flying photo lab&quot; was capable of mapping broad stretches of the globe.

Only two prototypes were built each of the XF-11 and the XF-12 were ordered into service by the U.S. Army Air Forces, as the requirement evaporated after World War II ended, while the cheaper off-the-shelf Boeing B-29 Superfortress and Boeing B-50 Superfortress could temporarily fill the role until the jet-powered Boeing RB-47 Stratojet entered service. The XF-12 was the fastest aircraft of its day to use four reciprocating engines, and the only one to exceed in level flight

==Design==

Minimizing drag was a primary consideration throughout the design of the XF-12. Many features came from Republic&#x27;s experience with fighter aircraft. Unusually, no compromises to the aerodynamics were made in the shape of its fuselage. Aviation Week was quoted as saying &quot;the sharp nose and cylindrical cigar shape of the XF-12 fulfills a designer&#x27;s dream of a no compromise design with aerodynamic considerations.&quot;

For its reconnaissance role, the XF-12 had three photographic compartments aft of the wing. One vertical, one split vertical, and one trimetrogon each using a Fairchild K-17 camera. For night reconnaissance, the XF-12 had a belly hold which accommodated 18 high-intensity photo-flash bombs to be ejected over the target. All bays were equipped with electrically operated, inward retracting doors designed for minimum drag and camera lenses were electrically heated to prevent frost build-up. The XF-12 also carried complete darkroom facilities to permit developing and printing the film while still airborne augmented by adjustable storage racks to handle any size of film container and additional photo equipment. This allowed immediate access to the intelligence after landing without the usual processing delay.

Its wing had a straight taper with a high aspect ratio for maximum efficiency and squared tips. The engines used a sliding cowl to facilitate engine cooling instead of cowling flaps, which caused too much drag. There was also a two-stage impeller fan directly behind the propeller hub. These refinements allowed the engines to be tightly cowled for aerodynamic efficiency, while still keeping the engines adequately cooled. When the sliding cowl ring was closed during flight, the cooling air was ducted through the nacelle to the rear exhaust orifice increasing thrust, rather than adding drag as is usually the case.

Air for engine intakes, oil coolers and intercoolers was drawn through the leading edge of each wing between the inboard and outboard engines. This reduced drag compared to using individual intakes for each component. In addition, because the air was taken from a high-pressure area at the front of the wing, this provided a ram air boost for increased power at high speeds, and more effective cooling of the oil and intercoolers. The intakes made up 25% of the total wingspan and were extensively wind tunnel tested. After being used, the air was ducted toward the rear of the nacelle, to provide thrust. The entire engine nacelle was nearly as long as a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Research showed that a force roughly equivalent to was generated by each engine exhaust during high speed cruise while at altitude. Each engine featured twin General Electric turbochargers at the rear of the nacelle and for brief bursts of additional power, water-methanol injection.

The XF-12 was originally intended to use contra-rotating propellers similar to those used on the XF-11, However, due to delivery delays and reliability issues, they were never installed. They would have been twinned three-bladed propellers (rotating in opposite directions). As it was, the aircraft used standard four-bladed Curtiss Electric propellers.

The only visible external difference between the first and second prototypes was the addition of cooling gills on the upper engine cowlings. The second prototype was fitted with the full reconnaissance equipment suite.

==Operational history==
The first prototype was damaged on 10 July 1947 while undergoing maximum landing weight tests when the right main gear was severed at the engine nacelle. After bouncing hard and staggering back into the air the test pilot climbed to a safe altitude where excess fuel was burnt off, to lighten the aircraft and reduce the risk of fire. The pilot landed on the left main gear and the nose wheel and despite losing as much speed as possible before the other wing dropped, the aircraft suffered significant damage. The wing spar was cracked, and engines and props needed to be replaced but it was repaired by Republic, and returned to service. When the U.S. Army Air Forces became the U.S. Air Force the XF-12 was later re-designated XR-12.

Operation Birds Eye was conceived to demonstrate the XF-12&#x27;s capabilities. On 1 September 1948, the second prototype departed the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center at Muroc, California, and climbed west to its cruising altitude over the Pacific before heading east. It then photographed its entire flight path across the United States on 390 individual photos each covering , which were jointed to form a continuous print.

They landed at Mitchel Field on Long Island, New York after six hours and 55 minutes at an average speed of . A photo was taken approximately every 66 seconds. The flight was featured in the 29 November 1948 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine and the filmstrip exhibited at the 1948 U.S. Air Force Association Convention in New York. The XF-12 program had already been canceled when this flight was made.

On 7 November 1948, the second prototype crashed while returning to Eglin Air Force Base from a photographic suitability test flight after the number 2 (port inner) engine exploded, causing violent buffeting. Five of the seven crew escaped safely while two crew members were killed.
The first prototype continued flight testing after being returned to service in 1948 but with no orders forthcoming and with the second prototype lost, flight testing was wound down and the remaining prototype was retired in June 1952, having flown just 117 hours from 1949 to 1952. It was later expended as a target at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.

==RC-2==
Republic proposed an airliner version, the RC-2, which would be lengthened to with a fuselage plug ahead of the wing, and the Plexiglas nose replaced with a conventional nose. Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-59s with only one General Electric turbosupercharger each would replace the R-4360-31s, providing more power at lower altitudes, and fuel capacity would be increased. The airliner would carry a crew of seven, and the lavishly appointed cabin for 46 passengers would feature pressurization to sea level with air conditioning, an electric galley providing hot meals, and an inflight lounge. The RC-2 would cruise above bad weather at at .

American Airlines and Pan Am made tentative orders, but without military F-12 orders to subsidize development and tooling costs, the RC-2&#x27;s purchase price was higher than they would accept. The RC-2 also would have had higher operating costs per passenger than more capacious airliners with similar fuel consumption such as the Lockheed Constellation and the Douglas DC-6, and the end of the war created a glut of surplus military transports such as the Douglas C-54 Skymaster which could be readily converted into airliners for a fraction of the cost of new aircraft. Thus, the RC-2 program was cancelled before any were built.

<doc id="1336117" wikidata="Q853274" url="?curid=1336117" title="Beyond Re-Animator">
<text>Beyond Re-Animator is a 2003 Spanish-American horror film directed by Brian Yuzna and starring Jeffrey Combs, Jason Barry, Elsa Pataky, Simón Andreu and Santiago Segura. It is the third and final installment in the &quot;Re-Animator&quot; film series.

An international co-production of Spain and the United States, &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel, though it was produced independently and acquired by the channel only as a distributor; this showing was cut to a TV-PG rating. The film received a limited theatrical run in the U.S. and was assigned an R rating, and a slightly longer unrated cut was released on home media in some countries.

==Plot==
For the past 13 years, Dr. Herbert West has been serving a prison sentence due to a murder at the hands of one of his zombies.

With what scant supplies he has on hand in the prison medical center, Dr. West has been capable of performing only extremely basic experiments on rats. However, his lack of supplies does not prevent him from uncovering a key element in his re-animation process. Dr. West has discovered &quot;NPE&quot; (Nano-Plasmic Energy), an energy that can be extracted from the brain of a living organism through an electrocution-like process, to be stored in a capsule resembling a small light bulb. The capsule can then be connected to a corpse and used in conjunction with West&#x27;s previously developed reagent to restore the former dead to a lifelike state. The NPE prevents the degeneration seen in previous instances, where the reanimated are nothing more than mindless zombies. Used together with the re-agent, reanimated corpses regain their skills, memories, and motor functions and nearly fully resemble normal humans.

When a young doctor named Howard Phillips comes to work at the prison, West is assigned to assist the new doctor. Due to Phillips&#x27; interest in Dr. West&#x27;s research, West is able to attain the supplies and tools needed to bring his experiments to the next level. It is revealed that Phillips is the younger brother of the teenage girl who was killed by West&#x27;s zombie (he is shown watching West being taken away by the cops) and came to the prison for the explicit purpose of working with him. Despite his interest, Phillips still maintains an ethical reluctance to allow West&#x27;s research to full completion. In the meantime, journalist Laura Olney, covering a story for her newspaper at the prison, meets and begins an affair with Dr. Phillips, and they fall in love. This new romance only temporarily postpones West&#x27;s experiment, however. After the warden of the prison, also infatuated with Laura, attempts to seduce Laura himself, she resists and he angrily kills her.

Crushed by Laura&#x27;s death, Dr. Phillips succumbs to Dr. West&#x27;s wishes and his experiments are allowed to literally take on new life. West &amp; Phillips revive Laura with the NPE, although it is quickly seen that the dangerous side effects of West&#x27;s past work are still present with the NPE. Eventually, the warden of the prison uncovers West&#x27;s experiments and moves to put an end to them, but he is killed by West, and subsequently re-animated. West uses the NPE from a prisoner&#x27;s pet rat, causing some unexpected side effects in the warden&#x27;s behavior. It quickly manifests itself as the prison descends into utter chaos as a riot breaks out, with vials of the reagent circulating through the population. Soon, it is unclear who is dead, who is alive, and who has been exposed to the agent.

When the chaos finally settles from the bloody prison riot, West escapes captivity before the guards appear by stealing Phillips&#x27; I.D. when he comes across Phillips weeping over Laura&#x27;s decapitated body. As police and authorities take control of the prison, Phillips is dragged away as he and Laura&#x27;s head start laughing. Herbert West is shown putting on his glasses outside the prison and disappears into the night to continue his research.

==Production==
Brian Yuzna following the release of &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; had wanted to continue the franchise and upon being approached 10 years later by Spanish company Filmax in setting up their horror film production arm Fantastic Factory the opportunity presented itself for a third &quot;Re-Animator&quot; to be produced.
As Yuzna had exhausted the source material of the original H. P. Lovecraft short story &quot;Herbert West–Reanimator&quot;, he approached writer John Penney, with whom he had collaborated on &quot;Return of the Living Dead 3&quot;, for potential ideas for continuation. While Penney&#x27;s treatment ultimately wasn&#x27;t used, the concept of Herbert West now serving a prison sentence became the basis for what would become &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot;. The initial draft of the film would&#x27;ve brought back Bruce Abbott&#x27;s Dan Cain who turned state&#x27;s evidence against West and is now a successful, albeit vice ridden, transplant surgeon who is using what remains of West&#x27;s re-animation serum in his surgical procedures and is forced by a politically ambitious district attorney to use the re-animaion serum on a serial killer&#x27;s recently deceased victim in order to catch them. Due to the amount of time that had passed between films as well as the impossibility of Spain convincingly doubling for the United States, Yuzna decided to scale back the film to be more of a confined prison movie as well as Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West returning to the role, Jason Barry was brought in to play a more youthful foil for West.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 55% based on 11 critics, with an average rating of 5.30/10 Allmovie gave the film a mixed review, calling it &quot;almost a remake of the original&quot;. Jonathan Holland of &quot;Variety&quot; writes that the film is &quot;sometimes shocking but rarely scary&quot; and &quot;calculated to appeal only to hardcore gore hounds.&quot; In a mixed review, Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict called it &quot;somewhat of a letdown&quot; but &quot;worth at least one viewing&quot;. Writing for Bloody Disgusting, Brad Miska rates the film 2.5/5 stars and called it &quot;a fun movie, but nothing special&quot;.

In their book &quot;Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft&quot;, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: &quot;If your idea of Lovecraftian fun is Combs&#x27; acidic one-liners, and digitally enhanced gore effects that weren&#x27;t available for the other two films, then by all means have a look. But if you&#x27;re comparing this film to the still classic &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, well... This third try is only a shadow of the gonzo wit of the original and not nearly as entertaining.&quot;

&quot;Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For&quot; author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that &quot;&quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; is better than its immediate predecessor&quot; and that &quot;Combs slips back into the white shirt and black tie, wielding the hypo of green goo like he never put it down, but his performance is nicely tempered by the passage of time, giving us a West that lacks some of his youthful confidence but none of his single-minded desire to pursue &#x27;The Work.&#x27;&quot; Bruce G. Hallenbeck, in his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot;, again described Brian Yuzna&#x27;s direction as &quot;competent but uninspired&quot;, but said the film&#x27;s biggest problem is that most of the cast are Spanish actors whose voices were obviously dubbed over to conceal their accents, resulting in a lack of both tension and comedy. He commented that Jeffrey Combs is still outstanding in the role of Herbert West, but his performance is muted due to a complete lack of strong co-stars to play off of.

==Home media==
&quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; was given a straight-to-video release on December 23, 2003.

In 2011 Arrow Video released a Special Edition DVD of the film, with the following special features:
* Audio commentary with director Brian Yuzna
* &#x27;All in the Head&#x27; Brian Yuzna on the Re-Animator Chronicles (50 mins)
* Original trailer
* Reversible cover sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Tom Hodge &#x27;The Dude Designs&#x27;
* Double-sided fold-out poster featuring new artwork
* Collector&#x27;s booklet featuring &#x27;World of Lovecraft&#x27; and an interview with star Jeffrey Combs by author and critic Calum Waddell, as well as an extract from H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s original story ‘Herbert West – Reanimator’

==Unmade follow-ups==
After the conclusion of &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot;, Brian Yuzna wanted to produce a sequel trilogy to the series. The first of which would&#x27;ve been titled &quot;House of Re-Animator&quot; and would have featured William H. Macy as a George W. Bush inspired President of the United States who dies in office with Herbert West enlisted by the office to bring him back to life. The film would have seen Stuart Gordon as director and Dennis Paoli as writer, and the return of Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West and Bruce Abbott as Dan Cain.

The second film would&#x27;ve been titled &quot;Island of Re-Animator&quot; and seen Dr. West having set up a laboratory on a secluded island to continue his research. Richard Raaphorst, a concept artist who had worked on other Fantastic Factory productions, was tasked by Yuzna with creating some artwork for the film but Yuzna ultimately felt none of it worked in the world of &quot;Re-Animator&quot;. Some of Raaphorst&#x27;s artwork were speculated to have been reused for his own directorial effort, &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Army&quot;.

The final film in the trilogy would&#x27;ve been titled &quot;Re-Animator Begins&quot; and would&#x27;ve featured an amnesiac Hebert West rescued from an asylum by a young female doctor who takes him to Zürich where it&#x27;s revealed she&#x27;s the granddaughter of Dr. Hans Gruber from the first film who is still living in his re-animated state. The film would&#x27;ve seen Hebert West passing the torch of &quot;Re-Animator&quot; to Gruber&#x27;s granddaughter.

The sequel trilogy ultimately never happened due to inability to secure financing, and while an attempt to sell &quot;House of Re-Animator&quot; as a standalone movie were met with some interest the sequel was deemed too expensive and the Great Recession effectively killed the project.

Further attempts were made by Yuzna and John Penney in pitching a reboot of &quot;Re-Animator&quot; and while they were met with interest from companies such as Warner Bros., the two abandoned this route when the studios showed interest primarily in the name recognition and intended to play &quot;Re-Animator&quot; as a dark and serious horror film in contrast to the more darkly comedic nature of the prior films.

<text>The EMD F2 was a freight-hauling diesel locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between July 1946 and November 1946. It succeeded the FT model in GM-EMD&#x27;s F-unit sequence, and was replaced in turn by the F3. The F2 was in many respects a transitional type between those two; it kept the rated D8 generator from the FT due to late development of the new D12 generator intended for the F3, but in a revised carbody design and internal layout that would be continued through the rest of the F-unit series. 74 cab-equipped lead A units and 30 cabless booster B units were produced.

There are no reliable recognition features for an F2. They were built with what has become known as &#x27;Type 1&#x27; side panels, with three portholes and no filter grilles, but this was carried over into early F3 production and in any case, could be changed later by the customer. Like some early F3s, they were built with small side numberboards on the nose. They, and all subsequent F-units, are readily distinguished from the FT by having two exhaust stacks instead of four, and by having no large overhang on the end of the B units, while the trucks were a little further away from the other ends. 

They also had four radiator fans at the center of the unit next to each other in line on the roof instead of two at each end. This external feature was the result of a major change in internal arrangement, the replacement of all mechanical and belt-drives for radiator fans and traction motor blowers with electric motors. Power for these accessories was produced by a new D14 three phase alternator built into the main DC generator, called a “companion alternator”. This device has been used in all later EMD road locomotives to the present.

All F2&#x27;s were scrapped, making them the only EMD F-unit model with no extant examples.

<doc id="1336164" wikidata="Q1277577" url="?curid=1336164" title="Frank Lowy">
<text>Sir Frank P. Lowy ( ; born 22 October 1930) is an Australian-Israeli businessman of Jewish Slovak-Hungarian origins and the former long-time chairman of Westfield Corporation, a global shopping centre company with billion of assets under management in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. In June 2018 Westfield Corporation was acquired by French company Unibail-Rodamco.

Lowy was the inaugural chairman of Scentre Group, the owner and manager of Westfield-branded shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand.

With an assessed net worth of billion in 2023, Lowy was ranked as the tenth richest Australian according to the &quot;Financial Review Rich List&quot;; having been the richest person in Australia during 2010. &quot;Forbes Asia&quot; magazine assessed Lowy&#x27;s net worth at billion in January 2019 and placed him fourth in its Australia&#x27;s 50 Richest people.

Lowy is the founder of the Lowy Institute, Australia&#x27;s leading foreign affairs think tank, which has alternatively been described as &quot;neoliberal&quot;, &quot;centre-right&quot; leaning or &quot;reactionary&quot;. Lowy is also chairman of the Institute for National Security Studies, an independent think tank that studies key issues relating to Israel&#x27;s national security and Middle East affairs.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lowy was born in Czechoslovakia (in what is now Slovakia), and was forced to live in a ghetto in Hungary during World War II. He made his way to France in 1946, where he boarded the ship &quot;Yagur&quot;, heading for Mandatory Palestine. However, he was caught on route by the British authorities and interned in a detention camp in Cyprus. Lowy joined the Haganah, and then the Golani Brigade, and fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War in the Galilee and Gaza.

===Career===
In 1952, Lowy left Israel and joined his family, who had left Europe for Australia and started a business delivering small goods. In 1953, he met fellow immigrant John Saunders. The pair became business partners, eventually creating Westfield Development Corporation through the development of a shopping centre at Blacktown in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs. Over the next 30 years, Lowy and Saunders developed shopping centres across Australia and the United States (from 1977); and listed the company on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1960 as Westfield Development Corporation. Saunders sold his interests and left the company in 1987. In the 1990s Lowy took the company to New Zealand, then the United Kingdom in the 2000s.

Lowy was appointed a Director of the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1995, was reappointed in 2000 and 2003, and concluded his term in 2005. In 2008 Lowy and related interests were mentioned in documents stolen from the LGT Bank of Liechtenstein by a former employee. A subsequent US Senate probe and an Australian Taxation Office audit investigated Lowy and his sons, David and Steven, on their involvement with financial institutions in tax havens located in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Lowy maintained he had not done anything wrong, the matter was settled with the ATO, and no action was taken.

After turning 80 in October 2010, Lowy officially stood down as executive chairman of the Westfield Group effective May 2011, taking on the role of non-executive chairman. Sons, Steven and Peter, became joint chief executives. In October 2015, Lowy stepped down as the chairman of the Scentre Group, a role that he had held for 55 years.

==Personal life==

Lowy married Shirley Rusanow in 1954, having met at a Jewish dance when he was 21. They have three sons, Peter and Steven, who managed the Westfield business, and David, who manages the family&#x27;s private investments. His wife was the founder of the Chai Foundation which is dedicated to finding and funding research into effective but less toxic forms of cancer therapy. His son Peter, is chairman of Tribe Media Corp, the parent of the &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; and served as chairman of the University of Judaism.

In an Australian television production broadcast in 2010, called &quot;Family Confidential&quot;, it was revealed that Lowy had kept a secret about his survival in Nazi occupied Hungary. 

Lowy moved to Israel at the end of 2018. Lady Lowy died in Tel Aviv in December 2020, after a long battle with dementia. In &quot;What Will Become of Us&quot;, a documentary screened at the 2019 Sydney Film Festival, Lowy spoke openly of the trauma of gradually losing his wife.

===Net worth===
Lowy has appeared on the &quot;Financial Review Rich List&quot;, formerly the &quot;BRW Rich 200&quot; list, every year since it was first published in 1983. In 2010, the &quot;BRW&quot; magazine measured Lowy&#x27;s net worth at 5.04 billion, making him Australia&#x27;s richest person at that time. In 2016 his net worth was assessed as 8.26 billion on the &quot;BRW Rich 200&quot; list; and the same net worth the following year when the list was renamed as the &quot;Financial Review Rich List.&quot;


===Football in Australia===
In the 1980&#x27;s Lowy was president of the Hakoah Social Club, which was attached to the Hakoah Sydney City East FC football team. Hakoah played in the National Soccer League between 1977 and 1986. In 1982 Lowy stood for a role in the Australian Soccer Federation board, but was defeated by a coalition headed by long term President Arthur George. In 1987 Hakoah opened up the season with a match in front of 5,187 fans. This was not enough for Lowy, who had promised to withdraw Hakoah from the competition if crowds were low. After a heated general meeting the membership voted to withdraw. Lowy withdrew from Club Hakoah and the sport in general by 1988, not to return until the final demise of the NSL and Soccer Australia in 2004 after decades of mismanagement &amp; poor decisions regarding television contracts.

With the NSL and Soccer Australia defunct, Prime Minister John Howard &amp; Sports Minister Rod Kemp commissioned the 2003 Report of the Independent Soccer Review Committee. Commonly known as the &#x27;Crawford Report&#x27;, it called for a new board headed up by Lowy. Lowy quickly placed Soccer Australia into liquidation, replacing it with a new &quot;Australia Soccer Association&quot; which was later renamed to Football Federation Australia, in order to distance itself from the previous iterations and to align with the general usage of the word football across the world. Much of the Crawford Report recommendations were ignored by Lowy in favour of his own decisions regarding the setup and future of the Federation &amp; the sport in Australia. Most importantly for his control, he ignored recommendations regarding the board composition that called for players, coaches, referees, indoor players and a specific women&#x27;s football representative. He also ignored the Player&#x27;s Association report that recommended having two teams in Sydney &amp; Melbourne.

Lowy was chairman of the Football Federation Australia (FFA) from 2003 to November 2015. Some observers credit him and John O&#x27;Neill, a former rugby union executive, with resurrecting soccer in Australia. A televised &quot;A-League&quot; is now in place, and the country has become a member of the Asian Football Confederation.

In 2007 Lowy commenced a campaign to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Australia backed with 43 million in support from the Australian Government. In 2010, amid allegations of bribery, politics, and back-scratching, FIFA awarded Qatar the right to host the World Cup.

In 2015, he fell off a stage as the A-League trophy was due to be presented. In May 2015 he underwent surgery to resolve a complication that had arisen from the fall.

Lowy completed his term-limited period in charge of the FFA, then handed over power to his son Steven Lowy unopposed. The move was controversial and viewed as nepotism and questions over Steven&#x27;s lack of experience in football governance were partly responsible for a significant power struggle at the highest levels. Intervention by FIFA eventually resulted in a new governance model, the splitting away of the A-League competition from direct control of the FFA and large changes at the boardroom level. Steven resigned from the role and Lowy also sold the last of his shares in Sydney FC at this time.

===Philanthropy===
Lowy has a reputation for giving his time and financial support to a broad range of causes. He was awarded the title of Australia&#x27;s leading philanthropist by peak body, Philanthropy Australia, with donations in 2002 of 10 million.

In April 2003 to mark the 50th anniversary of his arrival in Australia, Lowy established the Lowy Institute, an independent international policy think tank devoted to foreign affairs, and Australia&#x27;s role in the world. It was reported that a gift of A$30 million was made to establish the Institute. Together with the Packer family, in 2008 Lowy donated an undisclosed amount towards the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. In 2010, Lowy and his family donated 10 million to facilitate the construction of the UNSW Lowy Cancer Research Centre, a collaborative centre of the Children&#x27;s Cancer Institute Australia and the Faculty of Medicine at the University of New South Wales.
In 2022, he donated $18 million to Tel Aviv University. 

== March Of The Living ==
In April 2013, In April 2013, Lowy attended the &quot;March of the Living&quot;, where he shared the story of how his father perished during the Holocaust, with thousands of young students from around the world who had gathered in Auschwitz-Birkenau to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day. As a 13-year-old boy, Lowy had never known about the loss of his father, Hugo Lowy, who was beaten to death at Auschwitz for refusing to leave his Jewish prayer bag containing his Jewish prayer shawl (Talit) and phylacteries (Teffilin) behind.. As a mark of respect to Hugo Lowy and other Hungarian Jews, Lowy commissioned the restoration of a railway wagon that had transported Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, and placed the wagon on site at the former concentration camp.

Later, during the memorial ceremony, Lowy addressed the students and said: &quot;So here I am, with you all in Birkenau. I know he was also here, under this same sky. Just like almost half a million Hungarian Jews, he came to this place in a wagon and, almost immediately after arriving, disappeared as smoke into the sky. I was 13 when I lost my father, and now I am 82 – and you know, I still miss him.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2000, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his service to the community through the development of the property industry and expansion of the retail sector in Australia and internationally, and as philanthropist committed to support of wide-ranging social and cultural endeavours. In 2002, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Ehud Barak in Dublin, Ireland. The establishment of the Lowy Institute led him to being awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship in 2005 by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. On 2 October 2007 Lowy received the Henni Friedlander Award for the Common Good at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, United States. In 2008 Lowy was honoured by Australia Post for his contribution to philanthropy as one of the nation&#x27;s five leading, living philanthropists with a commemorative postage stamp that was released on the eve of Australia Day as part of the Australian Legends series.

He was knighted in the 2017 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours (UK) for services to business and philanthropy.

<text>Michael Aaron Einziger (born June 21, 1976) is an American musician, songwriter and producer. He is best known for being co-founder and guitarist of the rock band Incubus, and has also co-written, produced and collaborated with a wide array of artists including Pharrell Williams, Hans Zimmer, Skrillex, Tyler the Creator, Avicii, Damian Marley, Jason Schwartzman (Coconut Records) and Steve Martin among many others. Incubus has sold over 23 Million albums worldwide, and in 2013, Einziger co-wrote the hit song &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;, alongside Avicii and Aloe Blacc. As an entrepreneur, Einziger is the co-founder and co-chairman of the wireless technology platform MIXhalo, and also the co-founder and CEO of the biotechnology startup Versicolor Technologies. Einziger received his education at Harvard University.

== Career ==

=== Incubus ===

Einziger co-founded Incubus with Calabasas High School classmates Brandon Boyd, Jose Pasillas II, and Alex Katunich in 1991. Incubus has sold over 23 million albums worldwide and has been nominated for two Grammys, MTV music video awards, American Music Awards, MTV U Woodie Award, and the Billboard Awards. Incubus has performed sold-out concerts at The Hollywood Bowl, The Great Western Forum, Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, Wembley Arena in London, and Araneta Coliseum in Manila, Philippines.

=== Solo work and current projects ===
Outside of his work with Incubus, Einziger founded his own project Time Lapse Consortium in 2003. The group featured Incubus musicians Jose Pasillas II and Ben Kenney (who was not a member of Incubus at the time), Neal Evans of the band Soulive, and long-time collaborator Suzie Katayama contributing string arrangements. The band had their debut show at The Roxy in LA, and would go on to play Jimmy Kimmel and the Knitting Factory in New York City.

Einziger&#x27;s career as a film score composer began in the early 2000s, first with the short film &quot;Miss Gentilbelle&quot;, and then the independent comedy film &quot;Sol Goode&quot;, which also featured Jared Leto of the band Thirty Seconds to Mars. He has sporadically continued to compose background music for films.

In 2003 Einziger contributed to Ziggy Marley&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Dragonfly&quot; alongside fellow Incubus member Chris Kilmore as well as Flea and John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Einziger also expanded into the realm of video games when he and his bandmates worked on the soundtrack of the popular game Halo 2, writing a 26-minute song that also featured Flea on trumpet. In 2006 Einziger produced the debut album &quot;Red Rover&quot; by Agent Sparks; a collaboration with younger brothers Benjamin Einziger and Paul Fried.

In 2007, Einziger produced &quot;Nighttiming&quot;, the debut album of long-time friend and former Phantom Planet drummer and actor Jason Schwartzman&#x27;s Coconut Records project. The album featured appearances by Kirsten Dunst, Zooey Deschanel, and Robert Schwartzman, and was recorded at Einziger&#x27;s own home studio in Malibu, CA (Casa Chica).

==== End.&gt;vacuum ====
Einziger began crafting an orchestral composition &quot;End.&gt;vacuum&quot; following surgery in March 2007 for carpal tunnel syndrome, a repetitive-strain injury to his left wrist. The condition forced him to take a hiatus from the band and his instrument.

The piece consisted of nine musical movements (approximately 40 minutes total) and was performed by a chamber orchestra led by renowned Los Angeles conductor and Einziger&#x27;s longtime collaborator Suzie Katayama. Inspiration has been attributed to such iconoclastic modern and avant-garde composers as Igor Stravinsky, George Antheil, George Crumb, Samuel Barber, Krzysztof Penderecki and Frank Zappa.

According to Einziger, &quot;End.&gt;vacuum&quot; makes reference to his perception of the outer edge of human understanding, &quot;the finite place where rational scientific knowledge stops and pure speculation ensues…The event horizon between what we know and what we don&#x27;t know is what keeps me awake at night, but also gets me out of bed every day.&quot;

&quot;Einziger&#x27;s work plays with time.&quot; Los Angeles Times&#x27; Steve Hochman proclaimed, &quot;Pulsating tribal/mechanical rhythms melt into sustained, almost static stretches before the rhythm reemerges. The early-&#x27;80s large ensemble work of John Adams comes to mind, but the character of the piece is Einziger&#x27;s own.&quot;

End.&gt;vacuum was Einziger&#x27;s first original orchestral composition. It debuted at UCLA&#x27;s famed Royce Hall on August 23, 2008.

==== Harvard and studies ====
Einziger has studied the history and philosophy of physics with physicist/historian, Dr. Peter Galison, of Harvard University.

He has a profound interest in the physical sciences. In 2008 he contributed to an article on the topic of human evolution with evolutionary biology figure and Brown University professor Dr. Kenneth Miller.

On June 17, 2008, Einziger took a personal tour of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland with British physicist Dr. Brian Cox. During that visit, Einziger invited Dr. Cox to appear as a speaker at his concert for &quot;End.&gt;vacuum&quot; later that Fall.

==== Other recent works ====

In 2009, Einziger orchestrated and recorded the additional strings for the Thirty Seconds to Mars third album &quot;This Is War&quot;.

In 2012 Einziger began working with progressive house artist Avicii on the EDM producer&#x27;s song &quot;Wake Me Up!&quot; for his debut studio album &quot;True&quot;. Einziger helped premiere the song live at Ultra 15 along with bandmates Jose Pasillas, Ben Kenney and country music legend Mac Davis. As of July 2013, the song reached No. 1 on the charts in 39 countries.

Einziger also worked on music for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; with Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr and David A. Stewart.

== Musical influences ==
Mike has cited his early guitar influences as Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, John Frusciante, Steve Vai, Paul Fried and Frank Zappa. He claims &quot;infatuation&quot; with Björk&#x27;s voice. Mike was also heavily influenced by the music of Black Sabbath and Metallica. Mike said that some of the music he was most proud of was the music he had worked on with Avicii.

== Personal life ==
Einziger was born in Los Angeles. He is of Jewish descent.

Beginning in 2008, Mike was enrolled as a special student studying music theory at Harvard University.

In August 2017, Mike welcomed his first children, twin girls, with wife Ann-Marie Calhoun.

== Equipment ==
Early on, Einziger played Ibanez guitars, and sometime around the making of &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; (1997) he switched to Paul Reed Smith (PRS) (Custom 24&#x27;s). On the albums &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Make Yourself&quot; he used a Mesa Boogie Tremoverb. While recording songs on &quot;Make Yourself&quot; (1999), for example the track &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, Einziger used PRS McCarty Archtop guitars. On the &quot;Morning View&quot; (2001) album, he only used his PRS McCarty Archtops. During the &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; tour, he started playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars. This guitar is played most prominently on the &quot;Alive at Red Rocks&quot; DVD. On the Light Grenades tour, Einziger was seen using a Gibson SG Junior with P-90&#x27;s modified with an extra neck pickup and a pickup selector switch. In 2012, he switched to Music Man Albert Lee signature guitars and began running lighter strings (down to 9s after running 13s for many years) because of his need to find a more &quot;comfortable&quot; guitar for touring. Einziger has stated this was necessary since developing and having surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. He currently uses Fender Telecaster guitars.

Einziger is a multi-instrumentalist and, in addition to guitar, has played piano, Mellotron, pipa, analog synthesizers, Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, and many other instruments on his recordings with Incubus as well as his other projects. He has also played a Jerry Jones Guitars Master Sitar on &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; from &quot;Make Yourself&quot; (for live performances he plays the sitar part with his guitar), and a pipa on &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;. Einziger also plays electric piano on songs like &quot;Here In My Room&quot;, and has played piano on live versions of &quot;Drive&quot;.

He commonly uses Mesa/Boogie Trem-O-Verb 2/12 Combos and Marshall Plexi amplifiers. He uses Electro-Harmonix Micro POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator) for the solo section on &quot;Promises, Promises.&quot; On the title track, &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot; Einziger plays a Mellotron mandolin. He has a 1930s Gibson with a smaller body and used an older Martin acoustic when recording &quot;Defiance&quot;. In the video for &quot;Adolescents&quot;, he is seen with a custom PRS guitar which was sold at a charity auction for $15,000 and was borrowed from the buyer for the video shoot.

He stopped using PRS guitars after some issues arose with an employee of Paul Reed Smith.

A detailed gear diagram of Einziger&#x27;s 2000 Incubus guitar rig is well-documented.

<text>Andrey Karlov Lukanov ( ; 26 September 1938 – 2 October 1996) was a Bulgarian politician. Between February and November 1990, Lukanov was the final Prime Minister of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lukanov was born in Moscow, USSR, in the family of Karlo Lukanov, (1897–1982), a Bulgarian communist émigré. Lukanov&#x27;s family moved back to Bulgaria after the communist takeover of 1944 when Lukanov was only 6 years old. His father became an important figure in the party and served as foreign minister of Bulgaria from 1956 to 1961.

===Political career===
Andrey became a member of the party in 1963 and began a career in the foreign service. He helped represent Bulgaria in the United Nations and Comecon. He rose through the ranks of the foreign service to become minister of foreign economic affairs in 1987, resigning in 1989. Lukanov became a leading member of the reformist wing of the BCP, and took part in the overthrow of longtime leader Todor Zhivkov. He became prime minister on 3 February 1990. This office he held until 7 December 1990. Midway through his tenure, the Communist Party rebranded itself as the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

Lukanov oversaw the first democratic election which had taken place in Bulgaria since 1931. This election took place in June; the BSP remained the largest party in the national legislature, and Lukanov himself continued in government.

Seeking a stable majority, Lukanov offered to form a coalition with the opposition, but his offers were rebuffed. The opposition argued that the former Communist Party must shoulder responsibility for past political crimes and the rapidly deteriorating economy. Lukanov&#x27;s months in office were marked by corruption, huge consumer goods deficit, and civil unrest. Finally in December, after large demonstrations and a general strike, Lukanov resigned, allowing a technocratic government to be formed by Dimitar Popov.

Lukanov was charged with embezzlement in 1992 and arrested, but charges were soon dropped. During his time in the foreign service, Lukanov had gained connections with western businessmen such as Robert Maxwell and engaged in controversial business dealings.

==Death==
Lukanov was assassinated on 2 October 1996 оutside the Sofia apartment where he lived. He was shot in the head and chest by a lone gunman who fled and was never captured.

===Trial===
A building contractor named Angel Vassilev, who had been close to the incumbent BSP government led by Zhan Videnov, was arrested and charged (alongside various others) with having organized Lukanov&#x27;s murder. After a long trial and an initial guilty verdict, the Bulgarian Court of Appeal declared Vassilev and the other defendants to be innocent.

Public rumors to the effect that Lukanov would be slain had been in existence for months before the killing was carried out. To this day, the true perpetrators of the assassination remain unknown.

<doc id="1336180" wikidata="Q3391365" url="?curid=1336180" title="Orsec-Novi plan">
<text>The Orsec-Novi plan (, ), or short Novi plan (, ), is a French emergency plan used for a mass casualty incident (mascal), i.e. if an emergency has a significant number of casualties in a limited area. Its aim is to organize the rescue resources to cope with the concentrated casualties. It was formerly called red plan (, ); &quot;Orsec&quot; stands for &quot;rescue management&quot; (organisation dessecours&quot;), and &quot;novi&quot; for &quot;multiple casualties&quot; (nombreuses victimes&quot;).

It is different from the French white plan (), which is designed to face a sudden and unpredicted rise of the activity of a hospital. Since 2007, it is part from the Orsec plan (), which is generally designed to face insufficient emergency resources. In a Novi plan, the emergency resources are sufficient. The difficulty is coordinating them.

The white plan is often launched along with the Novi plan in order to face the massive arrival of casualties evacuated by the Novi plan.

The Novi plan is based on four concepts:
* The resources should be rationally organized: The resources should not hamper each other, or deplete resources needed by another emergency. This implies coordination of the different forces (firefighters, samu/emergency medical service, police), and assignment of roles (hierarchical sorting);
* There should be two chains of rescue, one focused on managing the site, the other focused on caring for the casualties;
* A field hospital (or advanced medical post) should be installed next to the casualties, to perform triage and stabilisation before the evacuation;
* There should be two commands, one on-site that deals with the management of the rescue operations, the other in a remote site (usually the préfecture) that deals with the reinforcement, the logistics...

==History==
The &quot;plan rouge&quot; was created in 1978 by the fire brigade of Paris &quot;(Brigade des sapeurs-pompiers de Paris, BSPP)&quot;, after explosions during an urban fire (rue Raynouard, Paris 16e), that resulted in 13 dead and a great number of casualties. The name &quot;red plan&quot; refers to the traditional color of the French firefighters, and to the color of danger (blood/fire).

It was then extended to the whole French territory by 28 October 1986 the &quot;circulaire&quot; (ministerial instruction) #86-318 (ministry of Interior/French Home Office). The red plan is defined by each département and thus can slightly vary from a dépertement to the other, but all the red plans are very similar.

Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the French authorities considere the possibility of several simultaneous terrorist acts and create the &quot;plan rouge alpha&quot; (alpha red plan). It is implemented for the first time for the November 2015 Paris attacks.

Since 2007, the &quot;plan rouge&quot; is a specific case of the &quot;plan Orsec&quot;.

==Activation==
The Novi plan is started in case of a disaster with limited consequences (&quot;accident catastrophique à effet limité&quot;, acel), when there are – or when there might be – numerous casualties. This plan is started by the préfet of the département (or, in case of Paris and its suburbs, by the préfet de police of Paris).

These situations are various:
* fire of great intensity with immediate risks for the population
* building collapse
* road accident, train accident, or airplane accident
* criminal act (collective aggression by firearm, explosives, hostage-taking, terrorist attack...) 
* industrial injury
* natural disaster

The prerequisite for a &quot;Novi plan&quot; is a great number of casualties. This estimation can vary from département to département. In Paris, the following rules apply:
:the situation involves a field hospital, and at least 15 persons must be evacuated to a hospital.
:The notion of &quot;number of casualties&quot; is different depending on the situation, and is evaluated from the initial assessment (the Novi plan must be started quickly, &quot;i.e.&quot; before all the casualties are counted):
:* for a fire, the number of casualties in the initial assessment is multiplied by 2: &quot;i.e.&quot; when the rescuers arrive, and count 6 to 8 casualties, there are usually about 15 casualties by the end of the operation;.
:* for a terrorist bombing, the multiplication factor is 3, sometimes 4 or 5;
:* for the other accidents, amongst which the public transport accident, the factor is 3 to 4.
:In some specific situations, the risks (risk of explosion, of intoxication etc.), or the organizational constraints can lead to a Novi plan although there are only few casualties.

==General concept==
In case of a Novi plan, it is necessary to simultaneously:
* fight the initial disaster and its direct and indirect consequences;
* extract the casualties from the hostile environment;
* care for the casualties.

Due to the complexity of these three missions, two command chains are formed, under the authority of the &quot;commander of the rescue operations&quot; (COS: &quot;commandant des opérations de secours&quot;) : the fire-and-rescue chain, and the medical chain:
* the fire-and-rescue chain has the charge to fight the initial disaster; the rescuers are entirely devoted to this task, and participate to the search and rescue, locating the casualties, extraction/extrication of the casualties and possibly perform first aid onsite;
* the medical chain has three functions:
** the first aid onsite, casualty lifting (&quot;scoop&quot;) and movement from the disaster location to the field hospital (called &quot;advanced medical post&quot;, or PMA: &quot;poste médical avancé&quot;);
** triage and stabilising the casualties for the evacuation;
** the evacuation of the casualties to adapted care structures (hospitals).

==Distribution of the responsibilities==

The &quot;préfet&quot; of the &quot;département&quot; (or the &quot;préfet de police&quot; for Paris and its suburbs) is the director of rescue operations (DOS: &quot;directeur des opérations de secours&quot;). He starts the Novi plan; usually, the Novi plan is started by the firefighter or medical dispatch and then officialized by the &quot;préfet&quot;.

The chief officer of the local fire and rescue department (SDIS: &quot;service départemental d&#x27;incendie et de secours&quot;) is the &quot;commander of the rescue operations&quot; (COS: &quot;commandant des opérations de secours&quot;). He is assisted by the &quot;director of fire and rescue&quot; (DSIS: &quot;directeur des secours incendie et sauvetage&quot;), and by the &quot;director of medical rescue&quot; (DSM: &quot;directeur des secours médicaux&quot;). The DSM is usually the chief-physician of the firefighters or the director of samu (French EMS).

The main resources are the firefighters and Samu, but other organisations can contribute, such as the first aid associations (&quot;e.g.&quot; French Red Cross, volunteers of the civil protection/FNPC), who can contribute to the non-medical evacuations or deal with the relative emergencies, light wounded people and logistic for psychological aid (CUMP: &quot;cellule d&#x27;urgence médico-psychologique&quot;).

==The operational command==
The commander of rescue operation (COS) coordinates the rescue resources on site (public, private or associations).
He must be easily spotted and has thus a yellow chasuble-like jacket on his clothes, with the inscription &quot;Commandant les Opérations de Secours&quot;. He has an operational headquarters (PCO: &quot;poste de commandement opérationnel&quot;) near the site of the disaster. The OHQ has communications with all the resources and administrations, including the police.

===The director of fire and rescue (DSI)===
The director of fire and rescue (DSI) is a firefighter officer. He manages:
* the fighting against the initial disaster;
* the search-and-rescue operations;
* in the beginning, the scoop operations, before the medical chain is fully operational (increasing the resources)

He has a yellow chasuble-like jacket with the inscription &quot;Directeur des Secours Incendie et Sauvetage&quot;.

===The director of medical rescue (DSM)===
The director of medical rescue (DSM) manages the medical chain described below.

He has a yellow chasuble-like jacket with the inscription &quot;Directeur des Secours Médicaux&quot;.

==The medical chain==

The medical chain is organized in three parts. The personal attributed to each part are identified by a colour armband: red-white-blue. These are the colours of the French flag, and are also the symbol of:
* red: danger zone;
* white: medical zone;
* blue: secured zone (away from the disaster site).

===The scoop===
The scoop follows of the extraction/extrication operations. It the responsibility of a firefighter officer. The casualties are transported by a stretcher chain (noria) to the advanced medical post (field hospital).

This officer has a red chasuble-like jacket with the inscription &quot;&quot;, and the personal have a red armband.

This part is also called &quot;scoop noria&quot; () or &quot;small noria&quot;.

===The advanced medical post (AMP)===
The casualties are gathered at the advanced medical post (AMP, ), managed by a physician chosen by the director of medical rescue (DSM).
He has to manage:
* the care to the casualties;
* the triage;
* to search for a destination (hospital) adapted to the different affections (medical regulation).

He commands:
* a firefighter officer (&quot;&quot;) chosen by the commander of rescue operations (COS): he deals with the organization and logistics of the PMA
* first responders, paramedical (nurses, ambulance men) and medical staff
* a secretaryship made of firefighters, who deal with:
** the establishment of the list of casualties;
** filling the identification forms (FMA: &quot;fiches médicales de l&#x27;avant&quot;);
** transmitting the list of casualties to the operational headquarters (PCO).

In urban environments, the advanced medical post (PMA) is often placed in a public location (bar, restaurant, hall of sports...). In wilderness or on a road away from any building, it is an inflatable structure.

The advanced medical post (PMA) is organized in three zones corresponding to the triage:
* Absolute emergency zone (): prehospital resuscitation unit for very serious cases: extreme emergencies () and grave injuries (U1);
* Relative emergency zone (): for the seriously (U2) and lightly injured (U3)
* Mortuary zone () for the deceased casualties. This zone is under the responsibility of the judicial police.

Two additional zones can be created, besides the advanced medical (PMA) post but under the responsibility of the director of medical rescue (DSM):
* a gathering zone for non-injured people, managed by volunteer (non-professional, association) first aiders
* a zone for psychological support under the responsibility of physicians and psychiatrists, the MPEU (medical and psychological emergency unit, ).

The chief physician of the advanced medical post has a white chasuble-like jacket with the inscription &quot;&quot;&quot;; the firefighter officer has a white chasuble-like jacket with the inscription &quot;PMA&quot;. The other staff members have a white armband.

===The evacuation===
The mission of the evacuation part is to gather and manage the patient evacuation resources, according to the needs expressed by the chief physician of the PMA. This area is managed by a firefighter officer. The evacuation resources can be firefighter rescue vehicles, private ambulance societies, vehicles from an association, helicopters, etc. The staff takes care that the instructions given by the chief physician are obeyed.

The officer of this zone has a blue chasuble-like jacket with the inscription &quot;&quot;&quot;, and the staff members have a blue armband.

This part is also called &quot;evacuation noria&quot; () or &quot;great noria&quot;.

<doc id="1336181" wikidata="Q5497995" url="?curid=1336181" title="Frederick Hemke">
<text>Frederick L. Hemke &quot;(né&quot; Fred LeRoy Hemke Jr.; July 11, 1935 – April 17, 2019) was an American virtuoso classical saxophonist and influential professor of saxophone at Northwestern University. Hemke helped to increase the popularity of classical saxophone, particularly among leading American composers. He contributed to raising the recognition of the classical saxophone in solo, chamber, and major orchestral repertoire throughout the world. For half a century, from 1962 to 2012, Hemke was a full-time faculty member at Northwestern University&#x27;s Bienen School of Music. In 2002, he was named Associate Dean Emeritus of the school. He retired in 2012. Throughout his career, Hemke helped build American saxophone repertoire through many composers including Muczynski, Creston, Stein, Heiden, and Karlins. Journalist and author Michael Segell, in his 2005 book, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Horn,&quot; called Hemke &quot;The Dean of Saxophone Education in America.&quot; Hemke died on April 17, 2019.

== Formal education ==
From 1955 to 1956, Hemke studied saxophone with Marcel Mule at the Paris Conservatoire National de Musique et de Declamation, earning in 1956 the Premier Prix diploma. Hemke holds the distinction of being the first American saxophonist to earn a Premier Prix diploma from the Paris Conservatory. In 1958, Hemke earned a Bachelor of Science degree in music education from University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. In 1962, he earned a Master of Music degree from the Eastman School of Music. In 1975, Hemke earned a D.M.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In primary and secondary school, until the start of college, Hemke studied saxophone with Eddie Schmidt, a band director in Milwaukee, and a close friend of Ralph Joseph Hermann (1914–1994) — musician, composer, songwriter, and music publisher. Hemke was highly influenced by Schmidt&#x27;s recording of Marcel Mule — and also of his recordings of Al Gallodoro, and Freddy Gardner. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Hemke studied with Jay Morton, teacher of woodwinds. Hemke did not have a formal saxophone teacher at Eastman, but while there, studied reeds with clarinetist Stanley Hasty (1920–2011), flute repertoire with Joseph Mariano (1911–2007), and oboe repertoire with Robert Sprenkle (1914–1988).

==Teaching career==
Hemke taught saxophone at Northwestern&#x27;s School of Music for fifty years. He began in 1962 as a teaching associate. In 1964 he became an assistant professor and was appointed chairman of the newly formed Winds and Percussion Instruments Department. In 1967 Hemke was elevated to associate professor; on September 1, 1975, Full Professor; and on September 1, 1991, chairman of the Department of Music Performance Studies at the School of Music. Hemke served as senior associate dean for administration in the School of Music from 1995 to 2001. In 2002, Hemke was named the Louis and Elsie Snydacker Eckstein Professor of Music and also named associate dean emeritus of the School of Music. He retired from full-time teaching in 2012. As a music educator in higher education, Hemke has taught hundreds of saxophonists, many of whom have flourished as performing artists and music educators of international rank. From 2013 until his death, Hemke served as artistic director and taught during summers at the Frederick L. Hemke Saxophone Institute, located at Snow Pond Center for the Arts in Sidney, ME.

==Other positions==

Hemke was well known as the designer of a line of reeds which bear the trademark &quot;Frederick L. Hemke Reeds.&quot; D&#x27;Addario began making the brand in 1982. Hemke was an artist-clinician for The Selmer Company, the North American distributor of saxophones made in France by the Paris firm, Henri Selmer Paris. In 1979 Hemke was host for the Sixth World Saxophone Congress held at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.

== Performing career ==
Hemke was known worldwide as one of the great classical saxophonists. Hemke has appeared extensively as a solo artist and has given master classes and lectures in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, and the Far East. He performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and many other orchestras. He premiered several works for saxophone, including Allan Pettersson&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 16&quot; (February 24, 1983) and James Di Pasquale&#x27;s &quot;Sonata&quot; for tenor saxophone. Di Pasquale, a prolific composer, had studied saxophone with Hemke and Sigurd Rascher.

;;Selected performances
* Hemke made his New York debut on April 16, 1962, at the Town Hall, a storied concert venue that had its first-ever classical saxophone performance on February 5, 1937 — by Cecil Leeson. Hemke performed compositions by Pascal, Lantier, Rueff, Hartley, and Stein and arrangements by Mule of Bach and Leclair.

== Advocacy for B tenor saxophone ==
Among the instruments in a traditional modern saxophone quartet — B soprano, E alto, B tenor, and E baritone saxophone — classical solos were, and still are, mostly written for the soprano and the alto. Hemke decided to spend time focusing on the tenor saxophone as a classical solo instrument, as evidenced by the release of his 1971 solo album &quot;Music for Tenor Saxophone&quot;. In orchestral music, the tenor saxophone is one of three saxophones heard in Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; — they were originally scored for two players, one on E sopranino and the other alternating between the tenor and the soprano as required. Recordings by tenor saxophone virtuoso James Houlik and others notwithstanding, classical tenor saxophone music is still a very small portion of classical saxophone repertoire and discography.

<doc id="1336186" wikidata="Q1004341" url="?curid=1336186" title="Fun House (The Stooges album)">
<text>Fun House is the second studio album by American rock band the Stooges. It was released on July 7, 1970, by Elektra Records. Though initially commercially unsuccessful, &quot;Fun House&quot; has since developed a strong cult following. Like its predecessor (1969&#x27;s &quot;The Stooges&quot;) and successor (1973&#x27;s &quot;Raw Power&quot;), it is considered an integral work in the development of punk rock.

== Recording sessions ==
In 1969, Elektra Records had released the Stooges&#x27; debut album to mixed reviews and limited commercial success. Elektra head Jac Holzman believed that the MC5, another Michigan-based band, had more commercial potential than the Stooges. Holzman asked former Kingsmen keyboardist Don Gallucci to produce the Stooges&#x27; second album.

Having seen the group live, Gallucci told Holzman that the Stooges were an &quot;interesting group, but I don&#x27;t think you can get this feeling on tape&quot;; Holzman, however, had already reserved recording time for him with the band in Los Angeles. The album was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles from May 11 to 25 of 1970. Gallucci&#x27;s plan as a producer was to use each day to record about a dozen takes of a particular song and then pick the one that would appear on the album. The first day consisted of soundchecks and run-throughs of all songs, with baffles between the amplifiers and drums and Iggy Pop singing his vocals through a studio-style microphone on a boom stand.

The band was not pleased with the resulting sound, and subsequently they and Gallucci stripped the entire studio of its usual equipment and soundproofing to emulate their live performances as closely as possible. Gallucci arranged the band in studio in the way they normally played at a concert, with Pop singing through a handheld dynamic microphone and no baffles between the amplifiers. The results were very raw when compared to contemporary records; for example, without the normal isolation baffles the vibrations from the bass amplifier cause audible rattling of the snare drum on several songs.

Pop indicated that iconic blues singer Howlin&#x27; Wolf &quot;was really pertinent for me on &quot;Fun House&quot;. &quot;That stuff is Wolfy, at least as I could do it.&quot;

The Stooges intended for &quot;Loose&quot; to be the album&#x27;s first track; Elektra, however, felt that &quot;Down on the Street&quot; would be the stronger opener. An alternate version of &quot;Down on the Street&quot;, featuring a Doors-style organ overdub by Gallucci, was released as a single.

== Music and lyrics ==
At the time of its release, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine regarded &quot;Fun House&quot; as being a hard rock album. Music critic Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; characterized the album as &quot;genuinely &#x27;avant-garde&#x27; rock&quot; because of the music&#x27;s apt &quot;repetitiveness&quot;, &quot;solitary new-thing saxophone&quot;, and the closing track, &quot;L.A. Blues&quot;, &quot;trying to make art about chaos by reproducing same.&quot; Author Greg Kot has called &quot;Fun House&quot; a &quot;punk jazz opus&quot;.

In &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005), music journalist Stevie Chick wrote that the sleazy tales of hedonism and reckless abandon on the album&#x27;s first half are followed by &quot;the comedown&quot; on the second side, as evoked by looser song structures, Steve Mackay&#x27;s saxophone, and &quot;Iggy sounding like a scared, lost child, warning from bitter experience that &#x27;The Fun House will steal your heart away.&#x27;&quot; &quot;L.A. Blues&quot; concludes the album with a flurry of noise and disoriented dual drumming, which &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Patrick McNally interpreted as the Stooges being &quot;lost culturally and spiritually in the smoke and riots and confusion of Detroit and America at the dawn of the seventies, but also in the overwhelming squall and clatter of the sound that they—from nothing, from nowhere—managed to create.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

In contemporaneous reviews, Charles Burton from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found &quot;Fun House&quot; to be &quot;much more sophisticated&quot; than the Stooges&#x27; debut album, writing that they sounded &quot;so exquisitely horrible and down and out that they are the ultimate psychedelic rock band in 1970&quot;. Roy Hollingworth of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was unimpressed however, calling it the worst record of the year and &quot;a muddy load of sluggish, unimaginative rubbish heavily disguised by electricity and called American rock&quot;. Robert Christgau wrote in his original review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the Stooges&#x27; successful use of repetition and incorporation of saxophone had intellectual appeal, but questioned whether it was healthy as a listener for &quot;[me] to have to be in a certain mood of desperate abandon before I can get on with them musically&quot;. He later said his criticism had been based on the album&#x27;s &quot;inaccessibility&quot; as popular music, and wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981):

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming hailed &quot;Fun House&quot; as &quot;the ideal document of the Stooges at their raw, sweaty, howling peak&quot;, and wrote that it features better songs than their debut, significant improvement from each member, and Don Gallucci&#x27;s energetic and immediate production. Dalton Ross of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that the &quot;radical&quot; album sounded &quot;primal, unpredictable, dangerous&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Joe Tangari felt that the music&#x27;s aggression has rarely been matched. He recommended it to &quot;any rock fan with a sense of history&quot; and asserted that, along with the Stooges&#x27; debut, &quot;Fun House&quot; is one of the most important predecessors to the punk rock movement. Barney Hoskyns called it a &quot;proto-punk classic&quot;, and Jon Young of &quot;Spin&quot; hailed it as a &quot;proto-punk landmark&quot; that possessed a &quot;magnificent chaos&quot;. According to &quot;Cleveland.com&quot; writer Troy L. Smith, &quot;What was once dismissed as something too raw and primal, now sits as a work of unparalleled hard-rock genius&quot;, while music historian Simon Reynolds says &quot;it clearly stands out as the most powerful hard-rock album of all time.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Fun House&quot; number 191 on their list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revision, and moving it up to number 94 in the 2020 reboot of the list. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said that it is, &quot;no contest, the greatest rock n&#x27; roll album of all time&quot;. Lenny Kaye, writing for eMusic, called it a &quot;rock and roll classic&quot; and &quot;one of the most frontal, aggressive, and joyously manic records ever&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Scott Seward claimed that, although saying so &quot;risks hyperbole&quot;, &quot;Fun House&quot; is &quot;one of the greatest rock &amp; roll records of all time&quot; and that, &quot;as great as they were, the Stones never went so deep, the Beatles never sounded so alive, and anyone would have a hard time matching Iggy Pop&#x27;s ferocity as a vocalist.&quot; Commenting on the initial poor reception the record received from critics, radio and Elektra themselves, Reynolds explained: &quot;&quot;Fun House&quot; was fatally out of synch with 1970, the downbeat year it came out, a year of singer-songwriters and tasty, bluesy licks. Only a few people then had any time for the sound of absolute abandon that The Stooges were making, or unleashing.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==

Australian band Radio Birdman chose their name based on mishearing the line &quot;radio burnin&#x27; up above&quot; in the song &quot;1970&quot;. They also named their Oxford Street performance venue The Oxford Funhouse and covered &quot;TV Eye&quot; on their 1977 album &quot;Radios Appear&quot;.

John Zorn covered &quot;T.V. Eye&quot; for the compilation &quot;Rubáiyát: Elektra&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot;: the same song was also covered for the 1998 film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; by a supergroup featuring Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, members of Sonic Youth, and Ewan McGregor. The Birthday Party covered &quot;Loose&quot; on their 1982 live album &quot;Drunk on the Pope&#x27;s Blood&quot; and, also live, the song &quot;Funhouse&quot;: a version with sax played by J.G. Thirlwell appears on the 1999 CD &quot;The Birthday Party Live 81–82&quot;. the Damned&#x27;s 1977 debut album, &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot;, features a cover of &quot;1970&quot;, entitled &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;. Depeche Mode covered &quot;Dirt&quot; on their I Feel Loved single. GBH covered &quot;1970&quot; (as &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;) on their third album &quot;City Babys Revenge.&quot; A live version of &quot;1970&quot; appears on Mission of Burma&#x27;s posthumous live album &quot;The Horrible Truth About Burma&quot;. &quot;1969&quot; goth-rock band The Sisters of Mercy in Alice EP, 1983. Hanoi Rocks cover &quot;1970&quot; (titled &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;) on their 1984 live album All Those Wasted Years. Spacemen 3 adapted &quot;T.V. Eye&quot; into the near-cover &quot;OD Catastrophe&quot; on their debut album &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot;. Michael Monroe also covered the song for his &quot;Another Night in the Sun&quot; live album in 2010. In 1989 indie rock band Blake Babies covered &quot;Loose&quot; for their album &quot;Earwig&quot;. They sampled Pop&#x27;s voice into the song. Rage Against the Machine recorded &quot;Down on the Street&quot; for their 2000 covers album &quot;Renegades&quot;, and the main riff from their song &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; was inspired by the one in &quot;T.V. Eye.&quot; A cover of &quot;Dirt&quot; appears on disc one of Screeching Weasel&#x27;s 1999 double CD compilation &quot;Thank You Very Little&quot;.

In 2010, Nigerian songwriter Billy Bao and his band went into the studio exactly 40 years after the recording of the album and recorded their album &quot;Buildings from Bilbao&quot; using all titles and song times for their own songs (except &quot;1970&quot;, which is updated as &quot;2010&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Blues&quot;, which is called &quot;LAGOS Blues&quot;). &quot;Down on the Street&quot; briefly appears on the song &quot;Maggot Death (Live at Brighton)&quot; off of the Throbbing Gristle album &quot;The Second Annual Report&quot;, as a field recording of a club playing the song over the P.A. system.

Joey Ramone, Mark E. Smith, Jack White, Nick Cave, Michael Gira, Buzz Osborne, Aaron North, Henry Rollins and Steve Albini. are among the artists who cited &quot;Fun House&quot; as a favourite album. &quot;The greatest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record ever made,&quot; enthused White. &quot;It is a brilliant, brilliant record. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll ever be topped.&quot;

In 1999, Rhino Records released a limited edition box set, &quot;1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions&quot;, featuring every take of every song from every day of the recording sessions, plus the single versions of &quot;Down on the Street&quot; and &quot;1970&quot;. On August 16, 2005, the album was reissued by Elektra and Rhino as a two-CD set featuring a newly remastered version of the album on disc one and outtakes (essentially highlights from the &quot;Complete Fun House Sessions&quot; box set). Contributing a quote to Pop biographer Paul Trynka&#x27;s liner notes for the reissue, Jack White dubbed &quot;Fun House&quot; &quot;by proxy the definitive rock album of America&quot;.

In 2005, the Stooges performed the album live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series. &quot;Dirt&quot; was ranked number 46 on Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Guitar Solos&quot; list in 2010.

The title track was on the soundtrack to the 2004 video game MTX Mototrax, &quot;1970&quot; appeared in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot; the same year and &quot;Down on the Street&quot; appeared in &quot;&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot; in 2020 during The Cayo Perico Heist Update on the station K.U.L.T 99.1 FM

The album had sold 89,000 copies through March 2000.

<text>Region 4 was an administrative region of the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, from 2000 to 2006, situated almost exactly in the middle of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. It contained the north-western suburbs of Johannesburg as well as western Randburg to the north and Florida to the south-west. Its central and south-eastern area stretches from Bosmont to Pageview, and south of that is the undeveloped belt of land that stretches along Main Reef Road. Starting in the north and proceeding clockwise, it bordered Regions 3, 8, 9, 10, 6, and 5. The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

<text>Lorraine Zillner Rodgers (September 11, 1920 – July 3, 2018) was a Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) pilot for the United States Army Air Forces.

==Background==
Born Lorraine Zillner in Park Ridge, Illinois, she went on to graduate from the University of Illinois and began working in the office of Chicago&#x27;s Douglas Aircraft facility. Fascinated with aircraft since childhood, she would spend her free time on the factory floor, admiring the C-54 Skymasters being produced there. After a test pilot took her for a ride in one, she began weekend flying lessons in a Piper J-3 Cub.

==WASPs==
Once the United States committed its involvement in World War II and male pilots were being called to serve, the WASP program was created for domestic support. Zillner had read that interviews for women with pilot licenses were being held for the experimental program. Despite not having a license and, initially, only eight of the 35 required hours of flight time, she was accepted for training two weeks later via telegram from the Department of the Army.

Zillner began six months of classroom and flight training in September 1943 at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. After graduating in February 1944, she reported for duty with the 5th Ferrying Group at Dallas Love Field. On December 20, 1944, General Henry H. Arnold dissolved the WASP program and Zillner was honorably discharged.

==Personal life==
Upon returning to Illinois, Zillner began working at Naval Air Station Glenview and met George Franklin Rodgers, a naval aviator. They were later married for 33 years, until his death shortly after retiring. She relocated to the original grounds of Mount Vernon in Alexandria, Virginia, and lived there until her death at age 97 on July 3, 2018.

==Media==
In the TV show &quot;Legends of Airpower&quot;, Rodgers life is covered in Season-4.

<text>Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit (from &quot;Khaya lami&quot;, &quot;My home&quot; in Zulu) is a motor racing circuit located in Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa, just north of Johannesburg. The circuit has been used for Grand Prix and Formula One races and has hosted the South African Grand Prix twenty times. Among the Formula One races held at the track the 1977 South African Grand Prix stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver Tom Pryce. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of Johannesburg. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the Superbike World Championship from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the Superstars Series in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix season. International racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the 2019 Kyalami 9 Hours, serving as the season finale of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge.

== History ==
The original, sweeping circuit was designed and cleared by Harry Pierce and Dick Bremner along with a few friends and workers in the mid-1950s. The two were also responsible for the hosting and housing of early race teams that ventured to Africa to try out the new track with Bremner being the chairman of the South African Automotive Racing Association. Its first major international event was in 1961 until political sanctions (due to apartheid policies) eliminated the Grand Prix after the 1985 race. 

===Original layout: 1961-1987===
The clockwise track layout was based on a long straight with nine corners that had their naming inspired by a mix of local geography, South African cultural elements, and racing terminology. A lap started in close to the pit lane entrance on the Main Straight - a straight that lead downhill into the first bend.
# Crowthorne Corner – A tight right-hander, being the first turn after the start-finish straight. The corner was named after the Crowthorne Hotel, located near this particular section of the circuit.
# Barbecue Bend A second right-hand medium speed bend likely named after the tradition of South African barbecues (braais), which were often held near this section of the track during race events.
# Jukskei Sweep This was a long, fast left-hand curve, named for the Jukskei River, which runs near the track. The river itself is named after the traditional Afrikaaner game of Jukskei (similar to horse-shoes), which was played by early settlers.
# Sunset Bend A fast right-hander considered one of the iconc corners on the track. It was so named because the corner often forced drives to face the setting sun while navigating this section of the track.
# Clubhouse Bend A 90-degree left-hander named after the motorsport clubhouse that was located at this bend on the track.
# Esses 1 Bend one: initial left-hander.
# Esses 2. Right-handed 90-degree bend, leading to steep uphill into turn 8.
# Leeukop Bend Leeukop was a tight right-hand hairpin that led onto the initial part of the long straight. This corner was named after Leeukop hill (Lion’s Head), a common and prominent geographical naming feature in South African topography. It also referred to the Leeukop Prison that was located behind the hill on adjacent land.
# The Kink This was a right deviation in the track splitting the main straight into two sections.

===Revised layout: 1988 to present===
When the circuit was rebuilt in the early 1990s as part of a commercial development, Leeukop Bend, the Kink, Pit lane, the start/finish straight, Crowthorne Corner and Barbeque Bend were all eliminated. Jukskei Sweep was heavily modified to create the entrance into the bend before the then newly built Pit lane and start/finish straight. The remaining part of the old fast circuit, modified to a lesser degree were Sunset Bend, Clubhouse Bend and the Esses still incorporated into the current configuration, with the result that the circuit became a narrow, twisty ribbon rather than one of the fastest circuits on the calendar. Formula One abandoned the rebuilt circuit in 1993 after just two races on the new layout, caused by a bankruptcy on the part of the promoter.

It hosted the South African motorcycle Grand Prix until 1992.

Kyalami was changed again with the building of the current pit lane and start/finish straight and later again changes were made, with the addition of a chicane which in turn was removed again for the 2009 World Superbike race. Kyalami came under new management and 2008 saw the 50th anniversary of the 9-hour revival being held at Kyalami with golden oldies like David Piper and others. On 6 June 2014, it was announced that Kyalami would be auctioned off on 24 July without reserve. On 24 July 2014, it was auctioned off for R205 million. The winning bidder was Toby Venter, owner of Porsche South Africa. R100 million was invested to upgrade the circuit, allowing it to successfully obtain an FIA Grade 2 status.

On 12 December 2019, the provisional calendar for the 2020–21 FIA World Endurance Championship was announced, containing a six-hour race at Kyalami scheduled for 6 February 2021. However, after the calendar was revised due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kyalami was removed.

==Layout history==
==South African Grand Prix==
From 1967 to 1993, Kyalami hosted 21 editions of the South African Grand Prix. Perhaps the most infamous of these was the 1982 edition, when the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association staged a strike in protest of new superlicence conditions imposed by FISA.

Niki Lauda became the most successful driver at Kyalami, taking his third victory at the circuit in 1984. Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell and Jackie Stewart are the joint second-most successful drivers at the circuit, with two wins each. Jody Scheckter became the first and only South African driver to win their home race during the 1975 edition. Ferrari and Williams are the most successful constructors at the circuit, with four wins each.

In June 2022 it was reported that Stefano Domenicali, the President of Formula One, had flown to South Africa to meet representatives of the circuit about a possible return for F1 in 2023, but was not included in the 2023 provisional calendar.

<text>Campton is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Campton and Chicksands, in the Central Bedfordshire district of Bedfordshire, England. It is about south of Bedford, and is about north-west from Letchworth and sits on a tributary of the River Ivel. It is just to the west of Shefford. The 13th century Church of All Saints is in the centre of the village. In 1961 the parish had a population of 358.

== History ==
Campton is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The entry reads: &quot; Chambeltone: Ralph de Lanquetot from Walter Giffard; Fulbert from Willian d&#x27;Eu; Thurstan.&quot; The name Campton is derived from a British stream name similar to the name Camel in Cornwall.

On 1 April 1985 the parish was abolished and merged with Chicksands to form &quot;Campton &amp; Chicksands&quot;.

==Governance==
Campton is in the Hitchin parliamentary constituency and the elected member is Alistair Strathern of the Labour Party.

==Education==

It is in the catchment zone for Robert Bloomfield Academy. It is also in the catchment zone for Samuel Whitbread Academy, which has an upper school and sixth form.

<text>Region 5 was an administrative district in the City of Johannesburg, from 2000 to 2006, covering the greater Roodepoort, Randburg, Olivedale and Northriding areas on the western flank of the City of Johannesburg. Its long western boundary forms most of the unicity&#x27;s western boundary. To the north (Region 1) and east (Regions 2, 3, and 4) it shared boundaries with largely prosperous residential areas. To the south, it met the northern boundary of Region 6, Doornkop/Soweto. The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

<text>Region 6 was an administrative district in the City of Johannesburg, from 2000 to 2006, South Africa. It was situated towards the south west of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. It abutted the city&#x27;s Mining Belt in the north or the southern boundary of Region 5 (Roodepoort) and from there stretched south to meet Region 11 (Ennerdale and Orange Farm). Its western boundary, which projected further west than any other region, formed the periphery of its area of Johannesburg. On the east, Region 6 shared its boundary with the other Soweto region, Region 10. The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

<doc id="1336208" wikidata="Q378272" url="?curid=1336208" title="The Stooges (album)">
<text>The Stooges is the debut studio album by American rock band the Stooges, released on August 5, 1969 by Elektra Records. Considered a landmark proto-punk release, the album peaked at number 106 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart. The tracks &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; and &quot;1969&quot; were released as singles; &quot;1969&quot; was featured on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs&quot; at number 35. In 2020, it was ranked number 488 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

== Background and recording ==

For their first album, the Stooges had intended to record seven songs: &quot;I&#x27;m Sick&quot;, “Asthma Attack”, &quot;Dance Of The Romance&quot; / “Goodbye Bozos”, No Fun&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, and &quot;1969&quot;. “I’m Sick” was a bolero that Iggy Pop had written on a Wurlitzer electronic piano and when performed live he would flop around on the stage going, “I’m sick! I’m siiiick! I’m sick! Blah!”. &quot;Asthma Attack&quot; was a completely different composition than the version of the song utilizing the same song title that appears on the album reissue. According to Iggy Pop, &quot;&#x27;Asthma Attack&#x27; was a structured piece of repetitive descending chording that sounded a lot like Pink Floyd psychedelic space rock song &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. He elaborates further, &quot;And it was B major, A major, G major, &amp; E major like a Who thing – and then I would wheeze and say, &#x27;asthma attack.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Dance Of The Romance&quot; / &quot;Goodbye Bozos&quot; was an early version of what became known as &quot;Little Doll&quot; without the Ron Asheton guitar audio feedback cacophony known as &quot;Goodbye Bozos&quot; that originally ended the Psychedelic Stooges live performances of 1968. 

&quot;No Fun&quot; took inspiration from the Johnny Cash country song &quot;I Walk The Line&quot; and the main guitar riff to &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; took inspiration from the opening guitar riff to &quot;Highway Chile&quot; by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Early versions of all seven songs were initially written from mid-late 1968 and early 1969. These seven songs were staples—and essentially the basis—of the Stooges&#x27; 1968 and early 1969 live set at the time. A typical Stooges song of the period would involve either two minutes of composed song followed by several minutes of improvisation or avant-garde, free-form workouts. Having assumed that the seven songs as normally performed would cover requirements for the album, the Stooges were told by their record label Elektra that they needed more material. Pop later recalled: &quot;We auditioned [the seven-song version of the album] live in the studio and they refused it. Jac Holzman, head of Elektra Records, is quoted having said, &#x27;Are those three tracks (“1969”, “I Wanna Be Your Dog”, “No Fun”) all you have? Do you guys have enough material? Do you have more songs?” After Ron Asheton replied, “Yeah, we just showed you one part of the pie. We’ve got several more songs.” Jac Holzman then is reported to have uttered his famous line to the group, “Good to hear. You fellas have 5 days.” before leaving the control room of The Hit Factory recording studio&#x27; 

The band wrote three completely new compositions over the course of the five day recording sessions to complete the album. The songs were &quot;We Will Fall&quot; (based upon a musical chant by Dave Alexander), &quot;Real Cool Time&quot;, and “Not Right”. “Little Doll&quot; (based upon the previous “The Dance Of Romance” with an additional opening bass guitar riff. After producer John Cale informed the band that they needed &quot;one more song to complete the album&quot;, Iggy revised &quot;Ann&quot; which was the first song he wrote for The Stooges that was initially discarded by the band in 1968.

Three of the four avant-garde instrumental songs with Iggy Pop improvisatory and rudimentary vocal fragments including chants, howls, screams, and yelps were now properly restructured and edited into pre-existing original songs with only the guitar and bass feedback laden cacophony entitled “Goodbye Bozos” of the two part “Dance Of The Romance” / “Goodbye Bozos” being completely discarded for the revised list repertoire of original songs recorded for the album. &quot;I’m Sick&quot; the three chord composition built upon the Cuban bolero-beat was now subsumed into the composition &quot;Ann&quot; (not “Dance Of The Romance” as mistakenly previously reported) and tacked on as a musical coda after the ballad main song piece. &quot;Dance Of The Romance&quot; also based upon the Bo Diddley beat, with an additional chord sequence and structured lyric now became revised as &quot;Little Doll&quot;. Lastly, the Pink Floyd psychedelic instrumental song &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; structured piece known as &quot;Asthma Attack&quot; was now jettisoned for a more unstructured free-form freak out piece which was newly improvised yet retained the original song title and was recorded during the original album recording sessions.

All restructured and edited compositions were now played and recorded for the first time in the studio. An initial mix by John Cale, apparently resembling ex-Velvet Underground bandmate Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;closet mix&quot; of that band&#x27;s eponymous third album from the same year, was rejected by Elektra. The mix as heard on the final product was done by Iggy Pop and Elektra president Jac Holzman. Four of Cale&#x27;s original mixes would later appear on the bonus disc of a 2005 reissued version, with pitch correction applied to them. Five years later, all eight Cale mixes were released unaltered on the first disc of a 2010 collector&#x27;s edition release of the album.

== Reception and legacy ==

According to music historian Denise Sullivan, &quot;The Stooges&quot; was &quot;disavowed&quot; by most critics; Sullivan nonetheless called it &quot;a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll classic&quot;. In a contemporary review, Edmund O. Ward of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;loud, boring, tasteless, unimaginative and childish&quot;, while conceding that he &quot;kind of liked it&quot;. Robert Christgau gave it a backhanded compliment in his column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, deeming it &quot;stupid-rock at its best&quot;, but did give it a &quot;B+&quot; grade overall.

In retrospect, Will Hodgkinson called &quot;The Stooges&quot; &quot;charged and brutal garage-rock&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Joe Tangari said it was one of the essential forerunners to the punk rock movement of the 1970s. It and the Stooges&#x27; next two albums were later deemed &quot;proto-punk landmarks&quot;, according to &quot;Mojo&quot; journalist Manish Agarwal. Daryl Easlea, writing for BBC Music, called the album &quot;rock at its most primordial. ... [the] album is the original punk rock rush on record, a long-held well-kept secret by those in the know.&quot; Mark Deming of AllMusic commented, &quot;Part of the fun of &quot;The Stooges&quot; is, then as now, the band managed the difficult feat of sounding ahead of their time and entirely out of their time, all at once.&quot;

In 2003, the album was placed at number 185 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the rating in its 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 488 in its 2020 list. The magazine also included &quot;1969&quot; in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;. Seth Jacobson, writing in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, said that the album was &quot;a collection of brilliant curios, which were neither full-on garage rock, nor out-and-out dirge.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; at number 13 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Tracks&quot;.

== Reissues ==
On August 16, 2005, Elektra and Rhino Records jointly re-issued the album as a specially-priced double CD, with a remastered version of the album on disc one and alternate takes on disc two. On May 7, 2010, Rhino again released the album in their &quot;Handmade&quot; series as a collector&#x27;s package including two CDs, a 7&quot; record and a 7&quot;x7&quot;-sized booklet. The first disc features the main songs, the single version of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, and all original John Cale mixes of the eight songs. The second disc, and both sides of the 7&quot; single, contain the previously unissued &quot;Asthma Attack&quot;, a staple of the group&#x27;s early live shows. 

On November 8, 2019, Rhino released the &quot;50th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition&quot; of the album on digital services and streaming platforms. This “2019 Remaster” version mirrors the contents of the 2010 double-disc set and includes John Cale&#x27;s rejected mix of the original album, released at the correct speed for the first time. In 2020, Vinyl Me, Please reissued the album on vinyl using the rejected John Cale mixes. This was the first time the tracks have ever appeared on a vinyl pressing.

<text>Guillermo Antonio Rodríguez Lara (born 4 November 1923), known as &quot;Bombita&quot;, is an Ecuadorian former political and military leader who was dictator of Ecuador from 15 February 1972 to 11 January 1976.

==Biography==
Rodríguez was born in Pujilí, Cotopaxi on 4 November 1923. He took courses in C&amp;R&amp;Bn Staff, Irregular Warfare Orientation, and Maintenance Management at the School of the Americas located in Panama. As commander of the army, he led a military coup d&#x27;etat executed by a navy commander named Jorge Queirolo G. and forced president José María Velasco into exile, to Buenos Aires, Argentina. During his rule, drilling the country&#x27;s oil reserves funded the construction of hospitals, schools, roads (notably, paving the Quito-Tulcán road), the oil refinery at Esmeraldas, and new equipment for the armed services. The Ecuadorian military removed him from power in 1976.

Rodríguez turned 100 on 4 November 2023. He is now the oldest living former state leader in the world.

<text>Region 7 was an administrative district in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, from 2000 to 2006. It included the densely populated Alexandra township and the town of Modderfontein and was one of Johannesburg&#x27;s eastern boundary sections, situated in the north-east of the city. Regions 2 (Midrand), 3 (Sandton), and 8 (Central) were to its west, with Midrand also forming its northern boundary. It touched on Region 9 (Johannesburg South) in the south. Its position gives it good access to the City&#x27;s eastern neighbours, such as Kempton Park and Germiston. The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

<doc id="1336212" wikidata="Q1520583" url="?curid=1336212" title="Haynes, Bedfordshire">
<text>Haynes is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England, about seven miles (11 km) south of Bedford. It includes the small hamlet of Haynes Church End. It used to be known as Hawnes. North from Haynes is a hamlet named Silver End, then further up is Herrings Green, Cotton End and Shortstown. There is a pub, &quot;The Greyhound&quot;, a shop, a post office, a village hall and a Lower School.

In 1730 the philosopher John Gay became Vicar of Wilshamstead (later adding the living of Haynes).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Haynes&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Hagenes&quot;. This derives from an Old English word *&quot;hægen&quot; or *&quot;hagen&quot; meaning &#x27;enclosure&#x27;, in its plural form.

==Manor==

Haynes or Hawnes Manor belonged to Sir Robert Newdigate, who died in 1613, and King James was a regular visitor. Anne of Denmark came in July 1605 and was entertained by a Scottish singing woman and Morris dancers. King James came to Haynes on 22 July 1615. The next day he heard that his brother-in-law Christian IV was in London at Denmark House, and he raced back riding through a hail storm.

Haynes manor was acquired in about 1667 by Vice Admiral Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet (c.1610-1680) of Jersey.

The present mansion of Haynes Park was built c.1725 by his son John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville.
==Education==
The majority of this community is in the catchment zone for Robert Bloomfield Academy.

The majority of this community is in the catchment area for Samuel Whitbread Academy, which has upper secondary and sixth form.

<text>Region 9 was an administrative district from 2000 to 2006 in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, situated in the south-eastern corner of Johannesburg. To the north it met the Inner City along the Mining Belt and the M2. To the east and south, it formed the boundary of Johannesburg. Its neighbours to the west were Region 10 (the Diepkloof/Meadowlands region of Soweto) and Region 11 (Ennerdale/Orange Farm). Its south-eastern position means that it shared boundaries with the neighbouring municipal areas of Germiston and Alberton. The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

<text>Northwick Park Hospital (NWPH) is a major National Health Service hospital situated in the town of Harrow, North West London, managed by the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust. It is located off Watford Road in the London Borough of Brent; closely bordering the London Borough of Harrow.

==History==
The hospital was commissioned by the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in the late 1960s, designed by the British architect John Weeks and built by Trollope &amp; Colls. The design of the hospital was largely inspired by British obsolescence studies, in which a loose-jointed medical complex was created with flexibility to withstand obsolescence&#x27;s unpredictable effects. With only a fixed internal street system, the architects referred to the hospital as &quot;an indeterminate architecture&quot; with &quot;no final plan&quot; – free to grow and change over time. It was opened by the Queen on 10 October 1970. It takes its name from Northwick Park, which lies besides the hospital.

In 1994, St Mark&#x27;s Hospital, previously located 10 miles away in central London, moved into a wing of the hospital formerly occupied by the Medical Research Council.

In 1997, the hospital returned the worst figures for operations cancelled in the UK. The closure of Edgware General Hospital earlier that year was cited by some as a reason.

In 2005, the hospital&#x27;s maternity department was named as having one of the highest death rates in the United Kingdom. During the period April 2002 to March 2004, the maternal death rate for the maternity unit was 74.2 per 100,000, 6.5 times the national average of 11.4 per 100,000, as reported by Cemach (Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health). A range of &quot;special measures&quot; designed to improve maternity services and public confidence in the services was agreed with the Trust and these were all complied with within a year, but as of 2016 the Trust&#x27;s maternity and gynaecology services were rated as &quot;requires improvement&quot; by the Care Quality Commission.

A 2016 Care Quality Commission report rated Northwick Park Hospital as &quot;requires improvement&quot; overall, with only one out of eight assessment areas attaining a better rating. The report highlighted a number of concerns found during inspection visits, including that surgical staff were not always reporting incidents, patients experienced long waits, compliance with safeguarding training was poor, examples of poor infection control practice, a poor environment on the stroke wards, and that nutrition and hydration was poorly managed. The Commission subsequently issued the Trust with a Section 29 (A) warning notice.

==Facilities==
The hospital provides a full range of services including paediatrics, maxillofacial, orthopaedics, neurology, cardiology, elderly care medicine and a regional rehabilitation unit for patients with additional ongoing acute medical needs.
St Mark&#x27;s Hospital, a national centre of gastrointestinal medicine, is based at the same site, as is the British Olympic Association&#x27;s Olympic Medical Institute.

Local charity Radio Harrow is based within the hospital and has provided a patient visiting and broadcasting service since 1971.

Northwick Park is one of the few hospitals in England to have a paternoster lift transport system. Despite being out of use for several years, it was brought back into service during 2020.

== Research ==
Medical research has been conducted at Northwick Park Hospital since its founding. In 1994, some research programs were formalised into an independent charity, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research (NPIMR), which now operates under the brand name of The Griffin Institute. The institute, founded by Colin Green, does translational research.

=== TGN incident ===

On 13 March 2006, six men in a clinical trial at the independent Parexel drug trial unit (which is not run by London North West Healthcare NHS Trust) became severely unwell following administration of theralizumab during a first-in-human clinical trial. They were transferred to the intensive therapy unit at Northwick Park. Affected patients developed multi-organ failure and required intensive medical support by the critical care team at Northwick Park, led by Dr Ganesh Suntharalingam.

==Notable staff and patients==
* Simon Le Bon worked as a theatre porter at Northwick Park Hospital before becoming the lead singer for Duran Duran.
* &quot;Jeeves&quot;, the UK&#x27;s first ever robot nurse, worked at the hospital for six months in 1996-1997 until it &quot;failed&quot; its probation period.
* General Augusto Pinochet was a patient at Northwick Park Hospital in January 2000 while fighting extradition for murder and torture.

==In popular culture==
Northwick Park is the setting for the Channel 4 British sitcom &quot;Green Wing&quot;.

The hospital features in the seventh series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;.

In the 1976 film &quot;The Omen&quot;, the external scene when Katherine&#x27;s body falls from a window and crashes into a parked ambulance was filmed at Northwick Park Hospital.

In episode 6, series 1 of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (&quot;The Germans&quot;), Sybil Fawlty a shot of the entrance of Northwick Park Hospital is used for the opening of the episode.

Northwick Park Hospital features in the ITV2 reality show &quot;Emergency Nurses&quot;, which started airing in June 2022.

<text>Preston Road is a London Underground station in Preston Road in the London Borough of Brent. It is on the Metropolitan line between Northwick Park and Wembley Park stations and is in Travelcard Zone 4. It serves the local area of Preston in Wembley and parts of Kenton.

It is served by &quot;all stations&quot; trains only (northbound fast and semi-fast trains do not stop at stations between Wembley Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill).

==History==
The Metropolitan Railway was extended from to Harrow on 2 August 1880, but originally there were no stations between and Harrow. A station on the eastern side of the Preston Road bridge was opened on 21 May 1908, and was originally named &quot;Preston Road Halt for Uxendon and Kenton&quot;; it was later renamed &quot;Preston Road&quot;. During 1931–32, it was re-sited on the opposite side of the road bridge, and the work was carried out in two stages: the southbound platform was re-sited on 22 November 1931, and the northbound on 3 January 1932.

==Decorations==

The horticultural displays on the platform have won many awards over the years, but fell into disrepair for some years. With the current refurbishment of the station the floral decorations have since been revived, providing a cheerful touch of colour and a point of interest to entertain the traveller in the wait between trains.

== Services ==
The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 2tph Northbound to Amersham (all stations)
* 2tph Northbound to Chesham (all stations)
* 8tph Northbound to Uxbridge (all stations)
* 4tph Northbound to Watford (all stations)
* 4tph Southbound to Baker Street (all stations)
* 12tph Southbound to Aldgate via Baker Street (all stations)
The peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 2tph Northbound (morning peak only) to Amersham (all stations)
* 2pth Northbound (morning peak only) to Chesham (all stations)
* 10tph Northbound to Uxbridge (all stations)
* 4tph Southbound to Baker Street (all stations)
* 12tph Southbound to Aldgate via Baker Street (all stations)
Note that during evening peaks, services to Amersham or Chesham from Preston Road or Northwick Park require a change at Harrow-On-The-Hill.

During the morning peak (06:30 to 09:30), Fast services from Amersham and Chesham run non-stop southbound only between Moor Park, Harrow-On-The-Hill and Finchley Road whilst Semi-fast services from Watford and Uxbridge run non-stop southbound only between Harrow-On-The-Hill and Finchley Road. During the evening peak (16:30–19:30), Fast and Semi-fast services, which operate northbound only call additionally at Wembley Park.

<text>Carl Thomas Curtis (March 15, 1905 – January 24, 2000) was an American attorney and politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska. He served as a Republican in the United States House of Representatives (1939–1954) and later the United States Senate (1955–1979). He remains the second longest-serving Senator from Nebraska.

==Early life==

Curtis was born on his family&#x27;s farm in Kearney County, Nebraska, near the county seat of Minden. He attended public schools and later attended Nebraska Wesleyan University, where he was a member of Theta Chi. He studied law on his own, passed the bar exam, and began practicing; he served as the county attorney of Kearney County, Nebraska, from 1931 to 1934.

==Career==

Curtis was elected to the House of Representatives in 1938 on an anti-New Deal platform. He served from 1939 until 1954, being reelected every two years. He ran for the Senate from Nebraska in 1954 and won; subsequently, incumbent Hazel Abel resigned, and Curtis was appointed to the seat on January 1, 1955, getting a two-day jump on seniority. Curtis thus became the last of six Senators to serve during the fifteenth Senate term for Nebraska&#x27;s Class 2 seat, from January 3, 1949, to January 3, 1955. He was reelected three more times to six-year terms, serving from 1955 to 1979.

Curtis voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. Curtis was loyal to the Republican Party, particularly supporting its anti-communist stances and fiscal conservatism, which included opposition to social programs such as the New Deal and the Great Society.

During the 1963 investigation of bribery allegations against Democratic Party organizer Robert Baker, Curtis supposedly leaked a secret memorandum to advance his own positions.

A close ally of both Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon, Curtis served as floor leader during the 1964 Republican National Convention, when Goldwater won the nomination.

During the early 1970s, Curtis supported President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Vietnam War escalation policy, and remained loyal to him throughout the Watergate Scandal. On August 6, 1974, two days before Nixon resigned, he implored Congress not to panic. He warned that the United States would become like a &quot;banana republic&quot; if Nixon was ousted in favor of Vice President Ford, who in turn would then select someone to fill the vice presidential slot. He said &quot;this would mean both Ford and the new Vice President would be men who hadn&#x27;t been elected to their high office, but merely nominated by a President under procedures for filling the vice presidency when it is vacant.&quot;

Curtis served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1975 to 1979.

==Later life==

Following his retirement, Curtis moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he practiced law, served as an officer of the conservative lobby the American Freedom Coalition, and gave occasional interviews to the media.

Curtis died in Lincoln on January 24, 2000, and is interred at Minden Cemetery in Minden, his longtime hometown. Following his death, he was praised on the floor by Strom Thurmond, a contemporary who had also been first elected to the Senate in 1954.

Historically, the town of Moirang is famous for the ancient temple of the deity, Thangching (Thangjing) and the legendary love story of &quot;Khamba Thoibi&quot;. In a village named Ngangkhaleikai, the old cloth used by Khamba and Nongban are still preserved. The epic story of &quot;Khamba-Thoibi&quot; begins between a beautiful princess name Thoibi daughter of Wangon Ningthou Chingkhu Naha Telheiba, and an orphan man named Khuman Khamba. Khamba was raised up by her own sister when both their parents died when they were very young. Khamnu used to go around the village for pounding grain and lend a hand to others household works at her young age. In return she fed her brother from the less amount of grain that others paid in gratitude of helping to their household works.

* Indian National Army (INA) complex: Apart from being an ancient suzerainty, Moirang today, is all the more akin to India&#x27;s political history. It was on 14 April 1944 that the flag of the Indian National Army (INA) was for the second time hoisted on the Indian Soil of Moirang (first time tri colour flag for Indian Independence hoisted by himself Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, INA Chief Commander &amp; President of Indian National Government in Port Blair- Shahid Swaraj Dweep on 30 December 1943) about 45 km away from Imphal, the capital of Manipur.

<text>Richard Allan &quot;Rick&quot; Salomon (born January 24, 1969) is an American high-stakes poker player, who is best known for his 2004 sex tape with Paris Hilton. He had high-profile marriages with E.G. Daily, Shannen Doherty, and Pamela Anderson. As a poker player, Salomon won $2.8 million in 2014, $3.3 million in 2016, and $2.84 million in the 2018 versions of the World Series of Poker&#x27;s Big One for One Drop.

==Early life==
Salomon was born and raised in Neptune Township, New Jersey. He is Jewish.

==Career==
Salomon owned an online gambling site.

On July 1, 2014, he won $2.8 million in the World Series of Poker&#x27;s Big One for One Drop. Four years later, he won $2.84 million at the same event.

Salomon has made regular TV poker appearances on PokerGO shows including World Series of Poker coverage, Super High Roller Bowl coverage, &quot;Rob&#x27;s Home Game&quot;, &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;, and &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;. Salomon was one of the new players appearing in Season 8 of &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot; and appeared in the first eight episodes. Salomon played one of the biggest pots of the season against Bryn Kenney, when he beat Kenney&#x27;s set with a straight, winning $868,200.

As of February 2021, Salomon has not been cashing since 2018, after accumulating live tournament winnings in excess of $9.9 million.

==Personal life==

===Sex tape===
In 2003, a sex tape featuring Salomon and then-girlfriend Paris Hilton was leaked onto the Internet. Shortly afterward, Salomon filed a lawsuit against the company that distributed the tape, and against the Hilton family, whom he accused of tarnishing his reputation by suggesting that he had exploited Hilton. Salomon further claimed in his $10 million suit that representatives of the Hiltons tried to discourage media outlets from playing excerpts of the tape by saying that Hilton was underage when the tape was made (which would have made showing the tape illegal – Hilton was actually 19 when the tape was filmed), and were attempting to crush him to preserve the image they had created for her. Hilton later sued the company that released the tape, Kahatani Ltd., for $30 million for violation of privacy and emotional distress.

In April 2004, Salomon began distributing the tape himself through the adult film company Red Light District Video under the title &quot;1 Night in Paris&quot;. In July 2004, Salomon dropped his lawsuit against the Hilton family after Paris Hilton&#x27;s privacy lawsuit was thrown out of court. Salomon and Red Light District Video agreed to pay Hilton $400,000 plus a percentage of the tape&#x27;s sale profit.

===Marriages===
In 1995, Salomon married voice actress Elizabeth Daily. The couple had two daughters, before divorcing in 2000.

In 2002, Salomon married actress Shannen Doherty. The marriage was annulled after nine months.

On September 29, 2007, Salomon and actress Pamela Anderson applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas. Anderson had told talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres in September that she was engaged; she referred to her fiancé only as a poker player. The couple married on October 6, 2007, during a break between the 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. shows of &quot;Hans Klok&#x27;s The Beauty of Magic&quot; at Planet Hollywood resort, where Anderson was starring as a magician&#x27;s assistant. Salomon and Anderson separated less than ten weeks later and, on December 14, Anderson filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Two days later, Anderson and Salomon were seen shopping together. Anderson later posted a message on her website indicating that they were reconciling. On December 28, 2007, Anderson&#x27;s attorney filed a proof of service of summons in Los Angeles Superior Court regarding the divorce claim. In February 2008, Anderson filed to have the marriage annulled, citing fraud. The following month, Salomon also filed for an annulment, and also cited fraud. The marriage was annulled on March 24, 2008.

In January 2014, Anderson announced that she and Salomon had married on an unspecified date.

Anderson again filed for divorce from Salomon on July 3, 2014, while Salomon filed for an annulment in Nevada on grounds of fraud. On April 29, 2015, her divorce was granted, with a $1 million settlement payment from Salomon to Anderson.

<text>Christopher John Dyke Acland (7 September 1966 – 17 October 1996) was an English drummer and songwriter. He was the drummer of the London-based alternative rock band Lush.

==Early life==
Acland was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary in Lancaster, Lancashire, the youngest of three sons of paper manufacturer Oliver Geoffrey Dyke Acland, of Barnsdale, Burneside, Cumbria, who had served as a second lieutenant in the Border Regiment, and Judith Veronica Willans. He was the great-grandson of Sir Francis Dyke Acland, 14th Baronet. He studied at North London Polytechnic, where he met his future Lush bandmates Meriel Barham and Miki Berenyi, briefly dating the latter.

==Career==
He played in a number of bands, including The Infection, Les Turds, A Touch of Hysteria and Panic, before founding Lush in 1988 with Steve Rippon, Emma Anderson, Meriel Barham and Miki Berenyi. After personnel changes gave way to a stable lineup, Lush released their debut mini album, &quot;Scar&quot;, and developed a following as a live act. They would go on to release three albums and several singles and EPs and achieve critical success.

==Personal life and death==
Acland was a keen football fan and a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. He and members of Moose and Cocteau Twins formed the group The Lillies and recorded a humorous flexi-disc entitled &quot;And David Seaman Will Be Very Disappointed About That&quot; following the team&#x27;s victory over North London rivals Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-finals.

On 17 October 1996, Lush had completed their tour and music festival appearances. Two days after Anderson announced a desire to quit the group, Acland was found dead as a result of suicide by hanging in his parents&#x27; garden in Burneside, Cumbria. Devastated by the news, Acland&#x27;s bandmates subsequently disbanded after a period of mourning.

<text>is a Japanese radio station in Tokyo which broadcasts to the Kanto area. It is one of the two flagship radio stations of National Radio Network (NRN) (the other station is ) and is a member of the Fujisankei Communications Group.

==History==
The station was established in 1951 by the Society of St. Paul to promote Catholic religion on the Japanese culture. JOQR went on the air on March 31, 1952 as the Japan Cultural Broadcasting Association. The station initially broadcast on 1310kc (10 kW output) but moved to 1130kc (former frequency of TBS Radio) on August 15, 1953 in order for the Nippon Broadcasting System to use JOQR&#x27;s former frequency.

At the time of its opening, the mission was to &quot;improve Japanese culture, spread the ideals of truth, goodness, justice, and a sound democratic ideology based on humanity , and contribute to the rise of the nation and the prosperity of the people&quot;. However, due to self-righteous management by Priest Paolo Marcelino of the Sisters of St. Paul, who was in charge, and the hiring of a large number of employees who had been red-purged from NHK at the time of its opening, labor disputes occurred frequently, and religious overtones occurred. The company&#x27;s business conditions deteriorated and its representatives changed frequently due to concerns from those around it, low audience ratings due to a lack of entertainment programs, a narrow broadcasting area due to low output, and a lack of emphasis on profit. There were also rumors that the content of the broadcast was biased to the extent that it was said to be &quot;a broadcast aimed at communist Japan&quot;, and that it was &quot;taken over by the left-leaning and anti-American Japan Labor Union General Council (Sohyo)&quot;.

The business world, feeling a sense of crisis, decided to take countermeasures in cooperation with publishers such as Obunsha and Kodansha, as well as companies from all over the world, and as a result, the Sisters of St. Paul and the Sisters of St. Paul were forced to withdraw from the management of the station. As a result, the Japan Cultural Broadcasting Corporation was formally dissolved on February 16, 1956. However, since the Sisters of St. Paul had invested in equipment such as the company building and transmitting station at the time, they were given matching shares, and are now the largest shareholder of the Nippon Cultural Broadcasting Co., Ltd., and have sent one director to the company.

In 1957, Cultural Broadcasting established Fuji Television as part of a joint venture with Nippon Broadcasting System. Cultural Broadcasting was one of the founding companies behind the creation of the Fujisankei Communications Group in 1967. To this day, Cultural Broadcasting remains associated with the Fujisankei Communications Group and has a 3.30% ownership in Fuji Media Holdings, the company it helped established with Nippon Broadcasting System in 1957 as Fuji Television.

JOQR moved the head office from Wakaba, Shinjuku to QR Media Plus in Hamamatsuchō, Minato on July 24, 2006, and started broadcasting from Hamamatsuchō at 13:00 on the same day.

Society of St. Paul holds 30 percent of the station&#x27;s shares, followed by Shogakukan (17.1%), Kodansha (9.0%) and Dai Nippon Printing (8.5%).

As for future plans, in order to eliminate the burden of equipment renewal costs due to slumping advertising revenue and double investment with Wide FM, JOQR will work with 43 commercial broadcasters that provide AM broadcasting nationwide, excluding Hokkaido and Akita, to shift to FM broadcasting, announced on June 15, 2021. Subsequently, in a press release issued on June 24 of the same year, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting stated that it would not participate in the demonstration experiment to be conducted from 2024 regarding AM suspension, and that it would not be able to continue AM broadcasting at the time of license renewal in the fall of 2028. The plan is to decide whether to continue as usual or quit (switch to FM broadcasting).

==Headquarters==
It is headquartered at QR Media Plus - 31, Hamamatsuchō 1-chōme, Minato, Tokyo, Japan.

<doc id="1336308" wikidata="Q192115" url="?curid=1336308" title="Sin City (film)">
<text>Sin City (also known as Frank Miller&#x27;s Sin City) is a 2005 American neo-noir action crime anthology film directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller based on Miller&#x27;s comic book series of the same name. The film stars an ensemble cast led by Jessica Alba, Benicio del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Elijah Wood, and featuring Alexis Bledel, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Carla Gugino, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, and Makenzie Vega among others.

Much of the film is based on the first, third, and fourth books in Miller&#x27;s original comic series. &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot; is about an ex-convict who embarks on a rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart&#x27;s killer. &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot; follows a private investigator who gets caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police, and the mob. &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot; focuses on an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured serial killer. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story &quot;The Customer is Always Right&quot; which is collected in &quot;Booze, Broads &amp; Bullets&quot;, the sixth book in the comic series.

&quot;Sin City&quot; opened to critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film&#x27;s unique color processing which rendered most of the film in black and white while retaining or adding color for selected objects. The film was screened at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival in competition and won the Technical Grand Prize for the film&#x27;s &quot;visual shaping&quot;. A sequel also directed by Miller and Rodriguez was released in 2014, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, but failed to match the success of its predecessor.

== Plot ==

===&quot;The Customer Is Always Right (Part I)&quot;===
The Salesman walks onto a penthouse balcony where The Customer looks out over Basin City. He offers her a cigarette and says that she looks like someone who is tired of running and that he will save her. The two share a kiss and he shoots her; she dies in his arms. He says he will never know what she was running from but that he will cash her check in the morning. 

===&quot;That Yellow Bastard (Part I)&quot;===
On the docks of Sin City, aging police officer John Hartigan tries to stop serial child-killer Roark Junior from raping and killing his fourth known victim, eleven-year-old Nancy Callahan. Junior is the son of the corrupt and powerful Senator Roark, who has bribed Hartigan&#x27;s corrupt partner, Bob, to cover up his son&#x27;s crimes. Bob tries to persuade Hartigan to walk away; Hartigan knocks him out.

Hartigan, fighting pain from a bad heart, heads into the warehouse where Roark Junior is holding Nancy. After defeating his accomplices, Hartigan confronts Junior and shoots off his ear, hand and genitals. Bob, now recovered, arrives and shoots Hartigan in the back. As the sirens approach, Bob leaves and Nancy lies down in Hartigan&#x27;s lap. Hartigan passes out, reasoning his death is a fair trade for the girl&#x27;s life.

===&quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;===
After a one-night stand with a woman named Goldie, Marv awakens to find she has been killed while he slept. He flees the frame-up as the police arrive, vowing to avenge her death. His lesbian parole officer, Lucille, advises him to give up, for Marv may have imagined it all due to his &quot;condition&quot;. Marv interrogates several informants, working up to a corrupt priest, who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. Marv kills the priest. As he leaves, Marv is attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie, which he dismisses as a hallucination.

Marv goes to the Roark family farm and is subdued by the silent stalker who killed Goldie. He awakens in the basement to find Lucille has been captured after looking into his story. She tells Marv that the killer is a cannibal named Kevin and that Goldie was a prostitute. They escape the basement, but Lucille is shot by a squad of corrupt cops. Marv kills the cops except for their leader, who reveals Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie&#x27;s murder.

Marv goes to Old Town, Sin City&#x27;s prostitute-run red-light district, to learn more about Goldie and is captured by her twin sister, Wendy. Once he convinces Wendy that he is not the killer, the two return to the farm where Marv traps and kills Kevin. He confronts Cardinal Roark, who confesses his part in the murders. Kevin was the cardinal&#x27;s ward; the two men ate the prostitutes to &quot;consume their souls&quot;. Marv kills the cardinal. He is then shot and captured by his guards.

Marv is nursed back to health. Corrupt cops threaten to kill his mother to get him to confess to killing Roark, Kevin and their victims. He is sentenced to death in the electric chair. Wendy visits him on death row and thanks him for avenging her sister. Marv is then executed.

===&quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;===
Shellie is being harassed by her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy. Her boyfriend Dwight McCarthy violently warns him to leave Shellie alone. Jackie Boy and his cronies drunkenly drive to Old Town. Dwight follows and sees them harass Becky, a young prostitute. Gail, the prostitutes&#x27; leader and Dwight&#x27;s on-and-off lover, also witnesses the scene. When Jackie Boy threatens Becky with a gun, Miho, a martial arts expert, kills Jackie Boy and his friends. They realize Jackie Boy is actually Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty of the Basin City Police, considered a &quot;hero cop&quot; by the press. If the cops learn how he died, their truce with the prostitutes would end and the mob would be free to wage war on Old Town.

Dwight takes the bodies to a tar pit, where he is ambushed by an ex-IRA mercenary hired by mob boss Wallenquist. He nearly drowns in the tar before Miho saves him. The mercenary flees to the sewer with Jackie Boy&#x27;s severed head but Dwight and Miho retrieve it and return to Old Town. Meanwhile, mob enforcer Manute kidnaps Gail. Becky, threatened with the death of her mother, betrays the prostitutes. Manute prepares the mob&#x27;s invasion of Old Town. Dwight trades Jackie Boy&#x27;s head for Gail&#x27;s freedom but the head is stuffed with explosives; Dwight detonates it, destroying the evidence and Gail&#x27;s captors. The other prostitutes gun down the mercenaries while Becky, injured in the fight, escapes.

===&quot;That Yellow Bastard (Part II)&quot;===
Hartigan is recovering in a hospital when Senator Roark informs him that Junior is in a coma and the Roark legacy is in serious jeopardy. Hartigan will be framed for Junior&#x27;s crimes; if he tells anyone the truth, his family will die. A grateful Nancy promises to write to him every week. Hartigan goes to jail, though he refuses to confess. He receives weekly letters from Nancy, as promised. After eight years, the letters stop and he receives a severed finger instead. Hartigan confesses to all charges, leading to his parole. He searches for an adult Nancy, not knowing he is being followed by a deformed, yellow man. He eventually finds her at Kadie&#x27;s Bar, where she has become an exotic dancer.

Hartigan realizes he was set up to lead &quot;them&quot; to Nancy and the two drive away in her car, followed by the deformed man. As they hide in a motel, Nancy confesses her love for Hartigan, who is unable to reciprocate her feelings. The deformed man ambushes Hartigan and reveals himself as Roark Junior, disfigured by years of treatment to regenerate his body parts. Junior hangs Hartigan and takes Nancy away. Hartigan escapes and tracks down Junior to the Roark farm. He fakes a heart attack, causing Junior to lower his guard. He castrates Junior a second time and brutally beats him to death. He sends Nancy away in her car, promising to join her soon. Knowing that Senator Roark will never stop hunting them, Hartigan commits suicide to ensure Nancy&#x27;s safety.

===&quot;The Customer Is Always Right (Part II)&quot;===
An injured Becky departs from a hospital, talking on a cell phone with her mother. In the elevator she encounters The Salesman, dressed as a doctor. He offers her a cigarette, calling her by name, and she abruptly ends the call with her mother.

== Cast ==

Frank Miller makes a cameo appearance as a priest, while Robert Rodriguez makes a cameo appearance as a member of the SWAT team.

== Production ==
=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on March 29, 2004. Several of the scenes were shot before any actor had signed on; as a result, several stand-ins were used before the actual actors were digitally added into the film during post-production. Rodriguez, an aficionado of cinematic technology, has used similar techniques in the past. In Roger Ebert&#x27;s review of the film, he recalled Rodriguez&#x27;s speech during production of &quot;Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams&quot;: &quot;This is the future! You don&#x27;t wait six hours for a scene to be lighted. You want a light over here, you grab a light and put it over here. You want a nuclear submarine, you make one out of thin air and put your characters into it.&quot;

The film was noted throughout production for Rodriguez&#x27;s plan to stay faithful to the source material, unlike most other comic book adaptations. Rodriguez stated that he considered the film to be &quot;less of an adaptation than a translation&quot;. As a result, there is no screenwriting in the credits; simply &quot;Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller&quot;. There were several minor changes, such as dialogue trimming, new colorized objects, removal of some nudity, slightly edited violence, and minor deleted scenes. These scenes were later added in the release of the &quot;Sin City&quot; Collectors DVD, which also split the books into four separate stories.

=== Music ===

The soundtrack was composed by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell. The film&#x27;s three main stories were each scored by an individual composer: Revell scored &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;, Debney scored &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;, and Rodriguez scored &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot;. Additionally, Rodriguez co-scored with the other two composers on several tracks.

Another notable piece of music used was the instrumental version of the song &quot;Cells&quot; by the London-based alternative group The Servant. The song was heavily featured in the film&#x27;s publicity, including the promotional trailers and television spots, and being featured on the film&#x27;s DVD menus.

&quot;Sensemayá&quot; by Silvestre Revueltas is also used on the end sequence of &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot;. Fluke&#x27;s track &quot;Absurd&quot; is also used when Hartigan first enters Kadie&#x27;s.

=== Credits ===
Three directors received credit for &quot;Sin City&quot;: Miller, Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino, the last for directing the drive-to-the-pits scene in which Dwight talks with a dead Jack Rafferty (Benicio del Toro). Miller and Rodriguez worked as a team directing the rest of the film.

When the Directors Guild of America refused to allow two directors that were not an established team to be credited (especially since Miller had never directed before), Rodriguez first planned to give Miller full credit. Miller would not accept this. Rodriguez, also refusing to take full credit, decided to resign from the Guild so that the joint credit could remain.

== Release ==
===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and VHS on August 16, 2005. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released a two-disc Blu-ray version with DTS-HD Master Audio, which includes a theatrical and extended, unrated, recut of 147 minutes, on April 21, 2009.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Sin City&quot; opened on April 1, 2005, to generally positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 257 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Visually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, &quot;Sin City&quot; brings the dark world of Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novel to vivid life.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 74 (citing &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;) based on 40 reviews. A 2017 data analysis of Metacritic reviews by Gizmodo UK found &quot;Sin City&quot; to be the third most critically divisive film of recent years. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, describing it as &quot;a visualization of the pulp noir imagination, uncompromising and extreme. Yes, and brilliant.&quot; Online critical reaction was particularly strong: James Berardinelli placed the film on his list of the &quot;Top Ten&quot; films of 2005. Chauncey Mabe of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; wrote: &quot;Really, there will be no reason for anyone to make a comic-book film ever again. Miller and Rodriguez have pushed the form as far as it can possibly go.&quot;

Some reviews focused predominantly on the film&#x27;s more graphic content, criticizing it for a lack of &quot;humanity&quot;, the overwhelmingly dominant themes of violence against women, typically of an exploitative or sexualized nature. William Arnold of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; described it as a celebration of &quot;helpless people being tortured&quot; and &quot;a disturbing gorefest&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Manohla Dargis gave credit for Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences&quot;, but noted that &quot;it&#x27;s a shame the movie is kind of a bore&quot; because the director&#x27;s vision seems to prevail on the intensity of reading a graphic novel.

In a more lighthearted piece focusing on the progression of films and the origins of &quot;Sin City&quot;, fellow &quot;Times&quot; critic A. O. Scott, identifying &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; as its chief cinematic predecessor, argued that &quot;Something is missing – something human. Don&#x27;t let the movies fool you: Roger Rabbit was guilty,&quot; with regard to the increasing use of digitisation within films to replace the human elements. He applauds the fact Rodriguez &quot;has rendered a gorgeous world of silvery shadows that updates the expressionist cinematography of postwar noir&quot; but bemoans that several elements of &quot;old film noirs has been digitally broomed away&quot;, resulting instead in a film that &quot;offers sensation without feeling, death without grief, sin without guilt, and, ultimately, novelty without surprise&quot;.

&quot;Sin City&quot; is described as a neo-noir film by some authors.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Sin City&quot; grossed $29.1 million on its opening weekend in first place, defeating fellow opener &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; by more than twice its opening take. The film saw a sharp decline in its second weekend, dropping over 50%. Ultimately, the film ended its North American run with a gross of $74.1 million against its $40 million negative cost. Overseas, the film grossed $84.6 million, for a worldwide total from theater receipts of $158.7 million.

=== Accolades ===
Mickey Rourke won a Saturn Award, an Online Film Critics Society Award, a Chicago Film Critics Association Award, and an Irish Film &amp; Television Award for his performance. The film also won the Saturn Awards for Best Action Film and Best DVD Special Edition Release. It was also in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, and Rodriguez won the Technical Grand Prize for the film&#x27;s visual shaping. Graeme Revell&#x27;s work in the film was honored with a Best Film Music Award at the BMI Film &amp; TV Awards.

&quot;Sin City&quot; was nominated at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards in three categories: Best Movie, Best Kiss for Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson, and Sexiest Performance for Jessica Alba, winning the latter. The film also received three nominations at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards: Choice Action Movie, Choice Action Movie Actress for Jessica Alba and Choice Movie Villain for Elijah Wood.

== Sequel ==

A sequel, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;, was released on August 22, 2014. Production for the sequel began in October 2012 with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller directing a script co-written by them and William Monahan. The film was based mainly on &quot;A Dame to Kill For&quot;, the second book in the &quot;Sin City&quot; series by Miller, and also included the short story &quot;Just Another Saturday Night&quot; from the &quot;Booze, Broads, &amp; Bullets&quot; collection, as well as two original stories written by Miller for the film, titled &quot;The Long Bad Night&quot; and &quot;Nancy&#x27;s Last Dance&quot;. Actors Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all reprised their roles in the sequel, amongst others. Unlike the 2005 original, the sequel was a critical and financial failure.

== TV series ==
In 2017, news outlets reported that Dimension Films was developing a soft reboot of the series for television. Stephen L&#x27;Heureux, who produced the second film, would have overseen the series with &quot;Sin City&quot; creator Frank Miller. It would be with new characters and timelines and be more like the comics rather than the films. In November 2019, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Legendary Pictures bought the rights for the television series and are developing both a live action and animated series of &quot;Sin City&quot; with both Miller and Rodriguez in talks to work on the series as executive producers.

<text>ABC Newcastle (call sign: 2NC) is an Australian radio station. It is the Newcastle station of the ABC local radio network, and is licensed to, and serving Newcastle and surrounding areas. It operates on the AM band at 1233 kilohertz. Formerly known by its callsign 2NC, the NC in the callsign is short for Newcastle, while the 2 represents the state of New South Wales. The station was established in 1930.

==History==
2NC was the very first regional radio station in Australia outside a capital city. It was set up by Adrian Jose. The first broadcast occurred 19 December 1930, and played the Newcastle Symphony Orchestra playing the William Tell Overture. James Fenton acting as the prime minister of Australia gave a speech. Local Newcastle content was limited to an hour a week and included news, market reports and church services. The station was heard in New Zealand. Its original frequency was 1245 kHz or wavelength of 241 metres. The power was 2 kW with a modulation of 85%. The transmitting equipment was established by Keith Thow of STC. The transmitting antenna is at Beresfield. It was designed to have a range of 25 miles, covering a population of 200,000.

In 1931 2YB in New Plymouth, New Zealand was interfering with 2NC causing a heterodyne whistle.

Other early local content included the Newcastle Steel Works Band, the Newcastle Choral Society and the Newcastle Revellers.

For a time in the early 2000s, the ABC Newcastle website included a 5-day-a-week 5-minute TV news bulletin dedicated to Newcastle, shot in the ABC NSW studio.

The first studios were located behind the Old Strand Theatre on Market Street, before moving to 24 Wood Street.

==Programs==
Its programs are also heard on ABC Upper Hunter, the ABC&#x27;s station serving the Upper Hunter.

==Sports coverage==
In addition to Grandstand&#x27;s national coverage, ABC Newcastle and ABC Upper Hunter also broadcast Newcastle Knights rugby league and Newcastle Jets football games as well.

<doc id="1336323" wikidata="Q1468073" url="?curid=1336323" title="Oină">
<text>Oină () is a Romanian traditional bat-and-ball game, similar in many ways to baseball.

==History==
The name &quot;oină&quot; was originally &quot;hoina&quot;, and is derived from the Cuman word &quot;oyn&quot; &quot;game&quot; (a cognate of the Turkish &quot;&quot;).

The oldest direct mention comes from a diet manual of 1782 by medic István Mátyus, who talks about the health benefits of oina. However, it may have been attested as early as in 1364, during the reign of Vladislav, the Wallachian voivode. 

In 1899, Spiru Haret, the Romanian minister of education, decided that oină was to be played in schools in physical education classes. He organized the first annual oină competitions.

The Romanian Oină Federation (&quot;&quot;Federaţia Română de Oină&quot;) was founded in 1932 and was reactivated at the beginning of the 1950s, after a brief period when it was dissolved.

Today, there are two oină federations: one in Bucharest, Romania and another one in Chișinău, Moldova.

In recent years the Romanian oină Federation has launched a wide campaign to revive this kind of sport. Most of the traditional centres have been restored, and new areas have also been incorporated, so oină is practiced in more than 40 regions at the moment.

In addition to spreading oină in the regions of Romania, the Romanian oină Federation actively popularizes this game outside the country organizing demonstration tournaments in different countries (Serbia, Japan, Indonesia, England, Poland, Germany, India, Pakistan, Croatia, Ukraine). For internationalization, the Federation establishes partnerships with institutions outside the country (as it was in Ukraine, India, Pakistan and England) or with people who want to help popularize this kind of sport. In cooperation with these people and institutions, the FRO creates study guides and handbooks on oină in various foreign languages.

==Pitch==

The pitch is a rectangle, long by wide divided into:

* the in game (&quot;în joc&quot;) area, which is 
* the batting zone (&quot;zona de bătaie&quot;) – long – delimited from the in game area by the batting line
* the back zone (&quot;zona de fund&quot;) – a long safe zone during a run – delimited from the in game area by the back line

The attacking side player that has commenced a run will have to cross the following four lines in order:

* the start line (the left side of the batting line)
* the arrival line (the left side of the back line)
* the return line (the right side of the back line)
* the escape line (the right side of the batting line)

The in-game area is further split into the advance and return triangles and squares. At the intersection of the lines inside the game area and the pitch limits or other lines within the game area, there are circles which determine the positions of the midfielders (&quot;mijlocași&quot;) and side players (&quot;mărginași&quot;&quot;). The 1m and 3m semicircles are used for batting and serving. A waiting line is drawn for attacking players to wait their turn to bat.

==Players==

There are two teams of 11 players, one attacking side or &quot;at bat&quot; (&quot;la bătaie&quot;) and one defending side or &quot;at catch&quot; (&quot;&quot;la prindere&quot;). The roles switch at half time.

The defending players are placed in the following positions:

* 3 midfielders (&quot;mijlocași&quot;)
* 3 advance side players (&quot;mărginași de ducere&quot;)
* 3 return side players (&quot;mărginași de întoarcere&quot;)
* 1 back player (&quot;fundaș&quot;) that is free to move within the back zone
* 1 forward player (&quot;fruntaș&quot;) that is free to move within the batting zone

The attacking players change roles as the game progresses. The roles are chronologically ordered this way:

* waiting one&#x27;s turn
* serving the ball
* batting
* waiting to enter the game (make a run)
* running the advance corridor
* staying in the back zone
* running the return corridor

Each team has a captain (&quot;căpitan&quot; or &quot;baci&quot;&quot;&quot;). The midfielder 2 is usually used as captain because he can throw the ball at an attacking player in any game position. For this reason, the midfielder 2 is also known as a &quot;baci&quot;.

Each team has a maximum of 5 substitutes available.

==Scope of the game==
The teams have very different roles depending on whether they are at bat or at catch. At bat players are tasked to open a play and run the lanes until they cross the escape line. At catch players are tasked to hit the players running the lanes with the ball. There can be a maximum of two players running each lane at the same time. A player can be hit in both lanes once.

==Rules==
The team at bat is selected by a ritual where the players have to grab the bat, thrown by the referee, and the last one to be able to place at least four fingers on the bat wins. The game begins with the team at bat, with one of the players throwing the ball while another player of the same team has to hit it with a wooden bat (&quot;&quot;bâtă&quot;) and send it as far as he can towards the adversary field. After that, if the ball is caught by the adversaries, the player can run (if he wishes, or if he is forced to run by the referee) the advance and return corridors/lanes (&quot;culoarele de ducere și întoarcere&quot;), without being hit by the defenders. If he stops the ball with his palm, it is not considered a hit. The player is not allowed to catch the ball, and he must release it immediately. If the player doing a run is hit he goes out of field and into the back zone, or he finishes his tasks, depending on which lane he is running.

The full set of regulations can be found here.

==Scoring==
===In game===
At catch players score two points for each player hit with a ball, unless the ball touches the palm or the back of the palm.

At bat players score by batting beyond certain lines, like so:
* the ball crosses the 65m line in the air and does not go out of bounds (does not cross the lateral lines), whether or not the defense touches the ball in the air – 2 points
* the ball falls in the back zone – 2 points
* the ball is touched in the air by the defense, and goes out of bounds in the air from within the back zone – 2 points
* the ball goes out of bounds in the air from within the back zone without being touched by the defense – 1 point
* the ball crosses the 60m line (the back line) in the air and is caught by the defense – 1 point
* the ball crosses the threequarters line in the air and falls in the threequarters area – 1 point
* the ball goes out of bounds in the air from within the threequarters area – 1 point
* the ball is diverted out of bounds in the air from within the threequartees area by the defense – 1 point
* the ball falls on the threequarters area of the back line – 1 point
* the ball is diverted from within the threequarters area in front of the threequarters line by the defense and is not subsequently caught in the air – 1 point

===Competition===
Winning brings the team 3 points, a draw brings in 2 points, and the losing team will score 1 point. Quitting or elimination of the team will result in no points being awarded and a 0–9 loss. Running out of substitutes due to injuries will result in a 0–6 loss and 1 point being awarded, while if the same situation is due to the elimination of a player, the result will be a 0–9 loss and no points being awarded.

==Ball==
A spherical ball made of leather, filled with horse, pig, or bovine hair is used in oină. The ball is around in diameter and in senior games and around in diameter and in U-18 games.

==Comparison with baseball==
* Similar weight of the ball: around for both
* Longer and slimmer bat for oină
* A game takes only 30 minutes for oină
* Oină teams have 11 players, baseball teams have 9 players
* In oină, the defense can score by hitting the attacking players that are in game (running the lanes)

==Competitions in Romania==
All competitions are organized by the governing body, the Romanian Oină Federation (&quot;Federaţia Română de Oină&quot;&quot; – FRO).

The main competitions are:
* The National Championship
* The Romanian Cup
* The Romanian Supercup
* The National Junior Championship

Other competitions in 2010 are:
* &quot;Dragu&quot; Cup
* &quot;Gherăești&quot; Cup
* &quot;Antena Satelor&quot; National Championship (junior)

==Internationalizing Oină==
Oină and variants of the sport are also played in neighboring countries where there has been or still is a Romanian ethnic or cultural presence. As part of its program to bring oină to the spotlight again, the FRO has begun the process of creating an international federation. A minimum of three national federations need to exist in order to form an international federation, and two exist already (the Romanian and Moldovan federations). The FRO has begun talks of founding oină clubs and federations in neighboring Bulgaria and Serbia, and in Sweden. Demonstration matches are to be held in Serbia.

<text>Fortuna Sittard (; ) is a professional football club from the municipality of Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands. The club currently plays its football in the 12,500 capacity Fortuna Sittard Stadion and features in the Eredivisie. The club was established through a merger of former clubs Fortuna 54 and Sittardia, which merged as the Fortuna Sittardia Combinatie on 1 July 1968.

== History ==

The club experienced mixed fortunes throughout its history, although it was a regular fixture in the Eredivisie in the 1990s, with players such as Kevin Hofland, Mark van Bommel and Fernando Ricksen emerging from its youth system. These players later joined PSV Eindhoven and Rangers and played for the Netherlands national team. The team also signed Wilfred Bouma and Patrick Paauwe from the youth setup of PSV. Both players developed under manager Bert van Marwijk before joining the Dutch national side and moving to bigger clubs.

Fortuna 54 won the KNVB Cup in the 1956–57 season and finished the Eredivisie season in second place behind champions Ajax. Sittardia were less successful and battled against relegation for many seasons. Fortuna 54 won the KNVB Cup again in 1964 before the merging of the two clubs in 1968, due to financial difficulties.

At the end of the 1999–2000 season, manager Bert van Marwijk left to join Feyenoord, and the team was relegated to the Eerste Divisie in the 2001–02 season.

===Financial difficulties (2002–16)===
Financial irregularities were discovered, and the team faced bankruptcy over several seasons. In the winter of 2003, two of the club&#x27;s fans won the Dutch lottery and donated all of the prize money to the club. The club cleared most of its debts by selling off its new stadium, the Wagner &amp; Partners stadium.

On 19 May 2009, the KNVB announced it would withdraw the club&#x27;s license to play for the 2010–11 season. After going to civil court, this decision was revoked. Despite ongoing financial difficulties, the club gradually began to recover financially in the following years, leading to improved results. In the 2011–12 season, Fortuna Sittard narrowly missed out on qualifying for the playoffs for promotion to Eredivisie, conceding an equaliser in the final seconds of the season in a home match against the Go Ahead Eagles, resulting in the Eagles taking the final playoff spot instead. Although the club qualified for the playoffs in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons, offering them a chance to return to Eredivisie since relegation in 2002, Fortuna was unsuccessful in both first-round matches against De Graafschap.

===Takeover and Eredivisie (2016–present)===
The club again faced financial troubles in 2016, leading to its takeover by Turkish investor Işıtan Gün, who previously served as the chief operating officer of Galatasaray. The 2016–17 season was a tough start for the club, but it managed to avoid relegation after changing coaches and recruiting new players, including some from Galatasaray.

In December 2016, Sunday Oliseh was appointed as the new coach of Fortuna Sittard. During his time as coach, he set two new records for the club, with eight consecutive home victories and the biggest away victory in the club&#x27;s history, against Telstar by a score of 6–0. In January 2018, the team won a &quot;periodetitel&quot; after a 2–1 victory over Jong Ajax. However, on 14 February 2018, Oliseh was suspended due to &quot;repeated and culpable actions towards multiple individuals within the organisation over an extended period,&quot; according to a statement on the club&#x27;s website announcing his release. Oliseh posted online that he was suspended due to his &quot;refusal to participate in Illegal activities.&quot;

In 2018, after 16 years in the Eerste Divisie, Fortuna won promotion to the Eredivisie again after beating Jong PSV 1–0 to stay clear from NEC and finishing runner-up to champions Jong Ajax, which cannot be promoted.

Fortuna Sittard finished in 16th place during the 2019–20 season. However, because the season was suspended and declared void due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the club remained in the Eredivisie for the 2020–21 season. After that reprieve, the club finished in 11th place that season. The following year, Fortuna Sittard finished 15th, just one point clear of the relegation playoff. Since then, the club&#x27;s results have placed it more comfortably in the mid-table. Fortuna Sittard finished in 13th place in the 2022–23 season and 10th place in the 2023–24 season.

In its first season, the club finished third out of 11 teams. In the 2023–24 season, Fortuna finished in fourth place out of 12 teams, and forward Tessa Wullaert was the top goal scorer and Player of the Year. However, prior to the 2024–25 season, the club announced it had not generated sufficient revenue from the women&#x27;s team and cut its player spending, with Wullaert, Alieke Tuin, and other players departing for new clubs.

<text>Theodor Gomperz (March 29, 1832August 29, 1912), Austrian philosopher and classical scholar, was born at Brno (Brünn).

==Biography==
Gomperz studied at Brno and at Vienna under Hermann Bonitz. Graduating at the University of Vienna in 1867 he became &quot;privatdozent&quot;, and subsequently a professor of classical philology (1873). In 1882 he was elected a full member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. He received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Königsberg, and Doctor of Literature from the universities of Dublin and Cambridge, and became correspondent for several learned societies.

Gomperz resigned his professorship at Vienna in order to devote all his energy to his magnum opus &quot;Griechische Denker&quot; (&quot;Greek Thinkers&quot;), which first appeared in 1893.

He died in Baden bei Wien.

<text>The Uganda Electoral Commission (EC) provides national elections for a president and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term. The Parliament is composed of members directly elected to represent constituencies, and one woman representative for every district; as well representatives of special interest groups, including the army, youth, workers and persons with disabilities.

==Overview==
The first national election in Uganda was the Uganda National Assembly election of 1962. An alliance between the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) and Kabaka Yekka (KY) won the majority of parliamentary seats, and formed Uganda&#x27;s first post-independence government with Obote as executive Prime Minister.

A period of dictatorship and political strife, including the tenures of Idi Amin, Yusuf Lule and Godfrey Binaisa, meant no elections were held until the presidential election of December 1980. Obote was pronounced the winner amid bitter dispute and allegations of electoral fraud. Yoweri Museveni, one of the presidential aspirants, declared an armed rebellion, and waged a guerrilla war (the Ugandan Bush War) against the government of Obote. Museveni&#x27;s National Resistance Army (NRA) took power in 1986 from the government of Gen. Tito Okello Lutwa who had six months earlier toppled Obote&#x27;s UPC government in a July 27, 1985 military coup, making him president.

Museveni and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) created a form of &quot;no-party democracy&quot;, banning political parties from fielding candidates directly in elections. In the &quot;no-party&quot; presidential election in 1996, Museveni defeated Paul Ssemogerere and Mohamed Mayanja by a landslide. Although international and domestic observers described the vote as valid, both the losing candidates rejected the results. In the following presidential election, held in 2001, Museveni won by a substantial majority, with Kizza Besigye as the only real challenger. Despite a protest against the results, citing massive voter intimidation and rigging, the outcome was accepted by the Supreme Court of Uganda.

In the 2005 constitutional referendum, Ugandans voted to restore a multi-party political system, lifting the 19-year restriction on the activities of political parties. The 2006 general election was the first multiparty election in 25 years. Museveni won 59% of the presidential vote, and his party, the National Resistance Movement, won the majority of parliamentary seats. Pop star and opposition leader with Bobi Wine challenged Museveni for the presidency in the 2021 election, with Museveni winning.

<text>ABC Upper Hunter (call sign: 2UH) is an Australian radio station. It is the Upper Hunter service of the ABC Local Radio network, and serves Muswellbrook and surrounding areas.

==History==

ABC Upper Hunter commenced as a local relay of Newcastle&#x27;s 2NC (now ABC Newcastle) in 1964. While there was some local information on the station, the reporter responsible was based in Newcastle. It wasn&#x27;t until 1990 when a local office of the ABC was established in the Upper Hunter, basing itself in Market Lane Muswellbrook. Mike Pritchard joined the broadcaster from the &quot;Scone Advocate&quot; newspaper, and was the station&#x27;s rural reporter until his retirement in 2021, even acting as the lone employee in the region on occasion. In 1997, the station moved to its current facilities in Brook Street.

Throughout 2009, the station&#x27;s programming went on hiatus while the studios were upgraded with digital equipment. Rural programming came from ABC New England North West, while local news and other programming continued to originate from ABC Newcastle. Regular programming resumed mid-year once the upgrade was complete.

==Frequencies==

ABC Upper Hunter transmits on both the AM and FM bands from four transmitter sites in the Upper Hunter.

The main AM signal, with the callsign 2UH (as in Upper Hunter), operates on 1044 kHz, and reaches most of the Upper Hunter. This signal is transmitted from the Broadcast Australia site on Sandy Creek Road just outside Muswellbrook.

The station relays its programs on the FM band from three transmitter sites, all using the callsign 2HVR (as in Hunter Valley Radio).

==Programming==

The station produces a daily breakfast program between 6:30am and 8:00am weekdays, with local news bulletins at 6:30am and 7:30am. Supplementary news bulletins are provided by ABC Newcastle until 9am.

The bureau&#x27;s rural reporter also co-produces the daily Upper Hunter New England North West Rural Report with ABC New England North West&#x27;s rural reporter, which airs from 6:15am to 6:30am weekdays.

The station broadcasts ABC Newcastle&#x27;s Mornings and Drive programs, but diverts at midday to broadcast &quot;The Country Hour&quot;, followed by &quot;The World Today&quot; on a one-hour delay at 1.00pm.

In mid-2009, the station broadcast an hour-long program called &quot;Upper Hunter Weekend&quot;, which previewed events in the Upper Hunter for the coming weekend. It was hosted by Silas Moss and Niav Owens. The station now broadcasts ABC Newcastle&#x27;s Saturday Breakfast program, hosted by Craig Hamilton, between 6am and midday.

In 2021, ABC Upper Hunter commenced streaming capabilities via a podcast service on its website.

The Radio National program &quot;Late Night Live&quot; occasionally broadcasts from these studios, as presenter Phillip Adams and his partner Patrice Newell own an organic farm in the area.

<text>Jonathan Drummond-Webb (29 August 1959 – 26 December 2004) was a South African pediatric heart surgeon.

He gained national attention by way of a TV series produced by ABC News called &quot;ICU: Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, which showcased complicated operations during the summer of 2002. Late in 2004, he led a team that successfully kept a child alive with a newly developed heart pump until a heart transplant could be performed. The child, Travis Marcus, was able to go home in time for Christmas with a gift and a hug from Drummond-Webb.

Drummond-Webb was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1982. He completed an internship and two residencies there. He and his wife Lorraine De Blanche (also a doctor) came to the U.S. in 1993 so he could do a surgical fellowship at the University of Utah. Two years later, he went on to another fellowship at the Cleveland Clinic. There, he became the surgical director of pediatric cardiac and lung transplantation. In 2001, he was named chief of pediatric and congenital cardiac surgery at the Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. He held that post at the time of his death.

Hospital spokesman Tom Bonner said the surgeon was a competitive marathoner and triathlete who loved scuba diving. Drummond-Webb also was a champion of Arkansas, appearing in commercials promoting the state to businesses.

Drummond-Webb committed suicide by taking an overdose of oxycodone, a pain medication. His wife found his body with a note. According to the Arkansas Children&#x27;s Hospital, friends believed he suffered from a sudden bout of depression. His suicide note indicated professional frustration may have been a factor in his death.

<text>Matthews Ridge is a small village within the Barima-Waini administrative region of Guyana. The village name comes from the name of a public official, Matthew Young, as well as the ridges in the area. The village is divided into three sections, Heaven&#x27;s Hill, Hell Hill and the valley.

==Demographics &amp; Employment==

The population of Matthews Ridge as of 2012 is 409 people, and is composed mainly of Afro-Guyanese and Amerindian persons. Carib is the language spoken by the local Amerindian people.

Agriculture is also an important economic activity in Matthews Ridge, however to a lesser extent than mining.

==History==
Matthews Ridge was one of the oldest indigenous villages in the Barima-Waini region.
Between 1962 and 1968, Matthews Ridge was the location of a large manganese mining operation by Union Carbide. A narrow gauge railway was built to Port Kaituma to transport the ore. The mine was closed in 1968. In 2011, it has been reopened by Reunion Manganese Incorporated.

With the closing of the manganese mining operation in 1968, the village went into an economic downturn, which it struggled to recover from for many years. The mine was reopened by Canadian company Reunion Manganese Incorporated, but this operation was taken over by Guyana Manganese Incorporated (GMI) in 2019. Otherwise, small-scale gold mining is the basis for most other jobs in the area. This involves travel to backdams (small areas where gold is known to be located) by foot or on ATVs, where batels or dredges are used to mine.

==Education and health care==
The local nursery and primary schools can accommodate students through Grade 11. The school (Matthew&#x27;s Ridge Primary Tops School) had pupils sit CSEC for the first time in 2018, but it not yet recognised as a Secondary School meaning pupils sit exams in the nearby village of Port Kaituma.

Matthew&#x27;s Ridge has a health care centre, but as of 2017, it was lacking in facilities.

==Infrastructure==

The infrastructure of the village is elementary. Cell-phone service is available, through the Digicel mobile network. Electric current is available during certain hours of the day, provided by the town&#x27;s generator. Goods are brought into Matthews Ridge from Georgetown, and Port Kaituma. The village is served Matthews Ridge Airport. The village has a Pentecostal as well as Jehovah Witness church.

==Climate==
The area experiences an annual shift between rainy and dry seasons. Average temperature ranges between 80 and 100&#x27;F.

<text>Mabaruma is the administrative centre and regional capital for Region One (Barima-Waini) of Guyana. It is located close to the Aruka River (the Venezuelan border) on a narrow plateau above the surrounding rainforest at an elevation of 13 metres. 

==History==
Mabaruma was once a large estate owned by the Broomes family. Cocoa was one of the products manufactured before the Government of Guyana bought part of the land to build Governmental Institutions. Mainly Amerindians live in this area. Some of the tribes include Arawaks, Caribs and Warao. Mabaruma also has a large Afro-Guyanese population with small East Indian, Chinese and Portuguese communities.

It replaced Morawhanna as the regional capital after the former was deemed at risk from flooding. Mabaruma became a town in 2016 with the surrounding villages of Hosororo and Kumaka joining.

In 2023, amid the Guayana Esequiba diplomatic crisis, a group of Mabaruma citizens rallied in support of Guyana in the dispute. The event was attended by Minister of Housing and Water Collin Croal. The diplomatic crisis has reportedly led some Guyanese citizens to flee the town. 

==Overview==
There is a government guest house in the town as well as the Mabaruma Post Office, Mabaruma Hospital, and a police station where court cases are tried. Because of its size however, only petty crimes are tried.
Mabaruma contains the region&#x27;s first secondary school, North West Secondary School, established in 1965. Most local people either do farming or fishing work for a living.

==Climate==
Mabaruma has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round.

<doc id="1336379" wikidata="Q1757607" url="?curid=1336379" title="Straight Between the Eyes">
<text>Straight Between the Eyes is the sixth studio album by English rock band Rainbow, released in 1982 by Polydor Records. A remastered CD reissue, with packaging duplicating the original vinyl release, was released in May 1999. It was released on 14 April 1982 in the US by Mercury Records.

==History==
The album was the band&#x27;s first with keyboardist David Rosenthal replacing Don Airey. The remaining members were the same as on the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; album.

According to Blackmore, the title came from a meeting with Jeff Beck in 1967, when the two were discussing Jimi Hendrix. Beck told Blackmore that Hendrix&#x27;s guitar playing hit him &quot;straight between the eyes&quot;.

The sleeve-art is by British artist Jeff Cummins and Hipgnosis, though has been described as &quot;one of [Hipgnosis]&#x27; very worst; in fact, so bad, it taints the music.&quot; The original vinyl issue had the lyrics printed on the inner sleeve.

In an April 1982 interview with British rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Blackmore stated of &quot;MISS Mistreated&quot;, &quot;Well it&#x27;s to avoid confusion that the &#x27;Miss&#x27; is written three times bigger than the &#x27;mistreated&#x27; but I expect we&#x27;ll have someone who shall remain nameless coming up to us saying &#x27;I wrote that song&#x27;!&quot; That someone being David Coverdale, with whom Blackmore had co-written &quot;Mistreated&quot; for the 1974 Deep Purple album &quot;Burn&quot;. Blackmore had this issue with Coverdale previously when a rendition of &quot;Mistreated&quot; was included on the Rainbow live album &quot;On Stage&quot;.

Videos were shot for the songs &quot;Stone Cold&quot; and &quot;Death Alley Driver&quot;, the latter featuring Sega&#x27;s video game &quot;Turbo&quot;. Both videos received heavy play on MTV and were later included on Rainbow&#x27;s &quot;The Final Cut&quot; home video in 1985.

==Tour==
The tour featured a giant pair of moving mechanical eyes as part of the stageset, with spotlights shining from the pupils. This is captured on the video release &quot;Live Between the Eyes&quot; recorded at the Hemisfair Arena in San Antonio, Texas on August 18, 1982. The tour, although extensive, did not include the UK, which rankled with British fans.

==Accolades==
In 2022, &quot;Straight Between the Eyes&quot; was named #5 of &#x27;The 25 greatest rock guitar albums of 1982&#x27; list in Guitar World.

<doc id="1336395" wikidata="Q332923" url="?curid=1336395" title="William Russell, Lord Russell">
<text>William Russell, Lord Russell (29 September 163921 July 1683) was an English Country Party politician and nobleman. He was a leading member of the Country Party, forerunners of the Whigs, who during the reign of Charles II of England laid the groundwork for opposition in the English House of Commons to the accession of an openly Catholic monarch in Charles&#x27;s brother James. This ultimately resulted in Russell&#x27;s execution for treason, almost two years before Charles died and James acceded to the throne.

==Early life and marriage==
Born Hon. William Russell, he was the third son of William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford, later created Duke of Bedford, and Lady Anne Carr. After the death of his elder brother Francis, he gained the courtesy title of Baron Russell and was thus referred to as Lord Russell.

He and Francis were at Cambridge University in 1654. They then travelled abroad, visiting Lyon and Geneva, residing for a time at Augsburg. Russell&#x27;s account makes for a colourful depiction of his travels. The two made their way to Paris by 1658, and had returned to Woburn Abbey, Woburn (which was not then in its present palatial form) by December 1659.

At the Restoration in 1660, when Charles II took the throne, Russell was elected as a Member of Parliament for the borough of Tavistock, a seat traditionally held by a member of his family. For many years, Russell appears not to have been active in public affairs, but to have indulged in court intrigue, and is not recorded as speaking until 1674. In 1663 and 1664 he was engaged in two duels; he was wounded in the second one. In 1669, at age 30, he married the widowed Lady Vaughn. He thus became connected with the Earl of Shaftesbury, who had married his wife&#x27;s cousin. They had a close and affectionate marriage.

==Parliament==

It was not until the formation of the country party (the forerunner of the Whig party), which opposed the policies of the Cabal (the inner group of advisers to the king) and Charles II&#x27;s Franco-Catholic policies, that Russell began to take an active part in affairs. With a passionate zeal against Roman Catholicism (&quot;I despise such a ridiculous and nonsensical religion&quot; he once remarked), and an intense love of political liberty, he opposed the persecution of Protestant Dissenters. His first speech in Parliament appears to have been on 22 January 1674, when he inveighed against the Great Stop of the Exchequer, the attack on the Smyrna fleet, the corruption by French money of Charles&#x27;s courtiers, and the ill-intended ministers of the king. He also supported the proceedings against the Duke of Buckingham. In 1675, Russell moved an address to the king for the removal from royal councils and impeachment of the Earl of Danby.

On 15 February 1677, in the debate on the 15 months&#x27; prorogation (an extremely lengthy period between sessions of Parliament), he moved the dissolution of Parliament; and in March 1678 he seconded the address that asked the king to declare war against France. The enmity of the country party towards James, the Duke of York, and towards Lord Danby, and the party&#x27;s desire for a dissolution and the disbanding of the army, were greater than the party&#x27;s enmity towards Louis XIV of France. The French king, therefore, found it easy to form a temporary alliance with Russell, Holles and the opposition leaders. They sought to cripple the king&#x27;s power of hurting France and to compel him to seek Louis&#x27;s friendship; that friendship, however, was to be given only on the condition that Louis support their goals. Russell entered into close communication with the Marquis de Ruvigny (Lady Russell&#x27;s maternal cousin), who came over to England with money for distribution among members of parliament. By the testimony of Barillon, however, it is clear that Russell himself refused to take any French payments.

==The alleged Popish Plot and the Monmouth Rebellion==

Anti-French, warmongering alarms which culminated in the &quot;discovery&quot; in 1678 of the first &quot;conspirators&quot; of an alleged Popish Plot to treacherously murder King Charles II and accelerate the accession of his Roman Catholic brother, appear to have affected Russell more than his otherwise sober character would have led people to expect. Russell threw himself into the small party which looked to James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth (&quot;Monmouth&quot;) to take the throne, an (illegitimate but recognised) son of Charles, as the representative of Protestant interests, a political blunder. Undaunted, Russell afterwards was in confidential communication with William of Orange who, with his wife Mary, came to the throne five years after Russell&#x27;s execution.

==Exclusion debates==

On 4 November 1678, Russell moved an address to the King to exclude his brother James (at the time the Duke of York) &quot;from his person and councils&quot; (homes, companionship and correspondence), including removal from the line of succession. Parliament&#x27;s insistence on the impeachment of Danby led to it being prorogued on 30 December and dissolved in January. At the ensuing election, Russell was again elected to Parliament, this time as a representative for Bedfordshire, as well as for Hampshire (for which he chose not to sit). The success of the newly formed &quot;party&quot; in the elections of 1679 led to Danby&#x27;s removal from cabinet, and in April 1679 Russell became a member of the new Privy Council ministry formed by Charles on the advice of Sir William Temple of Temple Mount, East Sheen. Only six days after this, Russell moved for a committee to draw up a more subdued bill &quot;to secure religion and property [in case of] a popish successor&quot;. In June 1679, when the Covenanters were rising in Scotland, he verbally attacked (the Duke of) Lauderdale personally in full council.

 In January 1680, Russell, along with Cavendish, Capell, Powle, and Essex, tendered resignation, which was received by King Charles &quot;with all my heart.&quot; On 16 June, he accompanied Shaftesbury when the latter indicted James at Westminster as a popish recusant; and on 26 October, he spoke in the house to move to &quot;suppress popery and prevent a popish successor&quot;; while on 2 November, now at the height of his influence, he seconded the motion for exclusion in its most emphatic shape, and on 19 November physically carried the exclusion bill to the House of Lords. He opposed the limitation scheme on the ground that monarchy under its conditions would be an absurdity. The historian Laurence Echard stated that Russell opposed the indulgence exercised by Charles to the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s cousin, Lord Stafford, who was a convicted &quot;plotter&quot;, in preventing a more painful method of execution—an indulgence afterwards shown to Russell himself but other historians disagree. On 18 December, he moved to refuse supplies until the king passed the Exclusion Bill. The Prince of Orange having come over at this time, the opposition leaders were open to a compromise on the exclusion question. Russell, however, refused to give way.

On 26 March 1681, in the parliament held at Oxford, Russell again seconded the Exclusion Bill. Upon the dissolution of parliament, he retired into privacy at his country seat of Stratton in Hampshire. It was probably at his wish that his chaplain wrote the &quot;Life of Julian the Apostate&quot;, in reply to Dr Hickes&#x27;s sermons, defending the lawfulness of resistance in extreme cases.

==Rye House Plot==

Russell had no share in the schemes of Whig Lord Shaftesbury after the election of Tory sheriffs for London in 1682; upon the 1683 violation of the charters, however, he began seriously to consider the best means of resisting the King&#x27;s government. In October 1682, he attended a meeting at which what might be construed as treason was talked: Monmouth, Essex, Hampden, Algernon Sidney, Lord Howard of Escrick (a cousin of Russell&#x27;s mother) and Sir Thomas Armstrong met at the house of one Mr Sheppard, a wine merchant. There they met Richard Rumbold, the owner of Rye House, a fortified mansion in Hertfordshire.

This was followed by the unsuccessful Rye House Plot, a plan to ambush Charles II and his brother James near Rye House, Hoddesdon, on their way back to London from the Newmarket races. However, the plot was disclosed to the government. Unlike several co-conspirators, Russell refused to escape to Holland. He was accused of promising his assistance to raise an insurrection and bring about the death of the king. He was sent on 26 June 1683 to the Tower of London where he prepared himself for his death. Monmouth offered to return to England and be tried if doing so would help Russell, and Essex refused to abscond for fear of injuring his friend&#x27;s chance of escape. However, he was tried and convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, afterwards commuted by Charles II to death by beheading.

By the standards of the time (when those charged with treason rarely escaped death) he received a fair trial. Lord Chief Justice Francis Pemberton, in his summing up to the jury, clearly leant towards an acquittal, thereby offending the King, who dismissed him soon afterwards. No defence counsel was permitted in a treason trial until the passing of the Treason Act 1695, but in a rare concession to the defence, Lady Russell was allowed to act as her husband&#x27;s secretary. Even Jeffreys, leading for the prosecution, conducted the trial in a sober and dignified manner quite different from his normal bullying style, and, while stressing the strength of the evidence, reminded the jury that no innocent man should have his life taken away.

After the verdict Russell&#x27;s wife and friends made desperate efforts to save him, making pleas for mercy to the King, the Duke of York, and the French Ambassador, Paul Barillon. Barillon informed the King that in the view of Louis XIV this was a suitable case for mercy, and James was at least prepared to listen to Russell&#x27;s friends; but Charles was implacable, saying &quot;if I do not take his life he will shortly take mine.&quot; Russell himself, in petitions to Charles and James, offered to live abroad if his life were spared, and never again to meddle in the affairs of England. He, however, refused an offer of escape from Cavendish. Lady Russell obtained a private interview and went on her knees to the King, but to no avail.

==Execution==

Russell spent his last day peacefully in the Tower, spending the morning in devotions with the Scottish archbishop Alexander Burnet. He was beheaded by Jack Ketch on 21 July 1683 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Russell was said to have paid Ketch a generous sum of money beforehand for a quick and painless end. At the time, those sentenced to death by beheading (a method &quot;reserved for [...] aristocrats&quot;) were customarily &quot;advised to tip the public executioner in advance. It was hoped this would encourage him to do a swift and efficient job, hopefully despatching the victim in one clean blow.&quot; However, in spite of this, the execution was reported to have been notoriously botched:
On that occasion, Ketch wielded the instrument of death either with such sadistically nuanced skill or with such lack of simple dexterity – nobody could tell which – that the victim suffered horrifically under blow after blow, each excruciating but not in itself lethal. Even among the bloodthirsty throngs that habitually attended English beheadings, the gory and agonizing display had created such outrage that Ketch felt moved to write and publish a pamphlet titled &quot;Apologie&quot;, in which he excused his performance with the claim that Lord Russell had failed to &quot;dispose himself as was most suitable&quot; and that he was therefore distracted while taking aim on his neck.
According to the pamphlet, Ketch allegedly &quot;did such a bad job that, after the axe hit the side of Russell&#x27;s head, Russell looked up at him and said, &#x27;You dog, did I give you ten guineas to use me so inhumanely?&#x27;&quot; However, Ketch &quot;repudiated the charge&quot; that Russell had paid him twenty guineas the night before the execution (although he stated it was &quot;true I receav&#x27;d 10. Guenies&quot; from him on the scaffold), that Russell had insulted him, or that he had struck Russell&#x27;s shoulder rather than his head. However, although biographer Sidney Lee contended that the pamphlet was &quot;probably written by Ketch himself&quot;, author Stephen Wade describes the provenance of &quot;The Apology of John Ketch Esq.&quot; as &quot;questionable&quot;.

Russell was exonerated by reversal of his attainder under William III.

Russell did not confess; in fact, he pleaded that he knew of no plot to execute the king and was not party to any conspiracy to do so. He is recorded as having admitted to conspiring to levy a war. Such a mini-invasion ultimately took place and was successful; simply put, Russell did not time his meetings correctly. He resigned himself rapidly to accept his fate with dignity while still stating his innocence, but was disappointed in the justice he had received, as laid out in his last letter before his death. Russell was later pardoned as having committed no part in a directly treasonous plot, casting the evidence as hearsay. The pardon remains an official document.

Whigs later commemorated him as a mistreated martyr, supposedly put to death in retaliation for his efforts to exclude James from succession to the crown.

Several people were tried and convicted of seditious libel for publishing works about his ghost.

<doc id="1336396" wikidata="Q451451" url="?curid=1336396" title="Antony Flew">
<text>Antony Garrard Newton Flew (; 11 February 1923 – 8 April 2010) was an English philosopher. Belonging to the analytic and evidentialist schools of thought, Flew worked on the philosophy of religion. During the course of his career he taught philosophy at the universities of Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele, and Reading in the United Kingdom, and at York University in Toronto, Canada.

For much of his career Flew was an advocate of atheism, arguing that one should presuppose atheism until empirical evidence suggesting the existence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. In 2003, he was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto III. He also developed the No true Scotsman fallacy, and debated retrocausality with Michael Dummett.

However, in 2004 he changed his position, and stated that he now believed in the existence of an intelligent designer of the universe, shocking colleagues and fellow atheists. In order to further clarify his personal conception of God, Flew openly made an allegiance to Deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God, a Divine Watchmaker removed from human affairs but responsible for the intricate workings of the universe, and dismissed on many occasions a hypothetical conversion to Christianity, Islam, or any other religion. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to go where the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.

In 2007 a book outlining his reasons for changing his position, &quot;There is a God: How the World&#x27;s Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind&quot;, was written by Flew in collaboration with Roy Abraham Varghese, and included a chapter on the resurrection of Jesus. An article in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; alleged that Flew&#x27;s intellect had declined due to senility, and that the book was primarily the work of Varghese; Flew himself specifically denied this, stating that the book represented his views; although he acknowledged that due to his age Varghese had done most of the actual work of writing the book.

== Life and career ==
Antony Flew, the son of Methodist minister and theologian Robert Newton Flew (1886–1962) and his wife Winifred &quot;née&quot; Garrard (1887–1982), was born in London. He was educated at St Faith&#x27;s School, Cambridge followed by Kingswood School, Bath. He is said to have concluded by the age of 15 that there was no God. During the Second World War he studied Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and was a Royal Air Force intelligence officer. After a period with the Inter-Services Topographical Department in Oxford, he was posted to Bletchley Park in June 1944.

In the post-war era, Flew achieved a first class degree in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford (1947). He also won the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the following year. Flew was a graduate student of Gilbert Ryle, prominent in ordinary language philosophy. Both Flew and Ryle were among many Oxford philosophers fiercely criticised in Ernest Gellner&#x27;s book &quot;Words and Things&quot; (1959). A 1954 debate with Michael Dummett over backward causation was an early highlight in Flew&#x27;s career.

For a year, 1949–1950, Flew was a lecturer in philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford. From 1950 to 1954 he was a lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, and from 1954 to 1971 he was a professor of philosophy at the University of Keele. He held a professorship at the University of Calgary, 1972–1973. Between 1973 and 1983 he was professor of philosophy at the University of Reading. At this time, he developed one of his most famous arguments, the No true Scotsman fallacy in his 1975 book, &quot;Thinking About Thinking&quot;. Upon his retirement, Flew took up a half-time post for a few years at York University in Toronto, Canada.

Politically, Flew was a right-wing libertarian-leaning conservative who opposed immigration, egalitarianism, and the European Union, and wrote articles for &quot;The Journal of Libertarian Studies&quot;. His name appears on letterheads into 1992 as a vice-president of the Conservative Monday Club, and he held the same position in the Western Goals Institute. He was one of the signatories to a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; along with Lord Sudeley, Sir Alfred Sherman, and Dr. Harvey Ward, on behalf of the institute, &quot;applauding Alfredo Cristiani&#x27;s statesmanship&quot; and calling for his government&#x27;s success in defeating the Cuban and Nicaraguan-backed communist FMLN in El Salvador. In 1999 he wrote the foreword to a publication of the British far-right think tank Bloomsbury Forum, &quot;Standard Bearers: British Roots of the New Right&quot;. In political philosophy, the main interest of Antony Flew was in opposing the concept of social justice, i.e. the idea that income and wealth should be redistributed among the population in accordance with a principle of economic equality.

While an undergraduate, Flew attended the weekly meetings of C. S. Lewis&#x27; Socratic Club fairly regularly. Although he found Lewis to be &quot;an eminently reasonable man&quot; and &quot;by far the most powerful Christian apologists for the sixty or more years following his founding of that club&quot;, he was not persuaded by Lewis&#x27; argument from morality as found in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; (1952). Flew also criticised several of the other philosophical arguments for God&#x27;s existence. He concluded that the ontological argument in particular failed because it is based on the premise that the concept of Being can be derived from the concept of Goodness. Only the scientific forms of the teleological argument ultimately impressed Flew as decisive.

During the time of his involvement in the Socratic Club, Flew also wrote the article &quot;Theology and Falsification&quot;, which argued that claims about the existence of a God were merely vacuous since they couldn&#x27;t be falsified, therefore it was impossible to test these claims for truth or falsehood. Flew was also critical of the idea of life after death and the free will defence to the problem of evil. In 1998, he debated Christian apologist and philosopher William Lane Craig over the existence of God.

Flew married on 28 June 1952. He had two daughters. Flew died on 8 April 2010, while nursed in an extended care facility in Reading, England, suffering from dementia.

== Atheism and Deism ==

=== &quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot; ===
Antony Flew&#x27;s most influential professional works was his 1976 &quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot; in which Flew forwarded the proposition that the question of God&#x27;s existence should begin with the presupposition of atheism until empirical evidence for the existence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. 

Flew&#x27;s proposal to change his profession&#x27;s use of the term &quot;atheism&quot; saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew&#x27;s definition of the negative sense of atheism came to be forwarded more commonly by people who identify as atheists. According to Christian apologist and philosopher William Lane Craig&#x27;s 2007 assessment regarding the impact of Flew&#x27;s proposed concept of negative atheism, the presumption of atheism has become &quot;one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism.&quot; According to the &quot;BBC&quot; journalist William Crawley 2010&#x27;s analysis: &quot;&quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot; (1976) made the case, now followed by today&#x27;s new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position&quot;. In recent debates, atheists often forward &quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot; referring to atheism as the &quot;default position&quot;, &quot;no burden of proof&quot;, or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theists who claim that God exists.

===Revised views===

====Conversion to Deism====
On several occasions, starting in 2001, rumors circulated claiming that Flew had converted from atheism to Deism; Flew denied these rumours on the Secular Web website.

In January 2004, Flew and Gary Habermas, his friend and philosophical adversary, took part in and conducted a dialogue on the resurrection at California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo. While Flew did not change his position at that time, he concluded that certain philosophical and scientific considerations were causing him to do some serious rethinking. He characterized his position as that of atheism standing in tension with several huge question marks.

In a 2004 interview (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, stated that he now believed in the existence of an intelligent designer of the universe, and explained that he had become a Deist. In the article, Flew stated that he had renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism. In order to further clarify his personal conception of God, Flew openly made an allegiance to Deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God, a Divine Watchmaker removed from human affairs but responsible for the intricate workings of the universe, and dismissed on many occasions a hypothetical conversion to Christianity, Islam, or any other religion. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to go where the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.

During that same 2004 interview, Flew explicitly rejected the idea of life after death, of God as the source of good (he explicitly stated that God has created &quot;a lot of&quot; evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he had allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of his resurrection to be added into his latest book. Flew was particularly hostile towards Islam, and said it is &quot;best described in a Marxian way as the uniting and justifying ideology of Arab imperialism.&quot; In a December 2004 interview, he declared: &quot;I&#x27;m thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins&quot;.

====Controversy over his position====
In October 2004 (before the December publication of the Flew–Habermas interview), in a letter written to the internet atheist advocate Richard Carrier of the Secular Web, Flew stated that he was a Deist, and wrote &quot;I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of Aristotle or Spinoza and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations.&quot; Flew also said: &quot;My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.&quot;

When asked in December 2004 by Duncan Crary of Humanist Network News if he still stood by the argument presented in &quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot;, Flew replied that he did and reaffirmed his position as Deist: &quot;I&#x27;m quite happy to believe in an inoffensive inactive god.&quot; When asked by Crary whether or not he has kept up with the most recent science and theology, he responded with &quot;Certainly not,&quot; stating that there is simply too much to keep up with. Flew also denied that there was any truth to the rumours of 2001 and 2003 that he had converted to Christianity.

His 2007 book &quot;There is a God&quot; revisited the question, however, and questioned contemporary models: &quot;the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done.&quot; He added: &quot;The philosophical question that has not been answered in origin-of-life studies is this: How can a universe of mindless matter produce beings with intrinsic ends, self-replication capabilities, and &#x27;coded chemistry&#x27;? Here we are not dealing with biology, but an entirely different category of problem&quot;.

However, in spring 2005 when atheist Raymond Bradley, emeritus professor of philosophy at Simon Fraser University and a member of the editorial board of &quot;The Open Society&quot; journal, wrote an open letter to Flew accusing him of not &quot;check[ing] the veracity of Gerald Schroeder&#x27;s claims before swallowing them whole,&quot; Flew responded strongly to that charge in a letter published in the same journal in summer 2006, describing the content of Bradley&#x27;s letter &quot;extraordinarily offensive&quot; and the accusation made by him as an &quot;egregiously offensive charge&quot;; he also implied that Bradley was a &quot;secularist bigot,&quot; and suggested that he should follow Socrates&#x27; advice (as scripted in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;) of &quot;follow[ing] the argument wherever it leads.&quot; Other prominent atheists, such as Richard Dawkins, suggested Flew&#x27;s deism was a form of God of the gaps.

Flew said in December 2004:
====Restatement of position====
A letter on evolution and theology which Flew published in the August/September 2004 issue of &quot;Philosophy Now&quot; magazine closed with, &quot;Anyone who should happen to want to know what I myself now believe will have to wait until the publication, promised for early 2005, by Prometheus of Amherst, NY of the final edition of my &quot;God and Philosophy&quot; with a new introduction of it as &#x27;an historical relic&#x27;.&quot;

The preface of &quot;God and Philosophy&quot; states that the publisher and Flew went through a total of four versions before coming up with one that satisfied them both. The introduction raises ten matters that came about since the original 1966 edition. Flew states that any book to follow &quot;God and Philosophy&quot; will have to take into account these ideas when considering the philosophical case for the existence of God:

# A novel definition of &quot;God&quot; by Richard Swinburne
# The case for the existence of the Christian God by Swinburne in the book &quot;Is There a God?&quot;
# The Church of England&#x27;s change in doctrine on the eternal punishment of Hell
# The question of whether there was only one Big Bang and if time began with it
# The question of multiple universes
# The fine-tuning argument
# The question of whether there is a naturalistic account for the development of living matter from non-living matter
# The question of whether there is a naturalistic account for non-reproducing living matter developing into a living creature capable of reproduction
# The concept of an &quot;Intelligent Orderer&quot; as explained in the book &quot;The Wonder of the World: A Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God&quot; by Roy Abraham Varghese
# An extension of an Aristotelian/Deist concept of God that can be reached through natural theology, which was developed by David Conway.

In an interview with Joan Bakewell for &quot;BBC Radio 4&quot; in March 2005, Flew rejected the fine-tuning argument as a conclusive proof: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it proves anything but that it is entirely reasonable for people who already have a belief in a creating God to regard this as confirming evidence. And it&#x27;s a point of argument which I think is very important – to see that what is reasonable for people to do in the face of new evidence depends on what they previously had good reason to believe.&quot; He also said it appeared that there had been progress made regarding the naturalistic origins of DNA. However, he restated his deism, with the usual provisos that his God is not the God of any of the revealed religions. In the same interview, Flew was asked whether he was retracting belief in an Aristotelian God, but answered no.

One month later, Flew told &quot;Christianity Today&quot; that although he was not on the road to becoming a convert to Christianity, he reaffirmed his belief in Deism: &quot;Since the beginning of my philosophical life I have followed the policy of Plato&#x27;s Socrates: We must follow the argument wherever it leads.&quot;

In late 2006, Flew joined 11 other academics in urging the British government to teach intelligent design in the state schools.

In 2007, in an interview with Benjamin Wiker, Flew said again that his deism was the result of his &quot;growing empathy with the insight of Einstein and other noted scientists that there had to be an Intelligence behind the integrated complexity of the physical Universe&quot; and &quot;my own insight that the integrated complexity of life itself – which is far more complex than the physical Universe – can only be explained in terms of an Intelligent Source.&quot; He also restated that he was not a Christian theist.

===Book with Varghese and authorship controversy===
In 2007, Flew published a book titled &quot;There is a God&quot;, which was listed as having Roy Abraham Varghese as its co-author. Shortly after the book was released, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; published an article by historian of religion Mark Oppenheimer, who stated that Varghese had been almost entirely responsible for writing the book, and that Flew was in a serious state of mental decline, having great difficulty remembering key figures, ideas, and events relating to the debate covered in the book. His book praises several philosophers (like Brian Leftow, John Leslie and Paul Davies), but Flew failed to remember their work during Oppenheimer&#x27;s interview.

A further article by Anthony Gottlieb noted a strong difference in style between the passages giving Flew&#x27;s biography, and those laying out the case for a god, the latter including Americanisms such as &quot;beverages&quot;, &quot;vacation&quot; and &quot;candy&quot;. He came to the same conclusion as Oppenheimer, and stated that &quot;Far from strengthening the case for the existence of God, [the book] rather weakens the case for the existence of Antony Flew&quot;. Varghese replied with a letter disputing this view.

Flew later released a statement through his publisher stating:
 An audio commentary by William Lane Craig concurs with this position, but Richard Carrier disputed this view. In June 2008, Flew stated his position once again, in a letter to a fellow of the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship.

Christian writer Regis Nicoll claims that &quot;Moreover, in a signed, handwritten letter (a copy of which I now have) sent to Roy Varghese, the legendary philosopher reaffirmed his conversion while criticising Oppenheimer for drawing attention away from the book’s central argument: the collapse of rationalism.&quot; He argues that &quot;Even Mark Oppenheimer described the ex-atheist &#x27;flaunt[ing] his allegiance to deism&#x27; in May 2006 to a Christian audience at Biola University.&quot;
Perhaps most definitively, Christian apologist Anthony Horvath corresponded with Antony Flew before it was publicly known there would even be a book. In 2010, he published his letters. The letters contain Flew&#x27;s description of the outline of the book, his Deism in the pattern of Einstein&#x27;s, and his high praise of N.T. Wright&#x27;s arguments for Christianity. All of these elements are present in the book.

==Awards==
Flew was awarded the Schlarbaum Prize by the Ludwig von Mises Institute for his &quot;outstanding lifetime achievement in the cause of liberty.&quot; Upon acceptance of the award in Auburn, Alabama, in September 2001, Flew delivered an address entitled &quot;Locke versus Rawls on Equality.&quot; Of his choice of topics, he stated &quot;I am the first Englishman and the first professional philosopher to receive the Schlarbaum Prize. So it seems appropriate to begin by talking about the greatest English philosopher, John Locke.&quot;

On 11 May 2006, Antony Flew accepted the second &quot;Phillip E. Johnson Award for Liberty and Truth&quot; from Biola University. The award, named for its first recipient, was given to Flew &quot;for his lifelong commitment to free and open inquiry and to standing fast against intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression&quot;. When informed of his award, Flew remarked, &quot;In light of my work and publications in this area and the criticism I’ve received for changing my position, I appreciate receiving this award&quot;.

He was an honorary associate of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In 1985, Flew was awarded the &quot;In Praise of Reason Award&quot; the highest honor the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awards. The award was presented by Chairman Paul Kurtz in London &quot;&#x27;[I]n recognition of his long-standing contributions to the use of methods of critical inquiry, scientific evidence, and reason in evaluating claims to knowledge and solving social problems.&quot;

<text>Fin Garden ( &quot;Bagh-e Fin&quot;) is a historical Persian garden located in Kashan, Iran. It contains Kashan&#x27;s Fin Bath, where Amir Kabir, the Qajarid chancellor, was murdered by an assassin sent by King Nasereddin Shah in 1852. Completed in 1590, the Fin Garden is the oldest extant garden in Iran.

==History==
The origins of the garden may be anterior to the Safavid period; some sources indicate that the garden has been relocated from another place, but no clear picture of it has been found.

The settlements of the garden in its present form was built under the reign of Abbas I of Persia (1571–1629), as a traditional bagh near the village of Fin, located a few kilometres southwest of Kashan.

The garden subsequently suffered from neglect and was damaged several times until, in 1935, it was listed as a national property of Iran. On 2007, 8 September, Bagh-e Fin was submitted to the UNESCO&#x27;s Tentative List.

Unesco declared the garden a World Heritage Site on July 18, 2012.

==Structure==
The garden covers 2.3 hectares with a main yard surrounded by ramparts with four circular towers. In keeping with many of the Persian gardens of this era, the Fin Garden employs a great many water features.

ISO Rivolta has its origins in Isothermos of Bolzaneto, a factory producing electric heaters and chillers, purchased by the engineer Renzo Rivolta in 1939 and moved to Bresso in 1942, after a bombing raid on Genoa destroyed the offices. Immediately after the end of World War II, Renzo Rivolta decided to devote his company to the production of motorbikes, a type of market that offered significant commercial profits in those years.

===Early years: motorcycles===
The Iso scooter was one of the company&#x27;s early vehicles. It was equipped with a twin-cylinder engine inspired by the 125 Puch. Together with the Isomoto, the company was encouraged to add new versions and models such as the Isocarro, Iso GT, Iso Sport and Iso Ciclo.

In 1957, developing a project created on behalf of Maserati, the company replaced the now obsolete Iso 125 with a new model (Iso F/150) with more compliant lines that did not disappoint expectations. It remained in production until 1962, when the Iso company limited its production solely to cars. In 1961, a final 500 cm3 motorbike with a boxer engine was presented, but never went into production.

===Cars===

In the early 1950s, Renzo Rivolta developed the concept for a car that was halfway between a car and a motorbike, to bridge the gap between the classic motorcycle and the cheapest Italian car of the time, the Fiat Topolino. The idea was to create a motorbike with a body in order to have a vehicle that was equally as economical, but with the protection offered by a normal car.
The company register changed to Iso Autoveicoli and in 1953 the Isetta was launched. The Isetta featured a distinctive &quot;egg&quot; shape, and was powered by the engine already fitted on the Isomoto 200, albeit increased to 236 cm3 with an aluminum cylinder and chromed cane. It was a sort of cabin scooter, with four wheels (the two rear were fixed, closer to each other) and a cockpit for two passengers, with only one way in: the front door, which was designed to be the car&#x27;s nose as well, including the windscreen and steering wheel.

The Isetta was not a great success in Italy. Therefore, Renzo Rivolta decided to license the project abroad. The result was the VELAM Isetta for the French market and the Romi Isetta for the Brazilian and South American markets in general, and then the BMW Isetta. The Bavarian company was far from being a healthy company due to an unfavorable post-war reorganization and the unsuccessful high-end models it offered after the war. The launch of the BMW 250, i.e., the BMW-branded Isetta, was much more successful than in Italy. In the end, a total of 160,000 units were produced and sold.
At the end of 1956, production of the Iso Isetta ceased. In the meantime, the Bresso-based company produced the Iso 400, a small, more conventional car with a three-volume body that remained at the prototype stage.

At the beginning of 1957, Iso ended its activities in the fields of microcars and motorbikes. Renzo Rivolta aimed to take a new direction and, from the ashes of Iso Autoveicoli, founded Iso Rivolta — a car manufacturer targeting the narrow market of high-end Gran Turismos, with production halfway between the GTs of the German or American school and the GTs of the Italian school.

The real transition to passenger car production took place in 1962 with the public presentation of the Iso Rivolta IR 300, a luxury coupé designed by Bertone (through Giorgetto Giugiaro’s sketches) with a chassis developed by Eng. Giulio Alfieri and powered by a V8 engine from a Chevrolet Corvette. The 300 in the name indicated the engine output: 300 hp. From that moment on, it was also clear what kind of cars the Iso would produce: high-performance grand touring cars with top-level finishes.

In 1963, the Iso A3 was built and exhibited on the Iso Rivolta stand at the Turin Auto Show. Intended for racing with the acronym A3/C, it was entrusted to Giotto Bizzarrini, who was hired by Iso as a track engineer. The bodywork, on the other hand, was made at Piero Drogo&#x27;s Carrozzeria Sports Cars in Modena using 1,700 rivets. In fact, the second Iso model was nicknamed &quot;millechiodi&quot;. In 1965, the &quot;berlinetta&quot; version of the A3 was sold to the actor and singer Johnny Hallyday, who helped make it a lifestyle icon.

===Iso Grifo A 3 L===
With the start of sales in the United States and the signing of a stable powertrain contract with General Motors, the company began the production of a new lineup of models based on the GT 300 chassis (standard, extended or shortened). The result was the Grifo sports coupé (1965), with engines from 5.4 to 7 liters, the Fidia luxury saloon (1968) and the Lele 2+2 grand tourer (1969) designed by Marcello Gandini, chief designer at Bertone.

By the end of 1971, due to the unfavorable economic conditions imposed by GM (demanding advance payment for the engines, which had to be purchased in bloc), the company adopted Ford Cleveland engines. Competition from prestigious brands, especially Maserati and Aston Martin (but also, for some models, Ferrari and Lamborghini), and the oil crisis of 1973, put Iso Rivolta in financial jeopardy.

At the beginning of 1973, the Rivolta family listed the company on the New York Stock Exchange. An agreement with Philip Morris and the young team manager Frank Williams led to the formation of the Iso-Marlboro Formula 1 team (the original name of Frank Williams Racing Cars).

The business name of the company changed to Iso Motors &amp; Co. due to the raking in of the stock exchange shares made by the Italian-American Iso Pera. After producing 10,000 ISO snowmobiles, the Rivolta family eventually gave up ownership.

The costs of managing the team, the drop in sales due to the economic and social crises in the first half of the 1970s and conditions in the U.S. market (where the company was late in obtaining the status of &quot;Small Manufacturer&quot;, which applied less stringent sanctions standards) led to the end of car production on December 31, 1974.

===ORSA 850 Spring Special===

In anticipation of the impact of the oil crisis on granturismo cars, the Rivolta family decided at the end of 1972 to partner with the ORSA company, a modest industrial plant founded by a small group of Sardinian entrepreneurs on the outskirts of Cagliari, equipped for the small-scale construction of retro-style open cars. For this purpose, the Spring model assembly lines were taken over from SIATA, which had closed its doors. Since the Fiat 850, on whose chassis the Siata Spring was built, was no longer in production, an agreement was made with SEAT, which was still building it in Spain.

===Legacy===

The &quot;&#x27;Museo ISO Rivolta&quot; is a project that has been in development for years, with a plan to inhabit the former warehouses of the historic factory in Bresso. It was intended to collect motorbikes and cars. In 2008, the municipal administration dedicated a newly built street in the former factory area of Bresso to the Isetta.

One of the two surviving warehouses of the Bresso factory has housed the new post office of the municipality since 2013.

===Refoundation===

In 2017, after an initiative by Atelier Zagato, the Iso Rivolta brand was brought back into life and had its name turned into ISO Rivolta. It was first placed on the Vision concept car, created to race virtually in SONY PlayStation&#x27;s GranTurismo and adopted by over 120,000 gamers.

This success led to the Rivolta family&#x27;s decision to revive the company with its first GT model of the new millennium: the GTZ. The design and production of these exclusive collectible cars were entrusted to Zagato. The technological partnership with GM&#x27;s Chevrolet Corvette for the project is a historic one, with only 19 GTZs to be produced.

<doc id="1336406" wikidata="Q3400520" url="?curid=1336406" title="Vavasor Powell">
<text>Vavasor (or Vavasour) Powell (161727 October 1670) was a Welsh Puritan and Fifth Monarchist, imprisoned for his role in a plot to depose King Charles II.

==Early life==

Powell was born in Knucklas, Radnorshire, and may have been educated at Jesus College, Oxford. He returned to Wales as a schoolmaster (1638–1639), during which time he was converted to the Puritan understanding of the Gospel under the preaching of the Puritan Walter Cradock, and through the writings of Richard Sibbs (1577–1635) and William Perkins (1558–1602).

==Preaching ==
In about 1639 Powell became an itinerant preacher and was arrested twice for preaching in various parts of Wales in 1640. However, he was not punished and during the Civil War he preached in and around London.
In the same year he was the first minister of Pendref Chapel, Llanfyllin, which is said to be the oldest Welsh independent church in Powys.

On 26 December 1641 he was preaching in Llanyre Parish Church in Rhos when he was forcibly removed by Hugh Lloyd and twelve armed men and imprisoned.

In 1646, when Parliament&#x27;s victory was certain, Powell returned to Wales having received a &quot;certificate of character&quot; from the Westminster Assembly, although he had refused to be ordained by the Presbyterians. With a salary granted to him by parliament he resumed his itinerant preaching in Wales.

==Advisor to Parliament and controversy ==
In 1650 Parliament appointed a commission for the better propagation and preaching of the gospel in Wales, with Powell acting as one of the principal advisers of this body. For three years he was actively employed in removing from their parishes those ministers whom he regarded as incompetent.

During this time Powell was involved in a controversy with Welsh poet Katherine Philips. Powell had published a poem celebrating the regicide of Charles I, and Philips responded with hers, &quot;Upon the Double Murder of King Charles in Answer to a Libellous Rhyme made by V.P.&quot; This was one of her first forays into political writing, and she is one of the first women to do so in literature. When it became apparent the poem may be published, and so embarrass her husband James Philips, she was forced to apologise. She did so in the form of another poem but whilst distancing herself from the views of her husband she reinforced her criticism of Powell.

==Preaching in London and royal plot==

In 1653 Powell returned to London to preach at St Ann Blackfriars after the death of their pastor, William Gouge. Having denounced Cromwell for accepting the office of Lord Protector, he was imprisoned.

At the Restoration, on 18 July 1660, the Council of King Charles II issued an order to Sir Matthew Price, High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire to take into safe custody Vavasour Powell (described as, &quot;a most factious and dangerous minister&quot;), Sir Richard Saltonstall, and Richard Price of Aberbechan.
According to Price&#x27;s letters to Secretary of State Edward Nicholas, Vavasour Powell, Saltonstall and Price were concerned in a plot to depose King Charles II. Letters were found in their possession indicating the plot extended all the way to London. By 2 August 1660 Vavasour Powell was taken into custody, while Sir Richard Saltonstall and Captain Richard Price &quot;had left these parts&quot; (Montgomeryshire).

Powell remained in prison for seven years. He was imprisoned at Southsea Castle in September 1667. He was set free in 1667, but in the following year he was again imprisoned and was in custody until his death on 27 October 1670. Powell is buried at Bunhill Fields cemetery in London.

==Work==

Powell wrote eleven books and some hymns but his chief gifts were those of a preacher. During his ministry he preached before the Lord Mayor of London (1649), Parliament (1650) and as an ardent defender of Calvinism held disputations with popular Arminians of his day.
While remaining a relatively minor figure in seventeenth-century Puritan history since his death, Powell&#x27;s place in the Puritan movement has been reassessed in recent years. The twentieth-century Welsh theologian R. Tudur Jones wrote of Powell:

Vavasor Powell deserves better of historians than to be dismissed as a millenarian enthusiast. In many ways, Powell was the most striking personality amongst the Welsh Puritans.

That estimation has been heeded as Powell has been the subject of doctoral dissertations as well as several peer-reviewed papers and presentations. Powell has emerged as a leading case study for the right wing elements of seventeenth century English Non Conformity and their relationship to the larger Puritan movement.

<text>NEWFM (call sign: 2NEW) is an Australian radio station, licensed to, and serving Newcastle and its surrounding area. It is owned by Bill Caralis&#x27;s Broadcast Operations Group, and operates at 105.3 megahertz on the FM band from Radio Centre at Sandgate. Great Mt Sugarloaf houses the transmitter site. Its callsign is 2NEW, the 2 being a standard prefix for stations in New South Wales, and NEW short for Newcastle. Its sister station is 2HD. On 24 May 2005, NEWFM reverted to its original 1989 logo which has since been modernised.

==History==
NEWFM was the first commercial FM radio station in Newcastle, founded by Mike Webb. It commenced broadcasting on 14 April 1989, with the AC/DC song It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll). The station officially launched on 6 May of that year, accompanied by pyrotechnics and laser technology.

In its first ratings survey, the station achieved a ratings share of 24.7%.

In 1994, Labour–owned 2HD bought out the station&#x27;s shareholders for $2.3 million. In March 1999, both radio stations (2HD and NEW-FM) were sold to Bill Caralis&#x27;s Broadcast Operations Group, for $12.5 million.

In 2008 NEWFM became the Hub of the Super Network FM Stations (NEWFM Network) supplying programming from its Sandgate based studios to stations from the New South Wales/Victorian border in the south, north to the Sunshine Coast and Whitsundays in Queensland and West to Broken Hill and Alice Springs.

<doc id="1336421" wikidata="Q1928951" url="?curid=1336421" title="Satellite geodesy">
<text>Satellite geodesy is geodesy by means of artificial satellites—the measurement of the form and dimensions of Earth, the location of objects on its surface and the figure of the Earth&#x27;s gravity field by means of artificial satellite techniques. It belongs to the broader field of space geodesy. Traditional astronomical geodesy is &quot;not&quot; commonly considered a part of satellite geodesy, although there is considerable overlap between the techniques.

The main goals of satellite geodesy are:

# Determination of the figure of the Earth, positioning, and navigation (geometric satellite geodesy)
# Determination of geoid, Earth&#x27;s gravity field and its temporal variations (dynamical satellite geodesy or satellite physical geodesy)
# Measurement of geodynamical phenomena, such as crustal dynamics and polar motion

Satellite geodetic data and methods can be applied to diverse fields such as navigation, hydrography, oceanography and geophysics. Satellite geodesy relies heavily on orbital mechanics.

==History==
===First steps (1957–1970)===
Satellite geodesy began shortly after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Observations of Explorer 1 and Sputnik 2 in 1958 allowed for an accurate determination of Earth&#x27;s flattening. The 1960s saw the launch of the Doppler satellite Transit-1B and the balloon satellites Echo 1, Echo 2, and PAGEOS. The first dedicated geodetic satellite was ANNA-1B, a collaborative effort between NASA, the DoD, and other civilian agencies. ANNA-1B carried the first of the US Army&#x27;s SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) instruments. These missions led to the accurate determination of the leading spherical harmonic coefficients of the geopotential, the general shape of the geoid, and linked the world&#x27;s geodetic datums.

Soviet military satellites undertook geodesic missions to assist in ICBM targeting in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Toward the World Geodetic System (1970–1990)===

The Transit satellite system was used extensively for Doppler surveying, navigation, and positioning. Observations of satellites in the 1970s by worldwide triangulation networks allowed for the establishment of the World Geodetic System. The development of GPS by the United States in the 1980s allowed for precise navigation and positioning and soon became a standard tool in surveying. In the 1980s and 1990s satellite geodesy began to be used for monitoring of geodynamic phenomena, such as crustal motion, Earth rotation, and polar motion.

===Modern era (1990–present)===

The 1990s were focused on the development of permanent geodetic networks and reference frames. Dedicated satellites were launched to measure Earth&#x27;s gravity field in the 2000s, such as CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE.

==Measurement techniques==
Techniques of satellite geodesy may be classified by instrument platform: A satellite may
#be observed with ground-based instruments (&quot;Earth-to-space-methods&quot;),
#carry an instrument or sensor as part of its payload to observe the Earth (&quot;space-to-Earth methods&quot;),
#or use its instruments to track or be tracked by another satellite (&quot;space-to-space methods&quot;).

===Earth-to-space methods (satellite tracking)===
====Radio techniques====

Global navigation satellite systems are dedicated radio positioning services, which can locate a receiver to within a few meters. The most prominent system, GPS, consists of a constellation of 31 satellites (as of December 2013) in high, 12-hour circular orbits, distributed in six planes with 55° inclinations. The principle of location is based on trilateration. Each satellite transmits a precise ephemeris with information on its own position and a message containing the exact time of transmission. The receiver compares this time of transmission with its own clock at the time of reception and multiplies the difference by the speed of light to obtain a &quot;pseudorange.&quot; Four pseudoranges are needed to obtain the precise time and the receiver&#x27;s position within a few meters. More sophisticated methods, such as real-time kinematic (RTK) can yield positions to within a few millimeters.

In geodesy, GNSS is used as an economical tool for surveying and time transfer. It is also used for monitoring Earth&#x27;s rotation, polar motion, and crustal dynamics. The presence of the GPS signal in space also makes it suitable for orbit determination and satellite-to-satellite tracking.

&quot;Examples: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo&quot;

=====Doppler techniques=====
Doppler positioning involves recording the Doppler shift of a radio signal of stable frequency emitted from a satellite as the satellite approaches and recedes from the observer. The observed frequency depends on the radial velocity of the satellite relative to the observer, which is constrained by orbital mechanics. If the observer knows the orbit of the satellite, then recording the Doppler profile determines the observer&#x27;s position. Conversely, if the observer&#x27;s position is precisely known, then the orbit of the satellite can be determined and used to study the Earth&#x27;s gravity. In DORIS, the ground station emits the signal and the satellite receives.

&quot;Examples: Transit, DORIS, Argos&quot;

====Optical triangulation ====

In optical triangulation, the satellite can be used as a very high target for triangulation and can be used to ascertain the geometric relationship between multiple observing stations. Optical triangulation with the BC-4, PC-1000, MOTS, or Baker Nunn cameras consisted of photographic observations of a satellite, or flashing light on the satellite, against a background of stars. The stars, whose positions were accurately determined, provided a framework on the photographic plate or film for a determination of precise directions from camera station to satellite. Geodetic positioning work with cameras was usually performed with one camera observing simultaneously with one or more other cameras. Camera systems are weather dependent and that is one major reason why they fell out of use by the 1980s.

&quot;Examples: PAGEOS, Project Echo, ANNA 1B&quot;

====Laser ranging====
In satellite laser ranging (SLR) a global network of observation stations measure the round trip time of flight of ultrashort pulses of light to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. This provides instantaneous range measurements of millimeter level precision which can be accumulated to provide accurate orbit parameters, gravity field parameters (from the orbit perturbations), Earth rotation parameters, tidal Earth&#x27;s deformations, coordinates and velocities of SLR stations, and other substantial geodetic data. Satellite laser ranging is a proven geodetic technique with significant potential for important contributions to scientific studies of the Earth/Atmosphere/Oceans system. It is the most accurate technique currently available to determine the geocentric position of an Earth satellite, allowing for the precise calibration of radar altimeters and separation of long-term instrumentation drift from secular changes in ocean surface topography.
Satellite laser ranging contributes to the definition of the international terrestrial reference frames by providing the information about the scale and the origin of the reference frame, the so-called geocenter coordinates.

&quot;Example: LAGEOS&quot;

===Space-to-Earth methods===

====Altimetry====
Satellites such as Seasat (1978) and TOPEX/Poseidon (1992-2006) used advanced dual-band radar altimeters to measure the height of the Earth&#x27;s surface (sea, ice, and terrestrial surfaces) from a spacecraft. Jason-1 began in 2001, Jason-2 in 2008 and Jason-3 in January 2016. 
That measurement, coupled with orbital elements (possibly augmented by GPS), enables determination of the terrain. The two different wavelengths of radio waves used permit the altimeter to automatically correct for varying delays in the ionosphere.

Spaceborne radar altimeters have proven to be superb tools for mapping ocean-surface topography, the hills and valleys of the sea surface. These instruments send a microwave pulse to the ocean&#x27;s surface and record the time it takes to return. A microwave radiometer corrects any delay that may be caused by water vapor in the atmosphere. Other corrections are also required to account for the influence of electrons in the ionosphere and the dry air mass of the atmosphere. Combining these data with the precise location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch). The strength and shape of the returning signal also provides information on wind speed and the height of ocean waves. These data are used in ocean models to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents and the amount and location of heat stored in the ocean, which in turn reveals global climate variations.

=====Laser altimetry=====
A laser altimeter uses the round-trip flight-time of a beam of light at optical or infrared wavelengths to determine the spacecraft&#x27;s altitude or, conversely, the ground topography.

&quot;Examples: ICESat, MOLA.&quot;

=====Radar altimetry=====
A radar altimeter uses the round-trip flight-time of a microwave pulse between the satellite and the Earth&#x27;s surface to determine the distance between the spacecraft and the surface. From this distance or height, the local surface effects such as tides, winds and currents are removed to obtain the satellite height above the geoid. With a precise ephemeris available for the satellite, the geocentric position and ellipsoidal height of the satellite are available for any given observation time. It is then possible to compute the geoid height by subtracting the measured altitude from the ellipsoidal height. This allows direct measurement of the geoid, since the ocean surface closely follows the geoid. The difference between the ocean surface and the actual geoid gives ocean surface topography.

&quot;Examples: Seasat, Geosat, TOPEX/Poseidon, ERS-1, ERS-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, Envisat, SWOT (satellite)&quot;

====Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)====
Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. This geodetic method uses two or more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to generate maps of surface deformation or digital elevation, using differences in the phase of the waves returning to the satellite. The technique can potentially measure centimetre-scale changes in deformation over timespans of days to
years. It has applications for geophysical monitoring of natural hazards, for example earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also in structural engineering, in particular monitoring of subsidence and structural stability.

&quot;Example: Seasat, TerraSAR-X&quot;

===Space-to-space methods===

====Gravity gradiometry====

A gravity gradiometer can independently determine the components of the gravity vector on a real-time basis. A gravity gradient is simply the spatial derivative of the gravity vector. The gradient can be thought of as the rate of change of a component of the gravity vector as measured over a small distance. Hence, the gradient can be measured by determining the difference in gravity at two close but distinct points. This principle is embodied in several recent moving-base instruments. The gravity gradient at a point is a tensor, since it is the derivative of each component of the gravity vector taken in each sensitive axis. Thus, the value of any component of the gravity vector can be known all along the path of the vehicle if gravity gradiometers are included in the system and their outputs are integrated by the system computer. An accurate gravity model will be computed in real-time and a continuous map of normal gravity, elevation, and anomalous gravity will be available.

&quot;Example: GOCE&quot;

====Satellite-to-satellite tracking====
This technique uses satellites to track other satellites. There are a number of variations which may be used for specific purposes such as gravity field investigations and orbit improvement.
* A high altitude satellite may act as a relay from ground tracking stations to a low altitude satellite. In this way, low altitude satellites may be observed when they are not accessible to ground stations. In this type of tracking, a signal generated by a tracking station is received by the relay satellite and then retransmitted to a lower altitude satellite. This signal is then returned to the ground station by the same path.
* Two low altitude satellites can track one another observing mutual orbital variations caused by gravity field irregularities. A prime example of this is GRACE.
* Several high altitude satellites with accurately known orbits, such as GPS satellites, may be used to fix the position of a low altitude satellite.

These examples present a few of the possibilities for the application of satellite-to-satellite tracking. Satellite-to-satellite tracking data was first collected and analyzed in a high-low configuration between ATS-6 and GEOS-3. The data was studied to evaluate its potential for both orbit and gravitational model refinement.
&quot;Example: GRACE&quot;

<text>Beaumont-Hamel () is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.
During the First World War, Beaumont-Hamel was close to the front line, near many attacks, especially during the Battle of the Somme, one of the largest allied offensives of the war.

On 1 July 1916, the First Day of the Somme, the 29th Division assaulted the German front line in an attempt to capture the village as part of the Somme Offensive. Included in this division was the Newfoundland Regiment. Newfoundland commemorates this event as Memorial Day on 1 July each year.

Its capture by the 51st (Highland) Division on 18 November 1916 marked the end of the Battle of the Somme. Fought over for many years, by 1918, the village had been almost totally destroyed.

The banks of white chalk at Beaumont-Hamel led to a sector of British trenches being nicknamed &quot;White City&quot;. To the west of the village was Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, one of the sites of the mines exploded on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.


==Notable sights==
As there was heavy fighting in this area during the Great War, there are many cemeteries and monuments, among which:
* A number of British cemeteries (among which Beaumont-Hamel British Cemetery)
* Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial. One of only two National Historic Sites of Canada outside Canada (the other being the Canadian National Vimy Memorial) and includes three British Cemeteries (Y Ravine Cemetery, Hawthorn Ridge Cemetery No. 2 and Hunter&#x27;s Cemetery) as well as the Scottish Monument and a memorial to the 29th division (of which the Newfoundland Regiment was a part).
* Hawthorn Ridge Crater

<doc id="1336424" wikidata="Q1071360" url="?curid=1336424" title="Publish–subscribe pattern">
<text>In software architecture, publish–subscribe or pub/sub is a messaging pattern where publishers categorize messages into classes that are received by subscribers. This is contrasted to the typical messaging pattern model where publishers send messages directly to subscribers.

Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

Publish–subscribe is a sibling of the message queue paradigm, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the pub/sub and message queue models in their API; e.g., Java Message Service (JMS).

This pattern provides greater network scalability and a more dynamic network topology, with a resulting decreased flexibility to modify the publisher and the structure of the published data. According to Gregor Hohpe, compared with synchronous messaging patterns (such as RPC) and point-to-point messaging patterns, publish–subscribe provides the highest level of decoupling among architectural components, however it can also couple them in some other ways (such as format and semantic coupling) so they become messy over time. 

==Message filtering==

In the publish–subscribe model, subscribers typically receive only a subset of the total messages published. The process of selecting messages for reception and processing is called &quot;filtering&quot;. There are two common forms of filtering: topic-based and content-based.

In a topic-based system, messages are published to &quot;topics&quot; or named logical channels. Subscribers in a topic-based system will receive all messages published to the topics to which they subscribe. The publisher is responsible for defining the topics to which subscribers can subscribe.

In a content-based system, messages are only delivered to a subscriber if the attributes or content of those messages matches constraints defined by the subscriber. The subscriber is responsible for classifying the messages.

Some systems support a hybrid of the two; publishers post messages to a topic while subscribers register content-based subscriptions to one or more topics.

==Topologies==
In many publish–subscribe systems, publishers post messages to an intermediary message broker or event bus, and subscribers register subscriptions with that broker, letting the broker perform the filtering. The broker normally performs a store and forward function to route messages from publishers to subscribers. In addition, the broker may prioritize messages in a queue before routing.

Subscribers may register for specific messages at build time, initialization time or runtime. In GUI systems, subscribers can be coded to handle user commands (e.g., click of a button), which corresponds to build time registration. Some frameworks and software products use XML configuration files to register subscribers. These configuration files are read at initialization time. The most sophisticated alternative is when subscribers can be added or removed at runtime. This latter approach is used, for example, in database triggers, mailing lists, and RSS.

The Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware does not use a broker in the middle. Instead, each publisher and subscriber in the pub/sub system shares meta-data about each other via IP multicast. The publisher and the subscribers cache this information locally and route messages based on the discovery of each other in the shared cognizance. In effect, brokerless architectures require publish/subscribe system to construct an overlay network which allows efficient decentralized routing from publishers to subscribers. It was shown by Jon Kleinberg that efficient decentralised routing requires Navigable Small-World topologies. Such Small-World topologies are usually implemented by decentralized or federated publish/subscribe systems. Locality-aware publish/subscribe systems construct Small-World topologies that route subscriptions through short-distance and low-cost links thereby reducing subscription delivery times.

==History==
One of the earliest publicly described pub/sub systems was the &quot;news&quot; subsystem of the Isis Toolkit, described at the 1987 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Operating Systems Principles conference (SOSP &#x27;87), in a paper &quot;Exploiting Virtual Synchrony in Distributed Systems. 123–138.&quot;

==Advantages==
===Loose coupling===
Publishers are loosely coupled to subscribers, and need not even know of their existence. With the topic being the focus, publishers and subscribers are allowed to remain ignorant of system topology. Each can continue to operate as per normal independently of the other. In the traditional tightly coupled client–server paradigm, the client cannot post messages to the server while the server process is not running, nor can the server receive messages unless the client is running. Many pub/sub systems decouple not only the locations of the publishers and subscribers but also decouple them temporally. A common strategy used by middleware analysts with such pub/sub systems is to take down a publisher to allow the subscriber to work through the backlog (a form of bandwidth throttling).

===Scalability===
Pub/sub provides the opportunity for better scalability than traditional client-server, through parallel operation, message caching, tree-based or network-based routing, etc. However, in certain types of tightly coupled, high-volume enterprise environments, as systems scale up to become data centers with thousands of servers sharing the pub/sub infrastructure, current vendor systems often lose this benefit; scalability for pub/sub products under high load in these contexts is a research challenge.

Outside of the enterprise environment, on the other hand, the pub/sub paradigm has proven its scalability to volumes far beyond those of a single data center, providing Internet-wide distributed messaging through web syndication protocols such as RSS and Atom. These syndication protocols accept higher latency and lack of delivery guarantees in exchange for the ability for even a low-end web server to syndicate messages to (potentially) millions of separate subscriber nodes.

===Message delivery issues===
* Redundant subscribers in a pub/sub system can help assure message delivery with minimal additional complexity. For example, a factory may utilize a pub/sub system where equipment can publish problems or failures to a subscriber that displays and logs those problems. If the logger fails (crashes), equipment problem publishers won&#x27;t necessarily receive notice of the logger failure, and error messages will not be displayed or recorded by any equipment on the pub/sub system. In a client/server system, when an error logger fails, the system will receive an indication of the error logger (server) failure. However, the client/server system will have to deal with that failure by having redundant logging servers online, or by dynamically spawning fallback logging servers. This adds complexity to the client and server designs, as well as to the client/server architecture as a whole. In a pub/sub system, redundant logging subscribers that are exact duplicates of the existing logger can be added to the system to increase logging reliability without any impact to any other equipment on the system. The feature of assured error message logging can also be added incrementally, subsequent to implementing the basic functionality of equipment problem message logging.

==Disadvantages==

The most serious problems with pub/sub systems are a side-effect of their main advantage: the decoupling of publisher from subscriber.

===Message delivery issues===
A pub/sub system must be designed carefully to be able to provide stronger system properties that a particular application might require, such as assured delivery.
* The broker in a pub/sub system may be designed to deliver messages for a specified time, but then stop attempting delivery, whether or not it has received confirmation of successful receipt of the message by all subscribers. A pub/sub system designed in this way cannot guarantee delivery of messages to any applications that might require such assured delivery. Tighter coupling of the designs of such a publisher and subscriber pair must be enforced outside of the pub/sub architecture to accomplish such assured delivery (e.g. by requiring the subscriber to publish receipt messages).
* A publisher in a pub/sub system may assume that a subscriber is listening, when in fact it is not.

The pub/sub pattern scales well for small networks with a small number of publisher and subscriber nodes and low message volume. However, as the number of nodes and messages grows, the likelihood of instabilities increases, limiting the maximum scalability of a pub/sub network. Example throughput instabilities at large scales include:
* Load surges—periods when subscriber requests saturate network throughput followed by periods of low message volume (underutilized network bandwidth)
* Slowdowns—as more and more applications use the system (even if they are communicating on separate pub/sub channels) the message volume flow to an individual subscriber will slow

For pub/sub systems that use brokers (servers), the argument for a broker to send messages to a subscriber is in-band, and can be subject to security problems. Brokers might be fooled into sending notifications to the wrong client, amplifying denial of service requests against the client. Brokers themselves could be overloaded as they allocate resources to track created subscriptions.

Even with systems that do not rely on brokers, a subscriber might be able to receive data that it is not authorized to receive. An unauthorized publisher may be able to introduce incorrect or damaging messages into the pub/sub system. This is especially true with systems that broadcast or multicast their messages. Encryption (e.g. Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)) can prevent unauthorized access, but cannot prevent damaging messages from being introduced by authorized publishers. Architectures other than pub/sub, such as client/server systems, are also vulnerable to authorized message senders that behave maliciously.

<doc id="1336426" wikidata="Q5603108" url="?curid=1336426" title="Green Ribbon Club">
<text>The Green Ribbon Club was one of the earliest of the loosely combined associations which met from time to time in London taverns or coffeehouses for political purposes in the 17th century. The green ribbon was the badge of the Levellers in the English Civil Wars, in which many of them had fought, and was an overt reminder of the radical origins of the club&#x27;s loyalties.

==Meetings and name==
The club met at the King&#x27;s Head tavern at Chancery Lane End and therefore was known as the King&#x27;s Head Club. It seems to have been founded about the year 1675 by men of a political faction hostile to the king&#x27;s court. These associates wore on their hats a bow, or bob, of green ribbon, as a distinguishing badge useful for the purpose of mutual recognition in street brawls. The name of the club was changed, about 1679, to the Green Ribbon Club. The King&#x27;s Head Tavern, described by North as &quot;over against&quot; (meaning opposite) the Inner Temple Gate, was at the corner of Fleet Street and Chancery Lane, on the east side of the latter thoroughfare.

==Membership==
The frequenters of the club were the extreme faction of the country party, the men who supported Titus Oates, and who were concerned in the Rye House Plot and Monmouth&#x27;s rebellion. Roger North tells us that they admitted all strangers that were confidingly introduced, for it was the main end of their institutions to make proselytes, especially of the raw estated youth newly come to town. According to Dryden (&quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;) drinking was the chief attraction, and the members talked and organized sedition over their cups.

Thomas Dangerfield supplied the court with a list of forty-eight members of the Green Ribbon Club in 1679; and although Dangerfield&#x27;s numerous perjuries make his unsupported evidence worthless, it receives confirmation as regards several names from a list given to James II by Nathaniel Wade in 1685 (Harleian Manuscript 6845,), while a number of more eminent personages are mentioned in &quot;The Cabal&quot;, a satire published in 1680, as also frequenting the club.

From such sources it appears that the Duke of Monmouth himself, and statesmen like Halifax, Shaftesbury, Buckingham, Macclesfield, Cavendish, Bedford, Grey of Warke, were among those who fraternized at the King&#x27;s Head Tavern with third-rate writers such as Scroop, Mulgrave and Shadwell; with remnants of the Cromwellian régime like Lord Falconbridge, John Claypole and Henry Ireton (two sons-in-law and a grandson of the old Protector); with such profligates as Lord Howard of Escrick and Sir Henry Blount; and with scoundrels of the type of Dangerfield and Oates.

An allusion to Dangerfield, notorious among his other crimes and treacheries for a seditious paper found in a meal-tub, is found in connection with the club in &quot;The Loyal Subject&#x27;s Litany&quot;, one of the innumerable satires of the period, in which occur the lines:
:&quot;From the dark-lanthorn Plot, and the Green Ribbon Club From brewing sedition in a sanctified Tub, &quot;Libera nos, Domine&quot;&quot;.

==Activities==
The club was the headquarters of the Whig opposition to the court, and its members were active promoters of conspiracy and sedition. The president was either Lord Shaftesbury or Sir Robert Peyton, MP for Middlesex, who later turned informer. The Green Ribbon Club served both as a debating society and an intelligence department for the Whig faction. Questions under discussion in parliament were here threshed out by the members over their tobacco and ale; the latest news from Westminster or the city was retailed in the tavern, for some or others were continually coming and going, says Roger North, to import or export news and stories.

Slander of the court or the Tories was invented in the club and sedulously spread over the town, and measures were concerted there for pushing on the Exclusion Bill, or for promoting the pretensions of the Duke of Monmouth. The popular credulity as to Catholic outrages in the days of the Popish Plot was stimulated by the scandalmongers of the club, whose members went about in silk armour, supposed to be bulletproof, in which any man dressed up was as safe as a house, says North, for it was impossible to strike him for laughing; while in their pockets, for street and crowd-work, they carried the weapon of offence, a kind of club, invented by Stephen College and known as the Protestant Flail.

The genius of Shaftesbury found in the Green Ribbon Club the means of constructing the first systematized political organization in England. North relates that every post conveyed the news and tales legitimated there, as also the malign constructions of all the good actions of the government, especially to places where elections were depending, to shape men&#x27;s characters into fit qualifications to be chosen or rejected. In the general election of January and February 1679 the Whig interest throughout the country was managed and controlled by a committee sitting at the club in Chancery Lane.

The club&#x27;s organizing activity was also effective in the agitation of the Petitioners in 1679. This celebrated movement was engineered by the Green Ribbon Club with all the skill and energy of a modern caucus. The petitions were prepared in London and sent down to every part of the country, where paid canvassers took them from house to house collecting signatures with an air of authority that made refusal difficult. The great pope-burning processions in 1680 and 1681, on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, were also organized by the club. They ended by the lighting of a huge bonfire in front of the club windows; and as they proved an effective means of inflaming the religious passions of the populace, it was at the Green Ribbon Club that the mobile vulgus first received the nickname of the mob. The activity of the club was short-lived.

==Decline==
The failure to carry the Exclusion Bill, one of the favourite projects of the faction, was a blow to its influence, which declined rapidly after the flight of Shaftesbury, the confiscation of the city of London&#x27;s charter, and the discovery of the Rye House Plot, in which many of its members were implicated. In 1685 John Ayloffe, who was found to have been a clubber at the King&#x27;s Head Tavern and a green-ribbon man, was executed in front of the premises on the spot where the pope-burning bonfires had been kindled; and although the tavern was still in existence in the time of Queen Anne, the Green Ribbon Club which made it famous did not survive the accession of James II.

<doc id="1336427" wikidata="Q21889732" url="?curid=1336427" title="Maylands, Western Australia">
<text>Maylands is a riverside inner-city suburb approximately northeast of Perth centred on the Midland, High Wycombe and Ellenbrook railway lines on the northern bank of the Swan River.

The suburb was developed during the 1890s and is an administrative locality within the City of Bayswater (having been mostly within the City of Stirling until 1998), bordered by the suburbs of Mount Lawley, East Perth and Bayswater. Maylands railway station provides easy access to the City centre and beyond. The railway line was originally built in the 1880s, and the railway station was extensively refurbished in 2000. Recently a shared bicycle / pedestrian path was built to link Maylands with neighbouring suburbs via the shoreline of the Swan River. There is also a small yacht club and a golf course.

Maylands was once a source of clay for brick and tile making at Maylands Brickworks, and the pits from these activities are now part of a golf course and residential area. It was home to Perth&#x27;s main airport which serviced many kinds of aircraft and even flying boats until the early 1960s, when the airport moved to Perth Airport. The facilities were then converted to a training area for the Western Australian Police Service.

==History==
In 1896, the name &quot;Maylands&quot; was first used to identify the area, appearing on a poster advertising a land auction. However the exact reason how the area got its name is something of a mystery. One theory is that Mephan Ferguson (owner of the local foundry) was responsible for naming the area, in honour of his aunt and daughter whom were both named May. Another theory is the area was named by Edgar. W. Hamer (Golds Estates of Australia) after he inspected land in the locality sometime in the month of May.

=== Historic Peninsula Hotel ===
The Peninsula Hotel is located on Railway Parade in Maylands, Perth. The hotel was built in 1906 by well known building contractor, Friederich Wilhelm Gustave Liebe.

===Old Maylands Aerodrome===

The Maylands Aerodrome was built at Maylands to support West Australian Airways Ltd, which flew the first commercial air service in Australia (before Qantas).

Maylands Airport was where Charles Kingsford Smith made his landing to complete the first non-stop flight across Australia. On 8 August 1928, the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; took off from Point Cook near Melbourne and set course for Perth, a distance of over . The first part of the flight Kingsford-Smith described as rather dull, while the second part was made thoroughly unpleasant by a cloud cover their heavy machine couldn&#x27;t rise out of. For hours they endured the bitter cold and when daylight finally came, they discovered that they had drifted off course to Bunbury, to the south. After their arrival at Maylands airport they found that summer rains had turned the field more or less into a swamp.

During World War II, Maylands Airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). From February 1942, it was also used by the United States Army Air Forces for refuelling and aircraft ferrying purposes. Between 6 April 1942 and 5 August 1943, No. 35 Squadron, flying Avro Ansons, was based at Maylands to transport supplies and passengers to Allied units throughout Western Australia, as well as supporting the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army.

===Revitalisation===
In December 2009, the City of Bayswater endorsed the Maylands Activity Centre Urban Design Framework following widespread community consultation. The Urban Design Framework provides the strategic direction for the future of the Maylands town centre. This document has been instrumental in guiding the ongoing revitalisation of the Maylands town centre.

Over recent years, Maylands&#x27; revitalisation has gathered significant momentum, with a variety of new developments and businesses bringing new residents and vibrancy to the town centre. New bars, cafés and restaurants, along with gourmet food and retail outlets have all contributed to an ongoing transformation of the Maylands town centre into a lively, diverse and inclusive destination.

== Culture and arts ==
=== Western Australian Ballet ===
The West Australian Ballet Centre is situated on the historical site of the former Blind Institute in Maylands. The history of the building site dates back to 1897 when the Victoria Institute and the Industrial School for the Blind was developed as a part of the celebrations for the 60th year of Queen Victoria’s reign.

This magnificent building has become a symbol that illustrates Perth’s short history. With its high ceilings, rustic wooded floors, classical charm and character, the building sets a perfect tone for the West Australian Ballet. The building’s disposition provides the artistic team with a creative and innovative backdrop to aid in the creation of world class productions.

=== Lyric Lane ===
The recent Council approval of the Lyric Lane Bar and Café has seen the establishment of a purpose-built venue consisting of a bar, cafe and a live music basement, which provides for new cultural pursuits in the town centre. The project is now open.

=== WA Youth Jazz Orchestra ===
It has recently been announced that the Western Australian Youth Jazz Orchestra will soon take up residence in the old Maylands Hall at the corner of Eighth Avenue and Guildford Road.

<doc id="1336442" wikidata="Q4383923" url="?curid=1336442" title="High king">
<text>A high king is a king who holds a position of seniority over a group of other kings, without the title of emperor. Similar titles include great king and king of kings. The high kings of history usually ruled over lands of cultural unity; thus high kings differentiate from emperors who control culturally different lands, and feudal monarchs, where subordinates assume lesser positions. High kings can be chosen by lesser rulers through elections, or be put into power by force through conquest of weaker kingdoms.

==High kingship==
In history and literature, high kings may be found where there is a high degree of cultural unity, along with sufficient political fragmentation that the high king&#x27;s subordinates style themselves kings. In this respect, high kingships frequently differ from empires, which are culturally as well as politically heterogeneous, as well as from feudal monarchies, where the subordinate rulers take lesser titles (such as duke or count) and may be, at least in theory, subject to appointment and dismissal by the sovereign.

In this model, a high king might be chosen from among a group of kings in his personal capacity, for instance by election or on the basis of genealogical superiority. Alternatively, the high kingship might be attached to the kingship of one of the constituent kingdoms, either permanently or when one kingdom is able to assert supremacy over the others. The high king&#x27;s authority over other kings is usually limited, and in some high 
kingships his duties are largely ceremonial or restricted to occasions such as war that create a need for a unified command structure.

==Historical high kings==
Rulers who have been termed &quot;high king&quot; (by their contemporaries or by modern observers) include:
*Various rulers of the ancient and early medieval kingdoms in Great Britain and Ireland have been called &quot;High King&quot;;
**the High King of Ireland (&quot;), such as Brian Boru.
**the High King of Scotland (&quot;), like Macbeth.
**the King of the Britons, such as Cassivellaunus, Cunobeline, and possibly Vortigern, have been termed &quot;High King of Britain&quot;. 
**the ruler of the Picts.
**the &quot;Bretwalda&quot; was essentially the high king of the Anglo-Saxons, though the name is rarely translated as such.
*some ancient Greek rulers, such as Agamemnon (see &quot;anax&quot;)
*the most powerful king of the various Etruscan city-states
*&quot;Mepe-Umaglesi&quot; (most high king) was a predicate of the Georgian Orthodox &quot;Mepe-Mepeta&quot; (king of kings)
*in Lithuania, the title of &quot;Didysis Kunigaikštis&quot; is more accurately translated as &quot;high king&quot;, although it is traditionally rendered as &quot;grand duke&quot;.
*in ancient Sumer, the rulers of all Sumer held the title of &quot;Nam-Lugal&quot; (high king).

In Imperial Germany, the German Emperor (&quot;Deutscher Kaiser&quot;), who was also the King of Prussia, could be considered a contemporary &quot;high king&quot;, as he held seniority over the other monarchs of the empire (three kings, six grand dukes, five reigning dukes and seven reigning princes) as &quot;president of the confederation&quot;.

The &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; (literally &quot;supreme lord&quot;) in Malaysia could probably be seen as a &quot;high king&quot;, as he is elected from among nine Malay rulers of the states (seven sultans, a raja, and a &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Besar&quot;-literally &quot;great lord&quot;) by the Conference of Rulers (through informal agreement, on a rotational basis). In practice, however, the term &quot;high king&quot; is rarely applied to the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; (king).

&quot;Adhiraja&quot; or &quot;Adiraja&quot; is the comparable term of high king in the Indian subcontinent. The maharaja and maharajadhiraja could possibly be rendered as &quot;high king&quot; since it was a result of title inflation which soon led to most being rather mediocre or even petty in real power, which led to compound titles (among other efforts) being used in an attempt to distinguish some among their ranks. 

&quot;Taewang&quot;, meaning &quot;greatest of kings&quot;, was used by the later rulers of the Korean kingdom of Koguryo (and Silla, albeit to a rarer extent) to rank themselves as equals to the Chinese emperors or to express suzerainty over surrounding states, particularly during the Three Kingdoms Era. &quot;Daewang&quot; (great king) was used by rulers of other kingdoms and subsequent dynasties, including Baekje, whose king assumed the style of &quot;Daewang Pyeha&quot; (&quot;his imperial majesty the great king&quot;) by the reign of King Mu (600–640 AD at the latest). However, after the Mongol Invasions of Korea, these rulers remained technically subordinate to the Mongol Empire and later China until King Gojong declared the Korean Empire in 1897 and assumed the title of &quot;Hwangje&quot;, or &quot;emperor&quot; (the Korean rendition of the Chinese &#x27;huang di&#x27;).

Originally, the rulers of (), an ancient name of Japan, was known as the &quot;Grand King of Yamato&quot; (, ) or the &quot;Kings of Wa&quot; (, ) prior to the 7th century. It was later changed to become the Emperor of Japan (, ).

The title &quot;king of kings&quot; also expresses much the same concept as &quot;high king&quot; – it was used at various times by the Emperor of Persia (&quot;&quot;) and the Emperor of Ethiopia. Similarly, the Imperial Mongolian title Khagan is sometimes translated as Khan of Khans.

== In fiction ==
* In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s epic fantasy, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, Peter Pevensie was the High King of Narnia while his younger brother Edmund Pevensie was the King and his sisters Susan Pevensie and Lucy Pevensie were the Queens. He was also the high king over all kings of Narnia, from the first to the last. Aslan, the deity and the Great Lion of Narnia, is described as being &quot;the High King above all High Kings&quot;, meaning he is the highest king over all rulers of Narnia.
* In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s works, mainly &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, there was a succession of high kings of the Noldor exiled in Middle-earth, beginning with Fingolfin and culminating in Gil-galad&#x27;s reign. Ingwë, leader of the Vanyar, is also called the High King of the Eldar, while Manwë is also sometimes titled High King of Arda. Thingol is acknowledged as high-king of Beleriand by Fingolfin. In the Third Age, the rulers of Arnor were known as &quot;high kings&quot;, including Aragorn, as King Elessar, ruling the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor at the beginning of the Fourth Age.
* In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, the first human king ruling in Westeros was called the High King of the First Men.
* In Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Prydain&quot;, there is a line of High Kings of Prydain (a fictionalized version of Wales) who are descendants of a royal family who came from the Summer Country in order to oppose Arawn. The high king throughout the series is Gwydion&#x27;s father Math, who is then succeeded by Gwydion and later Taran in the final novel of the series, &quot;The High King&quot;.
* In Bethesda Softworks&#x27; &quot;The Elder Scrolls,&quot; the high king is the highest authority in the Province of Skyrim and theoretically the high king of Alinor is also the highest authority of the Summerset Isle (later renamed Alinor).
* In Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Warcraft&quot;, the High King is the leader of the Alliance who has military control over the Alliance forces.
*In Holly Black&#x27;s &quot;The Folk of the Air&quot; series&quot;,&quot; there is a high king who rules over the land of faeries, Elfhame.
* is also the name of a J-pop group created in 2008 featuring Ai Takahashi, Reina Tanaka, Saki Shimizu, Maimi Yajima and Yuuka Maeda.
* In the Sega AM2 videogame Virtua Fighter 4, the title of High King (along with Emperor) is the highest rank attainable by playing the Kumite mode

<doc id="1336449" wikidata="Q3363716" url="?curid=1336449" title="Joseph Farah">
<text>Joseph Francis Farah (born July 6, 1954) is an American author, journalist, and editor-in-chief of the far-right website &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; &quot;(WND)&quot;. Farah gained prominence for promoting conspiracy theories surrounding the suicide of Vince Foster&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt_2/3/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is a proponent of birtherism, a debunked conspiracy theory that Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States.

==Early years==

Farah was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on July 6, 1954, to parents of Syrian and Lebanese ancestry. His father was a schoolteacher. He graduated from William Paterson University, in Wayne, New Jersey with a B.A. in Communications.

== Career ==

Farah worked for six years as executive news editor at the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; until the paper shuttered in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roig-Franzia_4/2/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 1990, Farah became editor of &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot;. The paper had been losing up to $3 million annually, and in early 1990 it was purchased from Richard Mellon Scaife by Daniel Benvenuti Jr. and David Kassis. Farah and the paper&#x27;s owners envisioned the paper as a conservative alternative to &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;. &quot;We just thought the way to go was to be unabashedly conservative in our approach,&quot; explained Farah to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Among other things, Farah convinced Rush Limbaugh to write a daily column, which ran on &quot;Page 1.&quot; Farah prohibited advertisement for films rated NC-17 in the newspaper.

In 1991, Farah left the &quot;Union&quot; and co-founded the Western Journalism Center. He writes a weekly print column for &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; which is nationally syndicated through Creators Syndicate.

He launched the online &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; in 1997. The website has been categorized as far-right and is known for publishing unreliable or fringe material.

In April 2019, &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; announced that Farah had suffered a stroke and would withdraw from the website&#x27;s day-to-day operations until he recovers. 

=== Promotion of conspiracy theories ===

Farah gained prominence for promoting conspiracy theories surrounding the suicide of Vince Foster.

Farah is a proponent of birtherism, the conspiracy theory related to Barack Obama&#x27;s status as a natural-born citizen of the United States and resultant eligibility to serve as U.S. president,&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin_2/25/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Babington_Ramer_4/27/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; stating, &quot;It&#x27;ll plague Obama throughout his presidency. It&#x27;ll be a nagging issue and a sore on his administration, much like Monica Lewinsky was on Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s not going to go away, and it will drive a wedge in an already divided public.&quot; Despite the release of Obama&#x27;s notarized birth certificate abstract, he continued to promote birtherism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stelter_4/27/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Farah offered a $15,000 award for the release of the certificate, but did not pay the award after its release.

== Personal life ==

He is married to Elizabeth Graham and is a conservative evangelical Christian. He has five children, including a daughter from a previous marriage to Judy Smagula, Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as the Press Secretary for Vice President Mike Pence and later served as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Media Affairs and Press Secretary for the Department of Defense.

formula_5

=== Geometric definition ===

If formula_1 is a Lie algebra, the tensor product of formula_1 with , the algebra of (complex) smooth functions over the circle manifold (equivalently, smooth complex-valued periodic functions of a given period),

formula_8

is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra with the Lie bracket given by

formula_9

Here and are elements of formula_1 and and are elements of .

This isn&#x27;t precisely what would correspond to the direct product of infinitely many copies of formula_1, one for each point in , because of the smoothness restriction. Instead, it can be thought of in terms of smooth map from to formula_1; a smooth parametrized loop in formula_1, in other words. This is why it is called the loop algebra.

== Gradation ==
Defining formula_14 to be the linear subspace formula_15 the bracket restricts to a productformula_16
hence giving the loop algebra a formula_17-graded Lie algebra structure.

In particular, the bracket restricts to the &#x27;zero-mode&#x27; subalgebra formula_18.

== Derivation ==

There is a natural derivation on the loop algebra, conventionally denoted formula_19 acting as
formula_20
formula_21
and so can be thought of formally as formula_22.

It is required to define affine Lie algebras, which are used in physics, particularly conformal field theory.

==Loop group==
Similarly, a set of all smooth maps from to a Lie group forms an infinite-dimensional Lie group (Lie group in the sense we can define functional derivatives over it) called the loop group. The Lie algebra of a loop group is the corresponding loop algebra.

==Affine Lie algebras as central extension of loop algebras==

If formula_1 is a semisimple Lie algebra, then a nontrivial central extension of its loop algebra formula_24 gives rise to an affine Lie algebra. Furthermore this central extension is unique.

The central extension is given by adjoining a central element formula_25, that is, for all formula_26,
formula_27
and modifying the bracket on the loop algebra to
formula_28
where formula_29 is the Killing form.

The central extension is, as a vector space, formula_30 (in its usual definition, as more generally, formula_31 can be taken to be an arbitrary field).

=== Cocycle ===

Using the language of Lie algebra cohomology, the central extension can be described using a 2-cocycle on the loop algebra. This is the mapformula_32
satisfying
formula_33
Then the extra term added to the bracket is formula_34

===Affine Lie algebra===
In physics, the central extension formula_35 is sometimes referred to as the affine Lie algebra. In mathematics, this is insufficient, and the full affine Lie algebra is the vector spaceformula_36
where formula_19 is the derivation defined above.

On this space, the Killing form can be extended to a non-degenerate form, and so allows a root system analysis of the affine Lie algebra.

<text>Pursued is a 1947 American Western film noir directed by Raoul Walsh with cinematography by James Wong Howe, written by Niven Busch, and starring Teresa Wright and Robert Mitchum. The supporting cast features Judith Anderson, Dean Jagger, Alan Hale Sr., and Harry Carey Jr. The music is by Max Steiner and the picture was shot on location in Gallup, New Mexico.

==Plot==
Set in New Mexico around the turn of the 20th century and told in flashback, the film tells the story of Jeb Rand, whose entire family was slaughtered when he was a child. In the aftermath of the massacre Jeb is found by Mrs Callum, a widow, who raises him in her family. Traumatized by the killings, Jeb does not recall anything of that night, except for vague images that he sees in a frequent nightmare. Mrs Callum raises him as her own son, together with her daughter Thorley &quot;Thor&quot; and her son Adam. Years later Jeb is shot at while riding a colt, but the shooter misses him. Although Mrs Callum blames the incident on deer hunters, she knows that it was an attempted murder by her brother-in-law, Grant. She confronts Grant and it is revealed that there has been a long-standing feud between the Rands and the Callums. Jeb&#x27;s father - with whom Mrs Callum was having an affair - took the life of her husband, and in an act of revenge, Grant killed Jeb&#x27;s family. The night of the massacre Grant&#x27;s arm was so severely injured he eventually lost it. Mrs Callum pleads with her brother-in-law to leave Jeb alone, reasoning that he is not a threat to anyone. Grant agrees to let Jeb live in order to prove to Mrs Callum that one day Jeb will turn on her.

Years later, Jeb, Adam and Thor are adults, and one day in 1898, law officials arrive to recruit volunteers to join the US Army. Jeb and Adam are told that one of them must join. After agreeing on a coin toss, Jeb loses the toss and signs up. He is injured in battle during the Spanish-American War, and while recuperating in hospital he again experiences the flashbacks to the night of his family&#x27;s murder. Due to his injuries he is honorably discharged from the army and awarded the Medal of Honor.

Jeb and Thor have long been in love. After his homecoming celebration, Jeb tries to persuade Thor to run away with him and get married as soon as possible. He suspects that someone, or something, is following him. Thor refuses, saying that she wishes to get married on her own terms and not out of fear. Jeb goes for a long horse ride in order to clear his head and stumbles upon an abandoned ranch which he suspects he has seen before. When he returns home, his mother confirms that the ranch he came across is where he lived with his real parents as child, and where the murders occurred. As Jeb prepares to leave to gamble at the casino in town, Adam shows him the money that had been set aside for him while he was in the army. He also shows Jeb the profits he is entitled to according to their mother&#x27;s wish that everything be split among the three. However, Adam calls Jeb&#x27;s share the &#x27;Rand share&#x27; and expresses resentment that there should be any money given to Jeb at all. The two come to the conclusion that the ranch is not big enough for both of them, and agree to a coin toss to determine who will leave. Jeb loses; Adam relishes throwing him out and they end up in a fistfight. Jeb declares he will return the next day for Thor and promises that, if Adam tries to stop him, he will kill him.

Jeb has a big win at the casino and the owner, Jake Dingle, offers him a partnership. Meanwhile Adam ambushes Jeb on his way back from the casino, but is killed by Jeb in self-defense. Jeb is acquitted of the murder in court but is shunned by Thor and Mrs Callum, who states that Jeb is dead to them. With no family, job, or home of his own, Jeb accepts Jake Dingle&#x27;s offer and becomes part-owner of the casino.

Months later Jeb discovers that Thor is engaged to a man named Prentice and learns that Thor and Prentice will be attending a town dance. Jeb attends the dance and forces Thor to dance with him. Grant Callum goads Prentice to defend Thor&#x27;s honor and persuades him to make an attempt on Jeb&#x27;s life. Jake Dingle warns Jeb that Prentice is coming for him. Jeb steps out the back door into the alley in an attempt to avoid the situation, but Prentice is coming down the street. The two engage in a gun battle and Jeb is once again forced to kill in self-defense.

Some time later Thor and Mrs Callum hatch a plan to gain revenge on Jeb for the pain he has caused them. Thor pretends to forgive Jeb and agrees to marry him, planning to murder him on their wedding night. When the moment arrives, Jeb reveals to her that he knows her plan; she cannot bring herself to carry out the murder and reconciles with him.

Grant Callum rounds up a gang of other Callums and they chase Jeb across the desert, intending to finish the job of killing all the Rands that Callum had begun all those years ago. Jeb finally recalls the night that his father and siblings were murdered, realizing that it was Grant who killed them and that Mrs Callum was there too. Thor learns that her mother had an affair with Jeb&#x27;s father, and that when Mrs Callum&#x27;s husband discovered it, he attempted to murder Rand, but was killed himself, resulting in Grant slaughtering Jeb&#x27;s entire family to avenge his brother&#x27;s death. On learning that Jeb survived the slaughter, Mrs Callum adopted him, out of guilt. Thor pleads with her mother not to allow Jeb to be hanged, stating there is still time to make up for her actions. As Grant is about to hang Jeb, Mrs Callum shoots him dead. She asks for and receives forgiveness from Jeb and Thor, and advises them to look to the future and enjoy their lives together.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s writer Niven Busch and leading lady Theresa Wright were married for a decade beginning in 1942. Wright and Robert Mitchum were cast together again seven years after &quot;Pursued&quot; in &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; (1954) directed by William A. Wellman, with Mitchum receiving top billing in their second pairing.

Busch later said &quot;I had absolute control over that. And I was very, very happy with the result. I had a marvelous cast, a terrific crew, and the best cameraman in the world [James Wong Howe]. I was very proud of the story; it has kind of Greek overtones—incest feeling, and all that—which the West was like. Greece in the ancient days must have been very much like the West. Passions were powerful and arms were at hand.&quot;

Busch based the script on a newspaper story he had read in El Paso Texas about a boy who was the only survivor of a family wiped out in a feud being raised by the family that killed his family. Busch produced the film and secured the services of his wife.

Before Robert Mitchum was cast, a number of actors were discussed for the lead including Robert Taylor, Joel McCrea (who Busch felt was too old for the role), Montgomery Clift (who Wright knew), and Kirk Douglas. 

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote a mixed review, &quot;... the strange and angry actions which occur through the tortuous wanderings of this drama seem decidedly bewildering and absurd. What&#x27;s so significant about a fellow—even though he may be a foster-child—finding life slightly oppressive on a primitive New Mexican ranch? ... As we say, without the revelation which comes rather patly at the end, the urgency of these weighty questions is hard to grasp as the picture drones along. And it is likewise hard to work up any sympathy for the hero, who seems bored by all his woes. That may be because Robert Mitchum, who plays the latter, is a very rigid gent and gives off no more animation than a Frigidaire turned to &#x27;Defrost.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine, on the other hand, praised the film. The &quot;Variety&quot; staff wrote, &quot;&quot;Pursued&quot; is potent frontier days Western film fare. Standout in picture is suspense generated by the original script and Raoul Walsh&#x27;s direction. It builds the western gunman&#x27;s death walk to high moments of thrill and action. Strong casting also is a decided factor in selling the action wares. Production makes use of natural outdoor backgrounds supplied by New Mexico scenery, lending air of authenticity that is fully captured by the camera.&quot;

It has been reported that the film was the last one to have ever been seen by legendary rock singer Jim Morrison. According to his girlfriend Pamela Courson, on the evening of Morrison&#x27;s death, they had gone to see the film while they lived in Paris and Jim gave the film an unfavorable critique.

===Box office===
According to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,536,000 domestically and $1,175,000 foreign.

<text>Karl Joachim Marquardt (19 April 1812 – 30 November 1882) was a German historian and writer on Roman antiquities.

In his later life he was Rector of the Ernestine Gymnasium, Gotha.

==Biography==
Marquardt was born at Danzig.

He studied at Berlin and Leipzig, held various educational appointments from 1833 onwards at Berlin, Danzig, and Posen, and became in 1859 head of the gymnasium in Gotha, where he died in 1882. The dedication of his treatise &quot;Historiae equitum romanorum libri quatuor&quot; (1841) to Lachmann led to his being recommended to the publisher of Wilhelm Adolf Becker&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch der römischen Alterthumer&quot; to continue the work on the death of Becker in 1846. The work took twenty years to complete, and met with such success that a new edition was soon called for. Finding himself unequal to the task single-handed, Marquardt left the preparation of the first three volumes (&quot;Römisches Staatsrecht&quot;) to Theodor Mommsen, while he himself contributed volumes V-VI (&quot;Römische Staatsverwaltung&quot;, 1873–1878) and volume VII (&quot;Das Privatleben der Römer&quot;, 1879–1882).
Its clearness of style, systematic arrangement, and abundant references to authorities ancient and modern, continue to make it valuable to students.

Marquardt died in Gotha, while still in office as Rector of the Ernestine Gymnasium, Gotha. The school commissioned a medal to commemorate Marquardt, made by the local engraver Fredinand Helfricht and issued on November 30, 1883, the first anniversary of his death.

<doc id="1336470" wikidata="Q338401" url="?curid=1336470" title="Clinker (boat building)">
<text>Clinker-built, also known as lapstrake-built, is a method of boat building in which the edges of longitudinal (lengthwise-running) hull planks overlap each other. Where necessary in larger craft, shorter hull planks can be joined end to end, creating a longer hull plank (strake).

The technique originated in Nordic shipbuilding, and was employed by the Anglo-Saxons, Frisians, and Scandinavians. It was also used in cogs, the other major ship construction type found in Northern Europe in the latter part of the medieval period. Carvel construction—where longitudinal hull planks &quot;abut&quot; edge to edge (instead of lapping)—supplanted clinker construction in large vessels as the demand for capacity surpassed the limits of clinker construction, such as in larger medieval transport ships (hulks).

UNESCO named the Nordic clinker boat tradition to its List of Intangible Cultural Heritage on December 14, 2021, in the first approval of a joint Nordic application.

==Description==
Clinker construction is a boat and ship-building method in which the hull planks overlap and are joined by nails that are driven through the overlap. These fastenings typically go through a metal over which the protruding end of the nail is deformed in a process comparable to riveting the planks together. This gives a distinctive appearance to the outside of the hull as the overlaps are obvious in the stepped nature of the hull surface.

Clinker construction is a shell-first technique (in contrast to the frame-based nature of carvel). The construction sequence begins with the joining of the , and (or ) and setting these in place in the build area. Thereafter, the shape of the hull is determined by the shaping and fitting of the hull planking that forms the waterproof exterior of the hull. Any reinforcing s, s or beams are added after the joining of the hull planks. This may involve completely finishing the exterior planking first, or just some planking may be fitted with, for instance, s being added whilst that part of the hull is accessible before planking is continued.

Medieval clinker construction used iron nails and rovesthe latter often being a distinctive diamond shape. There are less common regional instances of planks being joined with treenails or by sewing, but iron fastening predominated. More modern boats generally use copper nails with an annular rove of the same material.

Historically, particularly in the traditional Nordic tradition, clinker construction most commonly used cleft, or radially split, oak planks. This gives a stronger piece of timber than with sawn materialnot only is the grain continuous along the length of the piece, but the medullary rays are aligned in the same plane as the timber surface, so maximising the strength available. However, this timber conversion method does limit the maximum width of plank to slightly more than one third of the diameter of the tree from which it is splitthe narrowest part (including any pith) and the sapwood are cut off. The slightly uneven surface found on cleft timber is the reason why caulking is laid in the overlap between the hull planks during construction, often using animal hair.

==Examples==
Early examples of clinker-built boats include the longships of the Viking raiders and traders, and the trading cogs of the Hanseatic League. Modern examples of clinker-built boats that are directly descended from those of the early medieval period are seen in the traditional round-bottomed Thames skiffs, the larger (originally) cargo-carrying Norfolk wherries of England, and working craft like the yawls that were once common around the coasts of Britain and Ireland.

== History ==
The term clinker derives from a common Germanic word for &quot;clinch&quot; or &quot;clench&quot;, a word meaning “to fasten together”. 

===Historical context: other systems===
In the first few centuries AD, several boat and ship-building systems existed in Europe. In the Mediterranean, flush-planked hulls were produced by edge-to-edge joining of the hull planking with mortise and tenon joints. This was a shell-first technique, which started with a keel, stem and stern-post, to which planking was added. The hull was then reinforced by the addition of s. The shape of the individual planks generates the shape of the hull. In the Roman-occupied parts of Northern Europe, the Romano-Celtic tradition involved flush-planking that was not joined with mortise and tenon joints but was connected by framing elements. (This may be a building tradition that continued with the bottom planking of the medieval cog and then into the Dutch bottom-based building methods of the 17th century.) The Romano-Celtic method of construction is also a shell-first technique, in that the hull shape is dictated by the shaping of the planks, not by the underlying framing of the finished hull.

===Origins of clinker===
There are precursors of clinker construction. The archaeological remains of a river boat dated to the first two centuries AD (described as Romano-Celtic), found in Pommeroeul in Belgium, had a single that overlapped the underlying plankthough it is not clear how it was fastened. Earlier finds have bevelled lap joints or other similar arrangements that do not have the full lap of clinker. These include the Dover boat and Ferriby 1 (both dating to the middle of the second millennium BC) and the Hjortspring boat (). In these cases, the planks are stitched or sewn together. The Hjortspring boat is built shell-first so suggesting some continuity with the Nordic tradition of clinker construction.
The earliest example of ship and boat building using overlapped planking joined with metal fastenings is in an extended logboat from Björke in Sweden. This dates to . The Nydam boat is an almost complete example of a boat built with clinker construction. It has overlapping planks joined with iron nails driven through the lap. The nails are clenched over s on the inside of the planking. The boat was built shell-first. It dates to .

===Into the medieval===
Though clinker construction is closely associated with Nordic countries, the same technique was used at an early stage in other parts of Northern Europe. The Saxon burial ship at Sutton Hoo in eastern England is an early () example of this sort of ship occurring in the broader Northern European area. Other sites from the 7th century AD include Kvalsund, Norway, Gretstedbro in Jutland and Snape in eastern England. One difference from the Nydam boat is that individual planks in the later period are shorter and narrower. This suggests that large oak trees for ship-building had become a lot less common by the 7th century, so timber of smaller dimensions had to be used.

The 8th, 9th and 10th centuries saw the use of Viking longships for raiding and settlement. Archaeological remains of these clinker-built ships include the Oseberg ship and the Gokstad ship. These show some development from earlier vessels, including a partial which acted as the mast step. As well as these warship types, cargo vessels were built which were less extreme with greater beam and more emphasis on propulsion by sail, together with extra cross-beams to strengthen the hull for greater weight carrying.

The cog is part of another ship-building tradition in Northern Europe that existed at the same time that the purely Nordic-tradition clinker vessels were being built. Though the classic cog construction uses flush planking for the bottom, the sides are constructed in a clinker methodwith the difference that the nails that passed through overlapping planks were simply bent over and driven back into the plank, rather than using roves. 

Clinker-built vessels were constructed as far South as the Basque country; the Newport Medieval Ship is an example of a clinker-built vessel that was built in the Basque region. By the 14th century, clinker-built ships and the cog represented the major construction methods in Northern Europe.

===Introduction of carvel to Northern Europe===
Carvel construction was developed in the Mediterranean around the end of the Classical antiquity period. By the end of the 13th century AD, Mediterranean ships were being built on a skeleton basis, with hull planks being fixed to the frames and not to each other. At the same time, Northern European cogs were voyaging into the Mediterranean. The two maritime technological traditions had differences beyond the hull construction methods. Mediterranean ships were carvel-built, lateen rigged (using more than one mast on larger vessels) and still used side rudders. The visiting cogs had a single square-rigged mast, a stern-post mounted pintle-and-gudgeon rudder and clinker sides. As part of the process of merging these two sets of traditions, carvel-built ships started to arrive in Northern waters. They were soon followed by shipwrights with the skills to build in carvel construction, with the first being built in this region in the late 1430s. The change is still not well understood. The frames of carvel could be made stronger to support the weight of the guns that ships were starting to carry and allowed gun-ports to be cut in the hull. Carvel construction may have solved the shortage of large cleft oak planks from which to make larger clinker vessels. Despite the large-scale move over to carvel construction for large vessels, clinker construction remained prominent throughout Northern Europe.

The Nordic clinker boat tradition was inscribed to the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage on December 14, 2021, as the first joint Nordic application to the list.

==Construction==


===Planking===
In the clinker- (lapstrake-) method of boat building, the edges of longitudinal hull planks overlap each other. Where necessary in larger craft, shorter planks can be joined end to end, creating a longer strake or hull plank.

How this is done is as follows. In building such a boat (e.g., a simple boat), workers assemble and securely set up the keel, stem, deadwoods, sternpost and perhaps transom. In normal practice, this will be the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the garboard, bottom, bilge, topside and sheer strakes are planked up, held together along their ‘lands’ – the areas of overlap between neighbouring strakes – by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge at the end of the strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat&#x27;s passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.

===Timbering or framing out===
How thes steps are done is as follows. Once the shell of planking is assembled, transverse battens of oak, ash, or elm, called timbers, are steam-bent to fit the internal, concave side. As the timbers are bent in, they are fastened to the shell (e.g., via copper-riveting), through the lands of the planking. Alternatively, as on many clinker-built craft, e.g. in Scandinavia and in Thames skiffs and larger working craft like the coble, sawn frames are used, assembled from floors and top timbers, joggled to fit the lands. (Sometimes the timbers in larger archaic craft were also joggled before being steamed in.)

With the timbers all fitted, longitudinal members are bent in. The ones that run on the underside of the thwarts are called risings. They are fastened through the timbers. Bilge keels are often added to the outside of the land on which the boat would lie on a hard surface to stiffen it and protect it from wear. A stringer is usually fitted round the inside of each bilge to strengthen it. In a small boat, this is usually arranged to serve also as a means of retaining the bottom boards. These are removable assemblies, shaped to lie over the bottom timbers and be walked upon. They spread the stresses from the crew&#x27;s weight across the bottom structure.

===Longitudinals===

Inboard of the sheer strake the heavier gunwale is similarly bent in along the line of the sheer. This part of the work is finished by fitting the breast hook and quarter knees. Swivel or crutch chocks are fitted as appropriate to the gunwale, the thwarts fitted down onto the rising and held in position by knees up to the gunwale and perhaps down onto the stringer. The structure of gunwale, rising, thwart and thwart knees greatly stiffens and strengthens the shell and turns it into a boat. There are several ways of fixing the rubbing strake, but, in a clinker boat, it is applied to the outside of the sheer strake.

===Fittings and finishing===

Fittings such as swivels or crutch plate, painter ring, stretchers, keel and stem band are fitted. In a sailing dinghy, there would be more fittings, such as fairleads, horse, shroud plates, mast step, toe straps and so on.

At stages along the way, painters will have been called in to prime the timber, particularly immediately before the timbering is done. The boatbuilder will clean up the inside of the planking and the painter will prime it and probably more, partly because it is easier that way and partly so as to put some preservative on the planking behind the timbers. Similarly, it is best to have the varnishing done after the fittings are fitted but before they are shipped. Thus, the keel band will be shaped and drilled and the screw holes drilled in the wood of keel and stem then the band will be put aside while the varnishing is done.

===Fastenings===
====In general====

The fittings of a clinker boat, as described above (keel, stem band, etc.) are fixed with screws. The planks of the boat may be fastened together in several ways:

* With copper or iron rivets—consisting of a square nail and a dish-shaped washer called a rove. The land is pierced, the nail knocked through from the outside, the rove punched on while the head is held up by a dolly (a small portable anvil, usually of cylindrical shape). The nail is cut off just proud of the rove and the cut end clenched over the rove while the dolly is used to hold the nail in place. In planking up clinker work, one man can hold both dolly and clenching hammer. Although this is common where sawn frames are to be used, boats intended for steamed timbers are usually nailed but not clenched until the timbering out is complete. As timbering is a two-handed job it is more efficient to leave the clenching until help is at hand, and then the helper dollies up, whilst the builder sits inside the hull and clenches up.
* With iron nails—with the pointed nail ends protruding on the inside of the boat, bent over and back into the wood in the form of a hook. This technique, called , used to be found in Scandinavian-built boats, but even iron nails on the lands were usually properly clenched over roves. Nails fastening timbers were sometimes turned over, particularly where removable bottom boards were to rest on the timbers. However, it was possible to tread the bottom boards onto the clenched nails and, where marks were left, gouge out recesses to accommodate the clenched nails.
* With screws—which may be used for fixing the ends of the strakes to the apron and transom. In later times, they also fixed knees to the gunwale and thwarts, but, traditionally, this last would be done with a clench bolt or a large copper nail, clenched.
* With adhesive, notably epoxy—where, traditionally, lands were not glued nor was anything used to bed them. The garboard was bedded onto the hog and keel and the ends of the strakes onto the stem and apron with a mixture of white lead and grease. During the world wars of the 20th century, new techniques and materials were developed by the aircraft industry. By the mid-1950s, these were well infiltrated into the boatbuilding trade. New boats in classes of racing dinghy with clinker hulls were built as glued clinker boats. The basic construction was the same as before, but they were built with decks of ply planking, and the lands were glued with no fastenings, except that the ends and garboards were still screwed to the apron and hog. Since plywood would not split, no timbers were used. Except for a light gunwale and wide rubbing strake, the longitudinals were omitted too, and a short thwart rising and knees were glued to the planking. Their decks made such boats sufficiently stiff. So that the liquid glue could be laid onto the land before the next plank was assembled onto it, the boats were built upside down.

====Of the centre-line====
Where suitable metal was not available, it was possible to use treenails (pronounced trennels), fasteners like clench bolts but made of wood; instead of being clenched, they had a hardwood wedge knocked into each end to spread it, after which, the surplus was then sawn off. In the last few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be fastened together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt used:
* The &quot;screw bolt&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; threaded bolt), with its nut and washer, is by far the most common.
* The &quot;pin bolt&quot; or &quot;cotter bolt&quot;, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt.
* The &quot;clench bolt&quot; has some of the features of a rivet but is usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright&#x27;s use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. 

Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some such bolts may have been of iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened in this way.

==Clinker and carvel compared==
The Vikings used the clinker form of construction to build their longships from split wood planks. Clinker is the most common English term for this construction in both British and American English, though in American English the method is sometimes also known as &quot;lapstrake&quot;; lapboard was used especially before the 20th century to side buildings, where the right angles of the structure lend themselves to quick assembly.

The smoother surface of a carvel boat gives the impression at first sight that it is hydrodynamically more efficient. The lands of the planking are not there to disturb the stream line. This distribution of relative efficiency between the two forms of construction is an illusion because for given hull strength, the clinker boat is lighter.

Additionally, the clinker building method as used by the Vikings created a vessel which could twist and flex relative to the line extending length of the vessel, bow to stern. This gave it an advantage in North Atlantic rollers so long as the vessel was small in overall displacement. Increasing the beam, due to the light nature of the method, did not commensurately increase the vessel&#x27;s survivability under the torsional forces of rolling waves, and greater beam widths may have made the resultant vessels more vulnerable.

There is an upper limit to the size of clinker-built vessels, which could be and was exceeded by several orders of magnitude in later large sailing vessels incorporating carvel-built construction. Clinker building requires relatively wide planking stock compared to carvel, as carvel can employ stealers to reduce plank widths amidships, where their girth is greatest, while clinker planks, needing sufficient lap to accept their clench fastenings, must be wider in proportion to their thickness. In all other areas of construction, including framing, deck, etc., clinker is as capable as carvel. Clinker construction remains to this day a valuable method of construction for small wooden vessels.

<text>The Fairchild F8 is an 8-bit microprocessor system from Fairchild Semiconductor, announced in 1974 and shipped in 1975. The original processor family includes four main 40-pin integrated circuits (ICs); the 3850 CPU which contains the arithmetic logic unit and a scratchpad, the 3851 Program Storage Unit (PSU) which contains of program ROM and handles instruction decoding, and the optional 3852 Dynamic Memory Interface (DMI) or 3853 Static Memory Interface (SMI) to control additional RAM or ROM holding the user programs or data. The 3854 DMA is another optional system that adds direct memory access into the RAM controlled by the 3852.

A minimal system containing a 3850 and 3851 also included four 8-bit data ports, 64 bytes of RAM, and a user program on ROM. This allowed microcontroller applications to be built using just two chips. Doing the same on more traditional designs like the 8080 or 6800 normally required seven. It also meant that any application that did not fit the simple requirements generally required at least three 40-pin ICs, the CPU, PSU and either the 3852 or 3853 along with additional memory chips. As a result of these tradeoffs, the F8 series found widespread use in the microcontroller market but saw less use as a CPU in general-purpose computers. It is relatively obscure today, as its embedded uses rarely revealed the F8 inside.

In 1977, Mostek released a greatly improved single-chip implementation, the Mostek 3870. It merged the 3850 and 3851 into a single chip and reduced the number of power supply voltages needed. More important, Mostek re-arranged the assembly line so user code in ROM was added at the last step, greatly reducing the cost of customizing the design for controller use. The 3870 replaced the original Fairchild versions and was produced by several companies in the US and Europe. In Europe, STMicroelectronics continued producing variations of the design into the mid-1990s.

==History==
===Development===
The F8 story begins with a microprocessor development project at Olympia-Werke, a subsidiary of AEG. Best known as a manufacturer of typewriters, Olympia also had a long history in mechanical calculators, a market that was rapidly converting to electronic versions. Olympia was developing a processor system known as the CP3-F, which General Instrument (GI) had licensed from them. As part of the license agreement, GI sent David Chung, head of GI&#x27;s processor division, to Olympia to liaise with their design team. Shortly after returning to the US, Chung quit GI and moved to Fairchild where he became lead designer of the F8, and is named as the primary inventor on the patent.

Fairchild announced the F8 in September 1974, which led almost immediately to a lawsuit from GI for the misappropriation of trade secrets. As the case dragged on, in February 1976 Fairchild announced a cross-licensing deal with Olympia for the F8, meaning they now had legal access to the original CP3F design and GI&#x27;s lawsuit was neutered, at least in technical details. Very little information on the CP3F is available, but it is widely believed by industry observers that the CP3F is the basis for the F8 design. The court case dragged on into the 1980s, but with no technical issues of note, it had no effect on the sales of the F8.

===Production===
The first engineering samples of the F8 were sent out in April 1975, with volume shipments beginning that fall. At the time, the electronics industry demanded second source arrangements as insurance that the design would not disappear if the designing company went bankrupt or simply lost interest in the design. Fairchild announced such an agreement with Mostek in June 1975. The agreement allowed both companies to continue independent development of the design.

The F8 was introduced at a single-unit price of , making it less expensive than contemporary designs like the Intel 8080 or Motorola 6800 which were at least twice that price. Additionally, the minimal system included four 8-bit input/output ports, a small amount of RAM, and of ROM. Together, they allowed simple applications to be built with only two ICs. In contrast, designs like the 8080 and 6800 required separate dedicated-purpose ICs to provide these functions, normally seven, so an F8 system could be implemented for far less total cost. Offsetting this to some degree was that the program ROM in the PSU was masked onto the chips early in the production process, which required separate production lines for each customer. As a result, setup fees were on the order of .

Although the F8 was marketed as a general-purpose microprocessor, historically it represents the first purpose-designed 8-bit microcontroller, a design that implements a complete computer system on a small number of ICs. Its release had a profound influence on the market, and led to the introduction of dedicated microcontrollers from most other vendors, among them the Intel MCS-48, Motorola MC6801 and MOS 6510, all of which combined various systems formerly left to the circuit board designer to implement. These examples, however, took the process one step further and implemented an entire system on a single IC.

Through the relentless effects of Moore&#x27;s law, it was not long before the 3850 and 3851 could also be implemented in a single IC, which was released as the 3859. The line was also updated with the addition of the 3856, a 3851 with of ROM, and the 3857, a 3856 with additional address lines to access external ROM in addition to the 2 KB internal, eliminating the need for a separate 3853 in many roles.

===3870===
Around the same time that the 3859 was released, Mostek introduced their own version of a single-chip F8, the Mostek 3870. Whereas the 3859 was essentially just a single-chip 3850/3851, the 3870 was a significant advance; it ran up to , double that of the 3859, and required only a single power supply instead of +5 and +12. A much more important change was that custom ROM code was now masked onto the IC as the very last step in the process, so all of the CPUs were identical until the end of the production line. As a result, the mask fees were on the order of , which made it far less expensive to implement. The 3870 was such an advance over the original that Fairchild stopped production of the 3859 and licensed the 3870 for their own sales.

The 3870 was modified with many sub-versions over time. Among the most important of these was the addition of a socket on top of the chip that allowed an EPROM to be plugged in with no other support circuitry required. This eliminated the need for the on-board ROM and allowed customers to produce their own ROM and eliminate the masking fees. Variations also included examples with more ROM or RAM or other more minor changes.

Meanwhile, the cross-license deal with Olympia led to production in Germany by Telefunken, another of AEG&#x27;s many brands. Mostek merged with United Technologies in 1979, who drove the company into the ground and in turn, sold it to Thomson Semiconducteurs in 1985. Thomson merged with SGS in 1987 to form the modern STMicroelectronics, who continued to produce the 3870 into the 1990s. Fairchild also continued producing versions of the 3870 into the 1980s, when they were purchased by National Semiconductor.

Although little-known today, &quot;in 1977 the F8 was the world&#x27;s leading microprocessor in terms of CPU sales.&quot; The design remains somewhat obscure because most of those uses were as embedded microcontrollers where the chip inside the device is rarely identified, as opposed to products like home computers where the CPU inside is better known. Among its few better-known uses were the Fairchild Channel F in 1976, and in the VideoBrain Computer system in 1977. Both were wiped out of the market by the introduction of the Atari 2600 in 1977.

Fairchild also produced a number of engineering and hobby boards using the F8. Kit 1 was a single circuit board with the 3850 CPU, 3851 PSU, and 3853 SMI. The PSU contained a program known as &quot;Fairbug&quot; that could be accessed using a terminal connected to the CPU over its 8-bit I/O port.

The F8 was discontinued in the mid-1980s, with the final last-time purchase by Innovative Data Technology, San Diego, CA for use in their flagship 1/2&quot; 9-track tape drive the TD1050 series used for billing data interchange by telecom operators.

==Description==
===Chip family===
A typical computer system generally requires a CPU, some form of input/output to communicate with the outside world, and memory holding the program code and user data. Typically, I/O would be handled by dedicated chips, and memory would be accessed through an address bus selecting locations in external memory and then returning that data to the CPU over a data bus. Depending on the design, the I/O would communicate with the processor over a dedicated bus, or alternately by placing data in memory and then having the CPU read it. Moving data between all of these different units required additional &quot;glue&quot; circuitry.

The F8 was designed to split these duties up in order to make minimalistic implementations possible. In theory, one could place all of these functions on a single chip, but in the era of 40-pin chips there were simply not enough pins to connect all of these functions up. In particular, implementing an 8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus and another 8-bit I/O bus would leave only 8 more pins for every other function, from power supply and ground to the various clock signals and control lines. Other designs sometimes multiplexed the address and data lines so the same pins could be used for multiple functions, at the cost of requiring more cycles to complete an operation.

The F8 addressed this problem by internalizing some of the functions, like adding a 64-byte scratchpad RAM to the CPU core, while moving others out of the CPU. The best example of this is the minimal system consisting of the 3850 CPU and 3851 PSU. In this case, there is no need for an address bus at all; the RAM is contained in the 3850 and the program ROM in the 3851. It is the PSU that is responsible for keeping track of the program counter, fetching instructions from the internal ROM and feeding them to the 3850 for processing over a dedicated 5-pin instruction bus along with any associated data over the separate 8-bit data bus. This freed up 11 pins that would otherwise be used for additional address lines, which, along with other simplifications and splitting of duty, allowed the CPU to have two complete I/O busses. The 3851 added another two I/O ports, so that a minimal system had four ports in total.

With only 1 KB of ROM and 64 bytes of RAM, only small programs can be managed, but for many systems, like cash registers, gasoline pumps and similar roles, this is more than enough. When a system does have larger requirements, the 3852 or 3853 can be used. These interface with the PSU and contain additional logic for handling their associated memory; for instance, the 3852 had a complete address bus able to access 64 KB of RAM and the circuitry needed to refresh the data. The PSU is still required in these systems, and the program counter and other pointers are maintained separately in all of these chips by reading the same control lines. The main difference between the 3852 and 3853 was that the former included the dynamic RAM refresh circuitry and a 3-pin link to the 3854 DMA controller, while the 3853 removed these and added a new interrupt handler and timer.

The 3854 DMA controller was linked directly to the 3852 RAM controller and did not use the 5-pin control bus found on the other members of the family. It maintained its own address register and a separate byte count, which together indicated the block of memory to be read or written.

===Instruction set architecture===

Internally, the CPU contained an 8-bit accumulator, a 5-bit processor status register, a 6-bit &quot;Indirect Scratchpad Address Register&quot;, or ISAR, and 64 bytes of scratchpad RAM. The first twelve locations within the RAM can be directly accessed and used as secondary accumulators, labeled A through J. The rest of the scratchpad is accessed through the ISAR, a form of indirect addressing.

The 3851/3852/3853 contain the program counter, , along with a secondary program counter, . was referred to as a stack pointer but was not actually used for this, it was used only to store the return addresses from subroutines and lacked any push or pop instructions. If a larger stack is required, this has to be implemented in software. These chips also had a 16-bit Data Counter, , and its associated Data Counter Buffer, . These were used as indexing registers for indirect addressing, although only could be accessed directly and the value in had to be swapped with using a separate instruction.

The instruction set included 70 opcodes encoded in 8-bits. As was typical of the era, many instructions had a variety of addressing modes with some of the modes encoded in the instruction opcode. For instance, the Load Register (LR) instruction came in 14 different versions depending on the origin and destination of the data. The version starting with was followed by two zero bits and then another two bits indicating locations in the scratchpad in locations 12 through 15, so this used opcodes through . was another version of LR, loading the value pointed to by the ISAR. The F8 had a total of eight addressing modes.

The machine instructions can be grouped into six categories: accumulator instructions, branch instructions, memory reference instructions, address register instructions, scratchpad register instruction, miscellaneous instructions (interrupt, input, output, indirect scratchpad register, load, and store).

The F8 ran at , yielding a cycle time. In the F8 the control bus regulates the use of the data bus through the use of timing signals and state controls. The phi clock divides the machine cycle into discrete phases depending on the instruction being executed. The five state control lines are a function of the instruction being executed. The control bus states regulate the control of information in the computer.

==FAIR-BUG==
Fairchild provided development and evaluation kits for the F8, these kits included a 3851A PSU (Program Storage Unit) which contained a monitor in mask ROM, vectored to start at address 0x8080. At power-on, the ROM was entered. The ROM monitor was referred to in Fairchild literature as FAIR-BUG. The FAIR-BUG monitor is a constellation of routines for assisting product development engineers who interacted with FAIR-BUG from a Teletype. Fairchild extended FAIR-BUG as KD-BUG, for use with a keyboard and display.

FAIR-BUG main commands are single ASCII characters drawn from the set {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, R, S, W}. Register and memory locations were keyed in as parameters immediately after the command identifier. For example, the command results in the content of 16 bytes of memory being typed out by the Teletype. FAIR-BUG commands address all memory locations and all registers. These locations can be examined or modified by the programmer.

FAIR-BUG contains five subroutines which are used in processing commands: Input 2 ASCII bytes; Output 1 ASCII byte; Output the string CR, LF, Null; Output 1 ASCII byte; Input 1 ASCII byte from a Parallel Input Device. FAIR-BUG is essentially a random-access management routine for all memory, both RAM and ROM, and all registers including program counter, data counter, and scratchpad. The programmer is given the ability to plant any of the 70+ machine code instructions or operands into memory locations. The programmer can then use the G command to load a specific address into the program counter and execute the routine at that address.

The objective in providing the FAIR-BUG routines in 1975 was to assist engineers in speeding up the creation of applications for the F8 ICs.

<text>King of Kings was a ruling title employed primarily by monarchs based in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Commonly associated with Iran (historically known as Persia in the West), especially the Achaemenid and Sasanian Empires, the title was originally introduced during the Middle Assyrian Empire by King Tukulti-Ninurta I (reigned 1233–1197 BC) and was subsequently used in a number of different kingdoms and empires, including the aforementioned Persia, various Hellenic kingdoms, India, Armenia, Georgia, and Ethiopia.

The title is commonly seen as equivalent to that of Emperor, both titles outranking that of king in prestige, stemming from the late antique Roman and Eastern Roman emperors who saw the &quot;Shahanshahs&quot; of the Sasanian Empire as their equals. The last reigning monarchs to use the title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot;, those of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran (1925–1979), also equated the title with &quot;Emperor&quot;. The rulers of the Ethiopian Empire used the title of (literally &quot;King of Kings&quot;), which was officially translated as &quot;Emperor&quot;. &quot;Sultan of Sultans&quot; is the sultanic equivalent of King of Kings and similarly, Khagan can mean &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;. Later, lesser versions &quot;Amir al-umara&quot; (&quot;Emir of Emirs&quot;) and &quot;Beylerbey&quot; (&quot;Bey of Beys&quot;) appeared.

In Judaism, (&quot;the King of Kings of Kings&quot;) came to be used as a name of God. &quot;King of Kings&quot; () is also used in reference to Jesus Christ several times in the Bible, notably in the First Epistle to Timothy and twice in the Book of Revelation.

== Historical usage ==
=== Ancient India ===

In Ancient India, Sanskrit language words such as &quot;Rājādhirāja&quot; and &quot;Mahārādhirāja&quot; are among the terms that were used for employing the title of the &quot;King of Kings&quot;. These words also occur in Aitareya Aranyaka and other parts of Rigveda (1700 BC – 1100 BC).

The monarchs of the Gupta Empire assumed the imperial title of &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;.

The Gurjara-Pratihara monarch in the tenth century was titled the &quot;Maharajadhiraja of Aryavarta&quot;.

The imperial title of &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; was used by rulers of the Pallava dynasty, the Pala Empire and the Salasthamba dynasty.

The Vijayanagar rulers assumed the imperial title of &quot;Maharajadhiraj&quot;.

The title of King of Kings (&quot;rajadhiraja&quot;) was also common among the rulers of the Kushan Empire.

=== Ancient Mesopotamia ===

==== Assyria and Babylon ====

The title King of Kings was first introduced by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (who reigned between 1233 and 1197 BC) as &quot;šar šarrāni&quot;. The title carried a literal meaning in that a &quot;šar&quot; was traditionally simply the ruler of a city-state. With the formation of the Middle Assyrian Empire, the Assyrian rulers installed themselves as kings over an already present system of kingship in these city-states, becoming literal &quot;kings of kings&quot;. Following Tukulti-Ninurta&#x27;s reign, the title was occasionally used by monarchs of Assyria and Babylon. Later Assyrian rulers to use &quot;šar šarrāni&quot; include Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 669–627 BC). &quot;King of Kings&quot;, as &quot;šar šarrāni&quot;, was among the many titles of the last Neo-Babylonian king, Nabonidus (r. 556–539 BC).

Boastful titles claiming ownership of various things were common throughout ancient Mesopotamian history. For instance, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s great-grandfather Sargon II used the full titulature of &quot;Great King&quot;, &quot;Mighty King&quot;, &quot;King of the Universe&quot;, &quot;King of Assyria&quot;, &quot;King of Babylon&quot;, &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;.

==== Urartu and Media ====
The title of King of Kings occasionally appears in inscriptions of kings of Urartu. Although no evidence exists, it is possible that the title was also used by the rulers of the Median Empire, since its rulers borrowed much of their royal symbolism and protocol from Urartu and elsewhere in Mesopotamia. The Achaemenid Persian variant of the title, , is Median in form which suggests that the Achaemenids may have taken it from the Medes rather than from the Mesopotamians.

An Assyrian-language inscription on a fortification near the fortress of Tušpa mentions King Sarduri I of Urartu as a builder of a wall and a holder of the title &quot;King of Kings&quot;;

=== Iran ===

==== Achaemenid usage ====

The Achaemenid Empire, established in 550 BC after the fall of the Median Empire, rapidly expanded over the course of the sixth century BC. Asia Minor and the Lydian Kingdom were conquered in 546 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, Egypt in 525 BC and the Indus River region in 513 BC. The Achaemenids employed satrapal administration, which became a guarantee of success due to its flexibility and the tolerance of the Achaemenid kings for more-or-less autonomous vassals. The system also had its problems; though some regions became nearly completely autonomous without any fighting (such as Lycia and Cilicia), other regions saw repeated attempts at rebellion and secession. Egypt was a particularly prominent example, frequently rebelling against Achaemenid authority and attempting to crown their own Pharaohs. Though it was eventually defeated, the Great Satraps&#x27; Revolt of 366–360 BC showed the growing structural problems within the Empire.

The Achaemenid Kings used a variety of different titles, prominently Great King and King of Countries, but perhaps the most prominent title was that of King of Kings (rendered in Old Persian), recorded for every Achaemenid king. The full titulature of the king Darius I was &quot;great king, king of kings, king in Persia, king of the countries, Hystaspes&#x27; son, Arsames&#x27; grandson, an Achaemenid&quot;. An inscription in the Armenian city of Van by Xerxes I reads;

==== Parthian and Sasanian usage ====

The standard royal title of the Arsacid (Parthian) kings while in Babylon was &quot;Aršaka šarru&quot; (&quot;Arsacid king&quot;), &quot;King of Kings&quot; (recorded as &quot;šar šarrāni&quot; by contemporary Babylonians) was adopted first by Mithridates I (r. 171–132 BC), though he used it infrequently. The title first began being consistently used by Mithridates I&#x27;s nephew, Mithridates II, who after adopting it in 111 BC used it extensively, even including it in his coinage (as the Greek BAΣIΛEΥΣ BAΣIΛEΩN) until 91 BC. It is possible that Mithridates II&#x27;s, and his successors&#x27;, use of the title was not a revival of the old Achaemenid imperial title (since it was not used until almost a decade after Mithridates II&#x27;s own conquest of Mesopotamia) but actually stemmed from Babylonian scribes who accorded the imperial title of their own ancestors onto the Parthian kings. Regardless of how he came to acquire the title, Mithridates II did undertake conscious steps to be seen as an heir to and restorer of Achaemenid traditions, introducing a crown as the customary headgear on Parthian coins and undertaking several campaigns westwards into former Achaemenid lands.

The title was rendered as &quot;šāhān šāh&quot; in Middle Persian and Parthian and remained in consistent use until the ruling Arsacids were supplanted by the Sasanian dynasty of Ardashir I, creating the Sasanian Empire. Ardashir himself used a new variant of the title, introducing &quot;Shahanshah of the Iranians&quot; (Middle Persian: &quot;šāhān šāh ī ērān&quot;). Ardashir&#x27;s successor Shapur I introduced another variant; &quot;Shahanshah of the Iranians and non-Iranians&quot; (Middle Persian: &quot;šāhān šāh ī ērān ud anērān&quot;), possibly only assumed after Shapur&#x27;s victories against the Roman Empire (which resulted in the incorporation of new non-Iranian lands into the empire). This variant, &quot;Shahanshah of Iranians and non-Iranians&quot;, appear on the coinage of all later Sasanian kings. The final Shahanshah of the Sasanian Empire was Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651 AD). His reign ended with the defeat and conquest of Persia by the Rashidun Caliphate, ending the last pre-Islamic Iranian Empire. The defeat of Yazdegerd and the fall of the Sasanian Empire was a blow to the national sentiment of the Iranians, which was slow to recover. Although attempts were made at restoring the Sasanian Empire, even with Chinese help, these attempts failed and the descendants of Yazdegerd faded into obscurity. The title Shahanshah was criticized by later Muslims, associating it with the Zoroastrian faith and referring to it as &quot;impious&quot;.

==== Buyid revival ====

Following the fall of the Sasanian Empire, Iran was part of the early caliphates. From the 9th century on, parts of Iran were ruled by a series of relatively short-lived Muslim Iranian dynasties; including the Samanids and Saffarids. Although Iranian resentment against the Abbasid Caliphate was common, the resentment materialized as religious and political movements combining old Iranian traditions with new Arabic ones rather than as full-scale revolts. The new dynasties do not appear to have had any interest in re-establishing the empire of the old Shahanshahs, they at no point seriously questioned the suzerainty of the Caliphs and actively promoted Arabic culture. Though the Samanids and the Saffarids also actively promoted the revival of the Persian language, the Samanids remained loyal supporters of the Abbasids and the Saffarids, despite at times being in open rebellion, did not revive any of the old Iranian political structures.

The Shi&#x27;a Buyid dynasty, of Iranian Daylamite origin, came to power in 934 AD through most of the old Iranian heartland. In contrast to earlier dynasties, ruled by emirs and wanting to appease the powerful ruling Abbasid caliphs, the Buyids consciously revived old symbols and practices of the Sasanian Empire. The region of Daylam had resisted the Caliphate since the fall of the Sasanian Empire, attempts at restoring a native Iranian rule built on Iranian traditions had been many, though unsuccessful. Asfar ibn Shiruya, a Zoroastrian and Iranian nationalist, rebelled against the Samanids in 928 AD, intending to put a crown on himself, set up a throne of gold and make war on the Caliph. More prominently, Mardavij, who founded the Ziyarid dynasty, was also Zoroastrian and actively aspired to restore the old empire. He was quoted as promising to destroy the empire of the Arabs and restore the Iranian empire and had a crown identical to the one worn by the Sasanian Khosrow I made for himself. At the time he was murdered by his own Turkic troops, Mardavij was planning a campaign towards Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. Subsequent Ziyarid rulers were Muslim and made no similar attempts.

After the death of Mardavij, many of his troops entered into the service of the founder of the Buyid dynasty, Imad al-Dawla. Finally, the Buyid Emir Panāh Khusraw, better known by his laqab (honorific name) of &quot;&#x27;Adud al-Dawla&quot;, proclaimed himself &quot;Shahanshah&quot; after defeating rebellious relatives and becoming the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty in 978 AD. Those of his successors that likewise exercised full control over all the Buyid emirates would also style themselves as &quot;Shahanshah&quot;.

During times of Buyid infighting, the title became a matter of importance. When a significant portion of Firuz Khusrau&#x27;s (laqab &quot;Jalal al-Dawla&quot;) army rebelled in the 1040s and wished to enthrone the other Buyid Emir Abu Kalijar as ruler over the lands of the entire dynasty, they minted coins in his name with one side bearing the name of the ruling Caliph (Al-Qa&#x27;im) and the other side bearing the inscription &quot;al-Malik al-Adil Shahanshah&quot;. When discussing peace terms, Abu Kalijar in turn addressed Jalal in a letter with the title &quot;Shahanshah&quot;.

When the struggle between Abu Kalijar and Jalal al-Dawla resumed, Jalal, wanting to assert his superiority over Kalijar, made a formal application to Caliph Al-Qa&#x27;im for the usage of the title &quot;Shahanshah&quot;, the first Buyid ruler to do so. It can be assumed that the Caliph agreed (since the title was later used), but its usage by Jalal in a mosque caused outcry at its impious character. Following this, the matter was raised to a body of jurists assembled by the Caliph. Though some dissented, the body as a whole ruled that the usage of &quot;al-Malik al-Adil Shahanshah&quot; was lawful.

=== Hellenic usage ===

Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests ended the Achaemenid Empire and the subsequent division of Alexander&#x27;s own empire resulted in the Seleucid dynasty inheriting the lands formerly associated with the Achaemenid dynasty. Although Alexander himself did not employ any of the old Persian royal titles, instead using his own new title &quot;King of Asia&quot; (), the monarchs of the Seleucid Empire more and more aligned themselves to the Persian political system. The official title of most of the Seleucid kings was &quot;Great King&quot;, which like &quot;King of Kings&quot;, a title of Assyrian origin, was frequently used by the Achaemenid rulers and was intended to demonstrate the supremacy of its holder over other rulers. &quot;Great King&quot; is prominently attested for both Antiochus I (r. 281–261 BC) in the Borsippa Cylinder and for Antiochus III the Great (r. 222–187 BC) throughout his rule.

In the late Seleucid Empire, &quot;King of Kings&quot; even saw a revival, despite the fact that the territory controlled by the Empire was significantly smaller than it had been during the reigns of the early Seleucid kings. The title was evidently quite well known to be associated with the Seleucid king, the usurper Timarchus (active 163–160 BC) called himself &quot;King of Kings&quot; and the title was discussed in sources from outside the empire as well. Some non-Seleucid rulers even assumed the title for themselves, notably in Pontus (especially prominently used under Mithridates VI Eupator). Pharnaces II had appeared as King of Kings in inscriptions and royal coins, and Mithridates Eupator had appeared as King of Kings in an inscription.

It is possible that the Seleucid usage indicates that the title no longer implied complete vassalization of other kings but instead a recognition of suzerainty (since the Seleucids were rapidly losing the loyalty of their vassals at the time).

In the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Caesarion was proclaimed &quot;King of Kings&quot; in the Donations of Alexandria.

=== Armenia ===

After the Parthian Empire under Mithridates II defeated Armenia in 105 BC, the heir to the Armenian throne, Tigranes, was taken hostage and kept at the Parthian court until he bought his freedom in 95 BC (by handing over &quot;seventy valleys&quot; in Atropatene) and assumed the Armenian throne. Tigranes ruled, for a short time in the first century BC, the strongest empire in the Middle East which he had built himself. After conquering Syria in 83 BC, Tigranes assumed the title &quot;King of Kings&quot;. The Armenian kings of the Bagratuni dynasty from the reign of Ashot III 953–977 AD to the dynasty&#x27;s end in 1064 AD revived the title, rendering it as the Persian &quot;Shahanshah&quot;.

===Georgia===
&quot;King of Kings&quot; was revived in the Kingdom of Georgia by King David IV (r. 1089–1125 AD), rendered as &quot;mepet mepe&quot; in Georgian. All subsequent Georgian monarchs, such as Tamar the Great, used the title to describe their rule over all Georgian principalities, vassals and tributaries. Their use of the title probably derived from the ancient Persian title.

=== Palmyra ===
After a successful campaign against the Sasanian Empire in 262 AD, which restored Roman control to territories that had been lost to the &quot;Shahanshah&quot; Shapur I, the ruler of the city of Palmyra, Odaenathus, founded the Palmyrene kingdom. Though a Roman vassal, Odaenathus assumed the title &quot;Mlk Mlk dy Mdnh&quot; (King of Kings and Corrector of the East). Odaenathus son, Herodianus (Hairan I) was acclaimed as his co-monarch, also given the title King of Kings. Usage of the title was probably justified through proclaiming the Palmyrene kingdom as the legitimate successor state of the Hellenic Seleucid empire, which had controlled roughly the same territories near its end. Herodianus was crowned at Antioch, which had been the final Seleucid capital.

Though the same title was used by Odaenathus second son and successor following the deaths of both Odaenathus and Herodianus, Vaballathus and his mother Zenobia soon relinquished it, instead opting for the Roman &quot;Augustus&quot; (&quot;Emperor&quot;) and &quot;Augusta&quot; (&quot;Empress&quot;) respectively.

=== Ethiopia ===
The title King of Kings was used by the rulers of the Aksumite Kingdom since the reign Sembrouthes . The rulers of the Ethiopian Empire, which existed from 1270 to 1974 AD, also used the title of &quot;Nəgusä Nägäst&quot;, sometimes translated to &quot;King of the Kingdom&quot;, but most often equated to &quot;King of Kings&quot; and officially translated to Emperor. Though the Ethiopian Emperors had been literal &quot;Kings of Kings&quot; for the duration of the Empire&#x27;s history, with regional lords using the title of &quot;Nəgus&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), this practice was ended by Haile Selassie (r. 1930–1974 AD), who somewhat paradoxically still retained the use of &quot;Nəgusä Nägäst&quot;.

=== Champa ===
From the 7th century to 15th century, grand rulers of Chamic-speaking confederation of Champa, which existed from 3rd century AD to 1832 in present-day Central Vietnam, employed titles &quot;raja-di-raja&quot; (king of kings) and &quot;pu po tana raya&quot; (king of kings). However, some, such as Vikrantavarman II, held the title of &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; (great king of kings) instead of &quot;raja-di-raja&quot;. The early kings of Champa before decentralization referred themselves by several different titles such as &quot;mahārāja&quot; (great king), e.g. Bhadravarman I (r.380–413), or &quot;campāpr̥thivībhuj&quot; (lord of the land of Champa) used by Kandarpadharma (r. 629–640).

== Feminine forms and usages==
The feminine form of &quot;King of Kings&quot; is &quot;Queen of Queens&quot;, but some female monarchs assumed the title &quot;Queen of Kings&quot;, while others simply used the masculine title &quot;King of Kings&quot;.

=== King of Kings ===
* In the Alupa dynasty, the female monarch Ballamahadevi used the masculine title &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; (&quot;Great King of Kings&quot;).
* In the Bhauma-Kara dynasty, the female monarchs Tribhuvana Mahadevi III, Dandi Mahadevi and Dharma Mahadevi used the masculine title &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; (&quot;Great King of Kings&quot;) alongside the feminine title &quot;paramesvari&quot;.
* In the Kingdom of Georgia, Tamar assumed both the titles of &quot;mepeta-mepe&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;) and &quot;dedopalta-dedopali&quot; (&quot;Queen of Queens&quot;).

=== Queen of Kings ===

* In the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Cleopatra VII was proclaimed &quot;Queen of Kings&quot; in the Donations of Alexandria.
* In the Ethiopian Empire, the title as an empress-regnant of Zewditu was &quot;Nəgəstä Nägäst&quot; (&quot;Queen of Kings&quot;). This title is different from &quot;Nəgusä Nägäst&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;), the title of male emperor, and &quot;Itege&quot;, the title of empress-consort.

=== Queen of Queens ===
* In the empires of Iran, there was the title &quot;bānbishnān bānbishn&quot; (&quot;Queen of Queens&quot;), matched the title &quot;shahanshah&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;) and abbreviated as &quot;bānbishn&quot;. Musa, Boran and Azarmidokht were female monarchs, equivalent in rank to &quot;shahanshahs&quot;.
* Similarly to her mother Tamar, as Georgia&#x27;s monarch, Rusudan assumed the title &quot;Queen of Queens&quot;.
* According to Georgian charters, the title &quot;Queen of Queens&quot; was used for queens of Kartli and Kakheti.
* According to murals in the Gelati Monastery, the title &quot;dedopalta-dedopali&quot; (&quot;Queen of Queens&quot;) was used for queens of Imereti.
* The title &quot;maharaniadhirani&quot; (&quot;Great Queen of Queens&quot;), the feminine form of &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot;, was used for Kam Sundari, the widow of Kameshwar Singh of the Raj Darbhanga.
* Gurju Khatun, the consort of Kaykhusraw II of the Sultanate of Rum, was titled &quot;malikat al-malikāt&quot; (&quot;Queen of Queens&quot;).
* Hürrem Sultan, the consort of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, was addressed in firmans as &quot;malikat el-malikāt&quot; (&quot;Queen of Queens&quot;).

== In religion ==

=== Judaism ===
In Judaism, &quot;Melech Malchei HaMelachim&quot; (&quot;the King of Kings of Kings&quot;) came to be used as a name of God, using the double superlative to put the title one step above the royal title of the Babylonian and Persian kings referred to in the Bible.

=== Christianity ===

&quot;King of Kings&quot; () is used in reference to Jesus Christ in the New Testament: once in the First Epistle to Timothy (6:15) and twice in the Book of Revelation (17:14, 19:11–16);Some Christian realms (Georgia, Armenia and Ethiopia) employed the title and it was part of the motto of the Byzantine Emperors of the Palaiologan period, (&quot;Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn&quot;, literally &quot;King of Kings, ruling over those who rule&quot;). In the Byzantine Empire the word Βασιλεὺς (Basileus), which had meant &quot;king&quot; in ancient times had taken up the meaning of &quot;emperor&quot; instead. Byzantine rulers translated &quot;Basileus&quot; into &quot;Imperator&quot; when using Latin and called other kings &quot;rēx&quot; or &quot;rēgas&quot; (), hellenized forms of the Latin title &quot;rex&quot;. As such, in the Byzantine Empire would have meant &quot;Emperor of Emperors&quot;. The Byzantine rulers only accorded the title of Basileus onto two foreign rulers they considered to be their equals, the Kings of Axum and the &quot;Shahanshahs&quot; of the Sasanian Empire, leading to &quot;King of Kings&quot; being equated to the rank of &quot;Emperor&quot; in the view of the West.

=== Islam ===
Following the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651 AD, the title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot; was sternly criticized in the Muslim world. It was problematic enough that the adoption of &quot;Shahanshah&quot; by the Shia Buyid dynasty in Persia required a body of jurists to agree on its lawfulness and the title itself (both as King of Kings and as the Persian variant &quot;Shahanshah&quot;) is condemned in Sunni hadith, a prominent example being Sahih al-Bukhari Book 73 Hadiths 224 and 225;
The condemnation of the title within the Islamic world may stem from that the concept of God alone being king had been prominent in early Islam. Opposing worldly kingship, the use of &quot;King of Kings&quot; was deemed obnoxious and blasphemous.

== Modern usage ==
===Iran===
After the end of the Buyid dynasty in 1062, the title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot; was used intermittently by rulers of Iran until the modern era. The title, rendered as &quot;Shahinshah&quot;, is used on some of the coins of Alp Arslan (1063–1072), the second sultan of the Seljuk Empire.

The title was adopted by Ismail I (1501–1524), the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Upon his capture of Tabriz in 1501, Ismail proclaimed himself the Shāh of Iran and the Shahanshah of Iran. The term &quot;šāhanšāh-e Irān,&quot; King of Kings of Iran, is richly attested for the Safavid period and for the preceding Timurid period (when it was not in use). Nader Shah, founder of the later Afsharid Dynasty, assumed the title &quot;šāhanšāh&quot; in 1739 to emphasize his superiority over Muhammad Shah of the Mughal Empire in India.

The title &quot;Shahanshah&quot; is also attested for Fath-Ali Shah Qajar of the Qajar dynasty (r. 1797–1834). Fath-Ali&#x27;s reign was noted for its pomp and elaborate court protocol. An 1813/1814 portrait of Fath-Ali contains a poem with the title; &quot;Is this a portrait of a shahanshah, inhabitant of the skies / Or is it the rising of the sun and the image of the moon?&quot;.

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown in 1925, replaced by the Pahlavi dynasty. Both reigning members of this dynasty, Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–1941) and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (r. 1941–1979), before they too were overthrown as part of the Iranian revolution in 1979, used the title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot;. Although Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had reigned as &quot;Shah&quot; for twenty-six years by then, he only took the title of &quot;Shahanshah&quot; on 26 October 1967 in a lavish coronation ceremony held in Tehran. He said that he chose to wait until this moment to assume the title because in his own opinion he &quot;did not deserve it&quot; up until then; he is also recorded as saying that there was &quot;no honour in being Emperor of a poor country&quot; (which he viewed Iran as being until that time). The current head of the exiled house of Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi II, symbolically declared himself &quot;Shahanshah&quot; at the age of 21 after the death of his father in 1980.

===Libya===
In 2008, the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was bestowed with the title of &quot;King of Kings&quot; after a gathering of more than 200 African tribal kings and chiefs endorsed his use of the title on 28 August that year, stating that &quot;We have decided to recognise our brotherly leader as the &#x27;king of kings, sultans, princes, sheikhs and mayors of Africa&quot;. At the meeting, held in the city of Benghazi, Gaddafi was given gifts including a throne, an 18th-century Qur&#x27;an, traditional outfits and ostrich eggs. At the same meeting, Gaddafi urged his guests to put pressure on their own governments and speed the process of moving towards a unified African continent. Gaddafi told those that attended the meeting that &quot;We want an African military to defend Africa, we want a single African currency, we want one African passport to travel within Africa&quot;. The meeting was later referred to as a &quot;bizarre ceremony&quot; in international media.

<text>Wilhelm Adolf Becker (179630 September 1846) was a German classical scholar.

==Biography==
Becker was born in Dresden, the son of German art historian, numismatist and author Wilhelm Gottlieb Becker. At first destined for a commercial life, he was in 1812 sent to the celebrated school at Pforta. In 1816 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he studied under Beck and Hermann. After holding subordinate posts at Zerbst and Meissen, he was in 1842 appointed professor of archaeology at Leipzig. He died at Meissen on 30 September 1846.

==Works==
The works by which Becker is most widely known are the &quot;Gallus, oder, römische Scenen aus der Zeit Augusts: zur genaueren Kenntniss des römischen Privatlebens&quot; (1838, new ed. by Hermann Göll, 1880–1882), and the &quot;Charicles: Bilder altgriechischer Sitte, zur genaueren Kenntniss des griechischen Privatlebens&quot; (1840, new ed. by Göll, 1877–1878). These two books were translated into English by Frederick Metcalfe. They contain a description of the everyday life of the ancient Greeks and Romans, in the form of a romance, with notes and appendices.

A major work is &quot;Handbuch der römischen Alterthümer&quot; (1843–1868), completed after Becker&#x27;s death by Marquardt and Mommsen. Becker&#x27;s other treatises include &quot;De Comicis Romanorum Fabulis&quot;, a treatise on Roman dramatic poetry (1837); &quot;De Romae Veteris Muris atque Portis&quot; (1842); &quot;Die römische Topographie in Röm&quot; (1844); and &quot;Zur römischen Topographie&quot; (1845).

==Life==
He was born on 8 August 1896, at Mengo Palace. He was the fifth son of Kabaka Danieri Basammula-Ekkere Mwanga II Mukasa, Kabaka of Buganda, between 1884 and 1888 and between 1889 and 1897. His mother was Abakyala Evalini Kulabako, of the Ngabi Clan, the fourth of his father&#x27;s sixteen wives. He ascended to the throne in August 1897 following the deposition of his father by British Forces. At the time of his coronation, he was only one year old. He maintained his capital at Mengo Hill. He was educated at Kings College Budo, which was founded in 1906 alongside Daudi, by the British Commissioner and commander in chief of the then Uganda protectorate, George Wilson.

<text>Christian Daniel Beck (22 January 1757 – 13 December 1832) was a German philologist, historian, theologian and antiquarian, one of the most learned men of his time.

==Biography==
Beck was born at Leipzig and studied at Leipzig University, where in 1785 he was appointed professor of Greek and Latin literature. This post he resigned in 1819 in order to take up the professorship of history, but resumed it in 1825. In 1819, he also became editor of the &quot;Allgemeines Reportorium der neuesten in- und ausländischen Litteratur&quot; (Reports on the latest in domestic and foreign literature). He also had the management of the university library, was director of the institute for the deaf and dumb, and filled many educational and municipal offices.

In 1784, he founded a philological society, which grew into a philological seminary, superintended by him until his death. In 1808, he was made a &quot;Hofrath&quot; by the king of Saxony, and in 1820 a knight of the civil order of merit. His philological lectures, in which grammar and criticism were subordinated to history, were attended by hearers from all parts of Germany. He possessed a large and valuable library of 24,000 volumes.

He died at Leipzig on 13 December 1832.

==Works==
He edited a number of classical authors:
*Albinovanus Pedo (1783)
*Pindar and the &quot;Scholia&quot; (1792–1795)
*Aristophanes (with Filippo Invernizzi and Wilhelm Dindorf, 1794, etc.)
*Euripides (1778–1788)
*Apollonius Rhodius (1797)
*Demosthenes &quot;De Pace&quot; (1799)
*Plato (1813–1819)
*Cicero (1795–1807)
*Titus Calpurnius Siculus (1803)

He translated Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Fall of the Roman Republic&quot; and Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot;, and added two volumes to Bauer&#x27;s &quot;Thucydides&quot;. He also wrote on theological and historical subjects, and edited philological and bibliographical journals. Examples of his other works are:

*&quot;Anleitung zur Kenntnis der allgemeinen Welt- und Völkergeschichte&quot; (4 vols., 1787–1807)
*&quot;Commentarii Historici Decretorum Religionis Christianæ et Formulæ Lutheranæ&quot; (1801)

<text>Yuji Hirayama (平山ユージ; born February 23, 1969) is a Japanese rock climber specializing in lead climbing competitions. He won two Lead World Cups, in 1998 (becoming the first Asian climber to win the title) and in 2000. He is notable for being the first-ever climber to onsight an route, and for his various speed records on El Capitan.

== Climbing career==

On November 25, 1999, Hirayama onsighted &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (Castillon, FRA), which gained some historical relevance because it was initially believed to be the world&#x27;s first onsight of an ; however, a few days later, Hirayama himself downgraded it to 8b+, which has become the consensus grading.

On September 29, 2002, Hirayama and Hans Florine climbed &quot;The Nose&quot; in 2:48:55, setting a new speed record.

In 2003, he made the first ascent of a proposed called &quot;Flat Mountain&quot;.

On October 6, 2004, he onsighted the graded &quot;White Zombie&quot; in Baltzola Cave, ESP. This was the world&#x27;s first-ever onsight of an 8c in history.). On 2005 Aug 10, Tomas Mrazek had the 2nd 8c onsight, &quot;Pata Negra&quot; at Rodellar in eastern Spain.

In 2007, his El Capitan &quot;Nose&quot; record was broken by the German brothers Alexander Huber and Thomas Huber. The Hubers climbed &quot;The Nose&quot; on October 8, 2007 in 2 hours, 45 minutes and 45 seconds. On July 2, 2008, Hirayama and Florine retook the record in a time of 2:43:33. Then on October 12, 2008, they lowered the record to 2:37:05.

In 2008, he made the third ascent of boulder problem, &quot;Uma&quot; at Shiobara, and the first ascent of &quot;Ginga&quot; at Kanoto. In 2009, he made the 6th ascent of &quot;Cobra Crack&quot; in Squamish, British Columbia.

In 2012, he freed a multi-pitch route called &quot;Pogulian Do Koduduo&quot; in the Mount Kinabalu National Park in Borneo with one pitch at 9a.

==Business career==
In 2010, Hirayama opened &quot;Climb Park Base Camp&quot;, a climbing gym in Saitama prefecture, Japan.

<text>A personal computer game, also known as a computer game or abbreviated PC game, is a video game played on a personal computer (PC). The term &quot;PC game&quot; has been popularly used since the 1990s referring specifically to games on &quot;Wintel&quot; (Microsoft Windows software/Intel hardware) which has dominated the computer industry since.

Mainframe and minicomputer games are a precursor to personal computer games. Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983. In the 1990s, PC games lost mass market traction to console games on the fifth generation such as the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. They are enjoying a resurgence in popularity since the mid-2000s through digital distribution on online service providers. Personal computers as well as general computer software are considered synonymous with IBM PC compatible systems; while mobile devices – smartphones and tablets, such as those running on Android or iOS platforms – are also PCs in the general sense as opposed to console or arcade machine. Historically, it also included games on systems from Apple Computer, Atari Corporation, Commodore International and others. Microsoft Windows utilizing Direct3D become the most popular operating system for PC games in the 2000s. Games utilizing 3D graphics generally require a form of graphics processing unit, and PC games have been a major influencing factor for the development and marketing of graphics cards. Emulators are able to play games developed for other platforms. The demoscene originated from computer game cracking.

The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market makes precisely assessing its size difficult. PC remains the most important gaming platform with 60% of developers being most interested in developing a game for the platform and 66% of developers currently developing a game for PC. In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion. According to research data provided by Statista in 2020 there were an estimated 1.75 billion PC gamers worldwide, up from 1.5 billion PC gaming users in the previous year. Newzoo reported that the PC gaming sector was the third-largest category across all platforms , with the console sector second-largest, and mobile gaming sector biggest. 2.2 billion video gamers generate US$101.1 billion in revenue, excluding hardware costs. &quot;Digital game revenues will account for $94.4 billion or 87% of the global gaming market. The APAC region was estimated to generate $46.6 billion in 2016, or 47% of total global video game revenues (note, not only &quot;PC&quot; games). China alone accounts for half of APAC&#x27;s revenues (at $24.4 billion), cementing its place as the largest video game market in the world, ahead of the US&#x27;s anticipated market size of $23.5 billion.

== History ==
=== Mainframes and minicomputers ===
&quot;Bertie the Brain&quot; was one of the first game playing machines developed. It was built in 1950 by Josef Kates. It measured more than four meters tall, and was displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition that year.

Although personal computers only became popular with the development of the microprocessor and microcomputer, computer gaming on mainframes and minicomputers had previously already existed. &quot;OXO&quot;, an adaptation of tic-tac-toe for the EDSAC, debuted in 1952. Another pioneer computer game was developed in 1961, when MIT students Martin Graetz and Alan Kotok, with MIT student Steve Russell, developed &quot;Spacewar!&quot; on a PDP-1 mainframe computer used for statistical calculations.

The first generation of computer games were often text-based adventures or interactive fiction, in which the player communicated with the computer by entering commands through a keyboard. An early text-adventure, &quot;Adventure&quot;, was developed for the PDP-11 minicomputer by Will Crowther in 1976, and expanded by Don Woods in 1977. By the 1980s, personal computers had become powerful enough to run games like &quot;Adventure&quot;, but by this time, graphics were beginning to become an important factor in games. Later games combined textual commands with basic graphics, as seen in the SSI Gold Box games such as &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, or &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, for example.

=== Early personal computer games ===
By the late 1970s to early 1980s, games were developed and distributed through hobbyist groups and gaming magazines, such as &quot;Creative Computing&quot; and later &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. These publications provided game code that could be typed into a computer and played, encouraging readers to submit their own software to competitions. Players could modify the BASIC source code of even commercial games. &quot;Microchess&quot; was one of the first games for microcomputers which was sold to the public. First sold in 1977, Microchess eventually sold over 50,000 copies on cassette tape.

As with second-generation video game consoles at the time, early home computer game companies capitalized on successful arcade games at the time with ports or clones of popular arcade video games. By 1982, the top-selling games for the Atari 8-bit computers were ports of &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;Centipede&quot;, while the top-selling game for the TI-99/4A was the &quot;Space Invaders&quot; clone &quot;TI Invaders&quot;. That same year, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was ported to the Atari 8-bit computers, while &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was licensed for the Coleco Adam. In late 1981, Atari, Inc. attempted to take legal action against unauthorized &quot;Pac-Man&quot; clones, despite some of these predating Atari&#x27;s exclusive rights to the home versions of Namco&#x27;s game.

=== Industry crash and aftermath ===

As the American video game market became flooded with poor-quality cartridge games created by numerous companies attempting to enter the market, and overproduction of high-profile releases such as the Atari 2600 adaptations of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; grossly underperformed, the popularity of personal computers for education rose dramatically. In 1983, American consumer interest in console video games dwindled to historical lows, as interest in games on personal computers rose. The effects of the crash were largely limited to the console market, as established companies such as Atari posted record losses over subsequent years. Conversely, the home computer market boomed, as sales of low-cost color computers such as the Commodore 64 rose to record highs and developers such as Electronic Arts benefited from increasing interest in the platform.

=== Growth of home computer games ===
The North American console market experienced a resurgence in the United States with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). In Europe, computer gaming continued to boom for many years after. Computers such as the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro were successful in the European market, where the NES was not as successful despite its monopoly in Japan and North America. The only 8-bit console to have any success in Europe would be the Master System. Meanwhile, in Japan, both consoles and computers became major industries, with the console market dominated by Nintendo and the computer market dominated by NEC&#x27;s PC-88 (1981) and PC-98 (1982). A key difference between Western and Japanese computers at the time was the display resolution, with Japanese systems using a higher resolution of 640x400 to accommodate Japanese text, which in turn affected video game design and allowed more detailed graphics. Japanese computers were also using Yamaha&#x27;s FM synth sound boards from the early 1980s.

To enhance the immersive experience with their unrealistic graphics and electronic sound, early PC games included extras such as the peril-sensitive sunglasses that shipped with &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; or the science fiction novella included with &quot;Elite&quot;. These extras gradually became less common, but many games were still sold in the traditional oversized boxes that used to hold the extra &quot;feelies&quot;. Today, such extras are usually found only in Special Edition versions of games, such as Battle chests from Blizzard.

During the 16-bit era, the Amiga and Atari ST became popular in Europe, the Macintosh and IBM PC compatibles became popular in North America, while the PC-98, X68000, and FM Towns became popular in Japan. The Amiga, X68000 and FM Towns were capable of producing near arcade-quality hardware sprite graphics and sound quality when they first released in the mid-to-late 1980s.

=== Growth of IBM PC compatible games ===
Among launch titles for the IBM Personal Computer (PC) in 1981 was &quot;Microsoft Adventure&quot;, which IBM described as bringing &quot;players into a fantasy world of caves and treasures&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; that year stated that the computer&#x27;s speed and sophistication made it &quot;an excellent gaming device&quot;, and IBM and others sold games like &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;. The PC&#x27;s CGA graphics and speaker sound were poor, however, and most customers bought the powerful but expensive computer for business. One ComputerLand owner estimated in 1983 that a quarter of corporate executives with computers &quot;have a game hidden somewhere in their drawers&quot;, and &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1984 reported that &quot;in offices all over America (more than anyone realizes) executives and managers are playing games on their computers&quot;, but software companies found selling games for the PC difficult; an observer said that year that &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; had sold hundreds of thousands of copies because customers with corporate PCs could claim that it was a &quot;simulation&quot;.

From mid-1985, however, what &quot;Compute!&quot; described as a &quot;wave&quot; of inexpensive IBM PC clones from American and Asian companies, such as the Tandy 1000 and the Leading Edge Model D, caused prices to decline; by the end of 1986, the equivalent to a $1600 real IBM PC with 256K RAM and two disk drives cost as little as $600, lower than the price of the Apple IIc. Consumers began purchasing DOS computers for the home in large numbers. While often purchased to do work on evenings and weekends, clones&#x27; popularity caused consumer-software companies to increase the number of IBM-compatible products, including those developed specifically for the PC as opposed to porting from other computers. Bing Gordon of Electronic Arts reported that customers used computers for games more than one fifth of the time whether purchased for work or a hobby, with many who purchased computers for other reasons finding PC games &quot;a pretty satisfying experience&quot;.

By 1987, the PC market was growing so quickly that the formerly business-only computer had become the largest and fastest-growing, and most important platform for computer game companies. DOS computers dominated the home, supplanting Commodore and Apple. More than a third of games sold in North America were for the PC, twice as many as those for the Apple II and even outselling those for the Commodore 64. With the EGA video card, an inexpensive clone had better graphics and more memory for games than the Commodore or Apple, and the Tandy 1000&#x27;s enhanced graphics, sound, and built-in joystick ports made it the best platform for IBM PC-compatible games before the VGA era.

By 1988, the enormous popularity of the Nintendo Entertainment System had greatly affected the computer-game industry. A Koei executive claimed that &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s success has destroyed the [computer] software entertainment market&quot;. A Mindscape executive agreed, saying that &quot;Unfortunately, its effect has been extremely negative. Without question, Nintendo&#x27;s success has eroded software sales. There&#x27;s been a much greater falling off of disk sales than anyone anticipated.&quot; A third attributed the end of growth in sales of the Commodore 64 to the console, and Trip Hawkins called Nintendo &quot;the last hurrah of the 8-bit world&quot;. Experts were unsure whether it affected 16-bit computer games, but games lost shelf space at computer software stores, and many of the hundreds of computer-game companies went out of business. Hawkins said that while foreign videogame competition increased, &quot;there&#x27;s an increase in product supply without an increase in demand&quot;. He in 1990 had to deny rumors that Electronic Arts would withdraw from computers and only produce console games. By 1993, ASCII Entertainment reported at a Software Publishers Association conference that the market for console games ($5.9 billion in revenue) was 12 times that of the computer-game market ($430 million).

However, computer games did not disappear. The industry hoped that the CD-ROM and other optical storage technology would increase computers&#x27; user friendliness and allow for more sophisticated games. By 1989, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported that &quot;the industry is moving toward heavy use of VGA graphics&quot;. While some games were advertised with VGA support at the start of the year, they usually supported EGA graphics through VGA cards. By the end of 1989, however, most publishers moved to supporting at least 320x200 MCGA, a subset of VGA. VGA gave the PC graphics that outmatched the Amiga. Increasing adoption of the computer mouse, driven partially by the success of adventure games such as the highly successful &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series, and high resolution bitmap displays allowed the industry to include increasingly high-quality graphical interfaces in new releases.

Further improvements to game artwork and audio were made possible with the introduction of FM synthesis sound. Yamaha began manufacturing FM synth boards for computers in the early-mid-1980s, and by 1985, the NEC and FM-7 computers had built-in FM sound. The first PC sound cards, such as AdLib&#x27;s Music Synthesizer Card, soon appeared in 1987. These cards allowed IBM PC compatible computers to produce complex sounds using FM synthesis, where they had previously been limited to simple tones and beeps. However, the rise of the Creative Labs Sound Blaster card, released in 1989, which featured much higher sound quality due to the inclusion of a PCM channel and digital signal processor, led AdLib to file for bankruptcy by 1992. Also in 1989, the FM Towns computer included built-in PCM sound, in addition to a CD-ROM drive and 24-bit color graphics.

In the late 80s and throughout the entire 1990s decade, DOS was one of the most popular gaming platforms in regions where it was officially sold.

By 1990, DOS was 65% of the computer-game market, with the Amiga at 10%; all other computers, including the Apple Macintosh, were below 10% and declining. Although both Apple and IBM tried to avoid customers associating their products with &quot;game machines&quot;, the latter acknowledged that VGA, audio, and joystick options for its PS/1 computer were popular. In 1991, id Software produced an early first-person shooter, &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot;, which was the company&#x27;s first in their line of highly influential games in the genre. There were also several other companies that produced early first-person shooters, such as Arsys Software&#x27;s &quot;Star Cruiser&quot;, which featured fully 3D polygonal graphics in 1988, and Accolade&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Viper&quot; in 1989. Id Software went on to develop &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; in 1992, which helped to popularize the genre, kick-starting a genre that would become one of the highest-selling in modern times. The game was originally distributed through the shareware distribution model, allowing players to try a limited part of the game for free but requiring payment to play the rest, and represented one of the first uses of texture mapping graphics in a popular game, along with &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;.

In December 1992, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported that DOS accounted for 82% of computer-game sales in 1991, compared to Macintosh&#x27;s 8% and Amiga&#x27;s 5%. In response to a reader&#x27;s challenge to find a DOS game that played better than the Amiga version the magazine cited &quot;Wing Commander&quot; and &quot;Civilization&quot;, and added that &quot;The heavy MS-DOS emphasis in &quot;CGW&quot; merely reflects the realities of the market&quot;. A self-reported &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; survey in April 1993 similarly found that 91% of readers primarily used IBM PCs and compatibles for gaming, compared to 6% for Amiga, 3% for Macintosh, and 1% for Atari ST, while a Software Publishers Association study found that 74% of personal computers were IBMs or compatible, 10% Macintosh, 7% Apple II, and 8% other. 51% of IBM or compatible had 386 or faster CPUs.

By 1992, DOS games such as &quot;Links 386 Pro&quot; supported Super VGA graphics. While leading Sega and Nintendo console systems kept their CPU speed at 3–7 MHz, the 486 PC processor ran much faster, allowing it to perform many more calculations per second. The 1993 release of &quot;Doom&quot; on the PC was a breakthrough in 3D graphics, and was soon ported to various game consoles in a general shift toward greater realism. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reiterated in 1994, &quot;we have to advise readers who want a machine that will play most of the games to purchase high-end MS-DOS machines&quot;.

By 1993, PC floppy disk games had a sales volume equivalent to about one-quarter that of console game ROM cartridge sales. A hit PC game typically sold about 250,000 disks at the time, while a hit console game typically sold about cartridges.

By spring 1994, an estimated 24 million US homes (27% of households) had a personal computer. 48% played games on their computer; 40% had the 486 CPU or higher; 35% had CD-ROM drives; and 20% had a sound card. Another survey found that an estimated 2.46 million multimedia computers had internal CD-ROM drives by the end of 1993, an increase of almost 2,000%. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported in April 1994 that some software publishers planned to only distribute on CD as of 1995. CD-ROM had much larger storage capacity than floppies, helped reduce software piracy, and was less expensive to produce. Chris Crawford warned that it was &quot;a data-intensive technology, not a process-intensive one&quot;, tempting developers to emphasize the quantity of digital assets like art and music over the quality of gameplay; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote in 1993 that &quot;publishers may be losing their focus&quot;. While many companies used the additional storage to release poor-quality shovelware collections of older software, or &quot;enhanced&quot; versions of existing ones—often with what the magazine mocked as &quot;amateur acting&quot; in the added audio and video—new games such as &quot;Myst&quot; included many more assets for a richer game experience.

Many companies sold &quot;multimedia upgrade kits&quot; that bundled CD drives, sound cards, and software during the mid-1990s, but device drivers for the new peripherals further depleted scarce RAM. By 1993, PC games required much more memory than other software, often consuming all of conventional memory, while device drivers could go into upper memory with DOS memory managers. Players found modifying codice_1 and codice_2 files for memory management cumbersome and confusing, and each game needed a different configuration. (The game &quot;Les Manley in: Lost in L.A.&quot; satirizes this by depicting two beautiful women exhaust the hero in bed, by requesting that he again explain the difference between extended and expanded memory.) &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; provided technical assistance to its writers to help install games for review, and published sample configuration files. The magazine advised non-technical gamers to purchase commercial memory managers like QEMM and 386MAX and criticized nonstandard software like Origin Systems&#x27;s &quot;infamous late and unlamented Voodoo Memory Manager&quot;, which used unreal mode.

=== Contemporary PC gaming ===


By 1996, the growing popularity of Microsoft Windows simplified device driver and memory management. The success of 3D console titles such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; increased interest in hardware accelerated 3D graphics on PCs, and soon resulted in attempts to produce affordable products with the ATI Rage, Matrox Mystique, S3 ViRGE, and Rendition Vérité. As 3D graphics libraries such as DirectX and OpenGL matured and knocked proprietary interfaces out of the market, these platforms gained greater acceptance in the market, particularly with their demonstrated benefits in games such as &quot;Unreal&quot;. However, major changes to the Microsoft Windows operating system, by then the market leader, made many older DOS-based games unplayable on Windows NT, and later, Windows XP (without using an emulator, such as DOSBox).

The faster graphics accelerators and improving CPU technology resulted in increasing levels of realism in computer games. During this time, the improvements introduced with products such as ATI&#x27;s Radeon R300 and NVidia&#x27;s GeForce 6 series have allowed developers to increase the complexity of modern game engines. PC gaming currently tends strongly toward improvements in 3D graphics.

Unlike the generally accepted push for improved graphical performance, the use of physics engines in computer games has become a matter of debate since announcement and 2005 release of the nVidia PhysX PPU, ostensibly competing with middleware such as the Havok physics engine. Issues such as difficulty in ensuring consistent experiences for all players, and the uncertain benefit of first generation PhysX cards in games such as &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot;, prompted arguments over the value of such technology.

Similarly, many game publishers began to experiment with new forms of marketing. Chief among these alternative strategies is episodic gaming, an adaptation of the older concept of expansion packs, in which game content is provided in smaller quantities but for a proportionally lower price. Titles such as &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot; took advantage of the idea, with mixed results rising from concerns for the amount of content provided for the price.

== Platform characteristics ==
The defining characteristic of the PC platform is the absence of centralized control, an open platform; all other gaming platforms (except Android devices, to an extent) are owned and administered by a single group.

PCs may possess varying processing resources of video gaming systems. Game developers may integrate options to adjust screen resolution, framerate, and anti-aliasing. Increased draw distance and NPCs amount is also possible in open world games. The most common forms of input are the mouse/keyboard combination and gamepads, though touchscreens and motion controllers are also available. The mouse in particular lends players of first-person shooter and real-time strategy games on PC great speed and accuracy. Users may use third-party peripherals. 

The advantages of openness include:
;* Reduced software cost
: Prices are kept down by competition and the absence of platform-holder fees. Games and services are cheaper at every level, and many are free.
;* Increased flexibility
:PC games decades old can be played on modern systems, through emulation software if need be. Conversely, newer games can often be run on older systems by reducing the games&#x27; fidelity, scale or both.
;* Increased innovation
: One does not need to ask for permission to release or update a PC game or to modify an existing one, and the platform&#x27;s hardware and software are constantly evolving. These factors make PC the centre of both hardware and software innovation. By comparison, closed platforms tend to remain much the same throughout their lifespan.

There are also disadvantages, including:
;* Increased complexity
: A PC is a general-purpose tool. Its inner workings are exposed to the owner, and misconfiguration can create enormous problems. Hardware compatibility issues are also possible. Game development is complicated by the wide variety of hardware configurations; developers may be forced to limit their design to run with sub-optimum PC hardware in order to reach a larger PC market, or add a range graphical and other settings to adjust for playability on individual machines, requiring increased development, test, and customer support resources.
;* Increased hardware cost
: PC components are generally sold individually for profit (even if one buys a pre-built machine), whereas the hardware of closed platforms is mass-produced as a single unit and often sold at a smaller profit, or even a loss (with the intention of making profit instead in online service fees and developer kit profits).
;* Reduced security
: It is difficult, and in most situations ultimately impossible, to control the way in which PC hardware and software is used. This leads to far more software piracy and cheating than closed platforms suffer from.

=== Modifications ===

The openness of the PC platform allows players to edit or modify their games and distribute the results over the Internet as &quot;mods&quot;. A healthy mod community greatly increases a game&#x27;s longevity and the most popular mods have driven purchases of their parent game to record heights. It is common for professional developers to release the tools they use to create their games (and sometimes even source code) in order to encourage modding, but if a game is popular enough mods generally arise even without official support.

Mods can compete with official downloadable content however, or even outright redistribute it, and their ability to extend the lifespan of a game can work against its developers&#x27; plans for regular sequels. As game technology has become more complex, it has also become harder to distribute development tools to the public.

Modding has a different connotation on consoles which are typically restricted much more heavily. As publicly released development tools are rare, console mods usually refer to hardware alterations designed to remove restrictions.

=== Digital distribution services ===

PC games are sold predominantly through the Internet, with buyers downloading their new purchase directly to their computer. This approach allows smaller independent developers to compete with large publisher-backed games and avoids the speed and capacity limits of the optical discs which most other gaming platforms rely on.

Valve released the Steam platform for Windows computers in 2003 as a means to distribute Valve-developed video games such as Half-Life 2. It would later see release on the Mac OS X operating system in 2010 and was released on Linux in 2012. By 2011, it controlled 70% of the market for downloadable PC games, with a userbase of about 40 million accounts. Origin, a new version of the Electronic Arts online store, was released in 2011 in order to compete with Steam and other digital distribution platforms on the PC. The period between 2004 and now saw the rise of many digital distribution services on PC, such as Amazon Digital Services, GameStop, GFWL, EA Store, Direct2Drive, GOG.com, and GamersGate.

Digital distribution also slashes the cost of circulation, eliminates stock shortages, allows games to be released worldwide at no additional cost, and allows niche audiences to be reached with ease. However, most digital distribution systems create ownership and customer rights issues by storing access rights on distributor-owned computers. Games confer with these computers over the Internet before launching. This raises the prospect of purchases being lost if the distributor goes out of business or chooses to lock the buyer&#x27;s account, and prevents resale (the ethics of which are a matter of debate).

Valve does not release any sales figures on its Steam service, instead it only provides the data to companies with games on Steam, which they cannot release without permission due to signing a non-disclosure agreement with Valve.
However, Stardock, the previous owner of competing platform Impulse, estimated that, as of 2009, Steam had a 70% share of the digital distribution market for video games. In early 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Steam sales constituted 50–70% of the $4 billion market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of 70% of purchase price, compared with 30% at retail.

== PC gaming technology ==


=== Hardware ===
Modern computer games place great demand on the computer&#x27;s hardware, often requiring a fast central processing unit (CPU) to function properly. CPU manufacturers historically relied mainly on increasing clock rates to improve the performance of their processors, but had begun to move steadily towards multi-core CPUs by 2005. These processors allow the computer to simultaneously process multiple tasks, called threads, allowing the use of more complex graphics, artificial intelligence and in-game physics.

Similarly, 3D games often rely on a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU), which accelerates the process of drawing complex scenes in realtime. GPUs may be an integrated part of the computer&#x27;s motherboard, the most common solution in laptops, or come packaged with a discrete graphics card with a supply of dedicated Video RAM, connected to the motherboard through either an AGP or PCI Express port. It is also possible to use multiple GPUs in a single computer, using technologies such as NVidia&#x27;s Scalable Link Interface and ATI&#x27;s CrossFire.

Sound cards are also available to provide improved audio in computer games. These cards provide improved 3D audio and provide audio enhancement that is generally not available with integrated alternatives, at the cost of marginally lower overall performance. The Creative Labs Sound Blaster line was for many years the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for sound cards, although its popularity dwindled as PC audio became a commodity on modern motherboards.

Physics processing units (PPUs), such as the Nvidia PhysX (formerly AGEIA PhysX) card, are also available to accelerate physics simulations in modern computer games. PPUs allow the computer to process more complex interactions among objects than is achievable using only the CPU, potentially allowing players a much greater degree of control over the world in games designed to use the card.

Virtually all personal computers use a keyboard and mouse for user input, but there are exceptions. During the 1990s, before the keyboard and mouse combination had become the method of choice for PC gaming input peripherals, there were other types of peripherals such as the Mad Catz Panther XL, the First-Person Gaming Assassin 3D, and the Mad Catz Panther, which combined a trackball for looking / aiming, and a joystick for movement. Other common gaming peripherals are a headset for faster communication in online games, joysticks for flight simulators, steering wheels for driving games and gamepads for console-style games.

=== Software ===
Computer games also rely on third-party software such as an operating system (OS), device drivers, libraries and more to run. Today, the vast majority of computer games are designed to run on the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Whereas earlier games written for DOS would include code to communicate directly with hardware, today application programming interfaces (APIs) provide an interface between the game and the OS, simplifying game design. Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX is an API that is widely used by today&#x27;s computer games to communicate with sound and graphics hardware. OpenGL is a cross-platform API for graphics rendering that is also used. The version of the graphics card&#x27;s driver installed can often affect game performance and gameplay. In late 2013, AMD announced Mantle, a low-level API for certain models of AMD graphics cards, allowing for greater performance compared to software-level APIs such as DirectX, as well as simplifying porting to and from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, which are both built upon AMD hardware. It is not unusual for a game company to use a third-party game engine, or third-party libraries for a game&#x27;s AI or physics.

=== Types of gaming ===

==== Local area network gaming ====
Multiplayer gaming was largely limited to local area networks (LANs) before cost-effective broadband Internet access became available, due to their typically higher bandwidth and lower latency than the dial-up services of the time. These advantages allowed more players to join any given computer game, but have persisted today because of the higher latency of most Internet connections and the costs associated with broadband Internet.

LAN gaming typically requires two or more personal computers, a router and sufficient networking cables to connect every computer on the network. Additionally, each computer must have its own copy (or spawn copy) of the game in order to play. Optionally, any LAN may include an external connection to the Internet.

==== Online games ====
Online multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely as a result of increasing broadband adoption among consumers. Affordable high-bandwidth Internet connections allow large numbers of players to play together, and thus have found particular use in massively multiplayer online role-playing games, &quot;Tanarus&quot; and persistent online games such as &quot;World War II Online&quot;.

Although it is possible to participate in online computer games using dial-up modems, broadband Internet connections are generally considered necessary in order to reduce the latency or &quot;lag&quot; between players. Such connections require a broadband-compatible modem connected to the personal computer through a network interface card (generally integrated onto the computer&#x27;s motherboard), optionally separated by a router. Online games require a virtual environment, generally called a &quot;game server&quot;. These virtual servers inter-connect gamers, allowing real time, and often fast-paced action. To meet this subsequent need, Game Server Providers (GSP) have become increasingly more popular over the last half decade. While not required for all gamers, these servers provide a unique &quot;home&quot;, fully customizable, such as additional modifications, settings, etc., giving the end gamers the experience they desire. Today there are over 510,000 game servers hosted in North America alone.

==== Emulation ====

Emulation software, used to run software without the original hardware, are popular for their ability to play legacy video games without the platform for which they were designed. The operating system emulators include DOSBox, a DOS emulator which allows playing games developed originally for this operating system and thus not compatible with a modern-day OS. Console emulators such as Nestopia and MAME are relatively commonplace, although the complexity of modern consoles such as the Xbox or PlayStation makes them far more difficult to emulate, even for the original manufacturers. The most technically advanced consoles that can currently be successfully emulated for commercial games on PC are the PlayStation 2 using PCSX2, and the Nintendo Wii U using the Cemu emulator. A PlayStation 3 emulator named RPCS3 is in development.
Most emulation software mimics a particular hardware architecture, often to an extremely high degree of accuracy. This is particularly the case with classic home computers such as the Commodore 64, whose software often depends on highly sophisticated low-level programming tricks invented by game programmers and the demoscene.

Other projects aim to bring compatibility of older games and its features back to modern platforms such as WineVDM (for running 16-bit games on 64-bit Windows), nGlide (for enabling Glide (API) to other video cards), IPXWrapper (for enabling IPX/SPX based LAN play).

== Controversy ==

PC games have long been a source of controversy, largely due to the depictions of violence that has become commonly associated with video games in general, with much of the criticism stemming from the fact that the PC gaming industry is not as regulated as on other platforms. The debate surrounds the influence of objectionable content on the social development of minors, with organizations such as the American Psychological Association concluding that video game violence increases children&#x27;s aggression, a concern that prompted a further investigation by the Centers for Disease Control in September 2006. Industry groups have responded by noting the responsibility of parents in governing their children&#x27;s activities, while attempts in the United States to control the sale of objectionable games have generally been found unconstitutional.

Video game addiction is another cultural aspect of gaming to draw criticism as it can have a negative influence on health and on social relations. The problem of addiction and its health risks seems to have grown with the rise of massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs). Alongside the social and health problems associated with computer game addiction have grown similar worries about the effect of computer games on education.

<doc id="1336513" wikidata="Q610737" url="?curid=1336513" title="Superior vena cava syndrome">
<text>Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), is a group of symptoms caused by obstruction of the superior vena cava (&quot;SVC&quot;), a short, wide vessel carrying circulating blood into the heart. The majority of cases are caused by malignant tumors within the mediastinum, most commonly lung cancer and non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, directly compressing or invading the SVC wall. Non-malignant causes are increasing in prevalence due to expanding use of intravascular devices (such as permanent central venous catheters and leads for pacemakers and defibrillators), which can result in thrombosis. Other non-malignant causes include benign mediastinal tumors, aortic aneurysm, infections, and fibrosing mediastinitis.

Characteristic features are edema (swelling due to excess fluid) of the face and arms and development of swollen collateral veins on the front of the chest wall. Shortness of breath and coughing are quite common symptoms; difficulty swallowing is reported in 11% of cases, headache in 6% and stridor (a high-pitched wheeze) in 4%. The symptoms are rarely life-threatening, though edema of the epiglottis can make breathing difficult, edema of the brain can cause reduced alertness, and in less than 5% of cases of SVCO, severe neurological symptoms or airway compromise are reported. Resolution of superior vena cava syndrome is directly related to the treatment of the underlying compression.

==Signs and symptoms==
Shortness of breath is the most common symptom, followed by face or arm swelling.

Following are frequent symptoms:
* Difficulty breathing
* Headache
* Facial swelling
* Venous distention in the neck and distended veins in the upper chest and arms
* Migraines (especially if unusual to normal)
* Large decrease in lung capacity
* Facial swelling after bending/laying down
* Upper limb edema
* Lightheadedness
* Cough
* Edema (swelling) of the neck, called the &quot;collar of Stokes&quot;
* Pemberton&#x27;s sign

Superior vena cava syndrome usually presents more gradually with an increase in symptoms over time as malignancies increase in size or invasiveness.

==Cause==

Over 80% of cases are caused by malignant tumors compressing the superior vena cava. Lung cancer, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma, comprises 75–80% of these cases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, comprises 10–15%. Rare malignant causes include Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, metastatic cancers, leukemia, leiomyosarcoma of the mediastinal vessels, and plasmocytoma. Syphilis and tuberculosis have also been known to cause superior vena cava syndrome. SVCS can be caused by invasion or compression by a pathological process or by a deep vein thrombosis in the vein itself, although this latter is less common (approximately 35% due to the use of intravascular devices).

==Diagnosis==
The main techniques of diagnosing SVCS are with chest X-rays (CXR), CT scans, transbronchial needle aspiration at bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy. CXRs often provide the ability to show mediastinal widening and may show the presenting primary cause of SVCS. However, 16% of people with SVC syndrome have a normal chest X-ray. CT scans should be contrast enhanced and be taken on the neck, chest, lower abdomen, and pelvis. They may also show the underlying cause and the extent to which the disease has progressed.

==Treatment==
Several methods of treatment are available, mainly consisting of careful drug therapy and surgery. Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) decrease the inflammatory response to tumor invasion and edema surrounding the tumor. Glucocorticoids are most helpful if the tumor is steroid-responsive, such as lymphomas. In addition, diuretics (such as furosemide) are used to reduce venous return to the heart which relieves the increased pressure.

In an acute setting, endovascular stenting by an interventional radiologist may provide relief of symptoms in as little as 12–24 hours with minimal risks.

Should a patient require assistance with respiration whether it be by bag/valve/mask, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mechanical ventilation, extreme care should be taken. Increased airway pressure will tend to further compress an already compromised SVC and reduce venous return and in turn cardiac output and cerebral and coronary blood flow. Spontaneous respiration should be allowed during endotracheal intubation until sedation allows placement of an ET tube and reduced airway pressures should be employed when possible.

==Prognosis==
Symptoms are usually relieved with radiation therapy within one month of treatment. However, even with treatment, 99% of patients die within two and a half years. This relates to the cancerous causes of SVC found in 90% of cases. The average age of disease onset is 54 years.

<doc id="1336514" wikidata="Q1580324" url="?curid=1336514" title="Mostek">
<text>Mostek Corporation was a semiconductor integrated circuit manufacturer, founded in 1969 by L. J. Sevin, Louay E. Sharif, Richard L. Petritz and other ex-employees of Texas Instruments. At its peak in the late 1970s, Mostek held an 85% market share of the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) memory chip market worldwide, until being eclipsed by lower-priced Japanese DRAM manufacturers who were accused of dumping memory on the market.

In 1979, soon after its market peak, Mostek was purchased by United Technologies Corporation for . In 1985, after several years of red ink and declining market share, UTC closed Mostek completely and sold it for to the French electronics firm Thomson-CSF, which later spun it off into STMicroelectronics.

==Early Products==

Mostek&#x27;s first contract was from Burroughs, a $400 contract for circuit design. Initially Mostek products were manufactured in Worcester, Massachusetts in cooperation with Sprague Electric, however by 1974 most of its manufacturing was done at their headquarters in Carrollton, Texas. The first design to be produced was the MK1001, a simple barrel shifter chip made using an aluminium-gate PMOS process. This was followed by a 1K DRAM, the MK4006, designed by Vern McKinney, that was manufactured in their Carrollton facility.

Mostek had been working with Sprague Electric to develop the ion implantation process which provided much better control of doping profiles, especially in lowering enhancement-mode transistor threshold voltage and providing depletion-load transistors. Using ion implantation, Mostek became an early leader in MOS manufacturing technology, while their competition was still mostly using the older bipolar technology. The resulting increased speed and lower cost of the MK4006 memory chip made it the runaway favorite to IBM and other mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers (cf. BUNCH, Digital Equipment Corporation).

In 1970 Busicom, a Japanese adding machine manufacturer, approached Intel and Mostek with a proposal to introduce a new electronic calculator line. Intel responded first, providing them with the Intel 4004, which they used in a line of desktop calculators. Mostek&#x27;s device took longer to develop but was the world&#x27;s first single chip calculator, the MK6010, used for the Busicom LE-120A which went on the market in 1971 and was the smallest calculator available for some time. Hewlett-Packard also contracted with Mostek for design and production of chips for their HP-35 and HP-45 calculators.

==World leader in DRAM==

Mostek co-founder Robert Proebsting invented DRAM address multiplexing with the MK4096 4096 X 1 bit DRAM introduced in 1973. Address multiplexing reduced cost and board space by fitting a 4K DRAM into a 16 pin package, while competitors used a bulky and relatively expensive 22 pin package. Competitors derided the Mostek approach as unnecessarily complex, but Proebsting understood the future roadmap for DRAM memories would benefit greatly if only one new pin were needed for every 4X increase in memory size, instead of the two pins per 4X for the evolutionary approach.

Computer manufacturers found address multiplexing to be a compelling feature as they saw that a future 64K DRAM chip would save 8 pins if implemented with address multiplexing and subsequent generations even more. Per pin costs are a major cost driver in integrated circuits, plus the multiplexed approach used less silicon area, which further reduces chip cost. The MK4096 was produced using an NMOS aluminum-gate process with an added interconnect layer of polysilicon (dubbed the SPIN process). The fear, uncertainty and doubt put up by the competition regarding address multiplexing was dispelled by the actual performance of the MK4096 which proved solid and robust in all types of computer memory designs.

In 1976 Mostek introduced the silicon-gate MK4027 (an improved version of the metal-gated MK4096), and in 1977 the MK4116 16K double-poly silicon-gate DRAM designed by Paul Schroeder and Robert Proebsting (Schroeder later left Mostek to co-found Inmos). The MK4116 achieved greater than 75% worldwide DRAM market share. The MK4027 and MK4116 were reverse-engineered by MOSAID and successfully cloned by many companies, both USA and overseas-based.

The 64K generation of DRAMs required a transition from 12V &amp; +/−5V to 5V-only operation, in order to free the +12V and −5V pins for use as addresses (the +5V and ground pins were assigned to pins 8 and 16, respectively, rather than the 16-pin TTL DIP standard of pin 8 for ground and pin 16 for +5V). While most competitors took a conservative approach by simply shrinking (scaling) their 64Ks, Mostek undertook a major redesign which incorporated forward-looking features (such as controlled pre-charge current) that were not necessary at the 64K level and delayed entry into the market.

Mostek&#x27;s DRAM legacy is exemplified in the MK4116, MK4164 and MK41256. &quot;By four&quot; DRAM was a simple adaptation of the MK4116/MK4164/MK41256 technology, utilizing a larger package to accommodate the additional data bits and multiplexing the data in/out pins as well; the basic *RAS, *CAS, *WRITE and multiplexed address bus concept was retained intact.

==World leader in telecommunications products==
Mostek enjoyed many years of mastery of the international market for telecommunications products. Their product line included telephone tone and pulse dialers, touchtone decoders, counters, top-octave generators (used by Hammond, Baldwin, and others), CODECs, watch circuits, and a host of custom products for a variety of customers. The products used the simple aluminium-gate PMOS (&amp; later aluminium-gate CMOS) process and helped maintain Mostek&#x27;s cash flow through intense DRAM competition, and other semiconductor market pressures. In 1975 a smoky fire in the wafer fab closed it for several months and production of some critical products was shifted to a friendly fab (Synertek) in Silicon Valley.

Several employees played a key role in the Telecommunications and Industrial Products Department. Bob Paluck headed the department and later Dave Seeler, assisted by Mike Callahan, Charles Johnson, William Bradley, Robert C. Jones, Bob Banks, Ted Lewis, Darin Kincaid, and William Cummings. Telecom marketing was handled by John Crago, Randall Hopkins, and Henry Wasik. Lewis and Bradley were designated as key employees after the United Technologies purchase.

Bradley designed all of the custom products based on the single-chip-calculator platform, as well as the code for the wristwatch chips produced by Mostek for Bulova and other customers. For a short while, Paluck headed a joint venture called Mostek Hong Kong, a collaboration with Bulova for the production of high-end wristwatches based on Mostek designs. Bradley was an employee of that joint venture. Paluck left Mostek to work with Sevin Rosen Funds and Convex Computer. As Mostek&#x27;s focus was shifted to its DRAM products, the industrial and telecommunications products were ignored and their market share vanished.

==Microprocessor second sourcing deals==
With this foundation in calculator chips and high volume DRAM production, Mostek gained a reputation as a leading semiconductor &quot;fabrication house&quot; (fab) in the early 1970s.

=== MK5065 ===
In 1974 Mostek introduced the MK5065, an 8-bit PMOS microprocessor, with 51 instructions whose execution times range from 3 to 16 μs. Architectural features included multiple nested indirect addressing and three register sets (each consisting of an accumulator, a program counter and a carry/link bit) which could be used for interrupt processing or for subroutines. Bill Mensch was one of the engineers who had actually designed the 5065 at Motorola for Olivetti.

=== MK3870 ===

A more popular product was the MK3870, which combined the two-chip Fairchild F8 (3850 + 3851) into a single chip, introduced in 1977. William Bradley designed a host of custom products based on the 3870. Fairchild later licensed the 3870 back from Mostek. Mostek also produced ROM chips on demand, as well as the chips powering the Hammond electronic organ.

=== MK3880===

During the introduction of the Z80, Zilog needed a production partner while they got their own fabs set up. They first signed a production agreement with Synertek, but the company later demanded they sign a second source deal, allowing Synertek to produce and sell the design on their own. Zilog refused, so the agreement was broken. Zilog then selected Mostek as the only other company capable of building a +5V device (as opposed to +5 and +12). Mostek had developed advanced layout methods which were applied to the Z80, resulting in the device being shrunk by 20%. Mostek was able to sign a second source deal for what it called the MK3880. The Z80 eventually became the most popular microcomputer family, and was used in millions of embedded devices as well as in many home computers and computers using the de facto standard CP/M operating system, such as the Osborne, Kaypro, and TRS-80 models.

=== Others ===
Mostek sought new microprocessor partners and negotiated deals with Intel to gain second sourcing rights to the Intel 8086 microprocessor family and future x86 designs and with Motorola for rights to the Motorola 68000 and VME. Mostek thus secured rights to every microprocessor family that would be important for the next 25 years. The Intel x86 microprocessors would go on to become the brains for the IBM PC, while the Motorola 68000 would become the heart of the Apple Macintosh line. However, as with its telecom business, Mostek chose not to aggressively follow-up its entry into microprocessors—instead increasing its concentration on DRAMs.

==Decline in the face of Asian competition==
Mostek was bought by United Technologies (UTC) in 1979 for US$345M to prevent an unfriendly takeover from Gould at the 10th anniversary of the company&#x27;s founding, when a large block of stock options controlled by Sprague Electric became vested. The leadership UTC chose for its semiconductor division did not appreciate the up-front investment required or the long time for ROI.

UTC at first invested hundreds of millions to expand Mostek, then hundreds of millions more trying to keep the company going during the various semiconductor and videogame crashes of the early 1980s.
UTC sacrificed Mostek&#x27;s leadership position in some markets, focusing instead on the highly competitive (and eventually unprofitable) DRAM business.

Unfortunately the DRAM marketplace was the beachhead where Japanese firms would make their successful assault on the global semiconductor market. In 1985, when 64K DRAM memory chips were the most common memory chips used in computers, and when more than 60 percent of those chips were produced by Japanese companies, semiconductor makers in the United States (including Mostek spin-off Micron) accused Japanese companies of export dumping for the purpose of driving makers in the United States out of the commodity memory chip business. Prices for the 64K product plummeted to as low as 35 cents apiece from $3.50 within 18 months, with disastrous financial consequences for U.S. chip makers. On 4 December 1985 the US Commerce Department’s International Trade Administration ruled in favor of the complaint, but the ruling was too late to save Mostek.

Mostek&#x27;s 256K DRAM had been delayed by a then-ambitious double-layer metallization design. In 1985, when the price for 64Ks had collapsed and 256K prices were already under $10, Mostek&#x27;s 256K device was still not ready for volume production, and the company suffered heavy losses. Eventually, on 17 October 1985, UTC gave up, closed Mostek completely, and days later sold it to Thomson-CSF, a French Government electronics company, for a mere $71 million. By 1986, all United States chip makers, with the exception of Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Motorola and IBM had stopped making DRAM. As of 1990, they represented less than 10% of the world&#x27;s supply. 

==Afterword==

UTC closed Mostek completely in 1985 and sold it for to the French electronics firm Thomson-CSF. Thomson called back only about 20% of the workforce in an attempt to return Mostek to profitability. Thomson&#x27;s Mostek operations continued under the name TCMC (Thomson Components - Mostek Corp).

In 1987 Thomson spun-off and merged its semiconductor operations, including Mostek, with the Italian SGS-ATES to become STMicroelectronics, based in Geneva, Switzerland. At the time of the merger the new corporation was named SGS-Thomson but took its current name in May 1998 following Thomson&#x27;s sale of its shares. Mostek&#x27;s intellectual property portfolio, which included many foundational patents in DRAM technology, turned out to be highly valuable. STM started a series of lawsuits to collect royalties and between 1987 and 1993 made $450 million on these licenses alone. 

STM continued operations at the Carrollton site for several years. A small residual operation is located in Coppell, Tx. A group of Mostek veterans gathers for a yearly lunch in February under the name &quot;MostekLives!&quot;.

==Spinoffs==
Jerry Rogers founded Cyrix in 1988 to capitalize on the Mostek second source agreement that allowed any 80x86 processor to be legally copied, which Intel attempted to stop via lawsuits. Eventually, after losing many legal battles, Intel simply changed the name of the 80586 to the Pentium, thereby ending the agreement.

Micron Technology was a very successful spinoff founded by a handful of Mostek employees, including Ward Parkinson, Dennis Wilson, and Doug Pitman.

Sevin Rosen Funds co-founded by LJ Sevin funded Compaq Computers, Cyrix, Convex Computers and more.

Bob Paluck started Convex Computers in 1982. Vin Prothro started Dallas Semiconductor in ca 1984. Mike Callahan started Crystal Semiconductor in ca 1979. Charles Johnson started SRX in ca 1981.

==Mostek Manufacturing==
As a full IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) Mostek had a full array of divisions including Design, Photomask, Wafer Fab, Test, Assembly/Packaging, Product Engineering, Quality/Reliability, Sales/Marketing. For nearly all of its existence Bob Palmer was Senior Vice-President over all these divisions.

==Photomask==
Jim Piker founded and managed Mostek&#x27;s in-house Photomask operations. The photomask step and repeat techniques eventually were copied for wafer fabrication ca 1968.

==Wafer Fabrication==
Mostek&#x27;s first wafer fab was provided by Sprague at its plant in Worcester, Ma near Boston. In ca 1973, Mary Ann Potter founded and managed Fab1 at 1215 Crosby Rd in Carrollton, Tx, a NW suburb of Dallas, in a converted warehouse around the corner from Mostek&#x27;s corporate office on Upfield St.

Also at the main Crosby Rd site: a small R&amp;D fab was started ca 1974 which eventually became Fab3, Fab2 was founded ca 1975, Fab4 (in a new building) ca 1978, Fab5 in 1979, Fab6 ca 1984, and a Colorado Springs Fab ca 1984.

==Test==
Testing and Burn-In were located at the main site on Crosby Rd.

==Assembly/Packaging==
Mostek&#x27;s main Packaging operations were in Panang, Malaysia.

<text>The Indian plate (or India plate) is a minor tectonic plate straddling the equator in the Eastern Hemisphere. Originally a part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, the Indian plate broke away from the other fragments of Gondwana and began moving north, carrying Insular India with it. It was once fused with the adjacent Australian plate to form a single Indo-Australian plate; recent studies suggest that India and Australia have been separate plates for at least 3 million years. The Indian plate includes most of modern South Asia (the Indian subcontinent) and a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China, western Indonesia, and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan, and Balochistan in Pakistan.

==Plate movements==
Until roughly , the Indian plate formed part of the supercontinent, Gondwana, together with modern Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and South America. Gondwana fragmented as these continents drifted apart at different velocities; a process which led to the opening of the Indian Ocean.

In the late Cretaceous approximately , and subsequent to the splitting from Gondwana of conjoined Madagascar and India, the Indian plate split from Madagascar and formed Insular India. It began moving north, at about per year, and is believed to have begun colliding with Asia as early as , in the Eocene epoch of the Cenozoic. However, some authors suggest the collision between India and Eurasia occurred much later, around . If the collision occurred between 55 and 50 Mya, the Indian plate would have covered a distance of , moving more quickly than any other known plate. In 2012, paleomagnetic data from the Greater Himalaya was used to propose two collisions to reconcile the discrepancy between the amount of crustal shortening in the Himalaya (~) and the amount of convergence between India and Asia (~). These authors propose a continental fragment of northern Gondwana rifted from India, traveled northward, and initiated the &quot;soft collision&quot; between the Greater Himalaya and Asia at ~50 Mya. This was followed by the &quot;hard collision&quot; between India and Asia occurred at ~25 Mya. Subduction of the resulting ocean basin that formed between the Greater Himalayan fragment and India explains the apparent discrepancy between the crustal shortening estimates in the Himalaya and paleomagnetic data from India and Asia. However, the proposed ocean basin was not constrained by paleomagnetic data from the key time interval of ~120 Mya to ~60 Mya. New paleomagnetic results of this critical time interval from southern Tibet do not support this Greater Indian Ocean basin hypothesis and the associated dual collision model.

In 2007, German geologists suggested the reason the Indian plate moved so quickly is that it is only half as thick () as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwana. The mantle plume that once broke up Gondwana might also have melted the lower part of the Indian subcontinent, which allowed it to move both more quickly and farther than the other parts. The remains of this plume today form the Marion hotspot (Prince Edward Islands), the Kerguelen hotspot, and the Réunion hotspots. As India moved north, it is possible the thickness of the Indian plate degenerated further as it passed over the hotspots and magmatic extrusions associated with the Deccan and Rajmahal Traps. The massive amounts of volcanic gases released during the passage of the Indian plate over the hotspots have been theorised to have played a role in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, generally held to be due to a large asteroid impact.

In 2020, however, geologists at the University of Oxford and the Alfred Wegener Institute found that new plate-motion models displayed increased movement speeds in all mid-ocean ridges during the late Cretaceous, a result irreconcilable to current theories of plate tectonics and a refutation of the plume-push hypothesis. Pérez-Díaz concludes that the accelerated movement of the Indian plate is an illusion wrought by large errors in geomagnetic reversal timing around the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, and that a recalibration of the time scale shows no such acceleration exists.

The collision with the Eurasian plate along the boundary between India and Nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalaya Mountains, as sediment bunched up like earth before a plow.

The Indian plate is currently moving north-east at per year, while the Eurasian plate is moving north at only per year. This is causing the Eurasian plate to deform, and the Indian plate to compress at a rate of per year.

==Geography==
The westerly side of the Indian plate is a transform boundary with the Arabian plate called the Owen fracture zone, and a divergent boundary with the African plate called the Central Indian Ridge (CIR). The northerly side of the plate is a convergent boundary with the Eurasian plate forming the Himalaya and Hindu Kush mountains, called the Main Himalayan Thrust.

<doc id="1336519" wikidata="Q907160" url="?curid=1336519" title="Leuprorelin">
<text>Leuprorelin, also known as leuprolide, is a manufactured version of a hormone used to treat prostate cancer, breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, for early puberty, or as part of transgender hormone therapy. It is given by injection into a muscle or under the skin.
Leuprorelin is in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue family of medications. It works by decreasing gonadotropins and therefore decreasing testosterone and estradiol. Common side effects include hot flashes, unstable mood, trouble sleeping, headaches, and pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include high blood sugar, allergic reactions, and problems with the pituitary gland. Use during pregnancy may harm foetal development.
Leuprorelin was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is sold under the brand name Lupron among others.

==Medical use==
Leuprorelin may be used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer. It may also be used for estrogen-dependent conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids.

It may be used for precocious puberty in both males and females, and to prevent premature ovulation in cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). This use is controversial since the Lupron label advises against using the drug when one is considering pregnancy, due to a risk of birth defects.

It may be used to reduce the risk of premature ovarian failure in women receiving cyclophosphamide for chemotherapy.

Along with triptorelin and goserelin, it has been used to delay puberty in transgender youth until they are old enough to begin hormone replacement therapy. Researchers have recommended puberty blockers after age 12, when the person has developed to Tanner stages 2–3, and then cross-sex hormones treatment at age 16. This use of the drug is off-label, however, not having been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and without data on long-term effects of this use.

They are also sometimes used as alternatives to antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate for suppressing testosterone production in transgender women. It also is used for suppressing estrogen production in transgender men.

It is considered a possible treatment for paraphilias. Leuprorelin has been tested as a treatment for reducing sexual urges in pedophiles and other cases of paraphilia.

==Side effects==
Common side effects of leuprorelin injection include redness/burning/stinging/pain/bruising at the injection site, hot flashes (flushing), increased sweating, night sweats, tiredness, headache, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, testicular shrinkage, constipation, stomach pain, breast swelling or tenderness, acne, joint/muscle aches or pain, trouble sleeping (insomnia), reduced sexual interest, vaginal discomfort/dryness/itching/discharge, vaginal bleeding, swelling of the ankles/feet, increased urination at night, dizziness, breakthrough bleeding in a female child during the first two months of leuprorelin treatment, weakness, chills, clammy skin, skin redness, itching, or scaling, testicle pain, impotence, depression, or memory problems. The rates of gynecomastia with leuprorelin have been found to range from 3 to 16%.

A cohort of women that were prescribed leuprorelin to delay precocious puberty as children has developed osteoporosis and brittle teeth at an unexpected rate; However, the FDA has not established that these conditions were caused by leuprorelin.

===Lupron &quot;flare&quot;===
During the initial phase of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy in individuals assigned male at birth, there is a notable phenomenon known as the &quot;flare.&quot; This occurs when testosterone levels temporarily surge by approximately 50% within the first 1 to 2 weeks of therapy. This increase is a response to the initial stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the LHRH agonist, leading to a rise in testosterone levels before they begin to decrease as intended. For individuals receiving LHRH agonists as part of gender-affirming care, this temporary increase in testosterone can be particularly distressing, exacerbating gender dysphoria and discomfort. To manage and mitigate these effects, healthcare providers often prescribe antiandrogens during this phase to help block the unwanted increase in testosterone and alleviate the associated distress.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue acting as an agonist at pituitary GnRH receptors. GnRH receptor agonists initially increase the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary and increased serum estradiol and testosterone levels via the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis). However, normal functioning of this axis requires pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. Continuous exposure to an agonist such as leuprorelin for several weeks causes pituitary GnRH receptors to become desensitised and no longer responsive. This desensitisation is the objective of leuprorelin therapy because it ultimately reduces LH and FSH secretion, leading to hypogonadism and a dramatic reduction in estradiol and testosterone levels regardless of sex.

===Available forms===
Leuprorelin is available in the following forms, among others:
* Short-acting daily intramuscular injection (Lupron)
* Long-acting depot intramuscular injection (Lupron Depot)
* Long-acting depot subcutaneous injection (Eligard)
* Long-acting subcutaneous injection (Fensolvi)
* Long-acting subcutaneous implant (Viadur)
* Long-acting leuprolide mesylate (Camcevi) for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
* Leuprolide acetate and norethindrone acetate co-packaged pack (Lupaneta Pack)

==Chemistry==
The peptide sequence is Pyr-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr--Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt (Pyr = -pyroglutamyl).

==History==
Leuprorelin was discovered and first patented in 1973 and was introduced for medical use in 1985. It was initially marketed only for daily injection, but a depot injection formulation was introduced in 1989.

===Approvals===
* Lupron injection was approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 9 April 1985.
* Lupron depot for monthly intramuscular injection was approved by the FDA for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 26 January 1989.
* Viadur was approved by the FDA for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 6 March 2000.
* Eligard was approved by the FDA for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 24 January 2002.
* Fensolvi was approved by the FDA for children with central precocious puberty on 4 May 2020.

==Society and culture==

=== Legal status ===
On 24 March 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Camcevi, intended for the treatment of the cancer of the prostate in adult men when the cancer is &quot;hormone-dependent&quot;, which means that it responds to treatments that reduce the levels of the hormone testosterone. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Leuprorelin was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2022.

===Names===
Leuprorelin is the generic name of the drug and its and , while leuprorelin acetate is its and , leuprolide acetate is its and , leuprorelina is its , and leuproréline is its . It is also known by its developmental code names A-43818, Abbott-43818, DC-2-269, and TAP-144.

Leuprorelin is marketed by Bayer AG under the brand name Viadur, by Tolmar under the brand names Eligard and Fensolvi, and by TAP Pharmaceuticals (1985–2008), by Varian Pharmed( Previously named Varian Darou Pajooh) under the brand name Leupromer and Abbott Laboratories (2008–present) under the brand name Lupron.

===Legal History===
In October 2001, the US Department of Justice, states attorneys general, and TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, settled criminal and civil charges against TAP related to federal and state medicare fraud and illegal marketing of the drug leuprorelin. TAP paid a total of $875 million, which was a record high at the time. The $875 million settlement broke down to $290 million for violating the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, $559.5 million to settle federal fraud charges for overcharging Medicare, and $25.5 million reimbursement to 50 states and Washington, D.C., for filing false claims with the states&#x27; Medicaid programs. The case arose under the False Claims Act with claims filed by Douglas Durand, a former TAP vice president of sales, and Joseph Gerstein, a doctor at Tufts University&#x27;s HMO practice. Durand, Gerstein, and Tufts shared $95 million of the settlement.

There have since been various suits concerning leuprorelin use, none successful. They either concern the oversubscription of the drug or undue warning about the side effects. Between 2010 and 2013, the FDA updated the Lupron drug label to include new safety information on the risk of thromboembolism, loss of bone density and convulsions. The FDA then asserted that the benefits of leuprorelin outweigh its risks when used according to its approved labeling. Since 2017, the FDA has been evaluating leuprorelin&#x27;s connection to pain and discomfort in musculoskeletal and connective tissue.

==Research==
, leuprorelin was under investigation for possible use in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

A by mouth formulation of leuprorelin is under development for the treatment of endometriosis. It was also under development for the treatment of precocious puberty, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids, but development for these uses was discontinued. The formulation has the tentative brand name Ovarest. As of July 2018, it is in phase II clinical trials for endometriosis.

==Veterinary use==
Leuprorelin is frequently used in ferrets for the treatment of adrenal disease. Its use has been reported in a ferret with concurrent primary hyperaldosteronism, and one with concurrent diabetes mellitus. It is also used to treat pet parrots with chronic egg laying behavior.

The name refers to Haman, the villain in the Purim story. In Hebrew, hamantashen are also known as (oznei Haman), meaning &quot;Haman&#x27;s ears&quot;. &quot;Haman&#x27;s ears&quot; also refers to a Sephardic Purim pastry, &quot;Orejas de Haman&quot;, thought to originate in Spain and Italy, that is made by frying twisted or rolled strips of dough.

Traditionally, the dough for hamantashen was made with yeast. With the invention of baking powder during the 1840s and its wide adoption during the first half of the twentieth century, baking powder supplanted yeast, and hamantashen dough became a cookie rather than pastry dough. To shape a hamantash, a filling is placed in the center of a circle of dough, which is then either folded in half and shaped into a triangle or the sides are brought to the center to form a triangle. The oldest and most traditional filling is mohn (poppy seed paste), with powidl or lekvar (prune jam) a close second. The cookie dough variety has spawned many different fillings, traditionally sweet (although savory varieties have become popular as well). Most popular are various jams, especially apricot and raspberry, but also date, raisins, apple, vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips, cherry, fig, chocolate, dulce de leche, halva, caramel, or cheese. The dough varies from hard like shortbread to a soft yeast dough.

==Etymology and symbolism==
In Yiddish, the word &quot;homentash&quot; is singular, while &quot;homentashn&quot; is the plural form. However, &quot;hamantashen&quot; is the more common word form among English speakers, even when referring to a single pastry (for example, &quot;I ate a poppy seed hamantashen&quot;).

&quot;Hamantash&quot; is also spelled &quot;hamentasch&quot;, &quot;homentash&quot;, &quot;homentasch&quot;, &quot;homentaschan&quot;, or even &quot;(h)umentash&quot;. The name &quot;hamantash&quot; is commonly viewed as a reference to Haman, the villain of Purim, as described in the Book of Esther. The pastries are supposed to symbolize the defeated enemy of the Jewish people. The word &quot;tash&quot; means &quot;pouch&quot; or &quot;pocket&quot; in Yiddish, and thus may refer to &quot;Haman&#x27;s pockets&quot;, symbolizing the money that Haman offered to Ahasuerus in exchange for permission to destroy the Jews. In Hebrew, &quot;tash&quot; means &quot;weaken&quot;, and the hamantash may celebrate the weakening of Haman and the hope that God will weaken all of the enemies of the Jews.

Another possible source of the name is a folk etymology: the Yiddish word מאָן־טאַשן (&quot;montashn&quot;) for a traditional delicacy, literally meaning &quot;poppyseed pouch&quot;, was transformed to &quot;hamantashen&quot;, likely by association with Haman or inclusion of the Hebrew article (). In Israel, hamantashen are called &quot;oznei Haman&quot; (), Hebrew for &quot;Haman&#x27;s ears&quot; in reference to their defeated enemy&#x27;s ears, although &quot;Haman&#x27;s ears&quot; also refers to a Sephardic Purim pastry that is twisted or rolled and fried. 

The reason for the three-sided shape is uncertain. There is a 20th-century legend that Haman wore a three-cornered hat. Alternatively, the Midrash says that when Haman recognized the merit of the Three Patriarchs, his strength immediately weakened. 

A simpler explanation is that the shape derives from traditional Jewish baking techniques in Central Europe for folding dough so as to form a pouch around a filling, also common for making dumplings. It has also been suggested that the shape is representative of female reproductive organs, and that the poppy-seed filling is a fertility symbol.

==Sweet fillings==
Sweet hamantashen fillings range from traditional options such as mohn (poppy seed), powidl or lekvar (prune), apricot jam, and date (especially popular in Israel) to raisin, apple, cherry, fig, chocolate, dulce de leche, halva, caramel, and cheese.

===Prune===
The prune hamantash was invented in 1731 by David Brandeis of Jung-Bunzlau, Bohemia. The daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis powidl (plum jam) which she claimed had made her family ill, as her father coincidentally died a few days after eating it. The burgomaster of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis&#x27;s store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of consumption and the charges were dismissed.

Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called &quot;Shir HaMa&#x27;alot l&#x27;David&quot; (&quot;A Song of Ascents to David&quot;), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. He was freed from prison four days before Purim after the charges against him were proven to be false, and in celebration of his release, Jews from his city celebrated with povidl or plum hamantashen.

==Savory fillings==
Savory hamantashen fillings have emerged in recent years, and their popularity has grown and are commonly prepared at home but can also be found in various Jewish bakeries and restaurants serving Jewish cuisine. Savory varieties may have fillings such as pizza ingredients, spinach and feta, lamb, potato, or cheese, and are often somewhat similar to other Jewish pastries such as the knish, bourekas, and sambusak.

==Preparation==



Sweet hamantashen are typically made with a dough containing butter or less commonly a pareve dough containing oil. Depending on the ingredients used in the dough, the consistency of the finished baking powder hamantash can range from dry and crumbly like shortbread, to soft and cakey like a black and white cookie, to firm and crisp like a butter cookie. The dough is generally prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, butter (or margarine or cooking oil), and a flavoring such as vanilla (or sometimes cocoa, grated lemon rind, rose water, or orange blossom water); sometimes milk is used in the dough; and usually a leavener such as baking powder or baking soda is added as well. The dough is then mixed gently so as to incorporate all the ingredients together without making the dough tough.

The dough is allowed to rest in the refrigerator and then is removed and rolled out to a thickness of between . Rounds of dough are stamped out and often brushed with an egg wash to encourage sealing prior to the addition of the filling (or the finished hamentash is brushed with egg wash before baking to produce a shiny golden surface). The most popular filling is poppyseed, but apricot, prune, strawberry, raspberry, chocolate, peanut butter and jelly, and others are also common. The bottom and the top two corners of the dough are folded inward but do not fully enclose the filling, allowing it to remain visible. Sometimes hamantashen may be frozen for a short period of time after shaping in order to prevent leakage of the filling. Then they are baked in an oven at medium heat for a short time. Sometimes after baking hamantashen may be dusted with powdered sugar, dipped in melted chocolate, or topped with sprinkles.

Savory hamantashen are prepared in much the same way as sweet hamantashen, though they are generally made with a different dough, such one similar to a pie crust, puff pastry, or modified sweet hamantashen dough containing less sugar.

==Hamantashen in Israel==

Hamantashen are known as &quot;oznei Haman&quot; in Israel, a term that also refers to the Sephardic pastry &quot;Orejas de Haman&quot;, twisted or rolled strips of dough that are fried, and are the most popular cookie sold at bakeries across Israel in the weeks leading up to Purim each year, with both large chains and small independent bakeries offering many different varieties. As in the diaspora, poppyseed remains the most-popular filling, with chocolate in second, and date filling coming in third in popularity. Jam is not nearly as common a filling as in America.

<doc id="1336529" wikidata="Q559878" url="?curid=1336529" title="Titus Calpurnius Siculus">
<text>Titus Calpurnius Siculus was a Roman bucolic poet. Eleven eclogues have been handed down to us under his name, of which the last four, from metrical considerations and express manuscript testimony, are now generally attributed to Nemesianus, who lived in the time of the emperor Carus and his sons (latter half of the 3rd century). The separate authorship of the eclogues of Calpurnius and Nemesianus was established by Haupt.

== Controversy over date ==

There is no doubt that Calpurnius&#x27;s eclogues post-date Virgil&#x27;s eclogues, as Calpurnius is heavily indebted, and frequently alludes to Virgil. However, the period in which Calpurnius was active has been debated and there is no overriding consensus.
Edward Gibbon placed him in the reign of Carus (282283 AD). In the late nineteenth century, Haupt asserted that Calpurnius wrote during the reign of Nero (5468 AD).

Evidence put forward for this Neronian dating includes the fact that, in Calpurnius&#x27;s eclogues I, IV, and VII, the emperor is described as a handsome youth, like Mars and Apollo, whose accession marks the beginning of a new golden age, prognosticated by the appearance of a comet, which is argued to be the same that appeared some time before the death of Claudius; he exhibits splendid games in the amphitheatre (probably the wooden amphitheatre erected by Nero in 57); and in the words (i.45) there is a reference to the speech delivered in Greek by Nero on behalf of the Ilienses (Suetonius, &quot;Nero&quot;, 7; Tacitus, &quot;Annals&quot;, xii.58), from whom the Julii derived their family.

In 1978 it was argued that Calpurnius was active in the reign of Severus (193211 AD). Arguments for such later dating of Calpurnius&#x27;s work are based on internal stylistic, metrical and lexical grounds – including what are considered by some to be allusions in Calpurnius&#x27;s poetry to Flavian-era literature. There has been subsequent disagreement among scholars as to the date of Calpurnius&#x27;s poetry, with some arguing for a Neronian Date, others for a later date.

==Life==

Nothing is known of the life of Calpurnius with any certainty. Some scholars have argued that Calpurnius is represented, in his poetry, by the character of Corydon and have attempted to draw conclusions about Calpurnius&#x27;s life from the life of Corydon portrayed in the eclogues.

From this it is deduced that Calpurnius was in poor circumstances and was on the point of emigrating to Spain, when a patron (represented in the poems by a certain Meliboeus) came to his aid. Through his influence Calpurnius apparently secured a post at Rome. The poet&#x27;s patron, has been variously identified with Columella, Seneca the philosopher, and Gaius Calpurnius Piso. Although the sphere of Meliboeus&#x27;s literary activity (as indicated in Eclogue iv.53) suits none of these, what is known of Calpurnius Piso fits in well with what is said of Meliboeus by the poet, who speaks of his generosity, his intimacy with the emperor, and his interest in tragic poetry. His claim is further supported by the poem &quot;De Laude Pisonis&quot; (ed. C.F. Weber, 1859) which has come down to us without the name of the author, but which there is considerable reason for attributing to Calpurnius, the other main contender being Lucan.

==Eclogues==
The eclogues are a collection of Latin poetry attributed to Calpurnius Siculus. Of his models the chief is Virgil, of whom (under the name of Tityrus) he speaks with great enthusiasm; he is also indebted to Ovid and Theocritus.

== Laus Pisonis and Einsiedeln Eclogues ==
The Laus Pisonis exhibits a striking similarity with Calpurnius&#x27;s eclogues in metre, language, and subject-matter. The author of the &quot;Laus&quot; is young, of respectable family and desirous of gaining the favour of Piso as his Maecenas. Further, the similarity between the two names can hardly be accidental; it is suggested that the poet may have been adopted by the courtier, or that he was the son of a freedman of Piso. The attitude of the author of the &quot;Laus&quot; towards the subject of the &quot;panegyricus&quot; seems to show less intimacy than the relations between Corydon and Meliboeus in the eclogues, and there is internal evidence that the &quot;Laus&quot; was written during the reign of Claudius (Teuffel-Schwabe, &quot;Hist. of Rom. Lit.&quot; 306,6).

Mention may here be made of the fragments of two short hexameter poems known as the Einsiedeln Eclogues, which share similarities with the poetry of Calpurnius.

<text>Warlock is a 1959 American Western film produced and directed by Edward Dmytryk starring Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, Anthony Quinn and Dorothy Malone. The picture is an adaptation of the novel &quot;Warlock&quot; by American author Oakley Hall. The film is both set and filmed in Utah.

Fonda portrays Clay Blaisedell, a freelance marshal in the fictional town of Warlock with implacable methods of dealing with troublemakers, while Widmark portrays Johnny Gannon, a former outlaw who eventually becomes the town&#x27;s deputy sheriff. A subplot centers on Blaisedell&#x27;s club-footed assistant, Tom Morgan, played by Quinn, who has sublimated his relationships and ambition into a warped devotion to Blaisedell, the only person Morgan thinks does not look down on him for his disability.

As in the earlier film &quot;Wichita&quot; (1955), the conflict of the law with the outlaw runs parallel to the resentment of the town&#x27;s own leadership.

==Plot==
Warlock is a small Utah mining town of the early 1880s. Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town, killing on a whim, and beating, humiliating and running out of town any deputy sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens&#x27; Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway. The town is not incorporated and does not have authority to have its own marshal.

Blaisedell arrives with his devoted clubfooted friend, Tom Morgan, an expert gunman as well. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that he is part of the package. Morgan becomes the manager of the town&#x27;s saloon.

Their first encounter with McQuown&#x27;s men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell, and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind, because he has become sick of their murderous ways.

Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell. Lily had left Morgan for Big Ben and knows that Morgan pushed Ben into challenging Blaisedell, who killed him. She wants Blaisedell dead to punish Morgan.

Morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach, but sees from a distance it being robbed by some of McQuown&#x27;s men. He takes advantage of the situation to kill Bob Nicholson unseen. Lily arrives in town and sees Morgan there. She correctly guesses that he pulled the trigger.

The robbers are arrested without incident by Blaisedell and a posse. Before taking them to Bright City for trial, the sheriff, who disapproves of Blaisedell, accepts Gannon&#x27;s offer to become Warlock&#x27;s new resident deputy.

The robbers, one of whom is Gannon&#x27;s younger brother Billy, are cleared by a jury intimidated by McQuown. The cowboys, led by Billy, immediately confront Blaisedell and Morgan in the street. Deputy Gannon asks them to leave and tells Billy, &quot;I ain&#x27;t backin&#x27; him, because you&#x27;re my brother, and I ain&#x27;t backin&#x27; you, because you&#x27;re wrong.&quot; A cowboy tries to shoot Blaisedell in the back, but is spotted by Morgan and shot. Blaisedell kills two others, including Billy, after giving him a chance to back down. McQuown&#x27;s smooth-talking man Curley posts wanted notices for Blaisedell, declaring the cowboys &quot;regulators&quot; in mockery of his quasi-legal status. Gannon vows to stop any regulators who come into town, and McQuown angrily stabs him in his gun hand.

Townspeople begin resenting Blaisedell and Morgan, exactly as Blaisedell had predicted. However, he has started a relationship with Jessie Marlow and decides to marry and settle down, much to the surprise of Morgan, who wants to move on.

Despite his injured hand, Gannon faces the cowboys alone after Morgan pulls a gun on Blaisedell, who had volunteered to back the deputy. With help from the citizens and from Curley, who promised him &quot;a fair fight&quot;, Gannon unexpectedly kills McQuown and breaks up the regulators for good. Morgan cannot tolerate the idea that Gannon is now more of a hero than Blaisedell, and he resents Lily&#x27;s attraction to the deputy, too. In the course of an argument, Blaisedell learns the truth about the deaths of the Nicholson brothers and turns his back on Morgan.

That evening, in a drunken state, Morgan calls Gannon out, intending to kill him. Blaisedell locks Deputy Gannon in his own cell, insisting, &quot;Tom Morgan&#x27;s my responsibility.&quot; Initially content to seem cowed, Morgan is pleased Blaisedell is a hero again, but when townspeople jeer and mock Morgan as he walks away, he challenges Blaisedell to a showdown. Morgan shoots off Blaisedell&#x27;s hat before being fatally wounded a split-second later. Morgan&#x27;s dying words are, &quot;I won, Clay, I won!&quot;

A grief-stricken Blaisedell carries his friend&#x27;s body into the saloon, which he burns down. Gannon tells Blaisedell that he will arrest him in the morning if he does not leave town. Blaisedell decides to leave. Jessie refuses to accompany him. The next day, Gannon and Blaisedell face one another. Blaisedell outdraws Gannon, but then throws his famous golden-handled revolvers into the sand, smiles at Gannon and rides off.

==Cast==
==Production==
Released by Twentieth Century Fox and shot in DeLuxe Color and CinemaScope, the film was adapted from Hall&#x27;s novel for the screen by Robert Alan Aurthur. Parts of the film were shot at Utah locations, including Dead Horse Point State Park, Arches National Park, Kings Bottom, Professor Valley, Sand Flats, and White&#x27;s Ranch in Moab (which was also a set for a number of other Westerns from the same era).

==Reception==

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote:Hand it to Mr. Aurthur and to Mr. Dmytryk, who also produced. They have put the whole picture together in a straight, precise layout of plots and accumulating action that hold interest up to the big scenes. Then when the shooting commences and climax follows climax—bang, bang, bang!—and strong men fight with their emotions, it is good, solid, gripping Western fare.Mr. Fonda, as usual, is excellent—melancholy, laconic and assured—and Mr. Widmark is properly nervous but full of sincerity and spunk. Mr. Quinn lays it on a little heavy in a slightly pathetic role, but he adds his measure of drama to the final rock-bottom goings-on. As a couple of complicating females, Dolores Michaels and Dorothy Malone provide the beauty and vexation that are essential to deep Western films. And a whole mob of performers do capital jobs in lesser roles—Tom Drake, Wallace Ford, Richard Arlen, DeForest Kelley and many more. &quot;Warlock&quot; is colorful and noisy. It should drag those Western fans out of their homes.

Later critics have referenced the homoerotic nature of the relationship between Quinn and Fonda; the film&#x27;s entry in The Aurum Film Encyclopedia describing it as &quot;perhaps the most open depiction of homosexual love in the classic Western&quot;.

<doc id="1336536" wikidata="Q583627" url="?curid=1336536" title="Sea mink">
<text>The sea mink (Neogale macrodon) is a recently extinct species of mink that lived on the eastern coast of North America around the Gulf of Maine on the New England seaboard. It was most closely related to the American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), with continuing debate about whether or not the sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (as &quot;Neogale vison macrodon&quot;) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are bone fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.

The sea mink was first described in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior similar to the American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to the nearby islands. The largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The sea mink was first described as &quot;Lutreola macrodon&quot;, distinct from the American mink, by , a medical doctor and ornithologist, in 1903, after it became extinct. Prentiss based his description on skull fragments recovered from Native American shell middens in New England. Most sea mink remains, nearly all of them skull fragments, have come from shell middens, but a complete specimen has never been found.

Debate has occurred regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or another subspecies of the American mink. Those who argue that the sea mink was a subspecies often refer to it as &quot;Neovison vison macrodon&quot;. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter&#x27;s classification as a separate species, and he named it &quot;Lutreola vison antiquus&quot;. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger ones being males and the smaller ones being females. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered two separate species.

The taxonomy of the minks was revised in 2000, resulting in the formation of a new genus, &quot;Neovison&quot;, which includes only the sea mink and the American mink. Formerly, both minks were classified in the genus &quot;Mustela&quot;. The species name &quot;macrodon&quot; translates to &quot;large teeth&quot;. According to Richard Manville, a naturalist who maintains that the sea mink is not a separate species, its closest relative is the common mink (&quot;N. v. mink&quot;), which also inhabits the New England area. A 2021 study into New World weasels found that the sea mink, along with four other extant species, should be classified into a new genus, &quot;Neogale&quot;.

Fur traders who hunted it gave the sea mink various names, including water marten, red otter, and fisher cat. Possibly the first description of this species was made by Sir Humphrey Gilbert
in the late 1500s as &quot;a fish like a greyhound&quot;, which was a reference to its affinity for the sea and its body shape and gait, which were apparently similar to that of a greyhound. It is possible that the fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;) got its name from being mistakenly identified as the sea mink, which was also known as the fisher by fur traders. The Abenaki Indians referred to it as the &quot;mousebeysoo&quot;, which means &quot;wet thing&quot;. It was named &quot;sea mink&quot; because it was always found near the coast by fur traders, and subsequently the American mink was often referred to as the &quot;woods mink&quot;.

==Range==
The sea mink was a marine mammal that lived around the rocky coasts of New England and the southernmost Maritime Provinces until it was hunted to extinction in the late 19th or early 20th century. Most sea mink remains are unearthed on the coast of Maine. Though it is speculated that they at one point inhabited Connecticut and Rhode Island, they were commonly trapped along the coast of the Bay of Fundy (in the Gulf of Maine), and it is said that they formerly existed on the southwestern coast of Nova Scotia. There were reports of unusually large mink furs being collected from Nova Scotia regularly. The bones of a specimen unearthed in Middleboro, Massachusetts, were dated to be around 4,300±300 years old, from salt water. The sea mink may have reached that area by traveling up rivers, or may have been brought there by Native Americans. The latter is most likely, as no other mink remains have been discovered between Casco Bay in Maine and southeastern Massachusetts. Sea mink bones have been unearthed in Canada, although these may have been carried there by Native Americans from the Gulf of Maine. The rugged shorelines of the Down East region of Maine may have represented a northernmost barrier in their range. Mead concluded that only American minks inhabited the mainland and that sea minks were restricted to islands off the coast. If this is the case, then all remains found on the mainland were carried there. Graham challenged that hypothesis, stating that it is unlikely that all sea mink specimens originate from one population.

During the last glacial period, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink&#x27;s range may have extended south of the Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this could be due to the rising sea levels—older sea mink remains may be submerged underwater. Alternately, the sea mink may have evolved after the last glacial period and filled a new ecological niche.

==Description==

Since the sea mink has only been described by fragmentary remains, its appearance and behaviors are not well-documented. Its relatives, as well as descriptions by fur traders and Native Americans, give a general idea of this animal&#x27;s appearance and its ecological roles. Accounts from Native Americans in the New England/Atlantic Canadian regions reported that the sea mink had a fatter body than the American mink. The sea mink produced a distinctive fishy odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than that of the American mink. It is thought that naturalist Joseph Banks encountered this animal in 1776 in the Strait of Belle Isle, and he described it as being slightly larger than a fox, having long legs, and a tail that was long and tapered toward the end, similar to a greyhound.

The sea mink was the largest of the minks. As only fragmentary skeletal remains of the sea mink exist, most of its external measurements are speculative and rely only on dental measurements. In 1929, Ernest Thompson Seton, a wildlife artist, concluded that the probable dimensions for this animal are from head to tail, with the tail being long. A possible mounted sea mink specimen collected in 1894 in Connecticut measured from head to tail and the tail was in length; a 1966 study found this to be either a large American mink or possibly a hybrid. The specimen was described as having coarse fur that was reddish-tan in color, though much of it was likely faded from age. It was darkest at the tail and the hind limbs, with a white patch between the forearms. There were also white spots on the left forearm and the groin region.

The type specimen was collected by Prentiss and Frederick True, a biologist, in 1897 in Brooklin, Maine, the remains of which consist of a maxilla, parts of the nasal bone, and the palate. The teeth are all present on the right side of the palate, and the left side consists of the incisors and one premolar. Other than a chipped canine, all the teeth are in good condition. The specimen is apparently larger than the Alaskan mink (&quot;N. v. nesolestes&quot;), as the average distance between the last incisor to the first molar is in the Alaskan mink, whereas that distance is in the type specimen. The nasal bone has an abrupter ascension, and the carnassial teeth make a more acute angle with the gums than those of the common mink (&quot;N. v. mink&quot;).

These minks were large and heavily built, with a low sagittal crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, in that it was clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital foramina (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (&quot;N. v. nesolestes&quot;), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink&#x27;s wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.

==Behavior==

Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon. As marine mammal species often play a large part in their ecosystems, the sea mink could have been an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, consuming seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Its seafood-oriented diet may have increased its size. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet.

According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. It reportedly made a den with two entrances in the rocks piled up by the waves. Like other minks, individual sea minks may have maintained home ranges, and since the males were larger and required more food, males would have had larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, and they may have had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, it is possible that they hybridized with each other.

==Exploitation and extinction==

The sea mink was pursued by fur traders due to its large size; this made it more desirable than other mink species further inland. The unregulated fur trade eventually led to its extinction, which is thought to have occurred between 1860 and 1920. The sea mink was seldom sighted after 1860. The last two recorded kills of a sea mink were made in Maine in 1880 near Jonesport, Maine, and Campobello Island, New Brunswick, in 1894, although the 1894 kill is speculated to be of large American minks. Fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs, although they were rarely trapped. If a sea mink escaped into a small hole on the rocky ledges, it was dug out by hunters using shovels and crowbars. If it was out of reach of the hunters, it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a screw on the far end. If it was hiding, it was smoked out and suffocated. The minks&#x27; nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight.

Since the remains of brain cases found in shell middens are broken and many of the bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and possibly for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.

<text>Enric Valor i Vives (; 1911 in Castalla, Alicante, Spain – 2000 in Valencia, Spain) was a Spanish narrator and grammarian who made one of the most important contributions to the re-collection and recovery of Valencian lexicography and its standardization in the Valencian Community, Spain.

==Biography==
Enric Valor was born in 1911, the son of an affluent family from Castalla, in the Valencian comarca of &quot;l&#x27;Alcoià&quot;. In 1930, at the age of nineteen, he became a journalist in Alicante writing in the satirical newspaper &quot;El Tio Cuc&quot;, in Valencian. During the Second Spanish Republic he started to become politically active. His main demand was for autonomous status for the Valencian Community. He was also at this time working in the city of Valencia in the nationalist newspapers &quot;La República de les Lletres&quot;, &quot;El Camí&quot; and &quot;El País Valencià&quot;. When the Spanish Civil War broke out he supported the Spanish Republic.

After the war, he cut back on his political activities to concentrate on literature. At the beginning of the 1950s he started to compile &quot;rondalles&quot;, a type of folk narrative, which were published as &quot;Rondalles valencianes&quot; (1950–1958). During the 1960s he returned to underground political activities involving Valencian nationalism and, as a result, he became a political prisoner of Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spanish State from 1966 to 1968. Once out of prison he founded almost the first magazine in Valencian in the postwar period; &quot;Gorg&quot; (&quot;Whirl&quot;, in Valencian). When the Francoist State ended, Enric Valor was able to spread freely his opinions and literary works. He became honoured with many important literary and linguistic awards from all over the &quot;Països Catalans&quot;. During the 1990s there was a move among some Valencian cultural groups to propose Valor as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but it didn&#x27;t come to fruit.

Valor then died in 2000.

==Linguistic works==

His first linguistic work was in the weekly magazine &quot;El Tio Cuc&quot; based in Alicante. He was contributing to the development of the Catalan-Valencian-Balearic Dictionary (such a Catalan inter-dialectal dictionary) under the directorship of Francesc de Borja i Moll, which included a Southern Valencian lexicon. Like Carles Salvador and Sanchis Guarner, he was one of the principal promoters of the standardisation of Valencian by means of works such as &quot;Curs de la llengua valenciana&quot; (&quot;Gorg&quot;, 1961), &quot;Millorem el llenguatge&quot; (1971), and &quot;Curso medio de gramática catalana referida especialmente al País Valenciano&quot; (1973).

In 1983 he released &quot;La flexió verbal&quot; where he summarized the widely dialectised Valencian verbs. This work became the principal reference for the normative use of verbs, and is used as essential teaching material for Valencian pupils.

==Literary works==

His most known work is &quot;Rondalles valencianes&quot; (1950–1958), where 36 valencian popular tales are collected as a literary narration. Other works with a similar style are &quot;Narracions de la Foia de Castalla&quot; (1953), and &quot;Meravelles i picardies&quot; (1964–1970).

Valor was also a writer. His first novel was &quot;L&#x27;ambició d&#x27;Aleix&quot; which was started between the 1940s and 1950s, but it was being re-written until its release in 1960. Perhaps his most important novel work is &quot;Cicle de Cassana&quot; which is made up of three novels: &quot;Sense la terra promesa&quot; (1960), &quot;Temps de batuda&quot; (1983), and &quot;Enllà de l&#x27;horitzó&quot; (1991). The &quot;Cicle de Cassana&quot; trilogy aims for the regaining of collective memory between 1916 and 1939. In 1982 he published &quot;La idea de l&#x27;emigrant&quot;.
