<text>&quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the eighth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 16, 1997. In the episode, Homer dissociates himself from new family friend John after discovering that John is gay. Homer particularly fears that his son Bart will become gay if Bart spends time with John, so Homer decides to do hypermasculine activities with Bart, believing the activities will ensure Bart turns out to be heterosexual.

It was the first episode written by Ron Hauge and was directed by Mike B. Anderson. George Meyer pitched &quot;Bart the homo&quot; as an initial idea for an episode while showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were planning an episode involving Lisa &quot;discovering the joys of campy things&quot;. Oakley and Weinstein combined the two ideas, and they eventually became &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot;. Fox censors originally found the episode unsuitable for broadcast because of its controversial subject matter, but this decision was reversed after a turnover in the Fox staff. Filmmaker John Waters guest-starred, providing the voice of the new character, John (named &quot;Javier&quot; in the Latin American Spanish version).

&quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; was the show&#x27;s first episode to revolve entirely around gay themes and received a positive critical response both for its humor and anti-homophobia message. It won four awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less) and a GLAAD Media Award for &quot;Outstanding TV – Individual Episode&quot; in 1998.

==Plot==
The Simpsons need money to pay for a $900 repair after Bart damages the gas line. Marge tries to sell a family heirloom — an &quot;authentic&quot; American Civil War doll — to Cockamamie&#x27;s, a collectibles shop. Marge is disappointed when John, the shop owner, reveals her precious heirloom is a cheap liquor bottle of little value. Despite this, the Simpsons take an instant liking to John, and invite him to their house, where he is fascinated by the many campy items the family owns.

The next morning, Homer tells Marge that he likes John and suggests inviting John and &quot;his wife&quot; over. When Marge informs Homer that John is gay, Homer is horrified. Homer&#x27;s attitude towards John changes completely, and he refuses to join the tour of Springfield that John has arranged. The rest of the family joins John for the tour and enjoy his company. Bart starts wearing Hawaiian shirts, dancing in women&#x27;s wigs and eating cupcakes with strawberry icing instead of chocolate icing, which makes Homer worry that Bart might be gay.

Hoping to turn Bart heterosexual, Homer forces him to stare at a cigarette billboard featuring scantily clad women. This backfires when Bart craves slim cigarettes, considered effeminate because they are marketed to women. Convinced Bart needs manly role models, Homer takes Bart to a steel mill. However, all of the mill&#x27;s employees are effeminate gay men, and the mill doubles as a gay bar called &quot;The Anvil&quot;.

Desperate, Homer decides to take Bart deer hunting with Moe and Barney. When they cannot find any deer, they decide to shoot reindeer at Santa&#x27;s Village instead. The reindeer violently attack the hunters, who are genuinely afraid and drop their macho posturing. With help from Lisa and Marge, John uses a Japanese Santa Claus robot to scare away the reindeer and save the hunting party. Homer is grateful to John for saving their lives and grudgingly accepts John&#x27;s sexuality. As John drives everyone home, Homer tells Bart he is fine with however he chooses to live his life. Bart is confused until Lisa explains Homer&#x27;s belief that Bart is gay. Bart is shocked by this; the family&#x27;s car drives away, blaring a gay anthem.

==Production==

The original concept for the episode came from a few lines of show ideas written by George Meyer. One of them read &quot;Bart the homo&quot;, and Ron Hauge was selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line. The idea of using filmmaker John Waters as a guest star had been around for a while. Many of the staff were fans of his work, and showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had planned to use him in an episode called &quot;Lisa and Camp&quot;, which revolved around Lisa &quot;discovering the joys of campy things&quot;. Their idea was combined with Meyer&#x27;s, and it became this episode. The episode was originally titled &quot;Bart Goes to Camp&quot;, but was renamed because the joke was too oblique. Mike B. Anderson directed the episode, telling &quot;The Gold Coast Bulletin&quot;: &quot;When I read the script I was enthralled, not only because of the visual possibilities, but also because the story felt very solid. It was engaging and surprising and I really put heart into that episode.&quot;

Waters accepted his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating that if it was good enough for the actress Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared in the season four episodes &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot; and &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, it was good enough for him. He joked, however, about a negative reaction if his character would be made to look like fitness personality Richard Simmons. John&#x27;s design was based largely on Waters&#x27; own appearance; for animation reasons, Waters&#x27; moustache was changed from straight to curvy, so that it did not look like a mistake.

According to Oakley, the Fox censor objected to &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; being aired. The normal procedure is for an episode&#x27;s script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted. However, this episode came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line in the show. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word &quot;gay&quot;, or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph that stated that &quot;the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast&quot;. Usually the censor notes are ignored as the offending lines and problems are dealt with after the episode has been animated. In this case, the entire episode was deemed a problem, so it could not be solved in this way. The censor problems ultimately came to nothing as when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: &quot;acceptable for broadcast&quot;.

The steel mill scene was written by Steve Tompkins. He first pitched that Homer and Bart would encounter longshoremen, but it was too much work to animate the lading of ships, so a steel mill was used instead. Tompkins also wrote a different third act for the episode, which was never produced. Instead of Homer, Bart, Barney, and Moe going deer hunting and ending up at &quot;Santa&#x27;s Village&quot; they would go back to the steel mill. There, Homer would attempt to prove his heterosexuality by having a human tractor pulling contest with some of the steel mill workers. It was dropped as the writers found it didn&#x27;t add anything to the storyline.

==Cultural references==
The episode features numerous cultural references. The song &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot; by C+C Music Factory is played twice during the episode: first as the steel mill transforms into a disco, and second over the alternate closing credits. Homer&#x27;s record collection includes music by The New Christy Minstrels and The Wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson, the albums &quot;Loony Luau&quot; and &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler. The song that John picks out and he and Homer dance to is &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; by Alicia Bridges, and the song that Bart dances to is &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song (It&#x27;s in His Kiss)&quot; where he parodies young Christina Ricci from the music video of Cher&#x27;s version. The original was recorded by Betty Everett. When John is introduced, there is a plastic pink flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters&#x27; film &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;. Items in John&#x27;s store include several buttons endorsing political campaigns of Richard Nixon, Dan Quayle, and Bob Dole as well as an issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis that features the title characters from the sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; on the cover. John&#x27;s car, which bears a striking resemblance to the Cadillac driven by Tony Montana in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983)&quot;,&quot; honks the first bar of &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&quot; from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), referencing Judy Garland&#x27;s status as a gay icon. When John takes the Simpson family on a driving tour of Springfield&#x27;s shopping district, he points out a store where he claims that the Mexican film actress Lupe Vélez bought the toilet she drowned in. This is a reference to the urban legend that Velez was found dead with her head in the toilet the night of her suicide in 1944. The couch gag in this episode parodies the AOL Dial-up Internet access sign-on process, parodying it &quot;America On-Link&quot;. On a System 7 Mac-like interface, the user attempts to sign in, getting to a stalled progress bar titled &quot;loading family&quot;. The unseen user, presumably frustrated with the delay, clicks the &quot;Cancel&quot; button repeatedly, triggering the &quot;Sosumi&quot; alert to be played each time in response. At the time, AOL users suffered significant issues accessing the service after AOL moved from hourly billing to a flat monthly fee, saturating capacity.

==Reception==

In its original broadcast, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; finished tied for 47th place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 10–16, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.7. It was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.

The episode won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less) in 1997. Mike Anderson won the Annie Award for Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a TV Production, and the WAC Award for Best Director for Primetime Series at the 1998 World Animation Celebration. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation called it &quot;a shining example of how to bring intelligent, fair and funny representations of our community onto television&quot; and awarded it the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV – Individual Episode. Several of the episode&#x27;s animation cells were selected for display at the Silver K Gallery in Melbourne, Australia in 2001.

&quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; has been cited as a significant part of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ exploration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes. The series made several references to homosexuality before the episode aired. In the 1990 episode &quot;Simpson and Delilah,&quot; the character Karl (voiced by Harvey Fierstein) kisses Homer, while the recurring character Waylon Smithers is often shown to be in love with his boss, Montgomery Burns, initially suggestively and since then more overtly. However, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; was the first episode to revolve entirely around homosexual themes. Two later episodes that explored LGBT issues were &quot;Three Gays of the Condo&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Marrying&quot;.

When the episode aired, the production team received &quot;very few&quot; complaints about its content, with most of the response being positive. Alan Frutkin gave the episode a positive write-up in the LGBT-interest magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;, calling it &quot;vintage &quot;Simpsons&quot;.&quot; Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood stated in their book, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, that: &quot;Only &quot;The Simpsons&quot; could do this so tongue-in-cheek that nobody could get in a tizzy about it. Very good indeed.&quot; In the book &quot;Leaving Springfield&quot;, Matthew Henry praised the episode&#x27;s critiquing of &quot;the most common misconception about homosexuality: namely that gayness is somehow contagious&quot;, as well as its other themes. Catharine Lumby of the University of Sydney cited the episode as an example of good satire as it &quot;managed to explore a lot of [homosexual] issues in quite a deep way [...] without being overtly political&quot;, which she claimed, along with the episode&#x27;s humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that of other gay-themed shows like &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. In his review of &quot;The Simpsons – The Complete Eighth Season&quot; DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that the episode &quot;certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed it in its list of top twelve &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes. It was placed fifth on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s top 25 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode list. In 2003, &quot;USA Today&quot; published a top 10 episodes list chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive, which had this episode listed in tenth place. IGN ranked John Waters&#x27; performance as the ninth-best guest appearance in the show&#x27;s history, with &quot;TV Guide&quot; naming him the third-best film-related guest star. In a 2008 article, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Waters as one of the 16 best &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest stars. John Patterson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Waters&#x27; appearance &quot;felt to me like a summit meeting between the most influential pop-culture figures of the last 25 years&quot;. When &quot;The Simpsons&quot; began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes to watch on the service.

Conversely, in 2002, &quot;Off the Telly&quot; writers Steve Williams and Ian Jones named &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; one of the five worst episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, stating that it &quot;leaves such a nasty taste in the mouth,&quot; as Homer is &quot;quite simply a bastard&quot; throughout the course of the episode. The pair concluded by saying &quot;this is a side of the show we&#x27;d not seen before, nor particularly wanted to see&quot;. In June 2003, Igor Smykov sued the Russian television channel REN TV on claims that &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, along with &quot;Family Guy&quot;, were &quot;morally degenerate and promoted drugs, violence and homosexuality&quot;. As evidence, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; was shown to the judge to prove that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; promoted homosexuality and thus should not be aired again on the channel. The case was thrown out after one day.

In July 2021, Cathal Gunning of Screen Rant argued that the episode made a huge contribution to &quot;normalizing LGBTQ+ characters,&quot; noting that they were a rarity at the time the episode aired, and it didn&#x27;t &quot;treat its first openly gay character as a walking joke.&quot; Gunning also argued that the episode was &quot;groundbreaking&quot; because Homer&#x27;s fear of a gay man, voiced by John Waters, was mocked, rather than Waters&#x27; character, and heralded the episode for being &quot;one of the first attempts to break down the invisible barrier faced by gay characters&quot; while noting it lampooned the hypermasculinity of Homer&#x27;s friends.

<doc id="1335282" wikidata="Q125643527" url="?curid=1335282" title="Strago Magus">
<text>Strago Magus, known in Japan as is a character introduced in the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Square Enix. Created by Akiyoshi Ohta, Strago is a Blue Mage, a recurring character class in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise that fights using magical abilities learned from enemy monsters. A descendant of warriors in a past tragedy, Strago tends for his granddaughter Relm Arrowny, and later joins the protagonists to ensure that same tragedy does not repeat. He has since appeared in other games related to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, including &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where he is voiced by Kenichi Ogata.

Strago received mixed reception, regarded as a filler character and cited as an example of the development team&#x27;s difficulty in juggling such a large cast. However his caring for Relm in a harsh world received praise, especially in light of cut content related to the character. He was additionally observed through the scope of his role as an elderly figure amongst the game&#x27;s cast and the narrative possibilities it represented, but also the view on Japanese culture and their own approach to family structure.

==Appearances==
Strago Magus is character in the 1994 Square Enix video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, classified as a Blue Mage, a recurring type of magical user in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise that can learn and use certain abilities from enemy monsters. An elderly gentleman living in the village of Thamasa, he is the adoptive grandfather of the character Relm Arrowny and a descendant of the warriors who fought in the War of the Magi, a battle that occurred long before the events of the game but relates heavily to its central plot. He initially hides his magical ability until the protagonists rescue Relm from a fire, and he accompanies them in their goal to discover the home of the espers, a race of magical beings. Upon discovery that the game&#x27;s antagonist, the Gestahlian Empire, is enslaving espers for their magic, he fears a repeat of the War of the Magi and both he and Relm join the party fully to stop the Empire&#x27;s ambitions.

Later in the game&#x27;s second half, after the world has been devastated and the party separated, Strago believes Relm to be dead and falls in with a group of cultists, becoming lethargic and unresponsive. However, after the party rescues Relm if they bring her to him, he snaps out of his stupor and rejoins the group. Later he discovers a longtime friend of his was seriously injured by a monster the two had hunted when they were young men. Traveling to the monster&#x27;s last known location at Ebot&#x27;s Rock, Strago faces and defeats it with the party&#x27;s help, and learns its unique attack &quot;Grand Delta&quot;.

In other games, he is additionally a playable character in &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot; and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where in the latter he is voiced by Kenichi Ogata. Outside of video games, cards representing Strago have been produced for the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;. A keychain figure based on his chibi artwork was also produced by Bandai, as part of a series to promote the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;.

==Conception and design==

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was developed with the mindset that none of the playable cast was the protagonist, and that each of them were equally the &quot;main character&quot;. The cast of characters were selected from submissions from across the development team, with game planner Akiyoshi Ohta choosing Relm and her related characters. Once the cast was selected, each individual would write their character&#x27;s story, with Yoshinori Kitase balancing the plot as things developed. Though not stated in game, Relm is not a blood relative of Strago, but the daughter of a friend he took in. Regardless, his personality is established as heavily doting on her, while acting as an &quot;elder&quot; figure to the rest of the group. In Japanese his name was originally Stragos, shortened in English localizations due to issues with name lengths in the original Western releases.

Standing 151 cm (5 ft) tall, an early draft of the character&#x27;s appearance was drawn by Nomura, while Yoshitaka Amano was commissioned to design the characters from the brief outlines provided. Given full creative freedom, Amano wanted to make &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation in-game as small computer sprites. Said graphics were designed by Nomura, who drew the chibi artwork of the characters, and Kazuko Shibuya, who designed the in-game sprites. Strago appears as a short, elderly man with a white beard and mohawk, a cape, a red tanktop, and patterned pants that are puffed towards the lower legs.

Several other elements of Strago&#x27;s character were also cut. A scene was originally intended between himself and the character Shadow, where Strago would confirm him in one of the game&#x27;s inn locations and ask to see his face to confirm his actual identity, after which they would drink together. Another concept that was also removed involved Strago rebuilding a village. Intended as a city-building mini-game &quot;similar to &quot;SimCity&quot;&quot;, it was conceived early in the planning stages of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; but cut due to issues with the development schedule. Lastly, Strago was also intended to have a wife who would have also been a playable character. Named Lara, she was defined as a Geomancer-type mage, and would have bickered with Strago about which of two of them would die first, though at the same were intended to be &quot;a good couple that protected each other&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Strago received mixed reception. Mike Minotti of &quot;VentureBeat&quot; cited him as an example of a &quot;filler character&quot; commonly found in roleplaying games that players often cared little about. On the other hand, Japanese musician Kenichi Maeyamada in an article for &quot;4Gamer.net&quot; cited Strago&#x27;s emotional downfall as one of the game&#x27;s darkest moments, illustrating personal trauma at the believed loss of his granddaughter and friends in a way that stuck with him. The staff of &quot;RPGFan&quot; meanwhile felt Strago&#x27;s return to the party was a bit shallow by comparison, and cited him as an example of how &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;″s large cast caused certain characters to regrettably have little fleshed-out content.

In contrast, Patrick Holleman in the book &quot;Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VI&quot; observed that despite being such a late-game addition to the party he had quite a large amount of dialogue, often providing exposition to events that happened prior to the game&#x27;s story and how they were relevant to it. However his introduction to the party by comparison was rather brief, and Holleman felt that was the reason behind the Ebot&#x27;s Rock quest, as few if any of the party members got a second quest. Additionally Holleman felt the quest tapped into another aspect of Strago&#x27;s character: his age. As an older character, it was easier for the development team to portray him with hidden depth and a more fleshed out backstory, something that in his point of view wasn&#x27;t as easy to do with characters in their teens.
===Analysis of themes and music===

In the book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Pierre Maugein described him as &quot;the third piece in the emotional family puzzle&quot; in the game that consists of himself, Relm and Shadow. Acting as a paternal figure to Relm, Maugein stated that while his role as a substitute father could be read as often kowtowing to her aggressive nature, he felt Strago was instead trying to offer support and understanding for her difficult past and her need for confrontation. When observing the cut character of his wife, Maugein felt the development team was consciously trying to avoid a support structure that would have lightened the game&#x27;s overall mood by not including her. Instead the emphasis on Strago as her sole guardian helped paint a picture of survival in a harsh world, and underlined their tragic family experiences.

Maugein also observed how Strago&#x27;s age is represented in the game, not only through how completion of his personal quest revitalizes him emotionally, but also how easily his despair led him into the Cult of Kefka when he thought Relm had died. He saw that particular moment as an old man that has given up, accepting his approaching death instead of trying to find the energy to keep going. Calling him &quot;sweet in his quirks and his role as a wise but clumsy forebear&quot;, Maugein felt that his liveliness hid a personal struggle, something he saw reflected in the removed cutscene with Shadow. Strago to him also represented a view on the elderly in Japanese culture with how grandparents are often at the center of the family in contrast to Western society, an &quot;oft-times tiresome, old man who still provokes deep respect&quot; that reflected Relm&#x27;s &quot;acerbity&quot; that represented a shift in the Japanese use away from such paradigms. He close with stating that more than any other character in the game, Strago represented &quot;living for a loved one is a profound act of resistance&quot;.

Other books also examined the character. Sebastian Deken in his book discussing &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;″s characters and how their music related to them noted that while Strago&#x27;s was more atmospheric, it still reflected his secretive nature. The book &quot;Final Fantasy and Philosophy&quot; meanwhile cited Strago&#x27;s eccentricities as an example of a prevailing theme in literature of positive portrayals of madness.

<doc id="1335284" wikidata="Q804795" url="?curid=1335284" title="Baldassare Donato">
<text>Baldassare Donato (also Donati) (1525-1530 – June 1603) was an Italian composer and singer of the Venetian school of the late Renaissance. He was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the prestigious St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica at the end of the 16th century, and was an important figure in the development of Italian light secular music, especially the villanella.

==Life==
Details of his early life are unavailable; it is not even known where he was born. The first record of Donato is as a singer at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice in 1550, and he was given charge of the musical training of the boys there in 1562. When Gioseffo Zarlino took over the post of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; from Cipriano de Rore in 1565, Donato was demoted back to being a singer; conflict between the two men seems to have been a feature of life at St. Mark&#x27;s, culminating in a climactic fight in 1569, publicly and scandalously, during the Feast of St. Mark. In 1577 Donato took a position at the Scuola Grande di S Rocco, another Venetian church with an impressive musical tradition and substantial performing ensemble; however he failed to get along with his employers there as well, resigning by 1580. In 1588 he became assistant &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s, while Zarlino was still alive (whether because of reconcilement or politics is not clear), and in 1590 he took over the post of his former antagonist, holding it until his death in 1603.

==Music and influence==
Donato represented a progressive trend in the Venetian school, which was already a progressive tradition compared to the other major contemporary Italian musical styles (especially as compared to the Roman School). The progressive trend in the Venetian school was represented by composers such as Donato, Giovanni Croce, and Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli; the conservative trend involved composers and theorists such as Zarlino, Cipriano de Rore, and Claudio Merulo, who tended to follow the Franco-Flemish style which was predominant almost everywhere else in Europe until after mid-century.

Donato&#x27;s sacred music is the most conservative portion of his output, usually using polyphony in the Palestrina style, but also using some of the grand polychoral effects of the Gabrielis. In spite of his evident disdain for Zarlino&#x27;s conservatism, he clearly absorbed some of his style and teaching, as can be seen in his smooth mastery of counterpoint and Zarlinoesque use of dissonance, at least when he was deliberately composing in the Franco-Flemish style.

Probably his greatest significance to music history is in the development of a light secular form known as the villanella, a lighter form of madrigal, of Neapolitan origin. Some of these pieces may have been intended for dancing, and they were evidently popular. They are similar to the French chanson, often have a memorable melody in the topmost part, contain vigorous cross-rhythms, and avoid the polyphonic and chromatic complexity of the mid-century madrigal.

Donato also wrote madrigals in a more serious style, as well as psalm settings, motets, and ceremonial music.

<doc id="1335285" wikidata="Q8004336" url="?curid=1335285" title="William Allen (Canadian politician)">
<text>William Randall Allen (June 29, 1919 – October 1, 1985) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the Chairman of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto from 1962 to 1969. He is the namesake of the William R. Allen Road in Toronto, Ontario.

==Background==
Born in Buckingham, Quebec (on the outskirts of Ottawa, Ontario), Allen was a graduate of St. Michael&#x27;s College School, the University of Toronto, and Osgoode Hall Law School. During World War II, he enlisted with the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers and attained the rank of captain, serving overseas in Britain and Europe. 

After being called to the Ontario Bar in 1949, Allen was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1960. He married Marjorie Hornberger; together, they raised three children.

His father, Robert Aloysius Allen, was an alderman and then a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament representing Riverdale during the 1930s. Robert Allen was the first Liberal to be elected to the legislature from Riverdale since Confederation in 1867. Robert Allen&#x27;s father-in-law, Randall McDonnell, was the mayor of Mayo, Quebec for 13 consecutive years.

==Politics==
In 1950, William Allen entered municipal politics with his election as an alderman on Toronto city council, representing Riverdale in Ward 1. He subsequently was elected by the City of Toronto to become the youngest Controller in Toronto history. He was a member of the first Metropolitan Toronto Council in 1952. In the 1955 Toronto municipal election, Allen was elected to the Toronto Board of Control and was re-elected in 1956, 1958, and 1960. In 1958 and 1960 he finished in the top two, of the four Controllers elected, enabling him to return to Metro Council. 

Metropolitan Toronto was created by the Province of Ontario in 1952 and comprised Toronto, North York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, York, and East York. While these municipalities continued to manage some local matters, Metropolitan Toronto assumed the responsibilities of more expensive programs, such as the TTC, police, and welfare. The municipality was presided over by a &quot;super mayor&quot;, or Metro Chairman, for its 46-year duration until amalgamation in 1998.

Undefeated in civic elections, Allen remained in municipal office until 1962 when, upon the retirement of Fred Gardiner (namesake of the Gardiner Expressway), Allen defeated the Reeve of North York, Norman C. Goodhead, to become the second Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto. At the time, many felt Allen&#x27;s Catholicism would serve as a roadblock in the election.

Allen continued to build the infrastructure that began with his predecessor, Metro&#x27;s first Chairman, Fred Gardiner. Most notably, the Bloor-Danforth and University subway lines opened during Allen&#x27;s tenure. Furthermore, Allen also initiated many social programs that included welfare assistance and old age homes. Allen cited the latter initiative as one of his proudest achievements. Metro&#x27;s fourth chair, Paul V. Godfrey, told reporters after Allen&#x27;s death 25 years later that he gave Metro its &quot;human touch&quot;. (Toronto Star, October 1/85)

Allen retired from the post in 1969. After leaving politics, he served as President and CEO to several corporations and sat on the Board of Directors for Molson, Air Canada, York University, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and others. Allen continued to practice law before being appointed President of the Canadian National Exhibition from 1979 to 1980.

During his political career, Allen served on all City Council and Metropolitan Council Standing Committees. He also held positions with a number of external bodies. He was President of the Ontario Municipal Association, Honorary President of the Convention and Tourist Bureau of Metropolitan Toronto, and Honorary Vice-President of Boy Scouts of Canada.

Allen maintained similar policies set out by his predecessor, Fred Gardiner. Toronto was going through a period of change, and he did little to impede that process. He presided over the expansion of the subway network and continued with the expressway building program, which was cancelled after his exit from politics.

==Retirement==
Upon his retirement, the Spadina Expressway was renamed the William R. Allen Expressway (now the William R. Allen Road) in honour of Allen&#x27;s distinguished civic service. The &quot;Allen&quot; runs from Kennard Avenue (Wilson Heights Boulevard link) in the north, to Eglinton Avenue West in the south.

Allen strongly opposed amalgamation until his death in 1985 (Globe and Mail, October 1/85). He is buried at Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery.

<doc id="1335297" wikidata="Q2778319" url="?curid=1335297" title="Spaceship Earth">
<text>Spaceship Earth (or Spacecraft Earth or Spaceship Planet Earth) is a worldview encouraging everyone on Earth to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.

==History==
The earliest known use of the term is a passage in Henry George&#x27;s best known work, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (1879). From book IV, chapter 2: 
It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, &quot;This is mine!&quot;

Around the same time, Walt Whitman in &quot;Old Age Echoes&quot; (&quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, multiple editions between 1855 and 1891) associated:

&quot;One thought ever at the fore—

That at the Divine Ship, the World, breasting Time and Space,

All peoples of the globe together sail, sail the same voyage, are bound to the same destination.&quot;

George Orwell had earlier paraphrased Henry George in his 1937 book &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;:
The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.

In 1965, Adlai Stevenson made a speech to the United Nations, in which he said:

We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.

The following year, &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson&#x27;s, the economist Barbara Ward.

In 1966, Kenneth E. Boulding, who was influenced by reading Henry George&#x27;s work, used the phrase in the title of his essay, &quot;The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth&quot;. Boulding described the past open economy of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the &quot;cowboy economy&quot;, and continued: &quot;The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the &#x27;spaceman&#x27; economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system&quot;. This &quot;cowboys in a spaceship&quot; theme would eventually be taken up by scholar David Korten in his 1995 book &quot;When Corporations Rule the World&quot;.

The phrase was also popularized by Buckminster Fuller, who authored the 1968 book &quot;Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth&quot;. This quotation, referring to fossil fuels, reflects his approach: 
... we can make all of humanity successful through science&#x27;s world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years&#x27; energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth. These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship&#x27;s life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.

United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of Spaceship Earth on Earth Day March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the Japanese Peace Bell: &quot;May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.&quot;

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the diameter geodesic sphere that greets visitors at the entrance of Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot theme park. Housed within the sphere is a dark ride that serves to explore the history of communications and promote Epcot&#x27;s founding principles, &quot;[a] belief and pride in man&#x27;s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere.&quot; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor Jeremy Irons and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers... We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.

The term &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; is frequently used on the labels of Emanuel Bronner&#x27;s products to emphasize and promote his belief in the unity of humankind.

==Criticism==

Sociologist Steffen Roth has argued that, if realized, Spaceship Earth would epitomise the most total institution ever created in human history.

<doc id="1335306" wikidata="Q3474969" url="?curid=1335306" title="Sacking of Lawrence">
<text>The sacking of Lawrence occurred on May 21, 1856, when pro-slavery settlers, led by Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, attacked and ransacked Lawrence, Kansas, a town that had been founded by anti-slavery settlers from Massachusetts who were hoping to make Kansas a free state. The incident fueled the irregular conflict in Kansas Territory that later became known as Bleeding Kansas.

The human cost of the attack was low: only one persona member of the pro-slavery gangwas killed, and his death was accidental. However, Jones and his men halted production of the Free-State newspapers the &quot;Kansas Free State&quot; and the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot;, destroying the presses and offices (with the former ceasing publication altogether and the latter taking months to once again start up). The pro-slavery men also destroyed the Free State Hotel and Charles L. Robinson&#x27;s house.

==Background==

Lawrence was founded in 1854 by antislavery settlers from Massachusetts, many of whom received financial support from the New England Emigrant Aid Company. The town was the &quot;de facto&quot; headquarters of Free-State Kansas, which led to its becoming the epicenter of violence in the territory. The many pro-slavery settlers in eastern Kansas loathed the Free-State residents of the town (and vice versa). While the village had nearly been raided during the so-called Wakarusa War in December 1855, it was not directly attacked at that time.

Abolitionists and Free-Staters at the time saw the sack as a reply to the non-fatal shooting on April 23, 1856, of Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, who was in Lawrence attempting to arrest Free-State settlers under the premise of events during the Wakarusa War. Lawrence residents drove Jones out of town after they shot him. On May 11, Federal Marshal Israel B. Donalson proclaimed that the &quot;assassination attempt&quot; had interfered with the execution of warrants against the extralegal Free-State legislature, which was set up in opposition to the official pro-slavery or &quot;bogus&quot; territorial government. 

Donalson&#x27;s proclamation and the by the first district of Kansas&#x27;s grand jury that &quot;the building known as the &#x27;Free State&#x27; Hotel&#x27; in Lawrence had been constructed with a view to military occupation and defense, regularly parapeted and portholed, for the use of cannon and small arms, thereby endangering the public safety, and encouraging rebellion and sedition in this country&quot; enabled Sheriff Jones and Marshal Donalson assembling an army of roughly 800 Southern settlers. This group planned to enter Lawrence, disarm the citizens, destroy the antislavery newspapers, and level the Free State Hotel.

==Sack==

On May 21, 1856, Jones and Donalson neared the town. A large force was stationed on the high ground at Hogback Ridge, and a cannon was placed to cover and command the area. The house of Charles L. Robinson (later to become the first governor of Kansas) was taken over as Jones&#x27;s headquarters. Every road to the town and on the opposite side of the river was guarded by Jones&#x27;s men, to prevent the free-soilers from fleeing. A number of flags were flown by Jones&#x27;s men, such as the state banners of Alabama and South Carolina, a flag with black and white stripes, and flags bearing pro-slavery, inflammatory inscriptions, such as &quot;Southern Rights&quot; and &quot;Supremacy of the White Race&quot;).

Shalor Eldridge, proprietor of the Free State Hotel, soon learned of the oncoming forces, and he journeyed out to meet them; he was told by Donalson that the posse would enter into Lawrence and attack if and only if the citizens tried to resist Donalson and Jones&#x27;s men. Donalson and Eldridge then journeyed to the hotel, where, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Eldridge had prepared &quot;an elegant dinner, the best that the fresh and abundant stores in the cellar could afford&quot; (which included &quot;costly wines&quot;) so as to placate the marshal and his men. Eldridge was interviewed by Donalson while the federal agent and his followers ravenously consumed the meal, then left without paying. Shortly afterwards, the marshal dismissed his followers, who were immediately deputized by Jones. Jones then asked to speak to a representative of the town. Samuel C. Pomeroy (who, along with Charles Robinson, had led the second group of settlers to the Lawrence city site in 1854) agreed to meet with the sheriff and discuss with him the situation at hand. Jones was clear in what he wanted: for the citizens of Lawrence to surrender all of their weapons. Pomeroy replied that he did not have the power to do this, as it was ultimately up to individual citizens to give up their arms. However, hoping to encourage Jones to leave the city peacefully, Pomeroy agreed to turn over the city&#x27;s only artillery piece. While Jones did seize this cannon, it did not appease him, as Pomeroy had hoped. According to the Lawrence minister Richard Cordley:

As soon as Jones had possession of the cannon and other arms, he proceeded to carry out his purpose to destroy the Free-State Hotel. He gave the inmates till five o’clock to get out their personal effects. When all was ready he turned [the posse&#x27;s very own] cannon upon the hotel and fired. The first ball went completely over the roof, at which all the people cheered, much to the disgust of Jones. The next shot hit the walls but did little damage. After bombarding away with little or no effect till it was becoming monotonous, they attempted to blow up the building with a keg of powder. But this only made a big noise and a big smoke, and did not do much towards demolishing the house. At every failure the citizen spectators along the street set up a shout. At last Jones became desperate, and applied the vulgar torch, and burned the building to the ground. [...] Jones was exultant. His revenge was complete. &quot;This is the happiest moment of my life,&quot; he shouted as the walls of the hotel fell. He had made the &quot;fanatics bow to him in the dust.&quot; He then dismissed his posse and left.

It was the &quot;Old Sacramento&quot; cannon that the pro-slavery forces made use of in their initial attempt to bring down the Free State Hotel. This weapon had been stored at the Liberty Arsenal until then. The cannon would be recaptured by free-staters on August 12, 1856, during the Second Battle of Franklin.

While Jones and his men were trying to bring down the hotel, the printing offices of the &quot;Kansas Free State&quot; and the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot; newspapers were destroyed. The machinery was smashed, the type was thrown in the river, their libraries were thrown out the window, and loose copies were either thrown into the wind to be carried off, or used by Jones&#x27;s party to set fire to the Free State Hotel. When the newspapers were obliterated and the hotel had been brought to the ground, Jones&#x27;s men then looted the half-deserted town. As they retreated, for good measure they burned Robinson&#x27;s home on Hogback Ridge.

One person—a member of Jones&#x27;s gang—died during the attack, when he was struck in the head by a collapsing bit of the Free State Hotel.

After &quot;Old Sacramento&quot; was recaptured, the free-stater Thomas Bickerton scavenged the lead type from the river and used it to make cannonballs.

==Aftermath==

While the Free State Hotel was destroyed, Shalor Eldridge purchased the charred remnants of the structure and rebuilt it as the &quot;Eldridge House&quot;. This building remained a fixture of Lawrence until 1863, when it was burned down by William Quantrill during the Lawrence Massacre (after which it would be rebuilt two more times, in 1866 and 1926).

For a number of months after the Sack of Lawrence, the city was without a free state newspaper. This was exacerbated by the fact that Josiah Miller, who ran the &quot;Kansas Free State&quot;, decided not to start his former paper up again. The lack of a Lawrence-based news source ended when George Brown restarted the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot; in November.

The Sack of Lawrence resulted in the loss of the city&#x27;s only cannon. This would be at least one reason that Free-Staters would attack Franklin&#x27;s Fort in June and August of 1856, as they hoped to secure the &quot;Old Sacramento&quot; cannon for their own use.

<text>The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA or AAHK) is the statutory body of the government of Hong Kong that is responsible for the operations of the Hong Kong International Airport. It is governed by the Airport Authority Ordinance (Cap. 483).

==History==
The authority was formed on 1 December 1995 (initially as the Provisional Airport Authority in 1990) through Airport Authority Ordinance and is independent of the government financially. There are plans to corporatise the AA and to list it on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and to partially sell it to the public.

A convention and exhibition facility, the AsiaWorld–Expo, on the northeastern corner of the island of Chek Lap Kok was opened on 21 December 2005.

On 17 January 2005, the AA acquired 49% stake of Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, with HK$ 1.99 billion, compared to bids by Singapore Changi Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Houston International Airport and BAA plc. A new holding company of Xiaoshan Airport will be formed and be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

On 17 February 2006, the AA confirmed it will hold 55% stake in a company that operates the Zhuhai Airport, with the remaining 45% owned by Zhuhai Airport. The company will not own the assets or the liabilities of the airport.

In 2017, the Airport Authority approved a HKD $140 billion (US$18 billion) expansion for Hong Kong International Airport.

In 2023, as part of COVID-19 recovery following the relaxation of the Government&#x27;s travel restrictions, the Airport Authority announced a &quot;World of Winners&quot; campaign. The campaign aimed to provide 500,000 heavily subsidised tickets to promote tourism in Hong Kong. The airlines providing the tickets were Cathay Pacific, HK Express, Hong Kong Airlines and Greater Bay Airlines, and these airlines determined the allocation of the tickets.

==Operations==
AAHK is headquartered at HKIA Tower, which is connected to the airport terminal. The Airport Authority employs 2,900 staff in total.

==CCTV controversy==
In March 2013 an airline passenger witnessed a suspected theft in the baggage reclaim hall of Chek Lap Kok Airport. He reported the theft to airport staff, who did nothing. The passenger then contacted the Airport Authority to enquire on the availability of CCTV footage of the incident. Airport Authority staff responded that the cameras were used only for real-time monitoring.

Legislative councillor Alice Mak asked for clarification on behalf of the passenger. It was revealed that the CCTV system does have a recording function. The AAHK added that &quot;the staff concerned, who were not honest in this instance, have been suitably admonished&quot;.

The case was investigated by the Office of the Ombudsman, which released a report in January 2015. The report noted that the AAHK training material instructs staff to answer enquiries about CCTV with the response, &quot;CCTVs are used for real time surveillance only&quot;, which is a lie. The Ombudsman alleged that &quot;AA’s statement that the staff concerned were not honest was therefore grossly unfair&quot; and that &quot;we consider knowingly constructing a standard response which contains false information totally unacceptable.&quot; The Ombudsman considered the complaint against AAHK substantiated and recommended the authority review its CCTV policies and procedures and provide customer service training that &quot;would not compromise the honesty and transparency of AA.&quot; The Airport Authority responded that the incident was isolated, and that it had implemented the recommendations made by the Ombudsman.

<doc id="1335320" wikidata="Q1044168" url="?curid=1335320" title="World TeamTennis">
<text>World TeamTennis (WTT) was a mixed-gender professional tennis league played with a team format in the United States, which was founded in 1973.

The league&#x27;s season normally took place in the summer months. Players from the ATP and WTA would often take a break from their tour schedules to partake in World TeamTennis.

WTT was the first professional sports league to grant equal status to each man and woman competing for their teams.

Many top tennis players have participated in the league over the years, including Billie Jean King, Rod Laver, Björn Borg, Ilie Nastase, Chris Evert, John McEnroe, Evonne Goolagong, Jimmy Connors, Martina Navratilova, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang, Serena Williams, Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Kim Clijsters, Martina Hingis, John Isner, Sam Querrey, Sloane Stephens, Naomi Osaka, and Frances Tiafoe.

== Format ==
Originally played on a no-line court, each match consisted of five sets. Each set featured a different configuration (men&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s doubles, women&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles). Prior to each match, coaches would decide the order in which the sets would be played. Each player on a team usually played in at least one of the five sets. Scoring was no-advantage; there was no requirement to win a game by two points; at deuce, whoever scores the next point wins the game. The first team to reach five games wins each set. A nine-point tiebreaker is played if a set reaches four-all. One point is awarded for each game won. If necessary, extended play and a supertiebreaker were played to determine the winner of the match.

The original league format included a four-colored tennis court, a 44-contest season, and teams of at least two men and two women. A match consisted of the first player or team to win five games, with a nine-point tiebreaker at four-all, and no-ad scoring in women&#x27;s singles and doubles, men&#x27;s singles and doubles, and mixed doubles.

==Courts==
For much of World Team Tennis&#x27; history, its distinct court was an instant symbol for fans to recognize what they were watching. The iconic four-color (calico) court originated in the early 1970s and was unveiled for the third season in 1976. It was originally created to eliminate court lines (no-line court). Originally, the service boxes were blue and green, the baseline area brown and the doubles alleys maroon. These colors were chosen to represent the different tennis court surfaces: green for grass, blue for hard, maroon for clay and brown for dirt.

The league&#x27;s technicolor playing surface served as a trendsetter for the rest of the tennis world. The Indian Wells Masters has purple courts.

Over time, lines were introduced to WTT&#x27;s courts, purple replaced the brown and they reverted to traditional solid-colored courts. But in 2006, the league returned full-time to the signature calico/checkerboard pattern.

In 2019, the league made efforts to modernize and update its look and branding, including a switch to a deep blue playing surface and gray outer court. In partnership with DecoTurf, these colors were determined to be the best for livestreaming and television.

==First league==

=== Founding ===
WTT was founded in 1973 by Dennis Murphy, Dick Butera, Fred Barman, Jordan Kaiser, and attorney and promoter Larry King, each of whom organized and owned the various participating teams of the fledgling professional tennis league. Murphy had previously founded the World Hockey Association, and gave a number of WHA club owners preferential options on WTT franchises.

Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Reichblum (now popularly known as &quot;Dr. Knowledge&quot;), industrialist John H. Hillman III, and lawyer William &quot;Bill&quot; Sutton, who became the owners of the Pittsburgh Triangles, had, in 1972, founded the similar National Tennis League (NTL), a forerunner to WTT and Reichblum&#x27;s brainchild. Founding members of WTT were reported to have been invited to join the NTL prior to formation of the competing WTT in 1973.

===Teams, 1974–1978===
In 1974, Billie Jean King began the first WTT season by securing the professional women tennis players. Dr. Leonard Bloom, Arthur Ashe, and Wilt Chamberlain helped to secure the professional men tennis players. Two WTT players, Connors and Goolagong, were not allowed to participate in the 1974 French Open due to their associations with WTT. Connors&#x27; exclusion from the French Open denied him the opportunity to become the first male player since Rod Laver to win all four Major singles titles in a calendar year.

The league began play in May 1974, with George MacCall as Commissioner of the 16 teams, many with tennis-themed nicknames. The Eastern Division consisted of the Atlantic Section: Baltimore Banners, Boston Lobsters, New York Sets, Philadelphia Freedoms; and the Central Section: Cleveland Nets, Detroit Loves, Pittsburgh Triangles, Toronto-Buffalo Royals. The Western Division consisted of the Gulf Plains Section: Chicago Aces, Florida Flamingos, Houston E-Z Riders, Minnesota Buckskins; and the Pacific Section: Denver Racquets, Hawaii Leis, Los Angeles Strings, San Francisco Golden Gaters.

Following the initial 1974 season several teams moved, folded, or failed to meet the financial requirements of the league, and the league also added one expansion team, the San Diego Friars. For the 1975 season World Team Tennis consisted of 10 teams, and it remained with that number of teams throughout the rest of the existence of the first league.

The teams that played from 1974 to 1978 were:
* Boston Lobsters (1974)
* Chicago Aces (1974)
* Cincinnati (never played) / Cleveland Nets (1974–1976) / Cleveland-Pittsburgh Nets (1977) / New Orleans Sun Belt Nets (1978)
* Dallas (1979 expansion franchise – never played)
* Denver Racquets (1974) / Phoenix Racquets (1975–1978)
* Detroit Loves (1974) / Indiana Loves (1975–1978)
* Golden Gate Otters (never played) / San Francisco Golden Gaters (1974–1978)
* Houston E-Z Riders (1974)
* Los Angeles (1979 expansion franchise – never played)
* Los Angeles Strings (1974–1978)
* Minnesota Buckskins (1974)
* New York Sets (1974–1976) / New York Apples (1977–1978)
* Pennsylvania Keystones (never played) / Soviet National Team (1977, often simply called &quot;The Soviets&quot;) / Anaheim Oranges (1978)
* Philadelphia Freedoms (1974) / Boston Lobsters (1975–1978) (Elton John, a friend of Billie Jean King, wrote the hit single &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; as a theme song for his favorite team.)
* Phoenix (never played) / Baltimore Banners (1974)
* Pittsburgh Triangles (1974–1976)
* St. Louis (never played) / Florida Flamingos (1974)
* San Diego (1979 expansion franchise – never played)
* San Diego Friars (1975–1978)
* San Diego Swingers (never played) / Hawaii Leis (1974–1976) / Sea-Port Cascades (1977) / Seattle Cascades (1978)
* Toronto-Buffalo Royals (1974) / Hartford Royals (never played)

WTT was the first professional sports experience for Jerry Buss (eventual owner of the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings), and for Bob Kraft (eventual owner of the NFL&#x27;s New England Patriots and MLS&#x27;s New England Revolution).

=== All-star games and MVPs ===
WTT also held annual All-Star games for the seasons from 1975 to 1978. Marty Riessen (Cleveland) and Greer Stevens (Boston) won Most Valuable Players (MVP) honors for the inaugural all-star gala won by the East, 28–21, at the Inglewood Forum in Los Angeles. In 1976 the West All-Stars, led by Chris Evert and Betty Stöve, capped an incredible comeback when they defeated Billie Jean King and Evonne Goolagong in a super tiebreaker, 5–4, giving the West a stunning 28–27 overtime victory at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. After trailing at one stage by 24–17, the West, led by Stove and Dianne Fromholtz, won the final set plus two games in overtime to draw the West All-Stars even at 27. Tom Okker (San Francisco) and Dianne Fromholtz (Los Angeles) won MVP honors that year. In the 1977 All Star Game held at the San Diego Sports Arena, Björn Borg (Cleveland–Pittsburgh) and Betty Stöve (Seattle–Portland) captured MVP awards as the East bested the West, 23–18. WTT held its final All-Star event in Las Vegas in 1978.

=== Ending ===
The first league ended play in 1978.

== Second league ==

=== 1981–1991 ===
League play resumed in 1981 as TeamTennis, with four California teams, expanding to eight teams in 1982. In 2005, the league had twelve teams.

In 1984, Billie Jean King became Commissioner and major owner of the league, following her retirement from tournament tennis competition.

In 1985 a recreational league for non-professionals was added, which was co-branded with the professional league.

===1992–1999===
In 1992, the name of the league was changed back to World TeamTennis.
* Minnesota Penguins, 1993
* Idaho Sneakers, 1994–1997
* New Jersey Stars, 1987–1995 (relocated and became the Delaware Smash)
* Phoenix Smash, 1992–1994

===2000–2021===
In 2000 the current logo was adopted. In February 2001, Billie Jean King retired as commissioner and Ilana Kloss became the new commissioner.

In 2005 and 2006 the league consisted of 12 teams and in 2007 the Hartford FoxForce ceased operations. Prior to the 2008 season, the Houston Wranglers ceased operations and the Washington Kastles joined the league. In the 2009 season, 10 teams competed: Boston, New York Buzz, New York Sportime, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Kansas City, Newport Beach, Sacramento, Springfield, and St. Louis. Sacramento won the year-end championship six times.

Before the start of the 2011 season the New York Buzz and the New York Sportimes merged into one New York team, the Sportimes. During the 2011 season the Washington Kastles completed a perfect 16–0 schedule, winning their second championship in three seasons.

In 2012, the Washington Kastles completed their second consecutive perfect season, going 16–0 for the second season in a row to become the first professional sports franchise to go two complete seasons without a loss. Their 32-match winning streak is one shy of the major professional sports record of 33 consecutive wins set by the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association. They began the next season with 2 wins making their streak 34 games, setting the new record.

In 2013, World TeamTennis was renamed Mylan World TeamTennis after Mylan, a generics and specialty pharmaceuticals company, signed a three-year deal as the title sponsor. The Kansas City Explorers relocated to Irving, Texas, and became the Texas Wild. On November 21, 2013, the Orange County Breakers were sold, relocated to Austin, Texas and renamed the Austin Aces. On January 16, 2014, the New York Sportimes were sold, relocated to San Diego and renamed the San Diego Aviators. On February 4, 2014, the Sacramento Capitals were relocated to Las Vegas and renamed the Las Vegas Neon. On March 5, 2014, the Las Vegas Neon franchise was terminated, leaving the league with seven teams.

On February 23, 2015, WTT announced that a new ownership group had taken control of the Texas Wild and moved the team to Citrus Heights, California, renaming it the California Dream.

On January 13, 2016, WTT announced that the California Dream franchise had been terminated. On February 17, 2016, the Boston Lobsters had ceased operations and had been replaced with a new franchise called the New York Empire.

In March 2017, Billie Jean King announced the sale of her majority share in WTT to venture capitalist Mark Ein, the founder and owner of the Washington Kastles, and Fred Luddy, the founder of ServiceNow and owner of the San Diego Aviators.

In January 2019, Carlos Silva became the CEO and ushered in new deals with CBS and ESPN creating the largest-ever audience for WTT on July 21, 2019, on a CBS broadcast.

In March 2019, the league announced its expansion to eight teams for the 2019 season, with the creation of the Orlando Storm and the Vegas Rollers.

On October 23, 2019, the league announced it would be awarding a record $5 million in prize money, including an additional $1 million for the postseason, during its 45th season and would be expanding again, adding two new franchises in 2020.

In February 2020, the league announced its expansion to nine teams for the 2020 season with the Chicago Smash.

In June 2020, WTT announced it would be the first major professional tennis league to resume operations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The league committed to play the entirety of its 45th season at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia from July 12 through August 2.

In March 2021, Carlos Silva stepped down as CEO. The current COO is Allen Hardison. The 2021 season was November 13–28 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.

WTT announced it would not hold a 2022 season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they promised to return in 2023 with new expansion teams, but , this has not occurred.

<text>Zacharie Robutel de La Noue (June 4, 1665 – 1733) was a French lieutenant and captain in the colonial regular troops, and seigneur of Châteauguay. Robutel de La Noue was a Canadian, born in Montreal, son of Claude Robutel de La Noue, seigneur of Île Saint-Paul, and Suzanne de Gabrielle. As a soldier he escorted various expeditions - to Hudson Bay in 1686 with Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes and up the Ottawa River in 1692. He also led military attacks on Mohawk villages in 1692–93. He was sent by governor Vaudreuil in July 1717 to establish a chain of three posts from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods, but he was only able to re-establish a fur trading post, Fort Kaministiquia, on the Kaministiquia River. He remained there as commandant until 1721.

He died at Baie des Puants (Green Bay, Wisconsin) in 1733.

<doc id="1335332" wikidata="Q10854414" url="?curid=1335332" title="ARINC">
<text>Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC), established in 1929, was a major provider of transport communications and systems engineering solutions for eight industries: aviation, airports, defense, government, healthcare, networks, security, and transportation. ARINC had installed computer data networks in police cars and railroad cars and also maintains the standards for line-replaceable units.

ARINC was formerly headquartered in Annapolis, Maryland, and had two regional headquarters in London, established in 1999 to serve the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, and Singapore, established in 2003 for the Asia Pacific region. ARINC had more than 3,200 employees at over 120 locations worldwide.

The sale of the company by Carlyle Group to Rockwell Collins was completed on December 23, 2013, and from November 2018 onward operates as part of Collins Aerospace.

==History==

ARINC was incorporated in 1929 as Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated. It was chartered by the Federal Radio Commission (which later became the Federal Communications Commission) in order to serve as the airline industry&#x27;s single licensee and coordinator of radio communication outside of the government. The corporation&#x27;s stock was held by four major airlines of the day. Through most of its history, ARINC was owned by airlines and other aviation-related companies such as Boeing until the sale to The Carlyle Group in October 2007.

Not much later ARINC took on the responsibility for all ground-based, aeronautical radio stations and for ensuring station compliance with Federal Radio Commission (FRC) rules and regulations. Using this as a base technology, ARINC expanded its contributions to transport communications as well as continuing to support the commercial aviation industry and U.S. military.

ARINC also developed the standards for the trays and boxes used to hold standard line-replaceable units (like radios) in aircraft. This subsequently allowed electronics to be rapidly replaced without complex fasteners or test equipment.

In 1978 ARINC introduced ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System), a datalink system that enables ground stations (airports, aircraft maintenance bases, etc.) to upload data (such as flight plans) and download data (such as fuel quantity, weight on wheels, flight management system (FMS) data), via an onboard Communications Management Unit (CMU).

ARINC has expanded its business in aerospace and defense through its ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary. With the sale of the company to Rockwell Collins, the ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary split into Commercial Aerospace and Defense Services. The Defense Services branch was then purchased by Booz Allen Hamilton, remaining part of the Carlyle group.

The sale of a Standards Development Organization (SDP) to a corporate sponsor raised concerns of conflict of interest and resulted in the sale of the ARINC Industry Activities (IA) Division to SAE International in January 2014. It now operates under the SAE Industry Technologies Consortia (SAE ITC).

United Technologies completed its acquisition of Rockwell Collins in November 2018 and merged it with its UTC Aerospace Systems to form Collins Aerospace.

==Activities and services==
Though known for publishing &quot;ARINC Standards&quot;, this role is independent of ARINC commercial activities.

===Standardization and ARINC Industry Activities===
ARINC Industry Activities involve three aviation committees:
* AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee): Develop the ARINC Standards,
* AMC (Avionics Maintenance Conference): Organize the annual Avionics Maintenance Conference,
* FSEMC (Flight Simulator Engineering &amp; Maintenance Conference): Organize the annual FSEMC conference.

===ARINC services===

<text>Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz (; August 5, 1872 – February 11, 1917), was a Brazilian physician, pioneer bacteriologist, epidemiologist and public health officer and the founder of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute.

He occupied the fifth chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1912 until his death in 1917.

==Early years==
Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz was born on August 5, 1872, in São Luis do Paraitinga, a small city in São Paulo Province, to the physician Bento Gonçalvez Cruz and Amália Bulhões Cruz. As a child, he moved to Rio de Janeiro with his family. At the age of 15 he started to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro and in 1892 he graduated as a medical doctor, with a thesis on water as vehicle for the propagation of microbes. Inspired by the work of Louis Pasteur, who had developed the germ theory of disease, four years later he went to Paris to specialize in bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute, which gathered the great names of this branch of science of that time. He was financed by his father-in-law, a wealthy Portuguese merchant.

==Career==

===Work in Brazil===
Cruz found that the seaport of Santos was ravaged by an epidemic of bubonic plague that threatened to reach Rio de Janeiro, and engaged himself immediately in the combat of this disease. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro authorized the construction of a plant for manufacturing the serum against the disease which had been developed at the Pasteur Institute by Alexandre Yersin and coworkers. He asked the institution for a scientist who could bring this know-how to Brazil. The Pasteur Institute responded that such a person was already available in Brazil: Oswaldo Cruz.

On May 25, 1900, the Federal Serum Therapy Institute was created, intended for the production of sera and vaccines against the bubonic plague, with Baron Pedro Afonso as director general and the young bacteriologist Oswaldo Cruz as technical director. The new institute was established in the old farm of Manguinhos at the western shores of Guanabara Bay. In 1902, Cruz accepted the office of director general of the institute and soon expanded the scope of its activities, now no longer restricted to the production of sera but also dedicated to basic and applied research and to the building of human resources. In the following year, Cruz was appointed director general of Public Health, a position corresponding to today&#x27;s Brazilian Minister of Health.

Using the Federal Serum Therapy Institute as a technical-scientific base, he embarked on a quick succession of important sanitation campaigns. His first challenge was a series of yellow fever endemics, which had earned Rio de Janeiro the sinister reputation of &#x27;Foreigners&#x27; Grave&#x27;. Between 1897 and 1906, 4,000 European immigrants had died there from the disease. Cruz pursued the new technique of eradicating mosquitoes and their breeding grounds, fumigating houses, and isolation of the ill. There was opposition to the campaign by many, including physicians, the military, and the poor, but the campaign was successful. Cruz was initially successful in the sanitary campaign against the bubonic plague, to which end he used obligatory notification of cases, isolation of sick people, treatment with the sera produced at Manguinhos and extermination of the rats populating the city.

===Smallpox vaccination controversy===
He was not successful in implementing a widespread vaccination against smallpox, due to popular resistance to it. In 1904, a smallpox epidemic was threatening the capital. In the first five months of the year, more than 1,800 people had been hospitalized. A law imposing smallpox vaccination of children had existed since 1837 but had never been put into practice. Therefore, on June 9, 1904, following a proposal by Oswaldo Cruz, the government presented a bill to the Congress requesting the reestablishment of obligatory smallpox vaccination. The extremely rigid and severe provisions of this instrument terrified the people. Popular opposition against Cruz increased sharply and opposition newspapers started a violent campaign against this and the federal government in general. Members of the parliament and labor unions protested. An anti-vaccination league was organized.

On November 10, the Vaccine Revolt exploded in Rio. Violent confrontations with the police ensued, with strikes, barricades, and shootings in the streets, as the population rose in protest against the government. On November 14, the cadets of the Military Academy joined the revolt, but were dispersed after intense shooting. The government declared a state of siege. On November 16, the uprising was controlled, but the obligatory vaccination was suspended.

In 1908, a violent smallpox epidemic made the people rush en masse to the vaccination units. Some 9,000 people died. Cruz was vindicated and his merit recognized.

===Later work===
Among the international scientific community, his prestige was already uncontested. In 1907, on occasion of the 14th International Congress on Hygiene and Demography in Berlin, Cruz was awarded with the gold medal in recognition of the sanitation of Rio de Janeiro. In 1909, he retired from the position as director general for Public Health, dedicating himself exclusively to the Manguinhos Institute, which has been named after him. From the institute he organized important scientific expeditions, which allowed a better knowledge about the health and life conditions in the interior of the country and contributed to the colonization of regions. Cruz eradicated urban yellow fever in the state of Pará. His sanitation campaign in the state of Amazonas allowed the completion of construction of the Madeira-Mamoré railroad, which had been interrupted due to the great number of deaths from malaria and yellow fever among the workers.

In 1913, Cruz was elected a member of the Brazilian Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1915, due to health problems, he resigned from the directorship of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute and moved to Petrópolis, a small city in the mountains near Rio. On August 18, 1916, he was elected mayor of that city and outlined an extensive urbanization project he would not see implemented.

==Death and legacy==
In the morning of February 11, 1917, at 44 years of age, he died of kidney failure in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro state.

As a consequence of the short, fruitful life of Oswaldo Cruz, an extremely important scientific and health institution was born, which marked the beginning of experimental medicine in Brazil in many areas. To this day it exerts a strong influence on Brazilian science, technology and public health.

In Brazil, several neighborhoods, schools, and public institutions are named after him. Some examples are the neighborhood of Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, the Rodovia Oswaldo Cruz in São Paulo, and the aforementioned health institute Oswaldo Cruz Foundation.

<doc id="1335337" wikidata="Q374702" url="?curid=1335337" title="Chris Hogg">
<text>Christopher Francis Hogg (born 12 March 1985) is an English former footballer. He is currently the Assistant Head Coach of EFL Championship club Bristol City.

Hogg started his career with the York City youth system in 1997, captaining England at under-15 level. He signed for the FA Premier League team Ipswich Town for a compensation fee of £150,000 in June 2001. Hogg was twice loaned to the Third Division club Boston United before, because of financial restrictions at Ipswich, he was transferred to Hibernian in January 2005.

Hogg initially struggled to establish himself in the Hibernian first team, but he started to win a regular place from January 2007 under the management of John Collins. Hogg was made captain at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, after Rob Jones moved to Scunthorpe United. Hogg lost his place in the Hibernian team during the 2010–11 season, however, and subsequently moved to Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

==Playing career==

===Ipswich Town===
Born in Middlesbrough, Hogg was educated at Conyers School, Yarm. He started his career with the York City youth system in 1997 and had a trial at Manchester United in 2000. He signed for FA Premier League team Ipswich Town for an initial six-figure compensation fee on 29 June 2001. The fee has since been reported as £150,000. He signed a professional contract with Ipswich on 12 August 2002.

====Boston United (loans)====
Hogg joined the Third Division team Boston United on a one-month loan on 9 October 2003. He made his debut two days later in a 3–1 victory over Cheltenham Town. He made eight appearances before returning to Ipswich in November. He rejoined Boston on another one-month loan on 12 December and made five appearances during this spell, leaving the club in February 2004.

===Hibernian===
Because of the financial restrictions at Ipswich, Hogg was transferred to the Scottish Premier League club Hibernian on 31 January 2005, even though he was unavailable for two months. This was due to Hogg being severely injured whilst trying to prevent a car robbery in Middlesbrough earlier that month. Tony Mowbray, who was then the manager of Hibernian, was aware of Hogg from his time coaching at Ipswich. He made his debut in a 4–0 defeat to Hearts on 7 August. He signed a new contract with Hibernian in October that would expire in June 2009, with Mowbray saying &quot;Chris is a model professional for a young man of 20. He deserves his new deal and I know there&#x27;s more to come.&quot;

Hogg initially struggled to establish himself in the Hibernian first team, but he started to win a regular place from January 2007 under the management of John Collins. He played in the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final against Kilmarnock, which Hibernian won 5–1. Hogg formed a solid defensive partnership with the captain Rob Jones, and in June 2007 he signed a contract with Hibernian until June 2011. Hogg was made vice-captain at the start of the 2007–08 season following the departure of Scott Brown to Celtic. Hogg was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Year by both the fans and his fellow players at the end of the 2007–08 season.

During the early part of the 2008–09 season, Hogg played on for over a month despite suffering from concussion. After spending a few weeks resting, he admitted that he had been &quot;foolish&quot; to initially play on, in a desire to retain his first team place. Hogg was made the new captain at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, after Rob Jones moved to Scunthorpe United. Despite his status as captain, Hogg was dropped from the starting line-up early in the 2010–11 season to make way for new signing Francis Dickoh, who made his debut in a 1–1 draw against Inverness CT. the Hibernian manager John Hughes praised the performance of Dickoh, who offered a greater physical presence. After Hughes left the club in October, Hogg was reinstated to the starting line-up at right-back by the caretaker management team of Gareth Evans and Alistair Stevenson against Kilmarnock. Hogg scored the two goals that gave Hibs a 2–1 win. It was the first time in over four years that Hogg had scored a goal, his only previous senior goal also being scored against Kilmarnock.

Hogg lost his place in the team soon afterwards, however, and on 31 January 2011 he was released from his contract.

===Inverness Caledonian Thistle===
Hogg signed a short-term deal for Inverness Caledonian Thistle after he was released from his contract by Hibernian. He scored a goal on his debut for Inverness, in a Scottish Cup tie against Morton. Hogg left Inverness at the end of the 2010–11 season.

Following a spell training with his home town club, Middlesbrough, and a trial with Crewe Alexandra, he re-signed with Inverness on a one-year contract on 29 July. Hogg suffered what appeared to be a serious knee injury in a match against Dundee United on 10 December 2011. His manager, Terry Butcher, described it as &quot;one of the worst knee injuries we&#x27;ve seen&quot;. After a successful operation on his knee, Hogg was offered a new contract by Inverness in January 2012. Hogg made his first competitive appearance since recovering from injury on 4 May 2013, in a 4–3 win against Motherwell. Hogg&#x27;s contract with Inverness CT expired at the end of the 2012–13 season. He elected to leave the club despite being offered a one-year extension.

In January 2014, Hogg signed for Needham Market. He left Needham in September 2015 to take up a full-time coaching role within the Ipswich Town Academy.

===International===
While a York player he captained England at under-15 level, making his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Northern Ireland on 20 October 2000 in the Victory Shield. He made another appearance in the Victory Shield, also playing three games in the Walkers Under-15 Tournament and four games at the Montaigu Tournament. He made his under-17 debut after starting a 2–1 defeat to Italy on 12 July 2001 and went on to score his first goal in a 2–2 draw with Slovakia on 13 February 2002. He then played for the under-17s at the 2002 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship and played in five of a possible six games, with England finishing the tournament in third place. Hogg finished his time with the side with 11 caps and two goals. His debut for the under-18 team came after starting in a 4–0 victory over Tunisia on 14 November. He then played in three of England&#x27;s four games at the 2003 Meridian Cup and his last appearance at this level came in a 0–0 draw with Switzerland on 12 March 2003. Hogg&#x27;s debut for the under-19s was a 3–2 defeat to Germany on 24 April and went on to make a further three appearances for the side.

===Style of play===
Hogg played as a centre back and was described as &quot;solid and self-reliant&quot;. The Crewe Alexandra manager, Dario Gradi, described Hogg as &quot;decent in the air&quot;, despite his relative lack of height for a centre back.

==Coaching career==
Hogg retired from playing in 2015 to take up a full-time coaching role within the Ipswich Town Academy. He subsequently worked for their under-18 and under-23 teams, and was added to the first team coaching staff during the 2018–19 season. Hogg moved to Newcastle United in February 2020, working with their under-23 team.

On 13 August 2021, Hogg was appointed Assistant Head Coach of League One side Milton Keynes Dons, assisting the newly appointed Liam Manning. Following a poor start to the season, Hogg departed the club alongside Manning on 11 December 2022.

In March 2023, following Manning&#x27;s appointment at Oxford United, Hogg again followed him as assistant head coach.

On 7 November 2023, Hogg followed Manning as his assistant once again at Championship club Bristol City.

<text>Andrew Tobias (born April 20, 1947) is an American writer. He has written extensively about investment, as well as politics, insurance, and other topics. He is also known for writing &quot;The Best Little Boy in the World&quot;, a 1973 memoir – originally pseudonymous – about life as a gay man. From 1999 until 2017, he was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.

==Education==
Tobias graduated from Harvard College in 1968 with a BA in Slavic languages and literatures. In 1972, he obtained his Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School.

== Writing ==

While in business school, he wrote for &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, and after graduation became a contributing editor.

In 1973, Tobias wrote &quot;The Best Little Boy in the World&quot;, an autobiography in which he spoke of his experiences as a gay boy and young man. He published it under the pen name &quot;John Reid&quot; to avoid the repercussions of being openly gay, though the book was republished in 1998 under his real name, to coincide with a sequel, &quot;The Best Little Boy in the World Grows Up&quot;.

Although he has never held a job in the investment industry, he has written extensively on the subject, including &quot;The Only Investment Guide You&#x27;ll Ever Need&quot;, &quot;The Only Other Investment Guide You&#x27;ll Ever Need&quot;, &quot;My Vast Fortune&quot;, &quot;Money Angles&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Bankers: Everything the Insurance Industry Never Wanted You to Know&quot;, and &quot;The Funny Money Game&quot;. He parlayed his writings and advice into success in the software industry with his &quot;Andrew Tobias&#x27;s Managing Your Money&quot; financial application.

Tobias has written books on other topics, which include &quot;Fire and Ice: The Charles Revson/Revlon Story&quot;, &quot;Getting By on $100,000 a Year&quot;, a collection of magazine pieces; &quot;Auto Insurance Alert&quot;, a book proposing radical insurance reform; &quot;Kids Say Don&#x27;t Smoke&quot; on the efforts of tobacco companies to sell cigarettes to younger consumers (which was also published in Russian).

After leaving &quot;New York Magazine&quot; in 1976, he was a contributing editor to &quot;Esquire&quot;, then &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Parade&quot;.

Since 1996, he has posted a daily column at AndrewTobias.com. 

== Politics ==
In 1999, he became treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.

He spearheaded a ballot initiative to convert California&#x27;s auto insurance system into a no-fault system which would be paid for through a gasoline surcharge instead of premiums. He wrote a book on the topic. He also funded a large part of the campaign himself.

== Personal life ==
Tobias was the partner of fashion designer and Democratic political activist Charles Nolan, who died on January 30, 2011.

Tobias was grand marshal of the 2005 New York City LGBT Pride parade.

He was president and CEO of Harvard Student Agencies in 1967–68 while residing in Winthrop House.

Tobias was interviewed in Jill Salvino&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Between the Shades&quot;.

<doc id="1335341" wikidata="Q2777623" url="?curid=1335341" title="Flag of Ottawa">
<text>The official flag of Ottawa is highlighted by a stylized white &quot;O&quot; design. This stylized O is meant to represent both a maple leaf (symbolizing Canada) and the Peace Tower and Centre Block of the parliament buildings (symbolizing Ottawa). The design is meant to be simple, but look festive, and to create a feeling of vibrant motion when flying.

The design uses the blue and teal colours chosen to represent the new City of Ottawa. The blue is symbolic of rivers and waterways that are part of the Ottawa region, such as the Ottawa River. The large teal areas speak to the large green space and quality of life in the area, as well as the forests, trees, and parkland within the city. It was adopted January 1, 2000, following the creation of the Ottawa &quot;megacity&quot;.

== History ==
Previously the Ottawa flag had been a purple, red and blue tricolour. This flag was adopted by the city in 1901 and when replaced, it was the oldest municipal flag in Canada. The three colours were intended to represent purple for the monarchy, red for the Liberals, and blue for the Conservatives. The flag was not popular, however, with few liking its appearance. It also violated rules of heraldry by placing colour next to colour. In 1987, in an attempt to spruce it up, the city&#x27;s coat of arms was added to the centre. There was little controversy when the transition board decided the new city should get a new flag.

<doc id="1335350" wikidata="Q1132214" url="?curid=1335350" title="Worst Episode Ever">
<text>&quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; is the eleventh episode of the twelfth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 4, 2001. In the episode, Bart and Milhouse are banned from The Android&#x27;s Dungeon after stopping Comic Book Guy from buying a box of priceless &quot;Star Wars&quot; memorabilia for $5. However, when Comic Book Guy suffers a massive heart attack, he hires Bart and Milhouse as his replacements while he leaves his job to pursue a relationship with Agnes Skinner.

&quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Matthew Nastuk. The series&#x27; staff found it hard to make Comic Book Guy seem likable, since he is usually portrayed as sarcastic and unfriendly. The episode features special make-up effects artist and actor Tom Savini as himself.

In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by about 10 million viewers, finishing in 27th place in the ratings the week it aired. In contrast to the title of the episode, it received positive reviews from critics since its broadcast, and Hank Azaria won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Comic Book Guy in the episode.

==Plot==
Bart wins a $50 bet against Homer after the latter fails to eat an entire box of spoiled baking soda that Lisa finds in the back of the refrigerator. As Bart and Milhouse spend the money, they enter The Android&#x27;s Dungeon and find Martin Prince&#x27;s mother trying to make a deal with Comic Book Guy to sell her son&#x27;s collection of &quot;Star Wars&quot; memorabilia while Martin is at fat camp. Realizing that the items are worth far more than the $5 he is offering, the boys persuade Mrs. Prince to refuse the deal; angered, he retaliates by banning them from the store for life.

Bart and Milhouse later try to sneak into the store to see an appearance by special effects artist Tom Savini, but are discovered and turned away. Savini plays a series of tricks to embarrass Comic Book Guy, causing him to become so angry from the audience&#x27;s mockery that he attempts to ban them all for life. Before he can throw them out of the store, though, he suffers a heart attack.

At the hospital, Dr. Hibbert urges Comic Book Guy to leave the store in someone else&#x27;s care while he recovers; with no one else to turn to, he reluctantly puts Bart and Milhouse in charge. The store prospers at first under the boys&#x27; management, but business falters when Milhouse places an order for 2,000 copies of an extremely unpopular comic without telling Bart. As the boys argue, they stumble across Comic Book Guy&#x27;s secret collection of illegal videos, such as a drunk Fred Rogers, police interview footage of Ned Flanders reporting Homer for letting a radioactive ape loose in his house, and a top secret film detailing a plan by the U.S. military to let Springfield be destroyed in the event of nuclear war. They decide to hold a midnight screening in the store&#x27;s back room for the children of Springfield.

Meanwhile, Homer helps a recovering Comic Book Guy look for a friend, but his attempts fail until he meets Agnes Skinner. Comic Book Guy and Agnes become romantically involved, discovering their shared contempt for everyone and everything around them, and begin a sexual relationship. When the police raid the store, Milhouse explains that he and Bart do not own the videos. The police then raid Comic Book Guy&#x27;s home and arrest him while he and Agnes are making love, and Agnes breaks off the relationship, saying that she is too old to wait for him to be released from jail. With the store now closed by the police, Bart and Milhouse reconcile and return to their normal lives as Ned tries to cope with the ape Homer let loose.

==Production==
&quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 4, 2001. The episode was originally called &quot;The Fiver&quot;, a reference to a scene that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;, a title that amused the staff. According to Doyle, &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series&#x27; staff—particularly, Hank Azaria, who voices the character—found it hard to make the character seem likable. &quot;Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically&quot;, Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. &quot;It was hard to find a way to sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes.&quot; Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, &quot;It&#x27;s tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more.&quot;

In a scene in the episode, Ralph is seen entering the adult section of The Android&#x27;s Dungeon. When he is off-screen, Ralph can be heard saying &quot;Everybody&#x27;s hugging&quot;. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Azaria stated that the line is one of his favorite jokes in the series. Originally, Ralph&#x27;s line would be &quot;She&#x27;s hungry&quot;, but it was eventually removed from the episode.

The episode features American special effects-makeup artist and actor Tom Savini as himself. Savini accepted the role because he is friends with Dana Gould, a former staff writer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Doyle said that Savini was &quot;really fun&quot; when he visited to record his lines. In a scene in the episode, a crow is seen tearing apart an issue of &quot;Biclops&quot;. The voice of the crow was recorded from a real crow, even though the staff usually use main cast members Dan Castellaneta and Nancy Cartwright to imitate animal noises. The general officer in the government film called &quot;Secret Nuclear Defense Plan&quot; was voiced by Azaria.

==Cultural references==
To demonstrate the durability of Radioactive Man #1000, Comic Book Guy pours soda on it, which bounces off and instead damages a batch of &quot;lesser&quot; comics. On top of the batch is an issue of &quot;Bongo Comics&quot;, a comic book written by Matt Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The comedian Gallagher is shown doing his routine with a watermelon during a flashback. While in The Android&#x27;s Dungeon, Nelson examines a comic book called &quot;The Death of Sad Sack&quot;, a reference to the American comic strip &quot;Sad Sack&quot; and to the &quot;Death of Superman&quot; story arc. When Homer and Comic Book Guy enter Moe&#x27;s Tavern, Moe says, &quot;Get out and take your Sacagawea dollars with you&quot; to one of his customers. A Sacagawea dollar is a United States dollar coin that has been minted since 2000. After he is thrown out of Moe&#x27;s Tavern, Comic Book Guy says the word &quot;loneliness&quot; in Klingon, a language used by the fictional Klingons in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. While arguing with Agnes, Comic Book Guy says &quot;Now I know what ever happened to Baby Jane.&quot; The line is a reference to the 1960 suspense novel &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;. Martin&#x27;s mother tries to sell Comic Book Guy several items relating to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, including Carrie Fisher&#x27;s &quot;anti-jiggle breast tape&quot;, George Lucas&#x27; handwritten original script of &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; and a film of a supposed alternate ending for the series where it is revealed that &quot;Luke&#x27;s father is Chewbacca.&quot; While fighting Milhouse, Bart picks up a robotic toy, which unfolds into an axe. Milhouse picks up a similar toy, but it instead unfolds into a watering can. The toys are based on the franchise Transformers. One of the tapes that Bart and Milhouse watch shows Fred Rogers intoxicated. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean later met Rogers&#x27; wife at a hall of fame, and said that he was &quot;really embarrassed&quot; when he found out that she had seen the episode.

==Reception==

In its original American broadcast on February 4, 2001, &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; received a 9.8 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to about 10 million viewers. The episode finished in 27th place in the ratings for the week of January 29 – February 4, 2001. Later that year, Azaria won the 53rd Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role as Comic Book Guy in the episode. When participating in the ceremony, the actors are only allowed to submit one episode each, and that year, Azaria said that &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; was an &quot;obvious&quot; choice for him. It was not the first time Azaria won the award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance; in 1998, he won it for his portrayal of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon in the series.

On August 18, 2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season&quot;. Mike Scully, Al Jean, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Matt Selman, Hank Azaria, Larry Doyle and Chris Kirkpatrick participated in the audio commentary for the episode.

Following its broadcast, &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics.

Casey Burchby of DVD Talk enjoyed the episode and wrote that it has some &quot;great stuff&quot; in it, including the comic book &quot;Biclops&quot; that Milhouse over-orders.

Jason Bailey, another reviewer for DVD talk, applauded the writers for making an episode around a supporting character, and wrote that it is &quot;far from [the series&#x27; worst episode]&quot;.

Cindy White of IGN described the episode as a &quot;classic&quot;, and in 2006, Kimberley Potts of AOL put the episode in twelfth place in a list of the series&#x27; 20 best episodes.

The episode was also well received by the series&#x27; staff; in the introduction of &quot;The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued&quot;, Matt Groening wrote that he particularly enjoyed the episode and that it had a &quot;very special story&quot;. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Doyle said that Milhouse&#x27;s line &quot;I&#x27;m a human boy, just like you&quot; is the best line he has ever written.

However, Mac MacEntire of DVD Verdict gave the episode a mixed review. Although he praised the episode&#x27;s premise, he argued that the episode was &quot;ill-balanced&quot; and that the subplot took up too much time in the episode.

DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson criticized the writers for making an episode based around a supporting character, and argued that Comic Book Guy was not featured enough in the episode. &quot;&#x27;Ever&#x27; spends at least as much time with Bart and Milhouse as it does with CBG and Agnes&quot;, he wrote. He concluded that, aside from having a few &quot;good moments&quot;, the episode is overall &quot;pretty meh&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Bladensburg, also known as the Bladensburg Races, took place during the Chesapeake Campaign, part of the War of 1812, on 24 August 1814, at Bladensburg, Maryland, northeast of Washington, D.C.

The battle has been described as &quot;the greatest disgrace ever dealt to American arms,&quot; a British force of army regulars and Royal Marines routed a combined U.S. force of Regular Army and state militia troops. The American defeat resulted in the capture and burning of the national capital of Washington, D.C., the only time that the city fell to a foreign invader.

==Background==
===British plans===

For the first two years of the War of 1812 (1812–1815), the British had been preoccupied with the war against Napoleon and his French Empire (France) in Europe. However, warships of the Royal Navy led by Rear Admiral George Cockburn, second in command of the North American Station, controlled Chesapeake Bay from early 1813 onwards and had captured large numbers of U.S. trading vessels. They occupied Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia, establishing Fort Albion as an anchorage and staging area. As many as 1,200 British soldiers would be stationed there.

Raiding parties had destroyed foundries and batteries and sacked several small towns, but lack of troops restricted Cockburn to mounting small-scale raids, the largest of which was the Battle of Craney Island, in the Hampton Roads harbor near Norfolk, Virginia, which involved 2,000 men of the British Army and the Royal Marines. Although Cockburn withdrew from Chesapeake Bay late in 1813, his sailors had taken soundings and even placed buoys to mark channels and sandbars, in preparation for a renewed campaign in 1814.

By April 1814, Napoleon had been defeated and was exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Italy, and large numbers of British ships and troops were now free to be used to prosecute the former backwater war with the United States. As part of the measures taken to prosecute the war more vigorously, Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren was replaced as commander in chief of the North American Station by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, who was a more active and experienced officer who often expressed his rancour with the United States.

Most of the newly available troops went to the continental colonies of British North America where Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost (who was &quot;Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty’s Forces in the said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, and in the islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton and the Bermudas, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot;&#x27;) was preparing to lead an invasion into New York from the Canadas, heading for Lake Champlain and the upper Hudson River. However, the Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched a brigade of 2,500 soldiers, mainly veterans from the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army, and commanded by Major General Robert Ross, to the Imperial fortress of Bermuda, from where a blockade of the U.S. coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. Ross&#x27; brigade arrived there aboard , three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. The intention was for this force to carry out raids on the Atlantic Seaboard to &quot;effect a diversion on the coasts of the United States of America in favor of the army employed in the defence of Upper and Lower Canada&quot;.

===United States plans and preparations===

Meanwhile, Albert Gallatin, President James Madison&#x27;s nominated commissioner for negotiations with the British government, sent news from Europe of Napoleon&#x27;s abdication and the apparent hardening of British attitudes towards the United States.

On 1 July 1814, Madison summoned his cabinet to discuss the increased threat to the United States&#x27; Atlantic coast, including Washington, although the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, insisted that the British would not attack Washington, since it was strategically unimportant. He felt the most likely target would be the city of Baltimore, which offered more commercial targets and plunder than Washington. Armstrong was half right; the British would launch attacks against both Baltimore and Washington.

Nevertheless, on 2 July, Madison designated the area around Washington and Baltimore as the United States Army&#x27;s Tenth Military District and, without consulting Armstrong, appointed Brigadier General William H. Winder as its commander. Winder was the nephew of Levin Winder, Federalist Governor of Maryland. He had practiced law in Baltimore before being commissioned as a colonel in 1812 and had only recently been exchanged after having been captured at the Battle of Stoney Creek in July 1813.

On 5 July, he and Armstrong conferred. Winder suggested calling up some militia in advance of any attack, but Armstrong insisted that militia could best be used on the spur of the moment. Winder spent a month visiting the forts and settlements in his new command. Armstrong did not provide him with any staff, and despite his fears that the British could launch an attack against almost any point with very little warning, Winder did not order any field fortifications to be constructed, nor make any other preparations.

==Campaign==
===British moves===

Although Major General Ross commanded the British troops in Chesapeake Bay, the point of attack was to be decided by Vice Admiral Cochrane, who had concentrated four ships of the line, twenty frigates and sloops of war and twenty transports carrying Ross&#x27;s troops at Tangier Island. Rear Admiral Cockburn, Cochrane&#x27;s second in command, favoured a quick attack on Washington, but Ross was not eager. His men had been confined aboard their transports for nearly three months, and he lacked cavalry, artillery, and transport. Ross was also wary of the U.S. Chesapeake Bay Flotilla (three gunboats and ten gun-armed barges) lurking in the Patuxent River. His first objective had to be the capture or destruction of the U.S. flotilla.

Cochrane dispatched two forces to make diversions. The frigate HMS &quot;Menelaus&quot; and some small craft threatened a raid on Baltimore, while two frigates and some bomb ketches and a rocket vessel ascended the Potomac River, an expedition that resulted in the successful Raid on Alexandria. His main body proceeded into the Patuxent. Ross&#x27;s troops landed at Benedict on 19 August, and began marching upstream the following day, while Cockburn proceeded up the river with ships&#x27; boats and small craft. By 21 August, Ross had reached Nottingham, and Commodore Joshua Barney was forced to destroy the gunboats and other sailing craft of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla the next day, and retreat overland towards Washington.

From Nottingham, Ross continued up the Patuxent to Upper Marlboro, from where he could threaten to advance on either Washington or Baltimore, confusing the Americans. He might have taken the capital almost unopposed had he advanced on August 23, but instead he rested his men and organised his force. On the night of 23–24 August, at the urging of Rear Admiral Cockburn and some of the British Army officers under his own command, Ross decided to risk an attack on Washington. He had four infantry battalions, a battalion of Royal Marines, a force of about 200 men of the Corps of Colonial Marines, which was composed of locally recruited black refugees from slavery, a Congreve rocket detachment from the Royal Marines battalion, 50 Royal Sappers and Miners, 100 gunners from the Navy and 275 sailors to carry supplies. His force totaled 4,370 men, with one 6-pounder gun, two 3-pounder guns and sixty launchers, each being attached to a rocket. Rear Admiral Cockburn accompanied this force.

Ross had a choice of two routes by which he could advance: from the south via Woodyard or from the east via Bladensburg. The former route would involve finding a way across an unfordable part of the Eastern Branch of the Potomac (now called the Anacostia River) if the U.S. destroyed the bridge on the route. In the morning of 24 August, Ross made a feint on the southern route, before suddenly swerving northwards towards Bladensburg.

===U.S. moves===
In Washington, Brigadier General Winder could call in theory upon 15,000 militia, but he actually had only 120 dragoons and 300 other regulars, plus 1,500 poorly trained and under-equipped militiamen at his immediate disposal. On 20 August, Winder ordered this force to advance south towards Long Old Fields and Woodyard (off modern Route 5) to confront the British forces at Upper Marlboro. After a brief clash with Ross&#x27;s leading units on 22 August, Winder ordered a hasty retreat to the Long Old Fields. He feared that the British might make a surprise night attack, in which the British would hold the advantage in organisation and discipline while Winder&#x27;s own advantage in artillery would count for little. Winder had been captured in just such a night attack at Stoney Creek the year before.

Although he rode with the forces directly challenging the British invaders, Winder realized that Bladensburg was the key to Washington&#x27;s defence. Bladensburg commanded the roads to Baltimore and Annapolis, along which reinforcements were moving to join him. The town also lay on one of the only two routes available for the British to advance on Washington, in fact the preferred route because the Eastern Branch was easy to ford there. On 20 August, Winder had ordered Brigadier General Tobias Stansbury to move from Baltimore to Bladensburg, &quot;take the best position in advance of Bladensburg ... and should he be attacked, to resist as long as possible&quot;.

On 22 August, Stansbury deployed his force on Lowndes Hill, where he hastily dug earthworks for artillery emplacements. The road from Annapolis crossed the hill, and the road from Upper Marlboro ran to its south and west. Furthermore, the roads to Washington, Georgetown, and Baltimore all intersected between it and Bladensburg. From this position, Stansbury dominated the approaches available to the British while controlling the lines of communication.

At 2:30 a.m. on August 23, Stansbury received a message from Winder, informing him that he had withdrawn across the Eastern Branch and he intended to fire the lower bridge. Surprised, Stansbury was seized by an irrational fear that his right flank could be turned. Instead of strengthening his commanding position, he immediately decamped and marched his exhausted troops across Bladensburg bridge, which he did not burn, to a brickyard further on. He had thus thrown away almost every tactical advantage available to him.

Meanwhile, in Washington, every government department was hastily packing its records and evacuating them to Maryland or Virginia, in requisitioned or hired carts or river boats.

==Battle==

===U.S. dispositions===

Winder now had at least 1,000 regulars from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps, plus about 7,000 less than dependable militia and volunteers from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. Official reports of his strength range from 5,000 to 9,000 men. Winder&#x27;s report to the Secretary of War stated that he was able &quot;By the most active and harassing movement of the troops to interpose before the enemy at Bladensburg about 5,000.&quot; Ross, the British commander, estimated the American force at between 8,000 and 9,000 men, with 300–400 cavalry. From other contemporary sources, the forces available for the defense of Washington probably numbered about 7,170, of which 6,370 were at Bladensburg.

Stansbury&#x27;s force consisted of the 1st (Ragan&#x27;s), 2nd (Schutz&#x27;s), and 5th (Sterrett&#x27;s) regiments of Maryland Militia, three companies of volunteer riflemen commanded by Major William Pinkney (a former United States Attorney General), and two companies of Baltimore artillery, with six 6-pounder guns. Ragan&#x27;s and Schutz&#x27;s regiments were hastily organised amalgamations of companies, all without uniforms. Sterrett&#x27;s 5th Maryland Regiment was a &quot;Dandy&quot; regiment of uniformed volunteers.

Stansbury chose a defensible position, though hardly the best one available, on the west side of the Eastern Branch of the Potomac opposite the town of Bladensburg. The artillery was posted in an earthwork hastily constructed by Colonel Decius Wadsworth, the Army&#x27;s Commissary General of Ordnance, to the north of the bridge. The earthwork had been designed for heavier weapons, and the 6-pounder field guns had a restricted field of fire through its embrasures. They could not use oblique fire to prevent the bridge from being seized. The Maryland militia infantry regiments were posted in a line of battle south of the earthwork, too far away to protect the artillery and exposed to British fire. Both Winder and Secretary of State James Monroe later tinkered with Stansbury&#x27;s dispositions. Monroe moved companies and detachments without correcting the major faults in Stansbury&#x27;s position, while Winder moved the three militia regiments into even more exposed positions behind the Baltimore artillery&#x27;s redoubt, though Monroe reinforced them with a militia artillery company under Captain Benjamin Burch. Monroe also ordered the 120 U.S. Dragoons under Colonel Jacint Lavall to occupy a ravine behind Stansbury&#x27;s infantry, but left them without further orders or information.

Behind Stansbury&#x27;s troops and to his right was a brigade of District of Columbia militia under Brigadier General Walter Smith, which had marched from Long Old Fields. Smith&#x27;s brigade was strongly posted behind a creek and along the crest of some rising ground, but Smith had not conferred with Stansbury before deploying his brigade, and there was a gap of a mile between them. Smith&#x27;s men would be unable to support Stansbury, and if Stansbury were overcome, Smith&#x27;s left flank would be open to attack. A battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kramer lined the creek. Joshua Barney&#x27;s men, with two 18-pounder guns and three 12-pounder guns drawn from the Washington Navy Yard, were posted astride the Washington turnpike. (Barney had originally been posted to guard the lower bridge over the Eastern Branch and destroy it if necessary, but he had pleaded to President Madison and the Secretary of the Navy that he and his men were needed where the action was.) To Barney&#x27;s left was the 1st Regiment of &quot;District&quot; Militia, a militia artillery company under Major George Peter with six 6-pounder guns and a provisional battalion of regulars under Lieutenant Colonel William Scott. The 2nd District Militia were posted behind Peter and Scott.

To Smith&#x27;s right rear in turn was a column of Maryland militia under Colonel William Beall, which had just arrived from Annapolis. A regiment of Virginia Militia under Colonel George Minor was delayed by administrative confusion and arrived on the field only as the battle ended. (Minor&#x27;s men had arrived in Washington without arms or ammunition. When Minor prevailed on Winder to order muskets to be distributed on the morning of the battle, the junior officer responsible for issuing their flints insisted that they be returned and recounted.)

Stansbury&#x27;s troops were tired from two days&#x27; constant alarms and redeployments, and Smith&#x27;s and Beall&#x27;s men were equally exhausted from having force-marched to the battlefield through a hot and humid summer day, with many diversions and unnecessary panics.

===Action===

Around noon on 24 August, Ross&#x27;s army reached Bladensburg. Stansbury&#x27;s tactical errors quickly became apparent. Had he held Lowndes Hill, Stansbury could have made the British approach a costly one (although this would have involved fighting with the East Branch at his back, which would not have improved his men&#x27;s morale and might have been disastrous in a hasty retreat). Had he held the brick structures of Bladensburg, which were ready-made mini-fortresses, he might have embroiled Ross&#x27;s troops in bloody street fighting. Because the bridge had not been burned, it had to be defended. Stansbury&#x27;s infantry and artillery were posted too far from the river&#x27;s edge to contest a crossing effectively.

The British advance was led by Colonel William Thornton&#x27;s 85th Light Infantry and the three light companies of the other line battalions along with perhaps 100 African-American Colonial Marines. The Baltimore artillery and Pinkney&#x27;s riflemen stopped Thornton&#x27;s first rush across the bridge. Major Harry Smith, Ross&#x27;s Brigade major, considered that Ross and Thornton had attacked too hastily, without waiting for other units to support Thornton, or sending forward skirmishers across the fords to cover the advance. However, Thornton&#x27;s men eventually established themselves on the south bank of the river, and began advancing in loose order. The Baltimore artillery had solid shot only, which was of little use against scattered skirmishers. Pinkney, whose elbow was shattered by a musket ball, was driven back and as Thornton&#x27;s men closed in, the Baltimore artillerymen retreated with five of their cannon, being forced to spike and abandon another.

The British 1/44th Regiment had meanwhile forded the East Branch above the bridge. As they prepared to envelop the American left, Winder led a counter-attack against Thornton by Sterrett&#x27;s 5th Maryland militia, joined by other detachments. As the 5th Maryland exchanged fire with British infantry in cover on three sides, Schutz&#x27;s and Ragan&#x27;s conscripted militia broke and fled under a barrage of rockets. Winder issued confused orders for three of Captain Burch&#x27;s guns to fall back rather than cover Sterrett&#x27;s retreat, and the 5th Maryland and the rest of Stansbury&#x27;s brigade fled the field, sweeping most of Lavall&#x27;s horsemen with them.

The British pressed on and were engaged by Smith&#x27;s brigade and Barney&#x27;s and Peters&#x27;s guns. Thornton&#x27;s light brigade made several frontal attacks over the creek, but were repulsed three times by artillery fire, and were counter-attacked by Barney&#x27;s detachment. Thornton was badly wounded and his light infantry were driven back with heavy casualties. However, as the 1/44th threatened Smith&#x27;s open left flank, Winder ordered Smith to retreat also.

Smith&#x27;s brigade fell back initially in good order, but Winder&#x27;s orders to retreat apparently did not reach Barney, and his situation worsened when the civilian drivers of the carts carrying his reserve ammunition joined the general rout, leaving the Marine gun crews with fewer than three rounds of canister, round shot and charges in their caissons. Barney&#x27;s 300 sailors and 103 Marines nevertheless held off the British frontal attacks, launching counter-attacks armed with hand pikes and cutlasses, with cries of &quot;Board&#x27;em! Board&#x27;em!&quot;. Eventually, as the British 1/4th and 1/44th Regiments enveloped their left flank, Barney ordered his men to retreat to avoid capture. Barney himself was badly wounded in the thigh with a musket ball and was taken prisoner. The British later congratulated Barney for his bravery and released him.

Beall&#x27;s troops were also driven from the hill they held, after an ineffectual resistance.

Winder had not given any instructions before the battle in the case of a retreat and as the American militia left the battlefield, he issued contradictory orders to halt and reform, or fall back on the Capitol where Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. hoped vainly to make a stand, using the federal buildings as strongpoints, or retreat through Georgetown to Tenleytown. Most of the militia simply fled the field with no destination in mind, or deserted the ranks to see to the safety of their families.

The efforts of British commander Robert Ross during the battle deserve praise, according to journalist Steve Vogel, in his book about that era. &quot;He conducted a brilliant campaign of deception, feinting one way or the other, marching and then doubling back, and was able to paralyze the Americans and prevent them from defending Bladensburg&quot;.

==Casualties==
Although the British had suffered heavier casualties than the U.S. (many inflicted by Barney&#x27;s guns), they had completely routed the defenders. British casualties were 64 dead and 185 wounded. Some of the British dead &quot;died without sustaining a scratch. They collapsed from heat exhaustion and the strain of punishing forced marches over the five days since landing at Benedict&quot;. Heidler&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of the War of 1812&quot; gives the U.S. loss as &quot;10 or 12 killed, 40 wounded&quot; and &quot;about 100&quot; captured. Henry Adams and John S. Williams both give the American casualties as 26 killed and 51 wounded.

Joseph A. Whitehorne says the Americans lost &quot;120 taken prisoner, many of these wounded&quot;. Ten cannon and two colors, belonging to the 1st Harford Light Dragoons {Maryland} and the James City Light Infantry {VA}, were captured by the British.

For many of the U.S. wounded, Naval Hospital Washington was the primary treatment center. Thirty-three incoming patients recorded in August and September 1814 were American seamen, soldiers, and marines wounded from Bladensburg or subsequent engagements. One British soldier, Jeremiah McCarthy is also recorded. The majority of those wounded however, were first treated on the field of battle and often by British surgeons. Despite the war, both sides generally respected hospitals and afforded care to the enemy wounded. The naval hospital&#x27;s 1814 register reflects U.S. seamen Frederick Ernest and George Gallagher both endured amputations in the field.

==Aftermath==

The hasty and disorganized U.S. retreat led to the battle becoming known as the &quot;Bladensburg Races&quot; from an 1816 poem. The battle was termed &quot;the greatest disgrace ever dealt to American arms&quot; and &quot;the most humiliating episode in American history&quot;. The American militia actually fled through the streets of Washington. President James Madison and most of the rest of the federal government had been present at the battle, and had nearly been captured. They, too, fled the capital, and scattered through Maryland and Virginia. That same night the British entered Washington unopposed and set fire to many of the government buildings in what became known as the Burning of Washington.

Lieutenant General Prevost had urged Vice Admiral Cochrane to avenge the raid on Port Dover on the north shore of Lake Erie earlier in the year, in which the undefended settlement had been set ablaze by American troops. Cochrane issued a proclamation that American property was forfeit; only the lives of the civilian inhabitants were to be spared. He had issued a private memorandum to his captains however, which allowed them to levy what was effectively protection money in return for sparing buildings. In fact, there was little or no looting or wanton destruction of private property by Ross&#x27;s troops or Cochrane&#x27;s sailors during the advance and the occupation of Washington. However, when the British later withdrew to their ships in the Patuxent, discipline was less effective (partly because of fatigue) and there was considerable looting by foraging parties and by stragglers and deserters.

After Major General Ross was killed at the Battle of North Point on 12 September 1814, his descendants were given an augmentation of honor to their armorial bearings by a royal warrant dated August 25, 1815, and their family name was changed to the victory title &quot;Ross-of-Bladensburg&quot; in memory of Ross&#x27;s most famous battle.

The lineages of the 5th Maryland Regiment and the Columbian Division are perpetuated by the present-day 175th Infantry (ARNG MD) and the HHD/372nd Military Police Battalion (ARNG DC), two of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. The lineages of the old 36th and 38th Infantry Regiments are perpetuated by three currently active battalions of the 4th Infantry (1–4 Inf, 2–4 Inf and 3–4 Inf).

In the British Army, the battle honor &quot;Bladensburg&quot; was awarded to the 4th, 21st, 44th and 85th Regiments of Foot. The successor units within the British Army are, respectively: The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (via the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Scotland (via the Royal Highland Fusiliers), the Royal Anglian Regiment (via the Essex Regiment), and the Rifles (via the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry).

==African Americans==

Black sailors fought as part of the U.S. force at Bladensburg, many as members of Commodore Joshua Barney&#x27;s naval flotilla. This force provided crucial artillery support during the battle. One of the best accounts is that of Charles Ball, born 1785. Ball served with Commodore Barney at Bladensburg and later helped man the defenses at Baltimore. In his 1837 memoir, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: &quot;I stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down... if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, could have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs.&quot; “Anecdotal accounts from the time period suggest that anywhere from 15 to 50 percent of any given U.S. naval vessel’s crew were of African descent”
The exact number of black sailors in the War of 1812 is difficult for historians to determine, since &quot;navy muster rolls rarely mention race or ethnicity.&quot; Modern scholars estimate that black soldiers made up 15% to 20% of U.S. naval forces in the War of 1812.

Just before the battle, Commodore Barney, on being asked by Madison &quot;if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British?&quot; replied: &quot;No, Sir... they don&#x27;t know how to run; they will die by their guns first.&quot; The Commodore was correct, as the men did not run; one such man was young sailor Harry Jones (No. 35), apparently a free black man. Jones was wounded in the final action at Bladensburg and remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington, D.C., for nearly two months.

Black troops also fought on the British side with the Corps of Colonial Marines in the attacks on Bladensburg and Washington, D.C. Vice Admiral Cochrane reformed the corps, which had been disbanded in 1810, in 1814, deliberately recruiting enslaved black Americans with a promise of freedom for themselves and their families. The corps received the same training, uniforms, pay, and pensions as their Royal Marine counterparts. Following the Treaty of Ghent, the British kept their promise and in 1815 evacuated the Colonial Marines and their families to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Bermuda.

==Battlefield preservation==

Like many historic battlefields that once belonged to the rural American landscape, urban sprawl and heavily-traveled roads associated with urbanization in the DC metro area have made it very difficult to preserve and acquire the complete site of the Bladensburg battleground. However, the City of Bladensburg, in association with Prince George&#x27;s County and the State of Maryland, has set up a number of historical markers in various places of importance on the battlefield and offers a walking tour, with a free audio &quot;tour guide&quot; to help one explore the battlefield itself. Prince George&#x27;s County had also established a museum for the battle at the Bladensburg Waterfront Park, but the museum is indefinitely closed.

Anita Yuen Wing Yee (born 4 September 1971) is a Hong Kong actress and beauty pageant titleholder.

==Pageant career==
At the age of 18, Yuen entered the Miss Hong Kong 1990 pageant. She was a heavy favorite to win the crown from the semifinal to final. During the semifinals on August 5, 1990, she won the Miss Photogenic award. She had a semifinal score of 485, placing 3rd overall. The finals were held on August 21, 1990. She eventually beat out another big favorite, Helen Yung who was 1st runner up and the winner of 2 other awards. Yuen later represented Hong Kong at the Miss Chinese International 1991 pageant, held on February 2, 1991. She took 1st runner up for Hong Kong. She also competed at the Miss Universe 1991 pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada. She failed to make the top 10 and was placed 60th.

==Film career==
Yuen is best known for her role as the female lead in Derek Yee&#x27;s 1993 tear-jerker &quot;C&#x27;est la vie, mon chéri&quot; (1993). She is also well-remembered in her cross-gender comic role opposite Leslie Cheung in &quot;He&#x27;s a Woman, She&#x27;s a Man&quot; (1994). The two roles won for her the Hong Kong Academy Best Actress awards. She also gave a powerful performance in, for instance, &quot;The Chinese Feast&quot;, co-starring together with Leslie Cheung. Apart from her role in a great many films, she has also acted in a number of Mainland-Taiwan television serials, such as Hua Mu Lan, opposite Vincent Zhao.

==Personal life==
Her husband is Hong Kong actor and singer Julian Cheung. In May 2006, Yuen announced that she was 3 months pregnant with their first child. Their son, Morton Cheung, was born on November 12, 2006. On June 23, 2007, Yuen was a guest on TVB&#x27;s &quot;Be My Guest&quot; with host Stephen Chan revealing that she and Julian were secretly married in Shibuya City, Japan, back in 2001. Anita had finally revealed in early 2021 that after she gave birth to Morton, she and her husband Julian attempted to have a second child first through natural conception with desire for their son Morton to have a little brother or sister, however this attempt failed as Anita&#x27;s natural increasing age was an antithetical factor. Anita and Julian then agreed to try In vitro fertilisation using sperm extracted from Julian&#x27;s collected preserved semen to impregnate Anita, but after multiple procedural attempts, the attempted pregnancy was unsuccessful and they eventually gave up on the attempt.

<doc id="1335367" wikidata="Q766099" url="?curid=1335367" title="Wakanda">
<text>Wakanda (), officially the Kingdom of Wakanda, is a fictional country appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the country first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #52 (July 1966). Wakanda is located in sub-Saharan Africa and has been depicted as being in East Africa. It is home to the superhero Black Panther.

Wakanda has appeared in comics and various media adaptations, such as in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where it is depicted as the most technologically advanced nation on Earth.

==Location==
Some sources place Wakanda just north of Tanzania and exactly at Rwanda, while others such as &quot;Marvel Atlas&quot; #2 show it at the north end of Lake Turkana, in between South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia (and surrounded by fictional countries like Azania, Canaan, and Narobia).

Director Ryan Coogler stated that his depiction of Wakanda in the 2018 film &quot;Black Panther&quot; was inspired by the Southern African Kingdom of Lesotho.

In recent stories by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, Wakanda is located on Lake Victoria, near fellow fictional nations Mohannda, Canaan, Azania, and Niganda. This places these nations mostly in what in real life is the eastern half of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Birnin Zana is located within Wakanda. It is considered by some to be a smart city. In Birnin Zana, pedestrians walk along commerce-filled streets that are car-free except for the occasional appearance of bus-like shuttles. The whole is quite similar to the woonerf concept, an approach to public space design which started in the Netherlands in the 1970s. Maglev trains are seen zipping above and around the city. Wakandan buildings incorporate some traditional African elements, such as thatched roofs and hanging gardens, on some of the tallest structures.

==History==

Before the emergence of the Wakandan nation, mystic beings known as Originators lived in the region. Originators were diverse races: Anansi (spider-like), Vanyan (ape-like), Creeping Doom (insectoid), Ibeji (two-headed humanoids) and Children of Olokun (sea-creatures).

The Originators were expelled from the region by the humans and the Orisha, the pantheon of Wakanda consisting of Thoth, Ptah, Mujaji, Kokou and Bast, the Panther Goddess.

Eons ago during the First Blasphemy, Khonshu tries to avenge a prisoner that was killed by Varnae only for Bast to tell Khonshu to stay his hand. Varnae who stole Vibranium from the Fires of Ptah and planned to ascend to godhood. This attracted the attention of Khonshu who met with Bast, Eshu, Gherke, and Ptah during Ra&#x27;s slumber. He wants the gods in the surrounding realms to be made aware before he retaliates. He gets their support alongside the support of Kokou the Ever-Burning. In the distant past, Bast and Gherke lead the Enneads and the Orishas against Varnae&#x27;s forces. Kokou confronts Varnae in his temple. The prisoners are evacuated as Bast instructs the black panthers to take the prisoners west and wait for the news of victory.

In the distant past, a massive meteorite made up of the element vibranium crashed in Wakanda. The meteorite was named Mena Ngai. It was unearthed a generation before the events of the present day. T&#x27;Challa, the previous Black Panther and brother to the current Black Panther, Shuri, is the son of T&#x27;Chaka, the Black Panther before him and a descendant of Olumo Bashenga. Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T&#x27;Chaka conceals his country from the outside world. He sells off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country&#x27;s best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world&#x27;s most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer Ulysses Klaue finds his way to Wakanda and covers up his work on a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaue kills T&#x27;Chaka, only to see his &quot;sound blaster&quot; turned on him by a grieving teenaged T&#x27;Challa. Klaue&#x27;s right hand is destroyed, and he and his men flee.

Wakanda has an unusually high rate of mutation due to the dangerously mutagenic properties of the Vibranium Mound. A large number of these Wakandan Mutates are working for Erik Killmonger.

Vibranium radiation has permeated much of Wakanda&#x27;s flora and fauna, including the Heart-Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Tribe (although T&#x27;Challa once allowed a dying Spider-Man to eat it in the hope that it would help him deal with a mysterious illness) and the flesh of the White Gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Tribe.

In the 2008 &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Skrull forces led by Commander K&#x27;vvvr invade Wakanda and engage Black Panther and his forces. Due to heavy resistance to the deployment of technological developments, both sides are forced to fight with swords and spears. The Wakandan forces voluntarily wear panther masks; this prevents the Skrulls from focusing attacks on their leader. Despite losses, the Wakandans defeat the Skrulls. They kill every single one, including K&#x27;vvvr, and send their ship back, packed with the bodies. A warning against invading Wakanda is left written on the wall of the ship&#x27;s control center.

While under the cosmic power of the Phoenix Force, Namor attacks Wakanda for hiding the Avengers and destroys much of the country with a tidal wave. After the attack, all mutants (particularly those who were siding with Phoenix controlled mutants) are banned from entering Wakanda as stated by Black Panther. Some students from the Jean Grey school are attacked by the Wakandan people; the students barely flee with the help of Storm.

When Hydra manipulates a sentient cosmic cube named Kobik into unknowingly replacing the real Captain America&#x27;s Steve Roger with his Hydra counterpart, then enact their Secret Empire, Wakanda is under a threat to be taken over by the rise of terrorist group across the universe, with its king T&#x27;Challa getting captured and forced to surrender, until all heroes and some villains who rebel against Hydra finally find a way to get both Kobik and the real Steve Rogers back, while rescuing both T&#x27;Challa and the rest of both captured and manipulated heroes. Once Hydra&#x27;s empire has been undone, Wakanda expanded its legacy to form an intergalactic empire on Planet Bast, while also revoking the mutant ban in their country, such as allowing Storm to visit and help anytime. The empire, now encompassing five galaxies, arises after a mission that sought the origin of Mena Ngai, the meteorite that brought the vibranium to Wakanda.

In an alternative timeline set 2000 years in the distant past, a man named after Killmonger&#x27;s real name, N&#x27;Jadaka, became a hero of the empire after retrieving the Shard of M&#x27;Kraan during the war against the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. However, the current ruler of Wakanda feared that N&#x27;Jadaka would overthrow him, so he sent N&#x27;Jadaka along with his squad on a secret suicide mission to take the Matrix of the Mamadou galaxy, which was inhabited by the Kronans, Shadow People, and the Klyntar. Upon arriving on a planet in the galaxy, they were quickly attacked by a race known as the Between. Trying to survive, he came across a member of the Klyntar race and bonded with it, since they had a mutual hatred against the current emperor, who made the Klyntar an endangered species. Upon defeating the Between, N&#x27;Jadaka and the symbiote killed the emperor and took the throne as the new emperor of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. During this time, he got married and conceived a daughter. Upon finding out that T&#x27;Challa from the future had arrived in his present, he feared that T&#x27;Challa would join the Maroon rebels, so he had him become a member of the Nameless, slaves who had their memories wiped and were forced to mine for Vibranium on asteroids. However, T&#x27;Challa retained his memories of Storm and managed to escape to join the Maroon&#x27;s regardless. After that, N&#x27;Jadaka approached Bast and after recounting his origin, battled Bast&#x27;s avatar. He was successful in killing it and making his daughter the new Avatar of Bast. After the Maroons got ahold of N&#x27;Jadaka&#x27;s daughter and T&#x27;Challa had visited the planet of the Between, N&#x27;Jadaka with his army went after the rebels in order to get his daughter back. However, Bast betrayed him and made his Empire fighters crash into the mothership while a rebel commander set the planet holding the rebel base&#x27;s core to explode as a last ditch attempt to stop him; resulting in the sacrifice of thousands of lives and the apparent death of N&#x27;Jadaka.

After N&#x27;Jadaka invades Earth, Queen Ramonda forms an alliance with the Originators to prevent total destruction.

==Characterization==
=== Name ===
There are several theories about the etymology of Wakanda. The name may be inspired by a Siouan god called Wakan Tanka&quot;,&quot; Wakanda, Wakonda, or Waconda; or Wakandas. Or it may draw from a fictional African tribe from Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;The Man-Eater&quot;, written in 1915 but published posthumously in 1957; or otherwise from any of several terms derived from the Proto-Bantu &quot;-ganda&quot;, such as the Kenyan Kamba ethnic group, also called Akamba or Wakamba; or the word &quot;kanda&quot;, which means &quot;family&quot; in Kikongo.

=== Language ===
In the comics, Wakanda has three official languages: Wakandan, Yoruba and Hausa. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, characters from Wakanda are portrayed speaking the South African Xhosa language. The Jabari Tribe are portrayed speaking a dialect similar to Igbo from Nigeria.

In the 2018 film &quot;Black Panther&quot; and its 2022 sequel, the Wakandan language is depicted as being written in a Wakandan writing system based on the Nsibidi writing system; the Wakandan writing system was created for the film by production designer Hannah Beachler. According to designer Zach Fannin, it was also inspired by Tifinagh, Ancient South Arabian and Bamum script.

=== Defenses ===
In the comics, Wakanda is the foremost military power on Marvel Earth. The Wakandan Army is the country&#x27;s main ground forces, while the Wakandan Navy oversees naval operations. The Wakandan Air Guard is the nation&#x27;s air force, which includes pilots wearing powerful suits of combat armor. In order to ensure peace and stability in Wakanda, the Black Panther picked Dora Milaje (&quot;adored ones&quot;) from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. The Dora Milaje are trained in various African martial arts such as n&#x27;golo (Angolan), laamb (Senegalese wrestling) and Nguni stick-fighting, as well as other forms of combat from other continents such as krav maga and muay thai. 

Wakanda has its own intelligence system known as the N&#x27;Charu Silema; a spy network that worked across the globe to maintain the nation&#x27;s secrecy. It was considered as good as the Mossad and certainly better than the CIA and MI6. Later, P.R.I.D.E. (Princess Regent Intelligence Division Executives) was developed as the nation&#x27;s protection agency. The nation has a secret police called Hatut Zeraze (War Dogs in the Wakandan language). Wakanda is one of the few Earth-616 civilizations who have contingency plans for dealing with Galactus, &quot;The Devourer of Worlds&quot;.

== Wakandan religion ==
Wakanda contains a number of religious sects originating from various places in Africa, the Pantheon of Wakanda is known as &quot;The Orisha.&quot; Orisha is a Yoruba word meaning spirit or deity. Bast the Panther Goddess, Thoth, god of the moon and wisdom, and Ptah, the Shaper, are Heliopolitan deities, who left ancient Egypt at the time of the pharaohs. Kokou is a warrior orisha from Benin. Mujaji is a rain goddess of the Lobedu people of South Africa. Other deities are worshiped in Wakanda, such as Sekhmet and Sobek, other Helipolitan deities, and the gorilla gods Ghekre and Ngi, worshiped by the Jabari tribe. The mutant Ororo Munroe (aka Storm), ex-wife of T&#x27;Challa and former queen of Wakanda, is called Hadari-Yao (&quot;Walker of Clouds&quot; in ancient Alkamite), a goddess who preserves the balance of natural things. Other little-known gods of Wakanda are enemies of Bast: K&#x27;Liluna, Bast&#x27;s sister, considered a betrayer, and Magba.

===Panther cult===
Bast the Panther Goddess, based on Bast the ancient Egyptian deity, is the primary deity of Wakanda. After the vibranium meteor fell, a number of Wakandans were painfully mutated into &quot;demon spirits&quot; and began attacking their fellow Wakandans.

T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s ancestor Olumo Bashenga began to close the vibranium mound to outsiders. He formed a religious order that guarded the mound and fought to keep the &quot;demon spirits&quot; from spreading across the kingdom. As the ceremonial and religious role, he took the title of Black Panther as chief of the Panther Tribe. As part of the cult&#x27;s ceremonies, a Black Panther is entitled to the use of a heart-shaped herb. The herb enhances the physical attributes of the person who consumes it to near-superhuman levels, in a similar manner to the super-soldier serum.
===White Gorilla cult===
The tribe that would become the Jabari worshiped Ngi, who was responsible for creating Gorilla-Man. Ngi was based on the Yaounde deity of the same name. Currently, the Jabari tribe worship the gorilla god Ghekre, based on the Baoulé deity of the same name. Wakanda evolved from a hunter-warrior society, and was traditionally ruled by its greatest warrior. The dominant Black Panther Cult outlawed the rival White Gorilla Cult&#x27;s worship in Wakanda. M&#x27;Baku (Man-Ape) of the Jabari tribe is one of Wakanda&#x27;s greatest warriors, second only to T&#x27;Challa, the Black Panther himself. While T&#x27;Challa, king of Wakanda, is on a several-month leave of absence from Wakanda, the ambitious M&#x27;Baku plots to usurp the throne. M&#x27;Baku flouts T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s edicts and revives the White Gorilla Cult, killing one of the rare white gorillas living in the jungles near Wakanda. M&#x27;Baku bathes in the gorilla&#x27;s blood and eats its flesh which &quot;mystically&quot; confers the gorilla&#x27;s great strength upon M&#x27;Baku. He tries to defeat T&#x27;Challa in combat, hoping to take over the country, but is beaten and banished from Wakanda. According to the 2018 film, the White Gorilla cult, known in the film as the Jabari (or the Mountain Tribe), revere the (Hindu) monkey god, Hanuman.

===Lion cult===
Sekhmet the Lion Goddess, based on the deity of the same name, could possess the form of any human worshipers or the bodies of those sanctified and sacrificed by her worshipers, she transformed these subjects into human avatars of herself. She has a number of other powers, some of which she has demonstrated. Sekhmet could grow in size, move at rapid speeds, teleport herself and others, and alter her specific density. The Lion goddess possessed superhuman strength and durability, and she was immortal. She can manipulate the minds of the weak-willed.

Little is known of the history of the Lion Goddess. She had apparently lost many worshipers over the years to the Cult of the Panther God, despite the fact that Sekhmet physically manifested before its followers, and the Panther God only appears to its priests.

===Crocodile cult===
Sobek the Crocodile God, based on the deity of the same name, appears to be an ancient and somewhat neglected Wakandan deity.

==Cultural impact and legacy==

=== Accolades ===
* In 2019, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Wakanda 5th in their &quot;10 Most Iconic Superhero Hideouts In Marvel Comics&quot; list.
* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Wakanda 1st in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Fictional Nations In the Marvel Universe&quot; list.
* In 2021, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Wakanda in their &quot;10 Most Important Fictional Marvel Comics Countries&quot; list.
* In 2022, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Wakanda 5th in their &quot;The Avengers&#x27; 10 Best Allies In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

=== Cultural impact ===
* Russell Okung, an offensive tackle for the Los Angeles Chargers, introduced himself as an alumnus of &quot;Wakanda Tech&quot; during the starting lineups of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; in 2018. Okung actually attended Oklahoma State University; after the game, he tweeted that his fictional alma mater was &quot;coming for&quot; Alabama.
* In December 2019, it was discovered that the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s website listed Wakanda as a free-trade partner, with a list of traded goods which included ducks, donkeys, and dairy cows. The USDA claimed the fictional country had been added to the list &quot;by accident during a staff test&quot; and removed it soon after the public became aware of it.
* The Wakandan capital city, Birnin Zana, could offer an alternative for what future cities could be like in Africa. There are already many smart city initiatives being worked out in Africa, with many ecocities emerging across the continent.
* Senegalese-American singer Akon announced plans to build &quot;Akon City&quot;, a solar-powered &quot;real-life&quot; Wakanda on 2,000 acres of coastal land in Senegal inspired by Birnin Zana. He first shared his concept for a futuristic, technologically advanced city in 2018 and said it would welcome members of the African diaspora. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the project had secured $4 billion of the $6 billion investment necessary to build Akon City.
* Technology writers have also compared Wakandan principles to those expressed in African technology research. Anti-colonial AI, for example, has been described as &quot;in keeping with Wakandan principles&quot; by developing technology for benevolent purposes. It also seeks &quot;to avoid algorithmic exploitation and algorithmic oppression&quot; in artificial intelligence.
* The Wakanda name has also been adopted in small businesses. One example is Wakanda Place, an African and multicultural bar in Adelaide, South Australia. Entertainment at the bar includes DJs who play music from Africa and the African diaspora.
* Social media users in Indonesia often use &quot;Wakanda&quot; as a pejorative name for the country, initially used to criticise the government or law enforcement authorities. For instance, a tweet criticising the Indonesian police may read, &quot;Only in the country of Wakanda, law enforcers only act after it goes viral&quot;, instead of mentioning Indonesia directly. The use of such a disguise is intended to avoid problems with legal authorities amidst declining freedom of expression in Indonesia. A presidential candidate for the 2024 Indonesian presidential election, Anies Baswedan, promised to guarantee freedom of expression in Indonesia and once tweeted, &quot;Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever.&quot;

<text>The Tannu-Ola mountains (, &quot;Tañdı-Uula&quot;, , – Tangdy-Uula mountains; , &quot;Tağnîn nurú&quot;, , , ) is a mountain range in southern Siberia, in the Tuva Republic of Russia. It extends in an east–west direction and curves along the Mongolian border. Its highest peak reaches . The Tannu-ola mountains are mentioned in the 13th-century text &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot; under the name &quot;Tanglu mountains&quot; (唐麓), and also in the &quot;JāmiʿAl-tawārīkh&quot; of Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (1247–1318) under the name &quot;Toungat mountains&quot; (تنغات). By the Qing dynasty the name has been changed to Tangnu (唐努) mountains, from which the modern name is derived. All names are probably rooted in the old Turkic word &quot;taŋ&quot; - &quot;wonder, awe, wondrous.&quot;

== Geography ==
The northern slopes are part of the watershed of the Yenisei River, facing the western Sayan Mountains. The eastern end touches the large watershed of the Selenge River in Mongolia.
The foothills of the southern slopes cross into Mongolian territory. They form the northern limits of a large basin of steppes that extends south to the Mongolian Altay Mountains and includes the salt lake Uvs Nuur. The western end is located near the northern Altay Mountains in the Russian Altai Republic.

<doc id="1335380" wikidata="Q1355901" url="?curid=1335380" title="Exodus (1960 film)">
<text>Exodus is a 1960 American epic historical drama film about the founding of the State of Israel. Produced and directed by Otto Preminger, the screenplay was adapted by Dalton Trumbo from the 1958 novel of the same name by Leon Uris. The film stars an ensemble cast including Paul Newman, Eva Marie Saint, Ralph Richardson, Peter Lawford, Lee J. Cobb, Sal Mineo, John Derek and George Maharis. The film&#x27;s soundtrack music was written by Ernest Gold.

Preminger openly hired screenwriter Trumbo, who had been on the Hollywood blacklist for over a decade for being a communist and forced to work under assumed names. Together with &quot;Spartacus&quot;, also written by Trumbo, &quot;Exodus&quot; is credited with ending the practice of blacklisting in the US motion picture industry.

Released on December 15, 1960 by United Artists, the film earned $8.7 million at the box office in the United States and Canada, and $20 million worldwide.

==Plot==

After the Second World War, Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Fremont, a widowed American nurse, is sightseeing in Cyprus following a tour of duty for the U.S. Public Health Service in Greece. Her guide mentions the Karaolos internment camp on Cyprus, where thousands of Jews — many of them Holocaust survivors — are detained by the British, who refuse them passage to Palestine. Kitty visits British General Sutherland, who knew her late husband. When Sutherland suggests she volunteer at the internment camp for a few days, Kitty declines, citing she would feel uncomfortable around Jews. She reconsiders shortly after one of the General&#x27;s staff officers, Major Freddy Caldwell, makes an anti-Semitic remark.

Haganah rebel Ari Ben Canaan, a decorated former captain in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in the Second World War, obtains a cargo ship. He smuggles 611 Jews out of the camp and onto the ship for an illegal voyage to Mandatory Palestine. Military authorities discover the plan and blockade Famagusta harbor, preventing the ship&#x27;s departure. The refugees stage a hunger strike, during which the camp&#x27;s doctor dies and Ari threatens to blow up the ship and the refugees. The British relent and allow the ship, rechristened the &quot;Exodus&quot;, to sail.

While helping at the camp, Kitty meets Karen Hansen Clement, a Danish-Jewish teenager. Kitty grows fond of Karen and offers to take her back to America with her. Karen, whose mother and siblings were murdered in the Holocaust, is searching for her missing father. She has also aligned herself with the Zionist cause, and, wanting to go to Palestine, eventually turns down Kitty&#x27;s offer.

Meanwhile, opposition to partitioning Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states is intensifying. Karen&#x27;s young beau, Dov Landau, is recruited into the Irgun, a radical pro-Zionist militant group. Ari Ben Canaan&#x27;s uncle, Akiva, who heads the Irgun, first interviews Dov. Before swearing him in, Akiva forces Dov into confessing he was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz and was sodomized by the Nazi camp guards; this is where Dov acquired his bomb expertise. Akiva&#x27;s violent activities run counter to his brother Barak, Ari&#x27;s father, who heads the mainstream Jewish Agency, working to create a Jewish state through political and diplomatic means. Barak fears the Irgun will derail these efforts, especially as the British have placed a price on Akiva&#x27;s head.

Karen goes to live at Gan Dafna, a fictional Jewish kibbutz near Mount Tabor near the moshav where Ari was raised. Kitty and Ari have fallen in love, but Kitty pulls back, feeling like an outsider after meeting Ari&#x27;s family and learning about his previous love: Dafna, a young woman kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by Arabs, who is the namesake of the Gan Dafna kibbutz.

Ari helps locate Karen&#x27;s father, Dr. Clement, who is a permanent in-patient at a mental hospital in Jerusalem. He is in a dissociative state that is borderline vegetative, caused by the horrors he suffered in the past while in a Nazi concentration camp. When Karen visits, she is devastated that her father does not recognize her.

Akiva is arrested, imprisoned in Acre fortress, and sentenced to hang after the Irgun bomb the King David Hotel. The British authorities fail to heed a warning of the planned bombing which results in dozens of fatalities. Ari plots an escape to save Akiva&#x27;s life, and free Haganah and Irgun fighters imprisoned by the British military. Dov, who eluded capture after the hotel bombing, turns himself in to utilize his bomb-making expertise to facilitate the Acre Prison break.

Hundreds of prisoners escape, including Akiva, though he is fatally wounded as he and Ari evade a roadblock. Ari is also wounded, but makes it to Gan Dafna where Dr. Lieberman removes a bullet from Ari. With the British on Ari&#x27;s trail, he is taken to Abu Yesha, an Arab village near Gan Dafna, where his lifelong Arab friend, Taha, is the &quot;mukhtar&quot;. When a recovering Ari develops a life-threatening infection, Kitty saves his life. This rekindles their romance. Meanwhile, the British arrest Dr. Lieberman when they find an illegal weapons cache hidden within the children&#x27;s village.

The United Nations votes to partition the land into a &quot;Jewish State&quot; and an &quot;Arab State,&quot; but Arab nationals commanded by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, plot to attack Gan Dafna and massacre the Jews, including the children. Taha warns Ari of the impending attack, though he reluctantly says he must join the Grand Mufti in fighting the establishment of Israel. Ben Canaan orders the younger children be evacuated to safety during the night as a small detachment of Palmach troops arrives to reinforce Gan Dafna&#x27;s defenses.

Karen, ecstatic over the prospect of the new nation, goes to find Dov (who is on night patrol at the Gan Dafna perimeter) and proclaims her love for him. Dov says they will marry when the war is over. As Karen returns to Gan Dafna, she is ambushed and murdered by Arabs. Dov discovers her lifeless body the following morning. The same day, Taha&#x27;s body is found hanging in his village, killed by the Grand Mufti. A Star of David is carved into his body and a swastika and signs saying &quot;Jude&quot; are on village walls.

Karen and Taha are buried together in one grave. Ari eulogizes them, saying that someday Jews and Arabs will share the land in peace. While others in turn add a shovelful of dirt to the grave, Dov, angry and heartbroken, bypasses the shovel and moves on. Ari, Kitty, Dov, and a Palmach contingent board trucks, heading off to the battle.

==Production==
&quot;Exodus&quot; was filmed on location in Israel and Cyprus. Although filming key elements of &quot;Exodus&quot; on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus was authentic, as it was the location of the British internment camps for Jewish refugees trying to reach Palestine, it was difficult, as the island was in the middle of a Greek insurgency against British rule, led by the Greek nationalist organisation EOKA. EOKA was considered a terrorist organisation by the British authorities in Cyprus, who were opposed to the filming of a movie on the island that seemed to combine anti-British sentiments with a storyline that appeared to show terrorist action could be successful. As a result, the British authorities refused to help Preminger with the logistical side of filming. The only assistance given by the British authorities was the placement of an armed guard on the large number of decommissioned rifles used as props in the film, to prevent them from falling into the hands of EOKA and being recommissioned.

Relations between the director and actors were difficult, particularly with the male lead, Paul Newman. After Newman&#x27;s suggested changes to the script were rejected by Preminger, and the actor given a dressing down for making the suggestions, Newman hid a mannequin on a high balcony on which he was due to play out a fight scene. At the end of the scene, Newman pretended to stumble, and threw the mannequin over the balcony. Not realising this was a practical joke, Preminger collapsed and required medical attention. At other times, Preminger and Newman were barely on speaking terms.

Uris was originally signed to write a screenplay of the film, but Preminger rejected his script as excessively anti-British and anti-Arab. Preminger instead hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo, with whom he collaborated on a script in forty days. Trumbo had never visited Israel, resulting in initial errors, such as locating the site of the Acre prison break, located in a coastal city, as taking place in the middle of the desert. Trumbo also made less use of Biblical themes than Uris wanted. His biographer wrote that Trumbo refused &quot;to go back to Old Testament times, and follow the Jews through the centuries of the Diaspora and the horror of the Holocaust.&quot; Trumbo and Preminger did not share Uris&#x27;s preoccupation with history as moulding the Israeli national character.

Paul Newman and Eva Marie Saint had previously appeared together as the teenage lovers who subsequently marry in a 1955 musical version of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; with Frank Sinatra as the stage manager, an episode of the anthology television series &quot;Producer&#x27;s Showcase&quot;. Newman and Saint sing a duet during the malt shop sequence.

The Karen Hansen part was orginically offered to Hayley Mills, but her parents turned it down.

It was one of John Derek&#x27;s last appearances as an actor.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as a &quot;dazzling, eye-filling, nerve-tingling display of a wide variety of individual and mass reactions to awesome challenges and, in some of its sharpest personal details, a fine reflection of experience that rips the heart.&quot; The film&#x27;s &quot;principal weakness,&quot; Crowther wrote, &quot;is that it has so much churning around in it that no deep or solid stream of interest evolves—save a vague rooting interest in the survival of all the nice people involved.&quot;

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a kaleidoscopic yet memorable impression of highlights from the long-time best seller by Leon Uris,&quot; with a &quot;generally excellent&quot; screenplay by Trumbo. &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;There is room to criticize &#x27;Exodus&#x27;—its length might be shortened to advantage; perhaps Preminger tried to crowd too much incident from the book for dramatic clarity, and some individual scenes could be sharpened through tighter editing. But the good outweighs the shortcomings. Preminger can take pride in having brought to the screen a Twentieth Century birth of a nation.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the film &quot;has this vitality of the immediate and will be of incalculable influence in reaching those unfamiliar with the background of Israel ... It is safe to say that in several years, when this film will have played much of the world, its influence will have become critical.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Exodus&quot; lacks the historical imagination to cope with its theme on one level, the human awareness to dramatise it on the other. At the end of three and a half hours, its approach remains more exhausting than exhaustive. And the determination to be fair to all sides—almost the only character the script is prepared to dislike is the &quot;Nazi&quot; leader of the Arab terrorists—produces some strange consequences.&quot;

Roger Angell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Such a bubbling pot of intrigue, violence, and hatred would almost seem to guarantee a lively film, but Mr. Preminger has approached his task with a painstaking reverence that would have been more suitable if he had been filming the original work of this title. He permits nearly everyone in his large cast to state his ideological and political convictions before and after each new turn of events, and the result is an awesome talkfest that is all too rarely interrupted by the popping of rifles.&quot;

Reviews criticizing the film’s political message only appeared in less mainstream sources. For example, Gideon Bachmann, who was present in Palestine in 1947, wrote in Film Quarterly (published by University of California Press) that the film was &quot;dishonest&quot; and propaganda designed to be &quot;the best promotion Israel ever had.&quot;

The film holds an approval rating of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. On Metacritic, it has a 70/100, based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.

By September 1961, although having only played 22 locations overseas, the film had earned theatrical rentals of $14 million worldwide.

==Awards and nominations==
* The film was screened at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the competition for the Golden Palm.

==Soundtrack==

The musical score, by Ernest Gold, won the Academy Award for Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and the main theme has been widely recorded by other artists. A version by Ferrante &amp; Teicher reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January 1961. Other version were recorded by jazz saxophonist Eddie Harris, Mantovani, Grant Green, Manny Albam, Andy Williams, Peter Nero, Connie Francis, Quincy Jones, the 1960s British instrumental band the Eagles and the Duprees, who sang the theme with lyrics written by Pat Boone. Other artists to record the song include gospel pianist Anthony Burger (in the Gaither Vocal Band&#x27;s &quot;I Do Believe&quot;), Edith Piaf (who sang French lyrics) and classical pianist Maksim Mrvica. Davy Graham reinvented the main theme on his 1963 album &quot;The Guitar Player&quot;. Trey Spruance of the Secret Chiefs 3 rescored the theme for &quot;surf band and orchestra&quot; on the album 2004 &quot;Book of Horizons&quot;. Howard Stern uses it for comedic effect when discussing aspects of Jewish life. The WWF used the main theme as wrestler Mr. Perfect&#x27;s song. A portion of the theme was played live by &#x27;70s Southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas, whose three lead guitarists used eBows to play the theme in harmony, embedded into an arrangement of the Buddy Holly song &quot;Not Fade Away.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Often characterized as a &quot;Zionist epic&quot;, the film has been identified by many commentators as having been enormously influential in stimulating Zionism and support for Israel in the United States. While Preminger&#x27;s film softened the anti-British and anti-Arab sentiment of the novel, the film remains contentious for its depiction of the Arab–Israeli conflict.

<doc id="1335382" wikidata="Q857858" url="?curid=1335382" title="Oneida language">
<text>Oneida ( , autonym: 
/onʌjotaʔaːka/, /onʌjoteʔaːkaː/, People of the Standing Stone, Latilutakowa, Ukwehunwi, Nihatiluhta:ko) is an Iroquoian language spoken primarily by the Oneida people in the U.S. states of New York and Wisconsin, and the Canadian province of Ontario. There is only a small handful of native speakers remaining today. Language revitalization efforts are in progress.

In 1994, the majority of Oneida speakers lived in Canada.

==Ecology==

===Speakers and location===
Historically, the Oneida tribe was located in upstate New York in what is now the Utica area. During the early to mid-19th century, significant groups of Oneida migrated to Wisconsin and Ontario as a result of displacement driven by New York State following the American Revolutionary War. Today the population in New York includes about 1,100 members enrolled in the tribe; approximately 16,000 are in the Wisconsin tribe. The majority of these individuals speak English and use Oneida as a second language, if at all. Additional Oneida live in Ontario at the Six Nations of the Grand River and the Oneida Nation of the Thames settlement.

According to the National Virtual Translation Center, there are 250 speakers of Oneida, located in the Wisconsin and Ontario nations. Another source specifies that, in 1991, 200 Oneida speakers resided in the Thames (Ontario) Nation, and 50 in Wisconsin. Like many Indigenous peoples, the Oneida adopted and assimilated individuals of other tribes captured in warfare, and they would learn Oneida. Today the vast majority of current speakers are of Oneida descent.

===Role of Oneida language in Oneida society===
The Oneida culture places a strong focus on oral narrative tradition: so much so that in the absence of use as primary communication, this is the major societal role of the Oneida language. In the words of the Oneida Men&#x27;s Council and Clan Mothers, the &quot;traditional Oneida language is a vital link to our ancestors and national identity&quot;. These stories have long been used to develop social norms and pass along cultural capital via myths, folktales, and legends.

The Iroquois used three separate common names for these similar narratives: &quot;things which truly happened,&quot; &quot;it is as if an animal walked,&quot; and &quot;they went to the woods to hunt for meat&quot;. Respectively, these are stories of the mythology of the supernatural, of (often anthropomorphic) animals, and of parables or fables of human deeds.
The Oneida similarly have an extensive tradition of formal oratory and ritual tradition. Many Oneida political and diplomatic processes are highly formalized in this way, and spoken words are reinforced by the use of wampum, strings of symbolic shell beads, both in gesturing and as a gift indicating truth or seriousness.

The condolence ceremony, a ritual of succession of chiefdom, played a central role in the maintenance of the Iroquois Confederacy; the Three Bare Words ceremony, a metaphorical opening of the eyes, ears, and throat, preceded any diplomacy. Religious rituals as well made specific use of prescribed language, including the Onnonhouaroia (Midwinter) ceremony, a psychologically oriented celebration of dreams, and shamanistic medicine ceremonies Traditions of both oral narrative as well as ritual are in general a lesser part of Oneida culture today than they were up until post-colonial times. As the clan leaders indicate, the culture is valued, and the Oneida language is integral in enacting that culture.

===Situation of Oneida with regard to multilingualism and language shift===
Oneida is a secondary language: Oneida leaders write in English about the value of preserving Oneida language and culture. Almost all Oneida are either bilingual or monolingual English speakers; according to M. Dale Kincade, only six monolingual Oneida speakers remained in the United States in 1991. The Oneida have embraced the use of English since the colonial years, but Oneida Nation leaders continue to promote their language&#x27;s cultural relevance and work to preserve it through maintenance of the Oneida language and bilingualism.

During the Depression era, the Folklore Project was created to preserve and promote the Oneida language.

Due to its disuse as a common communicative language – and its extensive use as a prescribed ritual language – the alteration of Oneida by its speakers is minimized. Demus Elm&#x27;s retelling of the Creation Story, a linguistic act for which the form is not tightly prescribed, has limited space for language change. But, oral narratives change over time; Anthony Wonderley confirms that they do. Having fewer speakers to tell the stories reduces possibilities for mutation. Gick notes one of several minor changes from Elm&#x27;s morphology to Antone&#x27;s over the 25-year span between their narratives: the omission of the final syllable from one particular verb. He assesses that &quot;such differences simply indicate the two speakers&#x27; different ways of storytelling, or of speaking in general,&quot; rather than an appreciable linguistic shift.

===Assessment of the &quot;health&quot; of the Oneida language===
Oneida speakers were originally settled in New York State. They have since been factionalized, and are now found in three different communities in New York State, Wisconsin, and Ontario, Canada. The division began with the influence of a number of missionaries in the late 18th century to the early 19th century who convinced many Oneida to either accept Christianity or maintain their more traditional Oneida beliefs. Eleazer Williams, a Mohawk Indian, further convinced many Oneida to convert to Christianity and leave New York State to settle in an area near Green Bay, Wisconsin. As part of the larger conquest, the communities were further divided by the American Revolution when the governor of New York gave returning American soldiers parcels of Oneida land and they were told to relocate. Oneida took the side of the United States and the rest of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (also sometimes referred to as the Iroquois Confederacy) took the side of the English. Further division was created within the Wisconsin Oneida community, in which Oneida speaking children were taken away from their families and brought to boarding schools where they were only allowed to speak English. All of these factors have led to the decrease in speakers.

The UNESCO Major Evaluative Factors of Language Vitality consists of a detailed set of nine factors to access the vitality of a language. According to Factor 1: Intergenerational Transmission, Oneida is graded as a 1 or a degree of critically endangered. Oneida is used by very few speakers and most users are among the great-grandparent generation. Oneida is primarily spoken by the elders or leaders in the community, but the majority of speakers use it as a secondary language. Factor 2: Absolute Number of Speakers would consider Oneida critically endangered because of the low number of speakers in the population makes it vulnerable. The 2016 Canadian Census lists 55 mother tongue Oneida speakers in Ontario, making it at risk. Oneida would be graded as a 1 or a degree of highly limited domains on Factor 4: Trends in Existing Language Domains scale. Under this categorization, Oneida is used only in very restricted domains and for few functions. Oneida is spoken in the community for formal purposes surrounding topics related to their culture.

While numbers of native speakers are limited, the viability of the Oneida nations and their efforts of cultural and linguistic preservation are at their highest level in 150 years. All three Oneida nations, New York, Wisconsin, and Thames (Ontario), have relatively well-developed websites (www.oneidaindiannation.com; www.oneidanation.org; www.oneida.on.ca/index.htm) publicizing the current events of the tribes and their governmental actions. The presence of these sites is known to the public: the &quot;Central New York Business Journal&quot; reported that the site of the Oneida Nation of New York is the oldest nationally. These sites use a limited amount of Oneida language, almost exclusively in a context of explicit cultural preservation. The Oneida Nation of the Thames utilize their website to provide the public with information about their people, culture, community, and plans for the future. The site links to the Oneida Language and Cultural Centre website which provides additional information about the Oneida culture with links to videos, clothing, cultural symbols, prayers, clans, recipes, songs, stories, and history. In addition, information about Oneida language learning resources include lessons, classroom resources, learning resources, games, language proficiency tests, podcasts, written and spoken dictionaries, and videos to learn the language through their website.

Efforts to increase the number of bilingual Oneida speakers, however, have been extensive. Oneida language study has been formally sanctioned by the &quot;New York Oneida Nation&quot; for the past fifteen years and, through a collaboration with Berlitz to promote intensive language study, has been progressing rapidly since 2004. The Berlitz representative acting as liaison to the Oneida Nation identified the task as a particularly difficult one:

Berlitz divides languages into two sections of difficulty, A and B ... I&#x27;m going to make up a C list for Oneida. It is a very hard language. It will take a student more hours to learn because of the vocabulary. Word lengths are so long. Learning English can be compared to a train with one car following another and another; in Oneida it&#x27;s a circle.

Some language revitalization and preservation efforts have been made. Beginning in 1936 and led by Morris Swadesh, the Folklore Project, started at the University of Wisconsin, was an important program for the preservation and expansion of the Oneida language. It was later led by Floyd Lounsbury and formally started in January 1939. It lasted for nineteen months. Twenty-four Oneidas were placed in a two-week training session, in which they were told to write their language. Those considered the best writers would then complete the project. These writers were to meet every weekday and were to get paid 50 cents an hour as compensation for their time spent doing the study. By the end of the project, the participants, which was reduced to eight throughout the project, were able to write in their language. They collected stories, which were then also brought to the university staff, and were then transcribed.

The new revenues from casinos are helping the Oneida undertake language preservation. Extant literary works are recent: Elm &amp; Antone&#x27;s &quot;Creation Story&quot; was published in 2000, and Wonderley&#x27;s collection of stories in 2004. Although the time of the Oneida language as a primary language is almost certainly ending if it has not already ended, signs point to its continued use in a cultural context.

Primary products of documentation can be found at the Smithsonian Institution, the American Philosophical Society, Syracuse University Library, and The Oneida Language Audio Collection. The archives include documents relating to vocabulary, grammar, prayers, handwritten letters, photographs, census copies, exhibitions, books, manuscripts, pamphlets, analytics, maps, correspondences, documents, and audio files. Additionally, secondary products of documentation consist of dictionaries, grammar information, and texts. The dictionaries consist of complete entries of all Oneida lexicon, while grammar books describe sounds, words and sentence structure, and meanings. Among the texts, stories, hymns, prayers, videos, songs, language learning resources, and websites are present.

==History==

===Proposed genetic affiliation of Oneida===
Derived from Lounsbury&#x27;s work and her own original scholarship, Michelson presents a genealogy of the Iroquois language family, of which Oneida is a part. As attested by Gick, her work is among the little linguistic research on Oneida dating after Lounsbury&#x27;s definitive work. Iroquois has two major subdivisions, Northern and Southern; Southern Iroquois encompasses only Cherokee, which is at present by far the most widespread Iroquois language with in excess of 15,000 speakers. Lake-Iroquois languages make up the majority of Northern Iroquois, with the exception of &quot;nearly extinct&quot; Tuscarora and extinct Nottoway. Of the Lake-Iroquois languages, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca are extant, with only Mohawk having more than a thousand speakers. The close relation of Oneida with Mohawk and Onondaga is further substantiated by archaeological evidence of early Oneida villages, particularly Nichols Pond.

===History of the speakers of Oneida===
The Nichols Pond village site dates to approximately 1450, indicating the Onondaga as the probable immediate ancestors of the Oneida, as corroborated by a myth of the formation of the Oneida tribe by two Onondaga brothers. From this time, the Oneida remained largely sedentary through the arrival of French missionaries in the mid-17th century at their main settlement at Primes Hill in northern New York. Due to the centrality of hunting to the Oneida culture, clan membership was matrilineal (as men were often away) and tasks were divided along gender lines, both societal elements that are still at least nominally in place. The Oneida rapidly adopted French technology and integrated it with little cultural change into the common lifestyle. In their attempt to bring European religion, however, French missionaries, spearheaded by Jacques Bruyas, gradually succeeded in dismantling a significant portion of Oneida culture.

Under the leadership of Chief Good Peter, and against the rest of the Iroquois Confederacy, the Oneida backed the United States in the Revolutionary War. Oneida Castle at Primes Hill was destroyed in 1780 by loyalist forces, beginning a difficult era for the Oneida that resulted in their subsequent nearly complete assimilation into the new American way of life with respect to appearance, technology, and lifestyle Almost immediately after the end of hostilities, however, they suffered severe political abuse by the State of New York, and the vast majority of Oneida land was annexed. During this time, portions of the tribe broke off and relocated to Wisconsin and Ontario. This process of sequestration and demoralization culminated in 1850 with the appropriation by the City of Utica of the Oneida Stone, a long-standing symbol of the Nation.

Within the last ten to twenty years, the Oneida Nation of New York has been greatly revitalized by the establishment of the Turning Stone Resort and Casino. The funds generated from this enterprise have enabled the Nation to direct substantial effort to rebuilding both culture and territory (www.oneidaindiannation.com) and have led to the formation of a variety of other Nation-owned businesses (www.onenterprises.com). Most notably, in April 2005, the Oneida Nation of New York filed an ultimately successful application for federal land-into-trust territorial organization, limiting jurisdiction and tax liability, of Oneida territory to the Nation and the federal government.

===Written history of Oneida===
The written historical record of the Oneida has largely been written by outside individuals in foreign languages, either English or French. The script used for Oneida writing was developed by French missionaries, but writing by Oneida individuals is extant only from relatively recent years and is nearly exclusively in English. Prior writings about Oneida language and people recorded oral narratives, and even these accounts dropped off about 1930. It is only since the 1980s that the Oneida themselves have employed writing, in any language, at least in a public context, and much of this stems from the legal battles of the Nation. &quot;The Creation Story&quot; by Elm &amp; Antone is the only book written in Oneida in major publication, and much of the scholarship underlying this work, while certainly in collaboration with Oneida speakers, was done in English.

==Structure==

===Phonology===

There are four oral vowels, , and two nasal vowels, (written ) and (written ). Vowel length is indicated with a following colon, .

Like other Iroquois languages, Oneida has a relatively limited inventory of vowels and a fairly standard set of consonants, though it is exceptional for lacking bilabial consonants. According to Gick, &quot;all consonants sound similar to English&quot; with a few exceptions involving fricatives and the glottal stop. Oneida lacks bilabial stops and labiodental fricatives. Oneida syllables are largely CV, and VV appears in disyllabic sequences ai, ae, ao, and au. Consonants can also cluster in particular arrangements up to CCCCC in the word-medial position; word-initial or word-final clusters are limited to CCC. Oneida generally accents on the penultimate syllable, and shares with Mohawk the &quot;PLI rules that ... lengthen an accented open penult&quot;. Basic register tone results from the Oneida accent system but is not contrastive.

===Morphology===
Oneida is polysynthetic and has substantial noun incorporation. Affixes are both prefixing and suffixing depending on precise usage. Verbs take three aspects: habitual, punctual, and stative, which are marked via suffixing. Modal prefixes (future, factual, and optative) fill the role of verb tense; non-modal prefixes are often adpositional. Oneida is head-marking, and designates person and number in this way. These so-called &quot;patient prefixes&quot; take singular, dual, or plural forms to mark the inclusive-exclusive distinction.

Oneida exhibits three parts of speech: verbs, nouns, and particles. Adjectives are described as attributive verbs in all cases. Verbs are always marked for person and gender, of which there are 4 (masculine, neuter, feminine-zoic, and feminine-indefinite). There is one main difference between the two feminine genders, in that the feminine-indefinite is always used as an epicene, while the feminine-zoic is used for both inanimate referents and feminine animals. Other differences are controversial between speakers, although the use of the feminine-zoic can indicate a more informal relation, while the feminine-indefinite can indicate a formal relation.

==== Incorporated counting ====
To say one of any object involves the following pattern:
* &quot;s- + ka-&quot; + root + &quot;w-&quot; (for a-stems) + &quot;-at&quot; (iterative)
: prepronominal prefix + pronoun prefix + noun root + (plus extender) + verb root

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
PRENOM:prepronominal prefix
NMZ:nominalizer
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;


To say two of any object involves the following pattern:
* &quot;te- + ka-&quot; + root + &quot;w-&quot; (for a-stems) + &quot;-ake&quot; (dualic)
: prepronominal prefix + pronoun prefix + noun root + (plus nominalizer) + verb root

(Oneida Indian Nation 34–36)

===Syntax===
Oneida either is verb-initial or has no dominant form. Interpretation of Elm&#x27;s portion of the text of the Creation Story itself reveals a clear verb-initial word order, but Antone&#x27;s portion does not, suggesting that word order is variable by speaker and that flexible usage is grammatically acceptable. Oneida constructs sentences in the active voice only.

==Sources==
This document summarizes several of the texts most central to the study of Oneida. Karin Michelson&#x27;s &quot;A Comparative Study of Lake-Iroquoian Accent&quot; scientifically evaluates in depth many of the linguistic specifics of the Oneida language and its relatives, continuing the seminal work of Floyd Lounsbury from 1946. Anthony Wonderley, historian of the New York Oneida Nation, provides the best-recognized account of historical factors and their interplay with Oneida culture in &quot;Oneida Iroquois Folklore, Myth, and History&quot;. Finally, &quot;The Oneida Creation Story&quot;, compiled by Floyd Lounsbury and Bryan Gick from the narratives of Demus Elm and Harvey Antone, provides considerable insight into the use of the Oneida language as it is perceived by the Oneida people. Conspicuously missing, unfortunately, is direct reference to Lounsbury&#x27;s &quot;Oneida Verb Morphology&quot; and &quot;Phonology of the Oneida Language&quot;, among several others.

In the words of Ray Halbritter, the National Representative of the New York Oneida Nation: &quot;Oneidas have a history as distinguished and tragic as that of any people. ... But there is nothing traditional about poverty and despair. ... As soon as we built up resources from gaming and other enterprises, we turned back to our cultural heritage strongly committed to preserve and revitalize it&quot;. Today, the Oneida language and the long history it encompasses is jeopardized by the limited number of speakers and the danger of cultural irrelevance, but the zeal of its leaders for the preservation of the culture may maintain the life of the language. Through the work of Floyd Lounsbury and others, texts &quot;of great linguistic value&quot; like Elm and Antone&#x27;s serve to accomplish this purpose.

<doc id="1335384" wikidata="Q713909" url="?curid=1335384" title="Tan Cheng Lock">
<text>Tun Sir Tan Cheng Lock KBE, SMN, DPMJ, JP () (5 April 1883 – 13 December 1960) was a Malaysian Peranakan businessman and a key public figure who devoted his life to fighting for the rights and the social welfare of the Chinese community in Malaya. Tan was also the founder and the first president of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA), which advocated his cause for the Malayan Chinese population.

==Background==

Born on 5 April 1883, Tan was the third son of Tan Keong Ann (), who had seven sons and daughters, and was a fifth generation Peranakan-Hokkien Chinese Malaysian living at 111, Heeren Street () in Malacca. His ancestor, Tan Hay Kwan (), a junk owner and trader, had migrated to Malacca from Zhangzhou prefecture in Fujian Province, China in 1771. His grandfather, Tan Choon Bok (), was very wealthy but he felt his four sons were unworthy to inherit his business empire and wealth and locked his assets in a family trust which ended 84 years after he died, in 1964. By then Tan Cheng Lock had been dead for four years. Tan Cheng Lock&#x27;s father, Tan Keong Ann, was so devastated by his &#x27;disinheritance&#x27; that he railed at his father&#x27;s portrait daily and took to drink. He did not try to earn a living to support his family and instead lived off his annual allowance of $130 (Straits dollars) from the family trust in genteel poverty. Tan Cheng Lock refused to emulate his father.

The young Tan attended Malacca High School and won the Tan Teck Guan Scholarship awarded to top performers in the school. He later continued his education at the Raffles Institution in Singapore. He was unable to proceed to England to study law due to his financial situation so he decided to teach instead, and taught at the Raffles Institution from 1902 to 1908. He was unhappy with his lot and was too impatient to be a teacher, so his mother, Lee Seck Bin, insisted he return to Malacca to work as an assistant manager of the Bukit Kajang Rubber Estates Ltd., a company which belonged to his maternal cousin, Lee Chim Tuan. Being a rubber planter suited him and he was a quick learner. Soon he was appointed visiting agent to Nyalas Rubber Estates in Malacca in 1909. In 1910, Tan was involved in the founding of three rubber companies. He started United Malacca Rubber Estate Ltd. himself, and he obtained the assistance of other businessmen to jointly set up Malacca Pinda Rubber Estates Ltd. and Ayer Molek Rubber Company, Ltd.

Three years later in 1912, he was nominated as Malacca Council Commissioner and a Justice of the Peace for Malacca by the British government. Months later, he was also nominated as the Commissioner of the Town Council for the towns and Malacca port as well. In 1914, he resuscitated the Chinese Company of the Malacca Volunteer Corps (later also known as B Company, 4th Battalion, Straits Settlement Volunteer Force) and served as a private for five years until 1919. In 1915, he revived the Straits Chinese British Association (SCBA), electing him as the President of SCBA soon after. In 1923, at the age of 40, he was appointed as a nominated member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements.

In 1926, Tan made a speech to the legislative council about the ideals of a territorially and politically united Malaya. Like many Straits-born Chinese of his time, Tan was partial towards Britain but was deeply influenced by ideas of independence which were sweeping across many British colonies. He advocated for a &quot;united self-governing British Malaya&quot;. From 1933 to 1935, he was an unofficial member of the Straits Settlements Executive Council. He championed social causes like opposing opium smoking, promoting Chinese vernacular education, legislating against polygamy and pressing for immigration policy reform. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, Tan and his family lived in exile in India. They witnessed the struggles of Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for independence during their stay in India, which inspired them to do the same for Malaya when they returned.

==The Malayan Chinese Association==

Tan returned to Malacca after the Japanese surrendered. On 27 February 1949, Tan founded the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) alongside Tun Leong Yew Koh () and Colonel Lee Hau Shik. Although he was 66 when elected to the position, Tan was regarded as the only man able to bring the Malayan Chinese together.

The post-war years and the Emergency was a difficult and dangerous juncture for the community. The Chinese were deeply divided and their loyalty was under scrutiny. Among the Chinese, only Tan had the stature to engage with senior Malays such as Datuk Onn Jaafar and Tunku Abdul Rahman. Strongly anti-communist, he was also trusted by the British colonial officials. He joined the Malay leaders – first through the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action, which he chaired, and then the Communities Liaison Committee headed by Dato&#x27; Sir E. E. C. Thuraisingham – to fight for constitutional change and work towards inter-ethnic co-operation. Tan organized a hartal (general strike) in Malacca to protest against the British colonial government.

The establishment of the Federation of Malaya did not go down well with the ethnic Chinese, as favourable conditions for obtaining citizenship for the Chinese and other non-Malays were withdrawn. Tan Cheng Lock frequently raised grievances over the citizenship terms that were set when the federation was established. As a result, communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese surfaced, and Onn Jaafar, who was then heading UMNO kept his distance from Tan. Tan encountered initial difficulties with meeting Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, who was not accustomed to working with Chinese businessmen.

The goal for the foundation of the Malayan Chinese Association was to unite the Chinese population in Malaya, including the protection of the rights and interests of the Chinese, to work with the colonial government to stop the spread of communism and to work with other races to achieve independence for Malaya. The MCA branches had been set up after their campaigns had attracted more than 200,000 members.

On 26 September 1951, he supported Onn Jaafar&#x27;s idea to form the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP) in Kuala Lumpur with co-operation of various races as its theme. However, the formation was choppy, due to the fact that Onn Jaafar was not co-operative on the issue of citizenship.

In the end, Tan decided that only a Chinese party could safeguard the interests of his community and that multi-ethnic co-operation was more likely to be achieved through partnership with UMNO. With that, the MCA joined with UMNO to form the Alliance Party, the precursor to the Barisan Nasional. However some people do not agree that he acted in best interest of Malaysian Chinese as some felt that the marginalization of Malaysian Chinese would not be so severe had the British continued to rule citing Hong Kong as an example.

In 1952, Tan Cheng Lock and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) under Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s leadership contested the election as partners. He was best remembered for his contributions in the business and political arenas and his work for integrating between the Chinese and the Indian communities to Malayan society.

Under Tan Cheng Lock, the MCA played a vital role in negotiating independence from the British; he was also in charge as the MCA formed the Alliance in 1954 in coalition with the United Malays National Organisation and the Malaysian Indian Congress. Tan, who was a member of the Malayan Anti-Japanese League, was MCA&#x27;s first president, but did not enter the cabinet on independence because his rival, Tun H.S. Lee, from Selangor, was part of the cabinet.

Prior to the independence of Malaya, he was also a member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. In 1952, Tan Cheng Lock and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) under Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s leadership contested the election as partners. He was best remembered for his contributions in the business and political arenas and his work for integrating between the Chinese and the Indian communities to the nascent Malayan society.

Tan died of a heart attack on 16 December 1960 at the age of 77. His son, Tan Siew Sin became the 3rd President of MCA after his death.

Many tributes were made to Tan, for his contributions to Malaysia. Besides being recognised as one of the founding fathers of modern-day Malaysia, along with Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tun Abdul Razak and Tun V.T. Sambanthan, the street named &quot;Foch Avenue&quot;, adjacent to the Petaling Street was renamed &quot;Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock&quot; in Kuala Lumpur after 1957. The former Cross Street was renamed Tan Siew Sin Street in honour of Tan&#x27;s son, a former Finance Minister of Malaysia. In Malacca, Heeren Street where Tan&#x27;s family home and the place of his birth was situated was also renamed &quot;Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock&quot; in his honour. In 2002, a school was built at Subang Jaya in the state of Selangor and was named SJKC Tun Tan Cheng Lock.

In April 2005, the National University of Singapore (NUS) received a private donation of S$4 million from Ms Agnes Tan, the last surviving daughter of Tan Cheng Lock, to acquire a Peranakan house on Neil Road in Singapore. Another donation of S$1.5 million was made for the purpose of acquiring two other houses on Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock in Malacca for the conservation and promotion of Peranakan architecture and culture in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. The house in Singapore was named the &quot;Tan Cheng Lock Baba House&quot;, in honour of Tan&#x27;s strong belief in education.

<text>In number theory, the continued fraction factorization method (CFRAC) is an integer factorization algorithm. It is a general-purpose algorithm, meaning that it is suitable for factoring any integer &quot;n&quot;, not depending on special form or properties. It was described by D. H. Lehmer and R. E. Powers in 1931, and developed as a computer algorithm by Michael A. Morrison and John Brillhart in 1975.

The continued fraction method is based on Dixon&#x27;s factorization method. It uses convergents in the regular continued fraction expansion of
:formula_1.
Since this is a quadratic irrational, the continued fraction must be periodic (unless &quot;n&quot; is square, in which case the factorization is obvious).

It has a time complexity of formula_2, in the O and L notations.

<doc id="1335394" wikidata="Q5722729" url="?curid=1335394" title="Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon">
<text>Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon (c. 153514 December 1595) was an English Puritan nobleman. Educated alongside the future Edward VI, he was briefly imprisoned by Mary I, and later considered by some as a potential successor to Elizabeth I. He hotly opposed the scheme to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Duke of Norfolk, and was entrusted by Elizabeth to see that the Scottish queen did not escape at the time of the threatened uprising in 1569. He served as President of the Council of the North from 1572 until his death in 1595.

==Early life==
===Education===
Hastings was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, the eldest son of Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, and Catherine Pole in 1535 or 1536. Through his mother, he was descended from George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, who was a brother of King Edward IV. This gave him some claim to the throne. Hastings was educated at first by private tutors at his family manor. A year or so senior to Edward VI, Hastings joined the young prince at his studies at the king&#x27;s invitation. He was tutored under Richard Cox, John Cheke and Jean Belmain. They provided both youths with an education based on a Protestant version of the principles of Renaissance Humanism. In 1548 he spent a brief period at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, profoundly influenced by the evangelical Protestantism he encountered at court and at the university.

===Marriage and imprisonment in the Tower of London===
His father was a political ally of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and to further their alliance the two elder politicians arranged the marriage of their children. On 21 May 1553, Henry was wed to Katherine Dudley, daughter of Northumberland by Jane Guildford.

In 1553, Edward VI was dying and his appointed heir was his cousin Lady Jane Grey, Northumberland&#x27;s daughter-in-law. Jane&#x27;s reign lasted only from 10 to 19 July 1553 until her cousin Mary I of England prevailed. Due to his marital alliance, Henry backed Northumberland in his attempt to divert the succession in favour of Lady Jane Grey in July 1553, and on Mary Tudor&#x27;s triumph he found himself incarcerated in the Tower of London. Mary attempted to reconcile with the Hastings family and soon they were free again and by oath loyal to her.

Henry entered the household of his great-uncle Cardinal Reginald Pole and followed him in his visits to Calais, Flanders and the monasteries of Smithfield, London. The two men also escorted the later Philip II of Spain from the Seventeen Provinces to the Kingdom of England for his marriage to Mary. Despite his personal loyalty to Mary and his great-uncle, Hastings practised Calvinism and showed little financial restraint in supporting his puritan beliefs. Among those notables who benefited from his family&#x27;s friendship and patronage were John Brinsley the elder, Arthur Hildersham, Thomas Cartwright, Lawrence Humphrey, Thomas Sampson, Anthony Gilby, John King, and William Chaderton.

==Political career==

He had been loyal to Edward VI, Jane and Mary I during their respective reigns and his father remained an influential politician. When Mary I died childless and was succeeded by her younger half-sister Elizabeth I in 1558, the new queen also counted on the reliable Hastings family among her supporters. Together with the second earl, Lord Hastings received a summons to the Lords in the first parliament of Elizabeth, and attended assiduously, being present (among much else) at the passage of the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity in the spring of 1559. Henry was named a Knight of the Bath by the new queen regnant.

His father died on 25 January 1560 and Henry became the third Earl of Huntingdon. He thus assumed responsibility for his widowed mother and his ten siblings.

===Stunted rise to power===
With his humanist education, experience of court life, and a brother-in-law, Robert Dudley, high in the new queen&#x27;s favour, Huntingdon might well have expected early advancement. However, at the time few members of the Tudor dynasty remained alive and several descendants of the previous English royal house of Plantagenet were seen as possible heirs to the throne. Huntingdon was among these possible heirs and won a certain amount of support, especially from the Protestants and the enemies of another claimant Mary, Queen of Scots. Huntingdon soon discovered that his Yorkist ancestry barred his way. Indeed, when Elizabeth fell ill with smallpox in October 1562, the Protestant group put him forward as a potential successor and, though he subsequently did all in his power to convince her of his loyalty, the queen proved very slow thereafter to employ him outside his native county of Leicestershire.

===President of the Council of the North===
However, he was still useful to her. It was doubtless felt that the earl&#x27;s own title to the crown was a pledge that he would show scant sympathy with the advocates of Mary&#x27;s claim. For three months during the northern uprising in the autumn of 1569, he assisted George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury to remove the Scottish queen from Wingfield Manor to Tutbury. He is often mentioned - negatively - in coded letters from Mary, Queen of Scots, to the French ambassador. He was later one of the peers at her trial in 1586. 

Elizabeth formally recognised his service by creating him a Knight of the Garter in April 1570 alongside William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester, and from this time seems to have regarded him as a candidate for promotion. The rebellion of the earls had demonstrated the ineffectiveness of Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex as president of the council in the north, in 1572 Huntingdon was appointed president of the Council of the North. Throughout the period the north of England stood as a buffer zone against Scotland, still in a highly volatile state after Mary&#x27;s flight.

He was prominent and active in the preparations of 1588 for the Spanish invasion.

==Later life==

Having gone north to Newcastle to oversee the musters in the autumn of 1595, Huntingdon planned to join his wife at court for Christmas. On his return to York in late November, however, he fell ill with a fever and died there on 14 December 1595. 

At court, Elizabeth went out of her way to comfort his distraught widow, though she did little to mitigate the debts. Childless, Huntingdon had educated Francis Hastings, the eldest son of his brother, Sir George Hastings, as his heir, sending him for a time to Geneva. Francis&#x27;s ten-year-old son Henry was being brought up in his great-uncle&#x27;s household at York in 1595. Since his brother had died intestate, George, fourth earl of Huntingdon, tried to avoid taking up the administration of his estate, but the queen insisted upon Huntingdon&#x27;s being given a funeral commensurate with his rank, and he was buried with his nephew, Francis, who only outlived him by three days, at St Helen&#x27;s Church, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, on 26 April 1596.

A portrait of Huntingdon in armour dated 1588 now hangs in the Tower. Huntingdon was responsible for the compilation of an elaborate history of the Hastings family, a manuscript copy of which is now in the British Museum.

<doc id="1335399" wikidata="Q6838745" url="?curid=1335399" title="Mickey Mouse degrees">
<text>Mickey Mouse degrees (or Mickey Mouse courses) is a term for university degrees or courses regarded as worthless or irrelevant. The term is a dysphemism, originating in the common usage of &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; as a pejorative. It came to prominence in the UK after use by the country&#x27;s national tabloids.

==Origins==
The term was used by the Minister of State for Universities Margaret Hodge, during a discussion on higher education expansion. Hodge defined a Mickey Mouse course as &quot;one where the content is perhaps not as rigorous as one would expect and where the degree itself may not have huge relevance in the labour market&quot;; and that, furthermore, &quot;simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses is not acceptable&quot;. Hodge herself received a 3rd class degree in Economics. Similarly, many of her colleagues in the House of Commons have studied Politics Philosophy and Economics and in June 2024 Kay Burley asked the Education Minister Damian Hinds if his PPE degree from Oxford was not indeed a Mickey Mouse degree. This opinion is often raised in the summer when exam results are released and new university courses revealed. The phrase took off in the late 1990s, as the Labour government created the target of having 50% of students in higher education by 2010.

==Examples==
Comedian Jay Leno quipped that “in college, philosophy majors study if the glass is half full or if the glass is half empty. See, this prepares them for careers later as waiters.&quot;

In 2000, Staffordshire University received negative press coverage when a module on the sociological importance of football which had been designed for students taking sociology, sports science, or media studies was portrayed as a &quot;degree in David Beckham Studies&quot;. A professor for the department stressed that the course would not focus on Beckham, and that the module examines &quot;the rise of football from its folk origins in the 17th century, to the power it&#x27;s become and the central place it occupies in British culture, and indeed world culture, today&quot;. In July 2015, UK Independence Party MEP Louise Bours referred to the module on &quot;Question Time&quot;, but as though it was a full degree course. Other degrees deemed &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; include &quot;golf management&quot; and &quot;surf science&quot;. Durham University designed an optional module centred around Harry Potter to examine &quot;prejudice, citizenship and bullying in modern society&quot; as part of a B.A. degree in Education Studies.

One thing these courses share is that they are &quot;vocational&quot;, which are perceived to be less intellectually rigorous than the traditional academic degrees.

Defenders of these courses object that the derogatory comments made in the media rely on the low symbolic capital of new subjects and rarely discuss course contents beyond the titles. Another factor is the perception that the take up of these subjects, and the decline of more traditional academic subjects like science, engineering, or mathematics, is causing annual grade rise in the United Kingdom.

==A-level subjects and &quot;soft options&quot;==
The A-level in General Studies is seen as a Mickey Mouse subject, as well as A-level Critical Thinking, with many universities not accepting it as part of the requirements for an offer.

Additionally, although not considered Mickey Mouse subjects as such, some qualifications are not preferred by top universities and are regarded as &quot;soft options&quot;. A 2007 report stated that the sciences were more challenging than subjects such as Media Studies, which might be taken by students to get higher grades for university applications. An American example is a degree in physical education. These have been issued to members of the college&#x27;s athletics teams, to make them eligible to play; otherwise they would fail to pass traditional subjects.

<doc id="1335430" wikidata="Q819982" url="?curid=1335430" title="Toyota RAV4">
<text>The is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. It is known for starting the wave of compact crossovers. The RAV4 is one of the best-selling SUVs of all time. By February 2020, a total of 10 million RAV4s had been sold globally. In February 2025, the RAV4 replaced the Ford F-150 as the top selling car in the United States, after nearly four decades of the F-150&#x27;s reign.

It made its debut in Japan and Europe in 1994, and in North America in 1995, being launched in January 1996. The vehicle was designed for consumers wanting a vehicle that had most of the benefits of SUVs, such as increased cargo room, higher visibility, and the option of full-time four-wheel drive, along with the manoeuvrability and fuel economy of a compact car. The vehicle&#x27;s name is an abbreviation of &quot;Recreational Active Vehicle with 4-wheel drive&quot;, or &quot;Robust Accurate Vehicle with 4-wheel drive&quot;, although not all models come equipped with the four-wheel drive system.

For the third-generation model, Toyota offered both short- and long-wheelbase versions of the RAV4. Short-wheelbase versions were sold in Japan and Europe; long-wheelbase versions in Australia and North America. Toyota of Japan also sold the longer-wheelbase version as the at Toyopet Store dealership chain from 2005 through 2016. RAV4 for the Japanese market were sold at two different Toyota dealership chains, Corolla Store and Netz.


== First generation (XA10; 1994) ==

The first-generation RAV4, known as the XA10 series, was constructed on a unique platform that shared Carina and Corolla elements. It launched in Japan in May 1994. Design and development commenced in 1989 under code-name 153T, with design approval and start of production development in the second half of 1991 on the 3-door version and in 1993 for the 5-door version. In March 1995, the 5-door was launched and introduced to the US in January 1996, with standard dual airbags.

The XA10 series was available in both three and five door versions. In the US, a 2.0-litre straight-four producing was available. Both front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive were available, and the RAV4 could be had with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. It was named the &quot;1997 Automobile of the Year&quot; by &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;. The 1996-1997 model years had headlamps with a bracket push in type, dual filament bulb. The front running/turn signal lamps used older round socket dual filament bulbs. The rear used round socket type bulbs as well. In 1997 for the 1998 model year, the RAV4 was slightly restyled on the front and rear fascias, and a soft top three-door was made available. Power was increased slightly to . In June 1999, the two-door hardtop was dropped from the American lineup, leaving the five-door and soft top models. The 1998–2000 models used a single filament headlamp, with two different beams per housing (low and high beam) opposed to the original single beam with dual filaments. The rear lamps use the more modern rectangular style bulbs (7440/7443). The interior has subtle changes such as different colored seats, different colored door panels, extra cup holders on certain models (cigarette lighter/cup holder duo), and a digital odometer. In Japan, the 2.0-litre &quot;3S-GE BEAMS&quot; engine with was also available. Some variants of the 1998 Toyota RAV4 were labeled as SXA11 rather than XA10, paired with an owner-given name of &quot;RAV 4.1&quot;.

The 1996 RAV4 got between 21 and 23 miles per gallon (4.2 to 4.8 gals per 100 miles) of combined city/highway driving.

=== RAV4 EV ===
The RAV4 EV is a plug-in, all-electric variant of the RAV4. Produced from 1997 to 2003 for fleet lease, this &quot;zero emission&quot; model was only offered for public sale for seven months in 2002, in very small quantities in California. Powered by an advanced Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack capable of storing 27 kWh, the RAV4 EV can go up to between charges, and came with a battery warranty. A total of 1,484 units were leased and/or sold in California, and as of mid-2012, almost 500 units were still in use.

=== Facelift ===


== Second generation (XA20; 2000) ==

The second-generation RAV4, known as the XA20 series, went on sale in July 2000. Like the previous model, the XA20 was available in three- and five-door configurations and was constructed on a platform that shared Carina and Corolla elements. Development began in 1995, with a design freeze in the first half of 1998. Styling was done at Calty Design Research Incorporated (also simply known as Calty) by Yasuhide Hosoda and Kevin Hunter from 1996 to 1997.

The second-generation RAV4 was originally offered in a number of trim levels in the UK: NV was front-wheel drive, while NRG, GX, and VX were permanent four-wheel drive with differing levels of equipment. Although the RAV4 was available as a three-door in Europe, Asia and Australia, the American model was only available in a five-door configuration. A 1.8-litre inline-four engine (only with 2WD) producing , 2.0-litre inline-four engine producing , 2.4-litre inline-four engine producing , and a D-4D diesel engine were available.

In Australia, the RAV4 came in base Edge and upmarket Cruiser models in both three- and five-door configurations. All models came equipped with a brand-new 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine featuring VVT (variable valve timing), resulting in improved power and torque, as well as fuel consumption. Permanent four-wheel drive was featured. The second generation RAV4 enjoyed success in Australia, where it became the best-selling SUV in the country in 2001, overtaking its rival the Honda CR-V for the first time.

=== Facelift (2003) ===
In late 2003, the 2004 model RAV4 was given a styling update, improved equipment, and, in certain markets, a new engine. In the United States the safety structure was improved and Vehicle Stability Control made standard. The RAV4&#x27;s 2.0-litre engine was upgraded with a new 2.4-litre engine in the US and Australia producing and . Other countries got mostly 5-door models with the 2.0-litre VVT-i engine. Automatic electric air conditioning also became available. European models got a new catalytic converter because of the new European emission policy. The new model also got an electric throttle.

In Australia, for the facelift, the base Edge was renamed CV, and gained standard air conditioning (previously an option). The CV also received painted bumpers, which came in either silver or body-colored shades, depending on the body color. In addition, the model range was given a subtle facelift, consisting largely of a new front bumper with circular fog lights and white turn signals instead of the older orange lights. In 2005, a new &quot;CV Sport&quot; model was added to the range in Australia, which included a non-functional bonnet scoop, giving the RAV4 a more aggressive appearance. The CV Sport model was short-lived, lasting only a year, and was introduced primarily to stimulate sales until the new model arrived in early 2006.

The second generation RAV4 had the highest proportion of female drivers among all makes and models in the United States, with the possible exception of the Volkswagen New Beetle, according to 2003–2004 registration and survey data.

== Third generation (XA30; 2005) ==

The Toyota RAV4 was redesigned for the 2006 model year, using an all-new platform, and was first unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.

The third-generation RAV4 was offered in two versions: a short- or a long-wheelbase model. The short-wheelbase model was sold only in Japan, Europe and New Zealand (diesel only in NZ), with the long-wheelbase RAV4 sold in Australia, New Zealand and North America. In comparison with the previous generation model, the wheelbase of the short-wheelbase model was increased by , while exterior dimensions are longer and wider than the previous model. The extended-length version has an additional 21% in interior volume from the last generation, and had an optional third-row for two additional passengers (North America and Japan only). Since 2007, the extended-length RAV4 was also sold alongside its shorter counterpart in Japan as the Toyota Vanguard, which uses a revised front-end body work incorporating a revised grille, bumper, bonnet and headlamps.

The third-generation RAV4 went on sale in Japan in 2005 at Netz dealers. As the XA30 series RAV4 was not available with a 3-door option, the previous generation 3-door RAV4 was dropped in the beginning of 2007. The XA30 series RAV4 was sold in Japan until July 2016, where the XA40 was not to be offered. Toyota discontinued the Vanguard in November 2013 in favour of the redesigned XU60 Harrier.

For this generation, the RAV4 could be optioned with either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive in North America and Japan; while most countries only sell the four-wheel drive version. In the Japanese market four-wheel drive RAV4, between 97 and 98 percent of power is typically distributed to the front wheels, until it senses a loss of traction then up to 45 percent of power will go the rear wheels. The European market model is able to be locked into a 50:50 ratio.

The third-generation RAV4 is also equipped with electric power steering (EPS) system, an optional keyless entry system marketed as Smart Entry and Start System and nine airbags for the first time. In the interior, the RAV4 uses a two-tiered instrument panel which was designed to improve the feel of roominess. 

Another addition for the third-generation RAV4 is the option of a V6 engine in some markets. It is a 3.5-litre &quot;2GR-FE&quot; petrol engine that is rated at , which is capable of acceleration in around six seconds.

In 2008 (for the 2009 model year), the RAV4 was given a mid-cycle refresh in some markets, featuring a number of changes, including an all-new four-cylinder engine, and a redesigned front end and tweaked rear end. Much of the interior remains as before.

In 2010 (for the 2011 model year), the RAV4 underwent another facelift, based on the Vanguard&#x27;s styling.

The vehicles were built in Toyota&#x27;s Tahara, Aichi assembly plant, and under contract by Toyota Industries in its Nagakusa, Obu, Aichi plant. Beginning in November 2008, vehicles for the North American market were built in the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada Inc. at the new West Plant in Woodstock, Ontario. Beginning in March 2009, Chinese models began production by Tianjin FAW Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. in a joint-venture plant in Tianjin, China.

In 2015, the XA30 series RAV4 was awarded the WheelsTV pre-owned vehicle of the year title.

=== Safety ===
The RAV4 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants, 4 stars for toddlers, and 3 stars for pedestrians from Euro NCAP in 2006.

=== Markets ===

==== Japan ====

Model ranges include X, G and Sport, replacing RAV4 L and RAV4 J. The &quot;X&quot; and &quot;G&quot; can be ordered with either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The &quot;Sport&quot; model with over fenders is four-wheel drive only. The extended-length RAV4 was sold in Japan as the Toyota Vanguard, released in August 2007. It was sold in five- and seven-passenger versions and slots between the regular RAV4 and Kluger. As it was often the case in Japan-only vehicles, the Vanguard comes loaded with high-tech gadgets, including steering-assisted stability control, keyless entry and satellite navigation. The Vanguard received a facelift in 2010.

Unlike the North American variant that came with a 4-speed automatic gearbox, the Japanese RAV4 (or Vanguard) is equipped with a simulated 7-speed transmission from the &quot;K112&quot; line also known as Super CVT-i Sports Sequential Shiftmatic. That was along with the upgraded &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; that was rated at .

When the larger XA40 arrived in 2012, the short wheelbase model was kept in production for the Japanese market and sold instead of the new version until 2016.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, the third-generation RAV4 was sold in four-cylinder base &quot;CV&quot;, &quot;Cruiser&quot;, &quot;Cruiser L&quot; and the limited edition &quot;Altitude&quot; trim levels, and &quot;CV6&quot;, &quot;SX6&quot;, and &quot;ZR6&quot; are 6-cylinder variants. The V6 was available from 2007.

==== Middle East ====
In the Middle East, the third-generation RAV4 was available with a 2.4-litre engine. Most markets, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), get the four-wheel drive model with an automatic gearbox, but KSA additionally gets a two-wheel-drive model as well, the base one with a manual gearbox.

==== North America ====
North American models include choices of 2.4-litre &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; inline-four or 3.5-litre &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine. The V6 model has . In model year 2009, a slightly larger 2.5-litre &quot;2AR-FE&quot; inline-four replaced the previous 2.4-litre engine. Either four-cylinder engine came equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission. The North American RAV4 with 3.5-litre &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine is fitted with a five-speed automatic transmission. All US models feature Toyota&#x27;s Star Safety System which includes Vehicle Stability Control. The new RAV4 topped Toyota SUV sales in the United States for the first time.

No manual transmission or diesel engines are available on North American models.

Facelifted for the 2009 model year, North American models include the choice of a new &quot;2AR-FE&quot; inline-four or &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine. In 2009, it was also the first time that the Canadian market received a front-wheel drive model to lower the price of entry.

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico, the third-generation RAV4 was available in Base and Limited trim levels, but on the Limited trim 4WD became an option and the Base model added 17-inch steel wheels but the roof rack was still standard in both trims. For the refresh of 2009 the roof rack in the Base model was eliminated as standard equipment and the Sport trim was added to the line-up. Up to 2008MY all RAV4s in Mexico had four-cylinder engines but for 2009 the Sport model became available with the V6 engine, although the four-cylinder engine was still available. The Limited trim was only available with the V6 engine and four-wheel drive. For 2010, the RAV4 in Mexico has been simplified again to two trims but the Limited trim was dropped and consequently removed the four-wheel drive option, while the Base and Sport trims remained unchanged from 2009.

==== China ====
The XA30 RAV4 commenced production in China in April 2009. Trim levels were the 2.0 Classic, 2.0 Luxury, 2.0 Luxury Navi, 2.4 Luxury and 2.4 Luxury Navi. The 2.0-litre &quot;1AZ-FE&quot; and 2.4-litre &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; were standard paired to a 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic gearbox.

The China-specific model had different styling compared to those sold in other countries, with a black strip that was placed in between the radiator and license plate like a moustache. It also had chrome bars below the front and rear bumpers. The license plate was also moved to the bottom bumper area to make way for the RAV4 logo and a rear fog lamp. Front and rear parking sensors are also standard.

=== RAV4 EV ===
Toyota worked together with Tesla Motors to develop the second generation RAV4 EV; the electric SUV was scheduled for market launch late in the third quarter of 2012. Production was limited to 2,600 units during the first three years, and sales were limited to California only, beginning with the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and San Diego.

The second generation RAV4 EV has a motor powered by a 41.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that Toyota expects to deliver a US Environmental Protection Agency rated range of in standard charge mode and in extended charge mode, for a combined range of and a combined fuel economy rating of . The RAV4 EV battery pack and electronic components are similar to those used in the Tesla Model S sedan launched in June 2012, because Tesla Motors is the manufacturer of the powertrain. About 2,500 RAV4 EVs were built between 2012 and August 2014, with the battery supply deal between Toyota and Tesla concluding with the end of production.

== Fourth generation (XA40; 2012) ==

The fourth-generation RAV4 was a complete redesign; it was revealed at the November 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show. Unlike the previous generations, it featured a rear liftgate rather than a side-opening rear door and no longer had the spare wheel mounted on the rear door.

The RAV4 no longer offers a V6 engine like the previous generation—all engine choices were inline four-cylinder engines. Also, while the previous XA30 model was offered in regular and extended wheelbase lengths, the XA40 was only sold in a single wheelbase length (corresponding to the long wheelbase XA30).

The full hybrid system combined a 2.5-litre Atkinson cycle petrol engine with an electric motor, a high voltage generator, a 204-cell nickel–metal hydride battery located under the rear seats, a power control unit, and a power split device. RAV4 Hybrids were available in both front and four-wheel drive variants. The four-wheel drive came equipped with a second, 50 kW high-voltage, a rear-mounted electric motor that offers increased traction and a towing capacity. The rear&#x27;s electric motor operates independently from the hybrid system front&#x27;s electric motor, driving the rear wheels alone. US sales began in early January 2013.

=== Markets ===
For the Japanese market, the previous generation in short-wheelbase length remained on sale in Japan until 2016 instead of the newer, export only, XA40. The Harrier replaced the long-wheelbase model in Japan, previously badged as the Vanguard.

In Australia, the fourth-generation RAV4 went on sale in February 2013. Engine choices included a 2.0- and 2.5-litre four-cylinder petrol, and 2.0- and 2.2-litre turbo-diesels. Transmissions included a six-speed manual (UK/Australia only), Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), and six-speed automatic.

The UK model went on sale in 2013. Early European models included a choice of a 2.0-litre petrol or one of three 2.0-litre diesel engines.

The RAV4 manufactured in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada had about 50 percent of its parts coming from Japan.

Taiwanese models included a 2.0-litre Dual VVT-i inline four-cylinder engine with CVT or 2.5-litre Dual VVT-i inline-four engine with six-speed automatic.

Production in China commenced in August 2013 and was sold alongside the XA30 model for a short time. The XA40 RAV4 in China came standard with the 2.0-litre &quot;6ZR-FE&quot; and 2.5-litre &quot;5AR-FE&quot; petrol engine. 6 speed manual, automatic and CVT gearboxes are standard. Seven trim levels were available.

Production in Russia started in August 2016.

=== Facelift (2015) ===
In 2015, for the 2016 model year, Toyota released a facelift for the XA40 series. The facelift debuted with the RAV4 Hybrid shown at the April 2015 New York International Auto Show. The facelift included redesigned LED front and rear lamps and updated speedometer dials with full color TFT multi information display.

=== RAV4 Adventure and RAV4 Premium (2013) ===
The RAV4 Adventure is a concept vehicle that accentuated the car&#x27;s look to reinforce its off-road capabilities. It included dark red body color, extended wheel arches, 20-inch alloy wheels and matte painted front and rear bumpers.

The RAV4 Premium is a concept vehicle with Deep Bronze body color, bumpers in Deep Bronze, chrome-finished spoiler, chrome inserts in the rear bumper, brushed aluminium skid plates, integrated tailpipe at the rear bumper, 20-inch wheels, leather interior upholstery designed by Toyota&#x27;s Kansei design department, seats with black piping and V-shaped outline, two-tone double stitching and grey and black leather on the instrument panel and door panels.

Both vehicles were unveiled in March 2013 at the Geneva Motor Show.

A production version of the RAV4 Adventure was added to the US lineup in September 2017.

=== Safety ===
The Japan-made RAV4 in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 3 airbags received 5 stars for adult occupant and 4 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2015.

The RAV4 in its standard European market configuration received 5 stars from Euro NCAP in 2013.

In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) evaluations, the 2013 and 2014 model year RAV4 achieved a &quot;good&quot; crashworthiness rating for head restraints and seats, roof strength, side, and moderate overlap front, while achieving a &quot;poor&quot; rating in the IIHS Small Overlap Frontal Test. Modifications were made starting in the 2015 model year which increased the small overlap front rating to &quot;good&quot;.

The small overlap test, introduced in 2012 by the IIHS, simulates a frontal collision on 25 percent of the driver&#x27;s side. Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, including the RAV4. Another small overlap test was conducted on a number of vehicles, including a 2015 RAV4, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. The RAV4 fared the worst and would have received a &quot;poor&quot; rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test&#x27;s intrusion was further into the vehicle on the passenger&#x27;s side than on the driver&#x27;s side and caused the passenger door to open during the crash.

== Fifth generation (XA50; 2018) ==

The fifth-generation RAV4 was unveiled at the March 2018 New York International Auto Show. The design was previewed by the FT-AC concept shown at the December 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show. It is built on the same TNGA-K (GA-K) platform as the XV70 series Camry. Both 4-cylinder petrol-powered and petrol-electric hybrid (Hybrid Synergy Drive) variants would remain available. No diesel engine option is offered for this generation.

Development of the model was led by chief engineer Yoshikazu Saeki. Built on the GA-K platform, the unibody chassis of the fifth-generation RAV4 is 57 percent more rigid than the previous generation. The model incorporates a multi-link rear suspension to which is claimed to provide more ideal damping for handling, lesser interior cabin noise, and enhanced ride comfort.

For improved forward visibility around the A-pillar, Toyota positioned the side mirrors lower on the doors. The lowered beltline and the enlarged rear quarter glass also increased the side visibility from inside the car. Forward visibility is also enhanced by the positioning of the lower instrument panel and tucked-in windshield wipers.

The fifth-generation RAV4 also introduced a newly developed four-wheel drive system, marketed as &quot;Dynamic Torque Vectoring AWD&quot;. Claimed to be a world-first adoption, it is a torque vectoring type, which independently distributes torque to the left and right rear wheels according to driving conditions. A disconnect mechanism, marketed as &quot;Rear Driveline Disconnect&quot;, is incorporated to transmit driving force only to the front wheels when 4WD is deemed unnecessary.

For hybrid models, all-wheel drive model utilized the &quot;E-Four&quot;/&quot;AWD-i&quot; system. The updated system increases the total torque to the electronically driven rear wheels by 30 percent compared to the AWD system used in the previous generation. A new control system allows torque distribution to the front and rear wheels to be changed from between 100:0 to 20:80. A standard AWD system without torque vectoring is also available for petrol models.

The non-hybrid 2018 RAV4 got between 24 and 26 miles per gallon (3.8 to 4.2 galllons per 100 miles) of combined city/highway driving.

<text>[[Count]] Gavrila &quot;Gavriil&quot; Ivanovich Golovkin (; 1660 – 20 January 1734) was a Russian statesman who formally presided over foreign affairs of the Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire from 1706 until his death. The real control over Russian diplomacy during his lengthy term in office was exercised by Boris Kurakin until 1727 and by Andrey Osterman after his death.

In 1677, while still a young man, Gavrila Golovkin was attached to the court of the tsarevich Peter, with whose mother Nataliya he was connected, and vigilantly guarded him during the disquieting period of the regency of Sophia. He accompanied the young tsar abroad on his first foreign tour, and worked by his side in the dockyards of Zaandam. In 1706, he succeeded Golovin in the direction of foreign policy, and was created the first Russian grand-chancellor on the field of Poltava (1709). Golovkin held this office for twenty-five years.

In the reign of Catherine I, he became a member of the Supreme Privy Council, which had the chief conduct of affairs during this and the succeeding reigns. The empress also entrusted him with her last will whereby she appointed the young Peter II her successor and Golovkin one of his guardians. On the death of Peter II in 1730, he declared openly in favour of Anna, duchess of Courland, in opposition to the aristocratic Dolgorukovs and Galitzines, and his determined attitude on behalf of autocracy was the chief cause of the failure of the proposed constitution, which would have converted Russia into a limited monarchy. Under Anna, he was a member of the first cabinet formed in Russia, but had less influence in affairs than Osterman and Munnich.

In 1707, Golovkin was created a count of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1710 a count of the Russian Empire. He was one of the wealthiest, and at the same time one of the stingiest, magnates of his day. His ignorance of any language but his own made his intercourse with foreign ministers very inconvenient. For the ultimate disgrace of his relatives, see the Lopukhina Affair. Yury Golovkin, Russia&#x27;s first ambassador to China, was his great-grandson.

<text>Darryl Quinn Hamilton (December 3, 1964 – June 21, 2015) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1988 and 2001 for the Milwaukee Brewers, Texas Rangers, San Francisco Giants, Colorado Rockies, and New York Mets. Hamilton prepped at Louisiana State University Laboratory School in Baton Rouge and then attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana.

==Baseball career==

===Milwaukee Brewers===
Hamilton was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 11th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft and signed a contract with them on June 12, 1986. He made his professional debut that season with the Helena Gold Sox of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, hitting .391 in 65 games. In 1987 with the Stockton Ports of the Class A California League, he hit .328 in 125 games with eight homers and 61 RBI, on a team that was rated one of the top farm teams in Brewers history. He began 1988 with the Denver Zephyrs of the Class AAA American Association, where he hit .325 in 72 games.

Hamilton made his MLB debut on June 3, 1988, as a defensive replacement for Robin Yount in the top of the seventh inning against the California Angels. Then, in his first at-bat, in the bottom of the inning, he singled to center field off Stew Cliburn of the Angels for his first major league hit. He hit his first home run off Bret Saberhagen of the Kansas City Royals on July 19, 1988. In 44 games with the Brewers during the second half of the 1988 season, Hamilton hit .184. His most notable moment that season was during his first start in left field, on September 3, he collided with shortstop Dale Sveum while chasing a blooper over third base. They collided with such force that Sveum&#x27;s leg snapped, causing him to miss the rest of the season and all of the 1989 season and derailing his career. Hamilton avoided injury but spent the entire 1989 season back in the minors with the Zephyrs, where he hit .286 in 129 games.

In 1990, despite missing time with injuries, Hamilton played in 89 games and hit .295. He was awarded with the Brewers &quot;Unsung Hero Award&quot; in 1990 and the &quot;Good Guy Award&quot; in 1991 when he hit .311 in 122 games while still dealing with an assortment of injuries.

Hamilton stole 41 bases for the Brewers in 1992, while hitting .298 in 128 games. The Brewers as a team stole 256 bases, which was almost 100 more than the second place American League (AL) team.

In a game on August 28, 1992, at SkyDome, in Toronto, before a crowd of 50,408, the Brewers set an AL record by recording 31 hits in a single game in a 22–2 rout of the Toronto Blue Jays. Hamilton had four hits and five RBI in that game.

When long-time Brewer star Paul Molitor left via free agency before the 1993 season, Hamilton became more important to the Brewers offense. He had some more injuries this season, but Hamilton still led his team in batting average (.310), hits (161), singles (130) and stolen bases (21) and was awarded with the team&#x27;s &quot;Harvey Kuenn Award.&quot;

The Brewers decision to move Hamilton from right field into center field for the 1994 season contributed to Hall of Famer Robin Yount&#x27;s decision to retire after the 1993 season.

In 1994, Hamilton played in only 36 games (hitting .262) before he was shut down for the season and underwent reconstructive elbow surgery. Despite missing most of the season, the Milwaukee chapter of the Baseball Writers Association voted him the recipient of the &quot;Michael Harrison Award&quot; for community service. Hamilton was also one of the Brewers player representatives during the leadup to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike.

In his final season as a member of the Brewers, in 1995, Hamilton played in 112 games and hit .271 with 11 stolen bases. In his seven seasons with the team, he had an overall .290 batting average in 666 games and hit 23 home runs, drove in 253 RBI and stole 109 bases. After the 1995 season, the Brewers declined Hamilton&#x27;s $2.5 million contract option, making him a free agent. Hamilton filed a grievance against the Brewers, claiming he had been benched in the final weeks of the season in order to keep him from reaching 550 plate appearances which would have automatically picked up the option. The grievance was resolved in an undisclosed negotiated settlement.

===Texas Rangers===
Hamilton signed with the Texas Rangers on a one-year, $1.3 million, contract on December 14, 1995, for the 1996 season. He was critical of the Brewers when he signed with the Rangers, saying they were not interested in building a winning team. Hamilton played in a career best 148 games with the Rangers and was their regular starting center fielder. He hit .293 with six homers and 51 RBI and also stole 15 bases. He described his experience with the Rangers as &quot;great.&quot; Hamilton did not make an error all season and led all center fielders in putouts as the Rangers put a premium on defense that season. The Rangers won the American League West division and the first playoff berth in franchise history. In the 1996 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Hamilton had three hits in 19 at-bats as the Rangers dropped the series three games to one .

===San Francisco Giants===
Hamilton signed a two-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on January 10, 1997. On June 12, he got the first hit in the first-ever regular-season interleague game, when the Giants defeated the Rangers 4–3. In 125 games, Hamilton had a .270 batting average, five homers, 43 RBI and 15 stolen bases. In the 1997 National League Division Series, Hamilton was hitless in five at-bats as the Giants were swept in three games by the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. He followed that up by playing in 97 games for the Giants in 1998 and hitting .294.

===Colorado Rockies===
The Giants traded Hamilton and Jim Stoops to the Colorado Rockies for Ellis Burks on July 31, 1998. Hamilton was surprised by the trade, wanting to complete his contract in San Francisco. In 51 games he hit .335. He re-signed with the Rockies after the 1998 season for one year and $3.6 million and played in 91 games in the 1999 season with an OBP of .374 for them.

===New York Mets===
Hamilton was traded to the New York Mets with Chuck McElroy for Rigo Beltrán, Brian McRae, and Thomas Johns on July 31, 1999. He played with the Mets through the 2001 season. In his three seasons with them he played in 150 games and hit .283. Hamilton and the Mets played in the post-season in both 1999 and 2000. In 1999, the Mets made the playoffs as a result of winning a one game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds. Once in, they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1999 National League Division Series before losing to the Atlanta Braves in six games in the National League Championship Series. Hamilton had six hits in 17 at-bats in that series.

In 2000, the Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games in the 2000 National League Division Series and the St. Louis Cardinals in five games in the 2000 National League Championship Series. Hamilton was a part-time player in the series, with only five at-bats in the division series and two in the championship series. In the 2000 World Series against the New York Yankees was hitless in three at-bats with two strikeouts as the Yankees won the series in five games. Hamilton was disappointed with his playing time during the playoffs and had a meeting with manager Bobby Valentine during spring training the following year to discuss his reduced playing time. Things did not improve for him and he asked for his release at the end of June, and it was granted on July 11, 2001. He signed a minor league contract with the Rockies a week later, but was released on July 25 after four games with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He retired at the end of the 2001 season.

Over his 13-year career, Hamilton batted .291, with 51 home runs and 454 RBI in 1328 games. As an outfielder, he collected 2711 putouts and 45 assists, committing only 14 errors in 2770 total chances, for a .995 fielding percentage.

==Broadcasting career==
Hamilton worked for MLB Advanced Media from 2003 to 2006 and also worked for NBC Sports Network&#x27;s &quot;Sports Talk&quot; and KPRC-TV in Houston. Also in Texas, Hamilton lent his voice to KFNC and KGOW. At the conclusion of the 2006 baseball postseason, Hamilton began working in the Major League Baseball Commissioner&#x27;s Office of On-Field Operations, reporting to Vice President Bob Watson.

In 2012, Hamilton was named as a color analyst for a limited series of Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim games to be broadcast nationally by Compass Media Networks radio. In 2013, he joined the MLB Network as an on-air analyst. In 2014, Hamilton served as a part-time color analyst on Brewers radio broadcasts, rotating with Craig Counsell and Jerry Augustine to call games with Joe Block when primary announcer Bob Uecker was absent.

==Personal life==
Hamilton was married in 1994 to &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; anchor Shaun Robinson; they later divorced. Hamilton married fashion model Ursaline Steinke in 2000, with whom he had two sons, Donovan and Julian.

At the time of his death, Hamilton was living in an affluent neighborhood in suburban Houston, Texas, in a house belonging to his girlfriend, Monica Jordan. Jordan, a graduate of Florida State University and University of Houston Law Center, was an attorney who had been employed by Enron and Halliburton. The couple had a son together in 2014.

==Death==
Around 4:45 p.m. on June 21, 2015, Hamilton, 50, and his ex-girlfriend, Monica Jordan, 44, were found dead in their Pearland, Texas, house, in what appeared to be a murder–suicide. Investigators said it appeared Hamilton had been shot more than once and Jordan died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Hamilton and Jordan&#x27;s 14 month-old child was found alive by police in the home and taken into the custody of Texas Child Protective Services. According to Pearland police, there did not appear to have been a struggle and the incident &quot;occurred just inside the front door.&quot; A third party called 9-1-1.

According to Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne, Jordan previously pleaded guilty to felony arson in 2008 arising from a 2006 incident in which she burned down the house in which she had been living with her then-husband Rohaven Richards. Jordan allegedly had suspected Richards of cheating on her and chased him around the house while trying to douse him in gasoline.

Hamilton&#x27;s remains are interred in Southern Memorial Gardens in Baton Rouge.

<text>Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge in Illinois is a four-lane bidirectional road bridge that spans the Illinois River, Illinois Route 351, Illinois and Michigan Canal, and local roads and railroads. It carries Interstate 39 (I-39), a major north-south Interstate through central Illinois, and its U.S. Route counterpart, U.S. Route 51 (US 51).

==Description==
The bridge crosses the river between LaSalle and Oglesby, at river mile 225.8. The structure comprises a main span over the river, flanked by 43 approach spans. It is named after Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States. The main span is a through-arch design, long. The clearance of this span over the river, from low steel of the bridge to normal water level in the pool below, is . With the approach spans, the total length of the structure is . Its length makes it the longest bridge in Illinois.

== History ==
The bridge was built in 1987 when I-39 was first extended south to what is now Illinois Route 251. The highway itself has since been extended all the way to the Bloomington–Normal area. In 2007, the bridge was rehabilitated due to the poor performance of the existing precast deck panels and the frequent surfacing of potholes. On October 31, 2008 the rehabilitation project was completed 15 days ahead of the contract requirement.

<text>Amazon Light was an alternate user interface to Amazon.com built on the Amazon Web Services API. The site was developed by Alan Taylor, a former Amazon programmer, while he still worked for the company. The site was funded through Amazon affiliate links.

The website was intended to be a simpler and more efficient way to access Amazon.com and use its features. It allowed the user to search or browse Amazon&#x27;s database of books, music, DVDs, and VHS tapes, and add items into a list. The list was then used to add the items into the user&#x27;s Amazon.com shopping cart where they could then be purchased.

Amazon Light originally used a layout which resembled the main page of the Google search engine. In July 2002, Google&#x27;s lawyers told it to cease and desist.

Amazon Light 4.0 won the &quot;Technical Achievement award&quot; at the South by Southwest Web Awards in 2005.

In July 2009, Alan Taylor announced on his blog that &quot;Amazon Light (all four versions) will shut down.&quot;

<text>The Records were an English power pop band formed in 1978. They are best remembered for the hit single and cult favourite &quot;Starry Eyes&quot;.

==Music career==
The Records formed out of the ashes of the Kursaal Flyers, a pub rock group featuring drummer Will Birch. In 1977, John Wicks joined the band as a rhythm guitarist, and he and Birch quickly started writing songs together, Wicks as composer, Birch as lyricist. The Kursaal Flyers dissolved three months after Wicks joined, but he and Birch continued to write songs together with the hopes of starting a new four-piece group with Birch on drums and Wicks on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Birch soon came up with a name for the formative band: The Records. The group&#x27;s line-up initially included bassist Phil Brown and lead guitarist Brian Alterman, whose guitar riffs have been compared to those of the Byrds. Alterman played on two early demos that were later included on the album &quot;Paying for the Summer of Love&quot;, before joining another band. Alterman was replaced by Huw Gower in 1978. Like Birch and Wicks, Gower and Brown were music veterans: Gower had played with a band called the Ratbites from Hell, and Brown had been the bass player for the Janets.

The new group was heavily influenced both by bands like the Beatles and the Kinks, and early power pop groups such as Badfinger, Big Star, and Raspberries. Power pop was experiencing a renaissance on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks in large part to the burgeoning punk/new wave movement.

They were hired to back Stiff Records singer Rachel Sweet on the &quot;Be Stiff Tour &#x27;78&quot;. The Records opened the shows with a set of their own. Birch and Wicks also wrote a song for Sweet&#x27;s debut album entitled &quot;Pin a Medal on Mary&quot;. The songwriting duo also penned &quot;Hearts in Her Eyes&quot; for the Searchers, who made an unexpected comeback with their power pop oriented album &quot;The Searchers&quot; in 1979.

Based on their demos (later released as &quot;Paying for the Summer of Love&quot;), the band was signed to Virgin Records in 1978. Their debut single, &quot;Starry Eyes&quot;, was released in the UK that December and has since become their best-known song, and an oft-covered power pop standard. AllMusic called it &quot;a near-perfect song that defined British power pop in the &#x27;70s&quot;. Due in part to its clear influence by American power pop, the song was a bigger hit in the US than in the UK; it peaked at No. 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in October 1979.

===&quot;Shades in Bed&quot;===
The group prepared their debut album with producers Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange and Tim Friese-Greene. Huw Gower produced &quot;The Phone&quot;, which was added to the album in preference to one of Lange&#x27;s efforts, a cover of Tim Moore&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Love Letter&quot;. The debut LP, &quot;Shades in Bed&quot;, yielded another single, &quot;Teenarama&quot;, their second-best known song. The album was released in the US in July 1979 as &quot;The Records&quot; with different song sequencing and with the original single version of &quot;Starry Eyes&quot; replacing Lange&#x27;s re-recording that appeared on the UK edition. The album was sufficiently well received to peak on the Billboard chart at No. 41. Gower also produced the bonus four track disc of cover tunes included in the album release, which also received FM airplay, notably the version of Spirit&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;, which was strong enough to become short-listed by Virgin as the second single off the album.

That was the pinnacle of their success. Returning to the UK, Will Birch engaged the services of producer Craig Leon to record two new songs and to remix two tracks from &quot;Shades in Bed&quot; for a possible single release. Huw Gower acted as co-producer. After an aborted German tour with Robert Palmer, Gower left the band and relocated to New York, where he joined forces with New York Dolls lead singer David Johansen. Their collaboration led to the successful album &quot;Live It Up&quot;.

===&quot;Crashes&quot;===
Jude Cole, a 19-year-old American, who had been in Moon Martin&#x27;s backing group The Ravens, joined for the album &quot;Crashes&quot; (1980). The album was not a hit, and did not yield any successful singles, and record company support for the band dried up during the &quot;Crashes&quot; tour. Cole stayed in the US, while the core of Birch, Wicks and Brown returned home to England.

===&quot;Music on Both Sides&quot;===
The trio expanded into a quintet with guitarist Dave Whelan and lead singer Chris Gent. Previously, most of the songs had been sung by Wicks, but with other members frequently taking lead vocals for individual songs. Birch has since declared that the decision to recruit a lead singer was made &quot;perhaps unwisely&quot;. This line-up recorded a third album for Virgin, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Music on Both Sides&quot;. Like its predecessor, the album was not a hit.

===Breakup and aftermath===
After this, the band effectively broke up. Birch turned to tour managing, running &#x27;Rock Tours&#x27;, a sightseeing London Bus venture, producing and writing. In 1990, the original band briefly reformed to contribute a track for the 1991 Brian Wilson tribute album, &quot;Smiles, Vibes &amp; Harmony&quot;. Birch, Brown and Wicks cut the basic track for &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot; in London; Gower added his parts and mixed it in New York. The same year also saw the US release of &quot;Paying for the Summer of Love&quot;. Both recordings received great press, but were not enough to outweigh unresolved past issues within the core membership, which effectively killed any possibility of restarting the group. Wicks relocated to the US in 1994 and was writing, recording and performing both solo and with a new incarnation of the band up until 2018.

Brown died following an undisclosed degenerative illness, on February 2, 2012. Wicks died following a year-long struggle with cancer on October 7, 2018 in Burbank, California.

<text>Tan Tock Seng (; 1798 – 24 February 1850) was a Malacca-born merchant and philanthropist from Singapore.

==Early life and business==
Tan Tock Seng was born in Malacca in 1798 to a Chinese Fujianese immigrant father and local Peranakan mother. He left for Singapore in 1819 at the age of 21, the same year Stamford Raffles established a trading base on the island under the British East India Company. Tan made a living by selling vegetables, fruits, fish and other produce in the newly-built city center and eventually earned enough to open a store at Boat Quay in 1827. The store was situated at the mouth of the Singapore River.

He then invested in the J. H. Whitehead of Shaw, Whitehead &amp; Company and engaged in property speculation, becoming wealthy in the process and acquiring large tracts of prime land. Tan owned 50 acres (200,000 m²) near the Tanjong Pagar railway station, disjointed land parcels from the Padang leading up to High Street and Tank Road, several Ellenborough Building shophouses, and even a fruit plantation.

==Philanthropist==
Tan became an influential Chinese leader and was the first Asian to be appointed Justice of the Peace by Governor William John Butterworth. He was also granted the title of Kapitan Cina (Captain of the Chinese) for settling feuds and assisting new Chinese immigrants upon their arrival to Singapore. The founding of Thian Hock Keng temple was led by Tan for the Hokkien community and still exists at Telok Ayer Street today.

His most famous donation was a $5,000 contribution to the construction of the Chinese Pauper Hospital in 1844, which was named after its benefactor on its opening and referred to colloquially as &quot;Tan Tock Seng hospital&quot;. The hospital later relocated to the corner of Serangoon Road and Balestier Road in 1860, and a female wing was funded by Tan&#x27;s widow Lee Seo Neo in 1867.

==Death and legacy==
Tan died on 24 February 1850 at the age of 52 after falling ill, leaving behind his wife, three sons and three daughters. His initial burial location is unknown but his remains were re-interred at Outram Hill around 1882. The modern day Tan Tock Seng Hospital and adjacent road Jalan Tan Tock Seng still bears his name.

<text>Count Fyodor Vasilyevich Rostopchin () ( – ) was a Russian statesman and General of the Infantry who served as the Governor-General of Moscow during the French invasion of Russia. He was disgraced shortly after the Congress of Vienna, to which he had accompanied Tsar Alexander I. He appears as a character in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s 1869 novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;, in which he is presented very unfavorably.

==Biography==
Rostopchin was born in the Kosmodemyanskoe village (modern-day Livensky District, Oryol Oblast of Russia) into a Russian noble family, the son of Vasily Fyodorovich Rostopchin (1733–1802), a landlord and former army major, and Nadezhda Aleksandrovna Rostopchina (née Kryukova) who died shortly after giving birth to his younger brother Peter. Rostopchin&#x27;s date and place of birth, as well as his family roots are still questioned by biographers. While the date 12 March 1763 is written on his tombstone, other sources, including Rostopchin himself, pointed at 1765 as the real year and Moscow – as the real place of his birth.

He also claimed that his family was very ancient and originated around the 15th century from Crimean Tatars, direct descendants of Genghis Khan. In Part 2 of the All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses he named some Boris Davydovich nicknamed Rostopcha (from Russian &quot;rastopcha&quot; which means &quot;scatterbrain, blockhead&quot;) who arrived to Moscow to serve Vasili III of Russia, while in Part 4 his name changed to Boris Fyodorovich and later official encyclopedias renamed him to Mikhail Davydovich. His descendants supposedly served in Moscow, Tver, Klin and Rzhev at various army and state positions, yet none of them left any trace in Russian history, and some modern historians consider it to be a mystification.

He spent most of his childhood and youth at his father&#x27;s family estate in the Kosmodemyanskoe village where he received home education. He was fluent in English, German, French and Italian languages, and from 1786 to 1788 he traveled to Europe. This trip, especially the time spent in Berlin, influenced his later views and his passion for self-education. He described it in his first book &quot;The Trip to Prussia&quot; (1792–1794) which has been compared to the &quot;Letters of a Russian Traveller&quot; by Nikolay Karamzin.

Feodor Rostopchin started his military career as a member of the Preobrazhensky Regiment in 1775, and in 1785 he was promoted to Podporuchik. He took part in the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790) and the Russo-Turkish War (1788–1791). During the Russo-Swedish War he lost his younger brother Peter Rostopchin whom he later described in his patriotic novel &quot;Oh, Those French!&quot; He served under Alexander Suvorov who distinguished him. They became good friends, and Rostopchin later defended Suvorov during his exile and was near him during his death.

Rostopchin had great influence over Paul I of Russia. In 1796 he was appointed adjutant general, grand-marshal of the court, and in 1799 – the President of the Collegium of Foreign Affairs. Same year he was granted the title of Count. His opposition to the French alliance and the murder of Paul I in 1801 resulted in his falling out of favor. He spent 10 years living in his family estate and writing comedies and satirical novels in which he ridiculed Francophiles. He was restored to favor in 1810 as conditions between France and Russia began to deteriorate. At the end of May 1812 he was appointed a Governor-General of Moscow. He was visited by Germaine de Stael on her way to St. Petersburg and Stockholm.

During the French invasion of Russia he was responsible for the defence of the city against Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée, and he took every means available to rouse the population of the town and district to arm and join the army to defend the city against the invaders. After the Battle of Borodino it was clear to the Russian generals that their army could not deal with another battle; half of the population left the city, according to Leo Tolstoy. Rostopchin was invited to the council at Fili but excluded after a few hours and had the remaining population of the city evacuated, including all the city administrators and officials, leaving behind only a few French tutors, foreign shop keepers. In addition, the prisons and asylums were opened and the inhabitants set free by his order. No one came to meet the Emperor Napoleon with keys when he arrived at the city gates on 14 September in the afternoon. On the first night of French occupation a fire broke out in the bazaar and a number of small fires erupted in other quarters. As the French rode through the streets to the Kremlin they found the streets deserted. That night the city began to burn in earnest. Rostopchin had left a small detachment of police, whom he charged with burning his house and the city to the ground, given that most buildings were made from wood. The city&#x27;s fire-engines were disassembled. Fuses were left throughout the city to ignite the fires. He left Moscow on 14 September 1812 and gave up his position as governor. Rostopchin owned two mansions in Moscow and an estate near Tarutino, Russia. Robert Wilson was with him, when Rostopchin set fire to his estate. According to Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace, Rostopchin was overwhelmed by events, and believed until the last moment that Moscow would not go down without a fight. These two quotations about the fire and the flight from Moscow can also be found in War and Peace:
Tolstoi also attributes the Fire of Moscow to the constitution of the city and not to Rostopchin:
In 1814 the Rostopchine family left Russia, going first to the Duchy of Warsaw, then to the German Confederation, Vienna, the Italian peninsula and finally in 1817 to France under the Bourbon Restoration. In Paris, he established a salon; his wife and daughter converted to Roman Catholicism. He claimed innocence against the charge of arson, and had a pamphlet printed and distributed in Paris proclaiming so in 1823, but subsequently admitted to his role in ordering the city&#x27;s destruction. He returned to Imperial Russia in 1825 and died in Moscow suffering from asthma and hemorrhoid complications. He was buried at the Pyatnitskoye Cemetery.

==Family==
He married Ekaterina Petrovna Protassova (1775–1869), and had eight children. Among them:
* Count Sergei Fyodorovich Rostopchin;
* Countess Natalya Fyodorovna Rostopchine;
* Countess Sofiya Fyodorovna Rostopchine, who married in 1819 and became a noted French novelist under the title of comtesse de Ségur;
* Countess Lise Fyodorovna Rostopchine;
* Count Andrei Fyodorovich Rostopchine, married Yevdokiya Petrovna Sushkova.

<doc id="1335473" wikidata="Q2662290" url="?curid=1335473" title="National Democratic Front of Boroland">
<text>The National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) was an armed separatist outfit which sought to obtain a sovereign Boroland for the Bodo people. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by the Government of India.

NDFB traces its origin to Bodo Security Force, a militant group formed in 1986. The current name was adopted in 1994, after the group rejected Bodo Accord signed between the Government of India and ABSU-BPAC. The group has carried out several attacks in Assam, targeting non-Bodo civilians as well as the security forces. In particular, it has targeted Santhal, Munda and Oraon adivasis (tribals), whose ancestors had been brought to Assam as tea labourers during British Raj. Its involvement in attacks on Adivasis during Bodo-Adivasi ethnic clash during the 1996 Assam Legislative Assembly elections led to the formation of Adivasi Cobra Force, a rival militant group. After 1996, NDFB was also involved in conflicts with the militant group Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (which surrendered in 2003). Since 2000, NDFB has increasingly targeted Bangladeshi migrants in what it claims to be the Boro territory.

During the 1990s, NDFB established 12 camps on the Bhutan-Assam border. After suffering major reverses during Royal Bhutan Army&#x27;s Operation All Clear, NDFB signed a ceasefire with the Indian authorities in May 2005.

This was followed by a split in the group: NDFB (P), the progressive faction supported peace talks with the government, while the faction led by Nabla opposed the talks. In 2012, following the arrest of their chairman, NDFB of Nabla faction split further, leading to the formation of another new faction, which was led by a non-Bodo I. K. Songbijit as an interim president of the interim council. This faction continued to indulge in militancy, and has been blamed by the government for May and December 2014 attacks.

The general assembly of the outfit held on 14 and 15 April 2015 vowed to revamp their national struggle and declared that the former interim national council of NDFB led by Songbijit is dissolved and a new national council was formed to fight for the liberation of sovereign, independent Boroland.

The NDFB signed a peace treaty with the government in 2020 and disbanded itself.

== Objectives ==

The main grievances of the group are the under-development in the region and the influx of immigrants. It aims to address these issues by seceding from India, and establishing a sovereign Boroland. The NDFB constitution, adopted on 10 March 1998, lists its objectives as the following:
* Liberate Boroland from the Indian expansionism and occupation;
* Free the Boro nation from the colonialist exploitation, oppression and domination;
* Establish a Democratic Socialist Society to promote Liberty, Equality and Fraternity; and
* Uphold the integrity and sovereignty of Boroland.

The promotion of the Roman script for the Bodo language is also a significant objective of NDFB and are against the use of Devanagari script for the language.

== History ==

The Bodos are an ethno-linguistic community native to the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam state of India. In the mid-1980s, Bodo politicians, alleging discrimination against Bodos in Assam, intensified their campaign for the creation of Bodo-majority Bodoland. While majority of the Bodos envisaged Bodoland as an autonomous territory or state within India, a small section demanded complete sovereignty. NDFB was formed by secessionist Bodos on 3 October 1986 as the Bodo Security Force (BdSF), under the leadership of Ranjan Daimary, in Odla Khasibari village (near Udalguri). BdSF carried out several violent attacks against non-Bodo civilians. On 12 December 1992, it attacked the 7th Assam Police Battalion headquarters at Choraikhola in Kokrajahar district, and decamped with 160 self-loading rifles (SLR) and 5 light machine guns (LMG).

The Bodoland movement was mainly led by the political organisations All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) and Bodo Peoples&#x27; Action Committee (BPAC). In 1993, these two groups signed the Bodo Accord with Indian government, agreeing to the formation of Bodoland Autonomous Council within Assam. BdSF opposed this Accord. Shortly after the Accord, the Assam State Government refused to hand over 2,750 villages to the proposed Council, arguing that Bodos formed less than 50% of the population in these villages. Following this, the BdSF was renamed to National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) on 25 November 1994. The NDFB then launched an ethnic cleansing campaign, attacking non-Bodo communities in these villages. During the 1996 Assam Legislative Assembly elections, it killed hundreds of Santhal, Munda and Oraon adivasis (tribals), whose ancestors had been brought to Assam as tea labourers during British Raj (1858 - 1947). In response, the tribals formed Adivasi Cobra Force, their own militant group.

In the mid-1990s, NDFB also faced a rival within the Bodo community, in form of Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (BLTF). The BLTF had evolved from an older militant group called the Bodo Volunteer Force. It considered NDFB&#x27;s secessionist agenda unrealistic and unattainable, and focused on establishment of an autonomous Bodo territory within India. After 1996, the two groups clashed violently for supremacy. BLTF allied with Bengali Tiger Force to protect Bengalis from NDFB attacks, and also supported Indian security forces against NDFB. The conflicts between Christian-dominated NDFB and Hindu-dominated BLTF polarised the Bodoland movement along religious lines. In 2003, BLTF surrendered en masse in return for the establishment of the Bodoland Territorial Council.

NDFB had established 12 camps on the Bhutan-Assam border. During 2003–2004, the Royal Bhutan Army destroyed these camps as part of its Operation All Clear. NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary was offered amnesty by the Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi in December 2003, but rejected the offer. On 8 October 2004, the NDFB announced a six-month-long unilateral ceasefire, that came into effect on 15 October. However, the Government continued its operations against the group. On 15 April 2005, NDFB extended the ceasefire. The Government released its general secretary Govinda Basumatary to open a channel of communication with the organisation&#x27;s Bangladesh-based leadership. This resulted in a ceasefire agreement between NDFB and the Government on 25 May 2005. The agreement stated that the NDFB agree to cease hostile action against security forces and civilians. In return, the security forces would not carry out operations against the group&#x27;s members. The agreement also stipulated that NDFB members would disarm and live in camps protected by the military for a year, and would refrain from assisting other militant groups. The pact came into force on 1 June 2005. However, certain factions of NDFB continued militancy. In May 2006, five members of the security forces were abducted and killed by suspected NDFB members in Assam&#x27;s Udalguri district. The group also continued to clash with cadres of the ex-BLTF (Bodo Liberation Tiger Force). On 5 June 2006, two former BLTF cadres were killed by NDFB militants in the Karbi Anglong district, and one former member of the disbanded group was lynched by suspected NDFB militants in Golaghat district on 3 June 2007.

In 2008, the group split into two after Ranjan Daimary&#x27;s name appeared in the 2008 Assam bombings case. NDFB (P), the pro-talks factions led by B Sungthagra supported peace talks with the governments. NDFB (R), led by Daimary, refused to give up militancy. In December 2008, the NDFB (P) indicated its plans to indirectly or directly participate the Lok Sabha elections. In 2012, I. K. Songbijit, the chief of the NDFB (R) faction&#x27;s &quot;Boroland Army&quot;, announced the formation of a nine-member &quot;interim national council&quot;, resulting in a split. NDFB (S), the faction led by Songbijit, is now the most dreaded faction. Amit Shah signed a historic peace treaty with factions on NDFB in February 2020.

==Splits==
After the Operation All Clear in 2003 the then united NDFB decided to go for ceasefire and talk to resolve the political issue in 2004. The proposal was submitted in 2008 and there was a meeting of the joint military council in Manipur. The secretary in the ministry of development of north east region, Naveen Verma, told the general secretary of the outfit that they must amend their proposition instead of negotiation at table or in other words they were forced to revise it, amend it and write a new memorandum.

There would have been no talks and extension of ceasefire unless the proposition was revised and amended which was submitted by the faction now known as National Democratic Front of Boroland - Progressive and the faction led by Ranjan Daimary who rejected it was then known as the Anti-Talks Faction, which further split into two factions.

== Leaders ==

=== National Council members ===

* President : B. Saoraigwra
* Vice-president : G. Bidai
* General Secretary : B.R. Ferrenga

==Equipment==

===Weapons===

NDFB have a sizeable number of sophisticated weapons including AK-series rifles. Since they have camps in Myanmar across Arunachal Pradesh, they have easy access to the latest weapons.

== Activities ==

NDFB has carried out bombings, kidnappings and murders in Assam. Due to armed conflict between NDFB and Adivasi Cobra Force, the NDFB have attacked Adivasi many times. The Assam Government has accused it of launching an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Oriya Adivasis and Bengali Muslim settlers in the region.

The group primarily operates in the region to the north and north-west of the Brahmaputra river. It is active in the Bongaigoan, Kokrajhar, Darrang, Barpeta, Barpeta, Nalbari and Sonitpur districts of Assam. It has also been active in the Garo Hills region of Meghalaya. It has used the neighbouring Bhutan as a refuge, crossing the border in the Manas National Park area. In December 2003, the Royal Bhutan Army initiated a crackdown on the group&#x27;s activities in Bhutan.

Between 1992 and 2001, the violence involving NDFB resulted in the deaths of 167 security forces personnel and over 1200 civilians:

=== Attacks attributed to NDFB ===

The attacks attributed to the NDFB include (SATP). Some incident don&#x27;t have evidence but NDFB is believed to be involved.

== Disbanding ==
NDFB disbanded itself at two locations in accordance with a clause in Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) signed by the four factions and the other stakeholders with the Indian Government on 27 January 2020. While disbanding, the NDFB (P) leader Gobinda Basumatry said &quot;To find a solution to political, economic, social and cultural issues of Bodo people, the Bodo Security Force was formed in 1986. It was renamed as NDFB in 1994. Our fight has finally come to an end after 34 years of armed struggle within and outside the country... from Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. We believe that the NDFB movement has been a successful one and so we are disbanding the group.&quot;

<text>Tracy Jamal Morgan (born November 10, 1968) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He was a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy television series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1996 to 2003, and played Tracy Jordan in the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; from 2006 to 2013, each of which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He also starred as Tray Barker in the TBS comedy &quot;The Last O.G.&quot;

==Early life==
Morgan was born on November 10, 1968, in Brooklyn and raised in Brooklyn&#x27;s Marlboro Houses and Tompkins Houses in its Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood. He is the second of five children of a homemaker, Alicia (née Warden), and James Morgan Jr IV, a musician who left the family when Morgan was six years old. He is the cousin of rapper Nas.

His father named him Tracy in honor of a platoon mate and friend who shipped off to Vietnam with him and was killed in action days later.

The target of bullies as a child, Morgan attended DeWitt Clinton High School. In 1985, at age 17 in his senior year, he learned that his father had contracted HIV from hypodermic needle use. His father died in January 1987, aged 38.

Morgan married his girlfriend Sabina that year and dropped out of high school just four credits short of his diploma to care for his ailing father. Living on welfare, Morgan sold crack cocaine with limited success, but began earning money performing comedy on the streets after his best friend was murdered. He said in 2009: &quot;He would say to me, &#x27;Yo, Tracy, man, you should be doing comedy.&#x27; A week later, he was murdered. And that for me, that was like my Vietnam. I had my survival guilt when I started to achieve success. Why I made it out and some guys didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Morgan embarked on a stand-up comedy career, successfully enough that he &quot;finally moved to a nice community in [The Bronx neighborhood of] Riverdale, from a run-down apartment next to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.&quot;

==Career==

Morgan made his screen debut playing Hustle Man on the television show &quot;Martin&quot;. The character sold various items from the &quot;hood&quot;, always greeting people with his trademark &quot;What&#x27;s happ&#x27;n, chief?,&quot; and had a pet dog he dressed as a rapper. (Later, in the 2003 Chris Rock film &quot;Head of State&quot;, Morgan appeared as a man watching television, often questioning why they are not watching &quot;Martin&quot;.)

Morgan was also a regular cast member on &quot;Uptown Comedy Club&quot;, a sketch-comedy show filmed in Harlem that aired for two seasons, from 1992 to 1994.

Morgan joined the cast of the comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1996, and performed as a regular until 2003. Producer Lorne Michaels chose him over Stephen Colbert in the final round of auditions. Morgan&#x27;s regular characters included the kindly but deluded vagrant Woodrow; outspoken apartment maintenance man Dominican Lou; lusty Astronaut Jones whose shorts skits ended with blunt sexual propositions towards beautiful extraterrestrial ladies; and &quot;Safari Planet&quot; host Brian Fellow who was enthusiastic but deeply ignorant about animals. Morgan&#x27;s celebrity impressions on &quot;SNL&quot; included Della Reese, Harry Belafonte, Maya Angelou and Little Richard. He returned to host on March 14, 2009, and reprised his roles as Brian Fellow and Astronaut Jones. He then made a guest appearance on the 2011 Christmas show, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, and hosted again on October 17, 2015.

Morgan had his own sitcom, &quot;The Tracy Morgan Show&quot;, in 2003, which was canceled after one season. Also in 2003, he was on an episode of &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; in which his car was towed from the valet parking.

From 2006 to 2013, Morgan was a cast member of the television series &quot;30 Rock&quot;. He played the character Tracy Jordan, a caricature of himself. His work on &quot;30 Rock&quot; was well-received, and he was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series at the 2009 Emmy Awards. He returned to the role in July 2020 for a reunion episode during the COVID-19 pandemic that was an upfront special for NBCUniversal.

In 2018, Morgan began starring in the TBS series &quot;The Last O.G.&quot; It ran for four seasons until 2021.


Morgan appeared in a stand-up special, &quot;One Mic&quot;, on Comedy Central. He also hosted the first Spike Guys&#x27; Choice Awards, which aired on June 13, 2007. He can be heard as Spoonie Luv on the Comedy Central program &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; and as Woof in the animated series &quot;Where My Dogs At?&quot;. He also was the voice of Luis in the animated film &quot;Rio&quot;.

Morgan acted in commercials for &quot;NFL 2K&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K&quot;, and &quot;NHL 2K&quot;, co-starring with Warren Sapp, Ben Wallace and Jeremy Roenick. He appeared in Adam Sandler&#x27;s film &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; as a transgender inmate.

In July 2019, he hosted the ESPYs in Los Angeles.

In 2022, the New York Friars Club bestowed the Entertainment Icon Award on Morgan at the club&#x27;s spring gala. Morgan is only the ninth recipient of the prestigious comedy award, and the first Black recipient.

==Influences==
Morgan has listed Carol Burnett, Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy, and Richard Pryor as among his primary comedic influences.

==Personal life==
===Family===
In 1987, while in high school, Morgan married his girlfriend Sabina. The pair have three sons together. Morgan filed for divorce in August 2009, after having been separated for approximately eight years. Morgan credits one of his sons with having saved him from his alcoholism. Of his extended family, Morgan said in 2009, &quot;I&#x27;m estranged from my own mother and most of my family, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s going to change much&quot;.

Morgan dated Tanisha Hall. She donated one of her kidneys to Morgan in December 2010.

In September 2011, on the red carpet at the Emmy Awards, Morgan announced he and model Megan Wollover had become engaged six months earlier in San Francisco. Their first child, a daughter, was born in New York City on July 2, 2013. Morgan and Wollover married on August 23, 2015. Morgan filed for divorce July 2020.

In 2023, on an episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Morgan discovered he is third cousins with American rapper Nas.

===Health problems===
In 1996, Morgan was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and for years has been an alcoholic. Morgan has conceded that many of his own troubles were incorporated within &quot;30 Rock&quot; episodes. In early December 2010, Morgan received a kidney transplant necessitated by his diabetes and alcohol use. Morgan admitted that he initially did not take his diabetes seriously but later realized the care for it would end up being a matter of life and death.

In August 2023, Morgan responded to a comment about his healthy appearance during an episode of &quot;Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot; by disclosing that he was using semaglutide. In March 2024, he told Jimmy Fallon that he had &quot;learned to out-eat Ozempic&quot; and &quot;gained 40 lbs,&quot; but later clarified that he was joking, saying &quot;Ozempic did great by me and I was glad to use it.&quot;

===Autobiography===
On October 20, 2009, Morgan&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I Am the New Black&quot;, was released. The book includes stories about living in Tompkins Projects in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, to becoming a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Morgan appeared on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot; hosted by Terry Gross, at times becoming very emotional about his former life in a New York ghetto.

===2014 traffic collision and lawsuit===
On June 7, 2014, Morgan was a passenger in a Mercedes Sprinter minibus involved in a six-vehicle crash in New Jersey. Just after 1:00 am the vehicle was traveling northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike near Cranbury, when it was struck from behind by a Walmart tractor-trailer, causing a chain reaction crash. Morgan and three other comedians, including Harris Stanton, along with Morgan&#x27;s assistant and two limousine company employees, were returning from an engagement at Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino in Dover, Delaware, as part of Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Turn it Funny&quot; stand-up comedy tour. The crash killed Morgan&#x27;s friend and collaborator, 62-year-old comedian James McNair (Jimmy Mack).

Morgan was taken by helicopter to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with a broken femur, broken nose, a traumatic brain injury, and several broken ribs, and underwent surgery on his leg on June 8. On June 20, 2014, Morgan was released from the hospital and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility to continue recovering from the injuries sustained during the crash. He was released from the rehab center on July 12, 2014.

The driver of the Walmart transport-truck, Kevin Roper of Jonesboro, Georgia, pleaded not guilty to one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. The complaint alleges Roper dozed off and hit Morgan&#x27;s limousine after swerving to avoid slowed traffic ahead of him. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that Roper had been on the clock since 11:20 the previous morning and was very close to the federal limits of 14 hours per day and 11 hours behind the wheel.

On July 10, 2014, Morgan sued Walmart for negligence. The suit alleged that Walmart either knew or should have known that Roper had not slept for more than 24 hours. The complaint alleged that before his shift, Walmart forced Roper to drive from his home in Jonesboro to a Walmart distribution center in Smyrna, Delaware—a distance of some over 11 hours—even though there were several other distribution centers within a much more reasonable driving distance. Morgan filed the suit on behalf of himself, comedian Ardie Fuqua, Morgan&#x27;s personal assistant Jeffrey Millea, and Millea&#x27;s wife Krista. Fuqua and Millea were both on the bus with Morgan and injured in the crash, while at the time of the crash, Krista Millea was eight months pregnant, and the suit charges that she suffered loss of consortium due to the injuries suffered by her husband. In September 2014, Walmart in court papers cast partial blame on Morgan and the other victims for not wearing seat belts, a claim both Morgan and his counsel denied, noting that the driver who caused the crash had been charged with vehicular homicide and that the police report stated that seat belts were not an issue in the case.

By October 2014, the actor was still undergoing rehab and required a wheelchair when taking more than &quot;some steps.&quot; On May 27, 2015, Walmart settled the lawsuit for a multi-million-dollar amount. It is estimated that the sum settled for was approximately $90 million US.

On June 1, 2015, Morgan made his first public appearance since the crash, in an interview with Matt Lauer on &quot;Today&quot;. In that interview, he appeared lucid but said that &quot;I have my good days and my bad days, where I forgot things,&quot; and that he also gets recurring headaches. He also stated that he had no memory of the crash. Morgan made a surprise appearance at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 20, and was greeted with a standing ovation. He then hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 17, 2015. On the November 3, 2016 episode of &quot;Conan&quot;, Morgan said that he was no longer angry about the collision and had forgiven Roper. The driver of the Walmart truck, Roper, accepted a plea deal in which he pleaded guilty but would serve no jail time. Roper was sentenced to pay undisclosed amounts of fines, serve 300 hours of community service, and serve probation. Morgan&#x27;s 2017 Netflix standup special &quot;Staying Alive&quot; joked about Walmart and the lawsuit, while detailing his hospitalization, rehab and recovery.

==Controversies==

During a performance in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 3, 2011, Morgan made remarks about homosexuals, reportedly stating that if his son were gay, his son better speak to him like a man or he would &quot;pull out a knife and stab him.&quot; Morgan apologized, saying that he had &quot;gone too far.&quot; NBC Entertainment head Bob Greenblatt stated, &quot;I speak for NBC and myself personally when I say we do not condone hate or violence of any kind, and I am pleased to see Tracy Morgan apologizing for recent homophobic remarks in his standup appearance... Unfortunately, Tracy&#x27;s comments reflect negatively on both &quot;30 Rock&quot; and NBC – two very all-inclusive and diverse organizations – and we have made it clear to him that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated.&quot; Tina Fey, Morgan&#x27;s boss both in fiction and in real life, said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad to hear that Tracy apologized ... but the violent imagery of Tracy&#x27;s rant was disturbing to me at a time when homophobic hate crimes continue to be a life-threatening issue for the LGBT community...the Tracy Morgan I know, ...is not a hateful man and [would never] hurt another person. I hope for his sake that Tracy&#x27;s apology will be accepted as sincere by his gay and lesbian co-workers at &quot;30 Rock&quot;, without whom Tracy would not have lines to say, clothes to wear, sets to stand on, scene partners to act with or a printed-out paycheck from accounting to put in his pocket.&quot;

In 2012, Morgan&#x27;s mother, Alicia Warden, said her Youngstown, Ohio, home was on the verge of foreclosure as a result of being laid off from her job the previous year. Her home value at the time was estimated to be $28,000, and her request for help from Morgan resulted in an offer of a one-time gift of $2,000, which she refused. Morgan responded in a statement: &quot;I am saddened that these untrue stories about me have people questioning my commitment to my family. For reasons that are between us, I have not seen my mother in 11 years and outside of a random call here and there have had little to no contact with my sister. We all have personal family issues that we have to deal with in life, but I choose to deal with mine in private and not through the media.&quot; Warden also reportedly attempted to visit Morgan in the hospital shortly after his 2014 traffic accident, but was turned away by hospital security and Wollover (who became his wife in 2015). She said she returned the following day and was allowed five minutes with Morgan, who was still comatose at the time.

In June 2019, Morgan was involved in a minor collision in his newly purchased Bugatti Veyron, and he was captured on video tapping on the other driver&#x27;s window and yelling, &quot;Bitch, get out of the car&quot;. According to &quot;Mercury News&quot;, the other driver was traumatized by Morgan&#x27;s conduct. A CBS News reporter visited Morgan to get his side of the story and Morgan allowed the reporter through his gate, answered the door himself, but refused to talk.

<text>Analog Pussy () is a psychedelic trance group that originated in Israel, now located in Germany.

==History==
Jiga was born in Jerusalem. At age 15 she learned to play a bass guitar and played in punk bands. She bought a $50 synthesizer and a computer and began producing on her own.
Jinno was born in Montevideo, Uruguay and moved to Israel in his early childhood. In his teens he experimented with electronic music when he connected several synthesizers together.
The two met when Jiga broke away from the punk/metal genre and was interested in electronic music
and in 1997 formed Analog Pussy together.

==Career==
Jiga and Jinno built a studio in their living room where they produced their first tracks. 
They made their music available for free on the internet and gained a fan-base. Later on, when they headlined the Electronic charts on MP3.com, their music was downloaded over one million times.

In 1999, coming back from their first European tour, they signed with the German label Balloonia Records and released their first album, &quot;Psycho Bitch From Hell&quot;.

Jiga and Jinno relocated to Germany in 2002
and launched their own record label &quot;AP Records&quot;, whose first release was their second album, &quot;Underground&quot;.

In mid 2004 they released their third album &quot;Trance &#x27;N Roll&quot;. The songs feature live instruments, hard rock guitar riffs and vocals.

The instrument most associated with Analog Pussy is a yellow bass guitar by BassLab, played by Jiga.

==Breakup==
The duo broke up their personal and musical relationship in 2007.
Jiga continues to play live and release new music as Analog Pussy.

<doc id="1335480" wikidata="Q1109250" url="?curid=1335480" title="ReWire (software protocol)">
<text>ReWire is a software protocol, jointly developed by Propellerhead and Steinberg, allowing remote control and data transfer among digital audio editing and related software. Originally appearing in the ReBirth software synthesizer in 1998, the protocol has since evolved into an industry standard.

Reason Studios has announced that they have discontinued ReWire as of version 11 of Reason.

Currently used in macOS and Microsoft Windows 32-bit or 64-bit audio applications, ReWire enables the simultaneous transfer of up to 256 audio tracks of arbitrary resolution and 4080 channels of MIDI data. This allows, for example, the output from synthesizer software to be fed directly into a linear editor without the use of intermediate files or analog transfers. There are also provisions to remotely trigger actions, such as starting and stopping recording. The protocol is licensed free of charge to companies only, but comes with a &quot;non-disclosure of source code&quot; license that is incompatible with most free-software licenses.

The ReWire system consists of &quot;Hosts&quot;, &quot;Panels&quot;, and &quot;Devices&quot;. Hosts are the host applications which typically do the sequencing at one end and the final mixdown at the other end. A Device is a dynamic link library that only generates sound; it has no user interface. A Panel is a graphical interface for setting the parameters of one Device. A typical setup would be to use Ableton Live in &quot;Host&quot; mode, and use Propellerhead Reason as a synthesizer. In this case Reason would provide Device/Panel pairs to Ableton, which could then send MIDI commands, sync timing and mix Reason&#x27;s output into its own effects chains. Many applications support either mode. In fact, an application could (at the discretion of a developer) act as both a Host and a Panel at the same time.

<text>Martin Joseph O&#x27;Malley (born 22 February 1939) is a Canadian journalist and writer. He has written for CBC News and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. O&#x27;Malley is perhaps best known for a Globe and Mail column in which he coined the line about laws that criminalized homosexual behavior
that Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau later made famous: &quot;There&#x27;s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.&quot;

O&#x27;Malley was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, moving to Toronto to pursue his career as a newspaper reporter and columnist.

He has written the following books:
* &quot;The Past and Future Land: an account of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry&quot;
* &quot;Doctors&quot;
* &quot;Hospital&quot;
* &quot;Gross Misconduct: The Life of Spinner Spencer&quot;
* &quot;Running Risks&quot;
* &quot;Game Day: the Blue Jays at SkyDome&quot;
* &quot;More than Meets the Eye: Watching television watching us&quot;

&quot;Gross Misconduct&quot; earned O&#x27;Malley the Author of the Year award in 1989 from the Foundation for the Advancement of Canadian Letters. The book was made into a TV film, directed by Atom Egoyan. O&#x27;Malley also wrote the CBC docudrama &quot;Giant Mine&quot;.

<doc id="1335484" wikidata="Q839127" url="?curid=1335484" title="Marquette Interchange">
<text>The Marquette Interchange is a major freeway interchange in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, located near Marquette University where Interstate 43 (I-43, North–South Freeway), I-94 (North–South Freeway and East–West Freeway), and I-794 (Lake Freeway) meet. Originally built in the 1960s, the interchange underwent a total rebuild between 2004 and 2008, and was officially opened on August 19, 2008, after what was at the time the largest construction project in state history. During the early 2000s, U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) had followed I-94 through the interchange. This had changed when I-41 was designated in the Milwaukee area. US 41 now follows I-41 through the Zoo Interchange instead.

== History ==
The history of the Marquette Interchange, originally called the Central Interchange, stretches back more than half a century. The idea of a north–south freeway with an interchange in downtown Milwaukee was first proposed in 1952 for an area south and east of Marquette University. An artist&#x27;s sketch in a local newspaper in October 1952 provided a first glimpse of the future.

The following year, the Milwaukee County Expressway Commission was created by state law to plan, design, construct and maintain a freeway system in Milwaukee County. Land acquisition soon began. In 1955, the Milwaukee County Board adopted &quot;A General Plan of Expressways for Milwaukee County&quot;, which included a downtown interchange near the present location of the Marquette Interchange.

All of this activity in Milwaukee was in no way unique. Many cities across the United States were drawing up plans for new freeways during the mid-1950s. Nationally, there were big plans, too. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, creating the United States&#x27; modern Interstate Highway System.

Preliminary design on the Marquette Interchange began in 1956, and final design began in 1960. In 1964, construction began, and so did a difficult balancing act. For the next years, traffic flow on city streets had to be maintained while new expressways and the new interchange were built in their midst. Bypasses and temporary street connections were used extensively to route heavy volumes of traffic around construction areas. Between 1964 and 1968, 21 construction contracts totaling over $33 million were awarded. The Marquette Interchange was dedicated and opened to traffic on December 23, 1968.

The interchange was, and still is in its rebuilt form, one of downtown Milwaukee&#x27;s most prominent features. The Marquette Interchange has no affiliation with Marquette University, to which it is adjacent. Marquette University officials like to joke about how the university receives complaints from disgruntled motorists who erroneously believe the interchange is owned by the university.

By the 2000s, the interchange was experiencing severe deterioration and traffic problems due to major design flaws, including poorly designed left exits and vehicles having to weave across travel lanes to reach exit ramps, causing accidents and bottlenecks.

=== The new interchange ===

The junction underwent a complete reconstruction dubbed the Marquette Interchange Project between 2004 and 2008, and was officially opened on August 19, 2008, several weeks ahead of schedule. The construction came in at $190 million below its $1 billion budget. The project involved 46 cranes and more than 4,000 workers in what was at the time the largest construction project in state history.

The project rebuilt the viaduct section of I-794 between the interchange and the Milwaukee River, I-43 from the interchange to North Avenue (including the bridges carrying city streets that spanned the freeway), the Hillside Interchange that connected I-43 to Highway 145, and I-94 from the interchange to 26th Street (including rebuilding the north end of the 16th Street Viaduct, officially known as the James E. Groppi Unity Bridge). The project also demolished the Milwaukee County Courthouse Annex parking structure that stood over the northbound lanes of I-43 just north of the interchange. The interchange reconstruction also re-configured the stubbed Park Freeway to an arterial street design, with the freed up land eventually leading to the redevelopment of the Haymarket neighborhood, and the construction of the Fiserv Forum arena.

The new Marquette Interchange occupies the same approximately 75 acres of downtown land as the old interchange system, with some adjustments. Design features include:

* Two lane ramps in all directions
* More gradual curves on ramps, with longer sight distances
* More distance between ramps, to eliminate traffic conflicts from lane changes, which was accommodated by rebuilding the roads a half-mile from the interchange
* Elimination of all left-hand entrances and exits
* Design features allow for future expansion in all directions to eight lanes

<text>The Burning of Washington, also known as the Capture of Washington, was a successful British amphibious attack conducted by Rear-Admiral George Cockburn during Admiral John Warren&#x27;s Chesapeake campaign. It was the only time since the American Revolutionary War that a foreign power had captured and occupied a United States capital. Following the defeat of American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, a British army led by Major-General Robert Ross marched on Washington, D.C. That evening, British soldiers and sailors set fire to multiple public buildings, including the Presidential Mansion, United States Capitol, and Washington Navy Yard.

The attack was in part a retaliation for prior American actions in British-held Upper Canada, in which U.S. forces had burned and looted York the previous year and had then burned large portions of Port Dover. Less than four days after the attack began, a heavy thunderstorm, possibly a hurricane and a tornado, extinguished the fires and caused further destruction. The British occupation of Washington, D.C. lasted for roughly 26 hours.

President James Madison, along with his administration and several military officials, evacuated and were able to find refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland; Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley&#x27;s house, known today as the Madison House, still exists.

== Background ==
The United Kingdom was already at war with France when the United States declared war in 1812. The war against France took up most of Britain&#x27;s attention and military resources. The initial British strategy against the United States focused on imposing a naval blockade at sea, and maintaining a defensive stance on land. The British Army could not reinforce Canada; instead, the government relied on militia units and indigenous allies to support the British Army units already posted in Canada. With the defeat and exile of Napoleon in April 1814, Britain was able to use its newly available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. The Earl of Bathurst, serving as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to the imperial fortress of Bermuda, from where a blockade of the U.S. coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada.

The commanders were under strict orders not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory. Early in 1814, Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy&#x27;s North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard, which were used to blockade American ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States, by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans. Rear-Admiral George Cockburn had commanded the squadron in Chesapeake Bay since the previous year. On June 25, he wrote to Cochrane stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack.

Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Rear Admiral Cockburn accurately predicted that &quot;within a short period of time, with enough force, we could easily have at our mercy the capital&quot;.

He recommended Washington, D.C. as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and &quot;the greater political effect likely to result&quot;. On July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn to &quot;deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages ... You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable&quot;. Cochrane further instructed, &quot;You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States&quot;. Ross was less optimistic. He &quot;never dreamt for one minute that an army of 3,500 men with 1,000 marines reinforcement, with no cavalry, hardly any artillery, could march 50 miles inland and capture an enemy capital&quot;, according to historian John McCavitt. Ross refused to accept Cockburn&#x27;s recommendation to burn the entire city. He spared nearly all of the privately owned properties.

An added motive was retaliation for the &quot;wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie&quot; by American troops under Colonel John Campbell in May, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover. On June 2, Sir George Prevost, Governor General of British North America, wrote to Cochrane at Admiralty House, in Bailey&#x27;s Bay, Bermuda, calling for a retaliation against the American destruction of private property in violation of the laws of war. Prévost argued that,

in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.

Many sources also suggest that the attack on Washington was motivated by revenge for the American looting of York in Upper Canada, the provincial capital, after the Battle of York in April 1813. Earlier, the British had filed general complaints about the &quot;wanton destruction&quot; along the Niagara region and Lake Erie. Major General Ross commanded the 4,500-man army in Washington, composed of the 1st Battalion, the 4th (King&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot, the 21st (Royal North British Fusilier) Regiment of Foot, the 1st Battalion, the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot, the 85th Regiment of Foot and a battalion of Royal Marines. This force defeated an American army at the Battle of Bladensburg.

== Burning ==
President James Madison, members of his government, and the military fled the city in the wake of the British victory at Bladensburg. They found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the &quot;United States&#x27; Capital for a Day&quot;. President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked as a silversmith in Brookeville. Bentley&#x27;s house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.

On August 24, 1814, the British, led by Ross and Cockburn, entered Washington with a force of 4,500 &quot;battle hardened&quot; men. The plan to attack Washington had been formulated by Rear Admiral Cockburn, who predicted that &quot;within a short period of time, with enough force, we could easily have at our mercy the capital&quot;. Ross commanded the troops and was less optimistic. While Cockburn recommended burning the entire city, Ross planned to damage only public buildings.

Ross, who was described by historian John McCavitt as &quot;an officer and a gentleman&quot;, initially planned for an orderly surrender of Washington. However, as he and his men entered the city under a flag of truce, American soldiers remaining in the city &quot;treacherously&quot; opened fire, wounding Ross&#x27; horse and killing two of his men. McCavitt argued that this led him to &quot;reluctantly&quot; order the burning of the White House and the Capitol building.

=== U.S. Capitol ===
The United States Capitol was, according to some contemporary travelers, the only building in Washington &quot;worthy to be noticed&quot;. Thus, it was a prime target for the British, for both its aesthetic and its symbolic value. Upon arrival into the city via Maryland Avenue, the British targeted the Capitol, first the southern wing, containing the House of Representatives, then the northern wing, containing the Senate. Prior to setting it aflame, the British sacked the building, which at that time housed Congress, the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court.

Items looted by troops led by Rear Admiral Cockburn included a ledger entitled &quot;An account of the receipts and expenditures of the United States for the year 1810&quot;; the admiral wrote on the inside leaf that it was &quot;taken in President&#x27;s room in the Capitol, at the destruction of that building by the British, on the capture of Washington, 24th August, 1814&quot;. He later gave it to his elder brother Sir James Cockburn, the Governor of Bermuda. The book was returned to the Library of Congress in 1940.

The British intended to burn the building to the ground. They set fire to the southern wing first. The flames grew so quickly that the British were prevented from collecting enough wood to burn the stone walls completely. However, the Library of Congress&#x27;s contents in the northern wing contributed to the flames on that side. Among the items destroyed was the 3,000-volume collection of the Library of Congress and the intricate decorations of the neoclassical columns, pediments, and sculptures designed by William Thornton in 1793 and Benjamin Latrobe in 1803.

The wooden ceilings and floors burned and the glass skylights melted from the intense heat. The building was not a complete loss. The House rotunda, the east lobby, the staircases, and Latrobe&#x27;s famous Corn-Cob Columns in the Senate entrance hall all survived. The Superintendent of the Public Buildings of the City of Washington, Thomas Munroe, concluded that the loss to the Capitol amounted to $787,163.28 (), with $457,388.36 () for the north wing and main building, and $329,774.92 () for the south wing.

=== White House ===

After burning the Capitol, the British turned northwest up Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House. After U.S. government officials and President Madison fled the city, First Lady Dolley Madison received a letter from her husband, urging her to be prepared to leave Washington at a moment&#x27;s notice. Dolley organized the enslaved and other staff to save valuables from the British. James Madison&#x27;s personal enslaved attendant, the fifteen-year-old boy Paul Jennings, was an eyewitness. After later buying his freedom from the widow Dolley Madison, Jennings published his memoir in 1865, considered the first from the White House:

Jennings said the people who saved the painting and removed the objects actually were:

The sappers and miners of the Corps of Royal Engineers under Captain Blanshard, who were employed in burning the government buildings, entered the White House. Blanshard reported that it seemed that Madison was so sure that the attacking force would be made prisoners of war that a handsome feast had been prepared. Blanshard and his sappers enjoyed it. The soldiers then burned the president&#x27;s house, and fuel was added to the fires that night to ensure they would continue burning into the next day.

=== Other Washington buildings ===
The day after the destruction of the White House, Rear Admiral Cockburn entered the building of the D.C. newspaper, the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot;, intending to burn it down. However, several women persuaded him not to because they were afraid the fire would spread to their neighboring houses. Cockburn wanted to destroy the newspaper because its reporters had written so negatively about him, branding him the &quot;Ruffian&quot;. Instead, he ordered his troops to tear the building down brick by brick, and ordered all the &quot;C&quot; type destroyed &quot;so that the rascals can have no further means of abusing my name&quot;.

The British sought out the United States Treasury in hopes of finding money or items of worth, but they found only old records. They burned the United States Treasury and other public buildings. The United States Department of War building was also burned. However, the War and State Department files had been removed, so the books and records had been saved; the only records of the War Department lost were recommendations of appointments for the Army and letters received from seven years earlier. The First U.S. Patent Office Building was saved by the efforts of William Thornton, the former architect of the Capitol and then the superintendent of patents, who gained British cooperation to preserve it. &quot;When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building ... left untouched&quot; in Washington.

The Americans had already burned much of the historic Washington Navy Yard, founded by Thomas Jefferson, to prevent capture of stores and ammunition, as well as the 44-gun frigate USS &quot;Columbia&quot; and the 22-gun USS &quot;Argus&quot;, both new vessels nearing completion. The Navy Yard&#x27;s Latrobe Gate, Quarters A, and Quarters B were the only buildings to escape destruction. Also spared were the Marine Barracks and Commandant&#x27;s House, although several private properties were damaged or destroyed. In the afternoon of August 25, General Ross sent two hundred men to secure a fort on Greenleaf&#x27;s Point. The fort, later known as Fort McNair, had already been destroyed by the Americans, but 150 barrels of gunpowder remained. While the British were trying to dispose of them by dropping them into a well, the powder ignited. As many as thirty British soldiers were killed in the explosion, with several others injured.

==&quot;The Storm that Saved Washington&quot;==

Less than four days after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstorm—possibly a hurricane—put out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away and killing British troops and American civilians alike. Following the storm, the British troops returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. There is some debate regarding the effect of this storm on the occupation. While some assert that the storm forced the British to retreat, historians have argued that their intention was only to destroy the city&#x27;s government buildings, rather than occupy it for an extended period. It is also clear that Ross never intended to damage private buildings as had been recommended by Cockburn and Cochrane.

Whatever the case, the British occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. Despite this, the &quot;Storm that saved Washington&quot;, as it became known, did the opposite according to some. The rains sizzled and cracked the already charred walls of the White House and ripped away at structures the British had no plans to destroy (such as the Patent Office). The storm may have exacerbated an already dire situation for Washington D.C. An encounter was noted between Sir George Cockburn and a female resident of Washington. &quot;Dear God! Is this the weather to which you are accustomed in this infernal country?&quot; enquired the Admiral. &quot;This is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city&quot;, the woman allegedly called out to Cockburn. &quot;Not so, Madam&quot;, Cockburn retorted. &quot;It is rather to aid your enemies in the destruction of your city&quot;, before riding off on horseback.

The Royal Navy reported that it lost one man killed and six wounded in the attack, of whom the fatality and three of the wounded were from the 6th West India Regiment of the Corps of Colonial Marines. The destruction of the Capitol, including the Senate House and the House of Representatives, the Arsenal, Dockyard, Treasury, War Office, President&#x27;s mansion, bridge over the Potomac, a frigate and a sloop together with all materiel was estimated at £365,000 (). A separate British force captured Alexandria, Virginia, on the south side of the Potomac River, while Ross&#x27;s troops were leaving Washington. The mayor of Alexandria made a deal and the British refrained from burning the town. In 2013, an episode of the Weather Channel documentary series &quot;When Weather Changed History&quot;, entitled &quot;The Thunderstorm That Saved D.C.&quot;, was devoted to these events.

== Aftermath ==
President Madison and the military officers returned to Washington by September 1, on which date Madison issued a proclamation calling on citizens to defend the District of Columbia. Congress did not return for three and a half weeks. When they did so, they assembled in special session on September 19 in the Post and Patent Office building at Blodgett&#x27;s Hotel, one of the few buildings large enough to hold all members to be spared. Congress met in this building until December 1815, when construction of the Old Brick Capitol was complete.

Most contemporary American observers, including newspapers representing anti-war Federalists, condemned the destruction of the public buildings as needless vandalism. Many in the British public were shocked by the burning of the Capitol and other buildings at Washington. Such actions were denounced by most leaders of continental Europe, where capital cities had been repeatedly occupied in the course of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars but always spared destruction, at least on the part of the occupiers—the famous burning of Moscow that occurred less than two years prior had been an act carried out by the defenders. According to &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, the burning had &quot;brought a heavy censure on the British character&quot;, with some members of Parliament, including the anti-establishment MP Samuel Whitbread, joining in the criticism, declaring that the government was &quot;making much of the taking of a few buildings in a non-strategic swamp, as though it had captured Paris&quot;.

In contrast, the majority of British public opinion perceived the burnings to be justified following the damage that the U.S. military had inflicted during its incursions into Canada. The British public also pointed to the United States&#x27;s role in initiating the war, viewing this as an act of aggression. Several commentators regarded the damages as just revenge for the American destruction of the Parliament buildings and other public buildings in York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, early in 1813. Sir George Prévost wrote that &quot;as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate&quot;. The Reverend John Strachan, who as Rector of York had witnessed the American acts there, wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington &quot;was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada&quot;. When they ultimately returned to Bermuda, the British forces took with them two pairs of portraits of King George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, which had been discovered in one of the public buildings. One pair currently hangs in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda, and the other in the Cabinet Building, both in the city of Hamilton.

== Reconstruction ==
There was a movement in Congress to relocate the capital after the burning. Congressmen from the north pushed for relocation to Philadelphia or some other prominent northern city, while Southern congressmen claimed that moving the capital would degrade the American sense of dignity and strength (however, many Southern congressmen simply did not want to move the capital north of the Mason–Dixon line). On September 21, the House of Representatives voted to strike down a proposal to relocate the capital from Washington, D.C. by a margin of 83 to 54.

On February 3, 1815, in an effort to guarantee that the federal government would always remain in the area, Washington property owners funded the building of the Old Brick Capitol, a larger meeting space where the Supreme Court now stands. Construction of the Old Brick Capitol cost $25,000 () and was funded primarily through the sale of stocks. The largest donor was Daniel Carroll of Duddington, a rich English property owner in the area. Construction began on July 4, and concluded in December. Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol between December 1815 and December 1819, when the Capitol reopened.

The Capitol reconstruction took much longer than anticipated. The Old Brick Capitol took only five months to complete, but the Capitol took twelve years. A committee appointed by Congress to investigate the damage to the district concluded that it was cheaper to rebuild the already existing and damaged buildings than to build an entirely new one. On February 13, President Madison and Congress passed legislation to borrow $500,000 to repair the public buildings, including the Capitol, &quot;on their present sites in the city of Washington&quot;. Benjamin Latrobe, architect of the Capitol who took over for William Thornton in 1803, was rehired to repair the building on April 18. He immediately requested 60,000 feet (18,288 m) of boards, 500 tons of stone, 1,000 barrels of lime, and brick.

With the $500,000 borrowed from Washington banks, Latrobe was able to rebuild the two wings and the central dome before being fired in 1817 over budgetary conflicts. Charles Bulfinch took over and completed the renovations by 1826. Bulfinch modified Latrobe&#x27;s design by increasing the height of the Capitol dome to match the diameter of 86 ft (26.2 m). With the reconstruction of the public buildings in Washington, the value of land in the area increased dramatically, paving the way for the expansion of the city that developed in the years leading up to the American Civil War.

==Legacy==
In 2009, President Barack Obama held a ceremony at the White House to honor the Madisons&#x27; slave Paul Jennings as a representative of staff action to save the Gilbert Stuart painting and other valuables. (The painting that was saved was a copy Stuart made of the painting, not the original, although it is the same one on display in the East Room.) &quot;A dozen descendants of Jennings came to Washington, to visit the White House. They looked at the painting their relative helped save.&quot; In an interview with National Public Radio, Jennings&#x27; great-great-grandson, Hugh Alexander, said, &quot;We were able to take a family portrait in front of the painting, which was for me one of the high points.&quot; He confirmed that Jennings later purchased his freedom from the widowed Dolley Madison.

During heated free trade negotiations in 2018, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked President Donald Trump how the United States could justify protective tariffs as a national security issue. Trump retorted, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you guys burn down the White House?&quot;

== In literature ==
Lydia Sigourney reflects on this event in her poem &quot;&quot;, written under her maiden name, Lydia Huntley, in her first collection of poetry of 1815. Bob Dylan references this event in his song &quot;Narrow Way&quot;. Corb Lund references this event in his song &quot;Horse Soldier, Horse Soldier&quot;.

<text>Canada Bay is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of City of Canada Bay.

Canada Bay is also a bay on Parramatta River between Concord and Five Dock. The suburb of Canada Bay sits on the southern shore and is bordered by the suburbs of Burwood, Croydon and Five Dock. The City of Canada Bay takes its name from the bay but its administrative centre is located in the suburb of Drummoyne.

== History ==

The name Canada Bay honours a link between Australia and Canada. Following the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 to 1838, two Irish and 58 French Canadian rebels were deported to Australia. At the request of the local Catholic bishop, they were brought to Sydney. Imprisoned at Longbottom Stockade (which was located at what is now Concord Oval), the convicts broke stone for the construction of Parramatta Road and collected oyster shells for making lime. In 1842, the French Canadians were allowed to work outside the prison. Between 1843 and 1844, all received pardons and, except for two people who died and one (Joseph Marceau) who settled in Dapto, all returned to Canada.

After the rebellions, John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, Governor General and Lord High Commissioner to British North America recommended that Britain grant responsible self-government to the Union of Upper and Lower Canada. Many parts of Canada Bay are a reminder of this history: Exile Bay, France Bay, Durham Street, Marceau Drive, Polding Street and Gipps Street. Bayview Park has a plaque that honours the exiles and marks the point of disembarkation.

The City of Canada Bay was formed in December 2000 by the merger of Concord and Drummoyne councils.

==Demographics==

<text>Joseph Hormayr, Baron zu Hortenburg (, also known as &quot;Joseph Freiherr von Hormayr zu Hortenburg&quot;) (20 January 1781 – 5 November 1848) was an Austrian and German statesman and historian.

== Biography ==
Hormayr was born at Innsbruck. After studying law in his native town, and attaining the rank of captain in the Tirolese Landwehr, the young man, who had the advantage of being the grandson of Joseph von Hormayr (1705–1778), chancellor of Tirol, obtained a post in the foreign office at Vienna (1801), from which he rose in 1803 to be court secretary and, being a near friend of the Archduke Johann of Austria, director of the secret archives of the state and court for thirteen months. In 1803 he married Theresia von Hohenwald.

During the insurrection of 1809, by which the Tirolese sought to throw off the Bavarian supremacy confirmed by the treaty of Pressburg, Hormayr was the mainstay of the Austrian party, and assumed the administration of everything (especially the composition of proclamations and pamphlets); but, returning home without the prestige of success, he fell, in spite of the help of the Archduke John, into disfavour both with the emperor Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and with Prince Metternich, and at length, when in 1813 he tried to stir up a new insurrection in Tirol, he was arrested and imprisoned at Mukachevo.

In 1816, some amends were made to him by his appointment as imperial historiographer; but so little was he satisfied with the general policy and conduct of the Austrian court that in 1828 he accepted an invitation of King Louis I to the Bavarian capital, where he became ministerial councilor in the department of foreign affairs.

In 1832 he was appointed Bavarian minister-resident at Hanover, and from 1837 to 1846 he held the same position at Bremen. Together with Count Johann Friedrich von der Decken (1769–1840) he founded the Historical Society of Lower Saxony (Historischer Verein für Niedersachsen). The last two years of his life were spent at Munich as superintendent of the national archives.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1820.

He died in October 1848 of unknown causes, aged 67, in Munich.

==Posthumous assessment==
Hormayr&#x27;s literary activity was closely conditioned by the circumstances of his political career and by the fact that Johannes von Müller (died 1811) was his teacher: while his access to original documents gave value to his treatment of the past, his record or criticism of contemporary events received authority and interest from his personal experience. But his history of the Tirolese rebellion is far from being impartial; for he always liked to put himself into the first place, and the merits of Andreas Hofer and of other leaders are not sufficiently acknowledged. In his later writings he appears as a keen opponent of the policy of the court of Vienna.

The following are among Hormayr&#x27;s more important works:

<text>The lambda point is the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) makes the transition to superfluid state (helium II). At pressure of 1 atmosphere, the transition occurs at approximately 2.17 K. The lowest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the vapor−He-I−He-II triple point at and , which is the &quot;saturated vapor pressure&quot; at that temperature (pure helium gas in thermal equilibrium over the liquid surface, in a hermetic container). The highest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the bcc−He-I−He-II triple point with a helium solid at , .

The point&#x27;s name derives from the graph (pictured) that results from plotting the specific heat capacity as a function of temperature (for a given pressure in the above range, in the example shown, at 1 atmosphere), which resembles the Greek letter lambda formula_1. The specific heat capacity has a sharp peak as the temperature approaches the lambda point. The tip of the peak is so sharp that a critical exponent characterizing the divergence of the heat capacity can be measured precisely only in zero gravity, to provide a uniform density over a substantial volume of fluid. Hence, the heat capacity was measured within 2 nK below the transition in an experiment included in a Space Shuttle payload in 1992.

Although the heat capacity has a peak, it does not tend towards infinity (contrary to what the graph may suggest), but has finite limiting values when approaching the transition from above and below. The behavior of the heat capacity near the peak is described by the formula formula_2 where formula_3 is the reduced temperature, formula_4 is the Lambda point temperature, formula_5 are constants (different above and below the transition temperature), and is the critical exponent: formula_6. Since this exponent is negative for the superfluid transition, specific heat remains finite.

The quoted experimental value of is in a significant disagreement with the most precise theoretical determinations coming from high temperature expansion techniques, Monte Carlo methods and the conformal bootstrap.

<text>Rentrak Corporation is a global media measurement and research company serving the entertainment industry. Rentrak is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, US, with additional offices in the United States and around the world.

In February 2016, comScore completed its acquisition of Rentrak in an all-stock deal, valued at $768 million.

==Company information==
Rentrak has developed metrics to be used as database currencies for the evaluation and selling of entertainment content across many platforms including box office, multi-screen television, and home video. The company tracks viewing behavior from more than 35 million televisions across all 210 markets. It is the only company in the industry to provide video on demand measurement, obtained from set-top box data, and is also the sole provider of real-time box office ticket sales intelligence worldwide. Rentrak publishes weekly entertainment charts ranking the top ten in box office, video on demand, DVD sales and rentals, video game sales and TV engagement.

==History==
Rentrak began as a nationwide video chain named National Video, which was founded and incorporated in 1977. National Video founder Ron Berger developed what is now known as the pay-per-transaction (PPT) system, which allows studios and retailers to lease movie titles instead of purchasing them. The company went public in 1986.

In 1988, facing competition from rival Blockbuster Video, Berger sold the National Video franchise chain and renamed the company Rentrak. Ron Berger later resigned as CEO of Rentrak in 2000. Paul Rosenbaum was CEO from Sept. 2000 to June 2009, when Bill Livek was appointed CEO. Bill Livek extended his contract, along with the company’s COO/CFO, David Chemerow, to mid-2015 in November 2011.

In December 2009, Rentrak acquired Nielsen EDI, a leader in box office measurement, for $15 million. The deal made Rentrak the sole provider of worldwide box office ticket sales information for studios and industry analysts.

As of July 2015, more than 440 local stations from across 68 station groups use Rentrak&#x27;s StationView Essentials product for daily media measurement.

Mark Cuban, Internet billionaire, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and the HDNet networks, purchased 120,000 more Rentrak shares on August 22, 2011, and holds an 8.7 percent ownership stake in the company as of September 22, 2011. He had been accumulating Rentrak stock since 2004. He sold his interest in the company in May 2015.

==Financial information==
Total company revenue increased 32 percent to $28.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, up from $21.6 million for the same period last year. The company&#x27;s TV Everywhere product line grew 64%, its Movies Everywhere product line improved 10% on a constant currency basis, and its OnDemand Everywhere product line grew 21%.

<text>The Battle of North Point was fought on September 12, 1814, between General John Stricker&#x27;s Maryland Militia and a British force led by Major-General Robert Ross. Although the Americans were driven from the field, they were able to do so in good order having inflicted significant casualties on the British, killing Ross and demoralizing the troops under his command. Some of Ross&#x27;s units became lost among woods and swampy creeks during the battle, with others in similar states of confusion.

This combination of setbacks prompted Colonel Arthur Brooke to delay the British advance against Baltimore, buying valuable time to properly prepare for the defense of the city as Stricker retreated back to the main defenses to bolster the existing force. The engagement was a part of the larger Battle of Baltimore, an American victory in the War of 1812.

==Background==
===British movements===
Major General Robert Ross had been dispatched to Chesapeake Bay with a brigade of veterans from the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army early in 1814, reinforced with a battalion of Royal Marines. He had defeated a hastily assembled force of Maryland and District of Columbia militia at the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, and burned Washington. Having disrupted the American government, he withdrew to the waiting ships of the Royal Navy at the mouth of the Patuxent River before heading further up the Chesapeake Bay to the strategically more important port city of Baltimore, although the Americans managed to defeat a British landing at Caulk&#x27;s Field before doing so.

Ross&#x27;s army of 3,700 troops and 1,000 marines landed at North Point at the end of the peninsula between the Patapsco River and the Back River on the morning of September 12, 1814, and began moving toward the city of Baltimore.

===American defenses===
Major General Samuel Smith of the Maryland militia anticipated the British move, and dispatched Brigadier General John Stricker&#x27;s column to meet them. Stricker&#x27;s force consisted of five regiments of Maryland militia, a small militia cavalry regiment from Maryland, a battalion of three volunteer rifle companies and a battery of six 4-pounder field guns. Stricker deployed his brigade halfway between Hampstead Hill, just outside Baltimore, where there were earthworks and artillery emplacements, and North Point. At that point, several tidal creeks narrowed the peninsula to only a mile wide, and it was considered an ideal spot for opposing the British before they reached the main American defensive positions.

Stricker received intelligence that the British were camped at a farm just from his headquarters. He deployed his men between Bear Creek and Bread and Cheese Creek, which offered cover from nearby woods, and had a long wooden fence near the main road. Stricker placed the 5th Maryland Regiment and the 27th Maryland Regiment and his six guns in the front defensive line, with two regiments (the 51st and 39th) in support, and one more (the 6th) in reserve. He placed his men in mutually supporting positions, relying on numerous swamps and the two streams to stop a British flank attack, all of which he hoped would help avoid another disaster such as Bladensburg.

The riflemen initially occupied a position some miles ahead of Stricker&#x27;s main position, to delay the British advance. However, their commander, Captain William Dyer, hastily withdrew on hearing a rumour that British troops were landing from the Back River behind him, threatening to cut off his retreat. Stricker posted them instead on his right flank.

==Battle==
===Opening skirmish===
At about midday on the 12th, Stricker heard the British had halted while the soldiers had a meal, and some sailors attached to Ross&#x27;s force plundered nearby farms. He decided it would be better to provoke a fight rather than wait for a possible British night attack. At 1:00 pm, he sent Major Richard Heath with 250 men and one cannon to draw the British to Stricker&#x27;s main force.

Heath advanced down the road and soon began to engage the British pickets. When Ross heard the fighting, he quickly left his meal and ran to the scene. His men attempted to drive out the concealed American riflemen. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, second in command of the Royal Navy&#x27; American Station who usually accompanied Ross, was cautious about advancing without more support and Ross agreed that he would leave and bring back the main army. However, Ross never got the chance, as an American rifleman shot him in the chest. Mortally wounded, Ross turned command over to Colonel Arthur Brooke and died soon after.

===Main battle===
Brooke reorganized the British troops and prepared to assault the American positions at 3:00 pm. He decided to use his three cannon to cover an attempt by his 4th Regiment to get around the American flank, while two more regiments and the naval brigade would assault the American center. The British frontal assault took heavy casualties as the American riflemen fired into the British ranks, and lacking canister the Americans loaded their cannon with broken locks, nails and horseshoes, firing scrap metal at the British advance. Nevertheless, the British 4th Regiment managed to outflank the American positions and sent many of the American regiments fleeing. Stricker was able to conduct an organized retreat, with his men firing volleys as they continued to fall back. This proved effective, killing one of the British commanders and leaving some units lost among woods and swampy creeks, with others in confusion.

Not all the militia regiments performed with equal distinction. The 51st Regiment and some men of the 39th broke and ran under fire. However, the 5th and 27th held their ground and retreated in good order, having inflicted significant casualties on the enemy. Only one American gun was lost.

Corporal John McHenry of the 5th Regiment wrote of the battle:

Our Regiment, the 5th, carried off the praise from the other regiments engaged, so did the company to which I have the honor to belong cover itself with glory. When compared to the [other] Regiments we were the last that left the ground... had our Regiment not retreated at the time it did we should have been cut off in two minutes.

Brooke did not follow the retreating Americans. He had advanced to within a mile of the main American position, but he had suffered heavier casualties than the Americans. As it was getting dark, he chose to wait until Fort McHenry was expected to be neutralized, while Stricker withdrew to Baltimore&#x27;s main defences.

==Casualties==
The official British Army casualty report, signed by Major Henry Debbeig, gives 39 killed and 251 wounded. Of these, 28 killed and 217 wounded belonged to the British Army; 6 killed and 20 wounded belonged to the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Marines; 4 killed and 11 wounded belonged to the contingents of Royal Marines detached from Cockburn&#x27;s fleet; and 1 killed (Elias Taylor) and 3 wounded belonged to the Royal Marine Artillery. As was normal, the Royal Navy submitted a separate casualty return for the engagement, signed by Rear-Admiral Cockburn, which gives 4 sailors killed and 28 wounded but contradicts the British Army casualty report by giving 3 killed (1 and 2 from HMS &quot;Madagascar&quot; and HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; respectively) and 15 wounded for the Royal Marines detached from the ships of the Naval fleet. A subsequent casualty return from Cochrane to the Admiralty, dated September 22, 1814, gives 6 sailors killed, 1 missing and 32 wounded, with Royal Marines casualties of 1 killed and 16 wounded. The total British losses, as officially reported, were 43 killed and 279 wounded; 42 killed and 283 wounded; or 44 killed, 287 wounded and 1 missing: depending upon which of the versions of the casualty returns was accurate. Historian Franklin R. Mullaly gives still another version of the British casualties, 46 killed and 295 wounded, despite using these same sources. The American loss was 24 killed, 139 wounded and 50 taken prisoner.

==Aftermath==

The battle had been costly for the British. Apart from the other casualties, losing General Ross was a critical blow to the British. He was a respected leader of British forces in the Peninsular War and the War of 1812. Ross&#x27;s death proved a blow to British morale as well. The combined effect of the blow suffered at North Point and the failure of the Royal Navy to capture or get past Fort McHenry at the entrance to Baltimore harbor, despite a 25-hour bombardment, proved to be the turning point of the Battle of Baltimore. During the bombardment on Fort McHenry, Francis Scott Key was detained on a British ship at the entrance to Baltimore and penned the words to &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

The day after the battle, Brooke advanced cautiously towards Baltimore. There was no more opposition from Stricker, but when the British came into view of the main defenses of Baltimore, Brooke estimated them to be manned by up to 22,000 militia, with 100 cannon. He prepared to make a night assault against the defenses at Loudenslager Hill, but asked Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane to send boats and bomb ketches to silence an American battery, &quot;Roger&#x27;s Bastion&quot;, on the flank of his proposed attack. Despite a stiff fight between the boats, commanded by Captain Charles John Napier and the American batteries, the Bastion was unharmed and Brooke called off the attack and withdrew before dawn. The British re-embarked at North Point.

==Legacy==
The battle is commemorated through the Maryland state holiday of Defenders Day, as well as on the patch of the Baltimore County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The lineage of the 5th Maryland is perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment (MD ARNG), one of nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812.

The Maryland Museum of Military History, housed in the Fifth Regiment Armory in Baltimore, Maryland, features an exhibit on the Battle of Baltimore which was installed to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle.

<doc id="1335515" wikidata="Q153838" url="?curid=1335515" title="Grünenthal">
<text>Grünenthal is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Aachen in Germany. It was founded in 1946 as Chemie Grünenthal and has been continuously family-owned. The company was the first to introduce penicillin into the German market in the postwar period, after the Allied Control Council lifted its ban.

Grünenthal became infamous in the 1950s and 1960s for the development and sale of the teratogenic drug thalidomide, marketed as the sleeping pill Contergan and promoted as a morning sickness preventive. Thalidomide caused severe birth defects, miscarriages, and other severe health problems. Though these side effects were proven conclusively in 1959, and 1962, Grünenthal continued marketing the drug well into the 1970s and 1980s.

The company generates more than 50 percent of its income with pain medications such as Tramadol. The company has two offices in Germany as well as subsidiaries in Europe, Latin America, the US, and China. In November 2016, the company acquired Thar Pharmaceuticals and in 2018 Averitas Pharma.

== History ==

Chemie Grünenthal was founded in 1946 by Hermann Wirtz, Sr. A former Nazi party member, as Chemie Grünenthal GmbH in Stolberg (Rhineland). Later, it was renamed Grünenthal GmbH, and its headquarters were moved to Aachen. The Allied Control Council had prohibited the research and manufacture of penicillin by German companies. When the ban was lifted, Grünenthal was the first company to introduce penicillin in the postwar period into the German market. This investment achieved a big financial boost for the company.

=== Thalidomide (Contergan) ===
Under its Head of Research Heinrich Mückter, a former Nazi scientist, Grünenthal synthesised thalidomide in 1954 and acquired a 20-year patent. Soon after obtaining its patent in April 1954, the company started clinical trials, and from November 1956, marketed the drug for the treatment of respiratory infections under the trade name Grippex, a combination drug that contained thalidomide, quinine, vitamin C, phenacetin, and acetylsalicylic acid. Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal also found that the drug was particularly effective for pregnant women suffering from morning sickness, although no trials were run with pregnant women. In 1957, the company began marketing thalidomide as Contergan.

In 1958, an unusual number of deformities in newborns were reported in Germany. However, scientists first assumed nuclear tests to be the reason for that. Only in late 1961, researchers found out that Contergan must be the cause. In November 1961, thalidomide was thus taken off the market.

Thalidomide caused severe deformities in the children of women who took the drug during pregnancy. Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of about 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany. East German regulatory authorities did not approve thalidomide, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also declined to approve the drug. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects. Thalidomide had only been tested on rodents, as was usual practice at the time.

In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd. (which became part of Diageo plc in 1997) marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distaval as a remedy for morning sickness throughout the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed, &quot;Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country.&quot;

Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid 1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 (some reports suggest 51) different trade names.

In the US, representatives from Chemie Grünenthal initially approached Smith-Kline and French with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September, 1960. The official in charge of the FDA, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company requested approval six times and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born.

A Long Island, New York family sued the drug maker after their twins were born with deformities in May 1961. Their son was born without arms, with hands growing from his shoulders, and their daughter suffered from a number of internal deformities. The mother was a German woman who had met her husband in 1959 while studying at the University of Florence. She came to the United States with Contergan tablets she had brought from Germany and a prescription from her physician. The lawsuit alleged that Chemie Grünenthal was negligent in the testing of thalidomide and that they failed to warn of its effects on unborn children.

By 1968, the company stated that thalidomide was not recommended for use &quot;during pregnancy as such&quot;. The qualifying term obstetrics was employed. It was used in hindsight to strengthen the argument that doctors would interpret the word to mean that thalidomide was safe during the final stage of pregnancy only. This is a fallacious form of reasoning according to the German Medical Association, which defines obstetrics as starting with conception.

As a result of the thalidomide scandal, the health law in West Germany was strengthened and new requirements for pharmaceutical testing were created; the Federal Ministry of Health was established in 1962.

==== Criminal trial ====
In 1968, Grünenthal executives were tried for involuntary manslaughter. In 1970, the indictment was closed due to the minor guilt of the defendants and insufficient public interest in further proceedings.

==== Reparations ====
In 1970, Grünenthal paid DM 100 million to the , and the German government paid reparations of DM 320 million. Between 1997 and 2008, Grünenthal declined further payments to thalidomide victims. At the end of 2007, the British entrepreneur Nicholas Dobrik organised a group of victims and began an international campaign for further reparations. On 8 May 2008, Grünenthal announced it would voluntarily pay further €50 million to the Thalidomide Foundation to help to improve the lives of thalidomide victims.

==== Apology ====
In August 2012, the company issued its first apology in a half-century, saying it regretted the consequences of the drug. Harald Stock, Grunenthal&#x27;s chief executive, said the company had failed to reach out &quot;from person to person&quot; to the victims and their mothers over the past 50 years. The company has refused to compensate the Spanish victims of the drug who have sued the company.

==== Leprosy treatment ====
In 1964, Israeli physician Jacob Sheskin discovered the positive effect of thalidomide in the treatment of leprosy. Since the 1970s, Grünenthal has delivered thalidomide tablets to leprosy clinics to cure leprosy. The delivery takes place under strict conditions and by virtue of an agreement with the World Health Organization. Grünenthal provided thalidomide to more than 1,000 patients with leprosy in the United States until a few months before July, 1986. The drug is especially helpful to patients with leprosy in treating an extremely painful allergic reaction of the skin. The company discontinued exporting thalidomide because of liability fears. A lack of insurance coverage for those requiring the drug was also a problem.

=== Versatis and Tapentadol cases ===
In July 2010, the British Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) received complaints about a poster used by field-based teams at Grünenthal. It promoted the off-label use of Versatis, while the cost comparison analysis was flawed and misleading. The company stated that it had paid for the printing but no editorial control. Nevertheless, the Code of Practice was breached, and an undertaking was received.

In November 2010, the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) received an allegation that Grünenthal promoted its unlicensed product, Tapentadol, to health professionals. Grünenthal conducted an investigation and concluded that the allegation was unsubstantiated.

To date, the PMCPA website lists 16 completed cases involving Grünenthal.

=== Further drug development ===
The company has focused on the treatment of pain and is doing its own research and development in this field. Grünenthal developed the drug Tramadol, which is marketed under the brand name Tramal, one of the best-selling opioid painkillers. Other business units are gynecology, dermatology, and anti-infectives. Current products include the birth control pill Belara and the matrix pain patch Transtec. Unlike Tramadol, which is a Schedule IV(C-IV) medication, the drug Tapentadol HCl, as licensed by Grünenthal, is Schedule II(C-II) in the U.S. (meaning it is a potent agonist, therefore subject to abuse similar to other C-II opioids, such as oxycodone and morphine).

In 2018, Grünenthal acquired European rights to the pain-related brands Nexium and Vimovo and the US-rights for Qutenza (capsaicin). The company began building a US structure to commercialise the latter asset through Averitas Pharma. Nexium has since been removed from the market due to kidney damage. This drug also did not have sufficient testing before it was brought to market. Later in 2018, Grünenthal obtained global rights for Qutenza.

== Social commitment==
In 1998, the company launched the Grünenthal Foundation for Palliative Medicine. With its help, the first academic chair and clinic for palliative care was founded at the RWTH Aachen University in 2010.

Since 2004, Grünenthal supports young scientists through the EFIC-Grünenthal-Grant with €200,000 the world&#x27;s largest prize in its field. Bursaries of up to €30,000 are awarded per project.

Since 2009, the company has been member of the social initiative . Also, it is founding member of the organization .

<text>It&#x27;s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books is a 1988 American road film written, produced, and directed by Richard Linklater, who also stars in it.

==Plot==
The protagonist (played by Linklater) receives a cassette tape from a friend, with a recorded message encouraging him to &quot;blow off school&quot; and leave Austin. The protagonist goes about his daily activities, including shooting a gun from his window. He gets on a train and after a long journey, meets his friend in Missoula, Montana. They visit Glacier National Park and walk through town, before the protagonist leaves to visit West Coast cities such as San Francisco, also by train.

He arrives back in Austin, only to travel to a family reunion and his mother&#x27;s house. Finally, the protagonist returns to Austin once again.

==Production==
Richard Linklater began making short films upon moving to Austin, Texas in the late 1980s, where he also began running the Austin Film Society. The film was shot on Super 8 film over the course of a year.

==Release==
The film never received a widespread release, but was made available as a bonus feature on the DVD and Blu-ray release of Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Slacker&quot; (1990) by The Criterion Collection.

<text>Consideration is an English common law concept within the law of contract, and is a necessity for simple contracts (but not for special contracts by deed). The concept of consideration has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including in the United States.

Consideration can be anything of value (such as any goods, money, services, or promises of any of these), which each party gives as a quid pro quo to support their side of the bargain. Mutual promises constitute consideration for each other. If only one party offers consideration, the agreement is a &quot;bare promise&quot; and is unenforceable.

According to &quot;Currie v Misa&quot;, consideration for a particular promise exists where some &quot;right&quot;, &quot;interest&quot;, &quot;profit&quot; or &quot;benefit&quot; accrues (&quot;or will accrue&quot;) to the promisor as a direct result of some &quot;forbearance&quot;, &quot;detriment&quot;, &quot;loss&quot; or &quot;responsibility&quot; that has been given, suffered or undertaken by the promisee. Forbearance to act amounts to consideration only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.

&quot;Past consideration is no consideration&quot;: consideration must be &quot;executory&quot; or &quot;executed&quot;, but not &quot;past&quot;; that is, consideration must be supplied in the present or in the future, but things done beforehand cannot be good consideration.

*&quot;ex nudo pacto actio non oritur&quot;
*&quot;Dyer&#x27;s case&quot; (1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26
*&quot;Lucy v Walwyn&quot; was an early case on the doctrine of consideration, concerning an executory contract where the plaintiff recovered damages for the loss of a bargain.
*&quot;Thomas v Thomas&quot;. was a case where £1 was seen to be good consideration for a widow to continue to live in her house after her husband&#x27;s death. 
*&quot;White v Bluett&quot;: Bluett, when sued by his father&#x27;s executors for an outstanding debt to his father, claimed that his father had promised to discharge him from it in return for him stopping complaining about property distribution. The Court held that the cessation of complaints was of no economic value; thus, Bluett&#x27;s father had received no real consideration for the promise, and the debt was enforceable at law.
*&quot;Currie v Misa&quot; Lush J. referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor: &quot;&quot;... some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.&quot;
*&quot;Bolton v Madden&quot; Blackburn J, &quot;The general rule is that an executory agreement, by which the plaintiff agrees to do something on the terms that the defendant agrees to do something else, may be enforced if what the plaintiff has agreed to do is either for the benefit of the defendant or to the trouble or prejudice of the plaintiff.&quot;&quot;
*&quot;Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge &amp; Co Ltd&quot;: Lord Dunedin quotes the definition of Sir Frederick Pollock, &quot;&quot;An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought and the promise thus given for value is enforceable.&quot;

==Adequacy==
Consideration must have some value, even if it is only slight value, in order to be good consideration. It is not necessary for the consideration to be equivalent to the initial promise in terms of value. Nominal consideration will suffice as good consideration for a contract, Courts will not measure the adequacy of the consideration as it is up to the parties to decide the subjective worth of each promise.

In the British House of Lords case &quot;Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd&quot; (1959), Lord Somervell said: &quot;A contracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisor does not like pepper and will throw away the corn.&quot;&quot;

==Past conduct==
A promise cannot be based upon consideration that was said, given or done before the promise was performed. Something said afterwards, will not count as consideration. For example, if X promises to reward Y for an act that Y had already performed then while the performance of that act is good consideration, for the promise to be rewarded for it is past consideration and therefore not good consideration.

In &quot;Eastwood v Kenyon&quot; the guardian of a young girl raised a loan to educate the girl and to improve her marriage prospects. After her marriage, her husband promised to pay off the loan. It was held that the guardian could not enforce the promise as taking out the loan to raise and educate the girl was past consideration, because it was completed before the husband promised to repay it.

Furthermore, where a contract exists between two parties and one party, subsequent to formation, promises to confer an additional benefit on the other party to the contract, that promise is not binding because the promisee&#x27;s consideration, which is his entry into the original contract, had already been completed (or &quot;used&quot;) at the time the next promise is made.

In &quot;Roscorla v Thomas&quot;, Roscorla had contracted to buy a horse from Thomas for £30. After the sale, Thomas promised Roscorla that the horse was sound; the horse turned out to be vicious. It was held that Roscorla could not enforce the promise, as the consideration given for entering into the contract to buy the horse had been completed by the time the promise was made; in a sense, the consideration was &quot;used up&quot;.

The rule that past consideration is not good consideration is subject to the exception discussed by the Privy Council in &quot;Pao On v Lau Yiu Long&quot;. In that case, their Lordships held that past consideration can be good consideration where:
# The promisee performed the original act at the request of the promisor;
# It was clearly understood or implied between the parties that the promisee would be rewarded for the performance of the act;
# The actual promise made, if made before the promisee provided the consideration, must be capable of being enforced, in other words giving rise to a legally binding contract.

==Illusory consideration==
There must be some kind of connection between a promise and the consideration offered to support the promise. It is no consideration to &quot;refrain from a course of conduct which it was never intended to pursue&quot;. The consideration must have been at least an inducement to enter into the promise.

===Forbearing to sue===
*&quot;Callisher v Bischoffsheim&quot;, forbearance to sue in a groundless action still good consideration; honest mistake.

==Privity==

A promise is enforceable if it is supported by consideration, that is, where consideration has moved from the promisee. For example, in the case of &quot;Tweddle v Atkinson&quot;, John Tweddle promised William Guy that he would pay a sum of money to the child of William Guy, and likewise William Guy promised John Tweddle that he would pay a sum of money to the child of John Tweddle, upon the marriage of the two children to each other. However, William Guy failed to pay the son of John Tweddle, who then sued his executors for the amount promised. It was held that the son could not enforce the promise made to his father, as he himself had not actually given consideration for it - it was his father who had done so instead. The son didn&#x27;t receive any consideration, so he cannot enforce the promise. This particular rule of consideration forms the basis of the doctrine of privity of a contract, that is, only a party to a contract is permitted to sue upon that contract&#x27;s terms. (Note that the doctrine of privity has been somewhat altered by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.) Therefore, consideration from the promisee was indulgent of the claim. Although consideration must move from the promisee, it does not necessarily have to move to the promisor. The promisee may provide consideration to a third party, if this is agreed at the time the parties contracted.

The offeree must provide consideration, although the consideration does not have to flow to the offeror. For example, it is good consideration for person A to pay person C in return for services rendered by person B. If there are joint promisees, then consideration need only to move from one of the promisees.

==Pre-existing duties==
If the promisee provides what he was required by public law to do in any event in return for a promise, promised performance of existing duty is not good consideration. In &quot;Collins v Godefrey&quot; Godefrey promised to pay Collins for his giving of evidence. It was held that Collins could not enforce the promise as he was under a statutory duty to give evidence in any event.

However, if the promisee provides more than what public duty imposes on him, then this is good consideration. In &quot;Ward v Byham&quot; a mother was under a statutory duty to look after her child. The ex-husband promised to pay her £1 a week if she ensured that the child was well looked after and happy. It was held that notwithstanding the statutory duty imposed on the mother, she could enforce the promise since the act of keeping the baby &#x27;happy&#x27; provided additional consideration.

Promising to perform a pre-existing duty owed to one&#x27;s contracting party also fails to make good consideration. However this rule has been considerably narrowed by recent case law. The general rule is that if a creditor promises to discharge a debt in return for a fraction of payment, in paying the agreed fraction, the promisee is not providing consideration for the promise, as this is merely part performance of a contractual duty already owed. Consequently, the debtor is still liable for the whole amount, as he cannot force the promisor to accept less. A leading example is in &quot;Stilk v Myrick&quot; where Stilk, a seaman, agreed with Myrick to sail his boat to the Baltic Sea and back for £5 per month. During the voyage, two men deserted. Myrick promised he would increase Stilk&#x27;s wages if Stilk agreed to honour his contract in light of the desertions. Stilk agreed and on return to port, Myrick refused to pay him the extra wages. It was held that Myrick&#x27;s fresh promise was not enforceable as the consideration Stilk had provided for it, the performance of a duty he already owed to Myrick under contract, was not good consideration for Myrick&#x27;s promise to increase his wages.

Initially, there were only two exceptions to this rule:
*&quot;Hanson v Royden&quot;, the promisee has done, or has promised to do, more than he was obliged to do under his contract.
*&quot;Hartley v Ponsonby&quot; before the fresh promise was made, circumstances had arisen which would have entitled the promisee to refuse to carry out his obligations under his contract.

===Factual benefits===
However, the strictness of this rule was severely limited in &quot;Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd&quot;. The Roffey Brothers entered into a contract to refurbish a block of flats for a fixed price of £20,000. They sub-contracted carpentry work to Williams. It became apparent that Williams was threatened by financial difficulties and would not be able to complete his work on time. This would have breached a term in the main contract, incurring a penalty. Roffey Brothers offered to pay Williams an additional £575 for each flat completed. Williams continued to work on this basis, but soon it became apparent that Roffey Brothers were not going to pay the additional money. He ceased work and sued Roffey Brothers for the extra money, for the eight flats he had completed after the promise of additional payment. The Court of Appeal held that Roffey Brothers must pay Williams the extra money, as they had enjoyed practical benefits from the promise they had made to Williams. The benefits they received from it include: Having the work completed on time, not having to spend money and time seeking another carpenter and not having to pay the penalty. In the circumstances, these benefits were sufficient to provide consideration for the promise made to Williams of additional payment. It now seems that the performance of an existing duty may constitute consideration for a new promise, in the circumstances where no duress or fraud are found and where the practical benefits are to the promisor. The performance of an existing contractual duty owed to the promisor is not good consideration for a fresh promise given by the promisor. However, performance of an existing contractual duty owed to a third party can be good consideration, see further below.

According to the Court of Appeal, it is unlikely that either avoiding a breach of contract with a third party, avoiding the trouble and expense of engaging a third party to carry out work or avoiding a penalty clause in a third party contract will be a &quot;practical benefit&quot;. In &quot;Simon Container Machinery Ltd v Emba Machinery AB&quot;, the practical benefit was held to be the avoiding of a breach of contract, which was clearly not an extension of the principle.

This is true unless the debtor provided fresh consideration for the promise. The following, mentioned in &quot;Pinnel&#x27;s Case&quot;, and confirmed by &quot;Sibree v. Tripp&quot;, may amount to fresh consideration:
# If the promisee offers part payment earlier than full payment was due, and this is of benefit to the creditor;
# If the promisee offers part payment at a different place than where full payment was due, and this is of benefit to the creditor; or,
# If the promisee pays the debt in part by another chattel (note, however, that part payment by cheque, where full payment was due by another means, is not consideration.)

Another exception is that part payment of the debt by a third party as consideration for a promise to discharge the creditor from the full sum, prevents the creditor then suing the debtor for full payment (see &quot;Welby v Drake&quot;).

The Court of Appeal, in &quot;Re Selectmove Ltd&quot;, stated that the &quot;practical benefit doctrine&quot;, arising from &quot;Williams v Roffey&quot;, cannot be used as an additional exception to the rule. In that case, it was held that the doctrine only applies where the original promise was a promise to pay extra and not to pay less. The Court of Appeal in &quot;Re Selectmove&quot; were unable to distinguish &quot;Foakes v Beer&quot; (a House of Lords decision), in order to apply &quot;Williams v Roffey&quot; (a Court of Appeal decision). It therefore remains to be seen whether the House of Lords would decide this point differently. In any event, the equitable principle of promissory estoppel may provide the debtor with relief.

The Court of Appeal in June 2016 in &quot;MWB v Rock Advertising&quot; revisited the issue of whether the &quot;practical benefit doctrine&quot; could be applied to decreasing pacts or agreements to accept less. Arden LJ and Kitchin LJ both endorsed this approach indicating that part payment along with practical benefit &quot;could&quot; be enough to support a promise to accept less. The decision has been criticised as extending the practical benefit test beyond its limits.

===Existing duties to third parties===
Consideration for a promise can be the performance of a contractual duty owed to someone other than the promisor. In &quot;Shadwell v Shadwell&quot;, Cayley Shadwell was under a contractual duty with a third party to marry. His uncle, Charles Shadwell promised to pay him £150 per year after he was married. It was held that Cayley Shadwell marrying was good consideration, notwithstanding that he was obliged by a contract with a third party to marry in any event.

A promise to perform a pre-existing contractual duty owed to a third party (as opposed to the performance of that duty) may also amount to consideration.

==Alternatives==

*&quot;Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co&quot; AL Smith LJ, &quot;I understand that if there is no consideration for a promise, it may be a promise in honour, or a nudum pactum; but if anything else is meant, I do not understand it. I do not understand what a bargain or a promise or an agreement in honour is unless it is one on which an action cannot be brought because it is nudum pactum. In my judgment, this first point fails, and this was an offer intended to be acted upon, and, when acted upon and the conditions performed, constituted a promise to pay&quot;.
*&quot;Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith&quot;, Baragwanath J, &quot;The importance of consideration is as a valuable signal that the parties intend to be bound by their agreement, rather than an end in itself. Where the parties who have already made such intention clear by entering legal relations have acted upon an agreement to a variation, in the absence of policy reasons to the contrary, they should be bound by their agreement.&quot;

<doc id="1335523" wikidata="Q286384" url="?curid=1335523" title="Stone Phillips">
<text>Stone Stockton Phillips (born December 2, 1954) is an American television reporter and correspondent on NBC, ABC and PBS. He is best known as the former co-anchor of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, a news magazine TV series. He&#x27;s also worked as a substitute anchor for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; and as a substitute moderator on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Prior to his tenure at NBC, he was an ABC News correspondent for &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.

==Early life==
Phillips was born December 2, 1954, in Texas City, Texas, to parents Victor and Grace Phillips, a Monsanto chemical engineer and school teacher, respectively. Victor Phillips is a veteran of World War II. Phillips and his siblings—brother Victor III and sister Minta—were raised in the Claymont section of Ballwin, Missouri, in the Greater St. Louis area.

As a boy Phillips was an acolyte at St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Ellisville, Missouri, where his parents were founding members of the congregation. Phillips attended Parkway West High School in Ballwin, Missouri, where he was an honor student and starting quarterback on the football team. Phillips is of Scottish ancestry.

Phillips matriculated at Yale University where he continued to excel in academics and in athletics. In 1976, he was starting quarterback for the Yale Bulldogs squad that won the Ivy League football championship. Phillips was a member of Yale&#x27;s Scroll and Key secret society and earned the university&#x27;s prestigious F. Gordon Brown Award for outstanding academic and athletic leadership. Phillips graduated with honors from Yale in 1977, earning a Bachelor of Philosophy.

==Broadcasting career (1978–2013)==
After graduating from Yale, Phillips moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked as a remedial reading and math teacher at the Fulton County Juvenile Detention Center. He was supplementing his pay by moonlighting as a waiter when he landed an entry-level news position at WXIA-TV, the local NBC affiliate.

In 1980, after less than two years as a reporter, writer, and broadcast producer in Atlanta, Phillips was hired by ABC News as an assignment editor for its Washington, D.C., news bureau. In 1982, he began filing stories as an on-air correspondent for ABC, covering such major events as the war in Lebanon, the exodus of Vietnamese boat people in the mid-1980s, and Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s election campaign following the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi. In 1986, Phillips was promoted to a regular role on the ABC news magazine &quot;20/20&quot;. Beginning that year, he also served as a substitute host on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and a sports anchor for ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Sunday&quot;.

Phillips ended his twelve-year relationship with ABC in 1992, joining NBC News to serve 11 years as co-anchor with Jane Pauley and co-anchoring with Ann Curry 4 years on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;. While at NBC News, Phillips also hosted &quot;Weekend Magazine with Stone Phillips&quot;. He conducted a long list of notable interviews during his time with NBC. Among them was the first network interview with Lynndie England, the U.S. Army soldier, about her role in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Others included notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and Bernhard Goetz (a man who shot four black teenagers in the New York City Subway). The last earned Phillips an Emmy Award for Outstanding Interview. Phillips co-anchored &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; from its inception until July 2, 2007, when NBC did not renew his $7 million contract.

On October 17, 2005, Phillips was the guest on the premiere episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. Phillips&#x27; delivery was part of the inspiration for comedian Stephen Colbert&#x27;s persona on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.&quot; On December 18, 2014, Phillips would again appear on the final episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

As of 2012, Phillips was contributing reports to the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;. In 2013, he reported on golf course water usage for The Golf Channel.

<doc id="1335525" wikidata="Q4021166" url="?curid=1335525" title="Chinese word for crisis">
<text>In Western popular culture, the Chinese word for crisis () is often incorrectly said to comprise two Chinese characters meaning &#x27;danger&#x27; (, ) and &#x27;opportunity&#x27; (, ). The second character is a component of the Chinese word for &quot;opportunity&quot; (, ), but has multiple meanings, and in isolation means something more like &#x27;change point&#x27; or inflection point. The mistaken etymology became a trope after it was used by John F. Kennedy in his presidential campaign speeches and has been widely repeated in business, education, politics and the press in the United States.

==Origins==

Sinologist Victor H. Mair of the University of Pennsylvania states the popular interpretation of &quot;weiji&quot; as &quot;danger&quot; plus &quot;opportunity&quot; is a &quot;widespread public misperception&quot; in the English-speaking world. The first character () does indeed mean &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;precarious&quot;, but the second character () is highly polysemous. It is argued that does not mean &quot;opportunity&quot; in this case, but something more like &quot;change point&quot;. The confusion likely arises from the fact that the character for is a component of the Chinese word for &quot;opportunity&quot;, ().

==History==
American linguist Benjamin Zimmer has traced mentions in English of the Chinese term for crisis as far as an anonymous editorial in a 1938 journal for missionaries in China. The American public intellectual Lewis Mumford contributed to the spread of this idea in 1944 when he wrote: &quot;The Chinese symbol for crisis is composed of two elements: one signifies danger and the other opportunity.&quot; However, its use likely gained momentum in the United States after John F. Kennedy employed this trope in presidential campaign speeches in 1959 and 1960, possibly paraphrasing Mumford: &quot;In the Chinese language, the word &quot;crisis&quot; is composed of two characters, one representing danger and the other, opportunity.&quot;

The word has since become a staple meme for American business consultants and motivational speakers, as well as gaining popularity in educational institutions, politics and the popular press. For example, in 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice applied it during Middle East peace talks. Former Vice President Al Gore has done so numerous times, such as in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives, in the introduction of &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, and in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance lecture.

Benjamin Zimmer attributes the appeal of this anecdote to its &quot;handiness&quot; as a rhetorical device and optimistic &quot;call to action&quot;, as well as to &quot;wishful thinking&quot;.

<doc id="1335531" wikidata="Q283107" url="?curid=1335531" title="Charles the Younger">
<text>Charles the Younger ( – 4 December 811) was the son of the Frankish ruler Charlemagne and his wife Queen Hildegard. Charlemagne&#x27;s second son, Charles gained favour over his older, possibly illegitimate half brother Pepin. Charles was entrusted with lands and important military commands by his father. In 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor by Pope Leo III, and during this ceremony Charles was anointed a king. Charles was designated as the heir of the bulk of Charlemagne&#x27;s lands but predeceased his father, leaving the empire to be inherited by his younger brother Louis the Pious.

==Life==
Charles was born in 772 or 773 to the Frankish king Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard. Charles was Charlemagne&#x27;s second son, having an older half-brother named Pepin, called Pepin the Hunchback. In 774, as Charlemagne was besieging Pavia, capital of the Lombard Kingdom, he sent for Hildegard and his sons to join the army at the camp outside the city. Charlemagne conquered the city by June 774, becoming king of the Lombards in addition to being king of the Franks. Charlemagne and his family returned north to Francia by July or August. There is little recorded of the rest of Charles&#x27; childhood. It is known that Charlemagne had all his children educated in the liberal arts, and his sons received training in riding, combat, and hunting.

In 781, Charlemagne and Hildegard brought their younger children, including their sons Carloman and Louis to Rome, leaving Pepin and Charles in Francia. In Rome, Pope Adrian I baptized the children, and in the process Carloman was renamed Pepin, now sharing a name with his half-brother. The newly renamed Pepin and Louis were also then anointed and crowned, Pepin appointed king of the Lombards and Louis king of Aquitaine. The two new kings, still young children, were sent to their new kingdoms to be raised by regents and advisors in their own courts. Italy and Aquitaine were additions to Charlemagne&#x27;s realm, and it is possible that in assigning them to his younger sons, Charlemagne intended the core Frankish kingdom to be a split inheritance between Charles and the elder Pepin. 

Charles received his first command as he came of age in 784, leading an army in Westphalia during a campaign of the Saxon Wars. From then on, Charles &quot;gained continual prominence a his father&#x27;s deputy&quot; and he would continue to be given army commands in Saxony. In 789, Charlemagne granted Charles rule of &quot;the kingdom west of the Seine,&quot; corresponding to the Duchy of Maine in Neustria. It was proposed that Charles wed Ælfflæd, daughter of King Offa of Mercia and forge an alliance between the Franks and the Anglo-Saxon king. Offa was amenable, but insisted that Charles&#x27; sister Bertha also be married to his own son. Charlemagne was insulted by this, and the marriage did not occur. Charlemagne declared a blockade on all trade from England, which lasted three years until a treaty negotiated by Alcuin of York was agreed to.
Dissension seemingly grew between Charles and his elder half-brother. Wandelbert, a monk writing in the mid-ninth century, recounts a story of the two brothers travelling with their father down the Rhine, each in their own boat. By chance, both stopped at the church dedicated to Saint Goar and, moved by the holiness of the church and the saint, &quot;they now came together in brotherly concord and a pledge of friendship.&quot; This dissension between Charles and Pepin was likely over the succession. Pepin was the son of Himiltrude, whose precise relationship with Charlemagne was unclear. By the 780s, Pepin was seen as illegitimate, and though earlier Frankish inheritance practices did not distinguish sons by their mother&#x27;s marital status, it seems this distinction was becoming important. This apparent sidelining of Pepin was signaled by Charles&#x27; status as his father&#x27;s deputy on campaigns, while Pepin received no such commands. Following his grant of lands in Maine, Charles began to be described as , or &quot;first-born&quot;, despite Pepin being older. In 792, Pepin conspired with Bavarian nobles to assassinate Charlemagne, Charles, Pepin and Louis (who had all gathered at Regensburg) and install himself as king. The plot was discovered and revealed to Charlemagne. Pepin was sent to a monastery and many of his co-conspirators were executed.

In 800 Charles joined his father in surveying his lands and defenses in Neustria where Danish pirates had been raiding, before the two travelled to Rome together. Charlemagne went to Rome to oversee the restoration of Pope Leo III. At mass on Christmas Day, 25 December 800, Leo crowned Charlemagne as emperor and anointed Charles as a king.

Charles continued to be a key lieutenant and military leader for his father, as Charlemagne rarely led armies directly in his later year. In 804, Charles was assigned the privilege of escorting Leo III north on the Pope&#x27;s final visit to Francia. Frankish annals record Charles&#x27; successful campaigns against the Bohemians, Sorbs, and other Slavic groups in 805 and 806. In 806, Charlemagne issued the , which outlined formalized plans for the inheritance of the empire upon his death. Charles, as his eldest son in good favour, was given the largest share of the inheritance, with rule of Francia proper along with Saxony, Nordgau, and parts of Alemannia. Louis and the younger Pepin were confirmed in their kingdoms of Aquitaine and Italy, and gained additional territories, with most of Bavaria and Alemmannia given to Pepin and Provence, Septimania, and parts of Burgundy to Louis. Charlemagne did not address the inheritance of the imperial title. The also addressed the death of any of the brothers, and urged peace between them and between any of their nephews who might inherit. In 808, Charles led the Frankish armies that responded to the incursion of the Danish king Gudfred.

Charlemagne&#x27;s succession plans did not come to fruition. Pepin of Italy, along with his sister Rotrude, aunt Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, and his half brother Pepin the Hunchback died in quick succession in 810–811. Charles followed them, dying on 4 December 811. All were possibly victims of an epidemic that had spread from cattle in 810. Charles&#x27; place of death and burial are unknown. In the wake of these deaths, Charlemagne declared Pepin&#x27;s son Bernard ruler of Italy, and his own only surviving son Louis as heir to the rest of the empire. Louis was crowned as emperor in 813, and would fully succeed Charlemagne upon his death in 814.

<doc id="1335533" wikidata="Q2577663" url="?curid=1335533" title="Bodoland Territorial Region">
<text>The Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) is an autonomous division in Assam, India, and a proposed state in Northeast India. It is made up of five districts on the north bank of the Brahmaputra River below the foothills of Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh. It is administered by an elected body known as the Bodoland Territorial Council which came into existence under the terms of a peace agreement signed in February 2003 and its autonomy was further extended by an agreement signed in January 2020. The region covers an area of over nine thousand square kilometres and is predominantly inhabited by the Bodo people and other indigenous communities of Assam.

== Etymology of &quot;Bodoland&quot; ==

The Plains Tribes Council of Assam had demanded, since its inception in 1967, for a separate union territory for the Boro and other plain tribes to be called &quot;Udayachal&quot;. With the failure of PTCA, the All Bodo Students&#x27; Union launched the Bodo Movement in 1987 with the demand for a separate state to be called &quot;Bodoland&quot;, ending with the Bodo Accord of 1993 with the formation of Bodoland Autonomous Council. Bodoland is named after &quot;Bodo&quot;, an alternative spelling of the Boro people who live primarily in the Dooars regions of Goalpara and Kamrup districts.

== History ==

Originally a part of Bhutan, this region came under the control of Koch king Vishwa Singha in the early 16th century. Around 1562, the successor king Nara Narayan determined that the Meches and Koches peoples north of the newly constructed Gohain Kamal Ali could follow their indigenous customs whereas peoples to its south had to follow Hindu Brahmanical rites. After the split of the Koch kingdom and subsequent collapse of the eastern Koch Hajo due to the Mughals and during the period of Ahom-Mughal conflicts in early 17th century the Bhutan kingdom pushed south and took control of the region down to the Gohain Kamal Ali. Following the Battle of Itakhuli in 1681 the Ahom kingdom consolidated their rule up to the Manas river in the west and the region north of the Gohain Kamal Ali, divided into different &quot;Duars&quot;, fell into its possession. The Ahoms soon faced trouble from the Bhutanese, in the form of incursions, raids, and violent opposition, beginning about 1688, to tax collection by the Ahoms. Eventually these clashes came to an end with a written agreement.

Duars between Sankosh river and Manas River were collectively known as the Eastern Duars, those between Manas River and Barnadi River were collectively known as Kamrup Duars, and those between Barnadi River and Dhansiri River were collectively known as Darrang Duars. The duars to the west of Goalpara were called Western Duars.

The &quot;Duars&quot; in the Goalpara region (which was outside the Ahom kingdom) were under Bhutan&#x27;s control, but the administration of the Duars to east were shared between Bhutan or Tibet and the Ahom kingdom under different mechanisms. The &quot;Duars&quot; in the Kamrup region followed the &quot;posa&quot; system in which the Bhutanese were given possession of the duars in lieu of an annual payment; and those in the Darrang region were alternately controlled by the Bhutanese and the Ahoms in an annual cycle. The Bhutanese control over these regions were via local authorities, not ethnic Bhutanese, who were appointed by Bhutanese provincial governors called &quot;Ponlops&quot;

After the British took control of Ahom kingdom in 1826, they maintained the Ahom-Bhutan arrangement for a while but the payments made in kind and the shared administration were something the colonial administration was unwilling to maintain and annexed the Kamrup and Darrang Duars in 1841 and the Kariapar Duar in 1844; and following the Duar War in 1865 took complete possession of the Duars and removed Bhutanese interest from the Goalpara and Western Duars for good. The duars associated with the historical regions of Goalpara, Kamrup, and Darrang were then added to these districts.

===Demand for statehood===
Along with the other parts of Northeast India, regional aspiration in the region reached a turning point in the 1980s. The isolation of the region, its complex social character, and its backwardness compared to other parts of the country have all resulted in the complicated set of demands ranging from demand for autonomy and opposition to migrants to movements for secession.

The region is also the gateway to the North Eastern Region of India, where one of the main students organization, All Bodo Students Union (ABSU), allied with National Democratic Front of Boroland – Progressive (NDFB-P), National Democratic Front of Boroland – D.R. Nabla faction, People&#x27;s Joint Action Committee for Boroland Movement (PJACBM) which is an amalgamation of over three dozen Bodo organisations and its supporters are demanding from the Government of India that a separate state (within the Indian Union) be created comprising the seven districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa, Udalguri, Sonitpur, Lakhimpur and Dhemaji of Assam which have a significant Bodo population. On the other hand, it is also claimed as a sovereign state (complete independence from India) by the separatist insurgent group NDFB.

====1993 and 2003 peace agreements====
Following an agreement in 1993, Bodoland became an autonomous administrative unit constituted under the Sixth Schedule area of the Constitution of India covering an area of 8,795 km2 administered by the Bodoland Autonomous Council.

Following a further peace agreement, the Bodoland Territorial Council was formed in 2003, with a mission to accomplish development in the area of economic, education, preservation of land right, linguistic aspiration, socio-culture and ethnic identity of Bodos and above all to speed up the infrastructure development of communities in the Bodoland area. The actual functioning of the council was started on 7 December 2003 by constituting the 12 members of the Council provisionally.

After the Council Election on 13 May 2005 and subsequent bye-election in November 2005, the 40-member Legislative Council has been formed to look after the development works in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts. The remaining six members are nominated by the Governor of Assam from the unrepresented Communities. Thus there are altogether 46 members of the council, representing all communities of BTC Area known as Member of Council Legislative Assembly (MCLA).

==== 2020 peace agreement and the formation of the Bodoland Territorial Region ====
A new peace agreement was signed on 27 January 2020 between the Government of India and the Government of Assam on one side and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), the All Bodo Students’ Union and United Bodo People&#x27;s Organisation on the other. Under the terms of this agreement, a Bodoland Territorial Region was formed with enhanced executive and legislative powers. The Bodoland Territorial Council will have competency over almost all areas defined by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India and its membership will be increased to 60. The boundary of BTR will be redrawn to make Boro speakers majority within the region. This will be done by forming new districts and the boundary of the region will be adjusted to include contiguous Bodo inhabited areas from neighbouring districts and exclude the non-Bodo inhabited territories which are currently under the jurisdiction of the BTC. On 26 January 2023, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma have decided to include 60 more villages which have at least 80% Bodo population in the Bodoland Territorial Region, in order to make Bodo-speakers a slight majority.

Bodoland will also have the right to autonomously be represented at national level sports and cultural events such as the National Games of India and the Khelo India Youth Games. The agreement also makes the Bodo language with Devnagri script an associate official language of Assam.

==Government and politics==
===Bodoland Territorial Council===

The region is administered by an elected body known as the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) which was established according to the Memorandum of Settlement of 10 February 2003. BTC came into existence immediately after the surrender of Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (BLTF). The BLTF laid down their weapons on 6 December 2003 under the leadership of Hagrama Mohilary and Shri Hagrama Mohilary was sworn in as the Chief Executive Member (CEM) on 7 December 2003.

The BTC has 46 members (30 seats reserved for scheduled Tribes, 5 seats for non-scheduled tribes and 5 open seats) and 6 seats of which are nominated by Governor of Assam from unrepresented communities. The council appoints a cabinet of 14 executive members each looking after a specific area of control.

===Districts===
The Bodoland region is made up of five districts which are further subdivided into 10 Civil Subdivisions and 40 Development Blocks.

The area and population of these districts has been estimated as follows:

Under the terms of a peace agreement signed in January 2020, new districts will be created with the existing four districts reorganised into seven districts. The area of the region will be enlarged and will also include two new districts created from areas currently outside the region. The total number of districts within the Bodoland region will therefore be nine. In January 2022, Tamulpur district was created by separating the Tamulpur sub-division from Baksa district.

; The proposed new districts created from districts currently within the Bodoland region are:
* Gossaigaon district, from Kokrajhar district
* Bhergaon district, from Udalguri district

; The proposed new districts created from districts currently outside the Bodoland region are:
* Mainaosri district, from Sonitpur district
* Holongi district, from Biswanath district and Lakhimpur district

==Geography==

The geographical boundary of the BTR lies between 26° 7&#x27;12&quot; N to 26° 47&#x27; 50&quot; N Latitude and 89° 47&#x27; 40&quot; E to 92° 18&#x27; 30&quot; E Longitude and is in the Northwestern part of Assam. Kokrajhar town the Administrative Head Quarter lies roughly between 26° 25&#x27; N latitude and 90° 16&#x27; 38&quot; E Longitude.

<text>The Supreme Court (; colloquially referred to as the Korte Suprema (also used in formal writing), is the highest court in the Philippines. The Supreme Court was established by the Second Philippine Commission on June 11, 1901 through the enactment of its Act No. 136, an Act which abolished the &quot;Real Audiencia de Manila&quot;, the predecessor of the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court compound is located in what was formerly a part of the University of the Philippines Manila campus. It occupies the corner of Padre Faura Street and Taft Avenue in Ermita, Manila, with the main building sited directly in front of Philippine General Hospital&#x27;s cancer institute.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to the conquest of Spain, the islands of the Philippines were composed of independent barangays, each of which is a community composed of 30 to 100 families. Typically, a barangay is headed by a &quot;datu&quot; or a local chief who exercises all functions of government: executive, legislative and judicial; he is also the commander-in-chief in times of war. Each barangay has its own laws. Laws may be oral laws, which are the traditions and customs of the locality handed down from generation to generation, or written laws as promulgated by the &quot;datu&quot;, who is typically aided by a group of elders. In a confederation of barangays, the laws are promulgated by a superior &quot;datu&quot; with the aid of the inferior &quot;datus&quot;.

In a resolution of dispute, the &quot;datu&quot; acts as a judge while a group of elders sits as a jury. If a dispute is between &quot;datus&quot; or between members of different barangays, the dispute is settled through arbitration with some other &quot;datus&quot; or elders, from other barangays, serving as arbiters or mediators. All trials are held publicly. When a &quot;datu&quot; is in doubt as to who between the parties is guilty, the parties are subject to trial by ordeal this is a common practice in criminal cases. An accused who was innocent was perceived to be always successful in such ordeals. These pre-Hispanic people believed that the deities or gods would aid the innocent accused to survive the ordeal.

===Spanish colonial era===
In the royal order of August 14, 1569, Miguel López de Legazpi was confirmed as the Governor and Captain-General of the Philippines. He was empowered to administer civil and criminal justice in the islands. Under the same order, Legazpi had original and appellate jurisdiction in all suits and constituted in his person all authority of a department of justice, with complete administrative and governmental control of all judicial offices. In subsequent &quot;cédulas&quot; and royal orders, it was made the responsibility of all officials to enforce all laws and ordinances issued for the benefits of the locals. This often failed to occur. In a 1583 letter written by Bishop Domingo de Salazar to King Philip II, Bishop Salazar noted different acts of oppression and injustice committed against the native Filipinos and said that the decrees of the King, which were designed to protect them, were generally disregarded by the Governor-General and his subordinates.

As a result of these developments, the first &quot;real audiencia&quot; (which is the &quot;Real Audiencia of Manila&quot;) or high court was established in the Philippines through the royal decree of May 5, 1583. The decree stated that &quot;the court is founded in the interests of good government and the administration of justice, with the same authority and preeminence as each of the royal audiencias in the town of Valladolid and the city of Granada. The audiencia was composed of a president, three &quot;oidores&quot; or auditors, a fiscal or prosecuting attorney, and the necessary auxiliary officials, such as the court&#x27;s secretaries and clerks. The first president was Governor-Captain General Santiago de Vera.

The &quot;Real Audiencia of Manila&quot; had a jurisdiction covering Luzon and the rest of the archipelago. It was given an appellate jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases decided by the governors, &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot; and other magistrates of the islands. The &quot;audiencia&quot; may only take cognizance of a civil case in its first instance when, on account of its importance, the amount involved and the dignity of the parties might be tried in a superior court; and of criminal cases which may arise in the place where the &quot;audiencia&quot; might meet. The decisions of the audiencia in both civil and criminal cases were to be executed without any appeal, except in civil cases were the amount was so large as to justify an appeal to the King; such appeal to the King must be made within one year. All cases were to be decided by a majority vote, and in case of a tie, an advocate was chosen for the determination of the case.

The &quot;audiencia&quot; would later on be dissolved through the royal &quot;cédula&quot; of August 9, 1589. The &quot;audiencia&quot; would later on be reestablished through the royal decree of May 25, 1596, and on May 8, 1598, it had resumed its functions as a high court. By its reestablishment, the &quot;audiencia&quot; was composed of a president as represented by the governor, four associate justices, prosecuting attorney with the office of protector of the Indians, the assistant prosecuting officers, a reporter, clerk and other officials. By a royal order of March 11, 1776, the &quot;audiencia&quot; was reorganized; it consisted of the president, a regent, the immediate head of the &quot;audiencia&quot;, five &quot;oidores&quot; or associate justices, two assistant prosecuting attorneys, five subordinate officials, and two reporters. It had also been allowed to perform the duties of a probate court in special cases. When the high court is acting as administrative or advisory body, the &quot;audiencia&quot; acted under the name of &quot;real acuerdo&quot;. Later on the governor-general was removed as the president of the &quot;audiencia&quot; and the &quot;real acuerdo&quot; was abolished by virtue of the royal decree of July 4, 1861. The same royal decree converted the court to a pure judicial body, with its decisions appealable to the Supreme Court of Spain. By the royal decree of October 24, 1870, the &quot;audiencia&quot; was branched into two chambers; these two branches were later renamed as &quot;sala de lo civil&quot; and &quot;sala de lo criminal&quot; by virtue of royal decree of May 23, 1879.

On February 26, 1886, the territorial &quot;audiencia&quot; of Cebu was established through a royal decree, and covers the jurisdiction of the islands of Cebu, Negros, Panay, Samar, Paragua, Calamianes, Masbate, Ticao, Leyte, Jolo and Balabac, including the smaller and adjacent islands of aforementioned islands. By January 5, 1891, a royal decree had established the territorial &quot;audiencias&quot; of Manila and Cebu. By virtue of a royal decree, the territorial audiencia in Cebu continued until May 19, 1893 when it ceased to be territorial; its &quot;audiencia&quot; for criminal cases, however, was retained. From the same royal decree, the &quot;audiencia&quot; in Vigan was established and covers criminal cases in Luzon and Batanes. These courts decisions are not considered final as they are still appealable to the &quot;Audiencia Territorial of Manila&quot; and those of the audiencia to the Supreme Court of Spain. These &quot;audiencias&quot; would still continue to operate even until the outbreak of the Filipino rebellion in 1896.

===American invasion era===
From the start of occupation by United States forces on August 13, 1898, the &quot;audiencias&quot; of Cebu and Vigan ceased to function; the judges had fled for safety. The following day, Wesley Merritt, the first American Military Governor, ordered the suspension of the territorial jurisdiction of the colonial Real Audiencia of Manila, and of other minor courts in the Philippines. All trials of committed crimes and offenses were transferred to the jurisdiction of the court-martial or military commissions of the United States. 

On October 7, 1898, the civil courts throughout the islands, which were constituted under Spanish laws prior to August 13, were permitted to resume their civil jurisdiction, subject to supervision by the American military government. In January 1899, the civil jurisdiction of the &quot;audiencia&quot; in Manila was suspended. It was restored in May 29, 1899 after it was reestablished as the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands under . The criminal jurisdiction was also restored to the newly reformed civil high court.

On June 11, 1901, the current Supreme Court was officially established through enactment of Act No. 136, otherwise known as the Judiciary Law of the Second Philippine Commission. The said law reorganized the judicial system and vested the judicial power to the Supreme Court, Courts of First Instance and Justice of the Peace courts. The said law also provided for the early composition of the said High Court, having one Chief Justice and six Associate Justices—all appointed by the commission. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 and the Jones Act of 1916, both passed by the U.S. Congress, ratified the jurisdiction of the Courts vested by Act No. 136. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 further provides that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and its six Associate Justices shall be appointed by the President of the United States with the consent and advice of the U.S. Senate.

The enactment of the Administrative Code of 1917 made the Supreme Court the highest tribunal. It also increased the total membership of the Supreme Court, having one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices.

====Commonwealth period====
With the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines through the ratification of the 1935 Constitution, the Supreme Court&#x27;s composition was increased to eleven, with one Chief Justice and ten Associate Justices. The 1935 Constitution provided for the independence of the judiciary, the security of tenure of its members, prohibition on diminution of compensation during their term of office, and the method of removal of the justices through impeachment. The Constitution also transferred the rule-making of the legislature to the Supreme Court on 
the power to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice, court procedures, and admission to the practice of law.

===Japanese occupation era===

Within the brief Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the Court remained with no substantial changes in its organizational structure and jurisdiction. However, some acts and outlines of the Court were required to be approved first by the Military Governor of the Imperial Japanese Force. In 1942, José Abad Santos—the fifth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court—was executed by Japanese troops after refusing to collaborate with the Japanese military government. He was captured on April 11, 1942 in the province of Cebu and was executed on May 7, 1942 in the town of Malabang in Lanao del Sur.

===Philippine independence===
After the end of the Japanese occupation during World War II, Philippines was granted its independence on July 4, 1946 from the United States. The grant of independence was made through the Treaty of Manila of 1946. In the said treaty, it provides that:
In effect of the treaty, the United States Supreme Court ceased to have appellate power to review cases originating from the Philippines after its independence, with exception of those cases pending before the United States Supreme Court filed prior to the country&#x27;s independence.

On June 17, 1948, the Judiciary Act of 1948 was enacted. The law grouped cases together over which the high court could exercise its exclusive jurisdiction to review on appeal, &quot;certiorari&quot;, or writ of error.

In 1973, the 1935 Constitution was revised and was replaced by the 1973 Constitution. Under the said Constitution, the membership of the court was increased to its current number, which is fifteen. All members are said to be appointed by the President alone, without consent, approval, or recommendation of a body or officials. The 1973 Constitution also vested in the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all lower courts which heretofore was under the Department of Justice.

The martial law period brought in many legal issues of transcendental importance and consequence: some of which were the legality of the ratification of the 1973 Constitution, the assumption of the totality of government authority by President Marcos, the power to review the factual basis for a declaration of Martial Law by the Chief Executive.

===Post–EDSA revolution and present===
After the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, President Corazon Aquino, using her emergency powers, promulgated a transitory charter known as the &quot;Freedom Constitution&quot; which did not affect the composition and powers of the Supreme Court. The Freedom Charter was replaced by the 1987 Constitution which is the fundamental charter in force in the Philippines at present.
Under the current Constitution, it retained and carried the provision in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions that &quot;judicial power is vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.&quot; However, unlike the previous Constitutions, the current Constitution expanded the Supreme Court&#x27;s judicial power by defining it in the second paragraph of Section 1, Article VIII as:
The definition, in effect, diluted the political question doctrine, that it is best to submit specific questions or issues specific questions to the political wisdom of the people, and thus, as a result, are beyond the review of the courts.

Furthermore, the present Constitution provided for safeguards to ensure the independence of the Judiciary. It also provided for the Judicial and Bar Council, a constitutionally-created body that recommends appointees for vacancies that may arise in the composition of the Supreme Court and other lower courts.

===One-stop shop &amp; REAL Justice===
The SC Public Information Office announced the opening on March 1, 2024 the creation of a One-stop shop housing the Judicial Records office, Fiscal Management and Budget Office and the Office of the Bar Confidant. It is a part of the Supreme Court&#x27;s Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations. Alexander Gesmundo also inaugurated in Tawi-Tawi the &quot;Remote Hearing and Equal Access to Law and Justice&quot; (REAL Justice) program of the 2004 Justice on Wheels. The new program consists of 3 parts—&quot;the deployment of retrofitted buses to the territorial jurisdiction of courts which are difficult to reach, the providing alternative modes of transportation in order to bring technology to far-flung areas that could not be reached by buses and the use of the buses as mobile courts where bail procedures can be conducted on days when the court is not in session, &quot;so that those who are arrested would be able to post bail when necessary,&quot; Marvic Leonen said.

==Overview==
===Qualifications===
According to the Constitution, for a person to be appointed to the Supreme Court, he must be:
# a natural-born citizen of the Philippines; 
# at least forty years of age, and 
# have been for fifteen years or more a judge of a lower court or engaged in the practice of law in the Philippines.

An additional constitutional requirement, though less precise in nature, is that a judge &quot;must be a person of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence.&quot;

===Composition and manner of appointment===
Pursuant to Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, the Court is composed of the Chief Justice and of the fourteen Associate Justices, all of whom are appointed by the President from a list of nominees made by the Judicial and Bar Council. An appointment to the Supreme Court needs no confirmation of the Commission on Appointments as the nomination is already vetted by the Judicial and Bar Council, a constitutionally-created body which recommends appointments within the judiciary.

Upon a vacancy in the Court, whether for the position of Chief Justice or Associate Justice, the President fills the vacancy by appointing a person from a list of at least 3 nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council.

===Retirement===
The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines provides that:
Supreme Court Justices are obliged to retire upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. Some Justices have opted to retire before reaching the age of 70, such as Florentino Feliciano, who retired at 67 to accept appointment to the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization and Alicia Austria-Martinez who retired at 68 for health reasons.

Since 1901, Associate Justice Austria-Martinez was one of the first to opt for an early retirement from the service. In September 2008, Justice Martinez, citing health reasons, filed a letter with the Court through Chief Justice Reynato Puno, informing her colleagues of her intention to avail of early retirement effective April 30, 2009, or 15 months before her compulsory retirement on December 19, 2010. This was followed by Justice Martin Villarama Jr., who also retired prior to the age of 70 in January 2016 for health reasons.

==Seat==

The Supreme Court currently meets at the Supreme Court Main Building along Padre Faura Street, between the Department of Justice and the University of the Philippines Manila&#x27;s Rizal Hall.

The Court first met in 1901 at the Ayuntamiento de Manila in Plaza Roma, Intramuros with the Salas De Sessiones serving as the Session Hall. The Court eventually transferred to the Old Legislative Building together with Philippine Legislature in 1941 under Chief Justice José P. Laurel.

During World War II, the Court temporarily transferred to Mabini Hall of the Malacañang Palace due to the destruction of the Old Legislative Building and the Ayuntamiento.

In 1951, the Court transferred back to what is now the Court&#x27;s Old Building, originally built to house of School of Fine Arts and Conservatory of Music of the University of the Philippines. The façade of this building displays the busts of the first nine Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and the statues of Lady Justice and Moses at its entrance. The Court transferred to its current address in 1991, after the Department of Foreign Affairs, which previously occupied the edifice, transferred to the old headquarters of the Asian Development Bank along Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City, as the latter has relocated to Mandaluyong City.

The current main building of the Supreme Court was designed by the Filipino architect Antonio Toledo in accordance with the 1905 Burnham Plan of Manila. It originally housed the library of the University of the Philippines Manila. The four pillars at the façade represent the four levels of the hierarchy of the judiciary. The bronze seated figures of Chief Justices Cayetano Arellano and José Abad Santos guard each side of the entrance to the Court. Upon entering the building, the main lobby features the logo of the Court in the middle. To the right is the Dignitaries&#x27; Lounge and to the left is the Division Hearing Room. The second floor houses the portrait gallery of chief justices and the session hall, as well as the offices of the Chief Justice and 2 most senior associate justices.

Since 1948, The Supreme Court has held its summer sessions in Baguio during the whole month of April.

The Court is currently in the planning process for its eventual transfer to its new and permanent site. After initially inking a deal with BCDA to move to a complex in the planned Bonifacio Capital District in Taguig, it instead went for a bigger 25 hectare complex it received from San Miguel Aerocity, Inc. via the Department of Transportation. The new site is near the future New Manila International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan and will also house its relevant appellate courts: the Court of Appeals, Court of Tax Appeals, and the Sandiganbayan.

==Language==
Since the courts&#x27; creation, English had been used in court proceedings. But for the first time in Philippine judicial history on August 22, 2007, three Malolos City regional trial courts in Bulacan announced that will use only Filipino in court proceedings to promote the national language. Twelve stenographers from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of Bulacan State University College of Law following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Chief Justice Reynato Puno envisioned to implement the policy in other areas such as Laguna, Cavite, Quezon, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Rizal, and Metro Manila.

Spanish has also been used in court proceedings, particularly in the years prior to Philippine independence, with a number of cases having decisions written in the language. Although Spanish is no longer used in the court system, the language has influenced existing Philippine legal terminology.

=== Session opening announcement ===

The wording of the session opening announcement, below, is similar to that used by the Supreme Court of the United States. However, several key passages from the U.S. Supreme Court are omitted, including &quot;are admonished to draw near and give their attention&quot; and &quot;God save (name of country) and this Honorable Court.&quot; The prewar Philippine Supreme Court tried to inject these passages, but were prohibited from doing so by the American colonial government in Manila. Notable in the Philippine version of the chant is the use of the more familiar term &quot;hear ye&quot; over the archaic Law French term oyez.

The honorable, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye! All persons having business before the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippines shall give their attention, for the Court is now in session.

After the announcement, the Chief Justice bangs the gavel, and typically, first calls the clerk of court, who describes the first case on the calendar and calls the attorneys who will be making oral arguments to speak.

==Powers and jurisdiction==
===Adjudicatory powers===

The powers of the Supreme Court are defined in Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. These functions may be generally divided into two—judicial functions and administrative functions. The administrative functions of the Court pertain to the supervision and control over the Philippine judiciary and its employees, as well as over members of the Philippine bar. Pursuant to these functions, the Court is empowered to order a change of venue of trial in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice and to appoint all officials and employees of the judiciary. The Court is further authorized to promulgate the rules for admission to the practice of law, for legal assistance to the underprivileged, and the procedural rules to be observed in all courts.

The more prominent role of the Court is located in the exercise of its judicial functions. Section 1 of Article VIII contains definition of judicial power that had not been found in previous constitutions. The judicial power is vested in &quot;one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.&quot; This judicial power is exercised through the judiciary&#x27;s primary role of adjudication, which includes the &quot;duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.&quot;

The definition reaffirms the power of the Supreme Court to engage in judicial review, a power that had traditionally belonged to the Court even before this provision was enacted. Still, this new provision effectively dissuades from the easy resort to the political question doctrine as a means of declining to review a law or state action, as was often done by the Court during the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos. As a result, the existence of &quot;grave abuse of discretion&quot; on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government is sufficient basis to nullify state action.

===Original jurisdiction===
The other mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an original petition filed directly with the Supreme Court, in cases that the Constitution establishes &quot;original jurisdiction&quot; with the Supreme Court. Under Section 5(1), Article VIII of the Constitution, they are &quot;cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and over petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and habeas corpus.&quot; Resort to &quot;certiorari&quot;, prohibition and &quot;mandamus&quot; may be availed of only if &quot;there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.&quot;

However, notwithstanding the grant of original jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts such as the Court of Appeals the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to hear these petitions filed directly before it on the ground that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, cases that have attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution is of the essence have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.

In cases involving the original jurisdiction of the Court, there must be a finding of &quot;grave abuse of discretion&quot; on the part of the respondents to the suit to justify favorable action on the petition. The standard of &quot;grave abuse of discretion&quot;, a markedly higher standard than &quot;error of law&quot;, has been defined as &quot;a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack of jurisdiction.&quot;

===Appellate review===
Far and away the most common mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an appeal from a decision rendered by a lower court. Appealed cases generally originate from lawsuits or criminal indictments filed and tried before the trial courts. These decisions of the trial courts may then be elevated on appeal to the Court of Appeals, or more rarely, directly to the Supreme Court if only &quot;questions of law&quot; are involved. Apart from decisions of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may also directly review on appeal decisions rendered by the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals. Decisions rendered by administrative agencies are not directly appealable to the Supreme Court, they must be first challenged before the Court of Appeals. However, decisions of the Commission on Elections may be elevated directly for review to the Supreme Court, although the procedure is not, strictly speaking, in the nature of an appeal.

Review on appeal is not as a matter of right, but &quot;of sound judicial discretion and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons therefor&quot;. In the exercise of appellate review, the Supreme Court may reverse the decision of lower courts upon a finding of an &quot;error of law&quot;. The Court generally declines to engage in review the findings of fact made by the lower courts, although there are notable exceptions to this rule. The Court also refuses to entertain cases originally filed before it that should have been filed first with the trial courts.

===Rule-making power===
The Supreme Court has the exclusive power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and
procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the integrated bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Any such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi‐judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court. (Art. VIII, §54(5))

====Writs of &quot;amparo&quot; and &quot;habeas data&quot;====
The Supreme Court approved the Writ of Amparo on September 25, 2007. The writ of amparo (Spanish for protection) strips the military of the defense of simple denial. Under the writ, families of victims have the right to access information on their cases—a constitutional right called the &quot;habeas data&quot; common in several Latin American countries. The rule is enforced retroactively. Chief Justice Puno stated that &quot;If you have this right, it would be very, very difficult for State agents, State authorities to be able to escape from their culpability.&quot;

The Resolution and the Rule on the Writ of Amparo gave legal birth to Puno&#x27;s brainchild. No filing or legal fees is required for Amparo which took effect on October 24, 2007. Puno also stated that the court will soon issue rules on the writ of habeas data and the implementing guidelines for Habeas Corpus. The petition for the writ of amparo may be filed &quot;on any day and at any time&quot; with the Regional Trial Court, or with the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. The interim reliefs under amparo are: temporary protection order (TPO), inspection order (IO), production order (PO), and witness protection order (WPO, RA 6981).

The Asian Human Rights Commission said that amparo and habeas data need to be complemented by laws to further protect human rights, since the writs in themselves are not enough to address torture, enforced disappearance, and extrajudicial killings, and do not include protection for non-witnesses.

On August 30, 2007, Puno vowed to institute the &quot;writ of habeas data&quot; as a new legal remedy to the extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. Puno explained that the &quot;writ of amparo&quot; denies to authorities defense of simple denial, and &quot;habeas data&quot; can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered.

On January 22, 2008, the Supreme Court en banc approved the rules for the writ of habeas data (&quot;to protect a person&#x27;s right to privacy and allow a person to control any information concerning them&quot;), effective on February 2, the Philippines&#x27; Constitution Day.

==Divisions==
The Court is authorized to sit either &quot;en banc&quot; or in divisions of three, five or seven members. Since 1987, the Court has divided itself into 3 divisions with 5 members each. A majority of the cases are heard and decided by the divisions, rather than the Court &quot;en banc&quot;. However, the Constitution requires that the Court hear &quot;en banc&quot; &quot;[a]ll cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international or executive agreement, as well as &quot;those involving the constitutionality, application, or operation of presidential decrees, proclamations, orders, instructions, ordinances, and other regulations&quot;. The Court &quot;en banc&quot; also decides cases originally heard by a division when a majority vote cannot be reached within the division. The Court also has the discretion to hear a case &quot;en banc&quot; even if no constitutional issue is involved, as it typically does if the decision would reverse precedent or presents novel or important questions.

Formerly under the 1935, 1973 and the 1986 Freedom Constitutions, the Court is authorized only to sit either &quot;en banc&quot; or in divisions of two.

On February 24, 2022, Alexander Gesmundo, the Chief Justice issued Special Order No. 2871 reorganised the Divisions of the Supreme Court, this was published on the same day and took effect immediately, With him as the Chairman of the First Division, and Associate Justice Hernando as its working chair, the other chairmanships were given to Senior Associate Justice Leonen (2nd Division) and Caguioa (3rd Division), this reorganization came immediately after the appointment of Justice Singh on May 18, 2022.

==Membership==
===Current justices===
The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and fourteen associate justices. Among the current members of the Court, Marvic Leonen is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of days () as of ; the most recent justice to enter the court is Maria Filomena Singh whose tenure began on .

===Judicial corruption===
On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, Philippines Social Weather Stations released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the judiciary; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the bribery, because they could not prove it. [Tables 8–9]; judges, however, said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10–11];b) &quot;Judges see some corruption; proportions who said – many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari&#x27;a Court judges, 4% to Sandiganbayan justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].

The September 14, 2008, Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) survey, ranked the Philippines 6th (6.10) among corrupt Asian judicial systems. PERC stated that &quot;despite India and the Philippines being democracies, expatriates did not look favourably on their judicial systems because of corruption.&quot; PERC reported Hong Kong and Singapore have the best judicial systems in Asia, with Indonesia and Vietnam the worst: Hong Kong&#x27;s judicial system scored 1.45 on the scale (zero representing the best performance and 10 the worst); Singapore with a grade of 1.92, followed by Japan (3.50), South Korea (4.62), Taiwan (4.93), the Philippines (6.10), Malaysia (6.47), India (6.50), Thailand (7.00), China (7.25), Vietnam&#x27;s (8.10) and Indonesia (8.26).&lt;

In 2014, Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (global survey ranking countries in terms of perceived corruption), the Philippines ranked 85th out of 175 countries surveyed, an improvement from placing 94th in 2013. It scored 38 on a scale of 1 to 100
in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).

The Philippines jumped nine places in the recently published World Justice Project (WJP) Rule of Law Index 2015, making it one of the most improved countries in terms of global rankings. It ranked 51st out of 102 countries on the ROLI, a significant jump from last year when the country ranked 60th out of 99 countries. This makes the Philippines the most improved among ASEAN member nations. &quot;Results showed that the country ranked high in terms of constraints on government powers (39th); absence of corruption (47th), and open government (50th).&quot;

&quot;The Philippines, however, fell to the bottom half of the global rankings in terms of regulatory enforcement (52nd); order and security (58th); criminal justice (66th); fundamental rights (67th), and civil justice (75th).&quot;

===&quot;Bantay Korte Suprema&quot;===
&quot;Watch the Supreme Court&quot; coalition was launched at the Training Center, Ground Floor, Supreme Court Centennial Bldg on November 17, 2008, &quot;to ensure the fair and honest selection of the 7 Associate Justices of the Supreme Court on 2009.&quot; Members of &quot;Bantay Korte Suprema&quot; include retired Philippine presidents, retired Supreme Court justices, legislators, legal practitioners, the academe, the business community and the media. former Senate President Jovito Salonga, UP Law Dean Marvic Leonen, Senate Majority Leader and Judicial and Bar Council member Kiko Pangilinan, the Philippine Bar Association, Artemio Panganiban, and Rodolfo Urbiztondo, of the 48,000-strong Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), and the chambers of commerce, witnessed the landmark event. BKS will neither select nor endorse a candidate, &quot;but if it receive information that makes a candidate incompetent, it will divulge this to the public and inform the JBC.&quot; At the BKS launching, the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the public monitoring of the selection of justices to the SC was signed.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Appointments Watch (SCAW) coalition of law groups and civil society to monitor the appointment of persons to judicial positions was also re-launched. The SCAW consortium, composed of the Alternative Law Groups, Libertas, Philippine Association of law Schools and the Transparency and Accountability Network, together with the online news magazine &quot;Newsbreak&quot;, reactivated itself for the JBC selection process of candidates.

<text>The butterfly theorem is a classical result in Euclidean geometry, which can be stated as follows:

Let be the midpoint of a chord of a circle, through which two other chords and are drawn; and intersect chord at and correspondingly. Then is the midpoint of .

==Proof==

A formal proof of the theorem is as follows:
Let the perpendiculars and be dropped from the point on the straight lines and respectively. Similarly, let and be dropped from the point perpendicular to the straight lines and respectively.

Since 
:: formula_1
: formula_2

:: formula_3
: formula_4

:: formula_5
: formula_6

:: formula_7
:formula_8

From the preceding equations and the intersecting chords theorem, it can be seen that

: formula_9

: formula_10

: formula_11

: formula_12

: formula_13

since .

So,

:formula_14

Cross-multiplying in the latter equation,

:formula_15

Cancelling the common term

:formula_16

from both sides of the equation yields

:formula_17

hence , since MX, MY, and PM are all positive, real numbers.

Thus, is the midpoint of .

Other proofs exist, including one using projective geometry.

==History==
Proving the butterfly theorem was posed as a problem by William Wallace in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Mathematical Companion&quot; (1803). Three solutions were published in 1804, and in 1805 Sir William Herschel posed the question again in a letter to Wallace. Reverend Thomas Scurr asked the same question again in 1814 in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Diary or Mathematical Repository&quot;.

<doc id="1335558" wikidata="Q5505241" url="?curid=1335558" title="Frog war">
<text>A frog war occurs when one private railway company attempts to cross the tracks of another, and this results in hostilities between the two railways. It is named after the frog, the piece of track that allows the two tracks to join or cross and is usually part of a level junction or railroad switch.

A frog war usually begins with legal actions, such as filing lawsuits and appealing to civic transportation authorities. But often the situation escalates into physical actions, with companies pitting their workers against one another with construction projects and train movements intended to frustrate or challenge the opposing railway.

==Division of costs==
It is generally the case that the second railway to arrive at an intended crossing has to bear the cost of the special trackwork needed to cross the first. This includes the cost of any interlocking tower or signal box. The latter is not necessarily to the disadvantage of the second railway, since it can signal its trains through the junction ahead of those belonging to the first railway, depending on who employs the signalman.

==&quot;Frog Wars&quot; with oil pipelines==
In the early days of the oil industry, most oil traveled by rail. As oil pipelines became more common, railway companies often saw them as threats to their business and refused to grant permission for pipelines to cross their tracks.

==Bridges and riverboats==
Abraham Lincoln participated in a celebrated court case that decided that railways had as much right to bridge rivers as the riverboat had the right to navigate those rivers. Nova Scotia&#x27;s Shubenacadie Canal was rendered useless by a railway bridge built across it in 1870.

==List of frog wars==
===Netherlands===
* 1845: A disgruntled property developer purchased Van der Gaag Lane, a short road south of Delft, with the intention of sabotaging the construction of the Haarlem-Hague Railway. After a deal to acquire the property on the owner&#x27;s own terms fell through, he vehemently refused to sell it or allow a crossing to be built, necessitating the circumvention of the property using a tight bend in the track.

===United States===
Note: The first railroad line built is the first one named.
* 1853: A feud between the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway and the Illinois Central Railroad led both railroads to run through Grand Crossing in Chicago as if the other railroad didn&#x27;t exist, finally resulting in a crash that killed 18 people.
* 1867: The South Carolina Railroad vs. the Columbia and Augusta Railroad (later the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad). A grade crossing in Columbia was protested in court, then blocked by a parked train, then physically torn up and finally threatened by a steamed-up locomotive ready to move forward to block at any moment (Derrick: 245-246 and Fetters: 143).
* 1870s: The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad vs. the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway vs. the Union Pacific. All three railroads contested one another for access through suitable mountain passes in Colorado.
* January 1870: Central Pacific Railroad vs. California Pacific Railroad. After Central Pacific blocked California Pacific from entering the city of Sacramento, California, the Supreme Court of California ordered otherwise.
* December 2, 1870–January 9, 1871: The Erie Railroad vs. the Morris &amp; Essex Railroad&#x27;s Boonton Branch (Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad) at the west end of the Erie&#x27;s Long Dock Tunnel in Jersey City, New Jersey.
* January 6 and January 7, 1876: The Mercer &amp; Somerset Railway (Pennsylvania Railroad) vs. the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad (Reading Railroad) in Hopewell, New Jersey.
* August 7–September 13, 1883: The Southern Pacific vs. the California Southern Railroad (a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway) at Colton Crossing in Colton, California (just outside San Bernardino).
* March 1886: The Erie Railroad vs. the New Jersey Junction Railroad (New York Central Railroad) at King&#x27;s Bluff near Weehawken, New Jersey.
* September 1891: The Central Railroad of New Jersey vs. the Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway (Lehigh Valley Railroad) in southern Jersey City, New Jersey.
* March 1894: The Cape May and Millville Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad) vs. the Tuckahoe and Cape May Railroad (Reading Railroad) at Woodbine Junction, New Jersey.
* 1897: The Pennsylvania Railroad vs. the New Jersey Junction Connecting Railway (Lehigh Valley Railroad) in Jersey City, New Jersey.
* December 1897: The Pennsylvania Railroad vs. the Newtown Electric Street Railway in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. This was not technically a frog war (since no grade crossing was involved), but the PRR opposed attempts to build a line through a turnpike underpass running underneath the PRR tracks. Passengers had to disembark on each side of the PRR and walk through the underpass to meet connecting trolleys.
* 1905: The Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad faced opposition from the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, and a standoff between workers, as well as a legal battle ensued between the two railroads.

===United Kingdom===
* Battle of Havant: Conflict between the London &amp; South Western Railway and the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway over the building of the Portsmouth branch.
* Nickey Line
* Conflict between the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway and the South Eastern Railway for access to Hastings and St Leonards beyond Bo Peep Junction.

<doc id="1335562" wikidata="Q545010" url="?curid=1335562" title="Centwine of Wessex">
<text>Centwine (died after 685) was King of Wessex from c. 676 to 685 or 686, although he was perhaps not the only king of the West Saxons at the time.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Centwine became king c. 676, succeeding Æscwine. Bede states that after the death of King Cenwalh: &quot;his under-rulers took upon them the kingdom of the people, and dividing it among themselves, held it ten years&quot;. Bede&#x27;s dismissal of Æscwine and Centwine as merely sub-kings may represent the views of the supporters of the King Ine, whose family ruled Wessex in Bede&#x27;s time. However, if the West Saxon kingdom did fragment following Cenwalh&#x27;s death, it appears that it was reunited during Centwine&#x27;s reign.

An entry under 682 in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that &quot;Centwine drove the Britons to the sea&quot;. This is the only event recorded in his reign. The &quot;Carmina Ecclesiastica&quot; of Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne (died 709), written a generation after Centwine&#x27;s reign, records that he won three great battles. In addition, it states that he was a pagan for part of his reign, adopting Christianity and becoming a patron of the church. The &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; version of his ancestry makes Centwine a son of King Cynegils, and thus a brother of King Cenwalh and maybe of Cwichelm, King of the Gewisse, but Aldhelm does not record any such relationship.

Chapter 40 of Eddius Stephanus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; records that Centwine was married to a sister of Queen Eormenburg, second wife of King Ecgfrith of Northumbria. Her name is not reliably recorded, and the suggestion that she is to be identified with Dunna, Abbess of Withington, is broadly rejected. Their daughter Bugga was certainly a nun when Aldhelm dedicated verses to her, and was probably an Abbess.

Centwine is reported to have abdicated and become a monk. Aldhelm writes that he &quot;gave up riches and the reins of government and left his own kingdom in the name of Christ&quot;. The date of his death is unknown. He was succeeded by Caedwalla.

<text>Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham (28 March 1850 – 11 June 1946) was a British colonial administrator who became the first Resident general of the Federated Malay States, which brought the Malay states of Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang together under the administration of a Resident-General based in Kuala Lumpur. He served from 1 July 1896 to 4 November 1901. He was also an amateur painter, photographer and antique collector.

== Early life ==
He was born in Belper, Derbyshire, the son of attorney James Oldham Swettenham, and Charlotte Elizabeth Carr and was educated at the Dollar Academy in Scotland and St Peter&#x27;s School, York. He was a descendant of Mathew Swetenham, Henry IV&#x27;s bow bearer, and the younger brother of the colonial administrator Sir James Alexander Swettenham.

==Career==

Swettenham was a British colonial official in British Malaya, who was famous as highly influential in shaping British policy and the structure of British administration in the Malay Peninsula.

In 1871 Swettenham was first sent to Singapore as a cadet in the civil service of the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Malacca, and Penang Island). He learned the Malay language and played a major role as British-Malay intermediary in the events surrounding British intervention in the peninsular Malay states in the 1870s.

He was a member of the Commission for the Pacification of Larut set up following the signing of the Pangkor Treaty of 1874 and he served alongside John Frederick Adolphus McNair, and Chinese Kapitan Chung Keng Quee and Chin Seng Yam. The commission was successful in freeing many women taken as captives during the Larut Wars (1862–73), getting stockades dismantled and getting the tin mining business going again.

More than a decade later, in 1882, he was appointed Resident (adviser) to the Malay state of Selangor. During his time in office in Selangor, he successfully promoted the development of coffee and tobacco estates and helped boost tin earnings by constructing a railway from Kuala Lumpur (it was capital of Selangor at that time), to the port of Klang, which was later named Port Swettenham in his honour.

He acquired the title of Resident-General after he secured an agreement of federation from the states of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang in 1895, when he was Resident of Perak state. In the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) by Queen Victoria, and in October 1901, three years before his retirement, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements.

Swettenham had long been critical of the influence of Siam in the northern Malay states of Kelantan and Trengganu, which had traditionally recognised the suzerainty of Siam by sending a tribute of a golden flower to the King of Siam every three years. After his appointment as Governor of the Straits Settlements, he attempted to negotiate with Siam for greater British influence over the affairs of these states. Siam reluctantly agreed to appoint British advisors, but only on the condition that they were appointed by Bangkok, not by the Foreign Office as he had hoped. However, the process had been initiated whereby these two states and eventually Kedah would eventually accept British Residents. Swettenham was disappointed in his ultimate goal of bringing the southern Thai region of Patani under British control.

He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union.

== Writings ==
Swettenham co-authored a &quot;A Dictionary of the Malay Language&quot; with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter &#x27;G&#x27; as by then it had been made redundant by the publication of R.J. Wilkinson&#x27;s &quot;A Malay English Dictionary&quot;.

He also published four books: &quot;Malay Sketches&quot;, &quot;Unaddressed Letters&quot;, &quot;Also &amp; Perhaps&quot; and &quot;Arabella in Africa&quot;, the last being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler. The book was Whistler&#x27;s first official commission.

==Personal life==

While on home leave in England in the summer of 1877, Swettenham met and became engaged to Constance Sydney Holmes (b. 1858), daughter of Cecil Frederick Holmes, a housemaster at Harrow School. They married in England in February 1878 and returned together to Singapore, where the nineteen-year old Sydney Swettenham attempted to come to terms with her new role as the wife of a colonial official. Their marriage, which was strained from the beginning and marked by long periods of separation, lasted until 1938, when Frank Swettenham successfully sued for divorce on the grounds of his wife&#x27;s insanity.

Swettenham became friends with Gertrude Bell when she visited Singapore in 1903 and maintained a correspondence with her until 1909. They are thought to have had a &quot;brief but passionate affair&quot; after his retirement to England.

Frank Swettenham remarried at the age of 89, this time to Vera Seton Guthrie (1890–1970) on 22 June 1939, daughter of John Gordon, a Scotch-American successful merchant and millionaire, and widow of John Neil Guthrie, who had been killed in action in France during World War I.

While in India in 1883 preparing for the Colonial Exhibition in Calcutta, Swettenham met and had a child with an Anglo-Indian woman from Bangalore (known only as Miss Good). To avoid a scandal, the mother of Swettenham&#x27;s son was married to an English clerk in the Perak civil service, Walter McKnight Young, and his son was raised as Walter Aynsley Young.

<text>Edwin Joseph O&#x27;Malley (August 22, 1881 – April 10, 1953) was the Commissioner of Public Markets for New York City.

==Biography==
Edwin O&#x27;Malley was born on August 22, 1881, in Manhattan, New York City, to Thomas Francis O&#x27;Malley (1854–1918) and Georgiana Reynolds (1855–1941). He married Alma Feltner (1883–1940) on January 16, 1902, and had one child, a son, Walter Francis O&#x27;Malley (1903–1979), who would become the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1950 to 1979, and who would oversee their controversial move from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.

In 1910, O&#x27;Malley was living in the Bronx, New York, and working as a cotton goods salesman. Around 1911 he moved the family from the Bronx to Hollis, Queens. He registered for the draft on September 12, 1918, but did not serve in World War I. He became a Democratic party ward heeler for Tammany Hall, and was appointed as the Commissioner of Public Markets for New York City by mayor John F. Hylan. He testified on August 18, 1922, before the Kings County, New York Grand Jury, which was investigating the mishandling of the fees paid by vendors to the Public Markets office. No charges were filed.

He died of a heart attack in Amityville, New York, on April 10, 1953, at age 71.

<doc id="1335588" wikidata="Q3630269" url="?curid=1335588" title="Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent">
<text>Buddhism, which originated in India, gradually dwindled starting in the 4th–6th century CE, and was replaced by Hinduism approximately the 12th century, in a centuries-long process. Lack of appeal among the rural masses, who instead embraced Hinduism formed in the Hindu synthesis, and dwindling financial support from trading communities and royal elites, were major factors in the decline of Buddhism.

The total Buddhist population in 2010 in the Indian subcontinent – excluding that of Sri Lanka, Bhutan (both Buddhist majority states), and Nepal – was about 10 million, of which about 92.5% in India, 7.2% lived in Bangladesh and 0.2% in Pakistan.

==Growth of Buddhism==
Buddhism expanded in the Indian subcontinent in the centuries after the death of the Buddha, particularly after receiving the endorsement and royal support of the Maurya Empire under Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. It spread even beyond the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia and China.

The Buddha&#x27;s period saw not only urbanisation, but also the beginnings of centralised states. The successful expansion of Buddhism depended on the growing economy of the time, together with an increase in the number of centralised political organisations capable of change.

Buddhism spread across ancient India and state support by various regional regimes continued through the 1st millennium BCE. The consolidation of monastic organisations made Buddhism the centre of religious and intellectual life in India. The succeeding Kanva Dynasty had four Buddhist Kanva Kings.

==Gupta Dynasty (4th–6th century)==

===Religious developments===
During the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th century), Vaishnavism, Shaivism and other Hindu religions became increasingly popular, while Brahmins developed a new relationship with the state. The differences between Buddhism and Hinduism blurred, as Mahayana Buddhism adopted more ritualistic practices, while Buddhist ideas were adopted into Vedic schools. As the system grew, Buddhist monasteries gradually lost control of land revenue. In parallel, the Gupta kings built Buddhist temples such as the one at Kushinagara, and monastic universities such as those at Nalanda, as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India.

===Hun invasions (6th century)===
Chinese scholars traveling through the region between the 5th and 8th centuries, such as Faxian, Xuanzang, Yijing, Hui-sheng, and Sung-Yun, began to speak of a decline of the Buddhist &quot;Sangha&quot; in the Northwestern parts of Indian subcontinent, especially in the wake of the Hun invasion from central Asia in the 6th century CE. Xuanzang wrote that numerous monasteries in north-western India had been reduced to ruins by the Huns.

The Hun ruler Mihirakula, who ruled from 515 CE in north-western region (modern Afghanistan, Pakistan and north India), suppressed Buddhism as well. He did this by destroying monasteries as far away as modern-day Prayagraj. Yashodharman and Gupta Empire rulers, in and after about 532 CE, reversed Mihirakula&#x27;s campaign and ended the Mihirakula era.

According to Peter Harvey, the religion recovered slowly from these invasions during the 7th century, with the &quot;Buddhism of Punjab and Sindh remaining strong&quot;. The reign of the Pala Dynasty (8th to 12th century) saw Buddhism in North India recover due to royal support from the Palas who supported various Buddhist centers like Nalanda. By the eleventh century, Pala rule had weakened, however.

==Socio-political change and religious competition==
The regionalisation of India after the end of the Gupta Empire (320–650 CE) led to the loss of patronage and donations. The prevailing view of decline of Buddhism in India is summed by A. L. Basham&#x27;s classic study which argues that the main cause was the rise of an ancient Hindu religion again, &quot;Hinduism&quot;, which focused on the worship of deities like Shiva and Vishnu and became more popular among the common people while Buddhism, being focused on monastery life, had become disconnected from public life and its life rituals, which were all left to Hindu Brahmins.

===Religious competition===
The growth of new forms of Hinduism (and to a lesser extent Jainism) was a key element in the decline in Buddhism in India, particularly in terms of diminishing financial support to Buddhist monasteries from laity and royalty and also not having any support of kings
. According to Kanai Hazra, Buddhism declined in part because of the rise of the Brahmins and their influence in socio-political process. According to Randall Collins, Richard Gombrich and other scholars, Buddhism&#x27;s rise or decline is not linked to Brahmins or the caste system, since Buddhism was &quot;not a reaction to the caste system&quot;, but aimed at the salvation of those who joined its monastic order.

The disintegration of central power also led to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry. Rural and devotional movements arose within Hinduism, along with Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, that competed with each other, as well as with numerous sects of Buddhism and Jainism. This fragmentation of power into feudal kingdoms was detrimental for Buddhism, as royal support shifted towards other communities and Brahmins developed a strong relationship with Indian states.

Over time the new Indian dynasties which arose after the 7th and 8th centuries tended to support Hinduism, and this conversion proved decisive. These new dynasties, all of which supported Hinduism, include &quot;the Karkotas and Pratiharas of the north, the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan, and the Pandyas and Pallavas of the south&quot; (the Pala Dynasty is one sole exception to these). One of the reasons of this conversion was that the Brahmins were willing and able to aid in local administration, and they provided councillors, administrators and clerical staff. Moreover, Brahmins had clear ideas about society, law and statecraft (and studied texts such as the Arthashastra and the Manusmriti) and could be more pragmatic than the Buddhists, whose religion was based on monastic renunciation and did not recognize that there was a special warrior class that was divinely ordained to use violence justly. As Johannes Bronkhorst notes, Buddhists could give &quot;very little&quot; practical advice in response to that of the Brahmins, and Buddhist texts often speak ill of kings and royalty.

Bronkhorst notes that some of the influence of the Brahmins derived from the fact that they were seen as powerful, because of their use of incantations and spells (mantras) as well as other sciences like astronomy, astrology, calendrics and divination. Many Buddhists refused to use such &quot;sciences&quot; and left them to Brahmins, who also performed most of the rituals of the Indian states (as well as in places like Cambodia and Burma).

Lars Fogelin argues that the concentration of the sangha into large monastic complexes like Nalanda was one of the contributing causes for the decline. He states that the Buddhists of these large monastic institutions became &quot;largely divorced from day-to-day interaction with the laity, except as landlords over increasingly large monastic properties&quot;. Padmanabh Jaini also notes that Buddhist laypersons are relatively neglected in the Buddhist literature, which produced only one text on lay life and not until the 11th century, while Jains produced around fifty texts on the life and conduct of a Jaina layperson.

These factors all slowly led to the replacement of Buddhism in the South and West of India by Hinduism and Jainism. Fogelin states that 
Buddhist sources also mention violence against Buddhists by Hindu Brahmins and kings. Hazra mentions that the eighth and ninth centuries saw &quot;Brahminical hostilities towards Buddhism in South India&quot;

===Religious convergence and absorption===
Buddhism&#x27;s distinctiveness also diminished with the rise of Hindu sects. Though Mahayana writers were quite critical of Hinduism, the devotional cults of Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism likely seemed quite similar to laity, and the developing Tantrism of both religions were also similar. Also, &quot;the increasingly esoteric nature&quot; of both Hindu and Buddhist tantrism made it &quot;incomprehensible to India&#x27;s masses&quot;, for whom Hindu devotionalism and the worldly power-oriented Nath Siddhas became a far better alternative. Buddhist ideas, and even the Buddha himself, were absorbed and adapted into orthodox Hindu thought, while the differences between the two systems of thought were emphasized.

Elements which medieval Hinduism adopted during this time included vegetarianism, a critique of animal sacrifices, a strong tradition of monasticism (founded by figures such as Shankara) and the adoption of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu. On the other end of the spectrum, Buddhism slowly became more and more &quot;Brahmanized&quot;, initially beginning with the adoption of Sanskrit as a means to defend their interests in royal courts. According to Bronkhorst, this move to the Sanskrit cultural world also brought with it numerous Brahmanical norms which now were adopted by the Sanskrit Buddhist culture (one example is the idea present in some Buddhist texts that the Buddha was a Brahmin who knew the Vedas). Bronkhorst notes that with time, even the caste system eventually became widely accepted for &quot;all practical purposes&quot; by Indian Buddhists (this survives among the Newar Buddhists of Nepal). Bronkhorst notes that eventually, a tendency developed in India to see Buddhism&#x27;s past as having been dependent on Brahmanism and secondary to it. This idea, according to Bronkhorst, &quot;may have acted like a Trojan horse, weakening this religion from within&quot;.

The political realities of the period also led some Buddhists to change their doctrines and practices. For example, some later texts such as the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra and the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra begin to speak of the importance of protecting Buddhist teachings and that killing is allowed if necessary for this reason. Later Buddhist literature also begins to see kings as bodhisattvas and their actions as being in line with the dharma (Buddhist kings like Devapala and Jayavarman VII also claimed this). Bronkhorst also thinks that the increase in the use of apotropaic rituals (including for the protection of the state and king) and spells (mantras) by 7th century Indian Buddhism is also a response to Brahmanical and Shaiva influence. These included fire sacrifices, which were performed under the rule of Buddhist king Dharmapala (r. c. 775–812). Alexis Sanderson has shown that Tantric Buddhism is filled with imperial imagery reflecting the realities of medieval India, and that in some ways work to sanctify that world. Perhaps because of these changes, Buddhism remained indebted to the crept in Brahmanical thought and practice now that it had adopted much of its world-view. Bronkhorst argues that these somewhat drastic changes &quot;took them far from the ideas and practices they had adhered to during the early centuries of their religion, and dangerously close to their much-detested rivals.&quot; These changes which brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism, eventually made it much easier for it to be absorbed into Hinduism and lose its separate identity for them.

===Patronage===
In ancient India, regardless of the religious beliefs of their kings, states usually treated all the important sects relatively even-handedly. This consisted of building monasteries and religious monuments, donating property such as the income of villages for the support of monks, and exempting donated property from taxation. Donations were most often made by private persons such as wealthy merchants and female relatives of the royal family, but there were periods when the state also gave its support and protection. In the case of Buddhism, this support was particularly important because of its high level of organisation and the reliance of monks on donations from the laity. State patronage of Buddhism took the form of land grant foundations.

Numerous copper plate inscriptions from India as well as Tibetan and Chinese texts suggest that the patronage of Buddhism and Buddhist monasteries in medieval India was interrupted in periods of war and political change, but broadly continued in Hindu kingdoms from the start of the common era through the early first millennium CE. The Gupta kings built Buddhist temples such as the one at Kushinagara, and monastic universities such as those at Nalanda, as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India.

===Internal social-economic dynamics===
According to some scholars such as Lars Fogelin, the decline of Buddhism may be related to economic reasons, wherein the Buddhist monasteries with large land grants focused on non-material pursuits, self-isolation of the monasteries, loss in internal discipline in the &quot;sangha&quot;, and a failure to efficiently operate the land they owned. With the growing support for Hinduism and Jainism, Buddhist monasteries also gradually lost control of land revenue.

==Turkic invasions and conquest (10th to 12th century)==

===Invasions===
According to Peter Harvey:

The Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent was the first great iconoclastic invasion into the Indian subcontinent. As early as the 8th century, Arab conquerors invaded present-day Pakistan. In a second wave, from the 11th through the 13th centuries, Turkic, Turkic-Mongolian and Mongolian overtook the northern Indian plains. The Persian traveller Al Biruni&#x27;s memoirs suggest Buddhism had vanished from Ghazni (Afghanistan) and medieval Punjab region (northern Pakistan) by early 11th century. By the end of the twelfth century, Buddhism had further disappeared, with the destruction of monasteries and stupas in medieval north-west and western Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and north India). The chronicler of Shahubuddin Ghori&#x27;s forces records enthusiastically about attacks on the monks and students and victory against the non-Muslims. The major centers of Buddhism were in north India and the direct path of the armies. As centers of wealth and non-Muslim religions they were targets. Buddhist sources agree with this assessment. Taranatha in his &quot;History of Buddhism in India&quot; of 1608, gives an account of the last few centuries of Buddhism, mainly in Eastern India. Mahayana Buddhism reached its zenith during the Pala dynasty period, a dynasty that ended with the Islamic invasion of the Gangetic plains.

According to William Johnston, hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and shrines were destroyed, Buddhist texts were burnt by the armies, monks and nuns killed during the 12th and 13th centuries in the Gangetic plains region. The Islamic invasions plundered wealth and destroyed Buddhist images.

The Buddhist university of Nalanda was mistaken for a fort because of the walled campus. The Buddhist monks who had been slaughtered were mistaken for Brahmins according to Minhaj-i-Siraj. The walled town, the Odantapuri monastery, was also conquered by his forces. Sumpa basing his account on that of Śākyaśrībhadra who was at Magadha in 1200, states that the Buddhist university complexes of Odantapuri and Vikramshila were also destroyed and the monks massacred. forces attacked the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent many times. Many places were destroyed and renamed. For example, Odantapuri&#x27;s monasteries were destroyed in 1197 by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji and the town was renamed. Likewise, Vikramashila was destroyed by the forces of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200. Many Buddhist monks fled to Nepal, Tibet, and South India to avoid the consequences of war. Tibetan pilgrim Chöjepal (1179–1264), who arrived in India in 1234, had to flee advancing troops multiple times, as they were sacking Buddhist sites.

The north-west parts of the Indian subcontinent fell to Islamic control, and the consequent take over of land holdings of Buddhist monasteries removed one source of necessary support for the Buddhists, while the economic upheaval and new taxes on laity sapped the laity support of Buddhist monks. Not all monasteries were destroyed by the invasions (Somapuri, Lalitagiri, Udayagiri), but since these large Buddhist monastic complexes had become dependent on the patronage of local authorities, when this patronage dissipated, they were abandoned by the sangha.

In the north-western parts of medieval India, the Himalayan regions, as well as regions bordering central Asia, Buddhism once facilitated trade relations, states Lars Fogelin. With the Islamic invasion and expansion, and central Asians adopting Islam, the trade route-derived financial support sources and the economic foundations of Buddhist monasteries declined, on which the survival and growth of Buddhism was based. The arrival of Islam removed the royal patronage to the monastic tradition of Buddhism, and the replacement of Buddhists in long-distance trade eroded the related sources of patronage.

===Decline under Islamic rule===
After the conquest, Buddhism largely disappeared from most of India, surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India. Abul Fazl stated that there was scarcely any trace of Buddhists left. When he visited Kashmir in 1597, he met with a few old men professing Buddhism, however, he &quot;saw none among the learned&quot;.

According to Randall Collins, Buddhism was already declining in India by the 12th century, but with the pillage by invaders it nearly became extinct in India in the 1200s. In the 13th century, states Craig Lockard, Buddhist monks in India escaped to Tibet to escape Islamic persecution; while the monks in western India, states Peter Harvey, escaped persecution by moving to south Indian Hindu kingdoms that were able to resist the power.

Brief accounts and the one eye-witness account of Dharmasmavim in wake of the conquest during the 1230s talk about abandoned viharas being used as camps by the Turukshahs. Later historical traditions such as Taranatha&#x27;s are mixed with legendary materials and summarised as &quot;the Turukshah conquered the whole of Magadha and destroyed many monasteries and did much damage at Nalanda, such that many monks fled abroad&quot; thereby bringing about a demise of Buddhism with their destruction of the Viharas.

While the sacked the Buddhists viharas, the temples and &quot;stupas&quot; with little material value survived. After the collapse of monastic Buddhism, Buddhist sites were abandoned or reoccupied by other religious orders. In the absence of viharas and libraries, scholastic Buddhism and its practitioners migrated to the Himalayas, China and Southeast Asia. The devastation of agriculture also meant that many laypersons were unable to support Buddhist monks, who were easily identifiable and also vulnerable. As the Sangha died out in numerous areas, it lacked the ability to revive itself without more monks to perform ordinations. Peter Harvey concludes:

Fogelin also notes that some elements of the Buddhist sangha moved to the Himalayas, China, and Southeast Asia, or they may have reverted to secular life or become wandering ascetics. In this environment, without monasteries and scholastic centers of their own, Buddhist ascetics and laypersons were eventually absorbed into the religious life of medieval India.

==Survival of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent==
Buddhist institutions survived in eastern India right until the Islamic invasion. Buddhism still survives among the Barua (though practising Vaishnavite elements), a community of Bengali Magadh descent who migrated to Chittagong region. Indian Buddhism also survives among Newars of Nepal, who practice unique form of Vajrayana known as Newar Buddhism and among the weavers of the villages of Maniabandha and Nuapatna in the Cuttack District of Odisha, a region that had been isolated for long.
In Bihar and Bengal, many Buddhist shrines and temples have remained intact with the Buddha or Bodhisattva inside being reappropriated and worshipped as a Brahmanical deity. Around the neighbourhood of Nalanda, the remains of votive stupas are worshipped as Shiva lingas. An image of the Buddha in bhūmisparśa mudrā at the village of Telhara receives full-fledged pūjā as Hanuman during Rama Navami. A sculpture of the Buddha has ended up as Vāsudeva at Gunaighar in Comilla.
While the Buddhist monastic centers like Nalanda had been sacked, the temples and &quot;stupas&quot; at pilgrimage sites (such as Bodh Gaya) didn&#x27;t receive the same treatment. The reason these were left unharmed was because they were &quot;not material legitimations of rival royal families&quot;. The last abbot of Bodh Gaya Mahavihara was Sariputra who was active during the 14th and 15th centuries before he left India for Nepal. Inscriptions at Bodh Gaya show that the Mahabodhi Temple was in some use till 14th century. According to the 17th century Tibetan Lama Taranatha&#x27;s &quot;History of Buddhism in India&quot;, the temple was restored by a Bengali queen in the 15th century, later passing on to a landowner and becoming a Shaivite center. Inscriptions at Bodh Gaya mention Buddhist pilgrims visiting it throughout the period of Buddhist decline:

* 1302–1331: Several groups from Sindh
* 15th or 16th century: a pilgrim from Multan
* 2nd half of the 15th century, monk Budhagupta from South India
* 16th century Abhayaraj from Nepal
* 1773 Trung Rampa, a representative of the Panchen Lama from Tibet, welcomed by Maharaja of Varanasi
* 1877, Burmese mission sent by King Mindon Min

Abul Fazl, the courtier of Mughal emperor Akbar, states, &quot;For a long time past scarce any trace of them (the Buddhists) has existed in Hindustan.&quot; When he visited Kashmir in 1597 he met with a few old men professing Buddhism, however, he &#x27;saw none among the learned&#x27;. This can also be seen from the fact that Buddhist priests were not present amidst learned divines that came to the Ibadat Khana of Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri.

After the Islamization of Kashmir by sultans like Sikandar Butshikan, much of Hinduism was gone and a little of Buddhism remained. Fazl writes, &quot;The third time that the writer accompanied His Majesty to the delightful valley of Kashmir, he met a few old men of this persuasion (Buddhism), but saw none among the learned.&quot;

&#x27;Abd al-Qadir Bada&#x27;uni mentions, &quot;Moreover samanis and Brahmans managed to get frequent private audiences with His Majesty.&quot; The term &quot;samani&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Sramana&quot; and Prakrit: &quot;Samana&quot;) refers to a devotee a monk. Irfan Habib states that while William Henry Lowe assumes the Samanis to be Buddhist monks, they were Jain ascetics.

Taranatha&#x27;s history which mentions Buddhist sangha surviving in some regions of India during his time which includes Konkana, Kalinga, Mewad, Chittor, Abu, Saurastra, Vindhya mountains, Ratnagiri, Karnataka etc. A Jain author Gunakirti (1450–1470) wrote a Marathi text, Dhamramrita, where he gives the names of 16 Buddhist orders. Dr. Johrapurkar noted that among them, the names Sataghare, Dongare, Navaghare, Kavishvar, Vasanik and Ichchhabhojanik still survive in Maharashtra as family names.

Buddhism survived in Gilgit and Baltistan until 13–14th century, perhaps slightly longer in the nearby Swat Valley. In Ladakh region, adjacent to Kashmir valley, Tibetan Buddhism survives to this day. The historic prevalence and history of Tibetan Buddhism in the above mentioned Northern regions of Jammu and Kashmir is reported in the Rajatarangini of Kalhana written in 1150/1 CE. It survived in the Kashmir Valley at least until the introduction of Islam in 1323 by the Ladakhi Rinchana, who as King of Kashmir converted to Islam, and even beyond, into the 15th century, when King Zain ul Abidin (1419–1470) had a Buddhist minister.

In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Buddhism survived until 15–16th century, as witnessed by the manuscript of the Manjusrimulakalpa. At Nagapattinam, in Tamil Nadu, Buddhist icons were cast and inscribed until this time, and the ruins of the Chudamani Vihara stood until they were destroyed by the Jesuits in 1867. In the South in some pockets, it may have survived even longer.

Buddhism was virtually extinct in British Raj by the end of the 19th century, except its Himalayan region, east and some niche locations. According to the 1901 census of British India, which included modern Bangladesh, India, Burma, and Pakistan, the total population was 294.4 million, of which total Buddhists were 9.5 million. Excluding Burma&#x27;s nearly 9.2 million Buddhists in 1901, this colonial-era census reported 0.3 million Buddhists in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan in the provinces, states and agencies of British India or about 0.1% of the total reported population.

The 1911 census reported a combined Buddhist population in British India, excluding Burma, of about 336,000 or about 0.1%.

==Revival==

In 1891, the Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) pioneering Buddhist activist Don David Hewavitarane later to known as Anagarika Dharmapala visited India. His campaign, in cooperation with American Theosophists such as Henry Steel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky, led to the revival of Buddhist pilgrimage sites along with the formation of the Maha Bodhi Society and Maha Bodhi Journal. His efforts increased awareness and raised funds to recover Buddhist holy sites in British India, such as the Bodh Gaya in India and those in Burma.

In the 1950s, B. R. Ambedkar pioneered the Dalit Buddhist movement in India for the Dalits (formerly referred to as &quot;untouchables&quot;). Dr. Ambedkar, on 14 October 1956 in Nagpur converted to Buddhism along with his 365,000 followers. Many other such mass-conversion ceremonies followed. Many converted employ the term &quot;Navayana&quot; (also known as &quot;Ambedkarite Buddhism&quot; or &quot;Neo Buddhism&quot;) to designate the Dalit Buddhist movement, which started with Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion. Now Marathi Buddhists are the largest Buddhist community in India.

In 1959, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, escaped from Tibet to India along with numerous Tibetan refugees, and set up the government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamshala, India, which is often referred to as &quot;Little Lhasa&quot;, after the Tibetan capital city. Tibetan exiles numbering several thousand have since settled in the town. Most of these exiles live in Upper Dharamsala, or McLeod Ganj, where they established monasteries, temples, and schools. The town has become one of the centres of Buddhism in the world.

In India, the most influential representative of Vipassana movement is the Vipassana Research Institute founded by S. N. Goenka (1924–2013) who promoted Buddhist Vipassanā Meditation in a modern and non-sectarian manner. This form of Buddhist meditation is mainly practiced by elite and middle class Indians, and the Vipassana movement has also spread to many other countries in Europe, America and Asia. In November 2008, the construction of the Global Vipassana Pagoda was completed on the outskirts of Mumbai. Ten-day Vipassanā meditation courses are regularly conducted free of charge at the Dhamma Pattana Meditation Centre that is part of the Global Vipassana Pagoda complex.

The Buddhist population in the modern era nation of India grew at a decadal rate of 22.5% between 1901 and 1981, due to birth rates and conversions, or about the same rate as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism, but faster than Christianity (16.8%), and slower than Islam (30.7%).

According to a 2010 Pew estimate, the total Buddhist population had increased to about 10 million in the nations created from British India. Of these, about 7.2% lived in Bangladesh, 92.5% in India and 0.2% in Pakistan.

Oklahoma City&#x27;s history begins with the settlement of &quot;unassigned lands&quot; in the region in the 1880s, and continues with the city&#x27;s development through statehood, World War I and the Oklahoma City bombing.

== Pre-settlement ==
Prior to the Land Rush of 1889, the territory Oklahoma City fell under was known as the &quot;Unassigned Lands&quot;, which were located just north of the Chickasaw Nation, and covered roughly 2950 square miles in central Oklahoma. The term &quot;Unassigned lands&quot; was first coined in 1879 by Elias C. Boudinot, a mixed-blood Cherokee Journalist, who believed that the territory should be open to white settlers.

This territory of Oklahoma was not inhabited by any of the displaced indigenous tribes from the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and was located in central Oklahoma, surrounded by the other claimed indigenous territories. The Cherokee Nation fell to the north, bound by the Cherokee Outlet. On the east, the Potawatomi, Shawnee, Sac and Fox, Pawnee, and Iowa reservations resided. Just south of the Unassigned lands, the Chickasaw Nation fell, and the Cheyenne Arapaho settlement fell to the west. The lands were crossed by five rivers, including &quot;the Canadian, the North Canadian, the Cimarron, the Deep Fork, and the Little&quot;, which provided natural borders, and a perfect combination of thin topsoil for grazing cattle, and rich bottomland soil for raising crops, thus making it greatly desired by white settlers who wanted to stake their claims to the inexpensive lands.

Prior to the opening of these Indigenous territories, the Boomer Movement saw forced raids and staked claims at sites in the unassigned lands, such as in present day Oklahoma City and Stillwater from 1879 to 1888. These raids, publicly led by David L. Payne and William Couch only saw brief success, and settled a town known as Ewing, present day Oklahoma City, in 1880. Despite this, were constantly overthrown and escorted out of the lands by U.S troops. However, they continued to enlist Boomers, and illegally made settlements in the Unassigned Lands and in the surrounding settlements until the Land Rush 1889.

== Early history (1889-1917) ==
Oklahoma City was officially opened to the public for settlement on April 22, 1889 with the Land Run and caused substantial settlement growth seemingly overnight. Oklahoma City was put under a provisional government, as the federal government did not expect the need to establish laws in the new territories, until the Organic Act that was passed under the Harrison Administration on May 2, 1890. This act applied the laws that were put in place for Nebraska to the newly settled Oklahoma Territory as a place holder until local governments could establish legislation. Oklahoma City was officially incorporated as the county seat for the second of the seven Oklahoma counties, with Guthrie, Oklahoma as the capital.

The first provisional Mayor of Oklahoma City was William Couch, one of the leaders of the previous Boomer movement, who resigned in 1889. Couch passed the title on to Sidney Clarke on November 11, 1889 with his resignation. Clarke held the title of provisional mayor of Oklahoma City until an official election could be held on November 27, 1889, making Andrew Jackson Beale the mayor until the first nonprovisional mayor, William James Gault, was elected in 1890.

With Guthrie, Oklahoma as the state capital, tensions began to rise between the two cities as high profile Oklahoman politicians, including Governor Charles N. Haskell, advocated for Oklahoma City to receive the title of state capital instead. This rivalry continued until, by popular vote, Oklahoma City was made the official capital of Oklahoma on June 11, 1910. Speculations among Guthrie civic leaders claimed that an unknown Oklahoma City booster allegedly spirited the state seal way from the Guthrie state capital in the night to ensure the title transfer. Oklahoma City continues to hold the title of Oklahoma&#x27;s Capital into present day, with the Oklahoma State Capitol established at N.E 23rd street and Lincoln Boulevard in 1917.

=== City leaders ===
City leaders of this new capital included John Wilford Shartel, Anton H. Classen, James W. Maney, and Henry Overholser, who vastly transformed the infrastructure of the city, by providing better housing accommodations, efficient public transportation, public entertainment, and a railroad system. These city leaders set the blueprint for the upcoming economic development in later decades.

Overholser was a prominent early settler who emphasized his desire for public entertainment with his contributions to the city&#x27;s infrastructure. Overholser created the Grand Avenue Hotel in 1889, the Overholser Opera House along with the Overholser theater in 1890, and assisted in the purchase of permanent fair grounds for the Oklahoma State Fair in 1906.

Classen, prior to creating the Metropolitan Railway Company with John Shartel (later the Oklahoma City Railway Company), was appointed as receiver in the U.S land office in Oklahoma City by president William McKinley in 1897. Classen focused his efforts on inner-city beautification and infrastructure improvements, becoming president of both the Oklahoma City Building and Loan Association and the Oklahoma City Commercial Club in 1899.

Classen worked closely with Shartel to add numerous housing divisions to accommodate the growing population, the first being the Highland Parks Addition in 1900. Along with this, &quot;he was instrumental in getting city streets paved, in organizing Oklahoma City street fairs, and in promoting Oklahoma City as the location for Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders annual reunion in 1900&quot;. Shartel and Classen collaborated once again in 1902 with the creation of the Metropolitan Railroad Company, which created an efficient mass-transport system for downtown Oklahoma City. Classen was also responsible for organizing the University Development Company, and financed Epworth University (Now known as Oklahoma City University) which was officially established in 1904.

Aside from his collaborations with Anton Classen, John Shartel bought twenty acres of land located at modern day 7th and 10th street, which became known as the Florence Addition. Prior to Classen&#x27;s death in 1922, Shartel served as the Vice President on the Oklahoma City Building and Loan Association and the Oklahoma City Commercial Club, and overtook the position of president after Classen&#x27;s death.

James W. Maney also focused his efforts on creating a railroad system in Oklahoma City, and gained the reputation of &quot;the largest railroad contractor in Oklahoma&quot; by 1900. Maney built the second railroad into Oklahoma City, when the territory opened in 1889, and then worked closely with Classen and Olverhoser to focus on the growth and development in Oklahoma City. Maney&#x27;s legacy is sealed by the historic Maney House, the mansion he resided in until is death in 1945, that is now used as a bed and breakfast.

==Pre World War II==
The new city continued to grow at a steady rate until December 4, 1928, when oil was discovered in the city. Oil wells popped up everywhere, even on the south lawn on the capitol building, and the sudden influx of oil money within the city and throughout the state greatly accelerated the city&#x27;s growth. While those who had made money during this early oil boom largely escaped the Depression, the majority of Americans and Oklahomans were not so lucky. By 1935, rural migrants and unemployed workers had built a massive shanty town (or &quot;Hooverville&quot; after president Herbert Hoover) on the south bank of the North Canadian River. The river often flooded, bringing disease and misery to the people living there. As part of the &quot;New Deal&quot;, the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps greatly reduced the level of the river to prevent flooding (a move which would later become a problem for city leaders stuck with a nearly empty river) and built one of the first experiments with public housing in the country.

A municipal-owned Elm Grove camp built in 1932 and which offered better amenities to residents who paid $1 a day or donated eight hours or labor. The camp was eliminated in 1933 because of a fear that it would attract more homeless residents to the city. A May Avenue Camp continued to exist in 1939. In 1933, the city planning commission recommended a policy restricting African Americans&#x27; ability to stay in white residential areas within the city (see sundown town).

==Postwar developments==
The Second World War and the growing war industries brought recovery to the nation and Oklahoma City, and the post war period saw Oklahoma City become a major hub in the national Interstate Highway System. Additionally, Tinker Air Force Base in Midwest City became the largest air depot in the country in the post war period, a fact which made Oklahoma City the likely target for a possible Soviet nuclear strike. As the civil rights era dawned, downtown Oklahoma City became the site of a revolution in civil rights tactics. History teacher Clara Luper and some of her students from nearby Douglass High School led the first &quot;sit-in&quot; in American history to desegregate the lunch counter at a downtown department store in 1958. When they succeeded, the tactic was adopted throughout the country, notably by the young activists of SNCC.

With the support of Stanley Draper and the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, the city government launched a &quot;Great Annexation Drive&quot; in 1959, quintupling Oklahoma City&#x27;s legal boundaries from to in just over two years. Draper was concerned that Oklahoma City&#x27;s peripheral cities and towns might block future urban developments and dominate city facilities, hampering long-range planning. He believed that annexation would allow the city to grow to provide the facilities industry required but which the surrounding communities did not have the resources to support. By the end of 1961, Oklahoma City had overtaken Los Angeles as the largest U.S. city by land mass. The annexation policy led to ballooning costs for services such as fire and police departments, roads, and lighting. In a 1965 special election, the Oklahoma City voters approved a sales tax by a margin of more than 2-1 to raise funds for expanding services.

From February 3 to July 29, 1964, Oklahoma City was subjected to eight sonic booms per day in a controversial experiment known as the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests. The intent was to quantify the sociological and economic costs of a supersonic transport aircraft. The experiment resulted in 15,400 damage claims. The persistence of the experiment and the 94% rejection rate of damage claims led to turmoil at all levels of government and embroiled Senator Mike Monroney&#x27;s office in a battle with the Federal Aviation Administration. The embarrassment over the Oklahoma City experiments partially contributed to the demise of the Boeing 2707 SST project seven years later.

==Decline and stagnation==
As the 1960s continued, however, Oklahoma City began to decline. By 1970, &quot;white flight&quot; and suburbanization had drained the life from the central business district and the surrounding areas. The oil beneath the city had begun to dry up, and property values declined. The city leaders then engaged in a disastrous program of &quot;urban renewal&quot; which succeeded primarily in demolishing much of the aging theater district. Despite popular conjecture, the impressive Biltmore Hotel was not originally targeted to be taken down by the Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority. Plans drawn up for downtown&#x27;s redevelopment by I.M. Pei always assumed the building would remain open for business. After a $3 million renovation in the mid-1960s, the hotel was renamed the Sheraton-Oklahoma Hotel. But, the operation could not turn a profit, and in 1973, hotel owners agreed with the authority the building had outlived its useful life and needed to be demolished. The city had planned to build a massive shopping mall called &quot;The Galleria&quot; downtown, but money for renewal ran out before they could construct more than the parking garage for it. This left downtown Oklahoma City in even worse shape than it had been in, with vacant lots where Victorian brownstones once stood. The 1970s and 1980s were periods of stagnation for Oklahoma City proper (and was the case for almost all major cities in the United States) and periods of affluence and explosive development for the suburbs. With the exception of The Myriad Gardens, little was done to improve the inner city or the central business district during this time, even as the oil boom of the late 1970s brought a flood of money into the area.

==1990s==
By 1992, the city was in such dire need of improvement that it was losing jobs, population, and even air carriers to more attractive cities. With this in mind, Mayor Ron Norick pushed through a massive plan for capital improvements throughout downtown called the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan, or MAPS. MAPS called for a five-year, one-cent sales tax to fund a new ballpark, a canal through Bricktown, a new central library, a large indoor arena, renovations to the fairgrounds and the civic center, and a series of low water dams on the North Canadian River to make it attractive and accessible to small boats. Though still stinging from the failure of &quot;urban renewal&quot;, the people of Oklahoma City passed the measure, eventually raising over 1 billion dollars for improvements to the city and bringing life back to the central city.

===Oklahoma City bombing===
In the midst of this atmosphere of optimism and change, Timothy McVeigh drove a rented truck full of explosives to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. The explosion killed 168 people (including 19 children) and injured more than 680, as well as damaging and destroying many surrounding buildings. Until the attacks of September 11, it was the largest terrorist attack on American soil, and it remains the single largest domestic terrorist attack in American history.

The site is now home to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The memorial was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer, and Sven Berg and was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Oklahoma City has since rebuilt, and except for the memorial, there is little evidence of the bombing.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation led an investigation, known as OKBOMB, the largest criminal case in America&#x27;s history (FBI agents conducted 28,000 interviews, amassed of evidence, and collected nearly one billion pieces of information). Special Agent in Charge Weldon L. Kennedy. commanded the largest crime task force since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The task force included 300 FBI agents, 200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 125 members of the Oklahoma National Guard, and 55 officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.

==21st Century==

As Oklahoma City moves through the 21st century, new changes continue to bring population, jobs, entertainment, and improvement. In 2004, a new Dell call center brought over 250 jobs, and plans to employ over 19,000 more jobs in the future. 2005 brought Oklahoma its first major league basketball franchise, the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, followed by becoming the permanent home of the renamed Seattle NBA franchise, now the Oklahoma City Thunder, in 2008. Many other corporations are making Oklahoma City their home and the population is once again increasing at a very high rate. Also, a new addition to the downtown skyline, Devon Energy Center, was completed in 2012, with 52 stories and a height of 850 feet.
