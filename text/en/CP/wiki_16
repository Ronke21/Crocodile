<doc id="1318771" wikidata="Q1139602" url="?curid=1318771" title="Eli Broad">
<text>Eli Broad ( ; June 6, 1933April 30, 2021) was an American businessman and philanthropist. In June 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him as the 233rd-wealthiest person in the world and the 78th-wealthiest in the United States, with an estimated net worth of $6.7 billion. He was known for his philanthropic commitment to transforming public K–12 education to a charter school model, scientific and medical research, and the visual and performing arts.

==Early life==
Broad was born on June 6, 1933, in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Rebecca (Jacobson) and Leo Broad, Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who met in New York. His father worked as a house painter, and his mother as a dressmaker. His family moved to Detroit, Michigan, when he was six years old. In Detroit, his father was a union organizer and owned five-and-dime stores. Broad attended Detroit Public Schools and graduated from Detroit Central High School in 1951.

Broad attended Michigan State University, majoring in accounting with a minor in economics and graduating &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1954. Among the jobs Broad held in college were selling women&#x27;s shoes, selling garbage disposals door-to-door, and working as a drill press operator at Packard Motor, where he was a member of United Auto Workers. The same year, 21-year-old Broad married 18-year-old Edythe &quot;Edye&quot; Lawson.

Broad became the youngest Michigan resident to attain the credentials of Certified Public Accountant (CPA), a record he held until 2010. Broad worked as an accountant for two years and taught night classes at the Detroit Institute of Technology as an assistant professor of accounting in 1956. Wanting to work on his own, he founded his own accounting firm and was offered office space by the husband of his wife&#x27;s cousin, Donald Bruce Kaufman, in return for doing the books for Kaufman&#x27;s small homebuilding and subcontracting business.

==Career==
===Kaufman &amp; Broad===
Doing the accounting for Kaufman&#x27;s small business led Broad to decide to enter homebuilding himself. In 1956, Broad and Kaufman decided to partner and build homes together. Borrowing $12,500 from his wife&#x27;s parents, Broad put up half the capital in their first venture together, building two model homes in the Northeast Detroit suburbs where a new generation of first-time home buyers were flocking. By streamlining the construction process and eliminating basements, offering a carport instead, they could price the houses so the monthly mortgage would be less than the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. Kaufman and Broad named this model the &quot;Award Winner&quot; and priced it at $13,700. After one weekend, seventeen were sold and within two years, Kaufman and Broad had built 600 homes in the Detroit suburbs. In 1960, fearing that the Detroit economy was too dependent on the automotive business, they moved to Phoenix, Arizona. In 1961, Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation (now KB Home) went public on the American Stock Exchange. In 1963, Broad moved the company to Los Angeles. Soon after, Kaufman retired and he and his wife Glorya Kaufman went on to become noted philanthropists. By 1969, KB Home was the first homebuilder listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1974, Broad stepped down as CEO.

===SunAmerica===
In 1971, Broad acquired Sun Life Insurance Company of America, a family-owned insurance company founded in Baltimore in 1890, for $52 million. Broad transformed Sun Life into the retirement savings powerhouse SunAmerica. SunAmerica went public in 1989, with a remaining share of 42% for Broad. In 1998, he sold SunAmerica to the American International Group (AIG) for $17.8 billion after three weeks of secret negotiations. Broad continued as CEO of SunAmerica until 1999, when he left to focus on philanthropy full-time.

===Writing===
In 2012, Broad&#x27;s book, &quot;The Art of Being Unreasonable: Lessons in Unconventional Thinking&quot;, was published by Wiley and Sons and debuted as a &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Washington Post&quot; bestseller.

In June 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an op-ed authored by Broad advocating for a wealth tax.

==Philanthropy and civic engagement==
Eli and Edythe Broad created the Broad Foundations, which include the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation and the Broad Art Foundation. These organizations have assets of $2.5 billion.

In the same year as its founding in 2010, the Broads signed onto the Giving Pledge, a commitment for wealthy individuals to give at least half of their wealth to charity. The Broads personally committed to giving 75% of their wealth away. As of October 2017, the Broads had given more than $4 billion to support K-12 public schools, advance scientific and medical research, and bring contemporary art to as wide an audience as possible.

In 2017, Broad announced his retirement from the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, passing responsibility to its president, Gerun Riley. Broad said he would remain as a trustee of the foundation, and continue to serve on the board of the Broad Museum. Broad said he was in good health and felt like it was time to &quot;step back&quot;.

===Education===
The stated mission of the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation&#x27;s education work is to expand learning opportunities to students from underserved communities so they can reach their full potential. The foundation has made $650 million in grants since it launched in 1999. In 2001, Broad founded the Broad Center, a nonprofit focused on developing school system leaders.

====The Broad Prize====
From 2002 to 2014, the Broad Foundation awarded an annual $1 million Broad Prize for Urban Education. The Broad Prize recognized the large urban school districts in America that have made the greatest improvement in student achievement while narrowing achievement gaps among low-income students and students of color. In 2012, the foundation launched the Broad Prize for Public Charter Schools, which awarded $250,000 to the top charter management organization in the country. Over the course of 17 years, prize money totaling nearly $18 million went to support college scholarships and college readiness programs. Both prizes were officially sunsetted in 2019.

====The Broad Center====
The Broad Center identifies, develops, and supports outstanding leaders who are inspired to work towards transforming public education into an engine of excellence and equity. The nonprofit includes two highly selective professional development programs, the Broad Academy and the Broad Residency in Urban Education. The Broad Academy supports current and aspiring superintendents of urban public school districts, public charter school networks, and state departments of education as they work to grow their organizations&#x27; effectiveness and increase their impact. The Broad Residency in Urban Education is a two-year program that matches early- to mid-career professionals with management roles in urban public school systems while earning an accredited masters in education.

====Charter schools====
In 2015, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; obtained a secret 44-page proposal drafted by the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation and other charter advocates that was designed to charterize 50% of Los Angeles public schools. The result was the creation of Great Public Schools Now, a nonprofit organization.

===Arts===
Broad was the founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 1979 and chaired the board until 1984. He recruited the founding director of the museum and negotiated the acquisition of the Panza Collection for the museum.

In 2008, the Broad Foundation donated $30 million to the museum. The foundation&#x27;s donation was contingent on the museum remaining independent and not merging with Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Broad was a life trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). In 2003, the Broad Foundation gave $60 million to the museum as part of its renovation campaign to create the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and for an art acquisition fund.

The Broads donated $6 million to the Los Angeles Opera to bring Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; to Los Angeles for the 2009–10 season. In June 2013, the Broads gave $7 million to continue funding the Eli and Edythe Broad general director at L.A. Opera, a position occupied by Plácido Domingo until his resignation from the post in 2019.

The Broads contributed $10 million in 2008 for a programming endowment for a music and performing arts center at Santa Monica College, the Eli and Edythe Broad Stage, and an adjacent black box performance space, the Edye.

In total, the Broads have pledged roughly $1 billion to Los Angeles art institutions. Broad called Los Angeles a &quot;cultural capital of the world&quot;.

====The Broad====
In August 2010, Eli Broad announced that he would build a contemporary art museum in Los Angeles. Diller Scofidio + Renfro were chosen through an architectural competition to design the approximately 120,000-square-foot museum, which includes exhibition space, offices, and a parking garage.

In February 2015, a public preview of a special installation attracted some 3,500 visitors while the museum was still under construction. The Broad was opened by the Broads on Sunday, September 20, 2015. To date, it has received more than 2.5 million visitors.

====Grand Avenue project====
In 2000, Broad founded the Grand Avenue Committee, which coordinated and oversaw further development of Grand Avenue in Los Angeles. He was involved in the fundraising campaign to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which opened in October 2003. Broad was instrumental in securing the $50 million deposit from the project developer, Related Companies, that opened Grand Park in summer 2012.


====Higher education philanthropic work====
Broad&#x27;s first civic board membership and significant investment in education was a $10 million commitment to Pitzer College in 1970. In 1973, he was named chairman of the board of the educational institution.

In 1991, Broad endowed the Eli Broad College of Business and the Eli Broad Graduate School of Management with $20 million for a full-time MBA program at his alma mater, Michigan State University (MSU). The Broads gave $5 million to endow the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Dean of Business Chair.

In 2000, Broad gave $23.2 million for the Broad Art Center at UCLA, designed by Richard Meier. Eli and Edythe Broad donated $28 million to MSU for the construction of the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid. The museum opened in November 2012. In 2014, the Broad Foundation announced a $5 million gift to the Broad Art Museum at MSU to support exhibitions. That same year, the Broads also announced a $25 million grant to expand the Eli Broad College of Business, bringing the couples total giving to MSU to nearly $100 million.

===Scientific and medical research===
The Broad Foundation&#x27;s first major investment in scientific and medical research was in the field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since then, the foundation has expanded its scope to focus on genomics and stem cell research.

In 2001, the Broads created the Broad Medical Research Program to fund innovative research to advance the treatment of IBD. The program was merged with the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of America in 2013.

In 2003, Eli and Edythe Broad gave the $100 million founding gift to create the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which aims to improve human health by using genomics to advance the understanding of the biology of human disease and lay the groundwork for a new generation of therapies. The following year, they gave another $100 million, and in 2009, they gave another $400 million to create an endowment and make the institute an independent nonprofit. In 2013, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the institute. The Broad Institute now connects more than 4,000 scientists with an annual budget of more than $400 million.

The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the University of Southern California (USC) is the product of a public-private partnership between the voter-created California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, which donated $30 million in 2006. In 2007, the Broads also donated $20 million to the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). One year later, they gave a major gift to the University of California, San Francisco for the new headquarters of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, which opened in February 2011.

Eli Broad was also a life member of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Board of Trustees where he funded the Broad Center for the Biological Sciences. In 2009, the Broads gave $5 million to fund the Joint Center for Translational Medicine at Caltech and UCLA. In 2018, the Broads pledged $5 million to Caltech to endow a professorial chair in honor of Caltech President Emeritus David Baltimore.

===Gun control ===
Starting in 2009, the Broad Foundation funded research on firearm violence and loopholes in gun-safety laws at the Violence Prevention Research Program at the UC Davis School of Medicine and Medical Center. In August 2013, Broad donated $250,000 to oppose the recalls of the President of the Colorado Senate John Morse and Senator Angela Giron, who were being recalled for their support of gun control measures, including a ban on magazines of 15 rounds or more. Broad served on the advisory committee for gun control group Everytown For Gun Safety when it launched in 2014. In 2018, he pledged $1 million to the group.

==Art collection==

Eli Broad was drawn into the art world by his wife Edythe&#x27;s interest in collecting. Their first major purchase was made in 1973, when he and Edye first acquired a Van Gogh drawing entitled &quot;Cabanes a Saintes-Maries&quot;, 1888. Art collector and MCA executive Taft Schreiber became their mentor. The Broads&#x27; early acquisitions included notable works by Miró, Picasso, and Matisse. Eventually, the pair began to concentrate on post–World War II art.

Eli and Edythe Broad established the Broad Art Foundation in 1984 with the goal of making their extensive contemporary art collection more accessible to the public.

The Broads have two collections focusing on postwar and contemporary art—a personal collection with nearly 600 works and the Broad Art Foundation&#x27;s collection, which has approximately 1,500 works. About 40% of their collection was bought via dealer Larry Gagosian.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, the Broads commissioned Frank O. Gehry to design their primary residence in Brentwood. It was built by the architecture firm Langdon Wilson based on Gehry&#x27;s initial designs.

In the late 1990s, Broad paid $5.65 million for two parcels in Malibu and commissioned Richard Meier to design a waterfront home of roughly , which was completed in 2002. Two months after Broad&#x27;s death, the home sold for $51.65 million.

Broad died on April 30, 2021, at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California after a long illness, at age 87.

==Honors and awards==
Broad was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1994 was named Chevalier in the National Order of the Legion of Honor by the Republic of France. In 1998, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. From 2004 to 2009, he served as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He received the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2007 and the David Rockefeller Award from the Museum of Modern Art in March 2009. In October 2013, the Broads were awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership by Philanthropy Roundtable. Broad served on the board of the Future Generation Art Prize. He was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in 2016. In 2018, Broad and his wife were named Distinguished Philanthropists at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. In the same year, they received the American Federation of the Arts Cultural Leadership award. In 2019, they received honorary degrees from the University of Southern California.

<doc id="1318778" wikidata="Q649683" url="?curid=1318778" title="W Juliet">
<text>is a shōjo romantic comedy manga series by Emura. It was published by Hakusensha in &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; between 1997 and 2002 and collected in 14 bound volumes. It is about the relationship between tomboy Ito Miura and the feminine Makoto Amano who share the common dream of becoming actors, as they work together to hide Makoto&#x27;s secret identity as a boy. It is licensed in English by Viz Media. A sequel series, &quot;W Juliet II&quot;, is ongoing in &quot;The Hana to Yume&quot;, and collected in four volumes as of February 2015.

The title comes from the Japanese adoption of the letter &quot;W&quot; as a character meaning &quot;double&quot;, so the title &quot;W Juliet&quot; means &quot;Two Juliets&quot;. Two Juliets is the theme and conflict in the first chapter, during which the drama club puts on a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with Ito and Makoto in the title roles.

==Plot==

At the start of the series, Ito Miura meets the beautiful transfer student Makoto Amano, and the girls become instant friends. Their personalities are completely different—Makoto is calm, quiet, and beautifully feminine, while Ito speaks, dresses, and behaves like a boy—but they share the same dream: becoming an actor. As soon as Makoto gets on stage at the drama club, it is clear she has talent, enough so she is cast as Juliet in the upcoming production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, opposite Ito as Romeo. However, Makoto has a rival for the role in Tsugumi Nomura, an upperclassman who is obsessed with the boyish Ito. Worse, Ito learns Makoto&#x27;s secret: &quot;she&quot; is actually a &quot;he&quot;. Makoto&#x27;s strict father wants him to inherit the family dojo, and made a bet with his son—if Makoto shows he has the skill to pose as a female for his last two years of high school, he can become an actor as he wishes, but if anyone discovers his gender, he must stay home and accept the dojo. Ito agrees to keep Makoto&#x27;s secret so that he could continue with his dream.

The series follows Ito and Makoto during their last two years of high school, as they work to improve their acting and keep Makoto&#x27;s secret. They start out just as friends, but continue as boyfriend and girlfriend. One of the obstacles they must face is keeping their relationship a secret from their family and friends, both because of Makoto&#x27;s assumed gender and it would expose his secret. They must also worry about Makoto&#x27;s jealous arranged fiancée, Takayo, and her brother, who has a strong sister complex, and Ito&#x27;s various suitors. All the while, the drama club performs various plays, some of which are essential to demonstrating Makoto&#x27;s acting skill to his father. 

==Characters==

The Japanese long &#x27;o&#x27; and long &#x27;u&#x27; are transliterated as &#x27;ô&#x27; and &#x27;û&#x27; in the Viz Media English language release.

=== Main characters ===
: A 17-year-old tomboy, Ito is the only girl in a family with three brothers and her father. She started wearing boys&#x27; clothes, as well as adopting a boyish haircut, after her mother was killed in a car accident when she was six. In volume 10, she explains she did so to avoid needing her brothers&#x27; protection from the bullying of a classmate named Jotaro. Ito is idolized by many girls at school, and she is known for being mobbed on Valentine&#x27;s Day despite being a girl. She is the female president of the school drama club. As an actor, Ito is more noted for her charisma and physical ability, rather than her considerable technical skills. She is rather headstrong and often reacts to situations without thinking things through. She is depicted as not being a good cook, although according to an author&#x27;s note, she is good at &quot;cooking for a crowd.&quot; When Ito discovers that Makoto is a boy, she decides to help him and eventually falls in love with him. As the series progresses, Ito starts adopting more feminine habits to be the perfect girl for Makoto, at first unconsciously but then consciously. She still however retains some of her boyish mannerisms, specifically her extrovert liveliness.
: During the series, Ito has several admirers aside from Makoto. These include Toki-senpai, a former drama club member now in college, who wants Ito to be more feminine; Tsugumi-senpai, a year ahead of Ito, who is obsessed with Ito&#x27;s boyish side, going so far as to call her &quot;Ito-kun,&quot; using a primarily male suffix (see &quot;Japanese honorifics&quot;); and Sakamoto, a &quot;masochist&quot; who likes both Ito and Makoto. In volume 10, Ito meets Jotaro again and he confesses that he teased her because he liked her. Ito rejects him, as she had once liked him, telling him that she is already in love with someone else.
: In volume 13 they audition for a troupe of actors. A key test is what they improvise for a situation: the test-actor comes home and finds a robber in his/her home. Makoto wraps a sash around his waist and performs it as a female ghost who invites the robber to eternal rest. Ito follows Makoto, and performs it as a guy, who belittles the robber as an amateur. Do you think you could rob a professional? Then proceeds to beat up the other actor, and gets out of hand and breaks the judges&#x27; table. When results are posted Makoto and the actor #12 are accepted. As Ito declares that she will audition with other troupes someone they know, Jotaro&#x27;s father, comes up and congratulates both of them, both accepted. Ito had been accepted solely on the decision of director Igarashi, &quot;Because you&#x27;re an idiot!&quot;. Everyone agreed that nobody got into their role quite so much as Ito had, and that her skills can be polished.
: Ito&#x27;s name () means &quot;thread,&quot; which in the story comes from her father&#x27;s wish for a name that is &quot;slender and pretty&quot; and her mother&#x27;s wish for a name that &quot;can be used to make something.&quot; Though Makoto&#x27;s father considers her name a bad omen, as &quot;a breaking thread,&quot; she considers it a blessing and a symbol of her creativity.
: At age 17, Makoto Narita made a deal: to convince his father he had both the talent and determination to become an actor, Makoto is to spend his last two years of high school as a girl. If anyone finds out, Makoto will stay home and inherit his father&#x27;s dojo. With the help of his sister, Akane, Makoto transforms himself into a girl and transfers to a new school as Makoto Amano. There, he meets and quickly befriends Ito, who has an opposite personality but shares his love of the theater. As actors, too, they complement each other, with Makoto having the greater technical skill but Ito more charisma. When Ito discovers Makoto&#x27;s identity, she decides to help him keep his secret. At first, Makoto tries to hide his feelings for Ito but soon shows he is falling in love with her.
: Makoto is quite skilled, able to cook, clean, do makeup, and select clothing, and is able to pick up new abilities quickly, such as juggling. He is more subtle and observant, able to handle delicate situations with more tact and skill, than the gung-ho Ito. However, he is also introverted and prone to holding grudges, especially against his father and oldest sister. Makoto is the only blond in his family, as a result of his English grandmother.

=== Drama club ===

Ito and Makoto&#x27;s friends in the drama club, Yoshirô, Misaki, and Nobuko, first appeared in another manga by Emura, &quot;Mokugekisha&quot; (&quot;Eyewitness&quot;).
: The drama club&#x27;s male president, counterpart to Ito as female president. Yoshirô plays both male and female roles, such as the King in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and the Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He and Ito have been friends since they met in their second year of middle school, posing the question of whether a true friendship between male and female is possible? As opposed to a romantic tie. Yoshirô is secretly in love with Misaki, another Drama Club member. In a contest the last day of Drama Camp, in volume 10, Yoshirô loses and is forced to read aloud his secret wish: &quot;I love Misaki,&quot; but it languishes until volume 11 ...
: A member of the drama club, noted for being particularly feminine. During the series, Misaki plays such roles as a Lady-In-Waiting in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and the Prince in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. She is best friends with Nobuko and likes Yoshirô. Eventually, frustrated by his inability to act authentically, with real feeling, with her, she ignores him for some time until, encouraged by Ito, he commandeers the school PA system to publicly declare his love for her.
: The principal writer of the drama club. Nobuko writes, and as needed rewrites, most of the adaptations the club performs; she also plays roles such as a Lady-In-Waiting in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and Lady Capulet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Although in high school, she has had a novel published. In volume 12, Nobuko claims she thinks of Toki-Senpai as like a father to her, but after she is taken hostage by thieves, Toki-Senpai particularly worries about her, and it is implied that after this the two begin dating together.

=== Miura family ===
: Ito&#x27;s father, and widower of Satsuki. Gorô is the eldest son of Mitsuko, and was heir to the family until he withdrew from the family succession to marry Satsuki. They moved to the city and he began his own dojo. He cares deeply for his children, and is especially fond of his only daughter, Ito. As a parent, he is frequently absent, either at his dojo or meeting his writing deadlines as a novelist, but interferes with his children in one area: their choices for marriage. Gorô wants their mates to have &quot;good eyes&quot; and to be able to meet his gaze, as a sign of sincerity, integrity, and strong will. Despite this overprotectiveness, he allows his children to live freely, as his wife wanted them to. Despite his stubbornness and tendency to be dramatic, overall he is a wise and understanding person.
: Ito&#x27;s mother, who died in a car accident when Ito was six, about ten years before the series start. A strong, attractive woman, Satsuki was a dedicated wife and mother with a ferocious temper. She was particularly close to Yûto while alive, though she also had a close relationship with her only daughter. She was supportive of Ito&#x27;s tomboy tendencies, because she had been much like Ito as a child. Satsuki&#x27;s mother disappeared when she was 12, and her father died when she was 15, after which Satsuki was taken in by Mitsuko, Gorô&#x27;s mother. Eventually, she and Gorô fell in love and eloped. The last thing Satsuki said to Ito before her death was to &quot;live freely, and become the woman you want to be when you find the one who moves your heart.&quot;
: Ito&#x27;s oldest brother, and Yûto&#x27;s twin, aged 23 years. Ryûya shares his father&#x27;s dramatic personality, especially when angered. He is the most protective of the family of Ito, and after their mother&#x27;s death, he taught her martial arts. As the eldest son, he is usually in charge of the household, as their father, Gorô, is usually either at the dojo or writing his novels. When Ryûya went to college, he met a foreign exchange student from America, Christina, and after a year of interesting courtship, they fell in love. For a while he and Gorô fought over going out with her, due to Gorô&#x27;s declarations of never allowing a foreigner to marry any of his children. Christina or &quot;Chris&quot; eventually comes to challenge Gorô to date Ryūya, resorting to underhanded tactics to punch him in the face. Fortunately, Gorô instantly respects her for her resourcefulness and courage and gives the couple his blessing.
: Ito&#x27;s second oldest brother, and Ryûya&#x27;s twin, aged 23 years. (To tell the twins apart, Yûto is the twin with shorter hair, and he smokes.) Yûto is the family cook, thanks to his mother&#x27;s lessons, and also works as a cook at a hotel restaurant. He is level-headed and introverted, almost the opposite of his twin brother&#x27;s, although his dedication to his younger sister is just as strong. Because of his fears of losing those he loves like he lost his mother, he has trouble meeting new people and allowing them into his life. Despite this, when Yûto meets Akane, Makoto&#x27;s sister, they begin dating, and their relationship grows deeper as the series progresses.
: Ito&#x27;s younger brother, aged 15 years. He always wears sunglasses on his head because he claims it makes him look cool. Although he prefers hanging out with his friends at the arcade, as the youngest child he gets stuck with a lot of the household work. Although he does not show it as much as his older brothers, he cares a lot about Ito, and defends her when necessary. He serves on the school student council. Although he claims he wishes to go out with a girl who is the opposite of Ito, he is interested in another member of the student council, Rie, whose personality is identical to his older sister&#x27;s. Tatsuyoshi is featured in Emura&#x27;s manga Nana-iro no Shinwa.
: Ito&#x27;s grandmother and the Miura family matriarch. Mitsuko is a small but crafty old woman who is stronger than she looks. She originally took Satsuki in after she was orphaned, and later helped her and Gorô elope. Mitsuko has a bizarre fascination with different fashions, using her grandchildren and their friends as her &quot;victims.&quot; She is especially fond of Japanese historical fashions. Normally she has a mild demeanor, but she is ruthless in pursuing her goal of having a stable family heir, which leads her one time to kidnap Ito and challenge Ito&#x27;s brothers into fighting to retrieve her. First seen in volume 6.
: Ito&#x27;s cousin, the son of Gorô&#x27;s younger sister Setsuko. He is three years younger than Ito and the presumptive heir to the Miura family&#x27;s (Mitsuko&#x27;s) dojo. He infuriates his strict mother by always crossdressing and thinking of himself as a girl. Ito is the only woman he claims to be interested in, which leads to their grandmother Mitsuko offering Ito the place of her successor.
: Gorô&#x27;s younger sister and Tomoe&#x27;s mother. She has the same explosive temper as her brother, but Ryuya and Yuto note that while their father is fire, she is ice. Years before, she helped torment Satsuki, including roughly cutting off her long hair. She finally ended up kidnapping and locking Satsuki up in order to prevent her brother from eloping with her. Eventually, she comes to accept her brother&#x27;s children. Her son Tomoe causes her the most grief by refusing to be a proper boy, to the point she frequently chases after him to dropkick some toughness into him. She also has a daughter Kozue, described as &quot;sickly&quot; and two years older than Tomoe.

=== Narita family ===
: Makoto&#x27;s father is a strict disciplinarian who runs a kenpo martial arts dojo. He is a man of tradition, who feels that absolute respect from his family is very important. After his oldest child, Sakura, eloped to escape the arranged marriage that he had set up to preserve the dojo, he took drastic measures to keep them from ever disobeying him—focusing especially Makoto, his only son and prospective heir to the dojo. For a couple years after Sakura&#x27;s elopement, Masumi trained Makoto strictly, rarely letting him out of the house. Shortly before the series starts, after Masumi settled down, Makoto offered a proposition: if he could disguise himself as a girl for the rest of high school, to show how serious he is, Masumi would allow him to become an actor. Masumi frequently sends spies to check up on Makoto, though he eventually calls them off for a while when he sends another challenge to Makoto. Though he is strict with most of his family, he is gentler with his wife, Risa, who can match him in ferocity, and he dotes on his second daughter, Tsubaki, whom he sees as the most obedient of his children. Masumi particularly enjoys eating his wife&#x27;s homemade caramel flan five times a day.
: Risa, a frail middle-aged woman, is Makoto&#x27;s mother. Risa&#x27;s mother was English, from whom Makoto got his blond hair, and her maiden name was Amano, which Makoto uses for his alias at school. Unlike her husband, she wants her children to make their own choices; however, she rarely intercedes for her children. When she learned of Makoto&#x27;s proposition to his father, she fainted from shock at the idea of her son dressing like a girl and that her chronic illness is implied to be mostly caused by it. Despite her frailty and mild demeanor, she is able to cow her husband with a single look, and during the series she violently forces her husband to reconcile with their oldest daughter, Sakura.
: Sakura is Makoto&#x27;s oldest sister, aged 25 years. A few years before the series starts, she eloped with her boyfriend to escape an arranged marriage. Angered by this, her father took out his frustration on his other children, especially Makoto. She is on estranged terms from her father and her sister Tsubaki, but secretly maintains contact with her other sister Akane and younger brother Makoto. However, when they meet, Makoto stands silently behind Akane, never speaking to Sakura, to her great sadness. When, later in the series, Sakura meets Makoto and Ito during a class trip, she is pleased to see that Makoto has softened up in Ito&#x27;s presence. She feels that because of Ito, Makoto can be more himself, especially after being stifled under his father&#x27;s influence. With Ito&#x27;s help, Makoto and Sakura finally are able to make amends after six years of silence.
: As evidenced by her elopement, Sakura has the fiercest personality of the four Narita children and is incredibly headstrong. Marriage has mellowed her but she has a whimsical side that emerges occasionally, particularly in Ito&#x27;s presence. Sakura has a complex with pretty girls and will sometimes drag a hapless Ito to the bathroom to put make up on her.
: Sakura&#x27;s husband Taiki is a fairly successful artist, and they have a young son Satoshi. As the result of an exhibition of her husband&#x27;s work, and some scheming by Ito, Sakura reconciles with her father, although her mother has to forcibly make father and daughter behave. Sakura&#x27;s name () means &quot;cherry blossom,&quot; part of a theme of flower names for the three Narita daughters.
: Tsubaki is the middle of Makoto&#x27;s three older sisters, aged 24 years. Tsubaki is a biology teacher who, under her father&#x27;s orders, comes to work at Makoto&#x27;s school to spy on him. She feels that, unlike her other siblings, she does all that their father asks, and she resents Sakura because she was left to ease their father&#x27;s temper after Sakura eloped. Despite her submissive attitude towards her father, Tsubaki has a firm personality with a frightening ability to lead, demonstrated when she trains her class to be ultimate athletes to win an inter-class athletic tournament. She is obsessed with Makoto, and has pictures of him all over the walls of her room, and as his older sister believes she knows what is best for him. Although she disapproves of the deal Makoto made with their father, she occasionally gives Makoto frilly dresses to wear as a girl. Tsubaki is the opposite of her older sister Sakura in that she has an obsession with pretty boys, with something of a shota complex, and she is disappointed when she realizes Ito is a girl.
: When Tsubaki learns that Ito knows Makoto&#x27;s true identity, she orders Makoto to come home on the grounds that he lost his deal with his father, but relents when Makoto pleads with her, on the condition that Ito and Makoto&#x27;s class wins an inter-class athletic competition, which they narrowly lose. However, with Akane&#x27;s help, they recreate a scene from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for Tsubaki and so persuade her that Makoto&#x27;s passion and talent for his acting is real, and that Makoto is happier and more natural with Ito than he ever was with his sisters. Tsubaki finally promises not to tell their father. In her last major scene in &#x27;W Juliet&#x27; she has moved out of her father&#x27;s house into her own apartment, closer to work, and hosts Makoto&#x27;s 18th birthday party. She has an affectionate relationship with Makoto&#x27;s fiance, Takayo, and dotes on her. Tsubaki&#x27;s name () means &quot;camellia,&quot; a flower like her sisters.
: Akane is the youngest of Makoto&#x27;s three older sisters, aged 22 years. She works as a make-up artist, though she is still technically a student. She looks almost exactly like Makoto before she cuts her hair halfway through the first volume. Although she is a quiet and naturally formal type of person, she is also observant and wise. Though she isn&#x27;t as rebellious as Sakura, she isn&#x27;t the obedient daughter that Tsubaki is, demonstrated in her determination to be a make-up artist, much to her father&#x27;s disapproval. She also demonstrates great empathy as well as an unexpected backbone, despite her conflict between pleasing her parents and following her dreams. Akane originally inspired Makoto to become an actor when she sneaked him out of the house when they were younger to see a local play. She is the most supportive of Makoto&#x27;s family of his decision to become an actor, and she frequently helps him keep up his act, for example, bringing him clothes or make-up when he needs them, helping him shop for girl&#x27;s clothing, and teaching him how to apply makeup. Akane is the first of their family to learn about Makoto&#x27;s secret relationship with Ito. She appears to like Ito a lot, and when she eventually meets Ito&#x27;s brother Yûto, the two hit it off very well.
: Over the course of the series, Akane comes to be stronger, to the point in which she stands up to her father to refuse the arranged marriage he sets up for her. She also comes to break through Yûto&#x27;s emotional shell and forces him to face his feelings for her as well as his feelings for others. Akane&#x27;s name () means &quot;madder,&quot; completing the trend of flower names for the Narita sisters.
: Makoto&#x27;s sickly fiancée, through an engagement arranged by his father. To her dismay, however, Makoto never acknowledges her as more than a friend. Takayo acts demurely in front of elders and Makoto, but she is jealous of Ito and wishes to be rid of her. Because revealing Makoto&#x27;s secret would effectively return him to confinement in the Narita house and make her feel dirty, she keeps it, though reluctantly. Takayo transfers into his school to be closer to him, but due to her poor health, she is absent much of the time. Her family is very rich, and she has bodyguards and spies at her disposal. Her elder brother has a &quot;little sister complex&quot; and will do anything for her; he feels his sister is truly noble, and would do anything for her, and is often moved to tears by the smallest acts on her part. When he learns of Makoto&#x27;s secret, only her begging him stops him from revealing it. According to an author&#x27;s note, originally she was conceived as a much nastier character with a &quot;persecution complex&quot;.

== Development ==

According to an author&#x27;s note, &quot;W Juliet&quot; was created as a one-shot manga early in her career, after she had published around eight other one-shots. Public response brought an invitation to write a second chapter, and so on, until by the fourth chapter&#x27;s responses, it was decided that Emura could continue the story as a continuing series, eventually enabling her to quit her day job, and later enabling her to hire her sister as an assistant.

Originally, Ito and Makoto were both going to be called Ito, but Emura&#x27;s editor convinced her to change their names. According to the author, if they had shared a name, the &quot;W&quot; (double) in the title would have had more significance. Emura then bestowed the second Ito name on the club&#x27;s faculty advisor, Ms. Ito.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===
&quot;W Juliet&quot; was published by Hakusensha in &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; between 1997 and 2002 and collected in 14 bound volumes. It is licensed in North America by VIZ Media, in France by Pika Édition, in Spain by Panini Comics, in Germany by Carlsen Comics (which is serializing it in &quot;Daisuki&quot;), and in Sweden by Manga Media.






A sequel series, &quot;W Juliet II&quot;, is ongoing in the irregularly published &quot;The Hana to Yume&quot; magazine, and collected in twelve volumes as of December 2021.






=== Drama CDs ===
&quot;W Juliet&quot; was adapted as a series of three drama CDs released in Japan. One of the discs was only made available to &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; fans.

== Reception ==

Sakura Eries felt the first volume was &quot;pure and simple romantic comic fluff, and it&#x27;s a lot of fun&quot;. She enjoyed the comedy of the second volume, and found Ito and Makoto&#x27;s developing relationship &quot;endearing&quot;. Eries enjoyed the amusement park storyline which derived its humour from Makoto&#x27;s cross-dressing, but found it implausible that Ito could not rescue herself from Toki, and felt this situation was out of place with the tone of the rest of the volume. Eries enjoyed the introduction of Makoto and Ito&#x27;s families, which she felt allowed the two to expand their own roles in the story aside from student, actor and boyfriend/girlfriend. By the twelfth volume, Carl Kimlinger felt that &quot;W Juliet&quot; toed the line &quot;between comfortable and stagnant&quot; too often, and felt that the story had no &quot;real suspense&quot;, as each character has &quot;a certain core decency&quot; that can be reached.

June Shimoshi, writing for Library Journal, recommended the manga for teen collections, saying &quot; Despite the wacky gender-bending scenario, this old-fashioned shōjo romance emphasizes hard work, strong convictions, and the importance of family. It balances humor with quiet, reflective scenes.&quot;

<text>Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki hr. Piława (1785–1862) was a Polish nobleman (&quot;szlachcic&quot;), landowner, political and economic activist.

<doc id="1318813" wikidata="Q71074" url="?curid=1318813" title="Hasso Plattner">
<text>Hasso Plattner (born 21 January 1944) is a German businessman who is the co-founder of SAP SE software company. From 2003 to 2024, he served as the chairman of the company&#x27;s supervisory board. As of August 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that he possessed a net worth of US$17.9 billion. 

==Early life==
Plattner was born to German ophthalmologist Horst Plattner (1918–2001) and his wife shortly before the end of the Second World War, in Berlin. He grew up in Bavaria and completed his masters degree in communications engineering from the University of Karlsruhe in 1968.

==Career==
In 1972, Plattner and four colleagues left IBM to launch SAP, where he eventually served as co-chief executive (together with Henning Kagermann) from 1998. He stepped down in 2003 at age 60. 

From 2003 to 2024, Plattner chaired the company&#x27;s supervisory board and played an influential role in the company&#x27;s governance, orchestrating the hiring of co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein in 2019. He has reduced his stake in SAP several times; as of 2020, he owned a 5.89% stake, making him the company&#x27;s largest individual shareholder.

In 1998, Plattner founded the non-profit Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI). He is Chair of Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts and Professor of Enterprise Systems at HPI.

In 2005, Plattner set up his own venture capital fund, Hasso Plattner Ventures, with more than 25 million euros. By December 2009, HPV managed €150 million and had 17 companies in its portfolio, including online cruise portals Dreamlines. An affiliate fund, HPV Africa in Cape Town, was founded in 2008, with €29 million, and soon invested in five companies. Plattner provides the lion&#x27;s share of this investment capital. In September 2010, HPV invested $6 million in Israeli software company Panaya in exchange for the company&#x27;s stakes.

==Sporting interests==
In 2005, Plattner&#x27;s maxZ86 maxi yacht set a record at the Transpacific Yacht Race and was the scratch boat when it led a five-boat assault on the record for monohulls. She finished the race in 6 days, 16 hours, 4 minutes, and 11 seconds to win &quot;the Barn Door&quot; trophy, a slab of carved koa wood traditionally awarded to the monohull with the fastest elapsed time. In 2013, he won the German Dragon Championship as part of a three-man crew that included Hamish Pepper.

Plattner is a keen golfer. In 1994, he acquired the Fancourt Hotel and Country Club, which has three Gary Player-designed championship courses, in addition to the CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin, California. The Links of Fancourt staged the 2003 Presidents Cup matches between the US and an international team, captained by Gary Player. 

Plattner is also an investor in San Jose Sports &amp; Entertainment Enterprises, which owns the San Jose Sharks, and other related properties as well as managing the city owned SAP Center at San Jose. In 2013, he bought out two of the partners in SJS&amp;E, and began serving as the Sharks&#x27; representative on the National Hockey League&#x27;s board of governors. However, general manager Mike Grier and his staff run the hockey operations.

==Philanthropy==
Plattner signed The Giving Pledge in February 2013. In 2015, he set up the Hasso Plattner Foundation and the charity&#x27;s activities span education, art and culture, and conservation. Since 2017, the foundation has been headquartered at Villa Wunderkind in Potsdam, the former home of German fashion designer Wolfgang Joop.

===HIV/AIDS===
Plattner has had strong connections with South Africa over the years and spends some of his time living there, while participating in charitable work. In the fight against AIDS, he supports the universities of KwaZulu Natal and Cape Town.

Plattner&#x27;s donation of €6 million for the &quot;Isombululo&quot; programme for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS was announced at the Presidents Cup, one of the world&#x27;s leading international golf tournaments in 2003 and it is suggested that this amount will have helped 360,000 people. In the spring of 2005, Plattner personally covered the costs of the 46664 benefit concert, which took place at his Gary Player-designed golf course, The Links of Fancourt in George which is near Cape Town and which was broadcast globally on television. Proceeds went towards the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, an organisation co-founded by former South African president Nelson Mandela.

===Architecture and visual arts===
Plattner contributed more than €20 million which enabled reconstruction of the historic exterior of the Stadtschloss in Potsdam, which had damaged during World War II and demolished in 1959. At the time, it was the largest donation ever gifted in Germany by a single individual. 

In 2016, Plattner joined forces with art dealer Guy Wildenstein to form the Wildenstein Plattner Institute, a foundation dedicated to advancing art historical scholarship by fostering the accessibility, cataloguing, and digitisation of primary sources. 

Plattner also helped in the establishment of the Museum Barberini, devoted to his holdings of modern and Impressionist art, as well as artists active in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). For the museum, he purchased one of Monet’s 1890 &quot;Meules&quot; paintings for $110.7 million at a 2019 Sotheby&#x27;s auction, making it the most high-priced Impressionist work ever sold at auction. In 2022, he opened , another private museum in Potsdam, which focuses on East German artists who were active after the fall of the Berlin wall.

===Research===
Since his retirement from SAP, Plattner has been particularly active as a benefactor in the field of technological research. Media reports have named him one of Germany&#x27;s most important private sponsors of scientific research. In 1998, Plattner founded the Hasso Plattner Institute for software systems engineering based at the University of Potsdam, and in Palo Alto, California, its sole source of funding being the non-profit Hasso Plattner Foundation for Software Systems Engineering. Plattner has pledged €50 million of his personal fortune over a period of 20 years. Since its foundation, Plattner&#x27;s commitment to the HPI has quadrupled to over €200 million. He not only fully finances the HPI, but is also actively involved as a director and lecturer in Enterprise Platforms and Integration Concepts.

In October 2005, with a donation of US$35 million, Plattner founded the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University. Students of varying disciplines have been charged with the development of user-friendly innovations. Another of Plattner&#x27;s pledges to promote science was of €10 million to redevelop the library at the University of Mannheim, Germany, given in 2003.

==Recognition==
On 21 January 2004, at a ceremony at the Hasso Plattner Institute celebrating the 60th birthday of its founder, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder made the following comments on Plattner&#x27;s achievements: &quot;We need more Hasso Plattners and more SAPs in order to get Germany moving again economically.&quot; According to the Chancellor, Plattner created an international corporation proving &quot;that German companies can be at the top of the technological hierarchy worldwide&quot;. In an interview in August 2004, management consultant Roland Berger named Hasso Plattner as one of the five Germans who have made the greatest impression on him. In the &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; article Berger pointed out how Plattner founded, built up and adapted SAP to a changing market was a &quot;master achievement&quot;. 

===Honorary degrees===
Plattner received his honorary doctorate in 2002, and his honorary professorship in 2004 from the University of Potsdam. He had also received an honorary doctorate (1990) and an honorary professorship in Information Systems (1994) from the Saarland University, Saarbrücken. The same university named him an honorary senator in 1998.

===Awards===
* 2014 – &quot;Leonardo European Corporate Learning Award&quot;, &quot;Thought Leadership&quot; category
* 2015 – GABA Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by the German American Business Association (GABA)
* 2016 – Prize for Understanding and Tolerance, presented by the Jewish Museum Berlin
* 2017 – Werner von Siemens Ring

==Personal life==
Plattner is married to Sabine Plattner, a former teacher. The couple has two daughters, who grew up in Heidelberg, Germany. 

Plattner lives in San Jose, California, which he considers his &#x27;adopted home&#x27;. Since his retirement from SAP he hasn&#x27;t visited Germany. The family also maintains residences in Potsdam&#x27;s Babelsberg district, Sylt and Yzerfontein.

<text>Johanna Maria Quandt (; 21 June 1926 – 3 August 2015) was a German billionaire businesswoman and the widow of Herbert Quandt, an industrialist and prominent Nazi. When she died in 2015 she was the 8th richest person in Germany (and the richest German woman), the 77th richest person in the world, and the 11th richest woman worldwide according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

==Career at BMW==

Johanna Bruhn became a secretary in her future husband&#x27;s office in the 1950s and eventually became his personal assistant. The two married in 1960. After his death in 1982, she was a major shareholder in BMW and sat on its supervisory board from 1982 until she retired in 1997. Much of that time she served as deputy chairwoman of the board. She owned 16.7% of BMW at the time of her death.

== &quot;The Silence of the Quandts&quot; ==
The documentary &quot;The Silence of the Quandts&quot; described the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. It disclosed information about the use of slave labourers in the family&#x27;s factories during World War II. A later study funded by the Quandt family themselves concluded that &quot;the Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis&quot;. As of 2008 no compensation, apology or memorial at the site of one of their factories, have been permitted. BMW was not implicated in the report.

==Personal life==

The two children of her marriage, Stefan and Susanne, are also substantial shareholders in BMW and now sit on the supervisory board of the company. Police prevented an attempt to kidnap her and her daughter Susanne Klatten in 1978. Johanna lived quietly in Bad Homburg.

A programme by the German public broadcaster, ARD, in October 2007 described in detail the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. As a result, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian will examine the family&#x27;s activities during Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship.

As of August 2014, the Quandt family is estimated to be worth $46.3 billion. Johanna Quandt died at the age of 89 in her home in Bad Homburg near Frankfurt am Main.

She created the foundation &quot;Johanna Quandt Stiftung&quot;, to provide training for aspiring business journalists. The foundation also provides prizes for outstanding business journalism. In 2009 she was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit.

<doc id="1318827" wikidata="Q3526900" url="?curid=1318827" title="George Lohmann">
<text>George Alfred Lohmann (2 June 1865 – 1 December 1901) was an English cricketer, regarded as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. Statistically, he holds the lowest lifetime Test bowling average among bowlers with more than fifteen wickets and he has the second highest peak rating for a bowler in the ICC ratings. He also holds the record for the lowest strike rate (balls bowled between each wicket taken) in all Test history.

He bowled at around medium pace and on English pitches of his time could gain spin, so that when rain affected the pitch he was unplayable. Against the best batsmen, too, Lohmann possessed skill and guile, and he could vary his pace, flight and break deceptively, so as to worry batsmen on better pitches. He was the finest slip fielder of his time and in county cricket a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries for Surrey and averaged 25 in 1887.

In 2016, Lohmann was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Lohmann played in a few colts matches at the beginning of 1884, and impressed sufficiently to play ten first-class cricket for Surrey that season. He did little bowling but nonetheless established himself as a regular member of the side for his promising batting.

The following season was nothing short of a sensation. Lohmann not only became Surrey&#x27;s leading bowler, but was the leading first-class wicket-taker with 142 wickets. He also showed his promise as a batsman was no fluke, for he scored 571 runs. In 1886, Lohmann did equally well and played his first Test matches for England against Australia. He took only one wicket at Old Trafford, and none at Lord&#x27;s, but his continued superb form in other first-class matches saw him retained for the last match at The Oval. Here, Lohmann established himself as a great bowler with a superb twelve for 104 (7 for 36 and 5 for 68), giving England what is still one of its most decisive wins in an Ashes series. Again being the leading first-class wicket-taker, Lohmann was chosen to tour Australia with Alfred Shaw&#x27;s team.

==World&#x27;s premier bowler==
On his first tour, Lohmann moved even further ahead of the pack as a bowler. In the Second Test at the SCG, Lohmann became the first bowler to take eight wickets in a Test innings, and, in the abnormally dry English season of 1887, showed himself far ahead of any other bowler. Despite being severely punished during the middle of the season when handicapped by a finger injury, Lohmann to 154 wickets whereas the next highest was 114, becoming deadly when the weather broke up in August. He also made his highest score as a batsman, scoring 115 against Sussex at Hove, whilst his aggregate of runs for the season totalled 843. Lohmann again toured Australia in the winter of 1887/1888, and with Johnny Briggs formed an irresistible combination on a sticky wicket in the only Test match.

In 1888, a summer as wet as 1887 had been dry, Lohmann took full advantage of the dreadful pitches on which most matches were played, taking 209 wickets for only 10.90 each, including 142 in 14 county matches. In the three Tests against Australia, Briggs, Bobby Peel and Billy Barnes did so well that Lohmann had to do little bowling at the Oval and Old Trafford. However, he took eight wickets at Lord&#x27;s and made his only Test fifty at the Oval. In 1889, Lohmann again took over 200 wickets (115 for 1485 runs in purely county matches) and took nine wickets in an innings for the first time against Sussex.

==Early County Championship triumphs==
In 1890, the County Championship was officially constituted for the first time after years of unofficial &quot;champion&quot; counties. Lohmann continued to carry all before him in 1890, taking a career-best 220 wickets and being the leading wicket-taker outside of touring teams for the sixth successive season. For Surrey in county cricket he totalled 113 wickets, and he again helped England to victory over Australia in the only Tests where cricket took place. In 1891, Lohmann was the leading English wicket-taker for the seventh successive year with 177 wickets as Surrey carried all before them in a wet summer, and on the following winter&#x27;s Australian tour, he again bowled wonderfully well, taking eight for 58 on a dry wicket in Sydney.

In 1892, with Surrey still crushing all opposition in the County Championship race, Lohmann &quot;suffered only by comparison with previous years&quot;. He surprisingly ceded the position of Surrey&#x27;s chief bowler to the emergent William Lockwood who took full advantage of Oval pitches being extremely fiery and untrue due to reconditioning of the square, but it still seemed as though Lohmann had many years of county and Test cricket ahead of him. A rude shock to Surrey was to come, however.

==Illness and comeback==
After the 1892 season had ended, a dreadful shock came when it was announced that Lohmann had contracted tuberculosis. In an effort to improve his health, he sailed during the 1892/1893 winter to Cape Town. Although at first it was hoped that he might return even when the 1893 season began, for two years his health did not at first improve and he could not play at all for Surrey in 1893 or 1894. In fact, he was not well enough to play any cricket until the 1894/1895 Currie Cup final where he turned out for Western Province.

By July 1895 Lohmann&#x27;s health had recovered sufficiently for him to return to England and play for Surrey again. Fortuitously, his return coincided with a return to extremely treacherous wickets after a long spell of dry weather and much better pitches than he had ever bowled on before. Though completely overshadowed by Tom Richardson, the mere fact of missing the good wickets in May and June caused Lohmann to actually beat Richardson in the averages, though his batting (seen as an important part of his county cricket up to 1892) was completely insignificant.

==Record breaking feats==

Returning to the British Cape Colony to maintain his health, Lohmann played no more first-class cricket until February, yet on the matting wickets in three &quot;Tests&quot; (the England eleven was no more than England &quot;A&quot; of today), Lohmann was so unplayable that he took 35 wickets for the remarkable average of just 5.80 runs each. During this series Lohmann twice broke the record for best average in Test cricket: he took 15 for 45 in the first Test, including a hat-trick (the fourth Test cricket hat-trick) at the end of the second innings to win the match; and after not being put on initially in the second Test, he became the first bowler to take nine wickets in a Test innings (a feat subsequently emulated only 14 times and surpassed only three times).

In 1896, Lohmann began to play for Surrey at the end of May, and, though he took 93 wickets and helped Richardson to put Australia out for 53 on a good wicket at Lord&#x27;s, it was thought he had not come up to expectations. Indeed, on several occasions when pitches were suited to him, his bowling should have met with much greater success. Still, he had a fully satisfactory benefit in the game against Yorkshire in August.

A pay dispute, in which he demanded twice the existing 10-pound match fee given at the time to professional cricketers, caused Lohmann, along with Billy Gunn, to withdraw from the last Test match. He continued to play for Surrey that August, but at the end of the season his health again degenerated and had to return to South Africa, and a continuation of the 1896 pay dispute caused Lohmann to retire from his English career for good.

He is also the fastest Test bowler to reach 100 wickets, taking just 16 matches. Lohmann also holds the record for the most Test matches in a complete career (18) where a player bowled in both innings.

==Last days==
Lohmann emigrated to the British Cape Colony permanently in 1897 and played a full season of first-class cricket for Western Province. In five matches on matting pitches during March 1897 he took 34 wickets for 12.26 runs each, but it was clear throughout that year that his health was unlikely to recover, and he was able to play only one further first-class match for &quot;A Bailey&#x27;s Transvaal XI&quot;.

Lohmann did come back to England in 1901 to manage the second South African touring team (and the first whose matches were recognised as first-class). However, his health was clearly never going to recover completely, and even after returning to Cape Town with the onset of autumn in England, Lohmann&#x27;s condition only became more critical. On 1 December 1901, the tuberculosis he had fought against for nine years finally claimed his life at age 36. He was buried at Matjiesfontein.

<text>The 40.6 cm SK C/34, sometimes known as the Adolfkanone (Adolf gun), was a German naval gun, designed in 1934 by Krupp and originally intended for the early H-class battleships.

==Description==
Intended to be mounted in battleship turrets, the guns were produced in left and right-handed pairs. These pairs were split for individual mounting in the coastal defence role. The gun&#x27;s barrel was approximately long. In a coastal defence emplacement the gun could be elevated to 52 degrees, giving it a range of with the special long range shell called the Adolf-shell. It used the standard German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag. In terms of construction the guns were identical to the 38 cm SK C/34 - only the calibre of the barrel was different. The rate of fire for the weapon was around 2 rounds per minute as coastal artillery.

==Original naval specifications==
* Date of design - 1934
* Entered service - 1940 (as coastal defense guns)
* Bore - 
* Length of barrel with rear piece - 
* Weight of barrel - 158 metric tons (158,664 kg)

* Propellant weight - 2 part charge total weight 302 kg for ordinary shell and 312 kg for long range shell
* Maximum range - Standard shell 42,800 m (42.8 km); long-range shell 56,000 m (56 km)
* Muzzle Velocity - Standard shell ; long-range shell 
* Mountings - 2 gun turret Drh LC/34 (1,475 metric tons)

==Coastal defense==
Since the intended 56,000-ton H-class battleships “H” and “J” were never completed, the guns that had been designed for them were used as coastal defense artillery during the Second World War. At least twelve guns were produced; seven were sited in Norway, and three were used in Poland near Danzig. Soon after their first training shots, the Polish guns were moved to France and sited near Sangatte and renamed &quot;Batterie Lindemann&quot; in honour of the fallen captain of the battleship , &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; Ernst Lindemann. One of the remaining guns was used to replace the worn-out gun #2 at &quot;Batterie Lindemann&quot;, while serial #11 has not been accounted for yet (it may have also been used as replacement at &quot;Batterie Lindemann&quot;).

===Gun sites in Poland===
The first three guns were situated at the Hel Fortified Area, Poland as Battery Schleswig-Holstein (German unit MKB 2 / MAA 119) during 1940 to protect the Bay of Danzig. All three guns were fired during May and June 1941 and shortly after the guns were dismounted and transported to France for use as Battery Lindemann. From this new location near Sangatte in France, they were used to fire at Dover, in the county of Kent in England and shipping in the English Channel. There is a Museum of Coastal Defence located in the remains of the battery in Hel.

===Gun sites in Norway===
The seven guns that reached their destinations in Norway were split into two batteries:
* Battery Dietl with three guns on the island of Engeløya, Steigen. German unit MKB 4 / MAA 516
* Battery Theo with four guns mounted at Trondenes Fort near Harstad. German unit MKB 5 / MAA 511

After the end of the war the Trondenes guns were taken over by the Norwegian Army, along with 1,227 shells. The battery was last fired in 1957 and formally decommissioned in 1964. The three Engeløya guns were sold for scrap in 1956 but the four guns at Trondenes were spared and one is open as a museum. In the summer there are normally three or four guided tours per day.

===Gun sites in France===
The three guns from Hel, re-sited in France and renamed Batterie Lindemann (German unit MKB 6 / MAA 244), saw considerable service. The three guns were emplaced singly in turrets, protected by massive concrete encasements in places four metres thick. The battery fired 2,226 shells at Dover between 1940 and 1944. The guns were not put out of action by bombing despite being hit many times, thanks to the thick concrete. Only Bruno turret was damaged, on 3 September 1944, when a shell from a British railway gun hit its elevating gear; the battery was captured shortly afterwards.

==Naval projectiles==
* L/4.4 m Bd Z Hb (AP) - 1,030 kg. (25 kg. bursting charge) Armour-piercing shell, rear fuse
* L/4.8 m KZ m Hb (HE) - 1,030 kg. (80 kg. bursting charge) High-explosive shell, front fuse
* L/4.6 m Bd Z Hb (SAP)- 1,030 kg. (45 kg. bursting charge) High-explosive shell, rear fuse

==Coastal artillery projectiles==

* L/4.2 m KZ m Hb (Adolf) (HE)- 600 kg. 50 kg. bursting charge. Both front and rear fuse
* L/4.1 m KZ m Hb (HE) - 610 kg. 50 kg. bursting charge.

<text>The MV &quot;Queen of New Westminster&quot; is a Canadian roll-on, roll-off passenger ferry operated by BC Ferries.

In 1964, the vessel was built as one of seven Victoria class ferries. Like her sister ships, she was lengthened in 1973 at Burrard Dry Dock. After the ship damaged a crankshaft beyond repair, she was re-engined with four Wärtsilä engines, had the car deck platform ramps removed and was raised to add a second car deck at Vancouver Shipyards in 1991. After being raised for a second car deck, she would normally be considered a Victoria class ferry as she shares most of the characteristics of that class, but because of her improved powerplants and higher clearance car decks, she is unique. Her two former sister ships are the Burnaby class vessels &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; and &quot;Queen of Burnaby&quot;, which are also not considered Victoria class vessels because they did not receive the additional car deck which created the final Victoria class ferries.

Though her four Victoria class sister ships were all scrapped by 2012, she had a major refit of her passenger areas between late 2007 and early 2009 to prepare her for another ten to fifteen years of service.

==Structural refits==

In 1973 the ship was cut in half to enable an additional 25-meter section to be inserted at a cost of $2.5 million and in 1991 she underwent a major rebuild including new engines and an additional car deck at a cost of $35.6 million.

==Accidents==

In October, 1971, &quot;Queen of New Westminster&quot; pulled out of her berth at the Departure Bay terminal while vehicle loading was in progress. A car and its two occupants fell into the water. Both of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants were rescued.

In a similar incident, on August 13, 1992, the ship pulled out of her berth at the Departure Bay terminal while vehicle loading ramps were still lowered and resting on the ship. Three people were killed, one was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when a van from Alberta containing 6 people fell from the upper deck onto the lower car deck and finally into the sea below. The van was stopped and instructed to wait on the loading ramp by terminal crew members. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that this accident was caused primarily by the vessel not properly following departing procedures and secondarily due to poor communication between terminal and ship crew members.

==Sister ships==

&quot;Queen of New Westminster&quot; initially had six sister ships, none of which are still in service with BC Ferries. These ships were originally built as a single class but were modified through different combinations of deck-stretching, addition of more vehicle decks, and installation of more powerful engines. Though &quot;New West&quot; is a sister of these ships, the ship does not fit into either the V class or the Burnaby class.

<text>MV &quot;Queen of Nanaimo is a [[passenger vessel]] that was operated by [[BC Ferries]] from the time it entered service in 1964 until 2017. &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; was used to ferry passengers and vehicles from mainland [[British Columbia]], Canada to the islands off its coast. In 2017, the vessel was sold to Goundar Shipping Ltd. and renamedMV &quot;Lomaiviti Princess V for service in Fiji.

==Description==
As built the ferry measured with a length overall of and between perpendiculars with a beam of . The vessel was powered by two diesel engines driving two propellers giving the ship a maximum speed of .

In 1974, the ship was lengthened and &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot;″s was measured at long overall and between perpendiculars with the tonnage remeasured at and . In 2006 there was a major overhaul of its passenger areas. Its propulsion is by two Mirrlees National KVSSM twin turbocharged (intercooled) single acting 4-stroke, V16 diesel engines which produce at 320 rpm. 15-inch bore by stroke. Propellers are variable pitch (controllable-pitch propeller) made by KaMeWa (a Rolls-Royce company). The ship is capable of carrying 164 vehicles and 1,005 passengers and crew.

==Service history==
The ship was built by Victoria Machinery Depot of Victoria, British Columbia, on behalf of BC Ferries with the yard number 104. &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; was launched on December 3, 1963, and completed in June 1964. In 1974, the ship was rebuilt and extended in length. It operated on the Tsawwassen–Gulf Islands route web in British Columbia, Canada.

&quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; underwent two major refits, one in 2010 and the other in 2015, to maintain Transport Canada&#x27;s safety standards. On August 3, 2010, &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; had a &quot;hard landing&quot; at the Village Bay terminal on Mayne Island. Media reports suggested at least one serious injury and damage to vessel and dock. It was later established that the landing was caused by a mechanical failure after the ship ran over a commercial crab trap, making it impossible to put the ship into reverse. On July 1, 2011, &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; had another &quot;hard landing&quot; at the Tsawwassen terminal.

On November 2, 2013, the ship was pushed off course at Mayne Island after hitting severe weather. It damaged a private dock, but no one was injured.

On June 25, 2017, &quot;Queen of Nanaimo&quot; was taken out of service by BC Ferries due to issues with the vessel&#x27;s propellers. The ferry returned to service on June 29. The vessel was retired in mid-2017 and was sold to Goundar Shipping Ltd for service in Fiji. Renamed &quot;Lomaiviti Princess V&quot; after arrival in Fiji in November, the vessel began operations on the Suva–Savusavu route in December 2017. In June 2020, Goundar Shipping announced that the vessel would be sold for scrap. In June 2022, the vessel was sold to a scrap yard in Alang, India.

<text>is one of Japan&#x27;s wealthiest citizens with a fortune estimated to exceed $500 million. He is a controversial figure in Japanese political and commercial life.

Itoyama has served four terms as a member of the Diet, the Japanese Parliament with nearly twenty years of active involvement in the ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party. He was a principal figure in a 1974 bribery scandal that resulted in the arrests of more than 90 people, including a senior vice president of Itoyama&#x27;s company, and Peter Herzog characterized Itoyama as &quot;one of the worst offenders&quot; in having a &quot;cavalier attitude&quot; toward Japanese election laws.

In 1989, he was ranked 10th on Forbes&#x27; list of the world&#x27;s richest billionaires, but had fallen off by 1991. 

Itoyama became the single largest shareholder in Japan Airlines in February 1998 and publicly called for significant changes to management and business structures. He traveled to the United States and began negotiating the sale of JAL hotel properties such as the Ihilani Resort &amp; Spa in Honolulu and the Essex House in New York, despite having no actual authority to do so. JAL management moved to compromise with Itoyama by appointing him Special Adviser to the Chief Executive Officer in exchange for Itoyama&#x27;s giving up the right to object to management decisions at shareholder meetings. He sold half of his JAL stake on the open market in 2006 after the company failed to pay dividends for two years in a row.

He is a best-selling author, with books on political and business subjects, and is the chairman and benefactor of an eponymous educational institution.

<text>Peter Michael Nicholas (May 16, 1941 – May 14, 2022) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He co-founded medical device firm Boston Scientific with partner John Abele in 1979.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on May 16, 1941. He was the second of four children of Nicholas Nicholas and Vrysula (Coucouvitis), both of whom immigrated to the United States from Greece. His father was a United States Navy career officer and served during World War II. Nicholas attended St. Paul&#x27;s School in his home state, where he was a letterman in baseball, football, and squash. Although he was accepted into the United States Naval Academy, he did not pass an entrance physical examination due to his eyesight. He then received a late admission into Duke University, graduating in 1964. After serving in the U.S. Navy as a communications officer on the USS &quot;Lookout&quot; and member of the special operations warfare group for two years, he undertook postgraduate studies at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining a Master of Business Administration in 1968.

==Career==
Nicholas first worked for Eli Lilly and Company in sales, marketing, and management for a decade from 1968 to 1978. He subsequently acted as general manager of the Millipore Corporation&#x27;s medical products division.

Nicholas first met scientist John Abele at a Christmas party in Concord in 1979. The latter was president of Meditech at the time. They borrowed $800,000 to start Boston Scientific, a manufacturer of medical devices. He helped grow the company through a series of astute acquisitions. Nicholas was chief executive officer of the company until 1999, when he became chairman. He continued in that role until his retirement in 2016.

Nicholas was chairman emeritus of the Duke board of trustees. He was ranked #78 by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2005 list of &quot;The 400 Richest Americans&quot;, with an estimated worth of $4 billion, before finishing #189 the following year. Nicholas was one of seven Greek Americans to feature on the aforementioned list.

The Nicholas family gave $20 million to Duke University in 1996 for the School of the Environment, which subsequently renamed the school in his honor. In 2000, Nicholas was a recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Eight years later, Nicholas and his wife pledged a further $72 million to Duke; $70 million to the Nicholas School of the Environment, and $2 million to Perkins Library. He served on the board of advisors of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, which he established.

==Personal life==
Nicholas married Virginia (Ginny) Lilly, a descendant of Eli Lilly, in 1964, shortly after they both graduated from Duke University. They met while studying at the institution, and remained married until his death. Together, they had three children: Peter Jr., J.K., and Katherine. All three graduated from Duke, as did one of their granddaughters.

Nicholas died on May 14, 2022, at his home in Boca Grande, Florida, aged 80. He had been diagnosed with cancer.

<doc id="1318862" wikidata="Q731621" url="?curid=1318862" title="Joseph Safra">
<text>Joseph Safra (‎; 1 September 1938 – 10 December 2020) was a Swiss-based Lebanese Brazilian banker and billionaire businessman of Syrian descent. He was Brazil&#x27;s richest man and the richest banker in the world, running the Brazilian banking and investment empire, Safra Group.

Joseph Safra was the chairman of all Safra companies, among them Safra National Bank of New York and Banco Safra headquartered in São Paulo, Brazil. In August 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported Safra&#x27;s estimated net worth at US$22.8 billion, the 52nd richest person in the world and richest in Brazil.

==Early life==
Joseph Safra was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon to a Jewish family that, according to Safra family&#x27;s own sources, originally came from Aleppo, Syria, and with banking connections dating back to Ottoman times. The family&#x27;s banking history began in Aleppo with the foundation of the family’s first banking house in 1841, Aleppo was one of the major hubs of commerce and a mandatory route from the East to Europe, and from the latter to Persia and inner Asia. The Safra family financed trade and exchanged currencies for tradesmen, who came to the city through the desert and the Mediterranean. The Safra family moved to Brazil in 1952.

== Career ==
In 1955, Joseph&#x27;s 23-year-old brother, Edmond Safra, and his father, Jacob Safra, started working in Brazil by financing assets in São Paulo. However soon, Edmond Safra separated from his brothers Joseph and Moise and headed to New York City where he founded the Republic National Bank of New York (which he later sold to HSBC in 1999 and donated most of his money to the Edmond Safra Foundation). Joseph Safra founded Banco Safra in 1955 and today it is reportedly the 6th largest private bank in Brazil. In 2006, Joseph Safra acquired the remaining shares of Banco Safra from his brother Moise Safra. He remained the chairman of the Safra Group, offering banking services throughout Europe, North America, and South America, until the end of his life.

=== Property ===
In 2013, Joseph Safra&#x27;s family acquired more than a dozen properties in the United States, primarily in New York City. They also own a portfolio of commercial real estate in Brazil.

In 2014, Safra paid more than £700 million to buy The Gherkin, one of the most distinctive towers in the City of London. He proposed to build the Tulip, a skyscraper in London, but the city&#x27;s mayor rejected it in 2019. He founded the Jewish Brazilian school of Beit Yaacov in 2001.

===Business holdings===
*Chiquita
*Safra Group
**Banco Safra
**J. Safra Sarasin
**Safra National Bank of New York

==Personal life==
Safra was a resident of Geneva, Switzerland.In 1969, he married Vicky Sarfati. They had four children: Jacob J. Safra, (married to , son of Sasson Dayan), Alberto J. Safra, and David J. Safra. Jacob is responsible for the international operations while David manages Banco Safra in Brazil.

Safra died on 10 December 2020 in São Paulo at the age of 82. He had Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="1318870" wikidata="Q3587411" url="?curid=1318870" title="1932 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1932 United States Senate elections coincided with Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s landslide victory over incumbent Herbert Hoover in the presidential election. The 32 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies.

With the Hoover administration widely blamed for the Great Depression, Republicans lost twelve seats and control of the chamber to the Democrats, who won 28 of the 34 contested races (two Democratic incumbents, Duncan U. Fletcher of Florida and John H. Overton of Louisiana, were re-elected unopposed). Democrats gained another seat through an appointment in Nebraska, bringing their total number of seats up to 60. 

Among the Republican incumbents defeated in 1932 were Senate Majority Leader James Watson and five-term Senator Reed Smoot, an author of the controversial Smoot-Hawley tariff. This was the first of four elections in which a Senate leader lost re-election, and the only time they were a Republican. This election marked the first time a woman was elected to the Senate, that being Hattie Caraway of Arkansas. As of 2024, this is the last time Democrats won a Senate election in Kansas.

This is also one of only five occasions where 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in an election, with the other occasions being in 1920, 1946, 1958, and 1980.

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
Three Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election.

===Defeats===
Eleven Republicans and three Democrats sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election.

===Post-election changes===

=== Result of the November elections ===


== Race summary ==

All races are general elections for class 3 seats, unless noted.

=== Elections during the 72nd Congress ===
In these elections, the winners were elected and seated during 1932; ordered by election date.

=== Elections leading to the 73rd Congress ===
All elections are for Class 3 seats.

== Closest races ==
Eleven races had a margin of victory under 10%:

New York was the tipping point state with a margin of 17.2%.

== Alabama ==




== Arizona ==




== Arkansas ==
There were two elections for the same seat, due to the November 6, 1931 death of two-term Democrat Thaddeus H. Caraway.

Caraway&#x27;s widow, Democrat Hattie Wyatt Caraway, was appointed November 13, 1931 to continue his term.

=== Arkansas (special) ===



=== Arkansas (regular) ===
In May 1932, Caraway surprised Arkansas politicians by announcing that she would run for a full term in the upcoming election, joining a field already crowded with prominent candidates who had assumed she would step aside. She told reporters, &quot;The time has passed when a woman should be placed in a position and kept there only while someone else is being groomed for the job.&quot; When she was invited by Vice President Charles Curtis to preside over the Senate she took advantage of the situation to announce that she would run for reelection. Populist former Governor and Senator Huey Long of neighboring Louisiana traveled to Arkansas on a seven-day campaign swing on her behalf. She was the first female senator to preside over the body as well as the first to chair a committee (Senate Committee on Enrolled Bills). Lacking any significant political backing, Caraway accepted the offer of help from Long, whose efforts to limit incomes of the wealthy and increase aid to the poor she had supported. Long was also motivated by sympathy for the widow and his ambition to extend his influence into the home state of his party rival, Senator Joseph Robinson, who had been Al Smith&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate in 1928. Bringing his colorful and flamboyant campaign style to Arkansas, Long stumped the state with Caraway for a week just before the Democratic primary. He helped her to amass nearly twice as many votes as her closest opponent.

Long effectively used a method to quiet crying babies at campaign stops in Arkansas to encourage voter interest:

Mrs. Caraway would never forget nor cease to laugh over the plans we made for caring for obstreperous infants in the audience so that their mothers might listen to the speeches without the crowds being disturbed. I remember when I saw her notice one of our campaigners take charge of the first baby. The child began fretting and then began to cry. One of the young men accompanying us immediately gave it a drink of water. The child quieted for a bit and resumed a whimper, whereupon the same campaign worker handed the baby an all-day sucker, which it immediately grasped and soon fell asleep. Mrs. Caraway did not understand that it was a matter of design until it had been repeated several times.

Caraway went on to win the general election in November, with the accompanying victory of Franklin D. Roosevelt as U.S. President.




== California ==





== Colorado ==
There were two elections on November 8, 1932 for the same seat, due to the death of one-term Republican Charles W. Waterman. The primaries were held on September 13, 1932.

=== Colorado (special) ===


Democrat Walter Walker was appointed to continue the term, pending the special election, which he then lost.

Republican attorney Karl C. Schuyler was elected to finish the term, but he lost the contemporaneous election to the next term. He died in 1933.



=== Colorado (regular) ===

Democratic former senator Alva B. Adams was elected to start the new term that would begin in March 1933.




Adams would be re-elected once and serve until his December 1, 1941 death.
== Connecticut ==






== Florida ==




== Georgia ==

There were two elections due to the death of William J. Harris. It was only the second time that both of Georgia&#x27;s Senate seats have been up for election at the same time, following double-barrel elections in 1914.

=== Georgia (regular) ===



=== Georgia (special) ===

Democratic incumbent William J. Harris died April 18, 1932. Richard Russell Jr., the Democratic Governor of Georgia, appointed fellow-Democrat John S. Cohen April 25, 1932 to continue the term but Cohen was not a candidate for election.

Russell then won the September 14, 1932 Democratic primary over Representative Charles R. Crisp (nicknamed by Russell as &quot;kilowatt Charlie&quot; due to his links to the unpopular Georgia Power Company), 57.72% to 42.28%. Russell was then unopposed in the November 8, 1932 special election.

<text>Shari Arison (; born ) is an American-born Israeli businesswoman and philanthropist. She is the owner of Arison Investments, which consists of several business companies, and of The Ted Arison Family Foundation, which comprises several philanthropic organizations that operate as its subsidiaries. She was the controlling shareholder of Bank Hapoalim for 21 years, and after selling some of her shares in November 2018, she ceased to be the controlling shareholder at the bank. She was also an owner of Shikun &amp; Binui for 22 years, sold to the Saidoff Group on August 6, 2018.

As of 2007, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, she is the richest woman in the Middle East, and the only woman to be ranked in the region&#x27;s top-20 of the richest people in 2007. As of November 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated her fortune at US$4.6 billion, making her the 590th-wealthiest person in the world, and the fourth-wealthiest in Israel.

As of January 22, 2024, Forbes listed Shari Arison net worth at US$4.4 billion, ranking her 672 on the Billionaires list and she was ranked 8th among the top wealthiest people in Israel.

==Biography==
Arison was born in New York City, and is the daughter of the businessman Ted Arison, the founder of Carnival Cruise Lines, and Mina Arison Sapir. She has an older brother, Micky. In 1966 her parents divorced, and she moved to Israel to live with her mother. At the age of 12 she returned to the US to live with her father, and five years later she returned to Israel in order to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. In 1999 Arison&#x27;s father died, and bequeathed her 35% of his possessions.

In 2003, she was the target of protests after 900 workers were fired from Bank Hapoalim.

In March 2009, Arison sponsored Israel&#x27;s third annual &quot;Good Deeds Day&quot; in which her non-profit organization, Ruach Tova, inspired thousands of Israelis to get involved in volunteering across the country. As part of the event, which took place near Tel Aviv, a Palestinian youth orchestra performed in an hour-long concert in honor of Holocaust survivors. They played classical Arabic tunes and songs of peace, but upon the group&#x27;s return to Jenin, local Arab authorities condemned the orchestra&#x27;s leader for her &quot;exploitation of the children for political purposes.&quot; The event garnered worldwide media attention. Following the concert to celebrate &quot;Good Deeds Day&quot;, the orchestra conductor was expelled from her hometown of Jenin.

Arison was awarded the America–Israel Friendship League&#x27;s Partners for Democracy award in 2010, for her contribution to promoting the economies of Israel and the United States.

==Business activities==

<doc id="1318885" wikidata="Q7867495" url="?curid=1318885" title="USS Augusta (1853)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Augusta&quot; was a side-wheel steamer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was named for the city of Augusta, Georgia.

Designed and constructed by the noted American shipbuilder, William H. Webb, the second &quot;Augusta&quot; was launched on 30 September 1852 and later completed in 1853 at New York City and operated out of that port carrying passengers and freight for the New York and Savannah Steam Navigation Company on runs to Savannah, Georgia and New Orleans, Louisiana. Augusta also had a sister vessel by the name of Knoxville. Early in the Civil War, as the Union Navy was expanding its fleet for the Herculean task of blockading the Confederate coast, the Federal Government purchased the side-wheeler at New York on 1 August 1861. She was fitted out for naval service by the New York Navy Yard and commissioned there on 28 September 1861, Commander Enoch Greenleafe Parrott in command.

==Civil War operations==
A part of Flag Officer Samuel Francis du Pont&#x27;s newly established South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, &quot;Augusta&quot; was assigned to the task force then being formed to capture a naval base on the Confederacy&#x27;s Atlantic coast somewhere within the new squadron&#x27;s jurisdiction which stretched from the Florida Keys to the border separating North and South Carolina.

&quot;Augusta&quot; departed New York on 16 October, reached Hampton Roads two days later, remaining there while the other warships of Du Pont&#x27;s fleet assembled. When she sortied with them on 29 October, the captain of each ship carried sealed orders to be opened only in the event of the force&#x27;s separation. While the fleet of some 75 ships slowly sailed south, a storm arose in the wee hours of 31 October, shortly after &quot;Augusta&quot; passed Cape Hatteras. By 3:30 that afternoon, the wind had increased so greatly in violence that Du Pont signaled the commanding officer of the other ships that they were free to leave the formation and to proceed in whatever manner seemed most conducive to safety. While suffering varying amounts of damage as they battled the tempest, some ships were forced to turn back; two transports went to the bottom; but most continued on toward their original objectives.

As she proceeded south, &quot;Augusta&quot; – which had been steaming on the starboard flank of the transports – managed to weather the hurricane; and the wind had abated by the time she passed Charleston, South Carolina on 3 November. The next day, she reached an anchorage just off the bar outside Port Royal harbor. Two days were then spent in charting the nearby waters – from which all aids to navigation had been removed; in making reconnaissance probes to feel out the Confederate defensive forces and to locate their guns; and in seeing that the commander of each unit clearly understood his role in the forthcoming attack.

For the invasion, Du Pont divided his warships into two groups: a main squadron which was to bombard the Southern forts that defended the harbor and a flanking squadron which was to parry any attempted counterthrust by the Confederate fleet. &quot;Augusta&quot; was the last of the five ships composing the flanking group.

Fort Walker on Hilton Head – the stronger of the two defensive works protecting the harbor – was some across the water to the southwest from Fort Beauregard on Bay Point. Since this distance was great enough to prevent the guns of one fort from effectively supporting those of the other, Du Pont decided to engage the Southern positions, one at a time, beginning with the stronger, Fort Walker. Having learned that most of its guns faced south, the flag officer had his main squadron steam by the Hilton Head shore along a counterclockwise, elliptical path which kept its warships out of effective range of the Confederate batteries. Then, when it had reached a point beyond the traversing limit of these guns, this squadron began a turn to port along a wide arc which closed the shore as the Union ships opened fire on the fort and steamed back in the direction from which they had come. This maneuver prevented most of Fort Walker&#x27;s cannon from getting into action while leaving them almost completely exposed to the Federal salvoes.

Meanwhile, Du Pont&#x27;s flanking squadron – including &quot;Augusta&quot; – followed the main group into the harbor and took station to the northwest of this ellipse in position to turn back any Southern warships which attempted to enter the fray. They did not have long to wait. The small Confederate squadron – commanded by Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall III, CSN – soon steamed out and opened fire on &quot;Augusta&quot; and her consorts. However, the Union ships answered with a barrage that soon convinced Tattnall that his ships had more than met their match and compelled him to withdraw into Skull Creek. Nevertheless, Tattnall&#x27;s ships did aid the Southern cause by ferrying Fort Walker&#x27;s troops from Hilton Head to the mainland.

After driving off the Confederate squadron, the warships of Du Pont&#x27;s flanking squadron joined in the bombardment of Fort Walker. When was disabled by a shot from Hilton Head, &quot;Augusta&quot; took her in tow and enabled her to resume firing.

Unable to withstand the Union shelling, the Confederates evacuated Fort Walker which was soon occupied by Northern sailors and Marines. Du Pont then turned his attention to Fort Beauregard across the harbor and soon had it too in his hands.

Immediately after the battle, Du Pont ordered &quot;Augusta&quot; to sail for Savannah. She arrived off that port that same day, and reestablished the blockade which had been open since 1 November, when the hurricane had blown and out to sea. At the end of the second week of November, she accompanied on a reconnaissance of Tybee Island, which guarded the entrance to Savannah Harbor and found it to be abandoned. On 18 November, she reconnoitered Wassau Sound and reported that it must be covered if the blockade of Savannah were to be effective. Finally on the last day of November, &quot;Augusta&quot; aided &quot;Savannah&quot;, &quot;Flag&quot;, , , and in taking &quot;E. J. Waterman&quot; after she ran aground on Tybee Island.

The next day, 1 December, Du Pont ordered &quot;Augusta&quot; to Charleston for blockade duty, and she spent much of the next year and one-half as the flagship of the senior Union naval officer off that strongly defended city, the &quot;birthplace of secession.&quot; On 6 December, she took the British blockade runner &quot;Cheshire&quot; – of and from Liverpool – some southeast of Tybee Light. She towed the captured vessel as far north as Charleston and then sent her on to New York under a prize crew for adjudication.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, she captured &quot;Island Belle&quot; about southeast of Bull&#x27;s Island light. Laden with sugar and molasses, that schooner of Nassau, New Providence, had departed Trinidad de Cuba ostensibly bound for Baltimore, Maryland under English colors. However, the vessel – which had been built at Charleston earlier that year under the name, &quot;General Ripley&quot; – was heading straight for Bull&#x27;s Bay. Since her British registration – dated 11 November 1861 – seemed to be a subterfuge and her clearance was obviously spurious, Parrott sent the prize to New York.

One of &quot;Augusta&quot;″s more interesting experiences during the war occurred on the morning of 13 May 1862 when the Confederate armed steamer steamed out of Charleston harbor. This vessel had been used by the Confederate Army as a transport and dispatch boat. While &quot;Planter&quot; had been moored to a wharf in Charleston and her captain was ashore, her pilot – a slave named Robert Smalls – had embarked his family and a few friends and quietly slipped out to sea. When &quot;Planter&quot; had passed beyond range of the last Southern gun, Smalls lowered her Confederate colors and hoisted a white flag, before steaming up to the Union clipper ship and surrendering. His brave deed brought freedom to himself, seven other black men, five women, and three children. The following day, Parrott – the senior naval officer of Charleston – sent &quot;Planter&quot; to Port Royal where Du Pont took her into the Union Navy.

On the night of 24–25 May, the inbound steamer &quot;Kate&quot; dashed past the Union blockaders off Charleston but ran ashore under the protection of Confederate guns. In the morning, &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; tried to destroy the blockade runner by gunfire; but heavy seas and fire from Southern shore batteries prevented their succeeding. During the half-hour the Union ships were under fire, Confederate shells passed overhead and between &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; but none scored. On the other hand, although raised to their maximum elevation, the Union guns were unable to reach shore. This failure dramatically demonstrated &quot;Augusta&quot;″s need for heavier guns.

The following day, &quot;Augusta&quot; and chased a runner named &quot;Cambria&quot;. &quot;Huron &quot;captured that steamer which had departed Nassau, cleared for Saint John, New Brunswick, but was obviously headed for Charleston.

On 18 June, Du Pont ordered Parrott to move to Wassau Sound where &quot;Augusta&quot; labored to close that approach to Savannah until Flag relieved her at the end of the first week of July. Parrott then took his ship back to Charleston and by mid-month was again the senior officer blockading that strategic port.

But her hard service had taken a toll on &quot;Augusta&quot; and had been especially hard on her engines. On 5 August, Lieutenant Daniel Ammen – who had recently participated in a survey of the ship – felt that repairing her might well cost more than constructing a new ship. Instead of repairing her, he suggested that her bow be reinforced so that she could be used as a ram to destroy , a Southern ironclad ram at Savannah. This recommendation was not followed – probably because the Union Navy still needed more warships for blockade duty, and because &quot;Augusta&quot;.had established a wide reputation for her outstanding sea-keeping ability. Instead, on 27 August, Du Pont sent her North for repairs. In his orders to Parrott, Du Pont – now an acting rear admiral – expressed his &quot;... very sincere approbation and appreciation of the services rendered by &quot;Augusta&quot; on this station. He went on to point out that &quot;... no vessel has seen more outside blockade service and has been less in port, and whose fires have been so seldom drawn.&quot;

Two days later, &quot;Augusta&quot; – towing &quot;Seneca&quot; – departed Port Royal. Upon her arrival at Philadelphia on 3 September, Parrott commented, &quot;The &quot;Augusta&quot; is the best sea boat I have ever seen; is fast, and, having very little motion, the steadiness of her decks aids very much the accuracy of her fire. I think her well worthy of an improved battery and a thorough outfit.&quot; The ship was decommissioned on 17 September, and the Philadelphia Navy Yard gave her a speedy overhaul so that she might get to sea in pursuit of the Confederate commerce raider which had recently been preying upon Union shipping in the North Atlantic.

Recommissioned on 31 October, &quot;Augusta&quot; received orders the next day to get underway for a cruise &quot;... via Bermuda and St. Thomas through the Windward Islands and along the coast of South America ...&quot; to seek out and to destroy Capt. Raphael Semmes&#x27; elusive cruiser. However, engine trouble kept her in port and others went out instead.

On 5 November, &quot;Augusta&quot; was assigned a different mission, convoy duty for a group of transports which were to carry Army troops to the Gulf of Mexico to reinforce those already there under Major General Benjamin F. Butler. Four days later, General Nathaniel Banks received orders to command these troops and upon arrival at New Orleans, to relieve Butler in command of the Department of the Gulf.

When she was finally ready for sea, &quot;Augusta&quot; proceeded to Hampton Roads and there awaited Banks&#x27; transports. The convoy – which was not complete until early in December – sortied from the Virginia Capes on the fourth. While the Union ships were &quot;en route&quot; south, a fierce storm partially dispersed them; but &quot;Augusta&quot; managed to remain with most of Banks&#x27; transports. This group arrived at Ship Island (Mississippi) on 13 December.

After Parrott had delivered his charges, &quot;Augusta&quot; headed back to the East Coast. At the request of General Banks, she touched, &quot;en route&quot;, at Havana, Cuba, and at Key West to inquire about the stray ships of the convoy that had not yet reported. She also replenished her coal bunkers at the latter port; but, before she could resume her voyage to Port Royal to rejoin her squadron, she received new orders from Rear Admiral Theodoras Bailey.

On 22 December, Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s California mail steamer &quot;Ariel&quot; had steamed into Key West with word that – as she was steaming from New York toward Panama, she had been captured off the coast of Cuba by CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and had been released on ransom. Her master had urged that the Navy henceforth escort &quot;Ariel&quot; and her sister mail steamers, especially those heading north from the isthmus with shipments of bullion from the California gold fields. On Christmas Day, Bailey directed Parrott to proceed to Aspinwall and to offer convoy or such other assistance to such steamers as may be necessary.

&quot;Augusta&quot; got underway immediately and, after completing this important mission, finally reported for duty to Du Pont at Port Royal on 18 January 1863. Following coaling and replenishment, she sailed for Charleston to relieve on blockade duty.

On 29 January, her boat crews joined those of in assisting officers of in refloating the iron-hulled screw steamer . &quot;Unadilla &quot;had forced her aground while that blockade runner was attempting to slip into Charleston with a cargo of arms and ammunition as well as an unrecorded number of large rifled naval guns and two powerful steam engines slated to be installed in Southern ironclads then under construction.

In the early morning fog of the last day of January, the Confederate ironclads and steamed out of Charleston and attacked the Union blockading fleet. &quot;Palmetto State&quot; rammed and fired into , reducing that Federal screw gunboat to &quot;... a sinking and perfectly defenseless condition.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Chicora&quot; engaged . One round burst the Northern side-wheeler&#x27;s boiler, releasing scalding steam which killed one officer and 19 men and disabled another score of bluejackets.

When the Southern warships first emerged, &quot;Augusta&quot; was &quot;... lying off the Swash Channel and saw flashes to the southward and westward and heard a few reports.&quot; Since gunfire at night was not unusual, Parrott concluded that some vessel was probably attempting to run the blockade. He followed longstanding instructions and kept &quot;Augusta&quot; on station, on the lookout.

At the first sign of dawn, , next in line to the southward of &quot;Augusta&quot;, got underway and began firing. Parrott soon saw black smoke rising in the direction of the action, signaled the senior officer present – in &quot;Housatonic&quot;, next in line to the northward – that an enemy was present, and stood to the southward. A short while later, the two Southern ironclads passed successively between &quot;Augusta&quot; and the shore. During the exchange of fire, a nine-inch Southern shell entered &quot;Augusta&quot;″s starboard side, passed just above her boiler, and lodged in her port side. &quot;Housatonic&quot; and also engaged the Confederate ironclads before the secessionist warships retired into the entrance to Maffitt&#x27;s Channel.

But for occasional short runs to Port Royal to replenish her provisions and to refill her coal bunkers or to tow vessels to other points within the limits of her squadron, &quot;Augusta&quot; labored into the summer to tighten the blockade of Charleston during the ensuing months. Then, on 5 July, Du Pont – who was to be relieved of command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren – ordered Parrott &quot;... to prepare the &quot;Augusta&quot; for sea, as I propose to go to the Delaware in your vessel.&quot; The transfer of command took place the next day on board the and, once Du Pont had embarked in &quot;Augusta&quot;, she sailed for the Delaware Capes. After dropping off her former squadron commander at New Castle, the steamer proceeded upstream and arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 10 July.

The next day, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles wired Commodore Cornelius Stribling, the commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, orders for &quot;Augusta&quot; &quot;... to make a cruise to the fishing banks ...&quot; CSS &quot;Florida&quot; – commanded by Cdr. John N. Maffitt – had recently been terrorizing Union shipping in the North Atlantic, and &quot;Augusta&quot; was sent out to join in the hunt for that Confederate commerce raider. As soon as she had finished coaling, the Union steamer put to sea and spent the rest of the month looking in vain for Florida. His inquiries of vessels and at visited ports prompted Parrott to conclude that the Southern cruiser had left the northwestern Atlantic more than a fortnight before. Welles was also convinced that Maffitt had sought warmer waters. As a result, soon after she arrived at the New York Navy Yard on the last day of July, &quot;Augusta&quot; was decommissioned for the long overdue complete overhaul that had first been interrupted by CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s antics in the North Atlantic some nine months before.

The veteran steamer was not again ready for action until the following spring, and she was recommissioned on 12 May 1864, Cdr. Thomas G. Corbin in command. Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, she arrived at Hampton Roads on the evening of 4 June. Following brief blockade duty off Wilmington, North Carolina, she returned to Hampton Roads to prepare to escort the monitor to the Gulf of Mexico for Adm. Farragut&#x27;s forthcoming attack on Mobile Bay. She, , and the ill-fated monitor departed Hampton Roads on 5 July. The decision to send two escorts to tow &quot;Tecumseh&quot; proved to be a wise one, since all three ships suffered engine trouble during the voyage; but, by helping each other, the trio finally reached Pensacola on 28 July.

&quot;Augusta&quot; remained at that port undergoing repairs to her machinery while the monitor moved to Mobile Bay to participate in the historic battle on 5 August which brought her short career to a tragic close. When the yard work was finished, the steamer sailed north on 3 September and arrived back at Hampton Roads on 12 September and she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard to have her hull scraped before resuming duty. She returned to service in October and was assigned to the squadron&#x27;s third division.

However, before the month ended, engine trouble forced &quot;Augusta&quot; to New York for repairs. Before this work could be accomplished, the Navy Department became aware of renewed and intensified threats to the security of the California mail steamers from Confederate cruisers and from groups of Southern passengers who were plotting to seize these ships. To help in countering these dangers, &quot;Augusta&quot; – the only vessel available at New York for convoy duty – departed that port on the morning of 6 November in the wake of &quot;North Star&quot;, about two and one-half days after that steamer had sailed for Panama. Upon reaching Panama &quot;Augusta&quot; was to escort North Star back home. She arrived at Aspinwall on the morning of 16 November and, two days later, followed her charge out to sea. With great difficulty, she managed to keep &quot;North Star&quot; in sight for over three days; but, on the evening of 21 November, a loud and vibrant thump developed in her engine. She followed &quot;North Star&quot; to the Bahamas: and both ships stopped at Mathew Town, Great Inagua, in that island group. There, engineers inspected &quot;Augusta&quot;″s machinery and confirmed that the piston rod was loose. Nevertheless, the commanding officers of the vessels decided to proceed north. About an hour after midnight on 25 November, the loose piston and rod separated with a violent concussion. The failure irreparably cracked the cylinder, utterly disabling &quot;Augusta&quot;″s engine.

&quot;North Star&quot; towed her escort to Port Royal, South Carolina, where the two ships arrived on 28 November, and then proceeded on north alone. Cdr. Corbin was unable to arrange for a tow until the afternoon of 8 December when the Army transport &quot;Arago&quot; undertook the task. Bad weather plagued both ships as they fought their way northward, but they reached Hampton Roads safely on the evening of 12 December. There, General Butler forbade the master of the &quot;Arago&quot; to continue towing &quot;Augusta&quot; to New York, probably because he felt that she would be needed in the impending attack upon Fort Fisher. Somehow, Cdr. Corbin managed to arrange for a vessel which towed his ship to Baltimore. After she finally reached that port, &quot;Augusta&quot; was decommissioned on 6 January 1865.

==Political operations==
Despite the seriousness of the ship&#x27;s damage, the Navy decided to keep &quot;Augusta&quot; because of her outstanding sea-keeping qualities. Nevertheless, the fighting had ended before the steamer was again ready for service. By that time, the Government was cutting the Fleet back to peacetime size, so the ship remained in reserve until the spring of 1866, a year after the collapse of the Confederacy.

&quot;Augusta&quot; was recommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 2 April 1866, Cdr. Alexander Murray in command. A fortnight later, she received orders to proceed to New York; and she arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 23 April. On 5 May, she stood out into the Atlantic in company with the double-turreted monitor and the side-wheel, double-ended gunboat . Two days later, &quot;Ashuelot&quot; left the group and set course for Boston where she embarked Gustavus Vasa Fox, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. &quot;Augusta&quot; and the monitor arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 10 May and there, Murray later reported, received &quot;. . . the first flow of that tide of visitors which, wherever we went, overwhelmed us.&quot; Underway again on 18 May, the two ships arrived at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on 24 May. &quot;Ashuelot&quot; rejoined the group there on 3 June.

The cruise the three ships were about to begin was undertaken to serve several purposes. First, it carried Mr. Fox to Russia as President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s personal representative and as the bearer of a resolution of Congress congratulating Tsar Alexander II for his escape from the attack of a nihilist assassin. The United States also wished to express to the Tsar its appreciation for Russia&#x27;s warm – albeit unofficial – support of the Union cause during the Civil War, especially of the Russian Fleet&#x27;s friendly visit to Union controlled waters during the conflict.

Secondly, the cruise was made to show the world&#x27;s naval powers the Nation&#x27;s innovation in warship design, the monitor, and to demonstrate its ability to operate in the open sea. Finally, the operation was an effort to cultivate friendly relations with all of the nations visited – an early example of the Navy&#x27;s &quot;show-the-flag&quot; policy.

The flotilla departed St. John&#x27;s on 5 June and reached Queenstown, Ireland on 16 June. &quot;Ashuelot&quot; parted from the group at that port. The two remaining warships headed for England on 21 June; and, during the ensuing year visited most of the maritime countries of Europe and, in every case, received enthusiastically friendly hospitality from royalty and commoners alike. The highlight of the cruise was the visit to Russia which began upon the warships&#x27; arrival at Helsingfors (Helsinki) on 3 August. Finland was then an autonomous duchy owing allegiance to the Tsar. Three days later, the pair reached Kronstadt, the port serving St. Petersburg and the Americans, home-away-from-home for more than a month in which they enjoyed the warmest of welcomes. The Tsar and members of the Russian royal family visited the ships on 9 August. Lavish entertainment on board the royal yacht, sightseeing tours, and an inspection of the Russian Fleet filled the ensuing days until &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Miantonomoh&quot; got underway again on 15 September and headed for Stockholm.

Besides their four days in Sweden, the Americans visited Germany – including the port of Kiel in the King of Prussia&#x27;s newly acquired province of Schleswig-Holstein-France, Portugal, and Spain before they transited the Strait of Gibraltar two days before Christmas. They welcomed in the new year, 1867, at Málaga, Spain, and spent the next four and one-half months visiting the traditionally popular ports of call in the Mediterranean before departing Gibraltar on 15 May and heading home, via the Canary Islands, the Cape Verdes, Barbados, and the Bahamas. Following a week at Nassau, they began the final passage of the cruise on 17 July and moored in the Philadelphia Navy Yard on the 22nd. Soon thereafter, &quot;Augusta&quot; was laid up in the New York Navy Yard and remained there until sold at auction on 2 December 1868 to &quot;Commodore&quot; Cornelius Kingsland Garrison.

==Civilian operations==
Redocumented as &quot;Magnolia&quot; on 23 December, the steamer was completely reconditioned and then operated out of New York to Charleston and Florida ports. In 1872, Garrison sold her to the Central Georgia Railway and Banking Co. for whom she continued to operate on the same route. Two years later, this corporation organized the Ocean Steamship Company as a subsidiary and gave the new firm all of its ships including &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

On 27 September 1877, &quot;Magnolia&quot; departed Savannah and headed for New York. Two days out, a severe storm arose imperiling the ship. Before dawn the next morning, the vessel began taking on water faster than her pumps could expel it. Soon the engine room floor collapsed and, by 8:00 a.m., rising water put out the boiler&#x27;s fires. After a futile struggle to pump out and bail out the ship, the master ordered the crew to abandon ship. No one was lost or injured in the sinking. The Magnolia has never been found.

<text>Karl-Heinz Kipp (12 February 1924 – 11 October 2017) was a German billionaire, and founder of the department store chain. He sold the business but kept the property, and had a large property portfolio. In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net wealth at US$4.9 billion.

==Career==
Kipp began his career in 1948 selling clothes and opened his first Massa department store in 1965. At the beginning of the 1970s Kipp built the first large-scale consumer market on a &quot;greenfield site&quot;. Within a few years, 30 more Massa supermarkets followed in southwestern Germany. In 1981, Kipp introduced financial shopping. In 1986, the Massa supermarkets shares went public. In 1987, Kipp sold his remaining shares but kept the real estate, which he rented to the retailer Metro AG.

=== Real estate ===
Kipp owned real estate in the U.S., including 950 Third Avenue in Manhattan.

In 1980 Kipp acquired the five-star Tschuggen Grand Hotel in Arosa. In addition, he owned five Swiss hotels and resorts in his &quot;Tschuggen Hotel Group&quot;, including the Hotel Eden Roc in Ascona, the Carlton Hotel in St Moritz and the Tschuggen Grand Hotel in Arosa.

==Personal life==
Kipp and his wife, Hannelore resided in Arosa, Switzerland.

His son, former Florida resident Ernst-Ludwig Kipp, died in 2003, leaving behind his seven children. His daughter Ursula married Dr Wilfried Bechtolsheimer and together they have three sons, Felix (a singer with the rock group Hey Negrita), Goetz, and Till (the founder of Arosa Capital Management and amateur racing driver who competes in the 2021 IMSA SportsCar Championship), and a daughter, Laura, an Olympic dressage rider.

<doc id="1318899" wikidata="Q450987" url="?curid=1318899" title="Spiros Latsis">
<text>Spiros J. Latsis (; born 1946) is a Greek billionaire and business magnate. He is the son of the late tycoon Yiannis Latsis, who died in 2003. In 2018, Spiros Latsis ranked #729 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; World&#x27;s Billionaires list, with wealth listed at US $3.2 billion.

==Early life==
Spiro Latsis is the son of Yiannis Latsis and Erietta Tsoukala. He has two sisters, Marianna and Margarita Latsis. He was educated at the London School of Economics (LSE) where, in 1968, he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. In 1970, he received a master&#x27;s degree in logic and scientific method. He went on to pursue his doctorate and obtained a PhD in philosophy from the LSE in 1974. His doctoral advisor was Imre Lakatos.

==Career and family business==
His father John Latsis started building the family fortune in 1938 as a trader and later a ship-owner. He grew his business into a fleet of ships by the 1960s. He built up a number of business interests in the areas of shipping, real estate, construction and oil, plus banking and finance. Latsis joined the family business initially in the banking arm.

From 1989, Latsis became a director of some companies within the EFG Group, the family banking Holding Group, including Private Financial Holdings Limited which became EFG Private Bank Limited in London, and EFG Consolidated Holding SA in Luxembourg. The following year, he also assumed the role of director of Eurofinanciere d&#x27;Investissements SAM in Monaco and became a non-Executive Director of Eurobank Ergasias SA in Athens. Dr Latsis officially assumed the role of Chairman of the EFG Group in 1997.

After the death of his father in 2003, Latsis took over the direction of the Latsis Group of companies. Since that time, Latsis, while remaining Chairman of EFG Bank (the family bank holding company) has become a director of EFG International and Consolidated Lamda Holdings, serves as President of Societe d&#x27;Etudes et Economiques in Geneva, and is Chairman of several other companies including Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings S.A. in Luxembourg.

In 2015 Latsis was the second wealthiest Greek, ranked #782 on the 2015 Forbes list of the world&#x27;s richest people. Latsis saw his wealth significantly decline during Greece&#x27;s recession, with stocks of his EFG Eurobank, Lamda Development and Hellenic Petroleum all falling significantly in 2011, but recovered in 2013. Latsis invited the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, who had been a student friend at the University of Geneva, to be a guest on his yacht. Subsequently, allegations were made in the press that this influenced the Commissions decisions but Barroso dismissed those.

In 2020 Latsis was officially dropped off by the Forbes world&#x27;s richest people list.

==Business interests==
The family&#x27;s largest holding is its EFG Bank European Financial Group in Luxembourg, a private banking group that operates in many jurisdictions. The Group holds over 40% of EFG International listed in Switzerland on the Zurich Stock Exchange, which is a global private banking group offering private banking and asset management services. EFGI&#x27;s group of private banking businesses operates in around 30 locations worldwide, with 3,151 employees and manages CHF153.8bn of client assets as of December 2019.

The Latsis family fortune, managed by Spiro Latsis, includes more than 42% in Hellenic Petroleum, a major petroleum player in Southern Europe, through its ownership of Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings S.A.. The Latsis group also controls Lamda Development, a real estate group based in Athens. Lamda Development projects include The Mall Athens, which opened in 2005, and Golden Hall Mall, also in Athens. Latsis also started PrivateAir, a jet charter service with over 50 planes in its repertoire serving affluent European and American travelers, and which he has since sold.

==Controversies==
===Swiss Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office investigation===
In June 2024, it was reported that the family office of Spiros Latsis in Geneva had been raided in November 2023 as part of a Swiss Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office inquiry into suspected money laundering and bribery cases. According to the Swiss website Gotham City, the investigation involved two companies controlled by the Latsis family: Hardstone Services SA and Société d&#x27;études techniques et économiques (SETE) SA, which manages the Latsis family&#x27;s assets.

The investigation, which began on 15 January 2020, reportedly concerns suspected bribery of Fahad Al Rajaan, the former director of Kuwait&#x27;s Public Institution for Social Security (PIFSS). Al Rajaan, who is now deceased, allegedly received commissions in exchange for awarding mandates to manage public funds to several Swiss banks. The companies SETE SA and Hardstone Services SA are alleged to have paid commissions to offshore companies, with some funds allegedly ending up in an account of a person who was a front for Al Rajaan in the Bahamas.

According to SETE&#x27;s press release and statements from their legal representative, neither Spiros Latsis nor the two companies under investigation are directly involved in the investigation or have been charged with any offense by the Swiss Federal Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office.

==Honours, recognition, and philanthropy==
In 2006 Latsis received an honorary doctorate from Witten/Herdecke University in Witten, Germany recognizing his work in the field of economics.

In addition to his various business holdings, Latsis (with his family) helps to fund the John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation and the International Latsis Foundation in Geneva. In 2012, he transferred around $300 million of his Greek banking stock holdings to various members of the Latsis family, with a contribution also going to the Foundation.

The John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation helps to fund programs in the areas of education, scientific research, social welfare, and culture. The Geneva Foundation funds five scientific awards per annum as well as a number of conferences at the Swiss Polytechnic Institutes in Lausanne and Zurich as well as the University of Geneva.

<doc id="1318903" wikidata="Q982853" url="?curid=1318903" title="Albert J. Beveridge">
<text>Albert Jeremiah Beveridge (October 6, 1862 – April 27, 1927) was an American historian and United States Senator from Indiana. He was an intellectual leader of the Progressive Era and a biographer of Chief Justice John Marshall and President Abraham Lincoln.

==Early years==
Beveridge was born on October 6, 1862, in Highland County, Ohio, near Sugar Tree Ridge; his parents moved to Indiana soon after his birth. Both of his parents, Thomas H. and Frances Parkinson, were of English descent. His childhood was one of hard work and labor. Beveridge graduated from Sullivan Township High School in 1881. Securing an education with difficulty, he eventually became a law clerk in Indianapolis. In 1887, he was admitted to the Indiana bar, practiced law in Indianapolis and married Katherine Langsdale. After Katherine&#x27;s death in 1900, Beveridge married Catherine Eddy in 1907.

Beveridge graduated from Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in 1885, with a Ph.B. degree. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He was known as a compelling orator, delivering speeches supporting territorial expansion by the US and increasing the power of the federal government.

Beveridge was a Freemason and a member of Oriental Lodge No. 500 in Indianapolis.

==Political career==
Beveridge entered politics in 1884 by speaking on behalf of presidential candidate James G. Blaine and was prominent in later campaigns, particularly in 1896, when his speeches attracted general attention. In 1899, Beveridge was appointed to the U.S. Senate as a Republican and served until 1911. He supported Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s progressive views and was the keynote speaker at the new Progressive Party convention which nominated Roosevelt for U.S. President in 1912.

Beveridge is known as one of the most prominent American imperialists. He supported the annexation of the Philippines and, along with Republican leader Henry Cabot Lodge, campaigned for the construction of a new navy. In 1901, Beveridge became chair of the Senate Committee on Territories, which allowed him to support statehood for Oklahoma. However, he blocked statehood for New Mexico and Arizona because he deemed the territories too sparsely occupied by white people. In his opinion, they contained too many Hispanics and Native Americans, whom he described as intellectually incapable of understanding the concept of self-governance. He celebrated the &quot;white man&#x27;s burden&quot; as a noble mission, part of God&#x27;s plan to bring civilization to the entire world: &quot;It is racial... He has marked the American people as His chosen nation...&quot;

After Beveridge&#x27;s election in 1905 to a second term, he became identified with the reform-minded faction of the Republican Party. He championed national child labor legislation, broke with President William Howard Taft over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, and sponsored the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906, adopted in the wake of the publication of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;. Furthermore, Beveridge joined insurgents in supporting postal savings bank legislation and railroad regulations with the Mann–Elkins Act of 1910.

During the 1908 Republican Convention, the vice-presidential nomination was urged upon Beveridge by Frank Hitchcock as manager of Taft&#x27;s campaign, by Senator Reed Smoot of Utah, and by the Nebraska delegation, but Beveridge refused.

He lost his Senate seat to John Worth Kern when the Democrats took Indiana in the 1910 elections. In 1912, when Roosevelt left the Republican Party to found the short-lived Progressive Party, Beveridge left with him and ran campaigns as that party&#x27;s Indiana nominee in the 1912 race for governor and the 1914 race for senator, losing both. When the Progressive Party disintegrated, Beveridge returned to the Republicans with his political future in tatters; he eventually ran one more race for the Senate in 1922, winning the primary against incumbent Harry S. New but losing the general to Samuel M. Ralston. Beveridge would never again hold office. Another contribution towards his political downfall was the fact he was a great critic of Woodrow Wilson. He encouraged Wilson to take a more interventionist policy with the Mexican Revolution but disliked Wilson&#x27;s League of Nations, which Beveridge felt would undermine American independence.

In the twilight of his life, Beveridge came to repudiate some of the earlier expansion of governmental power that he had championed in his earlier career. In one notable address, delivered before the Sons of the Revolution&#x27;s annual dinner in June 1923, Beveridge decried the growth of the regulatory state and the proliferation of regulatory bodies, bureaus and commissions. &quot;America would be better off as a country and Americans happier and more prosperous as a people,&quot; he suggested, &quot;if half of our Government boards, bureaus and commissions were abolished, hundreds of thousands of our Government officials, agents and employees were discharged and two-thirds of our Government regulations, restrictions and inhibitions were removed.&quot;

==Historian==
As his political career drew to a close, Beveridge dedicated his time to writing scholarly biographies. He was a member and secretary of the American Historical Association (AHA). His four-volume biography of John Marshall, &quot;The Life of John Marshall&quot;, published in 1916–1919, won Beveridge a Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and connected events in John Marshall&#x27;s life with his later rulings on the U.S. Supreme Court.

Beveridge spent most of his final years writing a four-volume biography of Abraham Lincoln, only half-finished at his death, posthumously published in 1928 as &quot;Abraham Lincoln, 1809–1858&quot; (2 vols.). It stripped away the myths and revealed a complex and imperfect politician. In 1939, the AHA established the Beveridge Award in his memory through a gift from his widow and from donations from members.

==Tolstoy film==
In 1901, a decade before Leo Tolstoy died, American travel lecturer Burton Holmes visited Yasnaya Polyana with Beveridge. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm camera. Afterwards, Beveridge&#x27;s advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that evidence of his having met with a radical Russian author might hurt his chances of running for the presidency.

==Death==
Beveridge died from a heart attack in Indianapolis on April 27, 1927, and was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery.

<text>George Bruce Kaiser (born July 29, 1942) is an American billionaire businessman. He is the chairman of BOK Financial Corporation in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As of September 2021, he is the 476th richest person in the world and was, in 2012, one of the top 50 American philanthropists.

==Early life==
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He attended Central High School in Tulsa. He earned a BA from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966. He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser&#x27;s uncle and parents, Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.

George&#x27;s father, Herman George Kaiser, had been an attorney in the district of the Kammergericht in Berlin until 1933, when he was dismissed by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife Kate then moved to Rostock where Herman Kaiser worked with his father-in-law Max Samuel&#x27;s EMSA-Werke company. Herman Kaiser escaped to England in 1937 and his wife and daughter came over in September the following year. In 1940 all three emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman&#x27;s aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle&#x27;s oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa. Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992, at the age of 88.

==Career==
===Oil and gas===
Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George&#x27;s management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.

===Banking===
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK&#x27;s depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. He owns 61.5 percent of BOK. As of 2007, Kaiser&#x27;s ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Kaiser&#x27;s net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world. As of 2023, George&#x27;s net worth was estimated at $13.3 billion.

===Professional sports===
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward&#x27;s interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Oklahoma City Blue minor league affiliate.

== Personal life==
Kaiser&#x27;s nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.

Kaiser has been married twice:
* His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library&#x27;s literacy program. Betty died in 2002. The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.
* His second wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of 108 Contemporary. She is the daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist Charles Goodall, known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations. The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.

Kaiser is affiliated with the Egalitarian Conservative Congregation B&#x27;Nai Emunah.

Kaiser avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.

== Philanthropy ==
Kaiser is listed third on &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;&#x27;s 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people. He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education. Kaiser&#x27;s family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa&#x27;s historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.

Kaiser&#x27;s family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles. and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson. In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.

The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa&#x27;s Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university&#x27;s Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.

The Kaiser family foundation is responsible for the initial funding leading to Tulsa&#x27;s A Gathering Place. This park is the largest privately funded park project in the United States. The foundation&#x27;s donation amounted to $350 million.

Kaiser&#x27;s family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California, on September 6, 2011.

Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.

Kaiser&#x27;s philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in &quot;Forbes&quot; quoted him as saying &quot;Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.&quot;

The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students&#x27; tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.

Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.

Kaiser&#x27;s philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is &quot;naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose.&quot;

== Political activities ==
A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.

Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama. At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.

A 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser&#x27;s business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.

<text>Sunil Bharti Mittal (born 23 October 1957) is an Indian industrialist and philanthropist. He is the founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises, which has diversified interests in telecom, insurance, real estate, education, malls, hospitality, Agri and food besides other ventures.

Bharti Airtel, the group&#x27;s flagship company is one of the world&#x27;s largest and India&#x27;s largest telecom company with operations in 18 countries across Asia and Africa with a customer base of over 399 million. Bharti Airtel clocked revenues of over in FY2023. In 2023 he was ranked the 10th richest person in India by &quot;Forbes&quot;, with an estimated net worth of .

In October 2024, Sunil Mittal was ranked seventh on Forbes list of India’s 100 richest tycoons, with a net worth of $30.7 billion.

In 2007, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian honor. On 15 June 2016, he was elected as Chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce.

==Early life==
Sunil Bharti Mittal was born in Ludhiana, Punjab into an Agarwal family. His father, Sat Pal Mittal, had been a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha (Indian National Congress) from Ludhiana, Punjab. He first joined the Wynberg Allen School in Mussoorie, but later attended Scindia School at Gwalior and he graduated in 1976 from Panjab University, Chandigarh, with a Bachelor of Arts and Science for which he studied in Arya College, Ludhiana. His father died of cardiac arrest in 1992.

==Entrepreneurial ventures==
A first-generation entrepreneur, Sunil started his first business in April 1976 at the age of 18, with a capital investment of borrowed from his father. His first business was to make crankshafts for local bicycle manufacturers.

In 1980, he along with his brothers Rakesh Mittal and Rajan Mittal started an Import Enterprise named Bharti Overseas Trading Company. He sold his bicycle parts and yarn factories and moved to Mumbai. In 1981, he purchased importing licenses from exporting companies in Punjab. He then imported thousands of Suzuki Motors&#x27;s portable electric-power generators from Japan. The importing of generators was suddenly banned by the then Indian Government.

In 1984, he started assembling push-button phones in India, which he earlier used to import from a Taiwan company, Kingtel, replacing the old fashioned, bulky rotary phones that were in use in the country then. Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) was incorporated and entered into a technical tie up with Siemens AG of Germany for the manufacture of electronic push button phones. By the early 1990s, Sunil was making fax machines, cordless phones and other telecom gear. Sunil says, &quot;In 1983, the government imposed a ban on the import of gensets. I was out of business overnight. Everything I was doing came to a screeching halt. I was in trouble. The question then was: what should I do next? Then, opportunity came calling. While in Taiwan, I noticed the popularity of the push-button phone – something which India hadn&#x27;t seen then. We were still using those rotary dials with no speed dials or redials. I sensed my chance and embraced the telecom business. I started marketing telephones, answering/fax machines under the brand name Beetel and the company picked up really fast.&quot;. He named his first push-button phones as &#x27;Mitbrau&#x27;.

In 1992, he successfully bid for one of the four mobile phone network licenses auctioned in India. One of the conditions for the Delhi cellular license was that the bidder have some experience as a telecom operator. So, Mittal clinched a deal with the French telecom group Vivendi. He was one of the first Indian entrepreneurs to identify the mobile telecom business as a major growth area. His plans were finally approved by the Government in 1994 and he launched services in Delhi in 1995, when Bharti Cellular Limited (BCL) was formed to offer cellular services under the brand name AirTel in 1997. Within a few years Bharti became the first telecom company to cross the 2-million mobile subscriber mark. Bharti also brought down the STD/ISD cellular rates in India under brand name &#x27;Indiaone&#x27;.

In May 2008, it emerged that Sunil Bharti Mittal was exploring the possibility of buying the MTN Group, a South Africa-based telecommunications company with coverage in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East. &quot;The Financial Times&quot; reported that Bharti was considering offering US$45 billion for a 100% stake in MTN, which would be the largest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian firm. However, both sides emphasize the tentative nature of the talks, while &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine noted, &quot;If anything, Bharti would be marrying up,&quot; as MTN has more subscribers, higher revenues and broader geographic coverage. However, the talks fell apart as MTN group tried to reverse the negotiations by making Bharti almost a subsidiary of the new company. In May 2009, Bharti Airtel again confirmed that it was in talks with MTN and the companies agreed to discuss the potential transaction exclusively by 31 July 2009. Talks eventually ended without agreement, some sources stating that this was due to opposition from the South African government.

In June 2010, Bharti led by Mittal acquired the African business of Zain Telecom for $10.7 billion (enterprise value) making it the largest ever acquisition by an Indian telecom firm. In 2012, Bharti tied up with Wal-Mart, the US retail giant, to start a number of retail stores across India. In 2014, Bharti planned to acquire Loop Mobile for INR 7 billion, but the deal was called off later. His son Kavin Bharti Mittal is the CEO and founder of hike Messenger.

In September 2010, Mittal&#x27;s son, Shravin Mittal, joined Bharti Airtel as a manager having worked for Merrill Lynch in New York and Ernst &amp; Young in London.

In 2012, Mittal took Bharti Infratel public with an IPO that raised $760 million. Mittal noted that the sale, considered by many to be only a modest success, was a &quot;strong endorsement from qualified investors&quot;. The board was restructured ahead of the IPO with Mittal remaining as Chairman and Managing Director. After the IPO, shares of Bharti Infratel dropped sharply at the commencement of trading.

In 2013, Mittal was ordered to appear before a special Delhi court to answer questions about the additional allocation of airwaves to certain companies. Allegations against Mittal state that there had been collusion with key telecoms officials in the government to illegally secure an extra spectrum. No charges were issued against Mittal, however the trial court judge noted that there was enough material on record to proceed.

In late 2013, Mittal announced the acquisition of Warid Congo, making Bharti Airtel the largest telecoms provider in the Republic of Congo.

In 2015, Sunil Mittal announced that he would be joining the board of Oneweb, a space internet company. Mittal was one of the investors in a $500 million investment round that included Coca-Cola, Virgin and Qualcomm.

In 2016, Mittal made changes at Bharti Airtel to enable the company to compete against the launch of Jio. in the race to become India&#x27;s largest telecom company.

In 2017, Mittal announced &quot;war on roaming&quot; by scrapping charges for outgoing and incoming calls within India as well as international roaming charges.

==Philanthropy==
Mittal has also been working towards educating India through the Bharti Foundation, which is the philanthropic arm of Bharti Enterprises. The Foundation has established schools in villages across India and offers free quality education with free books, uniform and mid day meals to poor children.

Satya Bharti School Program&#x27; – the Foundation&#x27;s flagship program is running 254 schools in six States serving over 45,000 rural children, free of cost. The other educational initiatives including the – Satya Bharti School, Quality Support and Learning Centre Programs, are currently reaching out to over underprivileged children in 11 states. Other Program of the Foundation making considerable impact among the underprivileged sections is – &#x27;Satya Bharti Abhiyan&#x27; (Sanitation).

In 2017, the Bharti Family pledged 10% of their wealth (approx. Rs 70 billion) towards Philanthropy to set up Satya Bharti University, a world-class University to offer education to deserving youth from economically weaker sections of society

Mittal has been married &quot;for decades&quot; to Nyna Mittal, a philanthropist who focuses on education. The couple has one daughter and two sons, who are twins, born 31 August 1987. The daughter, Eiesha Bharti Pasricha, a &quot;lifestyle investor,&quot; lives in London with her husband, businessman Sharan Pasricha, and their two children. One son, Kavin Bharti Mittal, is an entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of Hike, a New Delhi-headquartered tech and internet startup. The other son, Shravin Bharti Mittal, is the founder and CEO of Unbound, a London-based venture capital and private equity firm, and a director of Bharti Global Ltd, a London-headquartered firm in the Bharti corporate family. He was reportedly instrumental in the successful acquisition of OneWeb. In April 2015, in Delhi, Shavrin married Sakshi Chhabra.

<doc id="1318939" wikidata="Q1327635" url="?curid=1318939" title="Paropamisadae">
<text>Paropamisadae or Parapamisadae () was a satrapy of the Alexandrian Empire in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely coincided with the Achaemenid province of Parupraesanna. It consisted of the districts of Sattagydia (Bannu basin), Gandhara (Kabul, Peshawar, and Taxila), and Oddiyana (Swat Valley). Paruparaesanna is mentioned in the Akkadian language and Elamite language versions of the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great, whereas in the Old Persian version it is called [[Gandāra]]. The entire satrapy,was subsequently ceded by Seleucus I Nicator to Chandragupta Maurya following a treaty.

==Name==
&quot;Paropamisadae&quot; is the Latinized form of the Greek name &quot;Paropamisádai&quot; (), which is in turn derived from Old Persian &quot;Para-uparisaina&quot;, meaning &quot;Beyond the Hindu Kush&quot;, where the Hindu Kush is referred to as &quot;Uparisaina&quot; (&quot;higher than the eagle&quot;).

In the Greek language and Latin, &quot;Paropamisus&quot; (, &quot;Paropamisós&quot;) came to mean the Hindu Kush.
In many Greek and Latin sources, particularly editions of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; where their realm is included on the 9th Map of Asia, the names of the people and region are given as Paropanisadae and Paropanisus. They also appeared less frequently as &quot;Parapamisadae&quot; and &quot;Parapamīsus&quot; (, &quot;Parapámisos&quot;), &quot;Paropamīsii&quot;, etc.
The name was also applied to a nearby river, probably the Obi river. The mountain range Selseleh-ye Safīd Kūh is also called &quot;Paropamisus&quot; or &quot;Paropamisus Mountains&quot;.

==Geography and peoples==

Strabo describes the region as follows:
Thus the region was north of Arachosia, stretching up to the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountains, and bounded in the east by the Indus River. It mainly included the Kabul region, Gandhara and the northern regions such as Swat and Chitral.

The nations who composed the Paropamisadae are recorded as the Cabolitae () in the north near modern Kabul; the Parsii (Πάρσιοι) in the northwest, the Ambautae () in the east and the Par(g)yetae () in the south, who were also found in Arachosia. The major cities of the land were the city of Ortospana () or Carura (Κάρουρα), probably identifiable with Kabul, Gauzaca (Γαύζακα), probably modern Ghazni, Capissa (Καπίσσα), modern-day Kapisa, and Parsia (Παρσία), the capital of the Parsii.

==History==
In the ancient Buddhist texts, the Mahajanapada kingdom of Kamboja compassed the territories of Paropamisus and extended to the southwest of Kashmir as far as Rajauri. The region came under Achaemenid Persian control in the late 6th century BC, either during the reign of Cyrus the Great or Darius I.

In the 320s BC, Alexander the Great conquered the entire Achaemenid Empire, beginning the Hellenistic period. The Greek name Παροπαμισάδαι or Παροπαμισσός was used extensively in Greek literature to describe the conquests of Alexander and those of the kings of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom, from the 3rd to the 1st centuries BC.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the area came under control of the Seleucid Empire, which gave the region to the Mauryan Dynasty of India in 305 BC. After the fall of the Mauryans in 185 BC, the Greco-Bactrians under King Demetrius I annexed the northwestern regions of the former Mauryan Empire, including Paropamisus, and it became part of his Euthydemid Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Eucratidians seized the area soon after the death of Menander I, but lost it to the Yuezhi around 125 BC.

<text>Preston Robert Tisch (April 29, 1926 – November 15, 2005) was an American businessman who was the chairman and—along with his brother Laurence Tisch—was part owner of the Loews Corporation. From 1991 until his death, Tisch owned 50% of the New York Giants football team and shared ownership of the team with Wellington Mara.
==Early life==
Tisch was born in 1926 in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, the son of Sadye (née Brenner) and Al Tisch. His father&#x27;s parents had emigrated from Ukraine and his mother&#x27;s parents from Poland, and were of Jewish descent. His father, a former All-American basketball player at the City University of New York, owned a garment factory as well as two summer camps which his wife helped him run.

Tisch attended DeWitt Clinton High School for a year before transferring to Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. Tisch received a BA degree in economics from the University of Michigan in 1948, and his wife Joan Tisch and his daughter also received degrees at the university. While in college Tisch was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu, a Jewish fraternity.

==Career==
On August 16, 1986, he was appointed Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service, serving until March 1, 1988.

===New York Giants (1991-2005)===
In 1991, Tisch purchased fifty percent of the New York Giants of the National Football League. The team had been owned by the Mara family since the team&#x27;s founding, but the stakes were split at the time between Wellington Mara and his brother Jack&#x27;s family, with Jack&#x27;s son Tim given control of his father&#x27;s share upon his death. Tim was ill at the time, fighting Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, and no longer desired to participate in the team&#x27;s operations; Tisch and Tim&#x27;s family would eventually come to terms on the purchase of their share of the team shortly after the Giants won Super Bowl XXV. During his time as owner, Tisch contributed to the business operations of the team, using his experiences as an executive to manage the team&#x27;s front office. As an executive, Tisch also served on the NFL&#x27;s Finance and Super Bowl Policy committees.

Tisch held the share until he died on November 15, 2005, from brain cancer. Tisch&#x27;s death followed Wellington Mara&#x27;s death by three weeks and that of his brother, Laurence, by exactly two years. His share of the Giants passed to his son Steve, who co-owns the team with Mara&#x27;s son John.

Tisch was posthumously inducted into the New York Giants&#x27; Ring of Honor in 2010.

===Business career===
Tisch began his career in business when he opened a hotel, the Grand Hotel in 1946, with his brother, Larry. After years of losing money the hotel burnt down under suspicious circumstances. The brothers continued to expand their hotel business, building the Americana Hotel in Bal Harbor in 1957, designed to attract convention business, one of the first such hotels in the country. Later on, he successfully led the hospitality and hotel industry to a large expansion between the 1960s and 1970s.

Tisch also served for 19 years as chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, also known as NYC &amp; Company, which spearheaded NYC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Apple&quot; campaign and popularized the New York City nickname. He eventually purchased stock in Loew&#x27;s Inc. in 1958, owning the company beginning in 1959, and creating Loew&#x27;s Corporation as a parent company of Loew&#x27;s Theatres and Loew&#x27;s Hotels in 1970. Bob was named president and Chief Operating Officer of Loews in 1968. In 1968, Loews acquired Lorillard, the 5th largest tobacco company in the United States at the time, which owned the popular brands Kent, Newport and True. Both Bob and his brother retired as co-CEOs of Loews on December 31, 1998. Loews eventually diversified into fields such as insurance and natural gas.

==Philanthropy==

Tisch made substantial donations to his alma maters, leading to these institutions naming buildings and a school after him. Tisch Hall, on the University of Michigan central campus, houses that university&#x27;s history department. New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts and NYU Medical Center&#x27;s Tisch Hospital are named after Laurence A. and Preston Robert Tisch. NYU&#x27;s Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management was founded in 1995 and expanded in 1999 to meet the needs of a growing student population. In 1997, the Central Park Zoo opened the Tisch Children&#x27;s Zoo.

Given two months to live by his New York doctors, Tisch lived for 14 more months under care at Duke University Medical Center. In recognition of their efforts, the Tisch family donated $10 million to the Duke Brain Tumor Center which was renamed the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center in October 2005.

The Tisch Building in New York City, which is the headquarters of the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC), is named for him and his wife, who is on the GMHC Board of Directors, after they donated $3.5 million for it in March 1997. There is additionally a Preston R. Tisch Professorship in Judaic Studies and the Preston Robert Tisch Tennis Building at the University of Michigan. Tisch was also a founding member of the Association for a Better New York, which took on the task of tackling city problems that had previously fallen to the city&#x27;s agencies. He additionally helped to found Citymeals on Wheels and personally served meals to the city&#x27;s elderly. There is a Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92Y in New York, and Tisch Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts. Tisch founded the charity Take the Field, which raised $135 million in public and private funds to repair 43 athletic fields in New York City.

==Awards and honors==
*1982 – Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement
*1995 – Frank W. Berkman Tourism Achievement Award
*2000 – Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor, Conrad N. Hilton College, Hilton University of Houston

<text>Kloss&#x27;s gibbon (Hylobates klossii), also known as the Mentawai gibbon, the bilou or dwarf siamang, is an endangered primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae. It is identifiable in that it is all black, resembling the siamang with its black fur, but is considerably smaller and lacks the siamang&#x27;s distinctive throat pouch. Kloss&#x27;s gibbon reaches a size 17 to 25 inches (44 to 63 cm) and weigh at most 13 pounds (6 kg). As is the case for all gibbons, they have long arms and no tail. Males and females are difficult to distinguish.

== Habitat ==
Kloss&#x27;s gibbon exclusively lives on the Mentawai Islands that lie to the west of Sumatra. The Mentawai Islands consist four main islands that are part of an island archipelago. These islands are hearths of biodiversity, and are the homes of many endemic species. It is a diurnal inhabitant of the rain forest that hangs in the trees from its long arms and rarely comes to the ground. Because Kloss&#x27;s gibbon rarely comes out of the canopy, these gibbons use tree limbs to cross obstacles like bodies of water. Like all species of gibbons it lives together in pairs that stake out a territory from approximately 49 to 74 acres (20 to 30 hectares) of size. This area is defended vehemently against other gibbons. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, occasionally also eating different plant parts, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates.

== Communication ==
Kloss&#x27;s gibbon are unique gibbons because the two sexes do not vocalize songs in unison. Male Kloss&#x27;s gibbon sing before the sun rises and female Kloss&#x27;s gibbon vocalize songs once the sun has risen. Female Kloss&#x27;s gibbon calls are unique and have slight variations in the different stages of the call. The calls emitted by the females could offer other members of the species information about their position in the canopy.

== Reproduction ==
The reproductive cycle of Kloss&#x27;s gibbon is similar to that of other gibbons. Every two to three years the female may give birth to a single young (with a gestation period of seven months). The young is weaned in the middle of its second year, and is fully mature in about seven years. Their life expectancy is about 25 years in the wild, and up to 40 years in captivity. Kloss&#x27;s gibbons are monogamous, and male Kloss&#x27;s gibbons use territory to attract and court possible mates. Territories are often contested and Kloss&#x27;s gibbons defend their territories with aggression and threats. During courtship, males and females defend territory together, and mating only occurs after the females deems the male capable of defending a suitable territory.

== Diet ==
Kloss&#x27;s gibbon are picky eaters, and never consume over-ripened fruit. Kloss&#x27;s gibbons diet consists of fruit, leaves, shoots, and insects. Kloss&#x27;s gibbons favorite fruit is figs, but these gibbons do not spend a lot of time eating figs because figs are scarce on the Mentawai Islands.

== Behavior ==
When Kloss&#x27;s gibbons are observed by human researchers, they adapt and become less afraid, a process called habituation. Kloss&#x27;s gibbons can become habituated to humans and will not flee when they are observed. Unhabituated Kloss&#x27;s gibbons sometimes exhibit a warning behavior in which they act as a lure toward people. One male gibbon will produce warning calls and attract attention to himself while other members of his group make their escape. Kloss&#x27;s gibbons behavior help it stay cryptic, possibly to help them avoid hunting pressure. Female Kloss&#x27;s gibbons sing less frequently than males, and males only sing in the predawn when visibility isn&#x27;t optimal for hunting. Kloss&#x27;s gibbons also exhibit less aggregate behavior like grooming and playing, possibly to reduce their visibility and stay hidden from hunters.

== Conservation ==
Kloss&#x27;s gibbon is in jeopardy of going extinct. Kloss&#x27;s gibbon is classified as endangered by the IUCN (2021). Recent estimates conclude that there are around 20,000 to 25,000 Kloss&#x27;s gibbons alive in the wild, and its numbers are declining. Over the last two and a half decades, the population size of Kloss&#x27;s gibbon has fallen by 50%. There are several threats that pose significant risk to Kloss&#x27;s gibbon. Kloss&#x27;s gibbon has no natural predators, and humans are the main threat to the existence of this primate. Native peoples of the Mentawai Islands kill Kloss&#x27;s gibbon and other endemic primates for subsistence, and also participate in poaching activities. Globalization and industrialization in the Mentawai Islands are contributing toward the degradation of high quality habitat needed by Kloss&#x27;s gibbon. Road development and the adoption of air rifles are allowing natives to kill Kloss&#x27;s gibbon easier and at higher rates. Kloss&#x27;s gibbon spends the majority of its time in the tree canopy, and as a result, this species requires undisturbed, old-growth forest habitats to sustain itself. Kloss&#x27;s gibbon is at risk due to habitat loss, as its homeland islands are suffering from deforestation. Conservationists focused on improving Kloss&#x27;s gibbons endangered status need to protect and preserve the high quality habitat needed by these gibbons. Fragments of habitat need to be connected to allow movement without risk of exposure in highly modified areas. Local government has been cooperating with global organizations such as UNESCO to raise awareness as well as increase the amount of protected land in the Mentawai Islands.

<text>Marián Čalfa (born 7 May 1946, in Trebišov) is a Slovak former politician, who served as prime minister of Czechoslovakia during and after the Velvet Revolution in 1989, as well as de facto acting President for 19 days. He was a key figure in the smooth transfer of power from Communist rule to democracy.

==Career==
From 1985, Čalfa worked as the head of a legislative department of the Czechoslovak federal government. In April 1988, he became the chairman of the legislative committee. On 10 December 1989, during the Velvet Revolution, he was appointed prime minister in place of discredited Ladislav Adamec. Although Čalfa was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), this government had a non-Communist majority. He thus headed the first cabinet in 41 years that was not dominated by the KSČ. When President Gustáv Husák resigned shortly after swearing in the government, Čalfa also took on most presidential duties until the election of Václav Havel on 29 December.

On 18 January 1990, Čalfa left the KSČ to join Public Against Violence (VPN), the Slovak counterpart of Havel&#x27;s Civic Forum, thus becoming the first prime minister since before World War II who was not a Communist or a fellow traveler. The first postwar prime minister, Social Democrat Zdeněk Fierlinger, had been openly pro-Communist, and later led his party into a merger with the Communists. Čalfa helped lead Havel&#x27;s movement to a sweeping victory in the 1990 elections. When VPN dissolved in April 1991, he followed most of the party into the Civic Democratic Union (ODU-VPN), of which he became a leading member.

Both cabinets headed by Čalfa succeeded in introducing significant political and economic reforms, facilitating the transition from Communist rule to a multi-party system and a market-oriented economy. Čalfa received strong support from other political figures, including both President Václav Havel and Finance Minister Václav Klaus.

Čalfa resigned from the Federal Government after the defeat of the Public Against Violence in the elections of 1992. He was succeeded by caretaker Jan Stráský, whose major task was to oversee the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia. In that year, Čalfa took up Czech citizenship and started working as a lawyer in Prague, heading the law firm Čalfa, Bartošík a Partneři.

During his tenure as prime minister, Čalfa was occasionally a target of criticism for his Communist past. Some cited this as proof that the Velvet Revolution was unfinished or had even been &quot;stolen&quot; by people belonging to the past &quot;nomenklatura&quot;. Presently, historians consider him a &quot;power behind the throne,&quot; who greatly contributed to the smoothness and speed of the Velvet Revolution and the election of Václav Havel as president. He used his negotiation skills in critical moments against his fellow Communist Party members and talked them into compromises that were sometimes more radical than the representatives of the Civic Forum had expected.

<doc id="1318955" wikidata="Q15214972" url="?curid=1318955" title="Leísmo">
<text>Leísmo (&quot;using &quot;le&quot;&quot;) is a dialectal variation in the Spanish language that occurs largely in Spain. It involves using the indirect object pronouns &quot;le&quot; and &quot;les&quot; in place of the (generally standard) direct object pronouns &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, and &quot;las&quot;, especially when the direct object refers to a male person or people.

&quot;Leísmo&quot; with animate objects is both common and prescriptively accepted in many dialects spoken in Spain, but uncommon in most others. It thus typically correlates with the use of the preposition &quot;a&quot; for animate direct objects (for this &quot;personal a&quot;, see Spanish prepositions). &quot;Leísmo&quot; is always rejected in linguistic prescription when the direct object to which it refers is not an animate object. For example:
:&quot;&quot; (&quot;I see the boy&quot;) → &quot;Lo veo&quot; (standard Spanish, with &quot;lo&quot;)
:&quot;&quot; (&quot;I see the boy&quot;) → &quot;Le veo&quot; (&quot;leísmo&quot;, common in Spain; other regions prefer &quot;lo veo&quot;)
:&quot;&quot; (&quot;I see the tree&quot;) → &quot;Le veo&quot; (not accepted in linguistic prescription — the tree is not a person)

&quot;Le&quot; and &quot;les&quot; are properly speaking the epicene indirect object pronouns, used for both masculine and feminine antecedents, whether animate or inanimate. In certain dialects the reverse occurs and the indirect object pronouns are replaced by &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, or &quot;las&quot; (&quot;loísmo&quot; and &quot;laísmo&quot;), but this usage is not accepted by the &quot;Real Academia Española&quot; (Royal Spanish Academy):

:&quot;Le voy a dar un regalo (a él/ella)&quot; (&quot;I am going to give him/her a present&quot;, standard) → &quot;Lo voy a dar un regalo&quot;
:&quot;Dile que la quiero&quot; (&quot;Tell her I love her&quot;, standard) → &quot;Dila que la quiero&quot;

==Theoretical basis==
There are various diachronic and synchronic reasons for the use of &quot;le/les&quot; for direct objects. To understand why there is vacillation and hesitation in usage, it is helpful to understand these often-conflicting linguistic forces.

;a) Influence of other pronouns and determiners
There is a strong tendency in Spanish, inherited from Latin, for pronouns and determiners to have a set of three different endings for the three genders. These are: &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o&quot; for masculine pronouns, &quot;-a&quot; for feminine pronouns and &quot;-o&quot; for neuter pronouns.

Thus, &quot;éste, ésta, esto&quot;; &quot;ése, ésa, eso&quot;; &quot;aquél, aquélla, aquello&quot;; &quot;el, la, lo&quot;; &quot;él, ella, ello&quot;.

Hence some speakers say &quot;le vi&quot; (&quot;I saw him&quot;) for any masculine person, &quot;la vi&quot; (&quot;I saw her/it&quot;) for any feminine noun, and &quot;lo vi&quot; (&quot;I saw it&quot;) to refer to an inanimate masculine noun (e.g. Vi al piso → &quot;Lo vi)&quot;, or a clause (Viste lo que pasó anoche → &quot;Lo viste)&quot;. This gives us a set like the above: &quot;le, la, lo&quot;.

Furthermore, &quot;le&quot; also follows the pattern of &quot;me&quot; (&quot;me&quot;) and &quot;te&quot; (&quot;you&quot;) which operate as both direct and indirect objects.

*&quot;Me ven&quot; (&quot;They see me&quot;)
*&quot;Te ven&quot; (&quot;They see you&quot;)
*&quot;Le ven&quot; (&quot;They see him/her&quot; - leísmo)

;b) Indirectness for humans — general
There is a tendency, discussed at Spanish prepositions, to treat as indirect objects those direct objects which happen to refer to people. Hence some speakers say &quot;le/les vi&quot; &quot;I saw him/her/them&quot; when referring to people and &quot;lo/la/los/las vi&quot; &quot;I saw it/them&quot; when referring to things. This is known as &quot;leísmo de persona&quot; and is permitted by the Real Academia Española (RAE) only when used in the masculine singular (i.e. &quot;le&quot; to mean &quot;him&quot;).

;b1) Indirectness for humans — respect for the interlocutor
The general tendency to use indirect objects for people also occurs when the speaker wishes to convey respect. The second person formal &quot;usted&quot; is conjugated the same as the third person, hence some speakers use &quot;lo/la/los/las vi&quot; &quot;I saw him/her/it/them&quot; when speaking about a third party or an object, but &quot;le/les vi&quot; &quot;I saw you&quot; when the pronoun is intended to represent &quot;usted/ustedes&quot;. This is known as &quot;leísmo de cortesía&quot; and is permitted by the RAE.

;b2) Indirectness for humans — contrast with inanimate things
The general tendency to use indirect objects for people is intensified when the &quot;subject&quot; of the sentence is not human, thus creating a contrast in the mind of the speaker between the human and the thing. Hence some speakers say &quot;la halagó&quot; &quot;he flattered her&quot; when the subject is &quot;he&quot; referring to a person, but &quot;le halagó&quot; &quot;it flattered her&quot; when the subject is &quot;it&quot;, a thing.

;b3) Indirectness for humans — humanity otherwise emphasised
The general tendency to use indirect objects for people is intensified when the humanity of the person who is the object of the sentence is emphasised by the way the verb is used. Hence some speakers opt for a subtle distinction between &quot;lo llevamos al hospital&quot; &quot;we took/carried him to the hospital&quot; when the patient is unconscious and &quot;le llevamos al hospital&quot; &quot;we took/led him to the hospital&quot; when the patient is able to walk.

;b4) Indirectness for humans — with impersonal &quot;se&quot;
The general tendency to use indirect objects for people is intensified when the impersonal &quot;se&quot; is used instead of a real subject. This is to avoid the misinterpretation of the &quot;se&quot; as being an indirect object pronoun. Hence some speakers say &quot;se le lee mucho&quot; &quot;people read him/her a lot&quot; if &quot;se&quot; means &quot;people&quot; and &quot;le&quot; means &quot;him/her&quot;, and reserve &quot;se lo/la lee mucho&quot; &quot;he/she reads it a lot for him/her&quot; for sentences in which the &quot;se&quot; is not impersonal.

==Usage in practice==
All of the theoretical reasons for using &quot;le/les&quot; detailed above actually influence the way Spanish speakers use these pronouns, and this has been demonstrated by various surveys and investigations. Not all usage of direct-object &quot;le/les&quot; is dialectal, however. In some cases, it is universal across the educated Spanish-speaking world.

Let us first look at dialectal extremes. There is &quot;leísmo&quot; (covered under point a above) motivated by the tendency towards masculine &quot;e&quot; in uneducated Madrid speech. This actually used to be quite standard, and the &quot;Real Academia&quot; only stopped endorsing it in the 1850s. We therefore find in old texts:
Such speakers would say &quot;le afirman&quot; in reference to a word like &quot;el hecho&quot;, &quot;la afirman&quot; in reference to a word like &quot;la verdad&quot;, and &quot;lo afirman&quot; only in reference to a general neuter &quot;it&quot;.

The second extreme &quot;leísmo&quot; is the one motivated by the second point mentioned: the tendency to use indirect objects for people. This is noticeable in Northwestern Spain, especially Navarre and the Basque Country, where regional speech uses &quot;le vi&quot; for &quot;I saw him/her&quot; and &quot;lo/la vi&quot; for &quot;I saw it&quot;. The same phenomenon is sporadically heard elsewhere, e.g. in Valencia and Paraguay.

Now let us look at less extremely dialectal cases. For the majority of educated speakers in Spain and parts of Latin America, neither of the two tendencies (a or b) is enough on its own to justify the use of &quot;le/les&quot;; but &quot;together&quot; they are. Thus, speakers who would reject sentences like &quot;le vi&quot; for &quot;I saw it&quot; and &quot;le vi&quot; for &quot;I saw her&quot; would nevertheless accept and use &quot;le vi&quot; for &quot;I saw him&quot;. Indeed, this use of &quot;le&quot; to mean &quot;him&quot; is so common in an area of central Spain that some would call the use of &quot;lo vi&quot; to mean &quot;I saw him&quot; an example of &quot;loísmo/laísmo&quot;, i.e. the dialectalism whereby &quot;lo&quot; is overused. The Real Academia&#x27;s current line is that &quot;le&quot; for &quot;him&quot; is officially &quot;tolerated&quot;.

A case on which the Academy is silent is the tendency described in point b1. It is perfectly common in educated speech in many parts of the world to distinguish between &quot;no quería molestarlo&quot; &quot;I did not mean to bother him&quot; and &quot;no quería molestarle&quot; &quot;I did not mean to bother you&quot;. Those Spaniards who would not just say &quot;le&quot; anyway for the reasons explained in the last paragraph are likely to use &quot;le&quot; in this case. Butt &amp; Benjamin (1994) says that their Argentine informants made this distinction, whereas their &quot;loísta&quot; Colombian informants preferred &quot;molestarlo&quot; always.

The Academy is also silent on the tendency described in b2; however, it is universal across the Spanish-speaking world. In a questionnaire given to 28 Spaniards in the Madrid region, 90% preferred &quot;la halagó&quot; for &quot;he flattered her&quot; and 87% preferred &quot;le halagó&quot; for &quot;it flattered her&quot;. García (1975) reports a similar but less extreme tendency in Buenos Aires: only 14% of García&#x27;s sample said &quot;él le convenció&quot; for &quot;he convinced him&quot; (the rest said &quot;él lo convenció&quot;). With an inanimate subject, a slight majority (54%) said &quot;este color no le convence&quot;.

García reports Buenos Aires natives differentiating between &quot;lo llevaron al hospital&quot; and &quot;le llevaron al hospital&quot; depending on how active the patient is, although anecdotal evidence suggests that Argentines are more &quot;loísta&quot; than this, and would prefer &quot;lo&quot; in both cases.

Point b3 is also backed up by the fact that many Latin Americans distinguish between &quot;le quiero&quot; &quot;I love him&quot; and &quot;lo quiero&quot; &quot;I want him&quot; (or indeed &quot;I want it&quot;).

<text>Charles Clarence Butt (born February 3, 1938) is an American heir and billionaire. He inherited his family&#x27;s San Antonio–based H-E-B supermarket chain in 1971. The privately held company has more than 400 stores and $38.9 billion in sales, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

==Early life==
Charles Clarence Butt was born on February 3, 1938, the son of Howard Edward Butt Sr. and Mary Elizabeth Holdsworth, and the grandson of Florence Butt, who founded H-E-B in 1905.

Butt graduated from University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School with a bachelor&#x27;s degree, where he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. He earned an MBA from Harvard Business School.

==Career==
Butt became chairman, CEO, and president of the H-E-B Grocery Company in 1971.

In late 2019, Butt and his family had a net worth of over US$10 billion, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2013, AdvisoryCloud ranked Butt as the No. 5 CEO on its Top Chief Executive List.

In November 2001, the Mexican government awarded Butt the Aguila Azteca medal for his philanthropic involvement and business dealings in Mexico.

==Philanthropy==
Butt pledged $50 million to the Raising Texas Teachers scholarship fund to support the training of Texas public school teachers.

In January 2017, he pledged $100 million to Texas public education and created The Holdsworth Center, named after his mother Mary Elizabeth Butt (née Holdsworth).

In September 2017, Butt donated $5 million to J. J. Watt&#x27;s Houston Hurricane Harvey relief fund.

As of May 2018, Butt pledges to The Giving Pledge and writes in his release that he intends to help children and teachers.
In March 2024, Butt donated $500,000 to the State of Texas Agricultural Relief (STAR) Fund to aid Texas farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural businesses affected by the wildfires there.

==Personal life==
Butt is single. Butt and his family were excluded from the annual Forbes list of the world&#x27;s top billionaires beginning in 2016. The magazine changed its methodology to exclude individuals from families that share their fortunes.

Butt frequently donates to political campaigns, primarily those of Republicans but has donated to various Democratic campaigns as well.

<text>Karel Urbánek (born 22 March 1941 in Bojkovice, Moravia) is a retired Czech politician, and the last Communist leader of Czechoslovakia.

==Career==
A former Bojkovice railway station manager, he replaced Miloš Jakeš as Secretary General of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia after a swift election on 24 November 1989 in the wake of the Velvet Revolution. Four days later, he gave his approval to a constitutional amendment which stripped the Communist Party of its monopoly of power, which proved to be the only major decision of his tenure. However, Communist rule had effectively ended with Jakeš&#x27; resignation. He remained as party leader until 20 December 1989, when he was succeeded by Ladislav Adamec.

His mother, Ann Rork, was his father&#x27;s fourth wife. When his father died in 1976, Gordon assumed control of Getty&#x27;s US$ 2 billion trust. His net worth was $2.1 billion in September 2020, making him number 391 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 list of the wealthiest Americans.

==Early life==
Getty was raised in San Francisco, California, where he attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory and the University of San Francisco. He would also earn a B.A. in music from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He studied singing with Verna Osborne.

==Career==
He joined the oil business to please his father; however, he eventually sold the family&#x27;s Getty Oil to Texaco in 1986 for US$10 billion. In 1983, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked him the richest person in America with a net worth of a little over $2 billion. His net worth was cited as $2.1 billion in 2020, making him the 391st richest person in the United States.

In 2002, Getty founded ReFlow, a company which temporarily purchases shares in mutual funds to save funds taxes and commissions.

===Classical music===
Among several professions, Getty is a classical music composer whose compositions include the opera &quot;Plump Jack&quot;, &quot;Joan and the Bells&quot;, piano pieces, and a collection of choral works. His one-act opera &quot;Usher House&quot; was performed by the San Francisco Opera in 2015. Aspiring to become an opera singer, Getty studied in the mid-1970s with Louise Caselotti, a mezzo-soprano who had been Maria Callas&#x27; voice teacher (1946–47). He and his wife have supported the fine arts, especially underwriting productions of the San Francisco Opera and the Russian National Orchestra.

Getty&#x27;s opera &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; was premiered on May 9, 2015, at the Leipzig Opera.

==Personal life==
On Christmas Day, 1964, he married Ann Gilbert (1941–2020) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gordon and Ann Getty lived in a yellow Italianate mansion in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Over the years, Getty and Ann, a publisher and a decorator, expanded their living space, buying the house next door (to make room for his work at the piano) and then the house next door to that. They hosted charity events, opera stars, and fundraisers for politicians, including Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom. Gavin Newsom&#x27;s father, William Newsom, one of Gordon&#x27;s friends since high school, managed the family trust for years.

Gordon and Ann Getty had four children: Gordon Peter Getty, Jr (born 1965); William Paul Getty (born 1970); Andrew Rork Getty (1967 - 2015); John Gilbert Getty (1968 - 2020).

Getty&#x27;s assets are managed by Vallejo Investments. Vallejo Investments is what&#x27;s known as a &quot;family office,&quot; an in-house financial team of specialized attorneys, accountants, and money managers.

Getty has a second family based in Los Angeles, including three daughters,  with his former longtime companion Cynthia Beck.

His donations to University of San Francisco helped build the Koret Health &amp; Recreation Center, John Lo Schiavo, S.J. Center for Science &amp; Innovation, and helped establish the J. Paul Getty Honors College Fund.

==In popular culture==
Gordon Getty&#x27;s life as a composer was chronicled in Peter Rosen&#x27;s documentary &quot;Gordon Getty: There Will be Music,&quot; which premiered on February 5, 2016, at Cinema Village in New York City. It has been broadcast on PBS in the U.S. and Europe on ARTE, as well as film festivals and programs across the country.

He is chairman of Orkla, where he is a major shareholder, and holds large stakes in Steen &amp; Strøm, Jernia and Komplett through his family company Canica. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Hagen is worth US$2.1 billion, making him the sixth richest person in Norway.

==Biography==
Hagen is educated at &quot;Kjøpmannsinsituttet&quot; (now part of the BI Norwegian Business School). He founded the RIMI discount store chain along with his father in the 1970s, and retained ownership until the 2000s, when he sold to Swedish ICA and Ahold. Most of the money was ploughed into Orkla. Hagen reportedly owns one of the biggest sailboats in Europe and used to own his own island in the Caribbean.

He provided financial support to the Liberal Party in the 2005 Norwegian election and to the Liberal Party, Christian Democratic Party, Conservative Party and Progress Party in 2006.

== Private life ==
Stein Erik Hagen has three children from his first marriage, and a son from a later relationship. In 2004 he married Mille-Marie Treschow, the couple announced in 2012 that they were separating.

In October 2015, Hagen came out on the Norwegian-Swedish talk show &quot;Skavlan&quot;. Later the same day he added that he was bisexual, and that his ex-wives and family have known about his sexuality for many years.

<doc id="1318978" wikidata="Q3637872" url="?curid=1318978" title="Belsen Was a Gas">
<text>&quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot; is a song by the English punk rock band the Sex Pistols, about one of the Nazi concentration camps in Nazi Germany liberated by British troops in 1945, Bergen-Belsen.

==Composition==
According to the ASCAP, credited songwriters are Sid Vicious, Paul Cook, Steve Jones, and John Lydon. Others generally accept Vicious wrote it while in his earlier band the Flowers of Romance. Its title is a pun on the poison gases used in many Nazi concentration camps, referencing a &quot;&quot; as slang for a fun time. In fact, there were no gas chambers at Bergen-Belsen, as it was not one of the extermination camps; most of the around 37,000 deaths there were due to typhus or starvation.

The song&#x27;s darkly humorous lyrics were intended to irritate the generation the group believed were responsible for many of the political and social problems in Britain at that time. Later, Lydon said that he felt that this song crossed the line into gratuitous bad taste. In an interview conducted for &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 1996 he stated &quot;[the song] was a very nasty, silly little thing... that should&#x27;ve ended up on the cutting room floor.&quot;

==Release history==
&quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot; appears in two versions on &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; album, first a live version from the Sex Pistols&#x27; last concert (San Francisco, 14 January 1978), then in an altered studio version with Ronnie Biggs on vocals. Biggs insisted on adding an additional verse; he later said because he had read the published diary of Anne Frank. The second verse describes some of the treatment Jews received:

The version with Biggs is also altered in its musical composition. In the original version done with Rotten, the main theme is a power chord riff that goes D, C, D, E♭ (plays with &quot;Belsen was a gas, I heard the other day&quot;). When rerecorded for the Biggs version, that theme is drastically altered to D, C, B♭, C, a much more conventional progression. Biggs did not receive writing credit for the revised lyrics. The Biggs version was originally slated to be a single, but after an airplay and record shop ban on the earlier Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle single, &quot;No One Is Innocent&quot; (due to Biggs being the lead vocalist), this idea was dropped. The Biggs remake also ends with a saxophone solo, the first on a Pistols record.

The live version from San Francisco ends with Johnny Rotten haranguing the listener to &quot;Be a man / Kill a man / Be someone / Kill someone / Be a man / Kill yourself!&quot; as the music abruptly stops. Of this version of the song, Lester Bangs wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the most frightening things I&#x27;ve ever heard. You wonder exactly what you might be affirming by listening to this over and over again. On one level Johnny Rotten/Lydon is an insect buzzing atop the massed ruins of a civilization leveled by itself, which I suppose justifies him right there, on another level he&#x27;s just another trafficker in cheap nihilism with all that it includes—cheap racism, sexism, etc. I&#x27;m still not comfortable with &#x27;Bodies.&#x27; But then I never was, which may be the point. But then I wonder if he is. After which I cease to wonder at anything beyond the power of this music.&quot;

On most versions of the album, the live version is listed in grammatically-incorrect German, using Gothic script, as &quot;Einmal Belsen war vortrefflich&quot; (roughly, &quot;Once Belsen was excellent&quot;) and Biggs&#x27; version is &quot;Einmal Belsen war wirklich vortrefflich&quot; (roughly, &quot;Once Belsen was really excellent&quot;). The first UK sleeve gave the titles as &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot; and &quot;Belsen Vos a Gassa&quot;.

The &quot;Sex Pistols&quot; (2002) box set includes another live version of &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot; on disc 3. This version was recorded on January 10, 1978 at the Longhorn Ballroom, Dallas, Texas, a concert that was filmed and has been released on home video. The Longhorn version of the song is notable for Lydon sneering &quot;Join the army!&quot; in the song&#x27;s closing tirade.

&quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot; was played by The Sex Pistols at the Crystal Palace Silver Jubilee show in 2002 when they played all of their catalogue in one night. When The Sex Pistols reformed for a reunion tour of the U.S. in 2003, after the start of the Iraq War, they performed an adapted version of the song, called &quot;Baghdad Was a Blast&quot;, as an attack on President George W. Bush&#x27;s policies in the region. At the first of the band&#x27;s Brixton Academy shows in November 2007, the song was performed in a further adapted version, this time as &quot;Brixton Was a Blast&quot;.

John Lydon&#x27;s successor band, Public Image Ltd, performed the song in concert from 1978 to 1979 in a set that mostly featured work from the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Public Image: First Issue&quot; (1978). At the Kings Hall in Manchester in 1979, Lydon introduced the song by saying, &quot;The next one is sarcasm, in case you get it wrong.&quot; On a recording of the December 1978 Rainbow Theatre concert he responds to crowd complaints by saying &quot;if you make as much fuss about the next fucking bus you&#x27;ve got to wait for, you might be better off, know what I mean?&quot;

Vicious performed and released a version on his solo album, &quot;Sid Sings&quot;, introduced on the album as &quot;[written] by Sid Vicious!&quot;.

Cover versions of the song have been performed and recorded live and in studio by bands including British punk group the Exploited who played theirs as early as 1983. Chaos UK also covered the song. The song was covered in 1996 by the neo-Nazi skinhead band No Remorse.

==Demo version==
A long-lost demo version of the song was rediscovered during a move from Virgin Records to Universal Music Catalogue in January 2012. It was included in the &quot;Never Mind The Bollocks, Here&#x27;s The Sex Pistols&quot; box set and released that 24 September. It includes very faint reverberating vocals. A different version, &quot;Belsen Was a Gas Demo 2&quot;, was released in a box on 19 April 2014.

In the same year, he gave the Yale School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science&#x27;s largest gift ever of $50 million.

Malone has also given $60 million to Hopkins School in New Haven to fund the construction of two new buildings, Malone Science Center, named for his father, as well as Heath Commons, named after his favorite Hopkins teacher.

In 2014, Malone and his wife donated $42.5 million to Colorado State University to help create their Institute for Biologic Translational Therapies, which aims to develop stem cell and other treatments for animals and people. Of the donation, $32.5 million will pay for half the construction costs and $10 million will go to operational expenses.

In 2021, the Malones donated $25 million to Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine, for the hospital’s $534 million capital improvement project. Maine Medical Center will name a new tower for cardiac and vascular services the Malone Family Tower; Leslie Malone recently received cardiac care at the hospital.

<doc id="1319010" wikidata="Q475379" url="?curid=1319010" title="Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta">
<text>Istiqlal Mosque (; ) in Jakarta, Indonesia is the largest mosque in Southeast Asia and the ninth largest mosque in the world in terms of worshipper capacity. Built to commemorate Indonesian independence, this national mosque of Indonesia was named &quot;Istiqlal&quot;, an Arabic word for &quot;independence&quot;. The mosque was opened to the public on 22 February 1978. Within Jakarta, the mosque is positioned next to Merdeka Square, the Jakarta Cathedral (Catholic), and also of the Immanuel Church (Reformed).

==History==

The mosque was formerly the location of Wilhelmina Park and a 19th-century fortification called Citadel.

===Design and competition===

After the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945, the idea of constructing a grand Indonesian national mosque was raised by Wahid Hasyim, Indonesia&#x27;s first minister for religious affairs, and Anwar Cokroaminoto, later appointed as the chairman of the Masjid Istiqlal Foundation. The committee for the construction of the Istiqlal Mosque, led by Cokroaminoto, was founded in 1953. He proposed a national mosque to Indonesian President Sukarno, who welcomed the idea and later helped to supervise the mosque&#x27;s construction. In 1954, the committee appointed Sukarno as technical chief supervisor. The architect of the Istiqlal Mosque was Friedrich Silaban, the winner of a design competition. He is the son of a Lutheran pastor from the Batak Protestant Christian Church.

Several locations were proposed; Mohammad Hatta, Indonesian vice president, suggested that the mosque should be built near residential areas on Thamrin avenue, on a plot where Hotel Indonesia stands today. However, Sukarno insisted that a national mosque should be located near the most important square of the nation, near the Merdeka Palace. This is in accordance with the Javanese tradition that the &quot;kraton&quot; (king&#x27;s palace) and &quot;masjid agung&quot; (grand mosque) should be located around the &quot;alun-alun&quot; (main Javanese city square), which means it must be near Merdeka Square. Sukarno also insisted that the national mosque should be built near Jakarta Cathedral and Immanuel Church, to symbolize religious harmony and tolerance as promoted in Pancasila. It was later decided that the national mosque was going to be built in Taman Widjaja Kusuma (formerly Wilhelmina park), in front of the Jakarta Cathedral. To make way for the mosque, the Citadel Prins Frederick, built in 1837, was demolished.

===Construction===
The foundation stone was laid by Sukarno on 24 August 1961; the construction took 17 years. President Suharto inaugurated it as the national mosque on 22 February 1978. , it is the largest mosque in the region of Southeast Asia, with a capacity of over 120,000.

===Contemporary events===

On Friday night, 14 April 1978, a bomb made of plastic explosive was set off near the mimbar in Istiqlal Mosque. There were no casualties reported. More than 20 years later, on 19 April 1999, a second bomb attack took place in the basement of the mosque, breaking the glass of the office rooms.

Between May 2019 to July 2020 the mosque underwent major renovation at a cost of US$35 million. Works included: polishing and cleaning the marble exterior and stainless steel geometric ornamentation, a new mihrab and mimbar, upgrading electrical and plumbing systems, new lighting system using LED lamps, renovation of VIP rooms, new gates and improvements of garden, park and plaza, new kiosk for vendors, and a two storied basement parking space.

A tunnel connecting Istiqlal Mosque and St. Mary of the Assumption Cathedral has been constructed by the Indonesian authorities. This tunnel, known as the &quot;Terowongan Silaturahmi&quot; (Tunnel of Friendship), was expected to be finished in April 2020 before Ramadan 2020.

In September 2024 Pope Francis, on a visit to Indonesia, stated that the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta is concrete proof of the presence of religious moderation in Indonesia.
And at the same time signed an Istiqlal Declaration carried out by Pope Francis, head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State and Nasaruddin Umar, the Grand Imam of the Istiqlal Mosque who was accompanied by interfaith figures in Indonesia.

==Structure==

The mosque has seven entrances, and all seven gates are named after &quot;Al-Asmaul-Husna&quot;, the names of God in Islam. The number seven represents the Seven Heavens in Islamic cosmology. The wudu (ablution) fountains are on the ground floor, while the main prayer hall and main courtyard are on the first floor. The building consists of two connected rectangular structures: the main structure and the smaller secondary structure. The smaller one serves as a main gate as well as stairs and prayer spaces.

===Entrance gates===
There are seven entrance gates to the Istiqlal Mosque. Each door is named after one of the 99 Names of Allah. Below are lists of entrance gates into the complex of Istiqlal Mosque:

*Main gates
**Al Fattah/الفتاح (&quot;The Opener&quot;): Located opposite of the Jakarta Cathedral. This is the main entrance for visitors, which also leads to the main parking area. 
**Ar Rozzaq/ٱلْرَّزَّاقُ (&quot;The Provider&quot;): Located at Jalan Perwira. The door leads to the main parking area. 
**As Salam/ٱلْسَّلَامُ (&quot;The Peace&quot;): Entrance for important guests e.g. clerics or ambassadors. The entrance leads to the front rows near the imam.
*Other gates
**Al Quddus/ٱلْقُدُّوسُ (&quot;The Holy&quot;): Located on the northeast of the mosque complex.
**Al Malik/الملك (&quot;The King&quot;): Located on the west of the mosque complex. Used for very important guests e.g. the president of Indonesia or other important guests. 
**Al Ghaffar/ٱلْغَفَّارُ (&quot;The Forgiving&quot;): Located on the south end of the courtyard hall building, just below the minaret of Istiqlal Mosque. This door is the closest to the southeast gate as well as the furthest from the mosque mihrab.
**Ar Rahman/ٱلْرَّحْمَان (&quot;The Compassion&quot;): Located on the southwest corner of the mosque&#x27;s hall building, near the entrance gate of Al Malik.

===Dome===

The rectangular main prayer hall building is covered by a 45-m diameter central spherical dome; the number &quot;45&quot; symbolizes the 1945 Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. The main dome is adorned with a stainless steel ornamental pinnacle in the form of a crescent and star, the symbol of Islam. The smaller secondary dome is also adorned with a stainless steel pinnacle with the name of Allah (God) in Islamic calligraphy.

The dome is supported by twelve round columns, and the prayer hall is surrounded by rectangular piers carrying four levels of balconies. Twelve columns represent the (mostly accepted) birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 12th Rabi&#x27; al-awwal.

===Interior===

The main floor and the four levels of balconies make five floors in all; the number &quot;5&quot; represents the Five Pillars of Islam, within symbolizes the five daily prayers, and also of the Pancasila Staircases at the corners of the building give access to all floors. The main hall is reached through an entrance covered by a dome 8 meters in diameter; the number 8 symbolizes August, the month of Indonesian Independence. The interior design is minimalist, simple and clean-cut, with a minimum of stainless steel geometric ornaments. The 12 columns are covered with stainless steel. On the main wall on qibla there is a mihrab and minbar in the center. On the main wall, there is a large metalwork in Arabic calligraphy, spelling the name of Allah on the right side and Muhammad on the left side, and also calligraphy of Surah Thaha 14th verse in the center. The metalworks, stainless steel covers and ornaments were imported from Germany. Originally, as in the National Monument nearby, the white marbles were planned to be imported from Italy. However to cut costs and support the local marble industry, it was later decided that the marbles would be from Tulungagung marble quarries in East Java instead.

===Minaret===
The main structure is directly connected to the arcades that are spread around the large courtyard. The arcades connect the main building with a single minaret in the southern corner. Unlike many Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Indian mosques with multiple minarets, Istiqlal mosque has a single minaret to symbolize the divine oneness of God. It is 66.66 m tall to symbolize (incorrectly) the 6,666 verses in the Quran. The 30-metre-high stainless steel pinnacle on top of the minaret symbolizes the 30 juz&#x27; of the Quran. On the southern side near the minaret there is also a large &quot;bedug&quot; (large wooden drum made of cow skin). In common with the entire Islamic world, traditionally Muslims in Indonesia use the drum with the adhan (call to prayer). The mosque offices, function hall, and madrasah are on the ground floor. The mosque provides facilities for social and cultural activities.

Some Muslims in Indonesia said Istiqlal&#x27;s dome and minaret structure was much too modern and Arabic in style. They regarded the architecture as being out of harmony with Islamic culture and architecture in Indonesia. In response, former president Suharto began an initiative to construct more mosques of the Javanese triple-roofed design.

===Capacity===

Istiqlal Mosque can hold pilgrims as many as 200,001 people consisting of:

#The main prayer room and balcony and wing contain 61,000 people.
#The space in the preliminary building contains 8,000 people.
#The open terrace room on the 2nd floor contains 50,000 people.
#All corridors and other places contain 81,000 people.

==Facilities==
In a display of religious tolerance, during large Christian celebrations such as Christmas, Istiqlal Mosque helped provide parking space for worshippers of the nearby Jakarta Cathedral.

===Sound system and multimedia===
For the purpose of worship and information facilities, Istiqlal Mosque uses a centrally controlled sound system located on the rear glass room of the second floor, with the number of speakers as many as 200 channels spread on the main floor.

The number of speakers contained in the corridor, connecting building and preliminary building are 158 channels. The sound system is controlled by 26 amplifiers and 5 (five) mixers and is supervised by six people who take turns both day and night when in use.

To support the smooth communication at the time of worship and activity, on the main floor, there has also been installed a plasma TV system so that access information can be followed evenly by the pilgrims who are throughout the main room of the mosque and cannot directly see the preacher.

===Garden===
Istiqlal mosque is located on former Wilhelmina Park, thus prior of mosque construction, there are numbers of decorative plants and trees planted in the garden. Some of garden&#x27;s old large trees might be hundred years old. The park is also the location of a river branch, the distributary of Ciliwung river, completed with floodgates. The original river branch went westward to Molenvliet and turned northward along canal towards its estuarine in old Batavia. The other branch turned northward to a floodgate which drain eastward along a canal in front of Pasar Baru, the canal turned north along Jalan Gunung Sahari, all the way to Ancol in the north.

In the southwestern corner of the garden surrounding the mosque, there is a large pool and a grand fountain that spouts water high. The fountain only operates on Fridays during congregational salat and during Islamic holidays such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha. The river Ciliwung flows across the mosque complex along the eastern side of the mosque.

== Environmental initiatives ==
Grand Imam Nasaruddin Umar has led efforts to make the mosque more environmentally friendly, including installing solar panels, using slow-flow faucets, and implementing a water recycling system. The mosque&#x27;s efforts have earned it recognition as the first green-certified place of worship by the World Bank.

==Leadership==

Istiqlal Mosque has one Grand Imam, one Deputy Grand Imam, and seven imams. , the Grand Imam is the former Deputy Minister for Religious Affairs (2011–2014), Nasaruddin Umar and the Chairman of Istiqlal Mosque is the former Indonesian Ambassador to Syria (2006–2010), Muhammad Muzammil Basyuni.

==Visitors==

Following US President Barack Obama and his wife&#x27;s visit to the Istiqal Mosque in November 2010, about 20 visitors per day have come to tour the mosque. Among foreign dignitaries who have visited Istiqlal mosque are former US president Bill Clinton; President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi; Charles III of the United Kingdom; Li Yuanchao, former Vice President of China; President of Chile Sebastián Piñera; Heinz Fischer, the President of Austria; Jens Stoltenberg, the Prime Minister of Norway, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2012. King Salman Of Saudi Arabia visited the mosque during his Indonesia tour in March 2017.

<doc id="1319022" wikidata="Q945202" url="?curid=1319022" title="Phonological history of Spanish coronal fricatives">
<text>In Spanish dialectology, the realization of coronal fricatives is one of the most prominent features distinguishing various dialect regions. The main three realizations are the phonemic distinction between and (), the presence of only alveolar (), or, less commonly, the presence of only a denti-alveolar that is similar to ().

While an urban legend attributes the presence of the dental fricative to a Spanish king with a lisp, the various realizations of these coronal fricatives are actually a result of historical processes that date to the 15th century.

==Origins==
===Castilian &#x27;lisp&#x27;===
A persistent urban legend claims that the prevalence of the sound in Spanish can be traced to a Spanish king who spoke with a lisp, whose pronunciation spread via prestige borrowing to the rest of the population. This myth has been discredited by scholars. traces the origins of the legend to a chronicle of Pero López de Ayala which says that Peter of Castile &quot;lisped a little&quot; (). However, Peter reigned in the 14th century and the sound began to develop in the 16th century (see below). Moreover, a true lisp would not give rise to the systematic distinction between and that characterizes Standard Peninsular pronunciation. For example, a lisp would lead one to pronounce (&#x27;I feel&#x27;) and (&#x27;hundred&#x27;) the same (as ) whereas in standard peninsular Spanish they are pronounced and .

The misnomer &quot;Castilian lisp&quot; is used occasionally to refer to the presence of in Peninsular pronunciation (in both and varieties).

===Historical evolution===

In the 15th century, Spanish had developed a large number of sibilant phonemes: seven by some accounts, eight by others (depending on whether and are considered contrasting), more than any current dialect. During the 16th and early 17th centuries these phonemes merged differently as they evolved into those of the different modern dialects. There were four pairs of voiceless versus voiced sibilants: dental/alveolar affricates vs. (spelled or vs. ); dental/alveolar fricatives (spelled when intervocalic, otherwise) vs. (intervocalic only, spelled ); postalveolar affricates (spelled ) vs. ; and postalveolar fricatives (spelled ) vs. . Both and were spelled before or, and elsewhere. It is likely that deaffricated and merged with before the year 1500. The main difference between the prestige dialect of north central Spain and dialects to the south (such as Andalusian Spanish) was that, in the north, the dental/alveolar continuants were more retracted than the affricates (the former pair can be represented as and and the latter as and ), keeping their phonemic distinction, while in the south they were homorganic. The first step away from that system was the deaffrication of in the first quarter of the 16th century. Because of a differing place of articulation, this still contrasted with in the prestige dialect of north central Spain, though it was a complete merger for southern dialects.

The second step was the devoicing of voiced sibilants. In the north, and were lost, but remained contrastive with its new pronunciation , because there had been no voiceless previously. This sound contrasted with two acoustically similar sounds: dentoalveolar and apicoalveolar . By 1600, , too, had deaffricated and merged with the earlier that had already developed from . Subsequent changes to the sound system of Spanish retained the contrasts while enhancing the segments by increasing articulatory distance amongst their rather subtle acoustic contrasts, an appropriate step due to the high productivity of these phonemes in differentiating frequently used minimal pairs. The dentoalveolar one was moved &quot;forward&quot; to interdental , losing its former sibilance in the process (which increased its acoustic distance to the remaining sibilant ), and the prepalatal one was moved &quot;backward&quot; to velar , also losing its former sibilance, all in all resulting in the three-way distinction of modern Standard Peninsular pronunciation:

In the south, the devoicing process and deaffrication of gave rise to new fricatives that were indistinguishable from the existing ones. The process of increasing articulatory distance still applied, however, and retracted to in the south just as it did in the north. In a number of areas (particularly the southernmost provinces like Cádiz) developed into a non-sibilant apico-dental , perceptually similar to the interdental used by Standard Peninsular speakers for orthographic /. In areas (particularly in the westernmost provinces like Seville and Huelva), the resulting phoneme developed a predorsal alveolar realization (like English ), perceptually similar to the apicoalveolar used by Standard Peninsular speakers for orthographic . This variety was the pronunciation that most impacted Latin America, as many emigrants to the Americas were from Andalusian and Canarian ports. In addition, several generations of Spanish speakers had lived and grown in the Americas before appeared in Castilian.

The development of the sibilants in Ladino (which split off from Castilian and other Peninsular varieties in the 15th century) was more conservative, resulting in a system closer to that of Portuguese.

==Distinction==
Distinction () refers to the differentiated pronunciation of the two Spanish phonemes written and or (only before or , the so-called &quot;soft&quot;):

# represents a voiceless alveolar sibilant (either laminal as in English, or apical);
# and soft represent a voiceless dental fricative (the in &quot;think&quot;).

By the early 1700s the six sibilant phonemes of medieval Spanish had all merged into three phonemes in the dialects with this distinction and two phonemes elsewhere, but spelling still reflected the older pronunciation system. From 1726 to 1815 the RAE reformed spelling, resulting in a modern Spanish orthography which reflects the system with distinction. This distinction is universal in Central and Northern parts of Spain, except for some bilingual speakers of Catalan and Basque, according to , as well as some bilingual speakers of Galician whose dialect has this trait (but not all).

In most of Spain, this distinction is between an apical and a dental . That said, in most regions of Andalusia which distinguish and , the distinction involves a laminal . According to , the distinction between a laminal and is native to most of Almería, eastern Granada, most of Jaén, and northern Huelva, while the distinction between an apical and , as found in the rest of Peninsular Spanish, is native to the very northeastern regions of Almería, Granada and Jaén, to northern Córdoba, not including the provincial capital, and to a small region of northern Huelva.

==Lack of distinction==
In most Spanish-speaking regions and countries the phonemic distinction between and does not exist. These varieties of Spanish are sometimes said to exhibit (&#x27;neutralization&#x27;) as opposed to .

===Seseo===
 is a lack of distinction between /s/ and /θ/ with both being realized as . For example, the words (&#x27;house&#x27;) and (&#x27;hunt&#x27;) would be pronounced with the same sound. This can result in ambiguity but can usually be interpreted depending on the context of which the sentence is spoken. is the most widespread pronunciation among Spanish speakers worldwide and occurs in nearly all speakers in Hispanic America. While it is a minority pronunciation in Spain itself, is considered standard in all varieties of Latin American Spanish, as well as in the Philippines. It coexists with and in parts of Spain (e.g. in the Canary Islands, much of Andalusia, historically in southern Murcia, western Badajoz, and the western coast of Galicia). Traditional dialect atlases (e.g., ) show one variant or another used in adjacent regions. In Spain, is considered &quot;more socially acceptable or perhaps &#x27;less substandard&#x27; than &quot;.

===Ceceo===
 (sometimes transcribed in English sources according to pronunciation as thetheo) is a phenomenon found in a few dialects of southern Spain in which and are not distinguished and there is only one coronal fricative phoneme realized as the voiceless denti-alveolar sibilant , a sibilant sounding somewhat like , but not identical. is found primarily in some varieties of Andalusian Spanish, and historically in two villages of southeastern Murcia. That said, Hualde reports that there is some evidence of the phenomenon in parts of Central America. A publication of the University of Oviedo also notes that can be found in Argentina and Chile. Other linguists have noticed the use of in parts of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Venezuela. A similar sound characterized as a &quot;voiceless apico-or corono-post-dental slit fricative&quot; has been observed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela; In these places, ceceo is a largely rural pronunciation and is often stigmatized.

In El Salvador, some speakers use a -like fricative in the syllable instead of the usual glottal , , or phonetic zero, rendering &#x27;all&#x27; (plural) as , more usually pronounced or (the latter homophonous with &quot;&quot; &#x27;all&#x27; (singular)). Salvadoran Spanish occasionally weakens, but almost never completely deletes, in onset positions, and this allophone is more common in onset positions than coda ones. According to , this is the result of a gestural undershoot. It is on an acoustic continuum between and , representing an intermediate degree of lenition. identifies this with the of Andalusian and other dialects. The following table gives an example of the three pronunciation patterns discussed so far:
===Ceseo or seceo===
Many speakers of and dialects in Spain show sociolinguistic variation in usage. In some cases, this variation may arise when a or speaker more or less consciously attempts to use in response to sociolinguistic pressure (hypercorrection). However, as, for instance, in the case of the variation between the standard velar nasal and alveolar pronunciation of the nasal in &quot;-ing&quot; in English (&quot;walking&quot; versus &quot;walkin″&quot;), the switching may be entirely unconscious. It is perhaps evidence of the saliency of three-way variation that inconsistent use has elicited evaluative comments by some traditional Spanish dialectologists. For instance, discussed it as &quot;sporadic or chaotic switching [between and ] and the use of intermediate sounds impossible to determine with precision&quot;. proposes the synonymous terms and to refer to these &quot;mixed&quot; patterns, and notes surprise at a speaker who produced all four possible pronunciations of &quot;Zaragoza&quot; (, , and ) within the space of a few minutes. In fact, sociolinguistic variation is typically highly structured in terms of how often each variant will appear given various social and linguistic independent variables. The Spanish spoken by the inhabitants of the Canary Islands is exclusively , but exclusive is quite rare in mainland Spain – even in areas, such as Seville, listed as being majority .

<text>David Howard Murdock (born April 11, 1923) is an American billionaire businessman, plant-based diet advocate and philanthropist.

==Early career==
Murdock was born on April 11, 1923, in Kansas City, Missouri. His father was a traveling salesman; his mother worked as a laundress and housekeeper to make ends meet. He is the middle child of three; he had two sisters. He was close to his mother, who died at 42 of cancer. He grew up in Montgomery Township, Ohio, and dropped out of high school in the 9th grade. He was drafted by the United States Army in 1943 during World War II.

Upon relocating to Detroit after the war, Murdock was homeless and destitute. Due to a chance encounter with a good samaritan, he obtained a $1,200 loan to buy a closing diner, flipping it for a $700 profit ten months later. He moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and began working there, first in housing and then commercial real estate.

When the real estate market collapsed in the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles where he continued developing real estate opportunities, leading to a string of acquisitions. In 1978 he acquired control of International Mining. He became the largest shareholder in L.A.-based Occidental Petroleum, by selling the corporation his 18% share of the Iowa Beef Packers company for $800 million worth of Occidental stock in May 1981 with support from Armand Hammer: after this acquisition, Occidental, through its ownership of IBP and with support from Leonid Kostandov, became the largest United States supplier of beef to the Soviet Union.

==Businesses==
Murdock purchased Cannon Mills in Kannapolis, North Carolina, in 1982. At the time, the company was profitable and had no debts. He used the company&#x27;s profits to pay back the loans he secured to make the acquisition before terminating 2,000 positions and selling the company-owned homes. He eliminated the company&#x27;s $100 million pensions plan, taking $36 million to make personal investments and using the remainder to purchase annuity policies from Executive Life Insurance Company for Cannon employees. Executive Life later failed due to its own poor investments and reduced its payouts to retired employees. Murdock sold the Cannon Mills to Fieldcrest in 1985.

In 1985 Murdock took over the nearly bankrupt Hawaiian firm Castle &amp; Cooke, which owned pineapple and banana producer Dole Food Company. He developed Castle &amp; Cooke&#x27;s real estate portfolio into residential and commercial properties and turned Dole into the world&#x27;s largest producer of fruits and vegetables. Acquiring Dole privately in 2003, Murdock completed a $446 million initial public offering in October 2009 and the company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker DOLE until a private merger agreement was approved October 31, 2013. As a result of his purchase of Castle &amp; Cooke, Murdock acquired ownership of 98% of Lanai, the sixth-largest island in Hawaii. In June 2012 Murdock sold his interest in Lanai to Larry Ellison. He owns other companies, including Pacific Clay.

==Philanthropy==
He has helped contribute to the redevelopment of a complex in Kannapolis, North Carolina, of a biotechnology research center, the North Carolina Research Campus. The research center is a joint public-private venture, involving major North Carolina universities and private investment. The site of the research center in the middle of Kannapolis was formerly occupied by Plant #1 of Cannon Mills (which became Pillowtex after a series of mergers and acquisitions). Pillowtex filed for bankruptcy in 2003, and closed the mill. This resulted in the largest mass layoff of workers in North Carolina history. Murdock acquired the site and demolished the mill in 2006.

Since the death of his third wife, Gabriele, he has been involved to finding a cure for cancer, advancing nutrition, and life extension. He established the Dole Nutrition Institute to advocate the benefits of a plant-based diet to promote health and prevent disease. With the help of UCLA, he oversaw the writing of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Foods, A Guide to Healthy Nutrition&quot;. In 2006, he opened the California Health and Longevity Institute (CHLI).

Murdock has contributed more than $500 million toward the creation of the North Carolina Research Campus and David H. Murdock Research Institute which research the health benefits of plants in boosting longevity and reducing disease risk.

==Personal life==

He has been married six times. In 1967, he married his third wife, Gabriele; they had two children together and he also adopted her son from a previous marriage, Eugene. Gabriele was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1983 and died in 1985. A year later, Eugene died after hitting his head while swimming in the family estate&#x27;s swimming pool. In 2004 his son David Jr. died in an auto accident on the Santa Monica Freeway. His remaining son Justin is CEO and executive chairman of NovaRx and is senior vice president of investments for Castle &amp; Cooke. Previously, Justin was a director at the Dole Food Company, as well as their audit and finance committee until his retirement on May 17, 2013. In 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked David Sr. as the 190th-richest person in the &quot;Forbes 400&quot; list and 613th in the &quot;World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; list, with a net worth of US$2.4 billion as of March 2013.

Since 1985 Murdock has been a pescetarian and promotes a plant-based diet that is high in fruits and vegetables. He drinks smoothies two or three times a day with as many as twenty fruits and vegetables, including pulverized banana and orange peels. He eats fish, seafood, egg whites, legumes and nuts whilst avoiding dairy, poultry and red meat. He also shuns the use of alcohol, processed sugar and salt. Murdock does not take vitamin supplements and claims he can live to 125 years on his plant-based diet.

<doc id="1319032" wikidata="Q1158144" url="?curid=1319032" title="FitzGerald dynasty">
<text>The FitzGerald dynasty is a Hiberno-Norman noble and aristocratic dynasty, originally of Cambro-Norman and Anglo-Norman origin. They have been peers of Ireland since at least the 13th century, and are described in the Annals of the Four Masters as having become &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot; or Gaels, due to assimilation with the native Gaelic aristocratic and popular culture. The dynasty has also been referred to as the Geraldines and Ireland&#x27;s largest landowners. They achieved power through colonisation and the conquest of large swathes of Irish territory by the sons and grandsons of Gerald de Windsor (c. 1075 – 1135). Gerald de Windsor (Gerald FitzWalter) was the first Castellan of Pembroke Castle in Wales, and became the male progenitor of the FitzMaurice and FitzGerald Dynasty (&quot;fitz&quot;, from the Anglo-Norman &quot;fils&quot; indicating &quot;sons of&quot; Gerald). His father, Baron Walter FitzOther, was the first Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle for William the Conqueror, and was the Lord of 38 manors in England, making the FitzGeralds one of the &quot;service families&quot; on whom the King relied for his survival. Some of its members became the Black Knights, Green Knights and White Knights. 

The main branches of the family are: 
* The FitzMaurices and FitzGeralds of Kildare (Earls of Kildare from 1316, later Marquesses of Kildare and from 1766 Dukes of Leinster and Premier Peers of Ireland). The current head is Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Duke of Leinster.
* The Fitzmaurices and FitzGeralds of Desmond (Barons Desmond, later Earls of Desmond).

==Overview==
The progenitor of the Irish FitzGerald dynasty was a Cambro-Norman Marcher Lord named Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan, son of Gerald de Windsor and Princess Nest ferch Rhys, of the Welsh royal House of Dinefwr. Maurice married a daughter of the Norman magnate Arnulf de Montgomery: the Montgomeries, lords of 150 manors and 30 castles, were the most powerful magnates in both England and Normandy, and were of the same family as William the Conqueror. His wife&#x27;s maternal grandfather was the High King of Ireland, Muirchertach Ua Briain (see Arnulf de Montgomery) which may have influenced the important role Maurice played the 1169 Norman invasion of Ireland.

The FitzGeralds claim kinship with the Tudors who descended from the same Welsh royal line as Princess Nest&#x27;s father, Rhys ap Tewdwr, King of Deheubarth. Consequently, the FitzMaurices and FitzGeralds are cousins to the Tudors (Tewdwrs in Welsh) through Princess Nest and her Welsh family.

In his poetry, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, a cousin of Anne Boleyn, also referred to Countess Elizabeth FitzGerald, (1527–89) as &quot;Fair Geraldine&quot;, alluding to her family&#x27;s Italian ancestry through the Gherardinis of Florence. The FitzGerald dynasty has played a major role in Irish history. Gearóid Mór, 8th Earl of Kildare and his son Gearóid Óg, 9th Earl of Kildare, were Lord Deputy of Ireland in the late-fifteenth and early-sixteenth centuries respectively. Both married to cousins of Henry Tudor, first monarch of the House of Tudor.

During the Italian War of 1521–1526, James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond, conspired with the Venetians and King Francis I of France, of Château de Chambord, against the Habsburgs, Tudors and Medicis. After the war, he sided once again against England, and allied himself with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor during the War of the League of Cognac. Another notable rebel was Commander James FitzMaurice FitzGerald, who led the Desmond Rebellions against the Tudors, and negotiated with Catherine de&#x27; Medici with the ambition of making her son, Henry III of France, the new King of Ireland. Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond led the Second Desmond Rebellion with the help of the King of Spain, Philip of Habsburg, and Pope Gregory XIII, in an attempt to put on the throne Duke Giacomo Boncompagni.

Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare (died 1537), known as &quot;Silken Thomas,&quot; also led an unsuccessful insurrection in Ireland, while Lord Edward FitzGerald (1763–1798), the fifth son of the first duke of Leinster, was a leading figure in the 1798 Irish Rebellion against King George III of the House of Hanover. Thomas&#x27;s half-brother, the 11th Earl, nicknamed the &quot;Wizard Earl&quot;, went into exile in Italy, joined the Geraldine League, and became a member of the household of the Duke of Mantua, of the Gonzaga family, and Master of Horse to Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

In Irish history, an example of the FitzGerald dynasty becoming &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot; is Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond (1335–1398), who was also known by the Irish Gaelic &quot;Gearóid Iarla&quot; (Earl Gerald).
Although made Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1367, Gerald wrote poetry in the Irish language, most famously the poem &quot;Mairg adeir olc ris na mnáibh&quot; (&quot;Speak not ill of womenkind&quot;). Indeed, although an accomplished poet in Norman French, Gerald was instrumental in the move by the Fitzmaurices and Fitzgeralds of Desmond toward greater use of the Irish language.

===Modern times===
Many members of the Fitzmaurices also became notable over the centuries, such as William Petty Fitzmaurice, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, the Prime Minister of Britain who negotiated with Benjamin Franklin and secured peace with America at the end of the American War of Independence, or Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, Viceroy of Canada and India, who became a half-nephew of Emperor Napoleon III, a step-grandson of Queen Hortense Bonaparte, and a great-grandson of Talleyrand, connecting the family with the Houses of Beauharnais, Talleyrand, and Bonaparte. The Treaty of Paris (1783), that gave the independence to the United States was drafted from William&#x27;s home at Lansdowne House, and Henry was made a member of the prominent Brooks&#x27;s Club, alongside the 8th Duke of Devonshire of Chatsworth House, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery of Mentmore Towers, and Baron Lionel de Rothschild, grandson of Mayer Amschel, founder of the House of Rothschild.

The present-day seat of the Irish Parliament Dáil Éireann is housed in Leinster House, which was first built in 1745–48 by James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster as the ducal palace for the Dukes of Leinster. The White House in the United States, seat of the U.S. President, was based on Leinster House, and was designed by Irish architect James Hoban for George Washington, who also supervised the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s construction for Thomas Jefferson. The Dukes were related to the Royal houses of Bourbon, Medici, and Habsburg, among others, as the first Duke married the great-granddaughter of King Charles II of the Royal House of Stuart. Charles&#x27;s mother, Queen Henrietta Maria de Bourbon, was the aunt of Louis XIV of Versailles, while his grandmother and great-grandmother were the Queens Marie de&#x27; Medici and Joanna of Habsburg. The current Duke is Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Duke of Leinster, who is also the 9th Marquess of Kildare, 28th Earl of Kildare, 9th Earl of Offaly, 9th Viscount Leinster of Taplow, 14th Baron Offaly, 6th Baron Kildare.

==Cambro-Norman origins==
The surname &quot;FitzGerald&quot; is a patronymic of the Norman form, &quot;fitz&quot; meaning &quot;son&quot;. &quot;Fitz Gerald&quot; thus means in Old Norman and in Old French &quot;son of Gerald&quot;. &quot;Gerald&quot; itself is a Germanic compound of &quot;ger&quot;, &quot;spear&quot;, and &quot;waltan&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;. Variant spellings include &quot;Fitz-Gerald&quot; and the modern &quot;Fitzgerald&quot;. The name can also appear as two separate words &quot;Fitz Gerald&quot;.

The earliest recorded use of the patronymic FitzGerald is that of Raoul fitz Gerald le Chambellan, member of the Tancarville family. Raoul was a Norman baron, Chamberlain of Normandy, educator of the young William, future Conqueror of England, and father of William de Tancarville, Earl of Tankerville and chief chamberlain of Normandy and England after the Norman conquest. The eponymous ancestor of the various FitzGerald branches, as well as of the de Barry and FitzMaurice families, was Gerald FitzWalter of Windsor. Gerald was a Norman adventurer who took part in the 1093 invasion of South Wales upon the death in battle of Rhys ap Tewdwr, last king of South Wales.

Gerald was the youngest son of another Norman adventurer, Walter fitz Otho, William the Conqueror&#x27;s Constable for the strategic military fortress of Windsor Castle, as well as the King&#x27;s Keeper of the Forests of Berkshire. Domesday Book records Walter fitz Otho as tenant-in-chief of lands formerly held by conquered Englishmen in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, and Middlesex. Walter&#x27;s positions and most of his lands were inherited by Gerald&#x27;s older brothers, Robert, Maurice, and William, the oldest, ancestor of the earls of Plymouth, while Gerald inherited the estate of Moulsford, now in Oxfordshire, near to Wallingford, where his father owned a fortified house adjacent to those of other powerful Norman authorities.

Nest ferch Rhys ap Tewdwr was the daughter of the last king of South Wales by his wife, Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn of Powys. Their grandchildren, Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan, Raymond le Gros and Philip de Barry were leaders in the Norman invasion of Ireland. Nest&#x27;s son by her second marriage, Robert FitzStephen, was another participant, as was William de Hay, husband of one of Gerald&#x27;s and Nest&#x27;s granddaughters. Nest&#x27;s grandson (through her son by Henry I of England, son of William the Conqueror), named Meiler FitzHenry, was appointed Lord Justice of Ireland for his cousin, King Henry II of England, member of the House of Plantagenet.

The most renowned of Gerald&#x27;s and Nest&#x27;s grandchildren, Gerald of Wales, gave an account of the Norman invasion, as well as lively and invaluable descriptions of Ireland and Wales in the late 12th century. He became Archdeacon of Brecon, serving Archbishop Baldwin of Forde, a past tutor of Pope Eugene III&#x27;s nephew, and worked with him at recruiting members for the Third Crusade of Richard the Lionheart against Saladin. On many attempts Gerald tried to become the Bishop of St. Davids but failed, despite having met in Rome Pope Innocent III, who would later experienced the Sack of Constantinople. More than twenty works has been produced by Gerald of Wales, and his statue can be seen today in City Hall, Cardiff, in Wales.

==Gherardini of Ireland==
The earliest record of the House of Gherardini of Ireland, represented by the FitzGeralds, can be traced back in the year 1413 to the accounts of Lord Antonio d&#x27;Ottaviano di Rossellino Gherardini. A priest named Maurice Fitzgerald was of passage in Florence at that time, with a Bishop of the Order of Saint Augustine, and has been able to enter in contact with one of his fellow kinsman, who then introduced him to other members of the Gherardinis. As being part of the Gherardini family that dwelt in the island of Ireland, further exchanges were eventually done by the family to meet again. A letter written in 1440 by the Chancellor of Florence, Leonardo Bruni, one of the associates of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, stipulated that Giovanni Betti di Gherardini, a representative of the family, was sent to Ireland to become acquainted with his other kinsmen from the Geraldines of Ireland, the Earls of Kildare.
Confirmed as well in 1507 by the Viceroy of Ireland, Gerald Fitzgerald, to Giovanni Manni, a Florentine merchant in passage to Ireland. Gerald Fitzgerald&#x27;s letters were signed as &quot;Gerald, Chief in Ireland of the family of the Gherardini&quot;. His son, the 9th Earl of Kildare, was also known as Lord Garrett, which translates as Signore Gherardini in Italian, and was married to Elizabeth Grey of the Royal House of Grey, a granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth Woodville. A letter written in 1566 by Girolamo Fortini, who was married to a daughter of Antonio Gherardini from Florence, to his brother in London, also stated that the Earl of Kildare was of the same family.

Cristoforo Landino, tutor of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, stated in his preface of the Divine Comedy (Comedia) of the famous poet Dante Alighieri, that the descendants of Tommaso, Gherardo, and Maurizio Gherardini were the ancestors of the Earls of Kildare and Earls of Desmonds, and went on to Conquer Ireland with the King of England. The Divine Comedy was first launch at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. The English poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, user of the sonnet form that would later be used by William Shakespeare, also referred to the ancestral seat of the Geraldines in Florence in his poem &quot;Description and praise of his love&quot;.

Since the 15th century, the FitzGeralds and the Gherardinis are known to be in touch and to acknowledge their kinship. A 2014 cover story published by &quot;Sette&quot;, the Italian weekly magazine of Corriere della Sera, was an article dedicated to the Gherardini family of Montagliari and their relationship with the FitzGerald Family as well as with the Kennedy family. According to the magazine, the three families have maintained relationship among them even in recent times or in the past (for example with American President John Fitzgerald Kennedy). The link with the Kennedy family came from the Earl of Desmond branch, and can be seen on the coat of arms granted to John FitzGerald Kennedy by the Chief Herald of Ireland.

====FitzMaurice of Kerry====
The closely related FitzMaurice Barons and later Earls of Kerry continue in the male line with the current Petty-FitzMaurice Marquesses of Lansdowne, but they descend from John FitzGerald, 1st Baron Desmond&#x27;s nephew, Thomas FitzMaurice, 1st Baron of Kerry, son of his brother Maurice FitzThomas. Thus in fact they represent a &quot;sister&quot; branch to the FitzGeralds of Desmond. However this technically makes them slightly closer to the FitzGeralds of Desmond than either are to the Offaly-Kildare-Leinster Geraldines, represented by the modern Dukes of Leinster, who descend from Gerald FitzMaurice, 1st Lord of Offaly, uncle of the 1st Baron Desmond.

====House of Corsygedol====

The House of Corsygedol (Vaughans) is a branch of the Lords of Desmond, now Earls of Desmond, and was founded by Osborn Wyddel (Fitzgerald-Osbourne), a descendant of Gerald de Windsor. Wyddel, arrived in Wales (Kingdom of Gwynedd) from Ireland with Prince Llywelyn the Great and was granted estates and arms, he married a ward of Llywelyn, who was also an heiress of the Corsygedol and Plas Hen estates in Gwynedd. They flourished in North Wales for centuries, by the 18th century, their Corsygedol estates were inherited by the Mostyn baronets family through marriage.

Its cadet branches are the House of Yale (Yale family) of Plas-yn-Yale, and the Hughes of Gwerclas of Gwerclas, native royal families of the Mathrafal dynasty. Their coat of arms are those of Osborn Fitzgerald ; viz. erm. on saltire gu. a crescent or. Crest is a wild boar in a toil.

====Hereditary knights====
These three hereditary knighthoods were created for their kinsmen by the Earls of Desmond, acting as Earls Palatine.
* Knight of Kerry (Green Knight) – the holder is Sir Adrian FitzGerald, 6th Baronet of Valencia, 24th Knight of Kerry. He is also a Knight of Malta, and President of the Irish Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
* Knight of Glin (Black Knight) – dormant (from 2011), after the death of Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin, the ancestral seat for over 700 years is Glin Castle.
* White Knight (Fitzgibbon family) – dormant (from 1611), after the death of Maurice Oge Fitzgibbon, 12th White Knight.

Greater London, (500), Greater Manchester (191), West Midlands (176), Lancashire (130), Kent (118), Essex (117), West Yorkshire (113), Merseyside (108), Hampshire (84), and Surrey (76).&quot;

&quot;Fitzgerald&quot; (including &quot;FitzGerald,&quot; as the survey was not case-sensitive), was the 390th most common surname in the 2000 United States census. 73,522 Fitzgeralds were counted, with 27.25 Fitzgeralds per 100,000 members of the population.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Saltire, sometimes used to represent Ireland in modern flags, may have derived from the arms of the Geraldines.

The in the United States Navy is named for Lieutenant William Charles Fitzgerald, USN. The Fitzgerald family coat of arms (a white shield with a red saltire) provides the foundation for the coat of arms for USS &quot;Fitzgerald&quot;.

<text>Edward Samuel &quot;Ted&quot; Rogers Jr., (May 27, 1933 – December 2, 2008) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist who served as the president and CEO of Rogers Communications. He was the fifth-richest person in Canada in terms of net worth.

== Life and career ==
Rogers was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Velma Melissa (Taylor) and radio pioneer and inventor Edward S. Rogers Sr. He was educated at Upper Canada College. He subsequently attended Trinity College in the University of Toronto, graduating in 1956 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. When he was an undergraduate student, Rogers joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. In 1979, he was named a &quot;Significant Sig&quot; by the fraternity – the 21st Canadian to be inducted.

In 1960, while still a student at Osgoode Hall Law School, he bought all the shares in local radio station CHFI, which pioneered the use of FM at a time when only 5% of the Toronto households had FM receivers. By 1965, he was in the cable TV business. Rogers Communications was established in 1967 and grew into one of Canada&#x27;s largest media conglomerates. His father, Edward S. Rogers Sr., is regarded as the founder of the company, although the radio station that he established, CFRB, is now owned by another Canadian company and competitor, Bell Media.

Rogers had been the owner of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team since September 1, 2000, when Rogers Communications Inc. purchased 80% of the baseball club, with the Labatt Brewing Company maintaining a 20% interest and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce relinquishing its 10% share. He purchased the remaining 20% share from Labatt in 2003, and owned the team in full until his death. Moreover, the Blue Jays&#x27; home ballpark, SkyDome, was renamed Rogers Centre in 2005 after Rogers&#x27; firm purchased the stadium (including naming rights).

== Marriage and family ==
On September 25, 1963, Rogers married Loretta Anne Robinson. Her father was Roland Robinson, 1st Baron Martonmere, who was a British politician and later served as Governor of Bermuda. Rogers and his wife had four children together: Lisa, Edward, Melinda and Martha. He was a direct descendant of Timothy Rogers (1756–1834), a Quaker leader who founded Newmarket and Pickering in what is now Ontario.

== Honours and awards ==
On October 25, 1990, Rogers was appointed to the grade of Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1990, Rogers received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2006, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Telecommunications Hall of Fame, along with his father, Edward S. Rogers Sr. In 2010, Rogers was inducted into the Wireless Hall of Fame for his role in the cellular industry.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2000, Rogers and his wife Loretta gave to the University of Toronto. The landmark contribution was directed to the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, which named the &quot;Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering&quot; in honour of his father. The Rogers&#x27; gift allowed the faculty to establish the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Graduate Scholarships, the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Undergraduate Scholarships, the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Chair in Engineering, the Velma M. Rogers Graham Chair in Engineering, the Rogers AT&amp;T Wireless Communications Laboratories and the Rogers Scholarship Program.

On May 29, 2007, Rogers and his wife made a gift of to Ryerson University. The donation was directed towards the Faculty of Business, which was renamed the Ted Rogers School of Management at the donors&#x27; request. The majority of the gift will be used to establish 52 new undergraduate and graduate student awards and scholarships. The gift also aims to establish a new research chair to seed academic initiatives in management research.

On November 20, 2014, the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research was launched after a gift from Rogers&#x27; family in his memory. It was at the time the largest private gift in Canadian health-care history. This Centre united The Hospital for Sick Children, University Health Network and the University of Toronto in taking new approaches to how we diagnose, treat and prevent heart failure in adults and children. It is believed to be the world&#x27;s first institute to bring together research, education and innovation in personalized medicine, stem cell research, bioengineering, regenerative medicine, digital health and advanced clinical care under one umbrella with a single focus.

== Death and commemoration ==

Rogers suffered from congestive heart failure and died early on the morning of December 2, 2008, aged 75, at his home in Toronto. He was buried in the family plot at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

His autobiography, penned with communications consultant and former business journalist Robert Brehl, was titled &quot;Relentless: The True Story of the Man Behind Rogers Communications&quot; and was released just 10 weeks before Rogers&#x27; death. On December 2, 2009, the first anniversary of his death, a northern section of Jarvis Street in Toronto which runs beside the Rogers Building was renamed Ted Rogers Way in his honour.

From March 4 to 6, 2010, the first annual Ted Rogers Memorial Conference (TRMC) hosted by Ryerson University, the Ted Rogers School of Management, and the Ryerson Commerce Society took place to honour Rogers, inviting Canadian university students to learn more about the values and skills that Rogers possessed. The theme of the conference revolved around the acronym TED: Take risks. Embrace innovation. Defy the status quo.

<text>Benjamin Whichcote (March 1609 – May 1683) was an English Establishment and Puritan divine, 
Provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and leader of the Cambridge Platonists. He held that man is the &quot;child of reason&quot; and so not completely depraved by nature, as Puritans held. He also argued for religious toleration.

==Life and career==
Whichcote was born at Whichcote Hall in Stoke upon Tern, Shropshire. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1628, and became a fellow in 1633. In 1637, he was ordained a deacon and priest at the same time. In 1643, he married and took up priestly duties in a Cambridge-dispensed parish in North Cadbury, Somerset. In 1644, he became 19th Provost of King&#x27;s College due to Parliamentary control of the universities. However, he was the only new head of house who did not subscribe to the National Covenant. In 1650, during the Interregnum, he was vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and advised Oliver Cromwell on the subject of toleration of the Jews. After the Restoration he was removed from his position at King&#x27;s College, but reinstated when he accepted the Act of Uniformity in 1662.

From that time he was the Curate of St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Blackfriars, until it burnt down in 1666. In 1668, he was appointed Vicar of St Lawrence Jewry. He was a brother to Jeremy Whichcote and Elizabeth Foxcroft, wife of Ezechiel Foxcroft.

Whichcote was one of the leaders of the Cambridge Platonists, and had liberal views. In 1650, he was involved in a controversy with his former teacher and friend Anthony Tuckney. He was opposed to the doctrine of total depravity and adopted a semi-Pelagian position, holding that man is the &quot;child of reason&quot;, and therefore not, as the Puritans held, of a completely depraved nature. He argued that there are some questions beyond the ability of reasonable and religious people to solve, and he therefore called for religious toleration. He was accused at various times by various persons of being an Arminian, Socinian, and Latitudinarian.

He died in Cambridge in May 1683 aged 74 and was buried in London at the church of St Lawrence Jewry.

==Works==
Nearly all of his works were published posthumously. They include &quot;Select Notions of B. Whichcote&quot; (1685), &quot;Select Sermons&quot; (1689), &quot;Discourses&quot; (1701), and &quot;Moral and Religious Aphorisms&quot; (1703).

<text>Edwin Percy Whipple (March 8, 1819 – June 16, 1886) was an American essayist and critic.

==Biography==
He was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1819. For a time, he was the main literary critic for Philadelphia-based &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Later, in 1848, he became the Boston correspondent to &quot;The Literary World&quot; under Evert Augustus Duyckinck and George Long Duyckinck. Historian Perry Miller called Whipple &quot;Boston&#x27;s most popular critic&quot;.

Whipple was also a public lecturer. In 1850, he defended the intelligence of George Washington and compared him to other brilliant men of his time in a speech which later became known as &quot;The Genius of Washington&quot;.

Whipple was a close friend of Nathaniel Hawthorne. After Hawthorne&#x27;s death in 1864, Whipple served as a pallbearer for his funeral alongside Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, James T. Fields, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Whipple&#x27;s close relationship with other Boston-area authors occasionally tinted his reviews. Edward Emerson later noted, &quot;No other member of the Saturday Club has ever been more loyally felicitous in characterizing the literary work of his associates.&quot;

Whipple died in 1886 and was interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Selected list of works==

His first book was &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; (two volumes, 1848), which was followed by:
* &quot;Literature and Life&quot; (1850) 
* &quot;Character and Characteristic Men&quot; (1866)
* &quot;Success and its Conditions&quot; (1871)
* &quot;Literature of the Age of Elizabeth&quot; (1876)
* &quot;Recollections of Eminent Men&quot; (1887)
* &quot;American Literature and Other Papers&quot; (1887)
* &quot;Outlooks on Society, Literature and Politics&quot; (1888)

An edition of his &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; (two volumes, Boston), with an introduction by Arlo Bates, appeared in 1912.

<doc id="1319054" wikidata="Q8074625" url="?curid=1319054" title="Zouch">
<text>Zouch is a hamlet in south west Nottinghamshire, England. It is located between Hathern and Normanton on Soar and is situated by the River Soar, which marks the county boundary with Leicestershire.

Most of the hamlet lies in the civil parish of Sutton Bonington, apart from Zouch Farm which falls within Normanton on Soar parish, and the part in Leicestershire which is in Hathern parish. The nearest town is Loughborough. The A6006 road passes through the hamlet and crosses the Soar on Zouch Bridge (alternatively &quot;County Bridge&quot; as it spans the county border). The elevation of Zouch is .

There is a pub in the hamlet, the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot;, with one side of the pub on Main Street and the other on the bank of the Zouch Cut canal. On the far western end of the hamlet, on the Leicestershire side of Zouch Bridge, is the County Bridge Mobile Home Park, where tent pitching is available.

==River Soar and Zouch Cut==

Zouch is an example of a small canal settlement, though there was a mill there long before the Soar was made navigable (and on some historic maps is denoted as Zouch Mill). Due to the canalisation of the River Soar, involving the construction of the Zouch Cut and several weirs and canals in the vicinity, the hamlet lies on several islands (including the main island, and the much smaller islands of Lower Holme and Upper Holme, which have small houses on them). Canal mooring is a notable feature; on the Leicestershire side of Zouch Bridge, situated on the River Soar, are Zouch Marina and the clubhouse of the Loughborough Boat Club. The Long Whatton Brook joins the Soar between the two.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name derives from the Old English term for poor ground.

It is alphabetically last in a list of all the named settlements in Britain.

<doc id="1319057" wikidata="Q5040484" url="?curid=1319057" title="Carl Lindner Jr.">
<text>Carl Henry Lindner Jr. (April 22, 1919 – October 17, 2011) was an American businessman from Norwood, Ohio, a member of the Lindner family, and one of the world&#x27;s richest people. According to the 2010 issue of &quot;Forbes&quot; Billionaires List, Lindner was worth an estimated $1.7 billion.

==Life and career==
Lindner was born on April 22, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio. He grew up in Norwood, an enclave of Cincinnati, Ohio. After dropping out of school at 14 during the Great Depression, he helped expand his family&#x27;s dairy business into United Dairy Farmers, a large chain of convenience stores. With his three sons, he controlled roughly 42% of American Financial Group, a holding company based in Cincinnati whose primary business is insurance and investments.

Lindner was a part-owner and chief executive officer of the Cincinnati Reds until he sold a majority interest to a group led by Robert Castellini on November 2, 2005, and stepped down as CEO. Lindner remained an active partner in the organization after the transaction. In 1997, Lindner was inducted into Junior Achievement&#x27;s U.S. Business Hall of Fame.

==Philanthropy==
Lindner donated to charitable causes and political campaigns. The Lindner family has supported several Cincinnati private schools, including Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, which was founded by the Lindners. Lindner supports his Carl H. Lindner Business Honors program within the University of Cincinnati&#x27;s College of Business, which was previously called the Carl H. Lindner Honors-PLUS program until it was changed by new leadership in the college of business. His Great American Insurance Company was once the title sponsor of the Cincinnati Masters tennis tournament. Phillips Chapel Church honored Lindner with the addition of the Carl Lindner Jr Fellowship Hall.

Most recently, in June 2011, the University of Cincinnati honored Lindner by renaming the College of Business the Carl H. Lindner College of Business after him in recognition of his and his family&#x27;s contributions to the college, university, and business community.

Although Lindner was a devout Baptist, he was considered as one of the largest non-Jewish donors to the organized Jewish community in the United States. In 1978, he was named the Man of the Year by the United Jewish Appeal, and was later named a recipient of the Tree of Life Award for the Jewish National Fund, and was recognized as the largest non-Jewish purchaser of Israel Bonds. Lindner, who said an early loan from Isaac Wolfson inspired him to never forget his gratitude to the Jewish people, donated to such causes in multiple occasions, including $1 million in a 1991 fundraiser and $5 million in 2004.

In 1978, Lindner was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Republican financial support==
Lindner supported the Republican Party. During the 2004 election, the Lindner family contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Republicans, including the Republican National Committee and several politicians. In 2004, the Republican National Committee named Lindner as one of 62 &quot;Super Rangers&quot;, the highest level of fundraising recognition, accorded to those who raise $300,000 or more. Lindner, an ally of George W. Bush, secured the use of Great American Ball Park for Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign on October 31, 2004, two days before the 2004 Presidential Election.

In 2005, Lindner was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.

== Associations ==
Carl Lindner and his brother Robert used their family&#x27;s dairy business to build a chain of convenience stores in Cincinnati, Ohio, called United Dairy Farmers (UDF). From there they went into the financial and communications fields. Through their holding company American Financial Group (AFG) they control Great American Insurance, a holding company for a group of property and life insurance companies that constitute the twenty-third largest insurer in the country. AFG owned the fourth-largest bank in Cincinnati, Provident Bank, and the second-largest savings and loan (Hunter Savings, later merged into Provident. The Lindners also control seventy shopping centers around Cincinnati. They once owned Bantam Books and the major newspaper of Cincinnati, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. Charles Keating, also of Cincinnati, was a close friend and colleague of the Lindners.

Carl Lindner also had major investments in United Brands (formerly known as United Fruit - Chiquita Bananas which included plantations in El Salvador and other Central American countries.), Gulf+Western (later Paramount Communications, now part of Viacom and CBS Corporation), Warner Communications, Kroger (a major supermarket chain in the eastern U.S.), Great American Broadcasting, General Cable and Penn Central.

Whereas the Lindner companies and financial institutions once operated on conservative, cautious principles they later became involved in riskier ventures. Lindner insurance companies began to invest in junk bonds and other Lindner companies began to issue junk bonds. The SEC noted that Lindner companies were the single largest filers of new issues of securities in the U.S. Lindner was repeatedly accused of self-dealing in the corporations under his control; e.g., having such a corporation give him a private aircraft. He became closely associated with Michael Milken and the others in the junk bond field to the extent that his financial institutions invested in the junk bonds of the others. He and others actively engaged in public relations efforts to present an image of fiscal propriety to the general public.

==Death==

Carl Lindner Jr. died on October 17, 2011, at age 92. He was survived by his wife, the former Edyth Bailey; his sons, Carl III, Craig and Keith; 12 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

<text>[[Count]] Roman Potocki (16 December 1852 – 24 September 1915) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic) and politician.

==Early life==
Count Roman was born on 16 December 1852 at Łańcut in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, in what was then a part of the Austrian Empire. He was a son of Count Alfred Józef Potocki, Minister-President of Austria, and Princess Maria Klementyna Sanguszko. His brother, Count Józef Mikołaj Potocki, married his second wife&#x27;s younger sister, Princess Helena Augusta Radziwiłł.

His paternal grandparents were Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki (the son of writer Jan Potocki, best known for his famous novel &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;) and Princess Józefina Maria Czartoryska. His maternal grandparents were Prince Roman Sanguszko and Countess Natalia Potocka.

==Career==
He ran a family distillery, which is today known as Polmos Łańcut. Following his father&#x27;s death, he became Third Lord Ordynat of Łańcut estates (which his father had inherited from his father).

He was a member of the Polish Circle in the Council of State for Austria-Hungary and served in the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria, was a member of Austrian Imperial Council from 1882 to 1890, and was a Member of the Austrian House of Lords in 1890.

Awarded with the Order of the Golden Fleece.

==Personal life==
On 21 November 1882, he married Countess Izabella Potocka in Warsaw. She was a daughter of Count Stanislaw Potocki and Princess Maria Sapieha-Kodenska. She died in Vienna on 21 March 1883.

On 16 June 1885, he married Princess Elżbieta Matylda Radziwiłł (1861–1950) in Berlin. She was a daughter of Prince Antoni Wilhelm Radziwiłł and Marie de Castellane (the daughter of French aristocrats Henri de Castellane and Pauline de Talleyrand-Périgord). Before their divorce, they had two children:

* Count Alfred Antoni Potocki (1886–1958), who married Izadora Narkiewicz-Jodko, a daughter of Zygmunt Narkiewicz-Jodko and Stanislawa Jordan-Walawska in 1956.
* Count Jerzy Józef Potocki (1889–1961), the Polish ambassador to the United States from 1936 to 1940 who married Susanita Yturregui in 1931.

Count Potocki died in Łańcut on 24 September 1915, in what by then had become Austria-Hungary.

<text>Richard Grant White (May 23, 1822 – April 8, 1885) was one of the foremost literary and musical critics of his day. He was also a prominent Shakespearean scholar, journalist, social critic, and lawyer. He was born and died in New York City.

==Early life==
White was born on May 23, 1822, in New York City to Richard Mansfield White (1797–1849) and Ann Eliza (née Tousey) White (1802–1842). He was eight in descent from John White, a puritan who was one of the founders of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut. His father, a shipping and commission merchant, was from a wealthy old New England family that lived in New York City. The elder White also served as secretary of the Allaire Iron Works company.

His father was the second son of the Rev. Calvin White (b. 1762), who was successively a Congregational, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian minister who became a Roman Catholic in 1821. His grandfather Calvin, who served as rector of Christ’s Church in Middletown, Connecticut, was first married to Phebe Camp and secondly to Jane Mardenbrough.

White prepared for college at Dr. Muhlenberg&#x27;s Institute in Flushing on Long Island and Columbia Grammar School. He attended Bristol College in Pennsylvania from 1835 to 1837, and University of the City of New York (now known as New York University) beginning in 1837 and graduating with A.B. in 1839. He distinguished himself as a scholar of letters and mathematics and was the orator and Grand Marshal at Commencement. He later received a M.A. from New York University as well.

==Career==
He studied medicine, with Dr. Alfred C. Post, and read law, with Judge Woodruff, and was admitted to the Bar in 1845. White, who was brought up as a New Yorker, expected to receive a sizable inheritance from his father. The inheritance never materialized as his father was forced into bankruptcy and died in poverty in 1849 when his business was ruined by the advent of steam-powered shipping.

With no inheritance allowing a life of leisure, White worked as a lawyer and became one of the foremost literary and musical critics of his day. He had a distinguished career in journalism and literature as an editorial writer and musical critic for &quot;The Courier and Enquirer,&quot; continuing when it merged into &quot;The New York World&quot;. He wrote many books and articles for the leading American magazines, and contributed to Appleton&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s Cyclopedias. &quot;Words and Their Uses&quot; was one of his most noted books. White also authored several prominent national hymns. In an editorial in the &quot;New York Times&quot; after his death, it was written:

By the death of Mr. Richard Grant White American literature loses an interesting writer and a variously accomplished man. Mr. White&#x27;s Shakespearean studies are, perhaps, the most satisfactory results of his scholarship; more so, certainly, than his labors in verbal criticism. In these latter an extreme sensitiveness led him to regard every difference of opinion as almost a personal offense, and by reason of this peculiarity of temper his abilities were rated by the reading public less highly than they really deserved.

While White wrote on a wide range of subjects, his essay &quot;The Public-School Failure&quot; from December 1880 established him as a prominent and controversial social critic. His essay prompted several responses, including from the &quot;New York Times,&quot; which wrote in February 1881, &quot;It is a libel, pure and simple, made up of an exaggerated statement of some of the poorest results contained in the report with some touches of false coloring. Mr. White&#x27;s conclusions on the first count are, therefore, vitiated. His argument that the theory of public schools is false is a &#x27;medley of fallacies.&#x27;&quot;

Upon the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War, White became the chief of the United States Revenue-Marine (which later became the United States Coast Guard), an armed customs enforcement service, in New York. He served in this role from 1861 to 1878.

===Shakespeare works===
As one of the most acute students and critics of Shakespeare, White&#x27;s scholarship was recognized and praised by scholars not just in the United States but in England, France, and Germany. He published two editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s works and other works, including &quot;Essay on the Authorship of the Three Parts of Henry VI&quot; (1859), and &quot;Riverside Shakespeare&quot; (1883 and 1901): and &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Scholar&quot;. He also wrote books on subjects, such as &#x27;&quot; and a civil war satire, &quot;The New Gospel of Peace, According to St. Benjamin&quot;. He was a vice-president of the New Shakespeare Society of London, England and edited a twelve-volume edition of Shakespeare from 1857 to 1865.

==Personal life==
On October 16, 1850, he was married to Alexina Black Mease (1830–1921), the daughter of Charles Bruton Mease and Sarah Matilda (née Graham) Mease, a Charleston family who was then living in New York. At the time of their wedding, both the bride and groom were painted by Daniel Huntington. In 1860, they were temporarily living at Ravenswood in Long Island. They had two children:

* Richard Mansfield White (1851–1925), who was named after his father.
* Stanford White (1853–1906), a prominent Beaux-Arts architect and partner in the architectural firm McKim, Mead &amp; White, who designed many houses for the rich as well as numerous public, institutional, and religious buildings. In 1906, he was murdered by millionaire Harry Kendall Thaw over White&#x27;s relationship with Thaw&#x27;s wife, actress Evelyn Nesbit.

White owned a violoncello now part of the collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts.

White died of pneumonia at his home on 330 East 17th Street in New York City on April 5, 1885. After a funeral at St. Mark&#x27;s Church, he was buried at Rosedale Cemetery in Orange, New Jersey.

<text>The Faà di Bruno family is the name of an Italian noble family based in the areas of Asti, Casale, and Alessandria, which provided the Counts (later Marquises) of Bruno. In 1703 the family became additionally counts of Carentino.

== History ==
The family arrived in Casale from Vignale around 1500, in the person of Tommaso Faà, who was secretary to the Senate of Monferrato. The brothers Ardicino and Ortensio acquired the castle of Bruno, near Acqui, and were made joint-lords (&quot;consignori&quot;) of Bruno. Subsequently, prominent members included:
* Giovanni Matteo Faà di Bruno a musician of some importance from Casale who published two books of madrigals as well as vespers, psalms, motets and settings of the Magnificat. He was invested as first Count of Bruno in 1588.
* Camilla Faà di Bruno, (c.1599–1662), a society beauty who was married secretly, briefly and morganatically to Ferdinando I the Gonzaga Duke of Mantua and Monferrato; her memoirs have been described as the first prose autobiography written by an Italian woman.

<text>Valerian (377–457) was bishop of Abbenza in North Africa, probably &quot;Dioecesis Zabensis&quot;.

<text>Gerald J. Ford (born 1944) is an American attorney and businessman.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gerald Ford was raised in Pampa, Texas, and attended Pampa Senior High School. He graduated from Southern Methodist University in the Dallas enclave of University Park, Texas in 1966, where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He received a J.D. from the SMU School of Law in 1969.

===Career===
He is former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Golden State Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco. It was a holding company for the nation&#x27;s second largest thrift institution and California&#x27;s fourth largest bank. In 2002, he sold it to Citigroup for $6 billion. He is currently chairman of the board of Hilltop Holdings, a bank and insurance holding company. He is also the non-executive chairman of the Boards of Directors of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), the world&#x27;s largest publicly traded extractor of copper and gold.

He has also invested in First Acceptance Corporation, Pacific Capital Bancorp (Annual Sales $13 billion), Golden State Bancorp, FSB (federal savings bank that merged with Citigroup in 2002) Rio Hondo Land &amp; Cattle Company (annual sales $1.6 million), Diamond Ford, Dallas (sales: $200 million), Scientific Games Corp., SWS Group (annual sales: $422 million); American Residential Cmnts LLC. His other investments include the auto-finance company AmeriCredit, Pacific Capital Bancorp and 120,000 acres (486 km2) of rangeland in New Mexico.

Ford has a history of buying banks, re-organizing them, and subsequently selling them at a substantial profit, with Golden State Bancorp and then bailed-out Pacific Capital Bancorp, being most notable wins.

In a 2010 interview on entrepreneurship with &quot;Forbes&quot;, he suggested reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;The Financier&quot; by Theodore Dreiser, &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; by Tom Wolfe, Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin and &quot;The Big Short&quot; by Michael Lewis&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
He has been a member of Southern Methodist University&#x27;s board of trustees since 1992. He is chair of the board&#x27;s finance committee and a member of its executive committee, trusteeship committee, committee on athletics and executive committee of the Campaign for SMU. He also currently serves as co-chair of the Dedman College Campaign Committee and on the executive board of Dedman School of Law. He is a former member of the executive boards of Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, Cox School of Business, John Goodwin Tower Center for Political Studies and &quot;Willis M. Tate Distinguished Lecture Series&quot;. He has also served as a regent for the Texas A&amp;M University System. He donated $20 million to build the new football stadium at SMU, named the Gerald J. Ford Stadium. He also donated $10 million to the Weill Cornell Medical College at Cornell University. More recently, Ford played a role in SMU&#x27;s 2024 move from the American Athletic Conference to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He was one of a group of roughly 15 boosters who committed to donating enough to the SMU athletic program to allow the school to forego any ACC media revenue for its first nine years as an ACC member.

===Personal life===
He is married and has six children. His wife, Kelli, is an interior designer. They live in Dallas, and have homes in Manhattan, New York City and The Hamptons, a working ranch in New Mexico, and a thoroughbred farm in Kentucky. In 2012, they sold their Beverly Hills, California property to Byron Allen. As of September 2022, he is worth an estimated US $2.3 billion.

<doc id="1319083" wikidata="Q5301483" url="?curid=1319083" title="Douglas Forrester">
<text>Douglas Robert Forrester (born January 24, 1953) is an American businessman and politician from New Jersey. He was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senator from New Jersey in 2002, and the Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 2005. Forrester was defeated by his two Democratic opponents, Frank Lautenberg and then-U.S. Senator Jon Corzine, respectively. Forrester currently serves as the president of Integrity Health, a health benefits management firm.

==Early life==
Forrester is the youngest of five children. His father never graduated from high school, but worked his way through the ranks at Lockheed Martin, while his mother died when he was four. His father remarried.

Forrester excelled in water polo at high school in Santa Clara, California. He was graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard in 1975, having studied philosophy and government.

Forrester then moved to New Jersey to study at the Princeton Theological Seminary, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in theology and politics. He then married childhood friend Andrea Howard, and moved to West Windsor. Forrester and his wife have three children.

==Career==

===Early career===
Forrester was elected as a township committeeman in West Windsor at age 26, and served as mayor from 1981 to 1982. In the 1980s, Forrester became Assistant State Treasurer in the Kean Administration, and later went on to direct the pension system for state employees. In 1990, Forrester founded BeneCard Services, Inc., a pharmacy benefit management firm that provides prescription drug coverage primarily to public sector entities. In a financial disclosure statement in 2002, Forrester reported his 51 percent share in the company to be worth over $50 million. In 2003, Forrester started Heartland Fidelity with Robert Ullman, his partner in BeneCard.

===2002 Race for U.S. Senate===
Forrester ran for the United States Senate in 2002 with the endorsement of President George W. Bush. Forrester&#x27;s original opponent, Robert Torricelli, abandoned his re-election bid under accusations of accepting improper &quot;gifts&quot;. While he was never prosecuted, Torricelli withdrew after he fell far behind in the polls due to an admonishment by the Senate.

In the case of &quot;The New Jersey Democratic Party v. Samson&quot;, 175 N.J. 178 (2002), Forrester sued to stop Democratic Party efforts to replace Torricelli on the ballot with recently retired former Senator Frank Lautenberg. Forrester argued that the state statute generally forbidding the replacement of a candidate on the ballot within 51 days of an election () should be obeyed because &quot;here, there are really no extraordinary facts&quot; such as &quot;death and incapacitation&quot;. Furthermore, Torricelli was only withdrawing from the race, not his current Senate seat. The Democrats argued that there was still time to notify all the absentee voters and Torricelli had the right to withdraw. The County Clerks agreed that a substitution was logistically possible if it occurred immediately but might cost up to $800,000.

During arguments, the New Jersey Supreme Court justices questioned whether this precedent would be abused in the future. Justice James R. Zazzali asked, &quot;Will there be a parade of candidates removed at the whim of party leaders because the candidate is collapsing?&quot; The justices expressed concern for absentee voters and the public interest in having an optimal choice of candidates.

Ultimately, the justices ruled unanimously to allow the ballot replacement. Peter Verniero, a Republican appointed by Christine Todd Whitman, wrote that the statute in question &quot;does not preclude the possibility of a vacancy occurring within 51 days of the election.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;We see what advantage this has for Mr. Forrester; we fail to see what advantage this has for the people of New Jersey.&quot; In deciding to interpret the deadline as it did, the Court cited &quot;Kilmurray v. Gilbert&quot;, 10 N.J. 435 (1952) and &quot;Catania v. Haberle&quot;, 123 N.J. 438. The Democrats were ordered to cover the extra costs incurred to the state.

Three weeks later, Forrester was defeated by Lautenberg 54-44 percent.

===2005 Race for Governor===

According to the Associated Press, Forrester was being asked to run for governor in autumn 2004. He initially decided to take care of his daughter Briana, who had suffered a brain hemorrhage and been diagnosed with cancer. That November, however, she encouraged him to run. (As of April 2005, her cancer is in remission).

On November 23, 2004, Forrester formally announced his gubernatorial candidacy at Washington Crossing State Park. He announced that he would not accept public funding for his campaign. His primary competitor in the primaries was Bret Schundler, a former gubernatorial candidate and former Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. After vote counting problems in Bergen County, a swing county in the primary election, Forrester broke even as planned with Schundler, giving him a 36-31 percent statewide victory over Schundler, setting Forrester up for his race against Democratic Party candidate and US Senator Jon Corzine.

New Jersey law has prohibited insurance companies, or people with a majority interest in one, from making political donations. Forrester&#x27;s campaign was substantially funded by donations from himself, leading to claims that Forrester was in violation of these regulations. Forrester contended that because Heartland Insurance had been incorporated in Washington, D.C., it was not covered by the restrictions. Acting Banking and Insurance Commissioner Donald Bryan, who had been reappointed by Democratic Governor Jim McGreevey, issued an opinion in August 2005 stating that Forrester had not broken the law.

On November 8, Forrester was defeated by Sen. Jon Corzine 53.5-43 percent.

===Integrity Health===

Forrester currently serves as president of Integrity Health, a health benefits management firm that focuses on early prevention and claims transparency. The firm provides health benefit programs for public and private sector employees, including school districts and municipalities.

Integrity Health uses a program to update members on the status of their health and remind them when it is time to get necessary tests, screenings, and check-ups. The focus on preventive care helps to control costs.

The company proposes to streamline the healthcare billing and claims resolution process, while providing a detailed reporting of how healthcare dollars are spent.

Forrester founded the Princeton, New Jersey firm after his daughter experienced a traumatic brain injury.

<text>German Borisovich Khan (; born 24 October 1961) is a Ukrainian-Israeli-Russian oligarch, billionaire, and businessman. After graduating from university in 1988 he worked in a wholesale business selling consumer items, before setting up his own cooperative. He was then appointed the head of the wholesale trade business Alfa Eco as part of the Alfa Group Consortium, by his college friend Mikhail Fridman. Alfa Group, which he also shares with another fellow billionaire and college peer, Alexei Kuzmichev, is the biggest financial and industrial investment group in Russia.
He became president of Alfa Eco in 1996 and was instrumental in directing the company to focus on export and the oil trade. When Alfa bought Tyumen Oil (TNK) in 1997, he joined the board of directors. He was deputy chairman of TNK Oil Company from 1997 until 2003. In 2003, Khan worked with the other TNK owners to form a 50–50 joint venture with BP, in what was the largest foreign investment in Russia to date, at US$8 billion.

TNK-BP became Russia&#x27;s third largest oil company. In 2013 TNK-BP was sold to Rosneft for US$56 billion, a sale described by &quot;Reuters&quot; as &quot;one of the biggest energy takeovers in history.&quot; Khan joined Mikhail Fridman in establishing LetterOne, based in Luxembourg, for the purpose of investing some of the proceeds from the TNK-BP sale in international projects. LetterOne&#x27;s L1 Energy fund was founded in 2013. Khan has donated funds to non-profits such as the European Jewish Fund, and co-founded and supports the Genesis Philanthropy Group.

==Early life and education==
German Borisovich Khan was born on 24 October 1961 in Kyiv, Ukraine. The son of Ukrainian Jewish parents from Lviv, his father was a metallurgy professor. Khan had a keen interest in sports at a young age, and during high school he developed a long-term interest in boxing, citing the sport as an influence on building confidence and self-discipline. Khan graduated from high school in 1978 and subsequently worked for a year as an apprentice on a shop floor of a factory. He then studied mechanical engineering at the Kyiv-Pedagogical College, graduating in 1982. 1983 he enrolled in the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys (MISIS), where he specialised in the study of steel production. After graduating from college in 1988, Khan operated small businesses such as the clothing cooperative &quot;Alexandrina&quot; he founded with a partner, where he served as deputy chairman and handled supply chain and sales before its sale in 1990.

==Career==

===Alfa-Eco and TNK (1989–1990s)===

After a chance meeting with businessman Mikhail Fridman, who had also been a student at MISIS, Khan was asked to head-up a wholesale trade business Alfa Eco as part of a wider company, Alfa Group Consortium. The company began by buying and selling a range of products including the purchase, upholstery and sale of carpets to domestic and then later, export markets. Khan took on a number of managerial positions within the company as it expanded into new areas, including head of the wholesale trade department, then head of the export department. Currently under the umbrella company Alfa Group Consortium, other divisions now include Alfa Capital Management, Rosvodokanal Group, AlfaStrakhovanie Group and A1 Group. It also holds interests in the telecommunications company Vimpelcom and Russia&#x27;s biggest food retailer, X5 Group.

Khan held a number of managerial positions at Alfa Group starting in 1992. With Alfa-Eco restructured as the trading arm of the Alfa Group, Khan was Alfa-Eco&#x27;s head of trade operations until 1996 and its director of commodity trading from 1995 to 1998. He became president in 1996, where for his two-year tenure he was instrumental in directing the company to focus on export and the oil trade. The company started by purchasing crude, securing contracts with refiners to process it, and then selling the refined product. In 1997, Alfa Group Consortium together with Access Industries and Renova Group acquired the state-owned TNK Oil Company (Tyumen Oil Company). Alfa Group purchased 40% of TNK&#x27;s shares. When Alfa bought Tyumen Oil (TNK), he joined the board and remained involved in M&amp;A deals. Khan was appointed deputy chairman of the management board of TNK in 2000, retaining the role until 2003.

===TNK-BP leadership (2003–2013)===

In 2003, Alfa Group sold exactly half of TNK to BP for US$6.15 billion, in what was the biggest foreign investment in Russia to date equivalent to $8 billion in invested assets. The deal resulted in the formation of the oil company TNK-BP, with half of the joint venture owned by BP, and the other 50 percent owned by the Alfa Group together with billionaire partners Viktor Vekselberg, and Leonard Blavatnik. From 2003 to 2013, Khan was executive director of TNK-BP Management (now called TNK-BP Holding), and a member of the management board. While managing TNK-BP, Khan remained involved with the Alfa Group at large. Alfa Group bought a stake in Turkcell in 2005, and by April 2007, Alfa Group controlled a 43.5% stake in Kyivstar, a Ukrainian telecom company.

During Khan&#x27;s tenure as a TNK-BP executive director, TNK-BP became Russia&#x27;s third largest oil company and globally a top ten private oil producer. Without a majority stakeholder in the company to dictate choices, by 2008, BP executives were in conflict with AAR over TNK-BP&#x27;s strategy to internationalise the business. After several ongoing lawsuits, issues between AAR and BP were compounded in 2010, after Khan and Fridman resisted BP&#x27;s push to do business with the state-owned oil company Rosneft in Russia, contrary to their shareholder agreement. By 2011, Khan&#x27;s net worth was estimated at $9.6 billion, which placed him at 92 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; billionaires list, also ranking him as the thirteenth wealthiest person in Russia. Khan was appointed executive director of TNK-BP Ltd. in January 2011.

===Founding LetterOne and L1 Energy (2013–2015)===
In July 2012, TNK-BP was sold to the state-owned Rosneft for $56 billion, a process which was still underway by early 2013. Reuters described it as &quot;one of the biggest energy takeovers in history,&quot; with the overall deal worth $55 billion. Khan officially left TNK-BP in March 2013 after Alfa Group sold its 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft for $28 billion. Khan earned around $3.3 billion in the deal. Using the $14 billion raised from selling their stakes in TNK-BP, Khan joined Mickhail Fridman in establishing LetterOne (L1), based in Luxembourg, for the purpose of investing the proceeds from the sale of TNK-BP in international projects.

LetterOne&#x27;s L1 Energy was founded in 2013 with Lord Browne, former CEO of BP, James Hackett of Anadarko Petroleum and Andrew Gould of BG joining L1 Energy Advisory Board. The 2014 downturn in the oil industry and the falling ruble value in Russia led to Khan losing about 22% of his estimated value in 2014, or about $2.5 billion in one year. By that point, his overall value was estimated at £6.3 billion. The market afterwards improved, and Alfa Group&#x27;s assets equaled around $40 billion by March 2015. On 2 March 2015 Lord Browne was appointed chairman of L1 Energy. L1 Energy officially launched as a company in May 2015 in the Neue Galerie New York. The company outlined an ambition to acquire and then develop a portfolio of two or three regionally focused platforms around the world. On 7 May 2015 Lord Davies was appointed deputy non-executive chairman of LetterOne, and a week later, former Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt was appointed as the board&#x27;s advisor.

===North Sea assets, L1 divisions (2015–2016)===
On 3 March 2015, L1 Energy purchased 100% of DEA, an international exploration and production company owned by the German utility RWE, for US$7 billion (€5.1 billion). RWE DEA had total natural gas production output of 2.6bn cubic metres in 2013. The deal was approved by Germany and seven other national and supranational authorities, including the European Union and Ukraine. Despite this, the L1 purchase of RWE DEA was opposed by UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey, who &quot;raised concerns&quot; that sanctions might &quot;force L1 Energy to shut down production in the North Sea, imperiling oil supplies&quot; and 5% of Britain&#x27;s North Sea natural gas output.

DEA sold its North Sea oil fields to Ineos, the chemical company owned by Jim Ratcliffe, for an undisclosed sum in October 2015. At the time, the British government assured LetterOne that the forced sale of DEA&#x27;s UK assets was &quot;not a judgement on the suitability of LetterOne’s owners to control these or any other assets in the UK.&quot; On 14 October 2015, LetterOne Group announced that it had agreed a deal to acquire German utility E.ON&#x27;s interests in three producing Norwegian fields, all located in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Norway&#x27;s oil minister supported the deal and said that approval would be handled &quot;in the usual way.&quot; As of 2016, Khan retains positions on the supervisory board at both Alfa Group Consortium and Alfa Group. He is also a director at Alfa Finance Holdings SA, Alfa Bank ABH Holdings S.A., LetterOne Holdings S.A., and the supervisory board of DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG, which was bought by L1 Energy in 2015. He ranked as the 128th richest person in Europe as of March 2016, with an estimated net value of US$8.7 billion.

===Sanctions (2022)===
Khan (along with Fridman and Kuzmichev) was sanctioned by the EU and UK in February and March 2022 as part of an extensive package of sanctions against Russian officials and oligarchs imposed in response to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Khan stepped down from the LetterOne board in March. In April Alfa Bank was hit with sanctions by the U.S. 

==Philanthropy==

Khan is an active supporter of the Life Line charitable programme, which provides medicine and surgery for seriously ill children in Russia. Since its founding in 2008, the program claims that 8334 children have been saved as a result of their work. Khan is a supporter of Jewish initiatives in Russia and elsewhere in Europe. An active member of the Russian Jewish Congress, Khan regularly contributes to the European Jewish Fund, a non-profit organization aimed at developing European Jewry and promoting tolerance and reconciliation. Khan along with Stan Polovets, Mikhail Fridman, Pyotr Aven, and Alexander Knaster founded the Genesis Philanthropy Group in 2011, whose purpose is to develop and enhance Jewish identity among Jews worldwide. In September 2016, it was announced that he was a member of an initiative to create a Holocaust memorial at Babi Yar in Ukraine. The Initiative Group of the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center also included his long-term colleague Fridman.

==Legal==
In May 2017 Khan, along with fellow Alfa-Bank owners Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, filed a defamation lawsuit against &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; for publishing the unverified Steele dossier, which alleges financial ties and collusion between Putin, Trump, and the three bank owners. In October 2017 Khan, Fridman, and Aven also filed a libel suit against the private-investigation firm Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson, who had commissioned former MI6 agent Christopher Steele to compile the dossier, for circulating the dossier among journalists and allowing it to be published. In April 2018 Khan, Fridman, and Aven filed a libel suit against Steele in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, but the suit was dismissed with prejudice the following August.

Khan is one of many Russian &quot;oligarchs&quot; named in the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, CAATSA, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017.

==Personal life==
Khan has both Russian and Israeli citizenship. He and his wife Angelika have five children together, Jakob, Eleanora, Eva and Jake. and live in London and Moscow. In 2010, Khan purchased a home on Eaton Square in London. Khan remains active with sports, for example participating in endurance, off-road, and rally driving competitions. He enjoys hunting and has a collection of sporting guns and rifles. According to WikiLeaks leaked US diplomatic cables, he was alleged in the past by other businesspeople to have carried handguns to business meetings in Russia. Khan also owns a villa in Monte Argentario, a coastal area in Tuscany.

Khan is the father-in-law of Alex van der Zwaan who, on 20 February 2018, pleaded guilty to charges raised by the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Van der Zwaan was charged with lying to the FBI about his contacts with Rick Gates, and pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to investigators. On 3 April 2018, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000.

<text>Julio Mario Santo Domingo Pumarejo (October 16, 1923 – October 7, 2011) was a Colombian-American billionaire businessman, diplomat and patriarch of the Santo Domingo family who lived in New York City. He controlled more than 100 companies in the diversified portfolio of the &quot;Santo Domingo Group.&quot; He was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the wealthiest men in the world, and the second-wealthiest in Colombia, with a fortune of US$8 billion. He was the founder of a philanthropic foundation, named to honor his father, that benefits Colombia&#x27;s social development.

==Early life==
Julio Mario Santo Domingo was born on October 16, 1923, in Panama City, Panama, to Mario Santo Domingo and Beatriz Pumarejo de Vengoechea, the youngest of their four children; his older siblings were Beatriz Alicia, Cecilia, and Luis Felipe. His father was a banker, described as austere and disciplined, who made a fortune buying companies weakened during the Great Depression; his mother, from a rich and influential family, was first cousin of Alfonso López Pumarejo who was twice President of Colombia. He grew up in Barranquilla and later attended the exclusive Gimnasio Moderno in Bogotá, D.C., ultimately culminating his secondary studies at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; he later attended University of Virginia before transferring to Georgetown University, but did not finish his degree.

==Ambassadorship==
On May 26, 1980, President Julio César Turbay Ayala appointed Santo Domingo to be the first Ambassador of Colombia to China. He presented his Letters of Credence to Ulanhu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, in Beijing on February 17, 1981.

==Santo Domingo Group==
The Group has a majority stake in Bavaria Brewery and Valores Bavaria (a holding company for his non-beer interests). In 2005, Bavaria Brewery merged with South African company SABMiller. In this merging, the group acquired 15.1% of SAB Miller, becoming the second-largest shareholder of the second-largest beer company in the world (behind Anheuser-Busch InBev).

<text>The 1930 United States Senate elections occurred in the middle of Republican President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s term. The 32 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. With the Great Depression beginning to take hold, Republican incumbents became unpopular, and Democrats picked up a net of eight seats, erasing the Republican gains from the previous election cycle, however, Republicans retained control of the chamber. This was the first of four consecutive Senate elections during the Depression in which Democrats made enormous gains, achieving a cumulative pick-up of 34 seats.

In Louisiana, Democratic senator-elect Huey Long chose not to take his Senate seat until January 25, 1932, so he could remain as Governor of Louisiana. The Republicans therefore retained the plurality of seats at the beginning of the next Congress (with Vice President Charles Curtis (R) able to cast tie-breaking votes, the Republicans would have majority control).

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements=== 
Four Republicans retired instead of seeking re-election. Two Republicans retired instead of seeking election to finish the unexpired term and instead of seeking election to full term. One Democrat retired instead of seeking election to a full term.

<text>Auchinleck ( ; ; ) is a village southeast of Mauchline, and northwest of Cumnock in East Ayrshire, Scotland.

Surrounding the village is Auchinleck Estate, centred on Auchinleck House, past home of the lawyer, diarist and biographer James Boswell, 9th Laird of Auchinleck.

==History==
Auchinleck is in the heart of the ancient Kyle district of Scotland. The place-name means &quot;field of (flat) stones&quot; in Scottish Gaelic, from &#x27; (&#x27;field&#x27;) and &#x27; (&#x27;slab&#x27;). The small locality of Auchincloich has a comparable meaning.

Although record of a community exists from as early as 1239, reliable records can really only be said to date from the arrival of the Boswell family in 1504. The barony of Auchinleck had been forfeited to the crown and was granted by King James IV to his &quot;good and faithful servant&quot; Thomas Boswell.

The Boswells proved to be assiduous in their estate husbandry, and by the early 1700s a viable village community and a thriving estate had begun to emerge from the surrounding barren moorland. The New Statistical Account of 1837 documents early mining and quarrying in the area which was to become the impetus for the region to boom. By 1881 the parish population had blossomed and was 6,681, four times what it had been in 1831
Nationalisation of coal in 1947 brought investment and with the building of the Barony Power Station, which was commissioned in 1957, the future of the region seemed assured. However, within 30 years the fortunes of the area, so tied to coal, followed the spectacular demise of deep pit mining. Lacking an economic source of fuel as mines closed, the power station shut down in 1989, High House pits closed in 1983, and Auchinleck village subsided into post-industrial recession. However, with the recent acquisition and subsequent development of Dumfries House in the area by Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and with new building taking place in the area there are signs of &#x27;green shoots&#x27;.

==Sport==
The village is home to the junior football club Auchinleck Talbot, who play at the 4,000-capacity Beechwood Park. The &#x27;Bot is one of the most successful clubs in Scotland at their level. They share a fierce rivalry with near neighbours Cumnock Juniors in the West of Scotland Premier Division, the sixth tier of Scottish football.

==Education==

Auchinleck has two primary schools, namely Auchinleck Primary School and St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School. The town&#x27;s secondary school, Auchinleck Academy, closed in late 2020, with pupils moving to the new Robert Burns Academy. This is part of the Barony Campus in Cumnock which has incorporated a number of local schools and nurseries into one site.

==Notable people==

* James Crystal: parish minister for over 50 years and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1879–80
*Kris Doolan: professional footballer for Partick Thistle in the Scottish Championship. Currently one of the club&#x27;s record-breaking goalscorers. Previously played at local club Auchinleck Talbot.
* Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck (1706–1782), judge and father of James Boswell.

<text>Carl Edwin Berg (born 1938) is an American businessman, real estate investor and venture capitalist. He has been included in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 400 richest people in America several times, and in March 2013 his net worth was estimated at $1.1 billion.

==Early life==
Carl Berg was born and raised in New Mexico. He has one brother, Clyde Berg, also a real estate developer.

==Career==
Berg worked as a loan officer in Texas and then moved to California in the 1970s where he took a job running a mortgage company in Sunnyvale. In California, he partnered with real estate agent, John A. Sobrato, and pooling their owned capital, founded Midtown Realty. In 1979, they re-focused their business on building industrial campuses for the tech industry.

==Investments==
Berg acquired Mission West Properties Real Estate Investment Trust in 1997, and sold it to realty developer Divco West in December 2012 for $1.3 billion.

Berg has invested in more than 100 technology startups. He began by investing in companies that were tenants of his Silicon Valley office buildings, occasionally trading office space for company stock. Berg&#x27;s technology investments include the consulting firm International Network Services, which he bought from Lucent Technologies in 2002. He is a major investor in Verifyme, Inc. He is a major investor in Valence Technologies, owning 52% of the company and serving as chairman in 2011. He has also invested in Summit Semiconductor, and is on the board of directors of LynuxWorks.

Berg is also one of the founders of Berg LLC, also known as Berg Health, a biopharma company using AI approaches. In 2014, Berg invested in the development of a new prostate cancer test through BERG LLC.

==Personal life==
Berg is married, with one daughter, and resides in Atherton, California.

In 1982, Berg&#x27;s wife and daughter were kidnapped, escaped unharmed, and the perpetrators were caught.

<text>Charles Cassius Gates Jr. (May 27, 1921 – August 28, 2005) was a businessman and philanthropist. His father, Charles Gates Sr., bought Colorado Tire &amp; Leather for $3,500 in 1911. The company was renamed The [[Gates Rubber Company]] in 1919. It became world&#x27;s largest non-tire rubber manufacturer. Charles Gates Jr. took over in 1961, upon the death of his father. The Gates Corporation continued to grow, diversify, and acquire other companies, including Learjet. By 1996, the privately held Gates Corporation employed over 14,000 people. It was sold to London-based Tomkins plc that year for US$1.1 billion.

Charles C. Gates Jr. was trustee emeritus of the Gates Family Foundation, a large, Colorado-based charitable organization that has distributed over $147 million in grants over its 60-year history. He also sat on the boards of many other organizations, including the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, home to Gates Planetarium. He attended Graland Country Day School, class of 1934, and endowed the school to create an invention competition called the Gates Invention and Innovation Competition. His namesake event has been held annually since 2000.

Charles&#x27; uncle John Gates invented the V-belt in 1917, a staple component in all modern automotive and industrial applications.

<doc id="1319121" wikidata="Q5570356" url="?curid=1319121" title="Global Guardians">
<text>The Global Guardians is a team of DC Comics superheroes whose members hail from countries around the world. The concept originated in the &quot;Super Friends&quot; Saturday morning cartoon, which aired after the comics stories in &quot;Super Friends&quot; #7-9, in which several heroes (Black Vulcan, Samurai, Apache Chief and El Dorado) were added to the Justice League to give it more ethnic diversity.

==Fictional team history==
The characters that would form the Global Guardians first appeared in the &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic book series. They were first introduced in a story (in &quot;Super Friends&quot; #7-9) in which an alien villain called Grax (an old Superman foe) planted bombs on Earth&#x27;s seven continents to destroy it. Thanks to a warning from the Wonder Twins (in their first comic book appearance) the Justice League discovered the plan in time and recruited the heroes of the countries affected to find the bombs before they exploded.

These international heroes would later appear in other issues of &quot;Super Friends&quot;. However, it wasn&#x27;t until &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #46 (June 1982) that they were introduced as a team, in a story in which they helped Superman to stop an evil Atlantean sorcerer named Thaumar Dhai. This is also considered to be these characters&#x27; first canonical appearance in the DC Universe.

After &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths,&quot; it was revealed that the Global Guardians had been gathered together by Doctor Mist to serve as the enforcing arm of an international organization called &quot;The Dome&quot;, which had been created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 to help organize the efforts of superheroes across the globe as an international police organization.

Prior to that, in the early 1950s, several international heroes who had been the beneficiaries of the Justice Society of America&#x27;s kindness during and after World War II, had banded together in an informal &quot;Club of Heroes&quot;. They were integrated in the Global Guardians after its foundation. (Batman&#x27;s butler Alfred Pennyworth sends Christmas cards to the currently surviving members).

This original Global Guardians were based in a United Nations-financed headquarters building also called the Dome located in Paris. The original team was also funded by Doctor Mist and administrated by a woman called Belphegor who was gifted with psychic powers. Many of the Guardians individually assisted other international heroes during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover and once teamed up with Infinity, Inc.

The Guardians eventually lost their UN funding to the Justice League, and the Dome was ordered to close, in part due to the political machinations of their enemy, Dr. Klaus Cornelius. Some of its members left the team to join the League, notably Green Fury and Glacier, formerly known as Icemaiden (who changed their names to Fire and Ice). The others went freelance.

Part of the team was brainwashed by Queen Bee and were directed to battle the Justice League. Fain Y&#x27;onia, an ancient foe of Doctor Mist, killed Bushmaster and Thunderlord and depowered several other members. The surviving Guardians would continue to meet in the Dome&#x27;s Headquarters, which was formerly located in Europe but is now in the Pacific.

In a story in the &quot;JLA Classified&quot; series, some of the Guardians were seen to have joined the Ultramarine Corps.

In 2006, as part of the events of &quot;One Year Later&quot;, in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 4) #10, the Global Guardians are shown regrouped, apparently led by former New Guardian Jet. They attempt to recruit the newest Crimson Fox. When she declines, they say she has no choice. Crimson Fox is later seen publicly voicing the opinions of the Guardians, among them a hatred for Hal Jordan. It is eventually revealed that they are being telepathically controlled by the Faceless Hunter in his attempts to capture Green Lantern. They are defeated and freed from the alien&#x27;s control.

In &quot;World War III&quot;, the Global Guardians assist the Marvel Family in an unsuccessful attack on Black Adam.

In &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot;, Prometheus targets or kills members of the Global Guardians, including Tasmanian Devil, Gloss, Sandstorm, and Freedom Beast.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Wonder Woman considers reestablishing the Global Guardians.

<text>Sid Richardson Bass (born April 9, 1942) is an American billionaire investor and philanthropist.

==Early life and education==
Sid Richardson Bass was born on April 9, 1942. His father, Perry Richardson Bass (died 2006), built an oil fortune with uncle, Sid W. Richardson. He graduated from Yale University in 1965, and also has a degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

==Career==
Bass took control of the family business in 1968. His investments include oil and gas. Along with his father and two of his brothers, he was the largest shareholder in The Walt Disney Company from 1984 until after the stock market crash in 2001. Bass was forced to sell his Disney holdings as a result of a margin call. He turned the $50-million family company he inherited into a $14-billion investment group.

He started to unload his Disney shares four days after September 11. 135 million shares were sold, most of them under market value, making the Disney share drop 8.9%. This quick bulk sale was a Wall Street surprise. Some speculated that Bass owed money as a result of a margin call. Others speculated that the Disney deal slowly fell out of Bass&#x27; control after his main adviser Richard Rainwater had left in 1986. No official reason was communicated.

In 2007, he had a net worth of US$3 billion.

In 2020, he was ranked No.359 in the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America.

==Philanthropy==
Bass donated $20 million to Yale University for the study of humanities in 1990. In 2006, Bass and his second wife, Mercedes Bass, made a gift of $25 million to the Metropolitan Opera, at the time the largest individual gift in the company&#x27;s history.

==Personal life==
His first wife was Anne Hendricks Bass, with whom he had two daughters: author Hyatt Bass and Samantha Bass. He divorced Anne Bass in 1986. In 1988, Bass married the Iranian-American socialite Mercedes Bass, formerly Mercedes Kellogg, née Tavacoli. This childless marriage ended in divorce in 2011.

<text>Robert Martin Friedland (August 18, 1950) is an American-Canadian billionaire financier in the mining industry. Since the early 1980s, he has specialized in securing funding for the exploration and development of mineral and energy resources and technology ventures. He is the founder and chairman of his private, family-owned firm, Ivanhoe Capital Corporation, which is active in capital markets, focused on emerging markets. He is the founder and co-chairman of Ivanhoe Mines, a Canadian public company listed on the Toronto and OTCQX exchanges.

==Early life==
Friedland was born in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest of three children born to immigrant parents Ilona (née Muller) and Albert Friedland. Friedland&#x27;s father survived three years in Auschwitz while his mother worked as a forced laborer during the Holocaust.

===LSD===
Robert Friedland resigned from Bowdoin College in 1970 after being arrested by federal authorities for the possession of an estimated $100,000 worth of LSD. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison, but received early release on probation. The conviction was expunged in 1986.

He graduated in 1974 from Reed College, Oregon, with a political science degree. During his senior year at Reed, Friedland was student body president.

===All One Farm===
During his time at Reed he met Steve Jobs with whom he shared an interest in Eastern spirituality. At the time, Friedland served as the caretaker of an apple farm south of Portland that was owned by his millionaire uncle Marcel Muller and Jobs would come on the weekends and help with the apple orchard, which served as the inspiration for the name of his company, Apple Inc. Friedland turned the orchard into a commune called All One Farm. His followers were not paid for working on commercial endeavors there.

==Career==
Friedland got his start as the CEO of Galactic Resources Ltd. Raising over US$300 million in investments, he established a gold mine at Summitville, Colorado. Against contractor advice, Friedland decided to implement the relatively new mining technology of heap leaching for the site during the middle of a snowy winter. The sodium cyanide solution used to extract ore soon spilled from the mine as the heap-leach liner collapsed. Carried by heavy rain and snow, the cyanide and other heavy metals contaminated the Alamosa River, causing the deaths of fish as far as 17 miles downstream from the mine. The clean-up of the mine cost the EPA over 100 million dollars, and Galactic Resources soon went bankrupt in 1992. Friedland resigned from his positions at Galactic Resources on the day that the EPA issued their notice to Colorado regulators that they were taking action at Summitville. Claiming to have only based his decisions on mining expert advice and having resigned two years before Galactic Resources went bankrupt, Friedland denied responsibility for the environmental damage to Summitville.

Friedland is currently the executive co-chairman of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. (IVN: TSX, IVPAF: OTCQX), a Canadian mining company focused on advancing three joint-venture projects in Southern Africa: copper production from a major new mine at the Kamoa-Kakula copper discoveries near Kolwezi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); mine development at the Platreef palladium-platinum-nickel-copper-rhodium-gold discovery near Mokopane in South Africa; and the extensive redevelopment and upgrading of the historic Kipushi zinc-copper-germanium-silver mine, also in the DRC. Ivanhoe also is exploring for new copper discoveries on its wholly owned Western Foreland exploration licences in the DRC, near the Kamoa-Kakula Project. The current Ivanhoe Mines was launched in 1993 as African Minerals to pursue mineral interests in Southern Africa. It was renamed Ivanplats Limited in 2011, and then Ivanhoe Mines in 2013.

Friedland also operates Ivanhoe Capital from its corporate headquarters in Singaporea location that has facilitated his focus on the Asia Pacific region. Ivanhoe Capital has specialized in the provision of venture capital, project financing and related financial services for a roster of international business enterprises since its founding in 1987.. Mr. Friedland was inducted into the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame in 2016 and into the American Hall of Fame in 2021 for his outstanding lifetime achievements advancing the global mineral resources industry.

Friedland was CEO of the original Ivanhoe Mines (now named Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX &amp; NYSE)), which he founded as Indochina Goldfields in 1994 and led to a successful initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1996. He was chairman, and later executive chairman, until 2011. Exploration by Ivanhoe Mines since 2000 discovered a chain of copper, gold and silver deposits at Oyu Tolgoi (Turquoise Hill) in Mongolia&#x27;s South Gobi region. The first phase of what is independently projected to be one of the world&#x27;s largest porphyry copper and gold mines (Oyu Tolgoi) began commercial production in 2013. The original Ivanhoe Mines was renamed Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX &amp; NYSE) in 2012. Turquoise Hill Resources is focused on the operation and further development of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine.

Friedland was the Chairman of Diamond Fields Resources when it was bought out for $4.3 billion by Michael Sopko&#x27;s INCO for its rich Voisey&#x27;s Bay development. The deal earned Friedland a seat on the board of INCO, from which he benefited by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce&#x27;s 2006 bid for INCO.

Friedland&#x27;s other corporate leadership positions include or have included:
:* Chief Executive Officer of Ivanhoe Capital Acquisition Corp. (IVAN: NYSE)
:* Co-Chairman, of SK Global / Ivanhoe Pictures 
:* Chairman and CEO of High Power Exploration 
:* Chairman, Gold X Mining Corp.(GLDX: CVE)

<doc id="1319161" wikidata="Q4293552" url="?curid=1319161" title="Roger Milliken">
<text>Roger Milliken (October 24, 1915 – December 30, 2010) was an American textile heir, industrialist, businessman, and political activist. He was president and then CEO of his family&#x27;s company, Milliken &amp; Company, from 1947 until 2005. He continued as chairman until his death in 2010. Milliken is known as a political godfather to the American conservative movement.

==Company background==

Deering Milliken Company was co-founded by Roger&#x27;s grandfather, Seth Minot Milliken, and William Deering in 1865. The small woolens fabric company was initially based in Portland, Maine, but moved to New York City in 1868 after William Deering left Deering Milliken to start the Deering Harvester company. Deering Harvester later merged with the McCormick Harvester Company to form International Harvester. There is a surviving spinoff of International Harvester (which is today known as Navistar International). In 1884, Deering Milliken Company invested in its first property near Spartanburg, South Carolina, where the company&#x27;s headquarters have been based since 1958. In 1976, Deering Milliken officially became Milliken &amp; Company.

==Personal life==
Milliken was born October 24, 1915, in New York City, the eldest son of Gerrish Hill Milliken and Agnes Malcolm (née Gayley) Milliken. Roger&#x27;s grandfather was Seth Milliken, co-founder of what is today known as Milliken &amp; Company. He attended Yale University, where he studied French history and graduated in 1937. After graduation, he started out in New York City’s Mercantile Stores, in which his family had an ownership stake. Roger&#x27;s brother Gerrish H. Milliken was married to Phoebe Thayer Milliken née Goodhue, the daughter of the banker F. Abott Goodhue.

In 1941, he was given the stewardship of three small woolen-producing mills in Maine. When his father, Gerrish, died in 1947, the 32-year-old Milliken succeeded him as president. Young Roger Milliken soon became embroiled in one of the ugliest labor disputes in American history. In 1956 Roger Milliken imposed changes in working conditions at the Darlington SC textile mill that were unfavorable to the workers. The workers at the mill — which had been in operation 1883 — felt they were suddenly being treated like slaves. In response the workers voted to negotiate with their employer which was their absolute right under United States labor law. Roger Milliken responded by firing all the workers in violation of federal labor law and closing the mill. The former employees sued to enforce the law. The United States Supreme Court ruled against Milliken in 1965. After delaying 15 more years, in 1980 Milliken and Company settled the matter by paying $5 million dollars to the 439 Darlington workers who were still alive and the heirs of the 114 workers that had died without being paid.

Roger Milliken died on December 30, 2010. Funeral services were held at Church of the Advent and he was buried at Greenlawn Memorial Gardens of Spartanburg.

==Family==
Milliken met his future wife, Justine van Rensselaer Hooper, at a dinner party. They married in 1948 and had five children. Justine died in 2003.

Milliken&#x27;s son Weston is an openly gay man, liberal activist, and member of the Democracy Alliance that is dedicated to advancing the rights of organized labor, people of color, women, and LGBT people in Southern states. Weston&#x27;s activism has been described as &quot;clearly avenging the sins of the father.&quot;

Among Milliken&#x27;s other living relatives is Cody Franchetti, an independent scholar in Rome.

==Activism==

The Milliken family was active in the community, Roger serving on the board of Wofford College and Justine on the board of Converse College. Milliken also served on other corporate and nonprofit boards, including Arthur D. Little, Westinghouse, Citicorp, Mercantile, W.R. Grace, Institute of Textile Technology, The Heritage Foundation, the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport Commission, and the Spartanburg Day School.

Milliken was vehemently Anti-Union, closing the Darlington Manufacturing Company after workers there voted to unionize in 1956.

==Politics==
He was president of Milliken &amp; Company until 1983, when he became chairman and CEO. He relinquished the CEO title in 2005, and remained chairman until his death. Starting in the 1950s, Milliken helped build the South Carolina Republican Party, which had been in the minority for decades. Milliken helped convince South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond to switch to the Republican Party.

Milliken raised the money for the &quot;Senator Thurmond Speaks for Nixon-Agnew&quot; commercials that formed part of Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy of attracting white Southerners to the Republican Party in the 1968 Presidential election. He was a notable donor to conservative causes. He supported &quot;National Review&quot;, the Western Goals Foundation, the John Birch Society, Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and Pat Buchanan, among others.

<text>Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter is the fourth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was released on December 28, 1999, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. According to &quot;USA Today&quot; critic Steve Jones, the record marked a return to the street-oriented sound of Jay-Z&#x27;s 1996 debut album, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;. &quot;Vol. 3...&quot; featured production from Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, K-Rob, DJ Clue, Rockwilder, DJ Premier, and Irv Gotti, among others.

The album was well received by critics and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 462,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold over three million copies and been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;Vol. 3...&quot; was released on December 28, 1999, and sold 462,000 copies in its first week, while debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The sales week was thirty-percent more than the first-week sales of Jay-Z&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life&quot; (1998). On February 14, 2001, it was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2009, the album reached sales of 3,093,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

In a contemporary review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Kris Ex wrote that Jay-Z &quot;has become a better architect of songs&quot; while hailing &quot;Vol. 3...&quot; as &quot;his strongest album to date, with music that&#x27;s filled with catchy hooks, rump-shaking beats and lyrics fueled by Jay&#x27;s hustler&#x27;s vigilance&quot;. Richard Harrington from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the record to be &quot;full of reputation-building swagger, cataloguing of lyrical skills and autobiographical perspective&quot;. Reviewing the album in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Anthony DeCurtis said it reconnects with Jay-Z&#x27;s urban demographic, &quot;with flair&quot;, while Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; was particularly impressed by his lyrics and flow, finding both to be &quot;razor-sharp as ever&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau argued that Jay-Z has too much at stake commercially to depart from &quot;playing the now-a-rapper-now-a-thug &#x27;reality&#x27; game with his customers, thugs and fantasists both&quot;, but he impresses with &quot;a rugged, expansive vigor, nailing both come-fly-with-me cosmopolitanism and the hunger for excitement that&#x27;s turned gangster hangouts into musical hotbeds from Buenos Aires to Kansas City&quot;. Fellow &quot;Voice&quot; critic Miles Marshall Lewis called Jay-Z &quot;the best MC in hip hop&quot; and &quot;Vol. 3…&quot; &quot;the quintessential 2000-model hip hop album&quot;. Soren Baker was less impressed in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, writing that the record lacks the &quot;biting humor and spectacular wordplay&quot; of his previous albums.

In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Jon Caramanica later wrote, &quot;&quot;Life &amp; Times of S. Carter&quot; took [&quot;Vol. 2&quot;″s] combination of style and substance to its apotheosis. In addition to maintaining a strong lyrical presence, Jay also showcased his talents as a master of flow, changing cadences and rhyme patterns with impressive regularity and flexibility ... Nearly every track on this album was sonically unique, and Jay rode each one with aplomb and skill&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush wrote in a retrospective review that a couple of overwrought productions (&quot;Dope Man&quot;, &quot;Things That U Do&quot;) keep it from being among Jay-Z&#x27;s best albums.

<doc id="1319189" wikidata="Q1436786" url="?curid=1319189" title="Figure drawing">
<text>A figure drawing is a drawing of the human form in any of its various shapes and postures, using any of the drawing media. The term can also refer to the act of producing such a drawing. The degree of representation may range from highly detailed, anatomically correct renderings to loose and expressive sketches. A life drawing is a drawing of the human figure, traditionally nude, from observation of a live model. Creating life drawings, or life studies, in a life class, has been a large element in the traditional training of artists in the Western world since the Renaissance.

A figure drawing may be a composed work of art or a figure study done in preparation for a more finished work, such as a painting. Figure drawing is arguably the most difficult subject an artist commonly encounters, and entire courses are dedicated to the subject. The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts, and the human figure can be the basis of portraiture, illustration, sculpture, medical illustration, and other fields.

==Approaches==

Artists take a variety of approaches to drawing the human figure. They may draw from live models or from photographs, from mannequin puppets, or from memory and imagination. Most instruction focuses on the use of models in &quot;life drawing&quot; courses. The use of photographic reference—although common since the development of photography—is often criticized or discouraged for its tendency to produce &quot;flat&quot; images that fail to capture the dynamic aspects of the subject. Drawing from imagination is often lauded for the expressiveness it encourages, and criticized for the inaccuracies introduced by the artist&#x27;s lack of knowledge or limited memory in visualizing the human figure; the experience of the artist with other methods has a large influence on the effectiveness of this approach.

In developing the image, some artists focus on the shapes created by the interplay of light and dark values on the surfaces of the body. Others take an anatomical approach, beginning by approximating the internal skeleton of the figure, overlaying the internal organs and musculature, and covering those shapes with the skin, and finally (if applicable) clothing; the study of human internal anatomy is usually involved in this technique. Another approach is to loosely construct the body out of geometric shapes, e.g., a sphere for the cranium, a cylinder for the torso, etc. Then refine those shapes to more closely resemble the human form.

For those working without visual reference (or as a means of checking one&#x27;s work), proportions commonly recommended in figure drawing are:
* An average person is generally 7-and-a-half heads tall (including the head). This can be illustrated to students in the classroom using paper plates to visually demonstrate the length of their bodies.
* An ideal figure, used for an impression of nobility or grace, is drawn at 8 heads tall.
* A heroic figure used in the depiction of gods and superheroes is eight-and-a-half heads tall. Most of the additional length comes from a bigger chest and longer legs.
These proportions are most useful for a standing model. Poses which introduce foreshortening of various body parts will cause them to differ.

==Media==
The French Salon in the 19th century recommended the use of Conté crayons, which are sticks of wax, oil and pigment, combined with specially formulated paper. Erasure was not permitted; instead, the artist was expected to describe the figure in light strokes before making darker, more visible marks.

A popular modern technique is the use of a charcoal stick, prepared from special vines, and a rougher form of paper. The charcoal adheres loosely to the paper, allowing very easy erasure, but the final drawing can be preserved using a spray-on &quot;fixative&quot; to keep the charcoal from rubbing off. Harder compressed charcoal can produce a more deliberate and precise effect, and graduated tones can be produced by smudging with the fingers or with a cylindrical paper tool called a stump.

A graphite pencil is also commonly used for figure drawing. For this purpose, artists&#x27; pencils are sold in various formulations, ranging from 9B (very soft) to 1B (medium soft), and from 1H (medium hard) to 9H (very hard). Like charcoal, it can be erased and manipulated using a stump.

Ink is another popular medium. The artist will often start with a graphite pencil to sketch or outline the drawing, then the final line work with a pen or brush, and permanent ink. The ink may be diluted with water to produce gradations, a technique called ink wash. The pencil marks may be erased after the ink is applied, or left in place with the dark inks overpowering them.

Some artists draw directly in ink without the preparation of a pencil sketch, preferring the spontaneity of this approach despite the fact that it limits the ability to correct mistakes. Matisse is an artist known to have worked in this way.

A favored method of Watteau and other 17th and 18th-century artists of the Baroque and Rococo eras was to start with a colored ground of tone halfway between white and black, and to add shade in black and highlights in white, using pen and ink or &quot;crayon&quot;.

==History==
The human figure has been the subject of drawings since prehistoric times. While the studio practices of the artists of antiquity are largely a matter of conjecture, that they often drew and modeled from nude models is suggested by the anatomical sophistication of their works. An anecdote related by Pliny describes how Zeuxis reviewed the young women of Agrigentum naked before selecting five whose features he would combine in order to paint an ideal image. The use of nude models in the medieval artist&#x27;s workshop is implied in the writings of Cennino Cennini, and a manuscript of Villard de Honnecourt confirms that sketching from life was an established practice in the 13th century. The Carracci, who opened their &quot;Accademia degli Incamminati&quot; in Bologna in the 1580s, set the pattern for later art schools by making life drawing the central discipline. The course of training began with the copying of engravings, then proceeded to drawing from plaster casts, after which the students were trained in drawing from a live model.

In the late 18th century, students in Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s studio followed a rigorous program of instruction. Mastery in drawing was considered a prerequisite to painting. For about six hours each day, students drew from a model who remained in the same pose for one week. &quot;Eighteenth-century drawings, like that attributed to Jacques-Louis David, were usually executed on tinted paper in red or black chalk with white highlights and a darkened ground. The models&#x27; poses tended to be active: standing figures seem about to stir and even seated figures gesticulate dramatically. Close observation of the model&#x27;s body was secondary to the rendering of his gesture, and many drawings - consistent with academic theory - seem to present a representative figure rather than a specific body or face. In comparison, academies produced in the nineteenth century [...] were typically executed in black chalk or charcoal on white paper and are meticulous depictions of the particularities and idiosyncrasies of the body of the live model. Evidence of the artist&#x27;s hand is minimized and, although reclining or seated poses are rare, even standing poses are comparatively static...&quot; Before the late 19th century, women were generally not admitted to figure drawing classes.

===Academy figure===

An academy figure is a carefully executed drawing or painting of the nude human body, typically at half life size, completed as an exercise in an art school or academy.

===Women artists===
Historical accounts reveal that nude models for aspiring female artists were largely unavailable. Women were barred from certain institutions because it was considered improper and possibly even dangerous for them to study from nude models. Though men were given access to both male and female nudes, women were confined to learning anatomy from casts and models. It was not until 1893 that female students were allowed access to life drawing at the Royal Academy in London, and even then the model was required to be partially draped.

The limited access to nude figures impeded the careers and development of female artists. The most prestigious forms of painting required in-depth knowledge of anatomy that was systematically denied to women, who were thereby relegated to less-regarded forms of painting such as genre, still life, landscape, and portraiture. In Linda Nochlin’s essay, &quot;Why have There Been No Great Women Artists&quot; she identifies the restricted access that women had to nude figure drawing as a historically significant barrier to women&#x27;s artistic development.

==Contemporary studio instruction==
Figure drawing instruction is an element of most fine art and illustration programs. Academies of fine art in Italy have a scuola libera del nudo (&quot;free school of the nude&quot;) which forms part of the degree program but is also open to outside students. In a typical figure drawing studio classroom, the students sit around a model either in a semicircle or a full circle. No two students have exactly the same view, thus their drawing will reflect the perspective of the artist&#x27;s unique location relative to the model. The model often poses on a stand, to enable students to more easily find an unobstructed view. Depending on the type of pose, furniture and/or props may be used. These are typically included in the drawing, to the extent that they are visible to the artist. However, backgrounds are commonly ignored unless the objective is to learn about placement of figures in an environment. Individual models are most common, but multiple models may be used in more advanced classes. Many studios are equipped to allow a variety of lighting arrangements.

When taught at the college level, figure drawing models are often (but not always) nude (aside from small jewelry, props or other inconspicuous items). While posing, the model is usually requested to remain perfectly still. Because of the difficulty of doing this for an extended period of time, periodic breaks for the model to rest and/or stretch are usually included in longer sessions and for more difficult poses.

At the beginning of a figure drawing session, the model is often requested to make a series of brief poses in rapid succession. These are called gesture poses, and are typically one to three minutes each. Gesture drawing is a warm-up exercise for many artists, although some artists sketch out the gesture as the first step in every figure drawing. These broad strokes are not just done by the flick of a wrist, but by using the whole arm to capture the motion of the model. It also helps to keep the artist focused on the model instead of the paper. When it comes to the human body, artists are painfully critical; the proportions of a still life do not have to be drawn perfectly to look authentic, but even the slightest error in human proportions will be easily detected.

Modern and contemporary artists may choose to exaggerate or distort proportions to emphasise the gesture or perceived mood of the models&#x27; pose. The outcomes can be regarded as a finished artwork, expressing both the subject, the observational, emotional and mark making response to the artists figure drawing experience.

Anatomy is only the first level of concern in life classes. Figure-ground relationships and other aspects of composition are also considered. Balance of a composition becomes more crucial and therefore more understood through life drawing. The artist&#x27;s kinesthetic response to the pose and how this is conveyed through a choice of art media is a more advanced concern.
Since the purpose of figure drawing classes is to learn how to draw humans of all kinds, male and female models of all ages, shapes, and ethnicities are usually sought, rather than selecting only beautiful models or those with &quot;ideal&quot; figures. Some instructors specifically seek to avoid the sort of models preferred by fashion photographers, seeking more &quot;realistic&quot; examples and to avoid any implication of sexual objectification. Instructors may also favor models of particular body types based on the unique contours or surface textures they provide. The variety of models hired may be limited by the need for them to hold a pose for extended periods (eliminating restless children and frail older persons), and concerns of modesty and legality when models pose nude (restricting the use of minors).

<doc id="1319196" wikidata="Q1727987" url="?curid=1319196" title="List of Swedish billionaires by net worth">
<text>This is a ranking of Swedish billionaires. The following list is based on the annual estimated wealth and assets assessment compiled and published by American business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot;. The wealth of 45 people exceeds $1 billion.

==Methodology==
To assess and compile data on estimated wealth and assets, &quot;Forbes&quot; relies on information gathered by more than 50 reporters working in 16 countries throughout the year. The reporters arrange interviews with the candidates, interview the employees, attorneys, and securities analysts, and keep track of candidates&#x27; deals. The net worth is estimated based on individuals&#x27; assets, such as stakes in public and private companies, yachts, art, and real estate. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual&#x27;s holdings. Positions in a publicly-traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. For example, the 2022 ranking relies on the stock prices and exchange rates as of March 11, 2022. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual&#x27;s estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual&#x27;s true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.

The Forbes policy is not to list multigenerational families who share fortunes. Still, in some cases, it lists couples and/or siblings together if the ownership breakdown among them is not clear. However, an estimated net worth of $1 billion should be calculated per person. If the wealth could be traced to one living individual, the Forbes includes wealth belonging to a member&#x27;s immediate relatives. Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from the rankings.

== 2022 list==
The forty-five entrepreneurs billionaires are listed as follows, including their Sweden rank (S#) and world rank (W#), citizenship, age, net worth, and source of wealth:

<text>Orchard Beach (sometimes called the Bronx Riviera) is the only public beach in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The , beach is part of Pelham Bay Park and is situated on the western end of Long Island Sound. The beach consists of a 13-section sandy shorefront, a hexagonal-block promenade, and a central pavilion with food stores and specialty shops. The recreational facilities include two playgrounds, two picnic areas, a large parking lot, and 26 courts for basketball, volleyball, and handball. It is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

Orchard Beach was built as part of Pelham Bay Park and was originally located on the eastern shore of Rodman&#x27;s Neck peninsula. In the 1930s, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses announced a project to expand Orchard Beach northward by connecting several islands in Pelham Bay Park via landfill. The expanded beach was dedicated in 1936 and opened in 1937, along with its pavilion and concession stands. Renovations to the beachfront were made in subsequent years. Sand was restored to the beach in 1964 and again in 1995. The promenade and bathhouse were designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006.

==Description==

Orchard Beach is in the eastern section of Pelham Bay Park in the northeastern Bronx and is the Bronx&#x27;s only public beach. An icon of the Bronx, Orchard Beach is sometimes called the Bronx Riviera or Hood Beach. The , beach faces the Long Island Sound and is laid out in a crescent shape with a width of during high tide. The modern beach was designed by Aymar Embury II, working with consulting landscape architects Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano.

Orchard Beach contains a , center mall connecting the bathhouses and boating lagoon. At the time of opening, there were also nine baseball diamonds, seven football fields, 32 tennis courts, a children&#x27;s playground, and a field house. When the beach opened it contained a pavilion with two bathhouses, as well as a cafeteria, a small-boat lagoon, a 5,400-person locker and dressing facility, and two parking lots with a collective 8,000 spots. The beach could host up to 100,000 bathers simultaneously; the bathhouses alone could fit six or seven thousand bathers. The modern beach contains the Orchard Beach Nature Center, as well as two playgrounds, some basketball courts, some handball courts, and three tennis courts.

South of the beach is a meadow that hosts the only known population of the moth species &quot;Amphipoea erepta ryensis&quot;. Another population formerly existed in Rye, Westchester County.

===Bathhouse===
The bathhouse, designed by Embury, is composed of a raised plaza flanked by two pavilions to the north and south. From the mall on the west, a broad staircase rises to the raised plaza. The raised plaza contains bluestone tile pavements. The center of the plaza originally had a large fountain, which was removed in 1941 and replaced with a compass made of granite, bluestone, and slate. At the eastern end of the plaza is a curving concrete wall, with two staircases to the north and south, which lead to a lower terrace and the beachfront promenade. The staircases contain granite steps and concrete balustrades. The lower terrace, east of the pavilions, had trees as well as a dance floor and a bandstand that were later removed. The lower terrace level contains concession windows beneath the curved wall of the raised plaza.
The pavilions are made mostly in red brick and concrete, with various details made of stone, terracotta, and metal. The ground story of each pavilion is at the level of the beach, while the second story is at the same level as the raised entry plaza. Each pavilion has a rectangular, concrete waiting structure facing the entry plaza. There are tall openings on all sides of each waiting structure, with metal grilles in the upper portions of each opening. Inside each pavilion are terrazzo floors. The viewing balconies originally contained brass lighting, benches, and telephone booths. There are blue and white tiles inside the pavilions; the lowest of each pavilion&#x27;s walls are clad with blue tiles. The remainders of the walls, as well as the ceilings, are made of concrete.

The waiting structures connect to outdoor concourses that slope down toward the former locker rooms. Adjacent to each concourse are one-story concrete buildings, which originally distributed towels, bathing suits, and other swim gear. The concessions windows of these one-story structures contain several metal roll-down gates as well as steel canopies. At the end of each concourse, there is a freestanding brick barrier with a semicircular niche that originally housed a fountain. Access to the locker rooms was through either side of each brick barrier. The locker wings contain brick walls and also contain exits facing the promenade to the east.

East of the waiting structures and locker areas, each pavilion contains curved loggias facing the beach to the east. The loggias are supported by square concrete columns supporting concrete friezes. The friezes carry a Greek fret motif. Inside each loggia are viewing balconies with terrazzo floors and ornamental iron handrails. These viewing balconies contain blue-tiled walls, similar to those in the waiting structures, although these walls contain portholes at regular intervals. Spiral stairs from the viewing balconies lead down to the beach levels. The ground levels of the curved loggias are made of brick segmental arches.

===Promenade===
For its entire length, the beach is also fronted by a promenade with hexagonal gray tiles. Four brick utility buildings were built along the promenade: two each to the north and south of the bathhouse pavilion. The utility buildings are set back from the promenade. There are metal railings, cast-iron lampposts, concrete water fountains, and benches along the promenade&#x27;s length. Polygonal-shaped platforms are at each end of the promenade. At the north end of the promenade is a fence that separates the promenade&#x27;s end from a rock shelf. The shoreline then curves north, following the old boundary of the former Twin Islands.

==History==

=== Creation ===

The New York City government acquired the land for Pelham Bay Park in 1887, and the park was officially established in 1888. In early 1902, in order to accommodate vacationers, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation removed two former houses in Pelham Bay Park and used the remaining wood to build free bathhouses, which were used by about 700 bathers per day during that summer. Around 1903, the nearby Hunter Island became a popular summer vacation destination. 

Due to overcrowding on Hunter Island, NYC Parks opened a campsite in 1905 at Rodman&#x27;s Neck southwest of the island, with 100 bathhouses. At the time, Orchard Beach was a tiny recreational area on the northeast tip of Rodman&#x27;s Neck. Orchard Beach was extended by that year, doubling capacity, and a &quot;comfort station&quot; or restroom was added. By 1912, Orchard Beach saw an average of 2,000 visitors on summer weekdays and 5,000 visitors on summer weekends. The beach was a popular destination for summer vacationers.

===Robert Moses expansion===
The current Orchard Beach recreational area was created through the efforts of Robert Moses in 1934, and was built along with the Split Rock golf course. Fiorello La Guardia had become the mayor of New York City and named Moses as the city&#x27;s Parks Commissioner. Immediately after his position was announced, Moses ordered engineers to inventory every park in the city to see what needed renovating. He devised plans for a new Orchard Beach recreation area after he saw the popularity of the Hunter Island campsite. At the time, the beach was a narrow sand bar connecting Hunter Island and Rodman&#x27;s Neck. There was a retaining wall behind the sand bar, and breakwaters allowed water from the Long Island Sound to pass through the sand bar. The retaining wall frequently flooded at high tide, which made the sand bar effectively unusable most of the time. There were approximately 600 families using the bungalows near the sand bar, as well as bathhouses made of granite pavers.

On February 28, 1934, Moses announced a plan for an upgraded beach at Pelham Bay, which had been inspired by the design of Jones Beach on Long Island. The beach would be reconstructed through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) under the 1930s New Deal program, along with another project to construct the nearby Pelham Bay Golf Course. Moses canceled 625 camping leases in March 1934 so the beach could be built on the land. Most of the campers were connected to the Tammany Hall political structure that had ruled the city at one point. Campers protested to the mayor but to no avail. Campers subsequently filed a lawsuit against the city, which concerned Moses&#x27;s right to cancel the leases. The courts ruled in favor of the city in May 1934, and the site was cleared of campers in June.

To make the beach longer and more perfectly crescent-shaped, Moses decided that Hunter Island and the Twin Islands be connected to Rodman&#x27;s Neck by filling in most of LeRoy&#x27;s Bay, located west of Hunter Island. The deteriorated Hunter Mansion was demolished with the construction of the beach. The beach project involved filling in approximately of LeRoy&#x27;s and Pelham Bays with landfill, followed by a total of of sand brought by barge from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. Moses had originally wanted to use sand for the new land, but thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper to use, so the material of choice was switched to landfill. Work on placing the fill began in early 1935, but officials opposed the use of garbage to fill in the land. The landfill was placed among Rodman&#x27;s Neck, the Twin Islands, and Hunter Island. After the garbage began washing onto the beach through the as-yet-incomplete seawall, work on the filling operation was halted. The board allocated $500,000 () for of sand, and the rest of the land reclamation project was done using sand from Sandy Hook and the Rockaways. The sand-filling operations officially began in April 1936. Two seawalls were built: one made of boulders on the east side of the fill facing Pelham Bay, and a smaller wall on the west side facing LeRoy&#x27;s Bay, now a lagoon. The fill was then landscaped with flowers, shrubs, and various genera of trees, while the naturally planted chestnut, oak, hickory, black locust, and black cherry trees on either side of the fill were kept as is.

The beach was dedicated in July 1936 despite only being partially complete. The dedication attracted an estimated 18,000 beach-goers. Orchard Beach was set to open along with the upgraded Jacob Riis Park in Queens on June 19, 1937, but the openings were pushed back due to unfinished work. Both beaches were opened on June 25, 1937, the day after the opening of the Crotona Park Play Center. The opening was marked by a fireworks display that drew 15,000 spectators. The bathhouse pavilion at Pelham Bay Park also opened that year. Orchard Beach was completed in 1938. Later that year, the bathhouse and beach were damaged by a hurricane. Sewage from nearby City Island also seeped onto the beach, and Moses was threatening to close the beach until the city agreed to build a new sewage pipe for the island.

===Later changes===

==== 20th century ====
In 1939, one year after the beach was completed, there were plans to expand the beach. The southern locker room was the first to be renovated, with a extension in 1939. Work was halted from 1941 to 1945 due to World War II. The water between Hunter and Twin Islands was filled in during 1946 and 1947, with new jetties at each end of the beach. The promenade was extended over the fill, gaining its current hexagonal tiles as well as refurbished concession buildings. The extension, opened in May 1947, consisted of of new land and of restored beach. Further improvements were made to the bathhouse pavilion in 1952 and to the northern jetty in 1955. Some ticket windows were installed in 1958, and a new concession stand was added north of the pavilion in 1962. The beach was renovated starting in 1964.

A proposal for a 3,300-seat outdoor theater at Pelham Bay Park, replacing Orchard Beach&#x27;s northern locker facility, was canceled in 1974 due to community opposition. In 1980, NYC Parks proposed a renovation of the beach for its 50th anniversary. By then, the beach had become so rundown that there was garbage covering much of the sand, and there were prostitutes and gamblers along the promenade. The $1 million renovation of the pavilions () was completed by 1986. After the renovation, the pavilions contained some shops and fast food, with a nature center and museum planned for the buildings. In 1985, parts of Orchard Beach, as well as three other city beaches and Central Park&#x27;s Sheep Meadow, were designated as &quot;quiet zones&quot; where loud radio-playing was prohibited.

A second renovation of Orchard Beach started in 1995, with a new sand-filling project to replace the sand that had been lost since the last such project in 1964. Gandhi Engineering oversaw the restoration of the pavilion. Around the same time, a proposal for a water park at Orchard Beach was revealed as part of a plan to bring visitors back to the beach. That proposal was effectively canceled in 1999 due to large opposition from City Island residents. 

==== 21st century ====
In the mid-2000s, as part of the city&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, several facilities in Pelham Bay Park were proposed for upgrades. The city had planned to renovate the beach&#x27;s pavilion at a cost of $23 million, with the south wing being used for fencing and the north wing for swimming and water polo. Both the pavilions and the beach were designated as landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006. The deteriorating eastern bathhouse pavilion, which had been neglected since the 1970s, was closed in 2007 and fenced off in 2009. The similarly sized west bathhouse started undergoing $7 million in repairs. In 2010, construction began on extending the jetty at Orchard Beach. Approximately of sand were pumped onto the beach to replace sand lost over the years. The jetty project cost $13 million, of which the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) paid $7 million and NYC Parks paid $6 million. 

Proposals to renovate Orchard Beach&#x27;s bathhouse pavilions surfaced in the late 2010s, and some funding was provided starting in 2016; The next year, $50 million had been procured to fund the full renovation of the pavilion; by January 2019, there was $75 million available for the renovation. In mid-2020, a drive-in movie theater was set up at Orchard Beach&#x27;s parking lot. Plans for the renovation had been paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Marvel Architects resumed planning for the renovation in May 2021. The work includes new ramps and concessions and was to be finished in 2023 or 2024. Following an influx of asylum seekers to New York City in mid-2022, city officials announced that September that they would construct temporary housing for asylum seekers within Orchard Beach&#x27;s parking lot. After the parking lot flooded during a minor rainstorm that October, the migrant center was relocated to Randalls Island.

==Transportation==

MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27;s Bx12 bus serves Orchard Beach during summer weekends. The Bx29 bus to City Island runs nearby year-round. The New York City Subway&#x27;s Pelham Bay Park station, serving the , is across the Hutchinson River.

<doc id="1319207" wikidata="Q512624" url="?curid=1319207" title="Loopz">
<text>Loopz is a puzzle video game designed and programmed by Ian Upton for the Atari ST in 1989. He previously worked as head game designer for Audiogenic, who acquired exclusive rights to the game, then in 1990 arranged for Mindscape to publish it for computers in North America and consoles worldwide.

The Nintendo Entertainment System version (programmed by Bits Studios) and the Game Boy version (programmed by Argonaut Software) were released in 1990. Audiogenic published versions of the original game for the Acorn Archimedes, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga, and IBM PC in 1990 and 1991.

==Gameplay==

The main focus is on the playing board where random pieces of different shapes are presented to the player. A shape is either a single square containing a straight line or 90° corner or a combination of multiple such squares. The player must then try to make loops out of them. Once a loop is completed, all pieces involved will disappear. (You cannot make any line overlapping the edge, in other words, it cannot be placed in this way)

There exist three different play modes, two of which can be played with two players. The third mode of play starts with a loop already created and then takes away random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in after they show up.

== Reception ==

Richard Leadbetter of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the game 79% for its Amiga version describing its gameplay as simplistic but decent, while noted that graphics looked dated. The Atari ST version received the same score. Steve Cooke of &quot;ACE&quot; magazine rated the Atari ST version 795/1000 noting its difficulty and longer learning curve compared to its peers.
 Stephan Englhart of &quot;Video Games&quot; gave the game&#x27;s Game Boy version 69% and noted that it didn&#x27;t stand out among its peers. Martin Gaksch gave the NES version 69% as well calling the idea innovative, but not well executed.

==Legacy==

A port was done for the Atari Lynx, also for Audiogenic by Hand Made Software but lay unreleased until picked up by Songbird Productions in 2004.

An agreement was reached between Audiogenic Software and the defunct Atari Classics Programmer&#x27;s Club in 1995 for creating a version of the game for Atari 8-bit computers. Development was abandoned in October 1998.

A sequel, &quot;Super Loopz&quot;, was published for the Super NES by Imagineer and for the Amiga CD32 by Audiogenic.

Audiogenic licensed the &quot;Loopz&quot; concept to Capcom who developed a prototype coin-op, but it was never released. Similarly Audiogenic developed an SWP (skill-with-prizes) version on behalf of Barcrest, a leading UK manufacturer of pub games, and this too remains unreleased.

<text>Island Bay is a coastal suburb of Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, situated south of the city centre.

Island Bay lies on the bay which shares its name, one of numerous small bays off Cook Strait and west of Lyall Bay. 500m offshore in Island Bay lies Tapu Te Ranga Island, which forms a natural breakwater and provides a sheltered anchorage for local fishing boats.

Noted current Island Bay residents include former Minister of Justice Andrew Little MP. Former residents include former Mayor Celia Wade-Brown, the late Bruce Stewart, writer and dramatist at Tapu Te Ranga Marae; Middlesbrough F.C. and All Whites striker Chris Killen; artist John Drawbridge; poet Alan Brunton; writer Robin Hyde; and, in the late 19th century, The Hermit of Island Bay.

==History==
Tapu te Ranga Island is said to be Patawa, a point from which the legendary Māori chief Kupe sighted the giant octopus Te Wheke-a-Muturangi, which he pursued across Cook Strait. In pre-European times, Island Bay was home to several pa, including Te Mupunga Kainga, today represented with a pou in Shorland Park. A succession of iwi occupied Island Bay, including Ngai Tara and Ngati Ira.

A famous battle which took place on the beach of Island Bay has been well documented by Elsdon Best. A raiding taua (war party) from Muau-poko were making their way to the Ngai Tara stronghold of Te Whetu-Kairangi, a fortified pa on what is now Miramar peninsula (but was then an island). In the morning, Ngai Tara warriors came down from Uruhau fort (modern day Southgate) and engaged Muau-poko in battle on the beach. Two Muau-poko chiefs were killed, and later cremated in Haewai (Houghton Bay). This battle is commemorated with a pou on the zig-zag leading from Liffey Street to Orchy Crescent.

During a battle in which Ngati Mutunga drove Ngati Ira from Wellington in 1827, Tamairangi, the wife of the Ngati Ira chief, is said to have sought refuge on Tapu te Ranga Island with her children, fleeing by canoe when Tapu te Ranga Island was besieged. In Treaty of Waitangi settlements, both Te Atiawa and Ngati Toa have claimed tangata whenua status over Tapu te Ranga Island. Ngati Toa&#x27;s case was proven in the Māori Land Court.

In the early days of European settlement George Hunter was the chief proprietor of the Island Bay Estate, where he bred stock on his stud farm. The Island Bay portion was subdivided and auctioned in March 1879. In the late 19th century, Island Bay was settled by Italian and Shetlander fishermen. In 1905, Wellington&#x27;s tramline was extended to Island Bay, increasing the area&#x27;s popularity, and steadily transforming it into a seaside suburb. Many Island Bay villas, bungalows and shops date from the 1920s, a period of rapid development for the area. This included the Island Bay Racecourse which was approximately 2km running down Clyde and Derwent Streets, and bounded by Medway and Humber Streets encompassing parts of Mersey Street and Thames Street. Many streets in Island Bay were named after British and European rivers.

In 2016, a cycle way was built along The Parade resulting in considerable controversy within the Island Bay community. 

==Notable features==

=== Erskine College and Chapel ===
Designed by John Sydney Swan and built in 1904–1906, the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic girls&#x27; boarding school, was renamed Erskine College in the late 1960s after the former Superior General Mother Janet Erskine Stuart. The adjacent Erskine Chapel of the Sacred Heart, also designed by John Sydney Swan, was built in 1930 in the French Gothic style. Erskine Chapel is considered to have one of the finest chapel interiors in New Zealand, and is listed as Category I by Heritage New Zealand. The school closed in 1985 and the complex is privately owned. Erskine College was used as a location in Peter Jackson&#x27;s 1996 film The Frighteners. The chapel was refurbished in 2003, and is a popular venue for weddings and concerts.

===Island Bay Marine Education Centre===
The Island Bay Marine Education Centre on the foreshore has a small aquarium and touch tank, and is open to the public on Sundays.

===Churches===
There are five churches in Island Bay. The oldest is St Hilda&#x27;s Anglican church, which is over 100 years old. It had a traditional brick front design, and some stained glass windows honouring the early settlers but the parish was required by Wellington City council to address the building&#x27;s vulnerability to earthquakes. The upgrade project saw the removal of all the brickwork which was replaced by a timber-frame, with floor to ceiling glass facing onto The Parade. The strengthened building re-opened on 27 November 2022. The church is named after St Hilda of Whitby, as the early settlers felt the coastline resembled Northumbria. The Baptist, Catholic, Serbian Orthodox and Presbyterian churches were established more recently. The church facilities are used by a range of community groups.

===Scuba diving and snorkeling===
Two diving companies operate in Island Bay, and offer trips within the local Taputeranga Marine Reserve and to the wreck of HMNZS Wellington, a decommissioned Royal New Zealand Navy frigate which was sunk off the coast of Island Bay in November 2005 to create an artificial reef.

A snorkel trail is located on the eastern side of the bay and offers opportunities to see local fish and marine life.

===Oku Street Reserve===

Oku Street Reserve is a park situated on a promontory between Island Bay and Owhiro Bay.

===Shorland Park===
Shorland Park is a small public park at Island Bay Beach. The playground was extensively upgraded in 2021 and 2022, reopening on 4 March 2022.

Shorland Park contains a band rotunda built in 1930. Plaques record the 152 local soldiers who died in World War I and World War II, and the loss of American submarines and their crew in the Pacific. In the 1930s, local brass bands and the Salvation Army frequently played in the rotunda. The rotunda is now used for occasional concerts, notably during the annual Island Bay Festival.

===Tapu Te Ranga Marae===
Situated in of replanted native forest on a hill near Rhine Street, Tapu Te Ranga Marae was a living marae and the home of Bruce Stewart. The wooden house extended over ten levels, and was built with recycled materials.

The marae was built by Stewart over a few years between 1977 and 1983. At 12:30am on 9 June 2019, the marae suffered a devastating fire and was subsequently destroyed. There are plans to rebuild the marae in the same site.

===Taputeranga Marine Reserve===
The waters surrounding Island Bay have been under the protection of the Department of Conservation since the creation of the 854 hectare Taputeranga Marine Reserve in 2006. The reserve is home to kelp forests, octopuses, blue cod and banded wrasse. Dolphins and whales also frequent the area. A 200m &#x27;snorkel trail&#x27; within the reserve starts and finishes in Island Bay.

===Tapu Te Ranga Motu (the Island)===
Tapu Te Ranga Motu, the island in the middle of the bay, once served as a refuge for local Māori. Tamairanga, the wife of the Ngati Ira chief Whanake, escaped to the island with her children during a battle that forced the tribe from Wellington Harbour.

===Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory===
Victoria University of Wellington maintains the Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory, an active research and teaching presence on Wellington&#x27;s south coast. The Laboratory overlooks the spectacular exposed rocky reef systems typical of Cook Strait.

===Walkways===
Island Bay is the starting point for two recreational walkways that cross the city. The City to Sea Walkway runs between Parliament and Island Bay through the Botanic Gardens and Aro Valley. The Southern Walkway follows the Town Belt between Island Bay and Oriental Bay.

==Island Bay Festival==
The annual Island Bay Festival takes place over eight days each February. It has included:

* The Blessing of the Boats. The Blessing of the Boats is a southern Italian tradition where boats are decorated with flags and blessed by a priest to protect the crew from the sea and to bring good fortune. The ceremony has taken place in Island Bay since 1933, when the fishing boat &quot;Santina&quot; foundered in Cook Strait, with the loss of four crew including three Italians. On 13 February 2011, during that year&#x27;s Island Bay Festival, a chair was unveiled for the crew of the &quot;Santina&quot;, presented by friends and family of the four casualties.
* The Ribble Street Races: A Soapbox derby down the steep Ribble Street attracted budding race car drivers with junior, intermediate, senior and expert categories, the latter often reaching 65 km/h.
* The Island Bay Raft Race: The inaugural raft race was in 2020, with DIY rafts and family teams paddling parallel to the beach. The Lyall Bay Surf club provided support and rescue services on the day.
* The swim to and from the Island: Participants were ferried by boat to the Island, and swam the few hundred metres back to shore. A &#x27;there and back&#x27; race was also held.
* The Festival Parade: This proceeds down The Parade to Shorland Park. In the past the Parade featured a colourful &#x27;dressing of the bicycles&#x27; competition.
* The Teddy Bears Picnic: On the final Sunday of the festival, younger members of the community brought their teddy bears for a picnic in Shorland Park.

All these Douglases were of the Morton branch of the ancient Douglas family. The Douglas family was introduced in the 17th century at Riddarhuset under number 19 among families of comital status. Gustaf Douglas later served on the board of Riddarhuset.

His maternal great-grandfather was Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg (1847–1921), a friend of Wilhelm II, whose youngest child Viktoria Ada Astrid Agnes Gräfin zu Eulenburg (1886–1967) married in 1909 (divorced 1921) Professor Otto Ludwig Haas-Heye (1879–1959), and had issue, including two daughters.

<text>KTXT-FM (88.1 MHz, &quot;88.1 The Raider&quot;) is a non-commercial educational college radio station licensed to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, United States. KTXT-FM is licensed to broadcast 35,000 watts of power to Lubbock and the surrounding South Plains of West Texas.

==History==
Early support for a college radio station at Texas Tech was expressed in 1949 in the editorial pages of the campus newspaper. Such a station was considered a &quot;necessity&quot; for the education of students in the growing field of broadcasting, and as a means of staying competitive against other colleges. The Tech Radio Club, for students interested in experimental and amateur radio, was organized in late 1948 while the Tech Broadcasting Club was organized in late 1949 for students interested in &quot;…announcing, acting, writing or working with sound effects.&quot; In the Fall of 1949, the Speech Department adds sports writing and a radio course to its curriculum and installs radio equipment of &quot;broadcast quality&quot; in its studios in the Speech Building. Also that Fall, the student body president announces that plans are underway for a campus radio station to be operational by late 1950, and &quot;…will be strictly confined to the campus buildings and dormitories in its sending powers.&quot; Despite the lack of a campus radio station, students from the Broadcasting Club and radio classes produce programs that are broadcast on various commercial radio stations in Lubbock including KCBD, KFYO and KSEL.

Texas Tech&#x27;s first radio station wasn’t a true broadcast radio station, but a carrier current station, where a low-power AM signal is sent to receivers through a building&#x27;s electrical wiring. Signal reception was limited to receivers either plugged directly into the building&#x27;s electrical system or placed close enough to the power lines which would act as a leaky feeder. The signal was limited to the building in which it was broadcast, because the electrical transformers and switch gear that supplied electricity to the building, would prevent the signal being passed elsewhere. Additional wiring had to be run directly to other buildings for the signal to be heard in them. Carrier current stations are not licensed by the FCC, but operate under the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15 (Title 47 CFR Part 15). Such stations are not issued official call signs nor are they subject to federal regulation as commercial radio stations are. Despite their limited range, carrier current stations offer several benefits: their transmitters are rather cheap and easy to construct, they can operate on any AM frequency, and if the signal originates on the campus of an educational institution, there is theoretically no power limit. By increasing the transmitter power and using inline filters, the signal quality is improved and a greater number of buildings can be served. It was these qualities that made carrier current stations quite popular among many educational institutions throughout the 1950s, including Texas Tech.

In October 1950, two groups of students, one from Sneed Hall and the other from what was then called Men&#x27;s Dorm III (Gordon Hall) started building carrier-current radio transmitters. The first system was installed and operated from Men&#x27;s Dorm III (Gordon Hall) and preliminary tests conducted for a multi-dormitory system. A second system was built and installed in the basement of Sneed Hall. Combining their efforts, they organize Tech Broadcasting System, and with sponsorship by Texas Tech vice president E. N. Jones, they seek formal recognition as a campus student group. Texas Tech&#x27;s first campus radio station, MD2 (Men&#x27;s Dorm II), operates from the social director&#x27;s office in the basement of Sneed Hall. The station broadcasts on 750 kHz at a power of 25watts, with reception limited to Sneed and West Halls. Initial programming consists of broadcasting music from records donated by students from Sneed Hall, and from local commercial station KSEL. By March 1951, additional cabling is installed which expands the signal to seven of Texas Tech&#x27;s then eight dormitories, Drane Hall being the exception as its student census was very low at the time. The station cannot be heard off-campus.

Although unlicensed, the station was operated as if it were a licensed commercial radio station, so a new name is created for it. Tech Broadcasting System creates the unofficial call letters KTTC. The new name is in keeping with commercial station call letters around the area that all start with K, and it stands for Texas Tech College. KTTC is used for the very first time during a broadcast on April 10, 1951. The station operates from 7pm to 11pm, Monday through Friday with music programs consisting of Western, Popular and Classical music. 15 students, &quot;…including 2 girls&quot;, act as DJs for the station.

In February 1952, new wiring was installed that connected the studios in the Speech Building to the KTTC head-end in Drane Hall. This allowed various interviews and dramas to be broadcast from the studios in the Speech Building. A year later, the head-end of KTTC would be moved to the Speech Building and its operational frequency changed to 650 kHz.

One major advantage that carrier-current stations had over their licensed counterparts was the ability to change operating frequencies to suit the needs of the moment, something that KTTC did with some regularity in its early years. From its start in 1950, KTTC operated at 750 kHz and continued at that spot on the radio dial until late 1952. The station moved to 650 kHz in early 1953, then was found at 1460 kHz that Fall. The station took advantage of the fact that a popular local commercial radio station, KVSP-AM operating at 1460 kHz, would sign-off around 7pm. KTTC would then begin its evening programming on 1460 at 7pm, in effect &quot;carrying over&quot; KVSP&#x27;s campus audience without them having to change the dial on the radio. 1954 found KTTC using 3 different frequencies over the year, operating at 600 in the Spring, 650 in the early Fall and 655 by year&#x27;s end. 655 kHz then became the fixed standard to find KTTC on the radio dial from early 1955 until its operational end sometime in 1960.

The original transmitter, antenna, and studios were located in the speech building and after the late seventies in the journalism building. The antenna and transmitter moved to the channel five KTXT-TV at the west end of the campus sometime after TV&#x27;s inception in 1962. Though power remained low, the antenna stood at a height of .

In the late 1960s or early 1970s, the station applied for and received a construction permit for an increase to 18,500 watts at , proposing the KTXT tower. This was extended a number of times, because of changes in plans, changes in budgets (which mostly the station did not have) and the discovery (after the big Lubbock tornado of 5-11-1970) or realization that the tower was too light and too damaged to carry the additional weight and wind load of the bigger FM station antenna. In late 1978, the station relocated to the 98th and University tower owned by Ray Moran interests (101.1 KTEZ in those days, now ch 34 KJTV).

In the early 1980s, KTXT-FM offered an eclectic mix of alternative programming ranging from oldies, new wave-80s, and reggae to house/trance, rock, country and indie. The 1980s led the way to the introduction of reggae music to the South Plains area. Reggae bands were booked in local clubs as a result and Lubbock experienced a boom in world music influence locally. As with all college radio during the 1980s, KTXT-FM was responsible for expanding the minds and opening the ears to the sounds of up-and-coming bands like REM, U2 and The Clash. While other stations in Lubbock stuck with the Chart Hits Radio (CHR) radio format, KTXT-FM drew many listeners away from commercial radio with their alternative programming, thus forcing the commercial stations to pay attention to KTXT&#x27;s playlists and DJs. Many veteran DJs can claim KTXT-FM as their first home on the air and are currently employed throughout the US as a result.

In February 1999, 88.1 became the first Lubbock FM station to broadcast on the Internet via a live audio feed.

Among the earliest broadcast equipment used included a 5,000-watt Gates FM-5H2 transmitter donated by Pat Patillo (old and longtime chief engineer of KTXT-TV), new feed line, and an eight-bay antenna. The old frequency of 91.9 could not be used for a very high power level because it would conflict with the use of another channel assigned to Lubbock (102.5) that was open for applications in those days. The new frequency used was 88.1. This proved to be a good news/bad news combination. Sister station KTXT-TV was carried on cable television on channel 6 where the sound frequency is about 87.7 MHz. At some locations near the new FM tower, there was KTXT-FM audio heard where the KTXT-TV sound should have been. The FM operated at reduced power for a time as negotiations between the sister stations went on.

In the early 1980s, the owner of KAMR-TV in Amarillo, Texas, a Texas Tech alumnus, donated their old broadcast tower to Texas Tech. This used (albeit newer and taller) tower replaced KTXT-TV&#x27;s old tower and the KTXT-FM antenna was moved back to the Tech campus. When Texas Tech assumed control of the KOHM-FM broadcast license from the Lubbock Independent School District, it too moved to the campus.

Until 2001, KTXT-FM had been run under the auspices of the School of Mass Communications at Texas Tech University. At the time, Mass Comm was redirecting its media efforts from radio to various multimedia platforms. KTXT-FM&#x27;s faculty adviser, Dr. Clive Kinghorn, retired in the fall of 2001, and control of the station was transferred to Student Media that September.

The broadcast transmitters of all three stations, KTXT-TV, KTXT-FM and KOHM-FM, were housed in the same transmitter building until July 2003 when a new transmitter building for the radio stations was completed. The conversion of KTXT-TV to a digital television station required this new facility. At some point, the Gates transmitter KTXT-FM had been using was replaced by a Broadcast Electronics FM10B, rated to 12 kW. The BE transmitter was moved into the new facility and was eventually replaced in 2007 by a new, state-of-the-art solid-state Nautel Q10 transmitter.

Around 2007, a tower crew was welding stiffeners to the cross-members of the KTXT-TV tower in order to strengthen it for the heavier load an added digital TV antenna would require. It was during this work that the KTXT-FM antenna was significantly damaged. The antenna was eventually replaced by an antenna donated by Clear Channel Communications of Lubbock. The donated antenna was formerly used by 98 Kool (KCCL-FM), and was sent to the factory, refurbished and re-tuned for 88.1.

In 2012 the new KTXT logo was designed by a Texas Tech graphic design student, Nicholas Ryan Vatzlavick while working at the College of Mass Communications (now College of Media and Communications).

In 2020, Malone Graham and Branson Nash took over the sports department.

In 2021, Vanessa Hakizimana took over as sports department head. Collin Lee, Nathanael Boles, and Christian Hay became the new sports reporters/commentators.

==Cessation and return==
KTXT-FM abruptly stopped broadcasting 2:35 PM CST on December 10, 2008. Student Media cited budget constraints as the reason behind the station closure. Student Media retained control of the studios, using them as offices, while the bulk of the broadcast equipment would be transferred to Texas Tech&#x27;s other FM radio station, KOHM. Broadcasts from the former studios were no longer possible after December 10, and KTXT-FM was off the air.

Control of KTXT-FM was transferred to KOHM-FM (Now KTTZ-FM) in January 2009. Relocation of the microwave studio/transmitter links to the KOHM studios were completed in early May 2009, and test broadcasts were conducted. KTXT-FM returned to the air in late May with a broadcast schedule consisting mainly of network programming via satellite. The lack of proper studio facilities has been cited by KOHM management as the reason for KTXT-FM&#x27;s automated/unattended operation. KOHM/KTTZ station management had expressed a long-term goal of returning students to the operation of KTXT-FM.

On July 1, 2012, KTXT-FM was once again belting out alternative/college hits. KTXT-FM is once again operated by the College of Mass Communications. As of this date the station has returned, with students said to be running the station. New studios, equipment, and offices are being installed in the Mass Communications Building. (Former Business Administration Building)

==Ownership==

KTXT-FM is owned and licensed to Texas Tech University and as of March 1, 2013 is student operated, and controlled by the College of Media and Communication., and is no longer controlled by Texas Tech Student Media, The Department of Continuing Education, KOHM-FM (now KTTZ-FM), or the Office of the Provost. From September 2001 until December 2008, KTXT-FM operated under Texas Tech Student Media. From December 2008 until March 2011, KTXT-FM was run in conjunction with KOHM-FM and reported to the Texas Tech University Office of the Provost. In March 2011, KOHM-FM, KTXT-FM (and KNCH-FM) were moved back into the Texas Tech College of Mass Communications, reporting to the Dean of that college, and coming full circle back to where they had started.

An administrative change in September 2011 resulted in both KOHM-FM and KNCH-FM being moved administratively under the Texas Tech Public Television station KTXT-TV, while KTXT-FM was kept in the College of Mass Communications. A small studio for KTXT-FM was set up in the basement of the Mass Communications building, and the Fall semester of 2011 saw the first real return of students to 88.1. In January 2012, the call letters for both KOHM-FM and KTXT-TV were changed to KTTZ-FM and KTTZ-TV respectively, leaving KTXT-FM with the university&#x27;s oldest original call-letters still in use.

In August 2012, KTXT-FM, along with the College of Mass Communications, relocated to the newly renovated Business Administration building located at 15th Street and Flint Avenue. The College also changed its name during this move and is now known as the Texas Tech University College of Media and Communication.

==Format==
In its heyday, KTXT-FM was one of the most powerful college radio stations in the United States, operating with 35,000 watts of power. As a college radio station with an Alternative music format, KTXT-FM broadcast a wide range of music genres, including dance, modern rock, R&amp;B/hip hop, and Texas country music.

One of the best known blocks of KTXT programming was 10pm Friday until 7am Saturday from 1989 to 1993.

The 10pm1am block featured a program called &quot;Shockwaves&quot;. Originally created by Craig Crafton (aka &quot;3C&quot;) in 1988 Shockwaves featured a variety of then cutting edge techno, trance, rave, ragga, electro, ambient and house music. Crafton left the area a couple of years later and Shockwaves was then hosted full-time by Jeff Wros (aka DJ Piccadilly) who, by then, had been working under Crafton in the co-host capacity. In the final years the show added an extra hour as well as co-host Daniel Alanzo (aka DJ Daniel Dub), who became the resident house music DJ. The show ended December 13, 1993. Other late night programs included &quot;Megahertz,&quot; a heavy metal program with the tagline, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t just hurt, it Megahertz.&quot; Weekday daytime programming included the listener request show &quot;Power Lunch.&quot;

From 1992 to 1994, the 1am4am block was the Midnight Maniacs with Moon Doggie (Daniel Light), Master Poe (Ben Hight), Ice Troy (Troy Hollers) and Mr. Todd (Mr. Todd). This show was full of antics, great alternative music, call-ins, prizes and even an early-morning pizza delivery to one lucky listener. Then it was Shaggy and his one-man fan club keeping things going until 7 am. (Light and Hight would later have success as the Cable Ace award-winning producers and hosts of the show &quot;Generation X&quot;. Hight who has gone on to work with numerous Lubbock stations and is now currently with TownSquare Media Lubbock station KZII FM 102.5.)

From October 2009 until June 30, 2012, KTXT&#x27;s programming was all via satellite, consisting of PRI&#x27;s &quot;The TakeAway&quot; during weekday morning drivetime, BBC World Service programming during the mid-day and afternoon, and music from the Jazz Satellite Network during overnights.

Some of the one-liners used by many of KTXT&#x27;s DJs include: &quot;Lubbock&#x27;s Only Alternative&quot;, &quot;The Couch&quot;, &quot;Keep it locked to the left&quot; and &quot;Music your parents warned you about!&quot; Or one from the 1980s, &quot;You&#x27;re all the way to the left at 88.1 KTXT-FM&quot;.

As of July 1, 2012 KTXT-FM returned to the Lubbock airwaves with the students of Texas Tech University at the helm. KTXT-FM is once again an alternative/college format, with minimal breaks for station identification

<text>Werl Prison has about 900 inmates, and is one of the largest prisons in Germany. It is located in the town of Werl in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of Dortmund.

In April 1945, the 95th Infantry Division (United States) &quot;Victory&quot; division uncovered a German prison and civilian labor camp in the town of Werl. On April 7, the unit reported discovering a camp housing some 4,500 undernourished French officers and 800 enlisted men. The 95th provided the prisoners with emergency rations from the division&#x27;s own supplies.

The 95th Infantry Division (United States) was recognized as a liberating unit by the United States Army Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1995.

After World War II, the British military used Werl Prison to house Nazi war criminals they had convicted during the occupation. They released their last two inmates on June 24, 1957. The prisoners were Hans Kühne, a former Luftwaffe pilot who was complicit in the murders of four Royal Canadian Air Force airmen, and Wilhelm Katerndahl, a local Nazi Party leader who was complicit in the murder of an RAF airman. The British military also carried out several executions by firing squad of Nazi war criminals at Werl Prison.

<text>Petrof is a Czech piano manufacturer founded in 1864. It is the leading European piano manufacturer, exporting to more than 60 countries.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1864 in Hradec Králové, Kingdom of Bohemia, by Antonín Petrof (d. 1915), who had apprenticed at Viennese companies such as Heintzman &amp; Co., Friedrich Ehrbar and Schweighofer.

The owner Antonín Petrof was awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria-Hungary. In 1924 the company was exporting its pianos to Europe, Japan, China, Australia and South America.

At the World Exhibition 1934 in Brussels, the Petrof instruments won the gold medal. At that time, approximately 400 people worked at their factory.

After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état, the company was nationalized. 

In 1991, the company was returned to the Petrof family. Petrof is currently led by two sisters from the fifth generation of the Petrof family and produces annually approximately 2,000 grand pianos and 12,000 upright pianos. Petrof is known for several innovations, such as ways to adjust the mechanics and particularly pressure point through magnetic systems.

After 1993, the piano company G. Rösler of Česká Lípa, Bohemia was acquired.

== Notable performers ==
Petrof pianos have been used by many famous musicians, including among others: Ray Charles, Paul McCartney, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Sviatoslav Richter, Count Basie, Richard Clayderman, Ennio Morricone, Renato Carosone and Mark Levinson.

<text>The 1928 United States Senate elections were elections that coincided with the presidential election of Republican Herbert Hoover. The 32 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. The strong economy helped the Republicans to gain seven seats from the Democrats.

Senate Majority leader, Republican Charles Curtis of Kansas, was not up for election this cycle, but he was elected U.S. Vice President. He resigned March 3, 1929, so his seat was vacant at the beginning of the next Congress until April 1, 1929, when a Republican was appointed to continue the term.

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
Two Republicans and one Democrat retired instead of seeking re-election.

===Defeats===

On March 31, 1928, Governor Fred W. Green appointed 44-year-old Republican Arthur H. Vandenberg to fill the vacancy, pending a special election. Green considered resigning so he could be appointed to the vacancy. He also considered several other candidates, including former governors Albert Sleeper and Chase Osborn. In addition, Green considered Representative Joseph W. Fordney, who would have been a placeholder until the election for the remainder of Ferris&#x27; term. Green finally decided upon Vandenberg, who immediately declared his intention to stand for election to both the short, unexpired term and the full six-year term. Both the special and the general elections were held the same day, November 6, 1928.

<text>Watch Your Mouth is a novel by American writer Daniel Handler.

It tells the story of protagonist Joseph&#x27;s lust-filled college summer spent with his Jewish girlfriend Cynthia Glass in her hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Handler has described it as an &quot;opera in book form&quot;.

==Plot==
The first part of the novel is laid out as an opera, with act and scene numbers as chapter titles and each of the characters being assigned a singing voice. Joseph quickly begins to suspect that Cynthia&#x27;s entire family is engaging in incestuous behaviour, and that her mother Mimi is building a golem in the basement. The first part of the novel ends (operatically) in death. The second part is presented somewhat more conventionally, as Joseph attempts to recover from the events of the first part; this half of the book follows the form of a 12-step program. The first section of the novel is printed in black ink, while the 12-step program is printed in dark red.

<text>Hataitai is an inner-city suburb of Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, 3.5 kilometres southeast of the city centre. The suburb extends over the southeastern flank of Mount Victoria and down a valley between the Town Belt and a ridge along the shoreline of Evans Bay. Hataitai is bounded by Hepara Street, Grafton Road and the suburb of Roseneath in the north, Wellington Harbour in the east, Cobham Drive, Wellington Road and Crawford Road in the south, and Alexandra Road in the west.

Hataitai is on important transport links between the central city and Wellington Airport, to the south of Evans Bay on the isthmus at Rongotai. It is at the eastern end of the Mount Victoria Tunnel and the bus-only Hataitai Tunnel, built in 1907 for trams, making Hataitai a popular place to live.

==Origin of name==
The earliest European pioneers in Wellington knew the area that became Hataitai as &quot;Jenkins Estate&quot;. The name &quot;Hataitai&quot; originated with the syndicate which sub-divided it for building in 1901, and derives from , the name of one of the two brother taniwha (sea monsters) that formed Te Whanganui-a-Tara (The Great Harbour of Tara/Wellington Harbour). However, it is Miramar Peninsula that is thought to be the petrified remains of the great taniwha Whātaitai.

The story goes that when the taniwha Ngake broke through the mountains that separated the then-lake from the Cook Strait, the waters rushed out, leaving his older brother Whātaitai stranded on the rocks as he tried to escape after him. An earthquake later lifted Whātaitai&#x27;s body completely out of the water, causing him to dry out and pass away. With his body having turned to earth, Whātaitai&#x27;s spirit manifested into a bird that flew to the top of Tangi Te Keo (Mount Victoria) to mourn never being able to be with his brother again.

==Settlement==
Colonial settlement of the area dates from 1841, with land used mainly for farming and grazing. Robert Jenkins acquired a hundred acres of hill pasture. In order to reach it he made a road up Mount Victoria, fenced much of his land and used it for breeding horses. Population was minimal until the late 19th century. In the early days the area was part of Kilbirnie in the Evans Bay district – so the school opened in Moxham Ave in 1884 was called Kilbirnie School. In 1901 the Hataitai Land Company was formed to sell sections on the hillsides north from Waitoa Road, and the area became known as Hataitai. In 1902 the new suburb was advertised by the cutting of gigantic letters spelling &#x27;HATAITAI&#x27; in the turf of the town side of Mount Victoria. Many of the streets in Hataitai are named after native trees: Hinau Road, Konini Road, Matai Road, Rata Road, Rewa Road etc.

Significant development took place from the early 20th century into the 1950s, spurred by improved access via the Hataitai tram (now bus) tunnel (opened in 1907) and the Mt Victoria tunnel (1931). The population increased slightly between 2001 and 2006, a result of new dwellings being added to the area.

==Demographics==
Hataitai covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Hataitai had a population of 5,493 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 243 people (4.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 324 people (6.3%) since the 2006 census.

==Amenities==
A small shopping village is centred on Moxham Avenue and Waitoa Road. In 2011 Wellington City Council added Hataitai Village shops to its District Plan list of heritage buildings. The heritage listings mean the buildings are recognised and protected for their heritage value and any major changes to the outside of listed buildings, or demolition of them, would require resource consent. Most of the buildings at the village date from the 1910s and 1920s and together they form a historic streetscape that is rare in Wellington.

Sports facilities include the Badminton Hall on Ruahine Street and Hataitai Park on the Town Belt. Hataitai Park has a velodrome, tennis courts and rugby fields. Other community facilities include a community centre and bowling club, both of which offer venues for community activities, a medical centre, three churches (All Saints Anglican, Hataitai Methodist, Latter-day Saints) and the Treasure Grove and Waipapa Road Play Areas. In addition, the Alexandra Road Play area is accessible from Hepara Street, with a 180 degree view from Wellington Harbour&#x27;s Eastbourne to Lyall Bay in the South and only a short walk to the Mount Victoria summit.

<doc id="1319341" wikidata="Q4923457" url="?curid=1319341" title="Blackthorn Cider">
<text>Blackthorn Cider is a cider produced by Gaymer Cider Company, a subsidiary of C&amp;C Group. Previously it was known as Blackthorn Dry or Dry Blackthorn. It is sold in a variety of forms, commonly being served draught in pubs or being sold in cans or two-litre bottles in shops or supermarkets.

==Background==
The Taunton Cider Company had produced traditional ciders from 1905 in Norton Fitzwarren, and became a limited company in 1921. After World War II, Taunton bought up local competitors, and from the 1950s started developing pasteurised sparkling ciders, which allowed the company to distribute product across the United Kingdom. The first Blackthorn-branded ciders were produced from the 1960s onwards, and became the company&#x27;s main product line. In 1996, drinks company Matthew Clark plc, the UK division of Constellation Brands Inc., acquired Taunton Cider and all of its associated brands for £256 million.

==Production and formulation==
As a non-traditional pasteurised sparkling cider, Blackthorn does not fit the definition of &quot;real cider&quot; as defined by the Campaign for Real Ale. Where traditional cider is made with whole pressed apples fermented by the wild yeasts present on the skins, Blackthorn contains apple concentrate, sugar and sweeteners and is fermented with a controlled yeast strain.

Until 2016, Blackthorn was produced at the C&amp;C Group site on the A37 in Shepton Mallet (Mendip district, Somerset, England). After the production was moved from Norton Fitzwarren, the recipe was changed, making the taste sweeter and raising the alcohol content to bring the product more into line with the market leader Strongbow.

In March 2009, Blackthorn was reformulated. It was not well received by many consumers in its heartland in the south-west of England, who defaced The &#x27;Black is Back&#x27; advertising campaign, alerted the press to their cause and organised Facebook protests. In March 2010, however, Gaymers announced that after the consumer backlash in the south-west, the &#x27;original&#x27; Dry Blackthorn recipe would be re-introduced in the region. As a result, there are now two clearly defined products, Blackthorn and Dry Blackthorn, the latter being the original recipe, available only in the West Country.

In January 2016, C&amp;C Group announced that the Shepton Mallet site would close in summer 2016, with production and packaging transferred to Ireland. It was also announced that C&amp;C would &#x27;continue to source apples on a long-term basis from local farmers&#x27; and &#x27;warehousing operations will be maintained in the town&#x27;.

<doc id="1319347" wikidata="Q748288" url="?curid=1319347" title="Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award">
<text>The Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award, officially billed as the MBNA/MasterCard Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award, was an award in ice hockey given annually to the goaltender who finished the regular season with the best save percentage in the National Hockey League (NHL). Only goaltenders who played 25 games or more in the season were eligible for the award. A goaltender&#x27;s save percentage represents the percentage of shots on goal that he stops, and is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal.

The award was first presented at the conclusion of the , and was named in honor of former Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals goaltender Roger Crozier, a Calder and Conn Smythe Trophy winner who played in the NHL from 1964 to 1977. It was presented by the MBNA corporation in memory of Crozier, who worked for the MBNA America Bank after retiring as a player, and died on January 11, 1996. The winner of the trophy received a commemorative crystal trophy and was given US$25,000 to donate to a youth hockey or other educational program of their choice.

By 2007, when it ceased being presented, the award had been handed to six different players on seven occasions. Marty Turco is the only goaltender to have won the award twice. Three Dallas Stars goalies have won the award, while two each have represented the Montreal Canadiens and the Minnesota Wild. Only seven awards were ever made. The award was not presented in 2005, as the entire was canceled due to the lockout.

==Facilities==
===Library===
Khandallah Library was opened in 1953 in the middle of Khandallah village on Ganges Road, after a 1947 petition by local writer Fanny Irvine-Smith. The library serves an average of 1600 customers a week. The Greater Wellington Regional Council local rain gauge is located here.

===Town Hall===
The Khandallah Town Hall has a capacity of over 350 people, including 140 seats and 20 tables and has a stage, kitchen and gallery. It was built in 1912 as the Khandallah Public Hall.

===Recreation centre and park===
Nairnville Recreation Centre features a multi-purpose sports hall suitable for basketball, netball, volleyball, and badminton. A squash court is available for hire and an upstairs community room with kitchen facilities.

Nairnville Park features sports fields that are used for football, rugby and cricket. An artificial turf was added in March 2009. The park also includes a children&#x27;s playground, cricket training nets and a skateboard half pipe.

Nairnville Park and Recreation Centre are named after James and Louisa Nairn who owned farm land in the area.

===Swimming pool===
Khandallah summer pool is a 30-metre unheated outdoor summer pool at the end of Woodmancote Road. Between 2022 and 2024 Wellington City Council considered future options for the pool, including demolition. In June 2024, Council voted to keep the Khandallah Summer Pool open for another season while looking for solutions to refurbish the pool with a budget allocation of $7.5 million.

==Transport==
The suburb is served by the Johnsonville Branch commuter railway which connects it to the central city and surrounding suburbs. It has three railway stations; Khandallah, Box Hill and Simla Crescent. Parts of the suburb nearer the harbour and some distance from the stations are served by several Metlink bus routes.

==Education==
===School enrolment zones===
Khandallah is within the enrolment zones for Wellington Girls&#x27; College, Onslow College, Raroa Normal Intermediate and St Oran&#x27;s College.

===Primary schools===

Khandallah has three primary schools.

Cashmere Avenue School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 6 students, with a roll of as of .

Khandallah School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 6 students, with a roll of . The school is on Clark St and the site was first occupied by a school in January 1893.

St Benedict&#x27;s School is a co-educational state-integrated Catholic primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of . The school is on Nicholson Road and was opened in 1952 by Archbishop Peter Cardinal McKeefry. The school was integrated with the state school system in 1981.

== History ==
Khandallah is named after Khandela, Rajasthan, or may be Khandala and supposedly means &quot;Resting place of God&quot; in an unspecified language. It is noteworthy that KhānAllāh means the hostel of God in Arabic. Hence the suburb and those surrounding it have many place names connected with the Indian subcontinent; e.g. Calcutta Street, Ganges Road and Simla Crescent.

The name may have come from a homestead built in the area in 1884 by Captain James Andrew, who had recently returned from duty in India and had been consul in Baghdad. When the railway was laid through the area by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, Andrew is reported as insisting that the railway station be named &quot;Khandallah&quot; with the &quot;h&quot; on the end of the name, and reportedly gave land for the Khandallah station provided all trains stop there.
However, Edward Battersbee (also spelt Battersby) was listed in the 1864–1865 Province of Wellington electoral roll as living at Khandallah, Porirua Road on 23 April 1864 some 20 years earlier than Andrew. In addition Battersby had worked for the East India Company as a veterinary surgeon in the Bombay Light Cavalry, thereby making him the more likely originator of the suburb&#x27;s name. In January 1868 Battersbee placed his 450-acre property, named in the advertisement as &quot;Khrandalah&quot;, on the market for sale.

Another settler from the British Indian Army was Captain Charles Sharp of the Bombay Native Infantry who lived elsewhere but bought land around the Khandallah railway station and let it to sheep farmer Captain John Kirwan. In 1894 Robert Hanna bought it for subdivision.

When the formation of the Borough of Onslow was proposed in 1889, Khandallah was already described as a District, and was a part of the Onslow Borough until it merged with Wellington in 1919.

Khandallah was largely farmland to the 1920s; James Nairn built a farmhouse in 1869 on the old Ngatoto Native Reserve, now Nairnville Park. The opening of the railway to Wellington in 1886 (now the Johnsonville Branch) enabled people to commute into Wellington, and the line was electrified with more frequent and faster trains in 1938. The population of Khandallah increased from 766 in 1916 to 2,498 in 1938.

Access was originally via the Old Porirua Road until new access roads opened; Onslow Road down to the Hutt Road in the 1920s and Burma Road to Johnsonville (superseding Fraser Avenue) in 1936.

<text>&quot;Number 12 Looks Just Like You&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It is set in a dystopian future in which everyone, upon reaching adulthood, has their body surgically altered into one of a set of physically attractive models.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In a future society, all nineteen-year-olds go through a process known as &quot;the Transformation&quot;, in which each person&#x27;s body is changed to a physically attractive design chosen from a selection of numbered models. The process also slows deterioration due to age and confers immunity to disease, extending human lifespans, as well as making unspecified psychological corrections. Due to the overwhelming popularity of female model 12 and male model 17, all adults wear name badges to avoid confusion.

Eighteen-year-old Marilyn Cuberle decides not to undergo the Transformation. Nobody else can understand Marilyn&#x27;s decision, and her family and best friend are all confused by her displeasure with the conformity and shallowness of contemporary life. Her &quot;radical&quot; beliefs were fostered by her now-deceased father, who gave Marilyn banned books and came to regret his own Transformation years earlier, committing suicide upon the loss of his identity. Her mother takes her to see Dr. Rex, who initially thinks Marilyn wants to have the procedure early, but is shocked to learn about Marilyn&#x27;s refusal.

Dr. Rex sends her to Professor Sigmund Friend, who claims that the Transformation is justified as it has led to the end of war and hate in society, along with many health benefits, in addition to the change in appearance. When Marilyn protests that she still does not want the procedure, he has Marilyn confined to a hospital room against her will, ostensibly to psychologically examine her and cure her of her reason for refusing the procedure. Marilyn suspects that despite not being legally required, the Transformation is not optional, and is being maintained by the leaders of society to ensure conformity. Her best friend Valerie, who has already undergone the Transformation, shows no emotional reaction to Marilyn&#x27;s protests, even when she is driven to tears. Marilyn realizes that no one who has undergone the Transformation remains capable of any empathy for or understanding of her. She tries to escape from the hospital, but ends up in the operating room to undergo the Transformation.

Dr. Rex, who operated on Marilyn, comments that some people have problems with the idea of the Transformation but that &quot;improvements&quot; to the procedure now guarantee a positive result. Marilyn reappears, looking and thinking &quot;exactly&quot; like Valerie. &quot;And the nicest part of all, Val&quot;, she gushes, &quot;I look just like you!&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Program notes==
To show this future society in this episode, Suzy Parker and Pam Austin play almost all of the female roles (actress Collin Wilcox plays protagonist Marilyn prior to her transformation), while Richard Long plays all of the male roles; dialogue in the episode indicates that Parker and Long portray the most popular models selected for the Transformation. According to show producer William Froug, Parker was specifically cast because she &quot;was at the time the most famous model in the [United States] ... it was my notion that if you were going to do a show about everybody looking as beautiful as possible to use her.&quot;

This episode was originally sponsored by American Tobacco (Pall Mall), with an &quot;alternate sponsors&quot; message (from Procter &amp; Gamble) in the middle.

==Cultural influence==
This episode highlights Hollywood&#x27;s age-obsession and youthful looks for women, as well as themes of conformity and individuality. Although Collin Wilcox (b. 1935) and Suzy Parker (b. 1932) had only a three-year age difference, Wilcox played the daughter of Parker&#x27;s character. Wilcox was aged 29 playing an 18-year-old.

The 2005 novel &quot;Uglies&quot; shares several themes with this episode. It also takes place in a future where teens receive an operation to look &#x27;perfect&#x27; and live healthier and longer and centers on a girl who initially refuses the operation.

The band The Number Twelve Looks Like You took their name from the title of this episode.

Charlie Brooker stated in an interview that this episode influenced &quot;Fifteen Million Merits&quot;, an episode of his anthology series, &quot;Black Mirror&quot;.

Dr. Evil from the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; franchise used the same pinky gestures as Richard Long from this episode.

<doc id="1319366" wikidata="Q16335146" url="?curid=1319366" title="Sequence profiling tool">
<text>A sequence profiling tool in bioinformatics is a type of software that presents information related to a genetic sequence, gene name, or keyword input. Such tools generally take a query such as a DNA, RNA, or protein sequence or ‘keyword’ and search one or more databases for information related to that sequence. Summaries and aggregate results are provided in standardized format describing the information that would otherwise have required visits to many smaller sites or direct literature searches to compile. Many sequence profiling tools are software portals or gateways that simplify the process of finding information about a query in the large and growing number of bioinformatics databases. The access to these kinds of tools is either web based or locally downloadable executables.

==Introduction and usage==

The &quot;post-genomics&quot; era has given rise to a range of web-based tools and software to compile, organize, and deliver large amounts of primary sequence information, as well as protein structures, gene annotations, sequence alignments, and other common bioinformatics tasks.

In general, there exist three types of databases and service providers. The first one includes the popular public-domain or open-access databases supported by funding and grants such as NCBI, ExPASy, Ensembl, and PDB. The second one includes smaller or more specific databases organized and compiled by individual research groups Examples include Yeast Genome Database, RNA database. The third and final one includes private corporate or institutional databases that require payment or institutional affiliation to access. Such examples are rare given the globalization of public databases, unless the purported service is ‘in-development’ or the end point of the analysis is of commercial value.

Typical scenarios of a profiling approach become relevant, particularly, in the cases of the first two groups, where researchers commonly wish to combine information derived from several sources about a single query or target sequence. For example, users might use the sequence alignment and search tool BLAST to identify homologs of their gene of interest in other species, and then use these results to locate a solved protein structure for one of the homologs. Similarly, they might also want to know the likely secondary structure of the mRNA encoding the gene of interest, or whether a company sells a DNA construct containing the gene. Sequence profiling tools serve to automate and integrate the process of seeking such disparate information by rendering the process of searching several different external databases transparent to the user.

Many public databases are already extensively linked so that complementary information in another database is easily accessible; for example, Genbank and the PDB are closely intertwined. However, specialized tools organized and hosted by specific research groups can be difficult to integrate into this linkage effort because they are narrowly focused, are frequently modified, or use custom versions of common file formats. Advantages of sequence profiling tools include the ability to use multiple of these specialized tools in a single query and present the output with a common interface, the ability to direct the output of one set of tools or database searches into the input of another, and the capacity to disseminate hosting and compilation obligations to a network of research groups and institutions rather than a single centralized repository.

==Keyword based profilers==

Most of the profiling tools available on the web today fall into this category. The user, upon visiting the site/tool, enters any relevant information like a keyword e.g. dystrophy, diabetes etc., or GenBank accession numbers, PDB ID. All the relevant hits by the search are presented in a format unique to each tool&#x27;s main focus. Profiling tools based on keyword searches are essentially search engines that are highly specialized for bioinformatics work, thereby eliminating a clutter of irrelevant or non-scholarly hits that might occur with a traditional search engine like Google. Most keyword-based profiling tools allow flexible types of keyword input, accession numbers from indexed databases as well as traditional keyword descriptors.

Each profiling tool has its own focus and area of interest. For example, the NCBI search engine Entrez segregates its hits by category, so that users looking for protein structure information can screen out sequences with no corresponding structure, while users interested in perusing the literature on a subject can view abstracts of papers published in scholarly journals without distraction from gene or sequence results. The PubMed biosciences literature database is a popular tool for literature searches, though this service is nearly equaled with the more general Google Scholar.

Keyword-based data aggregation services like the Bioinformatic Harvester performs provide reports from a variety of third-party servers in an &quot;as-is&quot; format so that users need not visit the website or install the software for each individual component service. This is particularly invaluable given the rapid emergence of various sites providing different sequence analysis and manipulation tools. Another aggregative web portal, the Human Protein Reference Database (Hprd), contains manually annotated and curated entries for human proteins. The information provided is thus both selective and comprehensive, and the query format is flexible and intuitive. The pros of developing manually curated databases include presentation of proofread material and the concept of ‘molecule authorities’ to undertake the responsibility of specific proteins. However, the cons are that they are typically slower to update and may not contain very new or disputed data.

==Sequence data based profilers==

A typical sequence profiling tool carries this further by using an actual DNA, RNA, or protein sequence as an input and allows the user to visit different web-based analysis tools to obtain the information desired. Such tools are also commonly supplied with commercial laboratory equipment like gene sequencers or sometimes sold as software applications for molecular biology. In another public-database example, the BLAST sequence search report from NCBI provides a link from its alignment report to other relevant information in its own databases, if such specific information exists.

For example, a retrieved record that contains a human sequence will carry a separate link that connects to its location on a human genome map; a record that contains a sequence for which a 3-D structure has been solved would carry a link that connects it to its structure database. Sequerome, a public service tool, links the entire BLAST report to many third party servers/sites that provide highly specific services in sequence manipulations such as restriction enzyme maps, open reading frame analyses for nucleotide sequences, and secondary structure prediction. The tool provides added advantage of maintaining a research log of the operations performed by the user, which can be then conveniently archived using &#x27;mail&#x27;, &#x27;print&#x27; or &#x27;save&#x27; functionality. Thus an entire operation of researching on a sequence using different research tools and thus carrying a project to its completion can be completed within one browser interface. Consequently, future generation of sequence profiling tools would include ability to collaborate online with researchers to share project logs and research tools, annotate results of sequence analysis or lab work, customize and automate the processing of sets of sequence data etc. InstaSeq is a Google powered search tool that allows the user to directly enter a sequence and search the entire World Wide Web. This unique search engine, which is the only one of its kind, is in contrast to searching specific databases e.g. GenBank.

As a result, the user can end up with a privately hosted document or a page from a lesser known database from just about anywhere in the world. Though the presence of sequence based profilers are far and few in the present scenario, their key role will become evident when huge amounts of sequence data need to be cross processed across portals and domains.

==Future growth and directions==
The proliferation of bioinformatics tools for genetic analysis aids researchers in identifying and categorizing genes and gene sets of interest in their work; however, the large variety of tools that perform substantially similar aggregative and analytical functions can also confuse and frustrate new users. The decentralization encouraged by aggregative tools allows individual research groups to maintain specialized servers dedicated to specific types of data analysis in the expectation that their output will be collected into a larger report on a gene or protein of interest to other researchers.

Data produced by microarray experiments, two-hybrid screening, and other high-throughput biological experiments is voluminous and difficult to analyze by hand; the efforts of structural genomics collaborations that are aimed at quickly solving large numbers of highly varied protein structures also increase the need for integration between sequence and structure databases and portals. This impetus toward developing more comprehensive and more user-friendly methods of sequence profiling makes this an active area of research among current genomics researchers.

<text>Maurice Joseph François Engelen (born 7 January 1959), known by his stage name Praga Khan, is a Belgian electronic musician. Khan is considered one of the leading pioneers of the new beat/acid house/techno electronic dance music scene that originated in Belgium. Khan has also contributed to the theatrical scene with his musical collaborations in &quot;The Next Dimension&quot; and &quot;Code Red&quot;. The group mostly performs in English, but has also released singles in German (&quot;Tausend Sterne&quot;). 

==Career==
In the late 1980s, Khan teamed up with Jade 4U (Nikkie van Lierop) and Olivier Adams to form Lords of Acid and multiple other projects including Channel X and Digital Orgasm. Khan&#x27;s most famous solo work is &quot;Injected with a Poison&quot; (1992). The single &quot;Free Your Body / Injected with a Poison&quot;, by Praga Khan featuring Jade 4U, reached #16 in the UK. &quot;Rave Alert&quot; also charted (#39).

In 1992, Channel X&#x27;s &quot;Rave the Rhythm&quot; was included in the soundtrack for &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, after director Paul Verhoeven had by chance heard the track in a New York City disco during the shooting. After this, other tracks were included into other movies, including &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Virtuosity&quot;, &quot;Strange Days&quot; and &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;. He also composed a music album for the video game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, with Olivier Adams as The Immortals.

Khan produced three mixes of the song &quot;Again&quot; for the band Alice in Chains, released as B-sides on international CD singles in 1996. In the liner notes of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set collection, Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell said of the mixes:
With the release of the CD &quot;21st Century Skin&quot; in 1999, Khan became a major music act in his home country. The album included the singles &quot;Breakfast in Vegas&quot;, &quot;Luv U Still&quot; (Pragamatic) and &quot;Lonely&quot;. The album sold more than 25,000 copies. This earned him a place at Rock Werchter, where he performed live.

At the end of 1999, Praga Khan performed as a solo act in the United States for the first time (as an opener for Lords of Acid, with the same musicians) and released the album &quot;Mutant Funk&quot; that same year. The album rapidly climbed the charts, spending two weeks at No. 2 in the Belgian album chart. The band performed at Werchter again, this time as headliners on the big stage on the first day. This was the first Belgian act to achieve this. The album was a success and included the hits &quot;Power of the Flower&quot;, &quot;Sayonara Greetings&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;.

Praga Khan also appeared as a judge on the Belgian edition of &quot;X Factor&quot;.

In June 2010, Khan announced that the Lords of Acid project would be touring the US during July and August 2010, bringing along their friends My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, for what was being billed as the &quot;Sextreme Ball&quot;. Although the Lords of Acid had indicated that there was a dispute over the ownership of some of their &quot;official&quot; websites, Khan began using his personal and professional social media accounts, to help raise awareness of the tour.

Khan released the album &quot;SoulSplitter&quot; in 2013 and performed a concert at Ancienne Belgique (with support by Psy&#x27;Aviah) to celebrate 25 years on stage.

Khan announced via his Twitter that his 10th album &quot;MindSnatcher&quot; would be released on 31 March 2015, but the album was delayed due to the re-establishment of Praga Khan&#x27;s second studio. The new album was renamed &quot;MindGames&quot; and the release date was rescheduled for 27 October 2016, but further postponements led the CD to ultimately be released on 21 May 2017.
