<text>The Welch Regiment (or &quot;The Welch&quot;, an archaic spelling of &quot;Welsh&quot;) was an infantry regiment of the line of the British Army in existence from 1881 until 1969. The regiment was created in 1881 under the Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot and 69th (South Lincolnshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Welsh Regiment, by which it was known until 1920 when it was renamed the Welch Regiment. In 1969 the regiment was amalgamated with the South Wales Borderers to form the Royal Regiment of Wales.

==History==
===Formation===
The regiment was created in 1881 under the Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot and 69th (South Lincolnshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Welsh Regiment.

The 1st Battalion moved to Egypt in 1886. The battalion took part in the Battle of Suakin in December 1888 during the Mahdist War under the leadership of the force commander, Colonel Herbert Kitchener, who wrote in his dispatches:
The 1st Battalion moved to Malta in 1889 while the 2nd Battalion went to India in 1892; the 1st Battalion moved to Pembroke Dock in December 1893 where almost all the regiment&#x27;s artifacts, plate and silver were lost in a large fire in 1895. The 1st Battalion was dispatched to South Africa in November 1899 for the Second Boer War: it was engaged in Battle of Paardeberg in February 1900, where they suffered heavy losses, and again at the Battle of Driefontein in March 1900.

A 3rd, militia battalion, was embodied in December 1899, and embarked for South Africa in February 1900 to serve in the same war. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve battalion and four Territorial battalions.

===First World War===

====Regular Army====
The 1st Battalion, after returning from India, landed at Le Havre as part of the 84th Brigade in 28th Division in January 1915 for service on the Western Front but moved to Egypt and then on to Salonika in November 1915. The 2nd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 3rd Brigade in the 1st Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. Lance Corporal William Charles Fuller, of the 2nd Battalion, won the Welsh Regiment&#x27;s first Victoria Cross of the war when, under withering and sustained rifle and machine gun fire, he advanced one hundred yards to rescue Captain Mark Haggard who was mortally wounded on Chézy sur Aisne on 14 September 1914.

====Territorial Force====
The 1/4th Battalion and 1/5th Battalion landed at Suvla Bay as part of the 159th Brigade in the 53rd (Welsh) Division in August 1915; after being evacuated from Gallipoli in December 1915 the battalion moved to Egypt. The 1/6th (Glamorgan) Battalion was part of the independent South Wales Brigade allocated to home defence, but volunteered for overseas service. It landed at Le Havre in October 1914 to work on the Lines of Communication on the Western Front. It later fought alongside the 1st Battalion with 28th Division at the Hohenzollern Redoubt and spent the rest of the war as the divisional pioneer battalion for 1st Division

====New Armies====
The 8th (Service) Battalion landed at ANZAC Cove as part of the 40th Brigade in the 13th (Western) Division in August 1915; after being evacuated from Gallipoli in December 1915 the battalion moved to Egypt and on to Mesopotamia in February 1916. Captain Edgar Myles, of the 8th (Service) Battalion, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Siege of Kut in April 1916 during the Mesopotamian campaign.

The 9th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 58th Brigade in the 19th (Western) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 10th (Service) Battalion (1st Rhondda) landed at Le Havre as part of the 114th Brigade in 38th (Welsh) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 11th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 67th Brigade in the 22nd Division in September 1915 for service on the Western Front and then moved to Salonika in late 1915. Private Hubert William Lewis, of the 11th (Service) Battalion, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Evzonoi in Macedonia in October 1916 during the Macedonian campaign.

The 13th (Service) Battalion (2nd Rhondda), the 14th (Service) Battalion (Swansea) and the 15th (Service) Battalion (Carmarthenshire) landed at Le Havre as part of the 114th Brigade in the 38th (Welsh) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 16th (Service) Battalion (Cardiff City) landed at Le Havre as part of the 115th Brigade in the 38th (Welsh) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 17th (Service) Battalion (1st Glamorgan) and 18th (Service) Battalion (2nd Glamorgan) (both &#x27;Bantam battalions&#x27;) landed in France as part of the 119th Brigade in the 40th Division in June 1916 for service on the Western Front. The 19th (Service) Battalion (Glamorgan Pioneers) landed at Le Havre as pioneer battalion to the 38th (Welsh) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 23rd (Service) Battalion (Welsh Pioneers) landed in Salonika as pioneer battalion to the 28th Division in July 1916.

====War memorial====

After the First World War, the regiment commissioned the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens to design a war memorial as a tribute to their fallen. The memorials was originally planned to be built on the Western Front in Belgium but was instead erected outside the regiment&#x27;s headquarters at Maindy Barracks in Cardiff. The memorial takes the form of squat cenotaph, following Lutyens&#x27; design of the famous Cenotaph on Whitehall in London.

===Inter-war===

The 2nd Battalion was deployed to Ireland in 1920 while the 1st Battalion returned to British India and served there until 1924 when it moved to Waziristan. The 2nd Battalion moved to Shanghai in 1927 for service with the Shanghai Defence Force and then on to India in 1935. The 6th (Glamorgan) Battalion of the Territorial Army, which had absorbed the 7th (Cyclist) Battalion in 1921, was converted into a searchlight regiment in 1938 and was transferred to the Royal Artillery as 67th (Welch) Searchlight Regiment in 1940.

===Second World War===

The 1st Battalion moved to Palestine in 1939 to play its part in operations connected with the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine. The battalion first saw action in the Western Desert Campaign of 1940. The 1st Battalion landed in Crete in February but was overwhelmed by the enemy in fighting at Souda Bay in Chania and Sphakia Beach and had to be evacuated by the Royal Navy. Eventually the 1st Battalion was reformed in Egypt and joined the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and moved back again to the Western Desert. In Crete alone the battalion had lost nearly 250 dead, with 400 being captured and the battalion was reduced to a mere 7 officers and 161 other ranks. They received a large draft of 700 officers and men. After heavy fighting in the area of Benghazi the 1st Battalion was again overrun in mid-1942 and again suffered heavy casualties when Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps swept through Cyrenaica and Libya in the First Battle of El Alamein. Following a period of rest and training in Egypt and the Sudan the 1st Battalion was re-organized in early 1943 as 34th (Welch) Beach Brick and in July landed with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, part of General Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s British Eighth Army, during the invasion of Sicily in July.

In May 1944 the 1st Battalion received large numbers of replacements from retrained anti-aircraft gunners of the Royal Artillery and became an effective infantry battalion again. The battalion was now assigned to 168th (London) Infantry Brigade, replacing the now disbanded 10th Royal Berkshire Regiment and serving alongside 1st London Irish Rifles and 1st London Scottish, making the brigade a mixture of Irish, Scottish and Welsh. The 168th Brigade was part of the 56th (London) Division, which had just been severely mauled fighting at Anzio. In July the battalion landed in Italy and fought in the Italian Campaign and would remain there for the rest of the war. They took part in heavy fighting on the Gothic Line, one of many German defensive lines in Italy, and in the Croce area where the battalion, and the rest of the 56th Division, suffered heavy casualties. As a result of the casualties sustained, and a severe shortage of British infantry replacements in the Mediterranean theatre, 168th Brigade was disbanded and the 1st Battalion was reduced to a small cadre of 5 officers and 60 other ranks. In March 1945 the 1st Battalion was transferred to the 1st Guards Brigade, serving alongside the 3rd Grenadier Guards and 3rd Welsh Guards and replacing the disbanded 3rd Coldstream Guards, part of 6th Armoured Division, and remained with it until the end of the war. In April they took part in Operation Grapeshot which ended with the capture of thousands of prisoners of war and the surrender of the German Army in Italy on 2 May.

The 2nd Battalion had been retained in India but in October 1944 the battalion moved to Burma as part of the 62nd Indian Infantry Brigade attached to the 19th Indian Infantry Division where it joined the British Fourteenth Army, led by Bill Slim. The Battalion saw its bitterest fighting along the Taungoo-Mawchi Road where for a hundred miles, with deep jungle on either side, the Japanese defended vigorously all the way. In November the battalion crossed the Chindwin River at Sittang, captured Pinlebu and saw some very hard fighting on the Swebo Plain.

The 4th Battalion was in Northern Ireland in the 160th Infantry Brigade attached to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division. In June 1944 the battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Coleman, was, after many years of training, ordered to France to join the British Second Army in the Normandy Campaign. From the start of the campaign the 4th Battalion was involved in fierce fighting during the Battle for Caen, and around the Falaise Pocket, the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of the Reichwald where it sustained very heavy casualties and involved some of the fiercest fighting in the North West Europe Campaign for British soldiers as they were up against determined German paratroopers.

Meanwhile, the 1/5th and 2/5th Battalions, mobilized at the same time as the 4th Battalion, were retained at home where the 2/5th also trained and prepared drafts for overseas although it remained at home throughout the whole war as a Home Defence battalion. The 1/5th Battalion, originally with the 160th Infantry Brigade, moved to Normandy in late June 1944 and fought alongside the 4th Battalion in the 53rd (Welsh) Division in the North West Europe Campaign distinguishing itself at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, the Falaise Gap, the Ardennes and the Reichwald Forest. In August 1944 the 1/5th Battalion was transferred from 160th Brigade to the 158th Infantry Brigade, still with 53rd (Welsh) Division. Some of the hardest fighting took place around the Falaise Gap where on 16 August 1944, near Balfour, Lieutenant Tasker Watkins of the 1/5th Battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross for supreme personal bravery and inspired leadership.

Around 1,100 officers and other ranks of the Welch Regiment were killed or died from wounds or sickness during the Second World War, with many more wounded.

===Post-war===
The 1st Battalion returned home in 1947 and was garrisoned at Malvern, Worcester, with the 2nd Battalion, which had returned from Burma. The 1st Battalion moved to Dering Lines in Brecon in February 1948 and amalgamated with the 2nd Battalion in June 1948. The Battalion moved to Sobraon Barracks in Colchester in October 1950 and was then deployed to Korea as part of the 29th British Infantry Brigade in the 1st Commonwealth Division in November 1951 for service in the Korean War.

The battalion moved to Hong Kong as part of the 27th Infantry Brigade in November 1952 and then returned home to Llanion Barracks in Pembroke Dock in 1954. It moved to Lüneburg in Germany as part of 10th Infantry Brigade in June 1956 before being deployed to Cyprus in October 1957. The battalion moved to North Africa in December 1958 and established its headquarters in Benghazi with company detachments at Derna, Marj and Al Adm and then returned to the United Kingdom the following year. The battalion was stationed at Brooke Barracks in Spandau from April 1961 where duties included guarding Rudolf Hess. The battalion returned to the United Kingdom and became the Demonstration Battalion of The School of Infantry, stationed first at Knook Camp in Heytesbury and then at the newly built Battlesbury Barracks in Warminster in 1965. For its final overseas posting the battalion moved to Stanley Fort on Hong Kong Island in June 1966. It then amalgamated with the South Wales Borderers to form the 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Wales in June 1969.

<doc id="1318099" wikidata="Q131315" url="?curid=1318099" title="Kronosaurus">
<text>Kronosaurus ( ) is an extinct genus of large short-necked pliosaur that lived during the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous in what is now Australia. The first known specimen was received in 1899 and consists of a partially preserved mandibular symphysis, which was first thought to come from an ichthyosaur according to Charles De Vis. However, it was 1924 that Albert Heber Longman formally described this specimen as the holotype of an imposing pliosaurid, to which he gave the scientific name K. queenslandicus, which is still the only recognized species nowadays. The genus name, meaning &quot;lizard of Kronos&quot;, refers to its large size and possible ferocity reminiscent of the Titan of the Greek mythology, while the species name alludes to Queensland, the Australian state of its discovery. In the early 1930s, the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology sent an organized expedition to Australia that recovered two specimens historically attributed to the taxon, including a well known skeleton that is now massively restored in plaster. Several attributed fossils were subsequently discovered, including two large, more or less partials skeletons. As the holotype specimen does not present diagnostics to concretely distinguish &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; from other pliosaurids, these same two skeletons are proposed as potential neotypes for future redescriptions. Two additional species were proposed, but these are now seen as unlikely or belonging to another genus.

&quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is one of the largest known pliosaurs identified to date. Initial estimates set its maximum size at around long based on the Harvard skeleton. However, the latter having been reconstructed with an exaggerated number of vertebrae, estimates published from the early 2000s reduce the size of the animal from to more than long. Like all plesiosaurs, &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; has four paddle-like limbs, a short tail and, like most pliosaurids, a long head and a short neck. The largest identified skulls of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; dwarf those of largest known theropod dinosaurs in size. The front of the skull is elongated into a rostrum (snout). The mandibular symphysis, where the front ends of each side of the mandible (lower jaw) fuse, is elongated in &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, and contains up to six pairs of teeth. The large cone-shaped teeth of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would have been used for a diet consisting of large prey. The front teeth are larger than the back teeth. The limbs of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; were modified into flippers, with the back pair larger than the front. The flippers would have given a wingspan of more than for the largest representatives.

Phylogenetic classifications published since 2013 recover &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; within the subfamily Brachaucheninae, a lineage which includes numerous pliosaurids that lived during different stages of the Cretaceous. Based on its stratigraphic distribution in the fossil record, &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; inhabited the Eromanga Sea, an ancient inland sea that covered a large part of Australia during the Early Cretaceous. This inner sea reached cold temperatures close to freezing. &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would likely have been an apex predator in this sea, with fossil evidence showing that it preyed on sea turtles and other plesiosaurs. Estimates of its bite force suggest that the animal would have reached between , surpassing the placoderm &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot; and rivaling &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, but being largely outnumbered by the megalodon. The skull of a juvenile specimen shows that it would have been attacked by an adult, indicating intraspecific aggression or even potential evidence of cannibalism within the genus. &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would have faced interspecific competition with other large predators within this sea, with one specimen attributed showing bite marks from a &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;-like shark.

==Research history==

===Initial finds and research===
In 1899, a partial fossil of a marine reptile was sent on behalf of a certain Andrew Crombie to the Queensland Museum of Brisbane, Australia, and was received by the zoologist Charles De Vis, who was then the director of the museum during that time. No information regarding the origin locality of the fossil is known, but it seems that it was probably discovered near of Hughenden, Queensland, a town from which Crombie comes. Queensland Museum records show that De Vis even sent a letter to Crombie informing him that he had been made aware of the receipt of the material. The fossil in question, cataloged as QM F1609, consists of a partial mandibular symphysis bearing six conical teeth. Based on his observations, De Vis considers the fossil to come from a representative of the Enaliosauria, a now obsolete taxon which included plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs. De Vis initially thought the specimen came from an ichthyosaur, specifically &quot;Ichthyosaurus australis&quot;, which today seems to be placed in the genus &quot;Platypterygius&quot;. However, the particular dentition of this specimen quickly makes it change its mind about whether it belongs to this specific genus. The fossil was officially described by De Vis&#x27;s successor, Albert Heber Longman, in a scientific article published in 1924 by the journal of the Queensland Museum. Longman deduces that the fossil comes from a large pliosaur, to which he gives the genus and species name &quot;Kronosaurus queenslandicus&quot;. The generic name comes from Kronos, a Titan from the Greek mythology, and from ancient Ancient Greek σαῦρος (&quot;saûros&quot;, &quot;lizard&quot;), to literally give &quot;lizard of Kronos&quot;. Longman would have created this generic name in reference to the imposing size and possible ferocity of the animal, which could recall the story of Kronos, who is known in Greek mythology for having devoured his own children, notably Zeus. The specific epithet &quot;queenslandicus&quot; is named after the Queensland, the Australian state where the holotype specimen was most likely discovered.

In August 1929, fifteen more or less partial fossils are discovered nearly 3.2 km south of Hughenden.
These same fossils, all catalogued as QM F2137, are identified as coming from the Toolebuc Formation, dating from the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous, the holotype having very probably also been discovered in this same locality. The majority of the material recovered is then very incomplete, the only two that can be concretely described being proximal parts of propodials (upper limb bones), which are analyzed in more detail the following year, and those again by Longman. In 1932, in an effort to make the animal&#x27;s fossils &quot;attractive&quot;, Longman published one of the oldest known reconstructions of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. The illustration was drawn in 1931 by a certain Wilfrid Morden, who was inspired in particular by the anatomical features of &quot;Peloneustes&quot; to fill in the still unknown parts of the animal. In May and April 1935, a certain J. Edgar Young for the Queensland Museum, collected several fossils from the Toolebuc Formation, more precisely from the Telemon station, about 30 km west of Hughenden. Among all the fossils Young was involved in exhuming are additional remains attributed to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, including the first somewhat more complete cranial parts identified within the genus. In his article published in October 1935, Longman, due to the high number of fossils, suggested that they came from at least two or three individuals. Noting that the fossils were not fully prepared at the time of his description, he describes them preliminary. The most notable specimen, cataloged as QM F2446, consists of a partial middle of the skull which preserves an occipital condyle, the back of the neurocranium, the external nostrils as well as the orbits.

===Harvard expedition===
In 1931, the Museum of Comparative Zoology sent an expedition to Australia with the dual aim of obtaining specimens of both living and extinct animals, and in particular marsupial mammals. This decision came from the fact that the museum had relatively few Australian animals and therefore wanted to collect more. It was then that the Harvard Australian Expedition began, and was undertaken by a team of six men. The team consisted of coleopterologist P. Jackson Darlington Jr., zoologist Glover Morrill Allen and his student Ralph Nicholson Ellis, chief physician Ira M. Dixon, paleontologist William E. Schevill, and their leader, entomologist William Morton Wheeler. The following year, in 1932, it was Schevill who acquired the title of expedition leader, making long journeys and recruiting local help when he could. The Queensland Museum was also invited to participate in this expedition, but this was never approved due to lack of funds and/or interest from the state government. However, Longman, who described the first known fossils of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, nevertheless assisted the expedition, storing specimens as they were sent to him, securing collecting permits, and maintaining correspondence with Schevill. Schevill then ventured into the Rolling Downs geological group, north of the town of Richmond, where he collected two large pliosaur specimens. These same specimens are collected from the Doncaster Member of the Wallumbilla Formation, dating back approximately 112 million years. The first specimen he exhumed, cataloged as MCZ 1284 and discovered on a property called Grampian Valley, consisted of a well-preserved piece of the anterior rostrum closely connected to the entire mandibular symphysis, in addition to several other fragmentary pieces.

The story regarding the discovery, exhumation and exhibition of the second specimen, cataloged as MCZ 1285, is much more detailed in many historical sources. This specimen was discovered long before the Harvard Expedition was even launched, by a rancher named Ralph William Haslam Thomas, in a locality known as Army Downs. The latter had been aware for many years of the presence of &quot;something strange coming out of the ground&quot; in a small horse enclosure. These &quot;strange things&quot; were actually a row of vertebrae contained in nodules. Noticing his discovery, Thomas therefore informed the members of the Harvard expedition, and notably Schevill. The latter then contacts a British migrant trained in the use of explosives, nicknamed &quot;The Maniac&quot; by local residents, in order to extract the specimen of of rock which constitutes its geological matrix. When the specimen was unearthed, its fossils were then sent to the United States in 86 crates weighing a total of . According to the export permit, the specimen was transported aboard the &quot;SS Canadian Constructor&quot; around 1 December 1932. Once arrived at Harvard, the fossils, which represent approximately 60% of the skeleton, took several years to extract from the limestone because of the lack of money, manpower and space within the museum. One year earlier, in 1934, Schevill asked Longman to send a cast of the holotype mandibular symphysis for comparison with the new specimen. It was then Longman&#x27;s assistant, a certain Tom Marshall, who took it upon himself to make Schevill&#x27;s request. The researchers then realized that the characters of the holotype (QM F1609) were identical to those of the Harvard specimen (MCZ 1285). Longman, in his letters to Schevill, suggests that he would have enjoyed seeing the specimen during its preparation in the late 1930s, but he never left Australian territory. A first scientific description of the skull was made by Theodore E. White in 1935, before it began to be exhibited in the museum four years later, in 1939.

The rest of the skeleton was kept in the basement of the museum for more than fifteen years. This interim period ended when the fossils attracted the attention of Godfrey Lowell Cabot, a Boston industrialist, philanthropist and founder of the Cabot Corporation. Cabot&#x27;s family had a history of sighting large sea snakes in the coastal waters around the town he is from. When questioning the museum&#x27;s director, Alfred Sherwood Romer, about the existence and reports of sea serpents, it occurred to Romer to tell Cabot about the skeleton kept in the museum&#x27;s basement. So Cabot asks about the cost of a restoration and Romer says &quot;about $10,000&quot;. Romer may not have been serious, but Cabot clearly was because the check for said sum came shortly after. Given that Romer&#x27;s primary interest was the study of non-mammalian synapsids, it is possible that he had little regard for the skeleton as a subject of scientific study. After two years of careful preparations with chisel and acid by Arnold Lewis and James A. Jensen under Romer&#x27;s direction, their work ultimately cost slightly more than promised by Cabot&#x27;s base check. The Harvard skeleton was exhibited for the first time on 10 June 1958, and is followed by a detailed scientific description carried out by Romer and Lewis, which was published the following year by the museum journal. When the finalization of the specimen was announced in the Australian press, Longman, who is the descriptor of the taxon, was not mentioned. In response, professor and geologist Walter Heywood Bryan sent a message via telegraph informing journalists that it would be regrettable if such an important announcement made no mention of Longman and the interpretation of the initially fragmentary fossil material. At the age of 93, Thomas, the original discoverer of the specimen, was able to see the mounted skeleton of what he considered &quot;his dinosaur&quot;, as well as meet again the leader of the museum&#x27;s former expedition, each believing that the other had been dead for a long time.

The arrival of new knowledge in the field of paleontology subsequently calls into question the restoration of the skeleton as proposed by Romer. Indeed, because of many incomplete bones, the latter ordered Lewis and Jensen to add plaster where he deemed it necessary. This latest decision has made it difficult for paleontologists to access real fossils, to the point where some of them use the humoristic nickname &quot;Plasterosaurus&quot; to refer to the specimen. In addition, it seems that the skeleton was reconstructed with the wrong proportions. According to Australian paleontologist Colin McHenry, the specimen has eight extra vertebrae added to the spine and the skull is not supposed to have a bulbous shaped sagittal crest on top. In his thesis revising the genus &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; published in 2009, McHenry called the Harvard skeleton &quot;a rather disappointing restoration of what must have been an excellent fossil specimen&quot;. For this reason, many researchers express their desire to analyze real fossils using CT scans.

===Later discoveries and genus validity===
Given that the holotype specimen of &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot; (QM F1609) is fragmentary and does not present any unique characteristics that would qualify the genus as distinct from other pliosaurs, the validity of this taxon has therefore been questioned. As early as 1962, Samuel Paul Welles considered &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; as a &quot;nomen vanum&quot; and recommended the designation of a neotype specimen from Harvard University which would preserve the genus validity. From 1979, a good number of fossils from large pliosaurs were discovered in various localities in Australia, mainly in the geological strata of the Toolebuc Formation, the formation from which the first fossils attributed to the genus were discovered. In other formations, only one additional attributed specimen was discovered in the Doncaster Member of the Wallumbilla Formation, while three specimens, including one attributed to the type species, were discovered in the Allaru Formation. Two specimens with no specific affiliation were identified in the Bulldog Shale. In his 2009 thesis, McHenry describes in detail many fossils attributed to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, including most of the new specimens that he judges to possibly belong to this genus. Of the numerous fossil specimens that he analyzed, McHenry proposed that two partial skeletons, cataloged as QM F10113 and QM F18827, which both come from the Toolebuc Formation, could be candidate neotypes, because they present features that seem to fit with the holotype. However, no formal ICZN petition to designate a neotype was submitted. In 2022, Leslie Francis Noè and Marcela Gómez-Pérez published a study that revised most of the specimens historically attributed to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. Both authors limit &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; only to the holotype and consider it a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. The holotype specimen does not possess any features allowing a diagnostic, the other attributed fossils are provisionally moved to a new taxon that the two authors name &quot;Eiectus longmani&quot;, in homage to Longman, the paleontologist who named the original genus. The Harvard skeleton (MCZ 1285) is also designated a holotype of this same genus. 

In 2023, Valentin Fischer and colleagues criticized the reassignments even under these circumstances, predicting that they stand contrary to ICZN Articles 75.5 and 75.6 and that the aforementioned multiple-species possibility cannot justify a tentative reassignment of all specimens to &quot;Eiectus&quot;. The authors instead opted to refer to all relevant fossils as &quot;Kronosaurus-Eiectus&quot;. The same year, Stephen F. Poropat and colleagues maintained &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot; as a nominally valid taxon that includes all fossils from the Toolebuc and Allaru Formation pending an official ICZN petition, recommending specimen QM F18827 as neotype. The authors also criticize the repurposing of Toolebuc specimens, on the grounds that Noè and Gómez-Pérez presumably ignored the conclusion of McHenry&#x27;s 2009 thesis that only one species of large pliosaur exists in the formation and that, therefore, all of its specimens can be reliably considered conspecific to the holotype. As for &quot;Eiectus&quot;, Poropat and colleagues limit it only to MCZ 1285 and the referred specimen MCZ 1284, but their assignment without formal redescription also remains subject to debate, given that the holotype is so massively restored with plaster that all features apparent diagnostics are probably unreliable without comprehensive CT scans.

===Species proposed or formerly classified===
Although the only currently recognized species of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot;, several authors have suggested the existence of additional species within the genus. In 1982 and again in 1991, Ralph Molnar expressed doubts as to whether the Harvard skeleton (MCZ 1285) belonged to the species &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot;, given that it was discovered in a locality distinct from that of the first known specimens, namely in the older Wallumbilla Formation. The author therefore suggests that this specimen would belong to another species of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; characterized by a deeper and more robust skull than those coming from the Toolebuc Formation. A study published in 1993 also attributes the specimen under the name &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; sp., the authors following the same opinion as Molnar. However, as White indicates in his description of the specimen in 1935, much of the skull roof is not preserved and is mostly restored in plaster, the real proportions being therefore uncertain. In his 2009 thesis, McHenry nevertheless continues to refer the specimen to &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot; because of its taphonomic distribution and certain traits which may be consistent with other specimens discovered in the Toolebuc Formation. To determine whether this statement is true, only a CT scan could reveal the presence of the true notable differences within this reconstructed plaster specimen.

In 1977, an almost complete skeleton of a large pliosaur was discovered by local residents of the town of Villa de Leyva, Colombia. The specimen, nicknamed &quot;El Fósil&quot; and dating from the Upper Aptian of the Paja Formation, was first provisionally referred to the genus &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; two years later, in 1979. It was in 1992 that the German paleontologist Olivier Hampe established a second species of the genus under the name of &quot;K. boyacensis&quot;, the specific name referring to Boyacá, the department surrounding the discovery site. However, these descriptions were made from photographs and remote imaging techniques, in particular because access to the specimen was prohibited by the local community. In addition, the state of preservation of the specimen and anatomical characteristics different from those of &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot; also suggested doubts about the affiliation of this species to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. It was therefore in 2022 that Noè and Gómez-Pérez re-described this specimen and discovered that it belonged to a distinct genus, which they named &quot;Monquirasaurus&quot;, in reference to Monquirá, the administrative division where the specimen was discovered.

==Description==
Due to the fact that the holotype specimen of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is non-diagnostic, the majority of anatomical descriptions are based on observations made from more complete fossils later assigned to the genus. The majority of descriptions come from McHenry&#x27;s thesis published in 2009, although some specimens have been described in other works. &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; has a morphology typical of the pliosaurids of the thalassophonean group, which has a large elongated skull connected to a short neck, unlike many other plesiosaurs, which have a long neck and a small head. Like all other plesiosaurs, &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; has a short tail, a massive trunk and two pairs of large flippers.

===Size===
&quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is one of the largest pliosaurs identified to date, but several estimates as to its exact size have been proposed during research. As early as 1930, Longman, in his description of propodiums, considered that &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would have exceeded in size the imposing &quot;Megalneusaurus&quot;, a North American pliosaurid dating from the Late Jurassic. After the collection of fossils assigned to the genus by the Harvard Expedition, the maximum size of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; was generally set at long,based on specimen MCZ 1285. &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; was then considered as being the largest known marine reptile until 1995, when Theagarten Lingham-Soliar suggested that the Late Cretaceous aquatic squamate &quot;Mosasaurus hoffmannii&quot; would reach around long, the latter having a reduced size to around according to more recent estimates. Currently, the largest marine reptile identified to date is the Late Triassic ichthyosaur &quot;Ichthyotitan&quot;, which is thought to have reached around in length. The Harvard skeleton restoration being erroneous, McHenry gives a smaller size of this specimen between long for a weight of . These same measurements are seen as the maximum possible estimates of the genus as a whole. Even before McHenry&#x27;s thesis was published, paleontologist Benjamin P. Kear and marine biologist Richard Ellis proposed comparable estimates in their respective works both published in 2003, ranging from according to Kear at according to Ellis. In 2024, Ruizhe Jackevan Zhao revises the measurements of MCZ 1285 at .

Other specimens have been given body estimates although some of these are only known from more limited fossil remains. QM F1609, the holotype specimen, although very fragmentary, would have measured long with a body mass of . The proposed neotype specimen QM F18827 would have reached a length of with a body mass of . The most complete known attributed specimen, QM F10113, would have reached slightly smaller measurements, namely long with a body mass of . The largest specimens of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; having been discovered in the Toolebuc Formation, QM F2446 and QM F2454, would have reached measurements almost identical to that of the Harvard skeleton. Respectively, these two specimens would have reached in length with body masses estimated at .

===Skull===
Since the holotype of &quot;K. queenslandicus&quot; (QM F1609) consists of only a partial mandibular symphysis, very little can be said about it. However, more complete fossil skulls that are assigned to the taxon show unique traits. The skulls of various known specimens of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; vary in size. The holotype, which although partial and fragmentary, comes from a skull which would have measured a total of long. Candidate neotype specimens QM F10113 and QM F18827 have cranial lengths reaching , respectively. The skull of the Harvard skeleton is estimated to be long. The cranial measurements of the last three specimens previously cited surpass in size the skull of any known theropod dinosaurs. The snout and the mandibular rostrum are long and narrow in shape. The rostrum in general appears to be arched in shape and is relatively elongated, possessing a distinct median and dorsal crest. The eye sockets face obliquely posteriorly, where they are located laterally on the anterior half of the skull. The temporal fossae (openings in the top back of the cranium) are very large, but the skull does not have an anterior interpterygoid vacuity. 

One of the many traits identified as unique in &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is that the premaxilla (front upper tooth-bearing bone) has four instead of five or more caniniform teeth. The frontal bones (bones bordering the eye sockets) do not come into contact with the margin of the eye sockets due to the connection between the postfrontal and prefrontal bones. The frontal bones also do not come into contact with the middle part of the skull roof due to the connection between the parietal bones and posterior facial processes of the premaxillae. The prefrontals are large and contact the anteromedial part of the eye sockets as well as the posterior border of the nostrils. The lacrimal bones (bones bordering the lower front edges of the eye sockets) are present in small specimens, but tend to be fused in adults. The dorsal surface of the median dorsal crest is formed by the premaxillae and nasal bones (bones bordering the external nares), which in adults are fused. The hyoid bones are robust.

The mandibular symphysis of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is elongated and spatulate (spoon-shaped), and like its close relatives &quot;Brachauchenius&quot; and &quot;Megacephalosaurus&quot;, it contains up to six pairs of teeth. Each dentary (the tooth-bearing bone in the mandible) has up to 26 teeth. The mandibular glenoid (socket of the jaw joint) is kidney-shaped and angled upwards and inwards. The main autapomorphy of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; teeth is that they are conical in shape, roughly ridged, and lacking distinct carinae. The dentition of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is heterodont, that is, it has teeth of different shapes. The larger teeth are caniniform and located at the front of the jaws, while the smaller teeth are more sharply recurved, stouter, and located further back.

===Postcranial skeleton===
The Harvard skeleton historically attributed to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; received a study detailing its postcranial anatomy by Romer and Lewis in 1959. However, as the latter was massively restored in plaster, it is currently difficult to discern the real fossil material. Additionally, the specimen is temporarily referred to &quot;Eiectus&quot;; CT scans may in time reveal whether or not the specimen belongs to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. Many &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; specimens preserve postcranial material. The most complete specimen known, catalogued as QM F10113, preserves an important part of the postcranial anatomy which could reveal important information for a more in-depth diagnosis of the taxon. This same specimen should also be described in more detail in a future study. Some features concerning the postcranial anatomy of the genus have however been noted, both in McHenry&#x27;s thesis and in other articles.

Based on the different specimens analyzed, McHenry estimates that &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would have had at least 35 presacral vertebrae, including thirteen cervical and five pectoral vertebra. Unlike &quot;Pliosaurus&quot;, the cervical centra (vertebral bodies) are wider than the dorsals. The anterior dorsal vertebrae are higher than wide. The zygapophyses would have been visibly absent from the anterior dorsal vertebrae and in the caudal vertebrae. In the thoracic region, the ribs would have been robust, as suggested by the transverse processes which are equally robust. The ribs would also been single-headed. Although the tail of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is unknown from articulated specimens, the end of the caudal vertebrae would have supported a small caudal fin like in other plesiosaurs. The coracoid and pubis are both elongated from front to back. The hindlimbs of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; are longer than its forelimbs, with the femur being longer and more robust than the humerus. This suggests that the largest representatives of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would have rear flippers which would have formed a wingspan exceeding .

==Classification and evolution==
De Vis initially suggested that the &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; holotype specimen belonged to an ichthyosaur. However, when Longman described the taxon in 1924, he assigned it to the family Pliosauridae based on multiple anatomical features, an affiliation which will be mainly recognized throughout the 20th century as well as in the 21st century by the scientific community. However, some alternative classifications have been proposed throughout research. For example, in 1962, Welles suggested that &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; possibly belonged to the family Dolichorhynchopidae. However, this family is today recognized as polyphyletic (unnatural grouping) and is seen as invalid.

The exact phylogenetic positioning of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; within the Pliosauridae has also been debated. In 1992, Hampe proposed to classify &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; with its close relative &quot;Brachauchenius&quot; in the proposed family Brachaucheniidae. Kenneth Carpenter agreed with Hampe in 1996, although noting some notable cranial differences between the two genera. The family Brachaucheniidae was originally erected in 1925 by Samuel Wendell Williston to include only &quot;Brachauchenius&quot;. In 2001, F. Robin O&#x27;Keefe revised the classification of Pliosauridae and classified &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; as a basal representative distantly related to &quot;Brachauchenius&quot;. In 2008, two studies and a thesis proposed alternative classifications for &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. Patrick S. Druckenmiller and Anthony P. Russell classified &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; as a derived pliosaurid, Hilary F. Ketchum still classifying it as a sister taxon of &quot;Brachauchenius&quot; in this family. Adam S. Smith and Gareth J. Dyke reclassify both genera within the Brachaucheniidae, but the family is seen as the sister taxon of the Pliosauridae. McHenry suggests that if Ketchum&#x27;s proposal is proved as valid, then it would be preferable to relegate Brachaucheniidae as a subfamily of the Pliosauridae, therefore being renamed Brachaucheninae. McHenry nevertheless maintains the name Brachaucheniidae in his thesis detailing in more detail &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; pending further phylogenetic results. In 2013, Roger B. S. Benson and Druckenmiller named a new clade within Pliosauridae, Thalassophonea. This clade included the &quot;classic&quot;, short-necked pliosaurids while excluding the earlier, long-necked, more gracile forms. The authors thus move the family Brachaucheniidae as a subfamily, renaming it Brachaucheninae, and classify many Cretaceous pliosaurids there, including &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. Within this subfamily, &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; appears to be one of the most derived representatives, being generally placed in a clade including &quot;Brachauchenius&quot; and more recently &quot;Megacephalosaurus&quot;. Subsequent studies have uncovered a similar position for &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;.

The cladogram below is modified from Madzia &quot;et al.&quot; (2018):

The Brachaucheninae subfamily brings together the majority of pliosaurids dating from the Cretaceous, with phylogenetic analyzes often uniting them within this clade. However, it is possible that this is not the only lineage of thalassophoneans to have survived after the Jurassic. Indeed, Lower Cretaceous pliosaur teeth, displaying characteristics distinct from the Brachaucheninae, suggest that at least one other lineage crossed the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. Members of the Brachaucheninae are variable and only one uniting characteristic between all is known; the possession of somewhat circularly-shaped teeth rather than full or somewhat trihedral-shaped teeth seen in some Jurassic pliosaurs. Some characteristics that are shared by most brachauchenines like &quot;Megacephalosaurus&quot; includes skull features (such as an elongated snout, gracile rostrum, and consistently sized teeth) that are better adapted for a general evolutionary shift towards smaller prey. However, there are notable exceptions such as &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, which has teeth that are each shaped differently. &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is one of the few representatives of this group who not share any of these traits, having differently shaped teeth. This type of dentition therefore indicates that &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; was a genus specialized in hunting large prey, unlike most other representatives of this group.

==Paleobiology==
Plesiosaurs were well-adapted to marine life. They grew at rates comparable to those of birds and had high metabolisms, indicating homeothermy or even endothermy. The possibility of endothermy is also very probable in plesiosaurs that lived in Australia, including &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, the southernmost areas having had particularly cold temperatures. A 2019 study by palaeontologist Corinna Fleischle and colleagues found that plesiosaurs had enlarged red blood cells, based on the morphology of their vascular canals, which would have aided them while diving. The short tail, while unlikely to have been used to propel the animal, could have helped stabilise or steer the plesiosaur.

===Feeding===
Due to its imposing size, morphology and distribution, &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would most likely have been the apex predator of the ancient Eromanga inland sea. Stomach contents have been found in some &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; specimens. The most notable of these is specimen QM F10113, the most complete known, which contains the remains of a sea turtle. The position of the turtle at the skeletal level indicates that the specimen died of suffocation after swallowing its prey. The fossil remains are too fragmentary to determine what genus this turtle belongs to, but its measurements are similar to the protostegid &quot;Notochelone&quot;, which is the most widespread sea turtle of the Albian strata of Queensland. In 1993, Tony Thulborn and Susan Turner analyzed the severely crushed skull of an elasmosaurid, which is today recognized as belonging to &quot;Eromangasaurus&quot;. In their study, the authors discovered the presence of multiple bite marks made by large teeth. These same traces correspond to the dentition of the specimens referred to its contemporary &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, proving its predation towards this animal. This is also the first reported evidence of a pliosaur attack on an elasmosaurid. Elasmosaurids having a very elongated neck and a small head, the injuries found in &quot;Eromangasaurus&quot; suggest that &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; would have regularly attacked this region of the body. Although no direct fossil evidence of feeding is known, the animal would likely also have preyed on leptocleidids.

===Intraspecific combat===
The smallest specimen attributed to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, cataloged as QM F51291, shows bite marks on its skull. In his 2009 thesis, McHenry highlights that the maximum possible size of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is , and suggests that the three known specimens not reaching the minimum size of represent juveniles or subadults. After analysis, he therefore suggests that this specimen would have been a juvenile which would have been fatally killed by the bite of an adult, indicating an intraspecific aggression or even cannibalism in &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. He supports this hypothesis on the basis of common observations of many adult crocodilians not hesitating to attack juveniles. However, McHenry suggests that it is also possible that the bites would have been made shortly after the specimen died of another cause.

===Bite force===

A large part of McHenry&#x27;s 2009 thesis is dedicated to the bite force of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; using biomechanical analyses. Using these techniques, McHenry discovered that &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; exceeded the bite force of any living animal, itself being only slightly surpassed in some estimates by the well kown theropod dinosaur &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Based on specimen QM F10113, the bite force of &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is estimated to be between . Still based on the same specimen, a 2014 Foffa &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) reestimates the bite force at between , corresponding to its close Jurassic relative &quot;Pliosaurus kevani&quot;. The estimates of this study regarding the bite force of these two pliosaurids exceed that of the predatory placoderm fish &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot; but are far from equaling that of the megalodon, to which the latter would have reached between .

==Paleoecology==
===Contemporaneous biota===
All the geological formations from which fossils attributed to &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; have been discovered are located in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB). During the Lower Cretaceous, this geographical area was flooded by an inland sea known as the Eromanga Sea. The sedimentary record shows that this sea was relatively shallow, muddy and stagnant. Temperatures in this sea would have been particularly cold, approaching near freezing, and seasonal ice may have formed in some areas. Sea temperatures during the Albian would nevertheless have been warmer than during the Aptian.

Many invertebrates are known from the fossil record dating from the Late Aptian to Late Albian of the GAB, mainly represented by molluscs. Free-swimming organisms include cephalopods, which include many ammonites, belemnites, and squids. Benthic zones are mainly dominated by bivalves, with gastropods and scaphopods being less diverse. Other types of invertebrates are known, such as crinoid echinoderms, decapod crustaceans, brachiopods, polychaete annelids and one species of glass sponge. The diversification of fish within the Eromanga Sea seems to vary according to geological periods, since they are not very present in the Albian strata but are abundant in the Aptian archives, particularly in the Upper Aptian. These include actinopterygians such as &quot;Australopachycormus&quot;, &quot;Richmondichthys&quot; &quot;Flindersichthys&quot;, &quot;Cooyoo&quot; and &quot;Pachyrhizondontus&quot;. The only known sarcopterygians are the lungfish &quot;Ceratodus&quot; and &quot;Neoceratodus&quot;. Chondrichthyans are also present, represented by &quot;Archaeolamna&quot;, &quot;Carcharias&quot;, &quot;Cretolamna&quot;, &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;, &quot;Edaphodon&quot;, &quot;Echinorhinus&quot;, &quot;Leptostyrax&quot;, &quot;Microcorax&quot;, &quot;Notorynchus&quot;, &quot;Pseudocorax&quot;, &quot;Pristiophorus&quot;, &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot; and several species of orectolobiforms and palaeospinacids. These fish include surface-dwelling, midwater, and benthic varieties of various sizes, some of which could get quite large. They filled a variety of niches, including invertebrate eaters, piscivores, and, in the case of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;, large apex predators.

The Eromanga Sea is known for its great diversification of marine reptiles. Identified marine turtles include the protostegids &quot;Cratochelone&quot;, &quot;Bouliachelys&quot; and &quot;Notochelone&quot;, this latter being the most diverse within the inland sea. Several ichthyosaur fossils have been discovered in Queensland and were historically assigned to several different genera. We now know that these fossils probably belong to the species &quot;Platypterygius australis&quot;, which is one of the youngest ichthyosaurs known in the fossil record. Other fossils attributable to this species have been discovered in other formations of the GAB, notably in the Bulldog Shale, but they prove to be too fragmentary to determine a clear diagnostic. Several plesiosaurians have been identified, but most fossils are either too fragmentary or non-diagnostic for them to be assigned to a specific genus or species. &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is stratigraphically the most widespread plesiosaurian in Australia, and would be the only large representative of a pliosaurid known to date in the country, if we exclude the proposed genus &quot;Eiectus&quot;. The only known cryptoclidid is &quot;Opallionectes&quot;. Elasmosaurids include &quot;Eromangasaurus&quot; and numerous interminate representatives. Some representatives of the Leptocleidia clade, which includes Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, are known. Leptocleids include &quot;Leptocleidus&quot;, &quot;Umoonasaurus&quot;, and a few specimens with undetermined attributions. Polycotylids are only known from undetermined or not yet described specimens, the most notable of them the Richmond specimen.

Some archosaurs from various groups have also been identified in the fossil record of the Eromanga Sea. Numerous fragmentary remains of dinosaurs from specimens that probably perished after drowning in the waters of Eromanga are known, these being identified as coming from the sauropod &quot;Austrosaurus&quot;, the ankylosaurian &quot;Minmi&quot; and the ornithopod &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;. In addition to dinosaurs, many pterosaur fossils are known, and these could have been predators comparable to many modern-day seabirds. However, theirs fossils are often fragmentary, and few taxa have been named. Among the erected genera, there are &quot;Aussiedraco&quot;, &quot;Mythunga&quot; and &quot;Thapunngaka&quot;.

===Interspecific competition===
Despite its status as an apex predator, &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; was sometimes attacked by other contemporary predators. Indeed, a mandible cataloged as KK F0630, possibly representing a large subadult or a small adult specimen, shows bite marks which would have been made by lamniform sharks belonging to the Cretoxyrhinidae family. Injuries of this type are not unlikely, as several sharks attributed to this family have been identified in various geological formations where &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; is known. The grooves showing the bite marks being surrounded by aberrant raised osseous growth indicate that the specimen would have healed during its lifetime.

<text>Gilbert Wakefield (1756–1801) was an English scholar and controversialist. He moved from being a cleric and academic, into tutoring at dissenting academies, and finally became a professional writer and publicist. In a celebrated state trial, he was imprisoned for a pamphlet critical of government policy of the French Revolutionary Wars; and died shortly after his release.

==Early life and background==
He was born 22 February 1756 in Nottingham, the third son of the Rev. George Wakefield, then rector of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Nottingham but afterwards at Kingston-upon-Thames, and his wife Elizabeth. He was one of five brothers, who included George, a merchant in Manchester.

His father was from Rolleston, Staffordshire, and came to Cambridge in 1739 as a sizar. He had support in his education from the Hardinge family, of Melbourne, Derbyshire, his patrons being Nicholas Hardinge and his physician brother. In his early career he was chaplain to Margaret Newton, in her own right 2nd Countess Coningsby. George Hardinge, son of Nicholas, after Gilbert&#x27;s death pointed out that the living of Kingston passed to George Wakefield in 1769, under an Act of Parliament specifying presentations to chapels of the parish, only because he had used his personal influence with his uncle Charles Pratt, 1st Baron Camden the Lord Chancellor, and Jeremiah Dyson.

==Education and Fellowship==
Wakefield had some schooling in the Nottingham area, under Samuel Berdmore and then at Wilford under Isaac Pickthall. He then made good progress at Kingston Free School under Richard Wooddeson the elder (died 1774), father of Richard Wooddeson the jurist.

Wakefield was sent to university young, because Wooddeson was retiring from teaching. An offer came of a place at Christ Church, Oxford, from the Rev. John Jeffreys (1718–1798); but his father turned it down. He went to Jesus College, Cambridge on a scholarship founded by Robert Marsden: the Master Lynford Caryl was from Nottinghamshire, and a friend of his father. He matriculated in 1772, and graduated B.A. as second wrangler in 1776. He was a Fellow of the college from 1776 to 1779, and was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1778.

Wakefield associated with John Jebb and Robert Tyrwhitt. William Bennet, senior tutor of Emmanuel College, became a long-term friend from this time, as Wakefield put it in 1799, &quot;amidst all the differences of opinion&quot;.

The Rev. George Wakefield died in 1776, aged 56. The situation of Gilbert&#x27;s younger brother Thomas, then still an undergraduate at Jesus College but also ordained priest and a curate to his father at Kingston, was anomalous, at least in the view of George Hardinge. His younger brother Henry Hardinge, at this point signed up at Peterhouse but yet to matriculate, became vicar of Kingston in 1778. Thomas Wakefield was at St Mary Magdalene, Richmond for the rest of his life, dying in 1806; and Gilbert was buried there. In the first edition of his autobiography, Gilbert was critical of Hardinge&#x27;s legal moves to dislodge Thomas from this Richmond chapel, to which the presentation had been with his father (under Act of Parliament). The matter ended up in the Court of Common Pleas, which ruled for Thomas Wakefield. The 1802 edition tacitly omitted slurs to which Hardinge objected. Hardinge blamed an unnamed malevolent person, and his parting shot was that Thomas as a boy &quot;had been intended for trade&quot;.

==Curacies==
In 1778, Wakefield was a curate at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Stockport, under the Rev. John Watson, an antiquarian. He was interested in becoming head of Brewood School, but baulked at again signing up to the 39 Articles.

Wakefield then was a curate in Liverpool. There he preached on abolitionism, and against privateering, which was badly received at this time in the Anglo-French War (1778–1783). He commented in his autobiography that Liverpool was the &quot;headquarters&quot; of the Atlantic slave trade, that the American Revolutionary War with the French war impeded slaving, and the upsurge with privateering, which he saw as aggravating war, was a consequence.

From 1778, Wakefield began to question the scriptural foundation of the orthodox teaching of the Church of England; and he expressed political views by modifying the language in prayers he read in Liverpool against the American revolutionaries. He married in 1779, bringing his fellowship to an end.

==Dissenting tutor==
Wakefield left the ministry, and in mid-1779 became classical tutor at Warrington Academy, recommended by Jebb. The Academy closed in 1783, in Wakefield&#x27;s view from financial troubles. He commented also that at least a third of the students during his time there were from Church of England families, rather than being from a dissenting background.

Wakefield&#x27;s theology had become a nonconforming Unitarianism. John Hunt in his &quot;Religious Thought in England&quot; classed him with Edward Evanson, among prominent Unitarians leaving the Church of England, and as having in common that &quot;they can scarcely be regarded as representing anybody but themselves&quot;. He had attracted the attention of Theophilus Lindsey; who made qualifications of his approval of someone he considered a &quot;true scholar&quot;. In 1783 Lindsey explained to William Turner his reasons for not supporting Wakefield as a replacement for the ailing William Leechman at Glasgow. Wakefield at Warrington still attended services of the Church of England; and he hoped &quot;time will mellow his dispositions, and lessen the high opinion he has of himself&quot;.

Robert Malthus, a pupil of Wakefield at the Academy, continued with him for a year after the Warrington closure. Residing at Bramcote outside Nottingham, and then in Richmond, Surrey where his brother Thomas was at St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s chapel, Wakefield found no more students. At the chapel, on the day in 1784 appointed for a thanksgiving for the end of the American war, he preached an anti-colonial sermon. It was quoted by Thomas Clarkson in his history of abolitionism, together with accounts of two contemporary works, the &quot;Essays, Historical and Moral&quot; of George Gregory, and the &quot;Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of the African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies&quot; by James Ramsay.

Wakefield lived in Nottingham from 1784 to 1790. Here he was able to find private pupils. One was Robert Hibbert, from a slave-holding family in Jamaica, who went on to Cambridge. He was a Unitarian, on good terms with William Frend, and founded the Hibbert Trust. He was also at odds with his cousin George Hibbert. George Hibbert was Wakefield&#x27;s patron, whom Wakefield thanked in his autobiography; but it was Robert who gave financial support when he was imprisoned.

In 1790, Wakefield was appointed to the New College, Hackney, where Thomas Belsham had been recruited the year before, and Joseph Priestley arrived the year after. It was a contentious trio of hirings. Wakefield&#x27;s application was strengthened by a character reference from George Walker, minister at the High Pavement Chapel in Nottingham and a friend.

Among Wakefield&#x27;s pupils at Hackney was John Jones. His time at the New College was short: he left in 1791, on the grounds of disillusion with public worship. The subsequent controversy showed Wakefield in &quot;one of the most extreme positions&quot; maintained in Rational Dissent.

==Writer and pamphleteer==
Wakefield from then on lived by his pen, and was a prolific author. He was a passionate defender of the French Revolution. The final issue, in 1798, of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot; contained a satirical poem &quot;New Morality&quot;, calling on opposition newspapers, poets and radicals including John Thelwall, Priestley and Wakefield to &quot;praise Lepaux&quot;, i.e. Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux, a leader of the French Directory.

William Burdon replied to a remark of Thomas James Mathias:

Whenever I think of the name of Gilbert Wakefield, and look at the list of his works, (for I would not undertake to read them &quot;all&quot;), I feel alternate sorrow and indignation. 

Burdon wrote:

To the name and character of Gilbert Wakefield, I am desirous to shew every possible respect, as a zealous, though sometimes an imprudent defender of the rights of human nature.

In 1794, Wakefield expressed admiration for the Manchester radical Thomas Walker. Acquainted socially, they were both guests at a London radical dinner given on 3 January 1795 by Thomas Northmore, others there being John Disney, William Godwin, Thomas Brand Hollis and &quot;Bard&quot; Iolo Morganwg.

Of the 1798 quickly-written wartime squib that provoked a prosecution of Wakefield, Marilyn Butler wrote:

Very lively and very impertinent, Wakefield&#x27;s pamphlet exemplified both the ability of radical writers to make a point, and their alienation from the temper of the mass of the British people in a national crisis.

===Pamphlets of the 1790s===
*&quot;An Enquiry into the Expediency and Propriety of Public or Social Worship&quot; (1791). There were replies from Joseph Priestley, Anna Barbauld, Eusebia (Mary Hays); John Disney, James Wilson (M.A. Glasgow) of Stockport; John Bruckner; Thomas Jervis and others. Wakefield answered Priestley.
* &quot;Evidences of Christianity&quot; 1793
*&quot;The Spirit of Christianity, Compared with the Spirit of the Times in Great Britain&quot; (1794). There was an anonymous reply &quot;Vindiciae Britannicae&quot; in the Revolution Controversy, arguing in defence of the status quo in the British constitution, by &quot;An Under Graduate&quot; (identified as William Penn (1776–1845), son of Richard Penn, matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge 1795.).
*&quot;Remarks on the General Orders of the Duke of York to his Army on June 7, 1794&quot; (1794)

There were related replies from Thomas Belsham and Joshua Toulmin. The nonconformist John Watkins wrote in support of Wilberforce, as did the Anglican Rev. George Hutton in 1798.
*&quot;A letter to Sir J. Scott, his Majesty&#x27;s Attorney-General, on the subject of a late Trial at Guildhall&quot; (1798). Addressed to Sir John Scott. On the trial of the radical booksellers Joseph Johnson and J. S. Jordan for seditious libel, and liberty of the press according to commentary in the &quot;Analytical Review&quot;.
*&quot;The Defence of Gilbert Wakefield, B.A.&quot; (1799)

==Imprisonment and death==

The controversial pamphlet &quot;A Reply to some Parts of the Bishop of Landaff&#x27;s Address&quot; (1798) saw both Wakefield and his publisher, Joseph Johnson, taken to court for seditious libel. A work alluding to the concentration of poverty in the area centred on Hackney, it was written in response to &quot;An Address to the People of Great Britain&quot; (1798), by Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff. Watson argued that national taxes should be raised to pay for the war against France and to reduce the national debt.

For selling the &quot;Reply&quot;, Johnson was fined £50 and sentenced to six months imprisonment in King&#x27;s Bench Prison in February 1799. Later in the year, Wakefield appeared before Lord Kenyon in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, conducting his own defence, with Sir John Scott. His trial followed on directly after that of the bookseller John Cuthell, with the same jury. Much of the prosecution case was read from the &quot;Reply&quot;. Wakefield made a systemic and personalised attack on the lack of justice in the court and process. He had checked the pamphlet for libellous content with a barrister. The judge summed up in support of Scott, and the jury returned a guilty verdict without retiring.

Wakefield was imprisoned in Dorchester gaol for two years for seditious libel. Among his visitors there was Robert Southey in 1801. He was released from prison on 29 May 1801, and died in Hackney on 9 September 1801, a victim of typhus fever. His library was put up for auction by Leigh, Sotherby &amp; Co. in March 1802.

==Scholarship==
&quot;A new translation of those parts only of the New Testament, which are wrongly translated in our common version&quot; (1789) was followed in 1791 by Wakefield&#x27;s &quot;Translation of the New Testament, with Notes,&quot; in three volumes. In his memoirs Wakefield records that the work was laborious, particularly in the comparison of the Oriental versions with the Received Text; but was &quot;much more profitable to me than all my other publications put together&quot;. A revised edition followed in 1795.

Wakefield also published editions of various classical writers, and among his theological writings are &quot;Early Christian Writers on the Person of Christ&quot; (1784), &quot;Silva Critica&quot; (1789–95), and illustrations of the Scriptures.

==Family==
Wakefield married in 1779 Anne Watson (died 1819), niece of the incumbent John Watson at Stockport St Mary where he had been a curate. They had five sons and two daughters.

*George (born c.1780), the eldest son, married in 1816 Anne Bowness, daughter of the Rev. William Bowness. He worked as an ordnance storekeeper in Kingston, Upper Canada, and died in 1837 at Barnstaple, aged 57.
*Gilbert (baptised 1790 in Nottingham)
*Henry (1793–1861), third son, married in 1817 Harriet Pomeroy, daughter of Thomas Pomeroy. He was a surgeon, beginning as a pupil in Knutsford of Peter Holland, father of Sir Henry Holland. He was on the continent after Waterloo, where his brother George was serving. He was surgeon to the county prisons from 1830.
*Robert, youngest surviving son, died in 1866 at age 70.
*Alfred, who died while his father was in prison.
*Anne (died 1821) married Charles Rochemont Aikin, and was mother of Anna Letitia Le Breton.
*Elizabeth (died 1811), younger daughter, married in 1809 Francis Wakefield the younger.

Their daughter Anne, in poor health, went to stay with Peter Crompton and his wife at Eton House, on the edge of Liverpool, shortly before Gilbert was imprisoned. George, the eldest son, went to Dorchester Grammar school, under Henry John Richman who was on good terms with Wakefield. At this time William Shepherd took care of his younger brother Gilbert. One of the daughters, to whom Wakefield&#x27;s gaoler&#x27;s son had been paying unwelcome attentions, went to stay with William Roscoe.

<text>John Francis Waller (21 July 1809 – 19 January 1894) was an Irish poet, librettist and editor.

==Life==
The son of Thomas Maunsell Waller, of an Irish baronetical family, and Margaret Vereker, Waller was born in Finnoe, County Tipperary, studied at Trinity College, Dublin (BA, 1831) and was called to the Irish Bar in 1833. Under the pseudonym of &quot;Jonathan Freke Slingsby&quot; he wrote for the Dublin University Magazine and became its editor in 1845. He held the position of vice-president of the Royal Irish Academy from 1864 and was appointed Registrar of the Rolls Court in 1867. His older brother was Edward Waller (zoologist) 1804-1873.

==Works==
Besides editing the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, he also edited the &quot;Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography&quot; and contributed articles to &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary&quot;.

Waller published several volumes of poems and also wrote the words to many popular songs, including &quot;Cushla Ma Chree&quot;, &quot;The Spinning Wheel&quot; and &quot;Song of the Glass&quot;. Many of his odes and poems were set to music by Irish composers, including Joseph Robinson, James Cooksey Culwick, Robert Prescott Stewart, Michael William Balfe, and George Alexander Osborne, Stewart being particularly fond of his works. He also wrote words for compositions by George Alexander Macfarren, Charles Oberthür, and Franz Wilhelm Abt. He was responsible for the explanatory notes and a life of the author in a new edition of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; written by Dean Jonathan Swift.

<doc id="1318140" wikidata="Q4736543" url="?curid=1318140" title="Alternative newspaper">
<text>An alternative newspaper is a type of newspaper that eschews comprehensive coverage of general news in favor of stylized reporting, opinionated reviews and columns, investigations into edgy topics and magazine-style feature stories highlighting local people and culture. Its news coverage is more locally focused, and their target audiences are younger than those of daily newspapers. Typically, alternative newspapers are published in tabloid format and printed on newsprint. Other names for such publications include alternative weekly, alternative newsweekly, and alt weekly, as the majority circulate on a weekly schedule.

Most metropolitan areas of the United States and Canada are home to at least one alternative paper. These papers are generally found in such urban areas, although a few publish in smaller cities, in rural areas or exurban areas where they may be referred to as an alt monthly due to the less frequent publication schedule.

==Content==

Alternative papers have usually operated under a different business model than daily papers. Most alternative papers, such as &quot;The Stranger&quot;, the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, the &quot;New York Press&quot;, the &quot;Metro Times&quot;, the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Boise Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Long Island Press&quot;, have been free, earning revenue through the sale of advertising space. They sometimes include ads for adult entertainment, such as adult bookstores and strip clubs, which are prohibited in many mainstream daily newspapers. They usually include comprehensive classified and personal ad sections and event listings as well.

Many alternative papers feature an annual &quot;best of&quot; issue, profiling businesses that readers voted the best of their type in the area. Often these papers send out certificates that the businesses hang on their wall or window. This further cements the paper&#x27;s ties to local businesses.

Alternative newspapers represent the more commercialized and mainstream evolution of the underground press associated with the 1960s counterculture. Their focus remains on arts and entertainment and social and political reportage. Editorial positions at alternative weeklies are predominantly left-leaning, though there is a contingent of conservative and libertarian alt-weeklies. Styles vary sharply among alternative newspapers; some affect a satirical, ironic tone, while others embrace a more straightforward approach to reporting.

Columns commonly syndicated to alternative weeklies include &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, Dan Savage&#x27;s &quot;Savage Love&quot;, Rob Breszny&#x27;s &quot;Free Will Astrology&quot;, and Ben Tausig&#x27;s crossword puzzle &quot;Ink Well.&quot; Quirky, non-mainstream comics, such as Matt Groening&#x27;s &quot;Life in Hell&quot;, Lynda Barry&#x27;s &quot;Ernie Pook&#x27;s Comeek&quot;, Ruben Bolling&#x27;s &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot;, and Ted Rall&#x27;s political cartoons are also common.

The &quot;Village Voice&quot;, based in New York City, was one of the first and best-known examples of the form. Since the Voice&#x27;s demise in 2018, Marin County&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Sun&quot;, founded in 1963, is now the longest-running alternative weekly.

The Association of Alternative Newsmedia is the alternative weeklies&#x27; trade association. The Alternative Weekly Network and the Ruxton Group are national advertising sales representatives for alternative weeklies.

==Chains and mergers==

Some alternative newspapers are independent. However, due in part to increasing concentration of media ownership, many have been bought or launched by larger media conglomerates. The Tribune Company, a multibillion-dollar company that owns the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, owns four New England alternative weeklies, including the &quot;Hartford Advocate&quot; and &quot;New Haven Advocate.&quot;

&quot;Creative Loafing&quot;, originally only an Atlanta-based alternative weekly, grew into Creative Loafing, Inc. which owned papers in three other southern U.S. cities, as well as the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; and &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;.

Village Voice Media and New Times Media merged in 2006; before that, they were the two largest chains.

The pre-merger Village Voice Media, an outgrowth of New York City&#x27;s &quot;Village Voice&quot;, included &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, &quot;OC Weekly&quot;, &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;, &quot;Minneapolis City Pages&quot;, and &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;.

New Times Media included at the time of the merger &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot;, &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;, &quot;Westword&quot;, &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, &quot;New Times Broward-Palm Beach&quot;, &quot;Houston Press&quot;, &quot;The Pitch&quot;, &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, &quot;SF Weekly&quot; and &quot;Riverfront Times&quot;.

In 2003, the two companies entered into a non-competition agreement which stated that the two would not publish in the same market. Because of this, New Times Media eliminated &quot;New Times LA&quot;, a competitor to Village Voice Media&#x27;s &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, and Village Voice Media ceased publishing &quot;Cleveland Free Times&quot;, a competitor to New Times Media&#x27;s &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot;. The US Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the agreement. The case was settled out of court with the two companies agreeing to make available the publishing assets and titles of their defunct papers to potential competitors. The &quot;Cleveland Free Times&quot; recommenced publication in 2003 under the publication group Kildysart LLC, while the assets of &quot;New Times LA&quot; were sold to Southland Publishing and relaunched as &quot;LA CityBeat&quot;.

On October 24, 2005, New Times Media announced a deal to acquire Village Voice Media, creating a chain of 17 free weekly newspapers around the country with a combined circulation of 1.8 million and controlling a quarter of the weekly circulation of alternative weekly newspapers in North America. The deal was approved by the Justice Department and, on January 31, 2006, the companies merged into one, taking the name Village Voice Media.

Phoenix Media/Communications Group, owner of the popular Boston alternative weekly the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;, expanded to Providence, Rhode Island in 1988 with their purchase of &quot;NewPaper&quot;, which was renamed the &quot;Providence Phoenix&quot;. In 1999, PM/CG expanded further through New England to Portland, Maine with the creation of the &quot;Portland Phoenix&quot;. From 1992 through 2005, PM/GC owned and operated the &quot;Worcester Phoenix&quot; in Worcester, Massachusetts, but PM/GC folded that branch because of Worcester&#x27;s dwindling art scene.

Nonetheless, a number of owner-operated, non-chain owned alternative papers survive, among them &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot; in San Jose, &quot;Pittsburgh City Paper&quot; in Pittsburgh, &quot;Salt Lake City Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Pacific Sun&quot;, the Bohemian in California&#x27;s Sonoma and Napa counties, the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;, &quot;Isthmus&quot; in Madison, Wisconsin, &quot;Flagpole Magazine&quot; in Athens, Georgia, the &quot;Boulder Weekly&quot;, &quot;Willamette Week&quot; in Portland, Oregon, &quot;Independent Weekly&quot;, &quot;Yes! Weekly&quot;, &quot;Creative Loafing&quot;, and &quot;Triad City Beat&quot; in North Carolina, the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; in Texas, &quot;The Stranger&quot; in Seattle, Washington, &quot;Artvoice&quot; in Buffalo, New York, the &quot;Aquarian Weekly&quot; in North Jersey, the &quot;Colorado Springs Independent&quot;, the &quot;Good Times&quot; in Santa Cruz, California, &quot;New Times&quot; in San Luis Obispo and the &quot;Sun&quot; in Northern Santa Barbara County, California.

Canadian examples of owner-operated, non-chain owned alternative papers include Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;, Toronto&#x27;s &quot;NOW Magazine&quot;, Edmonton&#x27;s &quot;Vue Weekly&quot; and Halifax&#x27;s &quot;The Coast&quot;. Examples outside the United States and Canada include Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;BCN Mes&quot;.

<doc id="1318142" wikidata="Q7348936" url="?curid=1318142" title="Robert Plumer Ward">
<text>Robert Ward, or from 1828 Robert Plumer Ward (19 March 1765 – 13 August 1846), was an English barrister, politician, and novelist. George Canning said that his law books were as pleasant as novels, and his novels as dull as law books.

==Life==
He was born in Mount Street, Mayfair, London, on 19 March 1765, the son of John Ward by his wife Rebecca Raphael. His father was a merchant in Gibraltar and, also for many years, was chief clerk to the civil department of the ordnance in the garrison there. His mother belonged to a Sephardic Jewish family from Genoa. Robert Ward was educated first at Robert Macfarlane&#x27;s private school at Walthamstow, and then at Westminster School. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 12 February 1783. In 1785 he became a student of the Inner Temple.

Ward then passed some years abroad, and travelled in France during the early part of the revolutionary period. He was called to the bar on 17 June 1790, and soon after went the western circuit. In London in 1794, a chance conversation in Bell Yard near Fleet Street put him in possession of information about subversion, and Ward took it to Richard Ford, who was a police magistrate. Ford took Ward directly to William Pitt the Prime Minister, and the law officers Archibald Macdonald and John Scott. This fortuitous discovery gave Ward his political and legal contacts.

Ward now switched from the western to the northern circuit, to take advantage of his new connections. He had also a small common-law practice in London and before the privy council. He wrote another legal work to order, for the government. A reward in the shape of a judgeship in Nova Scotia was offered Ward; then in June 1802, he received from Pitt an offer of a safe seat in the House of Commons. Ward was Member of Parliament (MP) for Cockermouth from 1802 to 1806, after Pitt had recommended him to Lord Lowther for the seat. He was returned on 8 July 1802, but did not speak in the house till 13 December, when, somewhat to the annoyance of his friends, he supported Henry Addington.

Pitt returned to power in summer 1804. Lord Mulgrave succeeded Lord Harrowby at the Foreign Office at the beginning of 1805, and gave Ward (a family connection through their wives) the post of under-secretary, Ward resigning a sinecure post he held as Welsh judge. Charles James Fox took over from Mulgrave in 1806, and Ward lost the post, taken up by George Hammond. On the formation of the Duke of Portland&#x27;s ministry of 1807, with the appointment of Mulgrave as First Lord of the Admiralty, Ward was given a seat on the Admiralty board.

Ward was MP for Haslemere from 1807 to 1823. Turning down an offer of a Treasury lordship, Ward remained at the Admiralty till June 1811, when he was appointed Clerk of the Ordnance. He served in this office under Mulgrave, who was head of the department, till 1823. He made a lengthy report on the state of the ordnance department in Ireland, which was published on 9 November 1816. The following year he made a survey of the eastern and southern coast of England for the same purpose, and in 1819 for the north of England. Retiring from the Commons after the session of 1823, he was appointed auditor of the Civil List.

Ward owned Hyde House near Hyde Heath in Buckinghamshire, in the early 19th century. In 1811, he anticipated the dismissal of the government in the wake of the passing of the Regency Act, and looked forward to &quot;...being at Hyde House in a fortnight. My garden, farm, plantations and library are the prevailing ideas, and every purchase I have lately made, whether books or pruning-knives are all with a view to my long wished retreat.&quot; Ward retired as a widower to Hyde House in 1823 to write his novel &quot;Trentaine, or The Man of Refinement&quot;.

He was married for a second time in 1828 to Jane Plumer, the widow and heiress of William Plumer (1736–1822), adopted the additional name of Plumer and took up residence at Gilston Park, Hertfordshire, which his wife had inherited from her late husband. In 1832 he was appointed High Sheriff. His office as auditor of the Civil List was incorporated into the treasury in January 1831, and, again a widower, he spent time abroad.

He was married for a third time in 1833 to Mary, the daughter of General Sir George Anson. In 1845, the couple were living at 2 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair. Early in 1846 he moved with his wife to the official residence of her father, who was the governor of Chelsea Hospital, and died there on 13 August the same year. There is a portrait of Ward by Henry Perronet Briggs, an engraving of which by Charles Turner is prefixed to his &quot;Memoirs&quot;.

==Works==
He wrote non-fiction and fiction, with some books on international law.

* This has been regarded as the first attempt to write a history of international law. It was at the suggestion of William Scott.
* &quot;A Treatise of the relative Rights and Duties of Belligerents and Neutral Powers in Maritime Affairs, in which the Principles of the armed Neutralities and the Opinions of Hübner and Schlegel are fully discussed&quot; (1801). This work related to the Second League of Armed Neutrality 1800–1 and was undertaken at Lord Grenville&#x27;s request, as Foreign Secretary, to represent the rights of belligerents from the British point of view. It was not published in complete form, and in an introduction to an 1875 reprint, Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley commented on the extremely low subsequent profile of the work.
* &quot;An Essay on Contraband; being a Continuation of the Treatise of the relative Rights and Duties&quot; (1801).
* &quot;A View of the relative Situations of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Addington previous to and on the night of Mr. Patten&#x27;s Motion&quot; (1804) was Ward&#x27;s (anonymous) involvement in early 1804 in a pamphlet war, on Pitt&#x27;s side against supporters of the Addington Ministry. It had been set off by &quot;A Few Cursory Remarks upon the State of Parties&quot; (1803, anonymous, by Thomas Richard Bentley). Henry Addington was probably not involved, but Hiley Addington and Charles Bragge quite likely were; on Pitt&#x27;s side Thomas Courtenay was used to reply, but Ward involved himself on his own initiative. There was a reply from John Adolphus.
* &quot;An Enquiry into the Manner in which the different Wars of Europe have commenced during the last two Centuries&quot; (1804 or 1805). This work defended the seizure of a Spanish treasure-ship (6 October 1804); and was read and approved by Pitt before publication.
* &quot;Tremaine; or, the Man of Refinement&quot; (1825), novel.
* &quot;De Vere; or, the Man of Independence&quot; (1827), novel. In it George Canning is supposedly depicted under the character of Wentworth.
* &quot;Illustrations of Human Life&quot;, 1837; 2nd edit. 1843. &quot;Saint Lawrence&quot; in this work is based on a true story, from Joseph Hunter, &quot;A True Account of the Alienation and Recovery of the Estates of the Offleys of Norton&quot; (1754).
* &quot;An Historical Essay on the real Character and Amount of the Precedent of the Revolution of 1688&quot;, 1838, 2 vols. When this work was badly reviewed in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and styled a Tory pamphlet in the guise of history, Ward answered the reviewer in an anonymous pamphlet entitled &quot;The Reviewer Reviewed&quot;
* &quot;Pictures of the World at Home and Abroad&quot;, 1839, 3 vols.
* &quot;An Historical Essay on the Real Character and Amount of the Precedent of the Revolution of 1688&quot; (1838)
* &quot;De Clifford; or, the Constant Man&quot; (1841), novel.

&quot;Memoirs of the Political and Literary Life of Robert Plumer Ward&quot; appeared in 1850, edited by Edmund Phipps. Selections from Ward&#x27;s unpublished works are contained in vol. ii. of the &quot;Memoir&quot;; they are short essays on different subjects under the title of &quot;The Day Dreamer&quot;. The published portion of Ward&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; extends from 1809 (when he began it) to 22 November 1820; the remaining portion was not published because the editor regarded it (in 1850) as too recent. Its historical value is that Ward was on intimate terms with Spencer Perceval.

Many of his letters to Peter George Patmore, who advised in literary matters, are in Patmore&#x27;s &quot;Friends and Acquaintances&quot;. Ward edited &quot;Chatsworth, or the Romance of a Week&quot;, a number of tales by Patmore.

==Family==
Ward married three times.

#His first marriage, on 2 April 1796, was to Catherine Julia, the fourth daughter of Christopher Thompson Maling of Durham. By it, Ward became acquainted with Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, who had married the eldest daughter. Henry George Ward, their son, was a diplomat, politician, and travel author.
#On 16 July 1828 Ward married, secondly, Mrs. Plumer Lewin of Gilston Park, Hertfordshire, and on this occasion took the surname of Plumer in addition to Ward. She died in 1831. Her first husband had been the MP William Plumer, who died in 1822. She then married Captain Richard John Lewin R.N., brother of Harriet Grote, in 1825; he died in 1827. On her death in 1833, the fortune she had from William Plumer passed to Henry George Ward, her stepson.
#He married, thirdly, in 1833, Mary Anne, the rich widow of Charles Gregory Okeover. She was the daughter of General Sir George Anson and the sister of Admiral Talavera Anson.

Ward was the grandfather of the judge Dudley Ward; the uncle by marriage of his biographer Edmund Phipps, and the great-uncle of the theologian William George Ward.

<text>Susan Bogert Warner (pen name, Elizabeth Wetherell; July 11, 1819 – March 17, 1885) was an American Presbyterian writer of religious fiction, children&#x27;s fiction, and theological works. She is best remembered for her massive bestseller &quot;The Wide, Wide World&quot;. Her other works include &quot;Queechy&quot;, &quot;The Hills of the Shatemuc&quot;, &quot;Melbourne House&quot;, &quot;Daisy&quot;, &quot;Walks from Eden&quot;, &quot;House of Israel&quot;, &quot;What She Could&quot;, &quot;Opportunities&quot;, and &quot;House in Town&quot;. Warner and her sister, Anna, wrote a series of semi-religious novels that had extraordinary sales, including &quot;Say and Seal&quot;, &quot;Christmas Stocking&quot;, &quot;Books of Blessing&quot; (in 8 volumes), and &quot;The Law and the Testimony&quot;.

==Early years and education==
Susan Warner was born in New York City, July 11, 1819. Warner could trace her lineage back to the Puritans on both sides. Her father was Henry Warner, a New York City lawyer originally from New England, and her mother was Anna Bartlett, from a wealthy, fashionable family in New York&#x27;s Hudson Square. When Warner was a young child, her mother died, and her father&#x27;s sister, Fanny, came to live with the Warners. Though the father had been wealthy, he lost most of his fortune in the Panic of 1837 and in subsequent lawsuits and poor investments. The family had to leave their mansion at St. Mark&#x27;s Place in New York and move to an old Revolutionary War-era farmhouse on Constitution Island, near West Point, New York. In 1849, seeing little change in their family&#x27;s financial situation, Susan and Anna started writing to earn income.

==Career==
She wrote, under the name of &quot;Elizabeth Wetherell&quot;, thirty novels, many of which went into multiple editions. However, her first novel, &quot;The Wide, Wide World&quot; (1850), was the most popular. It was translated into several other languages, including French, German, and Dutch. Other than &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, it was perhaps the most widely circulated story of American authorship. Other works include &quot;Queechy&quot; (1852), &quot;The Law and the Testimony&quot;, (1853), &quot;The Hills of the Shatemuc&quot;, (1856), &quot;The Old Helmet&quot; (1863), and &quot;Melbourne House&quot; (1864). In the nineteenth century, critics admired the depictions of rural American life in her early novels. American reviewers also praised Warner&#x27;s Christian and moral teachings, while London reviewers tended not to favor her didacticism. Early twentieth-century critics classified Warner&#x27;s work as &quot;sentimental&quot; and thus lacking in literary value. In the later twentieth century, feminist critics rediscovered &quot;The Wide, Wide World&quot;, discussing it as a quintessential domestic novel and focusing on analyzing its portrayal of gender dynamics.

Some of her works were written jointly with her younger sister Anna Bartlett Warner, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Amy Lothrop&quot;. The Warner sisters also wrote children&#x27;s Christian songs. Susan wrote &quot;Jesus Bids Us Shine&quot; while Anna was author of the first verse of the well-known children&#x27;s song &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot;, which she wrote at Susan&#x27;s request.

Both sisters became devout Christians in the late 1830s. After their conversion, they became confirmed members of the Mercer Street Presbyterian church, although in later life, Warner became drawn into Methodist circles. The sisters also held Bible studies for the West Point cadets. When they were on military duty, the cadets would sing &quot;Jesus Loves Me.&quot; The popularity of the song was so great that upon Warner&#x27;s death, she was buried in the West Point Cemetery.

Susan Warner died in Highland Falls, New York and is buried in the West Point Cemetery.

<doc id="1318158" wikidata="Q7412884" url="?curid=1318158" title="Samuel Warren (British lawyer)">
<text>Samuel Warren (23 May 1807 – 29 July 1877) was a British barrister, novelist and MP.

==Life==
He was born in Wales at Rackery Farm near Wrexham, Denbighshire, the son of Anne (née Williams), who died in 1823, and Samuel Warren (1781–1862), a Wesleyan Methodist minister, who formed a breakaway group, and in later life was an Anglican priest in Ancoats. The memoirs of Samuel Dousland Waddy, an apprentice in 1820 to a London linen draper, state that Warren was also an apprentice there. It is thought by Dunlop that as a teenager Warren worked in a medical capacity, perhaps as an apprentice to an apothecary.

Warren attended the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, in the years 1826 to 1828, where he won prizes and attention, but did not take a degree. He then entered the Inner Temple, studying law and acting as a special pleader, and was called to the bar in 1837. In 1852 he was made Recorder of Hull.

Entering politics, Warren sat in the House of Commons for Midhurst 1856–1859, and was a Master in Lunacy 1859–77. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1835. He died in London.

==Works==
&quot;Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician&quot;, by Warren but initially published anonymously, was a series of sensational tales, fictional case histories, published first in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from August 1830 to 1837. It was hugely successful. The frame story to the series is of &quot;early struggles&quot; of a young medical man, and has been taken to contain embellished autobiographical material. In the preface to fifth edition (1855) was Warren&#x27;s statement that &quot;I was six years actively engaged in the practical study of physic&quot;.

The structure and use of professional anecdotes as a vehicle are now considered foundational for later mainstream crime fiction. The tales contributed also to a sub-genre of the short story, known as &quot;&quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; fiction&quot;, which often used the supernatural, or apparent supernatural, and owed something to John Ferriar and Samuel Hibbert-Ware. Proposed bookends are an 1821 story by William Maginn, and one by Samuel Ferguson in 1837, when Warren&#x27;s series had concluded.

Warren was also the author of two novels:

# &quot;Ten Thousand a-Year&quot; (1839), with social satire written from a Tory standpoint. First published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It was based on the contemporary peerage claim of Alexander Humphrys-Alexander, a forgery case.
# &quot;Now and Then&quot; (1847), a social novel of criminality and the law, arguing from a Methodist perspective the moral case for reform. It was based in outline on an actual case in Wolverhampton, and had little success.

The influence of Warren on Charles Dickens has been traced, for example in &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

Warren was also a legal writer. His &quot;Select Extracts from Blackstone&#x27;s Commentaries&quot; (first edition 1836) was with John William Smith, whose name did not appear.

==Family==
Warren married in 1831 Elizabeth (Eliza) Ballenger (died 1868), daughter of James Ballenger of Woodford Bridge House, Essex, who had married in 1824 W. Vanhouse; they had two sons and a daughter. Eliza&#x27;s father, who died in 1830, was a sugar refiner in Davenant Street, Whitechapel.

The elder son, Samuel Lilckendey Warren (born 1835), graduated B.A. in 1859 and became an Anglian priest. The younger son, Edward Walpole Warren (1838–1903), was another cleric, a Cambridge graduate. He was rector of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, Manhattan, from 1887 to 1895.

Warren married, secondly, Louisa Beaumont in 1871.

<doc id="1318163" wikidata="Q2747828" url="?curid=1318163" title="Apaches (subculture)">
<text>Les Apaches () was a Parisian Belle Époque violent criminal underworld subculture of early 20th-century hooligans, night muggers, street gangs and other criminals. After news of their notoriety spread over Europe, the term was used to describe violent street crime in other countries as well; for example, &quot;Russian apaches&quot;.

==Name==
There are a number of stories about the origin of the term &quot;Apaches&quot;, the common thread being that this was a comparison of their savagery with that attributed by Europeans to the Native American tribes of Apaches. 

A 1904 issue of the French Q&amp;A magazine &quot;L&#x27;Intermédiaire des chercheurs et curieux&quot; credited a journalist named Victor Moris with the popularization of the term. In November 1900 a police inspector of the Belleville district of police was describing to him a particularly bloody scene and concluded with the words: &quot;C&#x27;est un véritable truc d&#x27;Apaches!&quot;.

A story in a 1910 Sunday supplement of &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; claimed that when a certain gang leader nicknamed &quot;Terreur&quot; (Terror) heard that the actions of the band were compared with these of the Apaches, he was so pleased that he proceeded to call his gang &quot;Apaches of Belleville&quot;.

==Description==
During their heyday, the prospect of being mugged or otherwise assaulted by Apache gangsters was especially feared by members of the emergent bourgeois. 

Some of the gangs used a unique type of pistol which was named the &quot;Apache revolver&quot; or &quot;Apache pistol&quot;: a pinfire cartridge pepperbox revolver with no barrel, a set of foldover brass knuckles for a handgrip, and a folding knife mounted right underneath the revolver drum for use as a stabbing weapon.

The Apaches also developed a semi-codified collection of &quot;tricks&quot; used in mugging and hand-to-hand combat. The most famous was the &quot;coup du Père François&quot;, a tactic by which a victim was stalked by several Apaches. One garroted the victim from behind while taking him piggyback to prevent struggling; another Apache was assigned the job of searching through the victim&#x27;s pockets for any valuables, while another served as a lookout. Although the intent was to only incapacitate, death from prolonged strangulation could still occur.

==Disappearance==

The existence of Apaches as a semi-organised gang-culture in Paris during the early 1900s was exaggerated in media coverage, although it did reflect the reality of a higher proportion of young males among the city population than elsewhere in France. With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 the wholesale mobilisation of this class for military service led to a reduction of violent street crime and the subsequent fading of Apache mythology. After 1919 the incidence of urban violence returned to pre-war levels but without such symbols supposedly favoured by Apaches, such as the wearing of coloured sashes or the carrying of specially designed weapons.

==Cultural influence==

Certain elements of the Apache &quot;style&quot; became influential in French and then international popular culture, including the Apache dance and Apache shirt. Classes were offered in &quot;la langue verte&quot;, the colourful argot spoken by Apache gangsters. 

The play &quot;Gigolette&quot; (slang for young prostitute) was based on the story of a love triangle between prostitute Amelie-Elie and members of the Apache gang. At least two film versions followed decades later. &quot;Casque d&#x27;Or&quot;, the 1952 film by Jacques Becker, tells the story of a young demi-mondaine mixed up with a Belleville street gang.

The famous French 10-part seven-hour silent film &quot;Les Vampires&quot; (1915, re-released on DVD in 2005) is about an Apache gang named &quot;the Vampires&quot;. Emilio Ghione&#x27;s &quot;La Mort&quot; series of films—of which only &quot;I topi grigi&quot; (&quot;The grey rats&quot;, 1918), &quot;Anime buie&quot; (&quot;Dark souls&quot;, 1916) and a fragment of &quot;Dollari e Fracks&quot; (&quot;Dollars and dinner jackets&quot;, 1919) still exist—was about the adventures of a &#x27;noble&#x27; Apache in the Parisian underworld and further afield.

The German silent film The Apache of Marseilles (1919), directed by Ewald André Dupont, is a thriller that aims to show the violent criminal subculture of the Apaches.

The popular Italian pulp fiction writer Aristide Marino Gianella also wrote a serial novel called &quot;Gli apache parigini&quot;, which was first available in short installments and then within a complete volume.

In his book &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, the French novelist and essayist Marcel Proust uses the bellicose practices of the Apache gang as an illustration of the sort of duplicitous survival instincts of nation states which wage wars, or make threats of war, out of fear of losing their sovereignty.

In the 1932 film &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;, Maurice Chevalier sings the song &quot;I&#x27;m an Apache&quot;, about the life of an Apache gangster.

In the 2023 film &quot;&quot;, the titular characters are Apaches members.

<text>Daniel Waterland (14 Feb 1683 – 23 December 1740) was an English theologian. He became Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1714, Chancellor of the Diocese of York in 1722, and Archdeacon of Middlesex in 1730.

Waterland opposed the latitudinarians of his time. He was an acute controversialist on behalf of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, on which he wrote several treatises. He was also the author of a &quot;History of the Athanasian Creed&quot; (1724).

==Early life==
The second son of Henry Waterland, rector of Walesby and Flixborough, Lincolnshire, by his second wife, he was born at Walesby on 14 Feb 1683. He was educated at the Lincoln Grammar School. At Magdalene College, Cambridge, he was admitted on 30 March 1699 and elected scholar on 26 December 1702; and became a fellow on 13 February 1703–4. He graduated B.A. in 1703 and B.D. in 1714, and proceeded M.A. in 1706 and D.D. in 1717. On 8 May 1724 he was incorporated at Oxford.

==Cambridge academic==
Waterland was conscientious, and devoted to tutorial work and university business. He was examiner in arts in 1710 and in the philosophical schools in 1711. In February 1713 he was appointed by the visitor, Lord Suffolk and Bindon, to the mastership of his college, vacant by the death of Gabriel Quadring, and presented to the rectory of Ellingham, Norfolk. At the public commencement in 1714 he held a disputation with Thomas Sherlock on the question of Arian subscription. On 14 November 1715 he succeeded Sherlock as vice-chancellor of the university. In 1716 he preached the sermon on occasion of the university&#x27;s public thanksgiving (7 June) for the suppression of the Jacobite Rising of 1715, and on 22 October presented to the Prince of Wales at Hampton Court an address of congratulation.

In 1717 Waterland was appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king. His controversial works marked him out as a successor to George Bull, and he became the first lecturer on Lady Moyer&#x27;s endowment. He joined in the censure passed by the Cambridge heads of houses in January 1721 on Richard Bentley&#x27;s libel on John Colbatch.

==Preferment==
In 1721 Waterland was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral to the London rectory of St. Austin and St. Faith. On 21 December 1722 he was appointed by Archbishop William Dawes as chancellor of the diocese of York. He took an active part in the final stage of the struggle with Bentley, being a member of the syndicate appointed on 26 September 1723 to take steps to defeat or delay his restoration to office.

A Windsor canonry was added to Waterland&#x27;s preferments on 27 September 1727, and in 1730 the archdeaconry of Middlesex (13 August) and the vicarage of Twickenham (October); and he resigned his London rectory.

==Later life and death==
Waterland declined in 1734 the office of prolocutor to the lower house of Convocation, and also at a later date (December 1738 or May 1740) the see of Llandaff. He died without issue on 23 December 1740. His remains were interred in the south transept of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. In 1719 he had married Theodosia (d. 8 December 1761), daughter of John Tregonwell of Anderton, Dorset.

==Works==
The unauthorised publication of a correspondence which had passed between him and John Jackson on the Arian tendency of Samuel Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity&quot; drew from Waterland &quot;A Vindication of Christ&#x27;s Divinity&quot;, Cambridge, 1719, in which he attacked not only Clarke, but Daniel Whitby. Whitby replied, and Waterland published an &quot;Answer&quot; to his reply, Cambridge, 1720. The &quot;Eight Sermons in Defence of the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, his Moyer Lectures in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, published at Cambridge in 1720, were reprinted at Oxford in 1815.

In 1723 appeared his &quot;Critical History of the Athanasian Creed&quot; (Cambridge), in which, with a thorough review of the then accessible evidence, he assigned the creed to the decade 430–40, and its composition to Hilary of Arles. A second edition was issued in 1728. Reprints appeared at London in 1850, and at Oxford, edited by John Richard King, in 1870; Waterland&#x27;s argument was discussed by Joseph Rawson Lumby, &quot;History of the Creeds&quot;, 3rd ed. 1887.

He engaged in the deistical controversy with &quot;Scripture Vindicated&quot; (Cambridge, 1730–2, 3 pts.), a reply to Matthew Tindal&#x27;s &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;. To Edmund Law&#x27;s &quot;Enquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time, Immensity, and Eternity&quot; (1734), Waterland contributed an appendix &quot;A Dissertation upon the Argument a priori for proving the Existence of a First Cause&quot;, in which, with reference to Clarke, he tried to dispose of the ontological argument in the supposed interests of orthodoxy. &quot;The Importance of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity Asserted&quot;, London, 1734,; 3rd ed. Cambridge, 1800; and &quot;Review of the Doctrine of the Eucharist as laid down in Scripture and Antiquity&quot;, Cambridge, 1737, were other major works. A reprint of the latter appeared at Oxford in 1868; new ed. 1896. Waterland&#x27;s &quot;Discourse of Fundamentals&quot; (1735) is often regarded as an important contribution to Protestant thought on the doctrine of fundamental articles.

Waterland&#x27;s other works, besides sermons and charges, included:

* &quot;The Case of Arian Subscription Considered&quot;, Cambridge, 1721;
* &quot;A Supplement to the Case of Arian Subscription Considered&quot;, London, 1722; reply to Arthur Ashley Sykes. 
* &quot;The Scriptures and the Arians compared in their accounts of God the Father and God the Son&quot;, London, 1722. 
* &quot;A Second Vindication of Christ&#x27;s Divinity&quot;, London, 1723.
* &quot;A Further Vindication of Christ&#x27;s Divinity&quot;, London, 1724.
* &quot;Remarks upon Dr. Clarke&#x27;s Exposition of the Church Catechism&quot;, London, 1730; to Sykes and Thomas Emlyn. 
* &quot;The Nature, Obligation, and Efficacy of the Christian Sacraments Considered&quot;, London, 1730; and its &#x27;Supplement&#x27; published the same year. 
* &quot;Advice to a Young Student&quot;, London, 1730; 3rd ed. Cambridge, 1760; London, 1761. 
* &quot;Regeneration Stated and Explained&quot;, London, 1740, 1780.
* &quot;A Summary View of the Doctrine of Justification&quot;. 
* &quot;An Inquiry concerning the Antiquity of the Practice of Infant Communion&quot;.

These two last tracts first appeared posthumously with Waterland&#x27;s &quot;Sermons&quot;, ed. Joseph Clarke, London, 1742, 2 vols.; 2nd ed. 1776.

A collected edition of Waterland&#x27;s works, with a review of his life and writings by William Van Mildert, appeared at Oxford in 1823, 10 vols. The last volume is mainly letters; there are also &quot;Fourteen Letters&quot; to Zachary Pearce, ed. Edward Churton, Oxford, 1868, and &quot;Five Letters&quot; to William Staunton, appended to the latter&#x27;s &quot;Reason and Revelation Stated&quot;, London, 1722. Four letters to John Anstis the elder are in Stowe MS. 749, ff. 273–49.

==Modern Treatment==

The Rt. Rev. Ray R. Sutton of Dallas, Texas completed a doctoral thesis under Dr. Alister McGrath entitled &quot;The Sacramental Theology of Daniel Waterland&quot;, completed in 1998 and awarded by Coventry University. Waterland is covered extensively in the book &quot;Reformation Without End: Religion, Politics and the Past in Post-revolutionary England&quot;&#x27; by Robert G. Ingram (Manchester University Press, 2018). For his thought on &quot;fundamental articles&quot;, see chapter six of Stephen Pickard&#x27;s doctoral thesis at Durham, and the first major study in the Cambridge University doctoral thesis of Simeon Williams.

<text>The Tarrantines were a band of the Mi&#x27;kmaq tribe of Native Americans inhabiting northern New England, particularly coastal Maine. The name &quot;Tarrantine&quot; is one of the words the Massachusett people used to refer to the &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaq&quot; people.

In the first three decades of the 17th century, the Tarrantines had a warlike reputation with their southwestern neighbors. The Tarrantines were spared the epidemic of 1617 that devastated the Native American populations to their south, leaving the neighboring tribes greatly outnumbered. Due to their proximity to fur traders of Maine and Quebec, the Tarrantines had access to firearms, giving them a technological advantage as well.

<doc id="1318175" wikidata="Q249240" url="?curid=1318175" title="Signalling theory">
<text>Within evolutionary biology, signalling theory is a body of theoretical work examining communication between individuals, both within species and across species. The central question is how organisms with conflicting interests, such as in sexual selection, are expected to provide honest signals rather than deceive or cheat, given that the passing on of pleiotropic traits is subject to natural selection, which aims to minimize associated costs without assuming any conscious intent. Mathematical models describe how signalling can contribute to an evolutionarily stable strategy.

Signals are given in contexts such as mate selection by females, which subjects the advertising males&#x27; signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the receiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly benefit that signaller, at the risk of undermining the signalling system for the whole population.

The question of whether the selection of signals works at the level of the individual organism or gene, or at the level of the group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi&#x27;s theory, signallers such as male peacocks have &quot;tails&quot; that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.

The same mechanisms can be expected in humans, where researchers have studied behaviours including risk-taking by young men, hunting of large game animals, and costly religious rituals, finding that these appear to qualify as costly honest signals.

==Sexual selection==
When animals choose mating partners, traits such as signalling are subject to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, &quot;Hyla versicolor&quot;, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, in a similar way to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some &#x27;hidden preference&#x27; in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.

==Honest signals==


In biology, signals are traits, including structures and behaviours, that have evolved specifically because they change the behaviour of receivers in ways that benefit the signaller. Traits or actions that benefit the receiver exclusively are called &quot;cues&quot;. For example, when an alert bird deliberately gives a warning call to a stalking predator and the predator gives up the hunt, the sound is a &quot;signal&quot;. But when a foraging bird inadvertently makes a rustling sound in the leaves that attracts predators and increases the risk of predation, the sound is not a signal, but a cue.

Signalling systems are shaped by mutual interests between signallers and receivers. An alert bird such as a Eurasian jay warning off a stalking predator is communicating something useful to the predator: that it has been detected by the prey; it might as well quit wasting its time stalking this alerted prey, which it is unlikely to catch. When the predator gives up, the signaller can get back to other tasks such as feeding. Once the stalking predator is detected, the signalling prey and receiving predator thus have a mutual interest in terminating the hunt.

Within species, mutual interests increase with kinship. Kinship is central to models of signalling between relatives, for instance when broods of nestling birds beg and compete for food from their parents.

The term honesty in animal communication is controversial because in non-technical usage it implies intent, to discriminate deception from honesty in human interactions. However, biologists use the phrase &quot;honest signals&quot; in a direct, statistical sense. Biological signals, like warning calls or resplendent tail feathers, are honest if they &quot;reliably&quot; convey useful information to the receiver. That is, the signal trait tells the receiver about an otherwise unobservable factor. Honest biological signals do not need to be perfectly informative, reducing uncertainty to zero; all they need to be useful is to be correct &quot;on average&quot;, so that some behavioural response to the signal is advantageous, statistically, compared to the behaviour that would occur in absence of the signal. Ultimately the value of the signalled information depends on the extent to which it allows the receiver to increase its fitness.

One type of honest signal is the signalling of quality in sexually reproducing animals. In sexually reproducing animals one sex is generally the &#x27;choosing sex&#x27; (often females) and the other the &#x27;advertising sex&#x27; (often males). The choosing sex achieves the highest fitness by choosing the partner of the highest (genetic) quality. This quality cannot be observed directly, so the advertising sex can evolve a signal, which advertises its quality. Examples of these signals include the tail of a peacock and the colouration of male sticklebacks. Such signals only work, i.e. are reliable, if the signal is honest. The link between the quality of the advertising sex and the signal may depend on environmental stressors, with honesty increasing in more challenging environments.

Another type of honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, generally visual, given by poisonous or dangerous animals such as wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness (a conspicuous, non-noxious organism gets eaten). Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.

The mathematical biologist John Maynard Smith discusses whether honest signalling must always be costly. He notes that it had been shown that &quot;in some circumstances&quot; a signal is reliable only if it is costly. He states that it had been assumed that parameters such as pay-offs and signalling costs were constant, but that this might be unrealistic. He states that with some restrictions, signals can be cost-free, reliable, and evolutionarily stable. However, if costs and benefits &quot;vary uniformly over the whole range&quot; then indeed honest signals have to be costly.

==Dishonest signals==

Because there are both mutual and conflicting interests in most animal signalling systems, a central problem in signalling theory is dishonesty or cheating. For example, if foraging birds are safer when they give a warning call, cheats could give false alarms at random, just in case a predator is nearby. But too much cheating could cause the signalling system to collapse. Every dishonest signal weakens the integrity of the signalling system, and so reduces the fitness of the group. An example of dishonest signalling comes from Fiddler crabs such as &quot;Austruca mjoebergi&quot;, which have been shown to bluff (no conscious intention being implied) about their fighting ability. When a claw is lost, a crab occasionally regrows a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. The proportion of dishonest signals is low enough for it not to be worthwhile for crabs to test the honesty of every signal through combat.

Richard Dawkins and John Krebs in 1978 considered whether individuals of the same species would act as if attempting to deceive each other. They applied a &quot;selfish gene&quot; view of evolution to animals&#x27; threat displays to see if it would be in their genes&#x27; interests to give dishonest signals. They criticised previous ethologists, such as Nikolaas Tinbergen and Desmond Morris, for suggesting that such displays were &quot;for the good of the species&quot;. They argued that such communication ought to be viewed as an evolutionary arms race in which signallers evolve to become better at manipulating receivers, while receivers evolve to become more resistant to manipulation. The game theoretical model of the war of attrition similarly suggests that threat displays ought not to convey any reliable information about intentions.

Deceptive signals can be used both within and between species. Perhaps the best-known example of inter-species deception is mimicry: when individuals of one species mimic the appearance or behaviour of individuals of another species. A variety of mimicry types exist, including Batesian, Müllerian, host mimicry and &quot;aggressive&quot; mimicry. A very frequent type is ant mimicry. Deception within species can be bluffing (during contest) or sexual mimicry where males or females mimic the patterns and behaviour of the opposite sex. A famous example is the bluegill sunfish where mimic males look like and behave like females to sneak into the guarded nests of territorial males in order to fertilize some of the eggs.

== Handicap principle ==

In 1975, Amotz Zahavi proposed a verbal model for how signal costs could constrain cheating and stabilize an &quot;honest&quot; correlation between observed signals and unobservable qualities, based on an analogy to sports handicapping systems. He called this idea the handicap principle. The purpose of a sports handicapping system is to reduce disparities in performance, making the contest more competitive. In a handicap race, intrinsically faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles. Similarly, in amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores. This creates correlations between the handicap and unhandicapped performance, if the handicaps work as they are supposed to, between the handicap imposed and the corresponding horse&#x27;s handicapped performance. If nothing was known about two race horses or two amateur golfers except their handicaps, an observer could infer who is most likely to win: the horse with the bigger weight handicap, and the golfer with the smaller stroke handicap. By analogy, if peacock &#x27;tails&#x27; (large tail covert feathers) act as a handicapping system, and a peahen knew nothing about two peacocks except the sizes of their tails, she could &quot;infer&quot; that the peacock with the bigger tail has greater unobservable intrinsic quality. Display costs can include extrinsic social costs, in the form of testing and punishment by rivals, as well as intrinsic production costs. Another example given in textbooks is the extinct Irish elk, &quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot;. The male Irish elk&#x27;s enormous antlers could perhaps have evolved as displays of ability to overcome handicap, though biologists point out that if the handicap is inherited, its genes ought to be selected against.

The essential idea here is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;. In Vonnegut&#x27;s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses a variety of handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. A spectator at a ballet comments: &quot;it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men.&quot; Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to &quot;waste&quot; more of some resource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.
Zahavi&#x27;s conclusions rest on his verbal interpretation of a metaphor, and initially the handicap principle was not well received by evolutionary biologists. However, in 1984, Nur and Hasson used life history theory to show how differences in signalling costs, in the form of survival-reproduction tradeoffs, could stabilize a signalling system roughly as Zahavi imagined. Genetic models also suggested this was possible. In 1990 Alan Grafen showed that a handicap-like signalling system was evolutionarily stable if higher quality signallers paid lower marginal survival costs for their signals.

In 1982, W. D. Hamilton proposed a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He argued that in the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton&#x27;s theory.

Another example is Lozano&#x27;s hypothesis that carotenoids have dual but mutually incompatible roles in immune function and signalling. Given that animals cannot synthesize carotenoids &quot;de novo&quot;, these must be obtained from food. The hypothesis states that animals with carotenoid-depended sexual signals are demonstrating their ability to &quot;waste&quot; carotenoids on sexual signals at the expense of their immune system.

The handicap principle has proven hard to test empirically, partly because of inconsistent interpretations of Zahavi&#x27;s metaphor and Grafen&#x27;s marginal fitness model, and partly because of conflicting empirical results: in some studies individuals with bigger signals seem to pay higher costs, in other studies they seem to be paying lower costs. A possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results is given in a series of papers by Getty, who shows that Grafen&#x27;s proof of the handicap principle is based on the critical simplifying assumption that signallers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency. But the assumption that costs and benefits trade off in an additive fashion is true only on a logarithmic scale; for the survival cost – reproduction benefit tradeoff is assumed to mediate the evolution of sexually selected signals. Fitness depends on producing offspring, which is a multiplicative function of reproductive success given an individual is still alive times the probability of still being alive, given investment in signals.

Later models have shown that the popularity of handicap principle relies on the critical misinterpretation of Grafen&#x27;s model by Grafen himself. Contrary to his claims, his model is not a model of handicap signalling. Grafen&#x27;s key equations show the necessity of marginal cost and differential marginal cost, nowhere in his paper was Grafen able to show the necessity of wasteful equilibrium cost (a.k.a. handicap). Grafen&#x27;s model is a model of condition dependent signalling that builds on a traditional life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival. In general, later models have shown that the key condition of honest signalling is the existence of such condition-dependent trade-off and that the cost of signals can be anything at the equilibrium for honest individuals, including zero or even negative. The reason is that deception is prevented by the potential cost of cheating and not by the cost paid by the honest individuals. This potential cost of cheating (marginal cost) has to be larger than the potential (marginal) benefits for potential cheaters. In turn this implies that the honest peacock or deer need not be wasteful, it will be efficient. It is the potential cheater that needs to be less efficient. Signal selection is not a selection for waste, as claimed by Zahavi, it is guided by the same mechanism - natural selection - as any other trait in nature.

==Costly signalling and Fisherian diploid dynamics==

The effort to discover how costs can constrain an &quot;honest&quot; correlation between observable signals and unobservable qualities within signallers is built on strategic models of signalling games, with many simplifying assumptions. These models are most often applied to sexually selected signalling in diploid animals, but they rarely incorporate a fact about diploid sexual reproduction noted by the mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century: if there are &quot;preference genes&quot; correlated with choosiness in females as well as &quot;signal genes&quot; correlated with display traits in males, choosier females should tend to mate with showier males. Over generations, showier sons should also carry genes associated with choosier daughters, and choosier daughters should also carry genes associated with showier sons. This can cause the evolutionary dynamic known as Fisherian runaway, in which males become ever showier. Russell Lande explored this with a quantitative genetic model, showing that Fisherian diploid dynamics are sensitive to signalling and search costs. Other models incorporate both costly signalling and Fisherian runaway. These models show that if fitness depends on both survival and reproduction, having sexy sons and choosy daughters (in the stereotypical model) can be adaptive, increasing fitness just as much as having healthy sons and daughters.

== Models of signalling interactions ==

Perhaps the most popular tool to investigate signalling interactions is game theory. A typical model investigates an interaction between a signaller and a receiver. Games can be symmetrical or asymmetric. There can be several types of asymmetries including asymmetry in resources or asymmetry of information. In many asymmetric games the receiver is in a possession of a resource that the signaller wants to get (resource asymmetry). Signallers can be a of different types, the type of any given signaller is assumed to be hidden (information asymmetry). Asymmetric games are frequently used to model mate choice (sexual selection) or parent-offspring interactions. Asymmetric games are also used to model interspecific interactions such as predator-prey, host-parasite or plant-pollinator signalling. Symmetric games can be used to model competition for resources, such as animals fighting for food or for a territory.   

== Human honest signals ==
Human behaviour may also provide examples of costly signals. In general, these signals provide information about a person&#x27;s phenotypic quality or cooperative tendencies. Evidence for costly signalling has been found in many areas of human interaction including risk-taking, hunting, and religion.

=== Costly signalling in hunting ===

Large game hunting has been studied extensively as a signal of men&#x27;s willingness to take physical risks, as well as showcase strength and coordination. Costly signalling theory is a useful tool for understanding food sharing among hunter gatherers because it can be applied to situations in which delayed reciprocity is not a viable explanation. Instances that are particularly inconsistent with the delayed reciprocity hypothesis are those in which a hunter shares his kill indiscriminately with all members of a large group. In these situations, the individuals sharing meat have no control over whether or not their generosity will be reciprocated, and free riding becomes an attractive strategy for those receiving meat. Free riders are people who reap the benefits of group-living without contributing to its maintenance. Costly signalling theory can fill some of the gaps left by the delayed reciprocity hypothesis. Hawkes has suggested that men target large game and publicly share meat to draw social attention or to show off. Such display and the resulting favorable attention can improve a hunter&#x27;s reputation by providing information about his phenotypic quality. High quality signallers are more successful in acquiring mates and allies. Thus, costly signalling theory can explain apparently wasteful and altruistic behaviour.

In order to be effective, costly signals must fulfill specific criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers&#x27; phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals make it impossible for low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.
Bliege Bird et al. observed turtle hunting and spear fishing patterns in a Meriam community in the Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains for the amount of time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.

The Hadza people of Tanzania also share food, possibly to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat even though they do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband&#x27;s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality. Frank W. Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Hadza: Hunter-Gatherers of Tanzania&quot; showed that this data confirms that this is also true within the Hadza, based on the documentation on the !Kung, in Megan Biesele&#x27;s book on !Kung folklore, &quot;Women Like Meat&quot;.

Among the men of Ifaluk atoll, costly signalling theory can also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves a great deal of organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men&#x27;s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers&#x27; reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behaviors and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participate on the first day of the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.

In many human cases, a strong reputation built through costly signalling enhances a man&#x27;s social status over the statuses of men who signal less successfully. Among northern Kalahari foraging groups, traditional hunters usually capture a maximum of two or three antelopes per year. It was said of a particularly successful hunter:
:&quot;It was said of him that he never returned from a hunt without having killed at least a wildebeest, if not something larger. Hence the people connected with him ate a great deal of meat and his popularity grew.&quot;
Although this hunter was sharing meat, he was not doing so in the framework of reciprocity. The general model of costly signalling is not reciprocal; rather, individuals who share acquire more mates and allies. Costly signalling applies to situations in Kalahari foraging groups where giving often goes to recipients who have little to offer in return. A young hunter is motivated to impress community members with daughters so that he can obtain his first wife. Older hunters may wish to attract women interested in an extramarital relationship, or to be a . In these northern Kalahari groups, the killing of a large animal indicates a man who has mastered the art of hunting and can support a family. Many women seek a man who is a good hunter, has an agreeable character, is generous, and has advantageous social ties. Since hunting ability is a prerequisite for marriage, men who are good hunters enter the marriage market earliest. Costly signalling theory explains seemingly wasteful foraging displays.

=== Physical risk ===

Costly signalling can be applied to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk-taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates. When those peers are criminals or gang members, sociologists Diego Gambetta and James Densley find that risk-taking signals can help expedite acceptance into the group.

In a study of risk-taking, some types of risk, such as physical or heroic risk for others&#x27; benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk-taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk-taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic risk-taking by male friends as they could be good allies.

In western societies, voluntary blood donation is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk-taking. Costs associated with these donations include pain and risk of infection. If blood donation is an opportunity to send costly signals, then donors will be perceived by others as generous and physically healthy. In a survey, both donors and non-donors attributed health, generosity, and ability to operate in stressful situations to blood donors.

=== Religion ===


Costly religious rituals such as genital modification, food and water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.

Irons proposed that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious behaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These &quot;ostentatious&quot; displays signalled commitment to Islam to strangers and group members. Sosis demonstrated that people in religious communities are four times more likely to live longer than their secular counterparts, and that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of costly requirements demanded from religious community members. However, confounding variables may not have been excluded. Wood found that religion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within a community, where costly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control among committed members. Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members. Despite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish that membership in these clubs is actually worth the entry costs imposed.

Despite the experimental support for this hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that people are more likely to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well-being, although both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.

=== Language ===
Some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant. &quot;Ritual/speech coevolution theory&quot; views rituals as costly signals that ensures honesty and reliability of language communication. Scholars in this intellectual camp argue that even chimpanzees and bonobos have latent symbolic capacities that they rarely—if ever—use in the wild. Objecting to the sudden mutation idea, these authors state that even if a chance mutation were to install a language organ in an evolving bipedal primate, it would be adaptively useless. A very specific social structure—one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust—must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on &quot;cheap signals&quot; (words) an evolutionarily stable strategy.

<doc id="1318180" wikidata="Q4708369" url="?curid=1318180" title="Alaric Alexander Watts">
<text>Alaric Alexander Watts (16 March 1797 – 5 April 1864) was a British poet and journalist, born in London. His life was dedicated to newspaper creation and editing, and he was seen as a conservative writer. It led him to bankruptcy, when a pension was awarded to him by a friend, Lord Aberdeen.

He may now be best remembered for his alliterative poem &quot;The Siege of Belgrade&quot;, which begins with a much-quoted couplet:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;An Austrian army, awfully arrayed,
&quot;Boldly by battery besieged Belgrade.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Life as a journalist==

Alaric Watts was the son of John Mosley Watts and grandson of William Watts, a Leicester physician of repute. After leaving school he made his living as a teacher for a short time, and in 1818–19 was part of the staff of the &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; in London. At about the same time he became a contributor to the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;.

In 1822, leaving his position at the Gazette, he was made editor of the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; (1822–23), in the columns of which he was one of the first to advocate measures for protecting workers in factories against accidents from machinery (see occupational safety). In 1823 he published his first volume of verse, &quot;Poetical Sketches&quot;, and in 1824 he became the editor of the &quot;Literary Souvenir&quot; (till 1838), of which he also became the proprietor two years later. During his ownership he secured the co-operation of some of the most famous men of letters of that period. In 1825 he went to Manchester as editor of the &quot;Manchester Courier&quot;, a position which he resigned a year later. He bought &quot;The Literary Magnet&quot; around December 1825, first making an unnamed &quot;very clever young literary friend&quot; the editor, before taking over as the anonymous editor from July 1826 to December 1827. Under his ownership, &quot;The Literary Magnet&quot; changed its emphasis from prose to poetry, and he managed to get contributions from a number of popular poets of the day, including John Clare, Mary Howitt, Thomas Hood, Felicia Hemans, and his brother-in-law Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen.

In 1827 he assisted in founding the &quot;Standard&quot; as a sub-editor, while the first editor was Stanley Lees Giffard; and in 1833 he started the &quot;United Service Gazette&quot;, which he edited for eight years. In 1839 he helped Lady Bulwer with a manuscript of &quot;Cheveley&quot; and during that time he offered her to stay some time at his cottage. During the same year he returned to the &quot;Standard&quot; as an editor and took a job at the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; where he worked until 1846.

==Later life==

Watts met and married Priscilla &quot;Zillah&quot; Maden Watts () in the early 1820s. The couple had a child, Alaric Alfred, in 1825. Mrs Watts also published and wrote for newspapers and magazines like &quot;The New Year&#x27;s Gift and Juvenile Souvenir&quot; (1829–36) until she died in 1873.

Watts was involved with a number of provincial Conservative newspapers which were not financially successful. In 1848, he was sentenced for some time in debtors&#x27; prison; in 1850 he declared bankruptcy. In 1854, Lord Aberdeen came to his rescue by awarding Watts a civil service pension. In 1856 he was back to editing, publishing the first issue of &quot;Men of the Time&quot;.

Watts died in London on 5 April 1864 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery, against the northern boundary wall (above the catacombs). His poems were collected as &quot;Lyrics of the Heart&quot; and published in 1850. In 1867 a collection of his poems was published in a volume titled &quot;The Laurel and the Lyre&quot;.

<text>Edwin Waugh (1817–1890) was an English poet.

==Life==
The son of a shoemaker, Waugh was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, England and, after some schooling, was apprenticed to a printer, Thomas Holden, at the age of 12. While still a young man he worked as a journeyman printer, travelling all over Britain, but eventually returned to his old job in Rochdale.

Waugh read eagerly, and in 1847 became assistant secretary to the Lancashire Public School Association and went to work in Manchester. In Manchester he started publishing descriptions of rural rambles, and the reception of his works encouraged him to persevere. By 1860 he was able to become a full-time writer; but in 1881 he was in poor health and was granted a Civil List pension of £90 p.a.

==Death and legacy==
Waugh died at his home in New Brighton, Cheshire, in 1890 and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s churchyard on Kersal Moor. Waugh&#x27;s Well was built in 1866 to commemorate him at Foe Edge Farm, on the moors above Edenfield, Rossendale where he spent much time writing. Foe Edge, was demolished by the North West Water Authority in the mid-1970s and no trace remains of the building. There is a monument in Broadfield Park, Rochdale which commemorates Margaret Rebecca Lahee, Oliver Ormerod, John Trafford Clegg and Edwin Waugh.

==Works==
Waugh first attracted attention with sketches of Lancashire life and character in the &quot;Manchester Examiner&quot;. His first book &quot;Sketches of Lancashire Life and Localities&quot; was published in 1855 while he was working as a traveller for a Manchester printing firm. He wrote also prose: &quot;Factory Folk&quot;, &quot;Besom Ben Stories&quot;, and &quot;The Chimney Corner&quot;. His Lancashire dialect songs, collected as &quot;Poems and Songs&quot; (1859), brought him local fame. He has been called &quot;the Lancashire Burns.&quot; His most famous poem is &quot;Come whoam to thi childer an&#x27; me&quot;, 1856.

<text>William Webbe (fl. 1568–1591) was an English critic and translator. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and was a tutor for distinguished families, including the two sons of Edward Sulyard of Flemyngs, Essex, and later the children of Henry Grey of Pirgo, also in Essex.

Webbe wrote a &quot;Discourse of English Poetrie&quot; (1586), dedicated to Sulyard, in which he discusses prosody and reviews English poetry up to his own day. He argued that the dearth of good English poetry since Chaucer&#x27;s day was not due to lack of poetic ability, or to the poverty of the language, but to the want of a proper system of prosody. He decried rhyming verse, showed enthusiasm for Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot;, and urged the adoption of hexameters and sapphics for English verse

He also translated Virgil&#x27;s first two &quot;Eclogues.&quot; A letter by Webbe to Robert Wilmot (fl. 1568–1608) is prepended to the 1591 edition of Wilmot&#x27;s play &quot;Tragedie of Tancred and Gismund&quot;. The letter, praising Wilmot for having decided to publish the tragedy, acts as a prefacing endorsement of the play.

<text>Augusta Webster (30 January 1837 – 5 September 1894) born in Poole, Dorset as Julia Augusta Davies, was an English poet, dramatist, essayist, and translator. She is known for her translations of the works of Aeschylus and Euripides.

==Biography==
Augusta was the daughter of Vice-admiral George Davies (1800-1876) and Julia Hume (1803-1897), the fourth daughter of Joseph Hume of Somerset House. She spent her younger years on board the ship, the Griper&quot;,&quot; her father, as lieutenant of the coast guard at that time, held command. After her father&#x27;s appointment to the rank of commander in 1842, Webster resided for six years in Banff Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Later, following a short time in Penzance, Cornwall, in 1851 Webster resettled in Cambridge, as her father became the chief constable of Cambridgeshire.

She self-studied Greek, Italian and Spanish at home, taking a particular interest in Greek drama, and went on to study at the Cambridge School of Art. During a brief residence in Paris and Geneva, she acquired a &#x27;full knowledge&#x27; of the French language. She published her first volume of poetry in 1860 under the pen name Cecil Homes.
In 1863, she married Thomas Webster, a fellow and lecturer in Law at Trinity College, Cambridge. They had a daughter, Augusta Georgiana, who married Reverend George Theobald Bourke, a younger son of the Joseph Bourke, 3rd Earl of Mayo.

Much of Webster&#x27;s writing explored the condition of women, and she was a strong advocate of women&#x27;s right to vote, working for the London branch of the National Committee for Women&#x27;s Suffrage. She was the first female writer to hold elective office, having been elected to the London School Board in 1879 and 1885. In 1885 she travelled to Italy in an attempt to improve her failing health. She died on 5 September 1894, aged 57.

During her lifetime her writing was acclaimed and she was considered by some the successor to Elizabeth Barrett Browning. After her death, however, her reputation quickly declined. Since the mid-1990s she has gained increasing critical attention from scholars such as Isobel Armstrong, Angela Leighton, and Christine Sutphin. Her best-known poems include three long dramatic monologues spoken by women: &quot;A Castaway&quot;, &quot;Circe&quot;, and &quot;The Happiest Girl In The World&quot;, as well as a posthumously-published Sonnet Sequence, &quot;Mother and Daughter&quot;, of which her only child, Augusta, is its subject.

She died on 5 September 1894 and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery. Her grave (plot no.8187), which is situated above the cuttings catacombs, has suffered badly from tree roots.

<doc id="1318199" wikidata="Q6036939" url="?curid=1318199" title="Inquizition">
<text>Inquizition is an American game show. Created by Sande Stewart Television, it aired on Game Show Network (GSN) from October 5, 1998 to October 19, 2001. The game, hosted by an unknown figure named &quot;The Inquizitor&quot;, featured four contestants competing in a quiz competition against four home viewers who participated by telephone calls.

==Gameplay==
Four players competed in a studio which, from the opening credits sequence, appeared to be a large airplane hangar. In reality, the show was recorded in a small studio, using a blue screen backdrop on which images of the hangar were superimposed. Additionally, four more contestants played along at home against each other in a parallel game over the telephone (one of several shows on GSN that did this). Studio players wore black T-shirts under smocks in various colors, and would bow to the Inquizitor when first introduced.

The game was played in three rounds, each consisting of approximately 20-25 multiple-choice questions depending on the time available. Each question had three possible answers (A, B, or C; &quot;C&quot; was almost always &quot;none of the above&quot;). The contestants had three seconds to lock in an answer by pressing one of the buttons on their podiums, their answers visible only to the Inquizitor and viewing audience. Each correct response awarded one point, with no penalty for wrong answers; the scores were displayed on the podiums after each question, but were not announced at any point during gameplay.

When time expired at the end of each round, the contestant with the lowest score was eliminated and dismissed by the Inquizitor. The losing player turned around, as if to walk away, and the screen faded to white. The scores were reset for each new round. After Round 3, the remaining contestant collected his/her &quot;papers&quot; (a prop sometimes seen briefly on-camera, similar to a diploma) and a $500 cash prize ($250 in Season 1). Telephone contestants played for the same prize as the studio contestants, with some also winning online gift certificates.

In the case of a tie in either the show or the telephone game, additional questions were asked until the tie was broken.

==The Inquizitor==
&quot;Inquizition&quot;&#x27;s mysterious anti-host, the Inquizitor, was not a typical game show host of the time – he was angry, cranky, and had little patience for wrong answers. He rarely called contestants by their first names, instead opting to use a more gentlemanly approach (&quot;Mr. Roberts&quot;, &quot;Miss Johnson&quot;). During the game, he was seen only from behind as a figure in a dark business suit with shoulder-length gray hair, seated in a chair next to a table that held a glass of water and an hourglass.

Frequently, the Inquizitor would express his disdain for under-performing players during questioning and prod them to improve their game – or occasionally praise a player, while giving backhanded insults to the others.

The Inquizitor&#x27;s remarks could have an effect on gameplay, as they were the only indication contestants had of where they stood against their opponents. At the end of each round, the Inquizitor dismissed the player in last place with annoyance or indifference (&quot;Please leave now.&quot;; &quot;Goodbye.&quot;; &quot;Get out!&quot;), and usually scorned the eliminated player in Round 3 by shouting &quot;You have failed!&quot; The eliminated player would turn their back to the camera as they left, and the screen faded to white (instead of black).

At the end of the show, the Inquizitor would walk out of the hangar and cackle menacingly.

===Identity===
The Inquizitor never showed his face during the show&#x27;s three-year run. His identity remained unknown for many years because of stipulations in his contract. In 2024, show creator Sande Stewart revealed he was played by actor William H. Bassett.

<doc id="1318222" wikidata="Q1674893" url="?curid=1318222" title="Istvan Kantor">
<text>Istvan Kantor (aka &quot;Monty Cantsin&quot;, and &quot;Amen!&quot;) (; born August 27, 1949, Hungary) is a Canadian performance and video artist, industrial music and electropop singer, and one of the early members of Neoism.

==Life==
Kantor was born in Hungary on August 27, 1949. In the 1970s, he studied medicine, but also participated in the underground arts scene of communist Budapest that centered on the art historian .

==Work==

===Early work===
In 1976, at the Young Art Club in Budapest, Cantsin met the American prankster and mail artist David Zack. Zack suggested the idea of adopting the multiple identity Monty Cantsin, which Kantor accepted, to the extent that it became chiefly associated with him. Returning to Montreal, he organized a Mail Art show, &quot;The Brain in the Mail&quot;, and in 1979 founded the Neoism movement. Soon afterwards, Neoism expanded into an international subcultural network that collectively used the Monty Cantsin identity.

===Blood performances===
Kantor&#x27;s own work in the late 1970s and early 1980s consisted most notably of the &quot;Blood Campaign&quot;, an ongoing series of performances in which he takes his own blood and splashes it onto walls, canvases or into the audience. At the same time, he continued to work within the Neoist network, co-organizing and participating in a series of Neoist festivals, which began as &quot;Apartment Festivals&quot;, which were also called simply &quot;APTs&quot;.

His more controversial works involve vandalism and gore, painting large X&#x27;s in his own blood on the walls of modern art museums including next to two Picasso paintings at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1988 and at the Jeff Koons retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 2016. In doing so he has been banned from some art galleries, a status he holds with pride. In 2004, he threw a vial of his own blood on a wall beside a sculpture of Michael Jackson by Paul McCarthy in the Hamburger Bahnhof contemporary art museum of Berlin. Although his later work has been dismissed as a simple vandalism by some parts of the media. Curator Laura O&#x27;Reilly, commenting on Istvan Kantors writing &quot;Monty Cantsin&quot; on a piece by artist Nelson Saiers in the Hole Shop gallery in New York, said &quot;There&#x27;s a fine line between pissing on someone else&#x27;s piece as a form self expression – if you&#x27;re going to call that art.&quot;

===Robotic art===
Past work also includes noise installations and performances with electrically modified file cabinets. He also founded the &quot;Machine Sex Action Group&quot; which realizes theatrical cyber-futuristic body performances in an S/M style. The human body in its relation to machines, explored both in its apocalyptic and subversive potentials remains a major theme of his work.

==Awards==
In March 2004 he was awarded the Canadian Governor General&#x27;s Award in Visual and Media Arts.

<doc id="1318227" wikidata="Q2001617" url="?curid=1318227" title="Geography of Asia">
<text>Geography of Asia reviews geographical concepts of classifying Asia, comprising 58 countries and territories.

== Geographical characteristics ==
=== Boundary ===
The area of Asia is not the sum of the areas of each of its regions, which have been defined independently of the whole. For example, the borders of South Asia and West Asia depend on who is defining them and for what purpose. These varying definitions are not generally reflected in the map of Asia as a whole; for example, Egypt is typically included in the Middle East, but not in Asia, even though the bulk of the Middle East is in Asia.

The demarcation between Asia and Africa is the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Suez, the Red Sea, and the Bab-el-Mandeb.

The border with Europe starts with the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, even though Turkey in the Near East extends partly into the Aegean Islands and includes Istanbul on the European side of the Bosphorus. On the north the boundary between the continents of Asia and Europe is commonly regarded as running through the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus, the Black Sea, the Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, the Ural River to its source, and a long border generally following the eastern side of the Ural Mountains to the Kara Sea, Russia. The Arctic Ocean is the northern border. The Bering Straits divide Asia from North America.

On the southeast of Asia are the Malay Peninsula (the limit of mainland Asia) and Indonesia (&quot;Isles of India&quot;, the former East Indies), a vast nation among thousands of islands on the Sunda Shelf, large and small, inhabited and uninhabited. Australia nearby is a different continent. The Pacific islands northeast of Australia more remotely removed from Japan and Korea are Oceania rather than Asia. From Indonesia the border runs along the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea. Most of the islands in the Indian Ocean are Asian.

=== Overall dimensions ===
Multiple sources give different estimates of the area enclosed by the imaginary border of Asia. The New York Times &quot;Atlas of the World&quot; gives . &quot;Chambers World Gazetteer&quot; rounds off to , while the &quot;Concise Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; gives . The 2011 Pearson&#x27;s has . The methods of obtaining these figures and exactly what areas they include have not been divulged.

The map surface of mainland Asia is entirely contained within a Geodetic quadrangle formed from segments of latitude going through its north and south extremes and segments of longitude passing through the east and west extremes. Cape Chelyuskin is at 77° 43′ N; Cape Piai in the Malay Peninsula is at 1° 16′ N; Cape Baba in Turkey is at 26° 4′ E; Cape Dezhnyov is at 169° 40′ W; that is, mainland Asia ranges through about 77° of latitude and 195° of longitude, distances of about long by wide according to Chambers, or long by wide according to Pearson&#x27;s.

Indonesia to the southeast, a nation consisting of thousands of islands, adds a significant amount of territory to mainland Asia and extends the extreme Asian latitude further south. The geographic nature of the country raises such questions as whether the sea and the seabed count as Asia. The Australia–Indonesia border is still being negotiated. Currently, a 1997 treaty remains unratified. As there are questions of fishing rights in the waters and mineral rights in the seabed, two different boundaries are being negotiated, one for the water column and one for the seabed. The southernmost seabed boundary is 10° 50&#x27; S, the latitude of Point A3, the Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea common tripoint. The southernmost water column boundary is still further south at Point Z88, 13° 56&#x27; 31.8&quot;.

== European views of Asia ==
=== The geographical or traditional view ===
Medieval Europeans considered Asia as a continent, a distinct landmass. The European concept of the three continents in the Old World goes back to classical antiquity. Definition of continents has long been and remains primarily the realm of geographers, including cultural geographers as well as physical geographers. A wide majority of geographers, in nearly all atlases and many other publications from National Geographic to the CIA World Factbook and Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Geographical Dictionary, define Europe, Asia, and Africa as continents.

==== The Hellenic origin ====
The three-continent system was an idea devised in Archaic Greece, a time of Greek colonial expansion and trade throughout the Mediterranean and the spread of writing again. Writing is a prerequisite of written geography. It had been lost during the preceding Greek Dark Ages, a period of piracy at sea and defensive parochialism on land. The preceding Mycenaean Greece left scant record of some serving women from a locality in the later Asia Minor called Asia. Europe was mainly Greece, while Libya was a small region to the west of Egypt. There was no systematic definition of &quot;continent;&quot; however, the Greek mariners did make a distinction that was to become one: the islands, nēsoi, versus the mainland, ēpeiros. One etymology relates ēpeir- to the same Indo-European root from which English &quot;over&quot; came. The Armenian form means &quot;bank, coast.&quot; The Greek form must be some sort of &quot;overland,&quot; whether continuous land or a coast that looms over. In Latin it became continens terra, &quot;the continuous land,&quot; shortened to just continens, stem continent-.

Most ships of the Archaic Period were not ocean-going. They followed the shores closely, ready to put in at the first sign of trouble. It is not surprising that the first continents were &quot;shores,&quot; as they are in Herodotus, first historian whose works are extant, who relies on earlier geography now missing except for fragments. Asia is defined by two akrai, &quot;bluffs&quot; or &quot;shores.&quot; One runs from Phasis in Colchis (Georgia) at the eastern end of the Black Sea around the coast of Asia Minor to Phoenicia. The second runs from Phoenicia to the Red Sea (the ancient Red Sea comprised also the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean) and from there to India, after which &quot;no man can say what sort of region it is.&quot;
Asia is equal to its shores, which also define Europe and Libya. The northern shore runs eastward along the line if the Phasis and Araxes Rivers; that is, south of the Caucasus Mountains, and around the south of the Caspian Sea. The southern shore continues the Red Sea and the Nile River, as Darius the Great had constructed a canal between them. This division and system was already in place before Herodotus. He professes not to understand it: &quot;I am astonished that men should ever have divided Libya, Asia and Europe as they have, for they are exceedingly unequal.&quot; His astonishment continues: &quot;I cannot conceive why three names, and women&#x27;s names especially, should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality one ... nor can I even say who gives the three tracts [akrai] their names.&quot; Previously he had spoken of two tracts. He says that an alternate northern border is the mouth of the Don River.

Strabo, geographer of the Early Roman Empire, has an explanation of the geography Herodotus found so puzzling. The key is the coast-hugging requirement of most ancient navigation. As the ancient navigator passed under the Rock of Gibraltar on his way into the Mediterranean Sea (&quot;our sea&quot; to those who lived there), two paths appeared to him, the north shore or the south shore. Strabo says:&quot;Now as you sail into the strait at the Pillars, Libya lies on your right hand as far as the stream of the Nile, and on your left hand across the strait lies Europe as far as the Tanais.&quot;
To the ancient navigators of Our Sea, the continents were separated by seas. The canal extended the southern shore into the Red Sea. The symmetry of the scheme was too geometric for the Greeks to resist, as they represented all geographic masses by regular figures if they could. A triangle prevailed in the Greek imagination with points at the Pillars, the Tanais and the Red Sea. As the sides were three shores, the continents were three.
==== Imperial Roman geography ====
The geographer, Claudius Ptolemaeus, distinguishes between geography, which is &quot;a representation in picture of the whole known world,&quot; and chorography (&quot;study of places&quot;), which &quot;treats more fully the particulars.&quot; The idea of the continents is geography and is presented as such. A chorographer in Ptolemy&#x27;s view was the expert in a specific locality, such as a ship captain, a merchant, or a native. Geographers consult them but they do not write geography unless they happen to be both.

Ptolemy was a geographer of the middle Roman Empire, an Egyptian. The idea of the continents preceded the imperial Romans but through them reached to modern time to determine today&#x27;s geographic views, which are enhancements and refinements of the classical. Stating that &quot;continents are bounded more properly, when it is possible, by seas than by rivers,&quot; Ptolemy defines a three-continent system: Europe, Libya, Asia. His Libya is the North Africa of today, containing a province, Africa, whose name replaced Libya. Rejecting the Nile River as the Asian border so as not to split Egypt, Ptolemy designates the Red Sea as the border between Libya and Asia. In the north, the border between Asia and Europe is a meridian through the mouth of the Don River northward &quot;to the unknown region.&quot; Asia Minor remains &quot;Asia properly so called.&quot;

Ptolemy&#x27;s Asia extends to the Far East, approximately identical to today&#x27;s Asia, except that the European border runs through the future location of Moscow, then a wilderness of forest skirted by Sarmatian tribesmen. In a striking foreshadowing of European and Asian Russia, European Sarmatia lies between the Vistula River and the Don River, while Asiatic Sarmatia runs east of the Don to Scythia.

=== Geologic view ===
The relatively recent study of plate tectonics has discovered that Asia has several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if strictly geologic and tectonic criteria were used (for example, South Asia and East Asia). Definition of &quot;continental plates&quot; is the realm of geologists. Strictly in terms of geological landmasses or tectonic plates, Europe is a western peninsula of Eurasia and of the Africa-Eurasia landmass. In the latter, Europe and Asia are parts of the Eurasian Plate, which excludes the Arabian and Indian tectonic plates.

=== Regional view ===
In human geography, there are several schools of thought. The more common school follows historical convention and treats Europe and Asia as different continents, categorizing East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East as specific regions for more detailed analysis. Other schools equate the word &quot;continent&quot; to geographical &quot;region&quot; when referring to Europe and Asia in terms of physical geography. 

=== Ethnic view ===
In European languages, the term &quot;Asian&quot; more commonly refers to ethnic heritage rather than a strict geographic area. In American English, &quot;Asian&quot; often refers to East and Southeast Asians, while in British English, Asian often refers to South Asians. See the List of transcontinental countries for further geographic definitions. The term Asia Pacific generally refers to a combination of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and islands in the Pacific Ocean – and most are also considered part of Australasia or Oceania. Asia contains the Indian subcontinent, Iranian Plateau, Arabian Peninsula, as well as a piece of the North American plate in Siberia.

== Regions ==
Since the 18th century, Asia has been divided into several regions and subregions. There has been no universal consensus on the use of these terms.

The six regions of Asia include:

; Central Asia
: Commonly understood as comprising the former Soviet Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
; East Asia
: Commonly understood as comprising China, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Macau (China), Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and &quot;Taiwan&quot;. Greater China (Mainland China, the two special administrative regions of China, and the Taiwan Area) comprises the bulk of this region. Mainland China can be further subdivided into five smaller subregions: China proper, Inner Mongolia, Northeast China (a.k.a. Manchuria), Tibet, and Xinjiang (a.k.a. Chinese Turkestan or East Turkestan). A common synonym for East Asia is Northeast Asia, although some geographers only include the Japanese Archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, the Mongolian Plateau, and the Northeast China Plain, as well as the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East (a part of Siberia) in this region.
; North Asia
: Commonly understood as comprising Siberia (Russia), which is also a common synonym for North Asia.
; South Asia
: Commonly understood as comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the British Indian Ocean Territory (United Kingdom), India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. A common approximate synonym for South Asia is the Indian subcontinent which excludes Afghanistan.
; Southeast Asia
: Commonly understood as comprising the ASEAN countries of Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. This region can be further subdivided into two smaller subregions: Mainland Southeast Asia (a.k.a. the Indochinese Peninsula) and Maritime Southeast Asia (a.k.a. the Malay Archipelago).
; West Asia
: Commonly understood as comprising &quot;Abkhazia&quot;, Akrotiri and Dhekelia (United Kingdom), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, &quot;Northern Cyprus&quot;, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sinai (Egypt), &quot;South Ossetia&quot;, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Common synonyms for West Asia are the Middle East, the Near East, and Southwest Asia. The Middle East generally includes Egypt (a transcontinental country between Africa and Asia) but excludes the South Caucasian countries.

== General data for countries defined as Asian by the UNSD ==
The United Nations Statistics Division, charged with collecting statistical data on global regions including Asia, publishes a classification standard, United Nations M49, which assigns code numbers to continental regions, areas and countries, based on statistical purposes, and the countries and regions grouped together don&#x27;t imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliations between the grouped countries. Some general data on the countries listed in M49 for the continental region, Asia (142), and one non-official region, &quot;Northern Asia,&quot; are presented below.

M49 is a device for collecting useful statistics for the UNSD and is a suggested reference guide offered as a global standard for all agencies and institutions within the various UN departments that might be interested. The United Nations Statistics Division does not present it as an authoritative standard or as one that is more valid or more worthy of adoption than some other. It is not a requirement for other agencies within the United Nations, which use their own standards as are convenient for their operations.

No nations have adopted M49 as a mandatory standard. It does, however, reflect general usage concerning the political geography of Asia. M49 is updated frequently to reflect changing geopolitical circumstances.

One problematic aspect of the classification of Asia not yet definitively addressed by the Statistics Division is &quot;Northern Asia,&quot; which has no regional code and is not currently officially a region of Asia. Russia, or &quot;the Russian Federation,&quot; is a nation of Europe. The &quot;Northern Asia&quot; name is unofficially recognized; for example, the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names includes an Eastern Europe, Northern and Central Asia Division. &quot;Northern Asia&quot; comes from traditional usage, which divides Europe from Asia at the Ural Mountains. No one at the UN is suggesting that European Russia be included in Asia or that Asian Russia be included in Europe. Their policy is that a nation shall appear once in one region. They have selected Europe. The problem remains unsolved.
=== Geopolitical map of Asia ===
The nations of this map with one major exception (and a few minor ones) are those defined by The World Factbook. Short forms of the names are used; sometimes abbreviations. All the nations can be found in the table below. The one major exception to the scheme is &quot;Russia,&quot; not currently officially in the continental region of Asia, but unofficially partly in it even though classified as Europe.


=== Geopolitical data for Asia ===
==== Introduction ====
The countries in this table are categorised mainly, but not entirely, according to the UNSD scheme for statistical purposes used by the United Nations Statistics Division. For example, the UNSD statistical geoscheme does not recognize a &quot;North Asia,&quot; but problematic differences in point of view reach down to the country level elsewhere as well. Part of Egypt (Sinai Peninsula) is geographically in West Asia, and the Australian external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are often associated with Asia. However, these are not present in the UNSD geoscheme.

There is no universally defined standard Asia. Traditional views are approximate at best. Even today borders are still being defined, as between Indonesia, Australia and Oceania. As long as conflict over territory remains a human trait there may well be &quot;an eastern question,&quot; as the British Empire said of the Ottoman Empire.

In evaluating the geographic position of nations of the edge of Asia some writers utilize the amorphous concept of &quot;transcontinental countries,&quot; which has different meanings to different authorities. Merriam-Webster defines it as &quot;going across a continent,&quot; as might a railroad. With regard to Asia, there is only one such country, the Russian Federation.

In a second definition, Petrovsky refers to a new tendency to form transcontinental agencies, meaning agencies whose jurisdictions cross continental borders, rather than the whole continent. Petrovsky&#x27;s examples put together widely scattered sections of continents. There is no question of their trans- status. More precise views, however, require definitions of continents, which in the case of Asia are not quite so facile.

A third definition emphasizes transformation in place from one continent to another. Fahey at first defines Turkey as transcontinental by virtue of being in both Anatolia and the Balkans, neglecting the historical circumstance that the Balkans as part of the Ottoman Empire were once Asian, as was much of North Africa. He then hypothesizes that Turkey, accepted into the European Union, is defined by that circumstance to be European. By this usage, the very region to which &quot;Asia&quot; was first applied is now Europe. If it is, Turkey cannot be transcontinental by being split between two continents. This sort of paradox only underlines that Asia has no precise definition in the same way that nations do, to whom a mere 100 yards of border may be of great concern.

Data included in the table below are per sources in linked articles when available, the CIA World Factbook when not. No attempt is made to split populations. That of Russia is for the whole country; thus, the populations and areas cannot be summed to produce those of any defined Asia. The notes state which nations might be considered transcontinental by some agency, but there is little agreement generally.

<text>Fernando Fernández-Savater Martín (born 21 June 1947 at Basque city of San Sebastián) is a Spanish philosopher, essayist and author.

== Early years and career ==
Born in San Sebastián, he was an Ethics professor at the University of the Basque Country for over a decade. Presently he is a Philosophy professor at the Complutense University of Madrid. He has won several accolades for his literary work, which covers issues as diverse as contemporary ethics, politics, cinema and literary studies. In 1990, Savater and columnist and publisher, Javier Pradera, founded the magazine, &quot;Claves de Razón Práctica&quot;.

In November 2012 he was awarded the prestigious Octavio Paz Prize of Poetry and Essay.

In that same year 2012, with issue number 222 (May–June 2012), he became Editor in Chief of &quot;Claves de razón práctica&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Keys for Practical Reason&quot;), a critical thought and cultural crusading review founded by Javier Pradera in 1990, thus giving start to a second era of this prestigious publication, with an editorial board composed of Basilio Baltasar, Francisco Calvo Serraller, Joaquín Estefanía, Carlos García Gual, Santos Juliá and José María Ridao.

== Political activism ==
Savater founded a political party currently disbanded called &quot;Unión, progreso y democracia&quot; (Spanish for Union, Progress and Democracy and often shortened as UPyD) with former socialists MP Rosa Díez, Albert Boadella and Mario Vargas Llosa in order to oppose different nationalist movements in Spanish mainstream politics.

Savater was one of the intellectuals and politicians who endorsed the 2012 manifesto of the &quot;reconversion.es&quot; platform vouching for a recentralization of the country, and considered a precursor of the far-right Vox. In 2018, Savater adhered to the manifesto &quot;Manifiesto por la historia y la libertad&quot; promoted by Francisco Franco National Foundation, decrying the Law of Historical Memory.

He has taken an active part in several organizations engaged with peace in the Basque Country and against terrorism and Basque nationalism, such as &quot;Movimiento por la Paz y la No Violencia&quot;, &quot;Gesto por la Paz&quot;, &quot;Foro Ermua&quot;, and currently &quot;¡Basta Ya!&quot;

== Personal life ==
Savater is also known as a philosophy popularizer, TV host, lecturer and for his political activism. 

He defines himself as an agnostic, an anglophile and a defender of the Enlightenment in the Voltaire tradition.

<text>The San Ysidro McDonald&#x27;s massacre was a mass murder, which occurred at a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego, California, on July 18, 1984. The perpetrator, 41-year-old James Huberty, fatally shot 22 people, including an unborn baby, and wounded 19 others before being killed by a police sniper approximately 77 minutes after he had first opened fire.

At the time, the massacre was the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in U.S. history, being surpassed seven years later by the Luby&#x27;s shooting. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in California.

==Chain of events==
===Prior to incident===
On July 15, 1984, James Huberty commented to his wife, Etna, that he suspected he had a mental health problem. Two days later, on the morning of July 17, he called a San Diego mental health clinic, requesting an appointment. Leaving his contact details with the receptionist, Huberty was assured the clinic would return his call within hours. According to his wife, Huberty sat quietly beside the telephone for several hours, awaiting the return call, before abruptly walking out of the family home and riding to an unknown destination on his motorcycle. Unbeknownst to Huberty, the receptionist had misspelled his name as &quot;Shouberty&quot;. His polite demeanor conveyed no sense of urgency to the operator, and he had elaborated in the phone call that he had never been hospitalized for mental health issues; therefore, the call had been logged as a &quot;non-crisis&quot; inquiry, to be handled within 48 hours.

Approximately one hour later, Huberty returned home in a contented mood. After eating dinner, Huberty, his wife, and their two daughters (aged 12 and 10) cycled to a nearby park. Later that evening, he and Etna watched a film together on their television.

===July 18, 1984===
The following morning—Wednesday, July 18—Huberty, his wife and children visited the San Diego Zoo. In the course of their walk through the zoo, Huberty told his wife of his belief that his life was effectively over. Referring to the mental health clinic&#x27;s failure to return his phone call the previous day, he said, &quot;Well, society had their chance.&quot; After eating lunch at a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in the Clairemont neighborhood of San Diego, the Huberty family returned home.

Shortly thereafter, Huberty walked into his bedroom wearing a maroon T-shirt and green camouflage slacks as his wife lay relaxing upon their bed. He leaned toward Etna and said, &quot;I want to kiss you goodbye.&quot; Etna kissed her husband, then asked him where he was going, stating her intention to soon prepare the family dinner. Huberty calmly replied he was &quot;going hunting... hunting for humans.&quot;

Holding a gun across his shoulder and carrying a box of ammunition and a bundle wrapped in a checkered blanket, Huberty glanced toward his elder daughter, Zelia, as he walked toward the front door of the family home and said &quot;Goodbye. I won&#x27;t be back.&quot;

Huberty then drove down San Ysidro Boulevard. According to eyewitnesses, he drove first toward a Big Bear supermarket and then toward a post office, before entering the parking lot of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant approximately 200 yards (180 m) from his Averil Road apartment.

==Murders==
At approximately 3:56 p.m. on July 18, Huberty drove his black Mercury Marquis sedan into the parking lot of the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant on San Ysidro Boulevard. In his possession were a 9mm Browning HP semi-automatic pistol, a 9mm Uzi carbine, a Winchester 1200 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, and a box and a cloth bag filled with hundreds of rounds of ammunition for each weapon. A total of 45 customers were present inside the restaurant.

Entering the restaurant minutes later, Huberty first aimed his shotgun at a 16-year-old employee named John Arnold from a distance of approximately fifteen feet. As he did so, the assistant manager, Guillermo Flores, shouted: &quot;Hey, John, that guy&#x27;s going to shoot you!&quot; According to Arnold, when Huberty pulled the trigger, &quot;nothing happened.&quot; As Huberty inspected his gun, the manager of the restaurant, 22-year-old Neva Caine, walked toward the service counter of the restaurant in the direction of Arnold, as Arnold—believing the incident to be a distasteful joke—began to walk away from the gunman. Huberty fired his shotgun toward the ceiling before aiming the Uzi at Caine, shooting her once beneath her left eye. Caine died minutes later.

Immediately after shooting Caine, Huberty fired his shotgun at Arnold, wounding the teenager in the chest and arm, before shouting a comment to the effect of, &quot;Everybody on the ground.&quot; Huberty then referred to all present in the restaurant as &quot;dirty swine, Vietnam assholes,&quot; before claiming that he had &quot;killed a thousand&quot; and that he intended to &quot;kill a thousand more.&quot; Upon hearing Huberty&#x27;s profane rant and seeing Caine and Arnold shot, one customer, 25-year-old Victor Rivera, tried to persuade Huberty not to shoot anyone else. In response, Huberty shot Rivera fourteen times, repeatedly shouting &quot;shut up&quot; as Rivera screamed in pain.

As staff and customers tried to hide beneath tables and service booths, Huberty turned his attention toward six women and children huddled together. He first killed 19-year-old María Colmenero-Silva with a single gunshot to the chest, then fatally shot nine-year-old Claudia Pérez in the stomach, cheek, thigh, hip, leg, chest, back, armpit, and head with his Uzi. He then wounded Pérez&#x27;s 15-year-old sister Imelda once in the hand with the same weapon, and fired upon 11-year-old Aurora Peña with his shotgun. Peña—initially wounded in the leg—had been shielded by her pregnant aunt, 18-year-old Jackie Reyes. Huberty shot Reyes 48 times with the Uzi. Beside his mother&#x27;s body, eight-month-old Carlos Reyes sat up and wailed, whereupon Huberty shouted at the baby, then killed him with a single pistol shot to the center of the back.

Huberty then shot and killed a 62-year-old trucker named Laurence Versluis, before targeting a family seated near the play area of the restaurant who had tried to shield their son and his friend beneath the tables with their bodies. Thirty-one-year-old Blythe Regan Herrera had shielded her 11-year-old son, Matao, beneath one booth, as her husband, Ronald, protected Matao&#x27;s friend, 12-year-old Keith Thomas, beneath a booth directly across from them. Ronald Herrera urged Thomas not to move, shielding the boy with his body. Thomas was shot in the shoulder, arm, wrist, and left elbow, but was not seriously wounded; Ronald Herrera was shot six times in the stomach, chest, arm, hip, shoulder, and head but survived; his wife, Blythe, and son, Matao, were both killed by numerous gunshots to the head.

Nearby, three women had also attempted to hide beneath a booth. Twenty-four-year-old Guadalupe del Río lay against a wall; she was shielded by her friends, 25-year-old Gloria Ramírez, and 31-year-old Arisdelsi Vuelvas Vargas. Del Rio was hit several times but was not seriously wounded, Ramírez was unhurt, whereas Vargas received a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. She died of her wound the next day, the only person fatally wounded who lived long enough to reach a hospital. At another booth, Huberty killed 45-year-old banker Hugo Velázquez Vasquez with a single shot to the chest.

The first of many calls to emergency services was made shortly after 4:00 p.m., notifying police of the shooting of a child who had been taken to a post office on San Ysidro Boulevard. The dispatcher mistakenly directed responding officers to another McDonald&#x27;s from the San Ysidro Boulevard restaurant. This error delayed the imposition of a lockdown by several minutes, and the only warnings to civilians near the restaurant were given by passers-by. Shortly after 4:00 p.m., a young woman named Lydia Flores drove into the parking lot. Stopping at the food-pickup window, Flores noticed shattered windows and the sound of gunfire, before &quot;looking up and there he was, just shooting.&quot; Flores reversed her car until she crashed into a fence; she hid in some bushes with her two-year-old daughter Melissa until the shooting ended.

At approximately 4:05 p.m., a Mexican couple, Astolfo and Maricela Félix, drove toward one of the service areas of the restaurant. Noting the shattered glass, Astolfo initially assumed renovation work was in progress and that Huberty—striding toward the car—was a repairman. Huberty fired his shotgun and Uzi at the couple and their four-month-old daughter, Karlita, striking Maricela in the face, arms and chest, blinding her in one eye and permanently rendering one hand unusable. Her baby was critically wounded in the neck, chest and abdomen. Astolfo was wounded in the chest and head. As Astolfo and Maricela staggered away from Huberty&#x27;s line of fire, Maricela gave their baby to her husband. Astolfo handed the shrieking child to a young woman named Lucía Velasco as his wife collapsed against a car. Velasco rushed the baby to a nearby hospital as her husband assisted Astolfo and Maricela into a nearby building. All three members of the Félix family survived.

Three 11-year-old boys then rode their BMX bikes into the west parking lot. Hearing a member of the public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, 74-year-old Miguel Victoria Ulloa, and 69-year-old Aída Velázquez Victoria, walking toward the entrance. As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aída with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported observing Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood from her face, shouting curses at Huberty, who then approached the doorway, swore at Miguel, then killed him with a shot to the head.

=== Police intervention ===
Approximately ten minutes after the first call had been placed to emergency services, police arrived at the correct McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. The first officer on the scene, Miguel Rosario, rapidly determined the location and cause of the actual disturbance and relayed this information to the San Diego Police Department as Huberty fired at Rosario&#x27;s patrol car. Officers deployed immediately imposed a lockdown on an area spanning six blocks from the site of the shootings. The police established a command post two blocks from the restaurant and deployed 175 officers in numerous strategic locations. These officers were joined within the hour by several SWAT team members, who also took positions around the restaurant.

As Huberty was firing rapidly and alternating between firearms, police initially were unaware how many individuals were inside the restaurant. Furthermore, because most of the restaurant&#x27;s windows had been shattered by gunfire, reflections from shards of glass provided an additional difficulty for police focusing inside the restaurant. Initially, police were concerned the gunman or gunmen might be holding hostages, although one individual who had escaped from the restaurant informed police there was a single gunman present in the premises, holding no hostages and shooting any individual he encountered. At 5:05 p.m., all responding law enforcement personnel were authorized to kill the perpetrator(s) should they obtain a clear shot.

Several survivors later reported observing Huberty walk toward the service counter and adjust a portable radio, possibly to search for news reports of his shooting spree, before selecting a music station and further shooting individuals as he danced to the music. Shortly thereafter, Huberty searched the kitchen area, discovering six employees and shouting: &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s more. You&#x27;re trying to hide from me you bastards!&quot; In response, one of the female employees screamed in Spanish, &quot;Don&#x27;t kill me! Don&#x27;t kill me!&quot; before Huberty opened fire, killing 21-year-old Paulina López, 19-year-old Elsa Borboa-Fierro, and 18-year-old Margarita Padilla, and critically wounding 17-year-old Albert Leos. Immediately before Huberty had begun shooting, Padilla grabbed the hand of her friend and colleague, 17-year-old Wendy Flanagan, before the two began to run. Padilla was then fatally shot; Flanagan, four other employees and a female customer and her infant hid inside a basement utility room. They were later joined by Leos, who had crawled to the utility room after being shot five times.

When a fire truck drove within range, Huberty opened fire and repeatedly pierced the vehicle with bullets, slightly wounding one occupant. Hearing a wounded teenager, 19-year-old Jose Pérez, moaning, Huberty shot him in the head; the youth slumped dead beside the booth he had been seated at. Pérez died alongside his friend and neighbor, 22-year-old Gloria González, and a young woman named Michelle Carncross. At one point, Aurora Peña, who had lain wounded beside her dead aunt, baby cousin and two friends, noted a lull in the firing. Opening her eyes, she saw Huberty nearby, staring in her direction. He swore and threw a bag of french fries at Peña, then retrieved his shotgun and shot the child in the arm, neck, and jaw. Aurora Peña survived, although she would remain hospitalized longer than any other survivor.
===End of incident===
At 5:17 p.m., Huberty walked from the service counter toward the doorway close to the drive-in window of the restaurant, affording a 27-year-old police SWAT sniper named Charles Foster—deployed to a strategic position on the roof of a post office directly opposite the restaurant—an unobstructed view of his body from the neck down through the telescopic sight of his .308-caliber rifle. Foster fired a single round from a range of approximately . The bullet entered Huberty&#x27;s chest, severed his aorta just beneath his heart, and exited through his spine, leaving a exit wound and sending Huberty sprawling backwards onto the floor directly in front of the service counter, killing him almost instantly.
Immediately after shooting Huberty, Foster relayed to other responding officers he had killed the perpetrator and that his focus remained on the motionless suspect. Nonetheless, as so many rounds had been expended from different firearms within the restaurant, police were not completely certain the sole perpetrator was deceased. Entering the restaurant approximately one minute later, a police sergeant focused his gun upon Huberty as he noted the movements of a wounded girl. When asked if the deceased male was the suspect, the girl nodded her head.

The entire incident had lasted for 77 minutes, during which time Huberty fired a minimum of 257 rounds of ammunition, killing 20 people and wounding as many others, one of whom was pronounced brain dead upon arrival at hospital and died the following day. Seventeen of the victims were killed inside the restaurant and four in the immediate vicinity. Only 10 individuals inside the restaurant were uninjured—six of whom had hidden inside the basement utility room.

Several victims had tried to their own wounds and/or the wounds of their companions with napkins—often in vain. Of the fatalities, 13 died from gunshot wounds to the head, seven from gunshots to the chest, and one victim, eight-month-old Carlos Reyes, from a single 9mm gunshot to the back. The victims, whose ages ranged from four months to 74 years, were predominantly, though not exclusively, of Mexican or Mexican-American ancestry, reflecting local demographics.

Prior to shooting several of his victims, Huberty had shouted accusations or insults. On one occasion, he had also shouted that he himself did not deserve to live, but that he was taking care of this matter. Although Huberty had repeatedly shouted throughout his shooting spree that he had been a veteran of the Vietnam War, he had never actually served in any military branch.

Initial reports issued by the San Diego Police Department following the massacre indicated that everyone injured or killed within the restaurant had been shot by Huberty in the initial minutes after he had first entered the restaurant. This claim was hotly disputed by survivors, who stated Huberty had shot both wounded and unwounded people over 40 minutes after he had first opened fire.

==Perpetrator==

James Oliver Huberty (October 11, 1942 – July 18, 1984) was born in Canton, Ohio, the second of two children born to Earl Vincent, a quality inspector, and Icle Evalone Huberty, a homemaker. Both parents were devoutly religious, and the family were regular attendees at local United Methodist Churches.

When Huberty was three years old, he contracted polio. To minimize the of this ailment, he was required to wear steel-and-leather braces upon both legs. Although Huberty made a progressive recovery from this ailment, he would be afflicted with a mild limp for the remainder of his life.

In 1950, Earl Huberty purchased a farm in Mount Eaton. Icle refused to live in a rural location, and refused to even view the property. Shortly thereafter, Icle abandoned her family to perform sidewalk preaching as a Pentecostal missionary in Tucson, Arizona. Huberty found his mother&#x27;s abandonment emotionally devastating; his father would later recollect finding his son slumped against the family chicken coop, sobbing.
Huberty was a sullen child with few friends, whose primary interest was target practice. A family acquaintance would later describe him as a &quot;queer little boy who practised incessantly with a target pistol.&quot; By his teens, Huberty was something of an amateur gunsmith. Due to his limp, his family&#x27;s extreme religious beliefs, and his reluctance to socialize with his peers, Huberty was frequently targeted by bullies at Waynedale High School. An average scholar, he graduated 51st out of a class of 77 students in 1960.

In 1962, Huberty enrolled at Malone College, where he initially studied sociology, before opting to study at the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science. He graduated with honors from this institute in 1964, being issued with a funeral director&#x27;s license and, the following year, an embalmer&#x27;s license.

===Marriage and employment===
In early 1965, Huberty married Etna Markland, whom he had met while attending Malone College. Shortly after his marriage, Huberty obtained employment at a funeral home in Canton. Although proficient at embalming, Huberty&#x27;s introverted personality made him ill-suited to dealing with members of the public, causing minor conflicts with his superiors. Nonetheless, Huberty worked in this profession for two years before opting to become a welder for a firm in Louisville. He worked for this firm for two years before securing a better-paid position at Babcock &amp; Wilcox in June 1969. Although reclusive and taciturn, Huberty&#x27;s employers considered him a reliable worker. He willingly took overtime, earned promotions and by the mid-1970s, regularly earned between $25,000 and $30,000 per year ($ and $, adjusted for inflation). Shortly after Huberty was hired by this firm, he and his wife moved into a three-story home in an affluent section of Massillon, Ohio. In the winter of 1971, this home was destroyed in a fire. Shortly thereafter, James and Etna bought another house on the same street. They later built a six-unit apartment building on the grounds of their first home, which they managed. Daughters Zelia and Cassandra were born in 1972 and 1974, respectively.

===Domestic violence and temperament===
Huberty had a history of domestic violence, frequently slapping or punching his daughters, holding knives to their throats, or beating his wife. On one occasion, Etna filed a report with the Canton Department of Children and Family Services stating that her husband had &quot;messed up&quot; her jaw, although she later insisted on the majority of occasions he had assaulted her, he struck her only once. Beginning in 1976, Etna repeatedly attempted to persuade her husband to seek counseling to alleviate his sources of stress, although he refused to seek any form of therapy. In personal efforts to pacify her husband&#x27;s temper, anxiety, and general paranoia and to both influence and control his behavior, Etna took great efforts to minimize any possibility of agitating her husband. She also gradually developed a mechanism whereby she claimed to be able to read his future by reading playing or tarot cards. Huberty believed her. Etna&#x27;s readings would produce a temporary calming effect, and Huberty would typically follow the recommendations his wife made in these readings.

To his neighbors and co-workers, Huberty was perceived as a sullen, ill-tempered and somewhat paranoid individual, obsessed with firearms and who harbored a mental tally of every setback, insult, or general source of frustration—real or perceived—against himself or his family within his mind. Occasionally, Huberty would retaliate in response to any real or perceived injustice in an effort to settle what he termed &quot;my debts&quot;, and conflicts with his neighbors would once lead to his detainment on charges of disorderly conduct. On one occasion, he is known to have informed the father of two girls whom he had encouraged his daughters to fight in response to a conflict between the children: &quot;I believe in paying my debts. Both good and bad.&quot;

A conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed survivalist, Huberty believed an escalation of the Cold War was inevitable and that president Jimmy Carter and, later, Ronald Reagan and the United States government were conspiring against him. Convinced of an imminent increase in Soviet aggression, Huberty believed that a breakdown of society was fast approaching, perhaps through economic collapse or nuclear war. He committed himself to prepare to survive this perceived collapse and provisioned his house with ample reserve supplies of non-perishable food and numerous guns—some purchased from co-workers—that he intended to use to defend his home during what he believed was the coming apocalypse. According to one family acquaintance named Jim Aslanes, Huberty&#x27;s home was bedecked with loaded firearms to such a degree that wherever Huberty was sitting or standing within his home, he &quot;could just reach over and get a gun.&quot; Each firearm was loaded, with the safety catch disabled.

===Unemployment and relocation to Tijuana===
In November 1982, Huberty was laid off from his welding job at Babcock &amp; Wilcox, causing him to become despondent over his dire financial situation and general inability to provide for his family. One co-worker would later recollect that, upon being notified of the impending closure of this engineering firm, Huberty had made a comment indicating that if he was unable to provide for his family, he intended to commit suicide and &quot;take everyone with him.&quot; According to Etna, shortly after her husband became unemployed, Huberty began hearing voices. In early 1983, he placed a loaded pistol against his temple, threatening to commit suicide. Etna successfully dissuaded her husband from shooting himself, although he later remarked to her: &quot;You should have let me shoot myself.&quot;

Unable to find lasting employment in Ohio, James and Etna Huberty sold their six-unit apartment building for $115,000 in the spring of 1983. Shortly thereafter, Huberty obtained alternate welding employment with Union Metal Manufacturing Company. This employment lasted five weeks before the closure of the plant. Weeks after he became unemployed, Huberty and one of his daughters were injured in a traffic accident. In the weeks following this accident, Huberty noted an aggravation in neck pains he had endured since childhood. He also noted an occasional, increasing nerve tremor in his hands and arms.

In the summer of 1983, the Hubertys applied for residency in Mexico, believing the money obtained from the sale of their apartment building would financially sustain the family longer in Mexico than in America. Having also sold their home for just $12,000 in cash in September (with the buyer assuming their $48,000 mortgage), Huberty informed family acquaintances of his intentions to relocate his family to Tijuana in search of employment opportunities, confidently stating, &quot;We&#x27;re going to show them who&#x27;s boss.&quot;

When Huberty and his family moved from Ohio to Tijuana, in October 1983, he left all but the most essential of his family&#x27;s possessions in storage in Ohio, but ensured he brought his huge collection of guns, ammunition and survival supplies with him. According to published reports, Huberty&#x27;s wife and daughters embraced their new environs and became friendly with their neighbors, although Huberty—who spoke little Spanish—was sullen and taciturn. Unable to find employment in Tijuana, Huberty quickly regretted his decision to relocate to Mexico. Within three months, the family relocated to San Ysidro: a largely poor district of San Diego just north of the Mexico–United States border which in 1984 had a population of 13,000.

===San Ysidro===
In San Ysidro, the Hubertys rented an apartment within the Cottonwood Apartments as Huberty sought employment. The fact his family were the only Anglo-Americans within this apartment complex irritated Huberty, who was notably rude to his neighbors. Shortly thereafter, Huberty applied to a newspaper advertisement offering security guard training in a federally funded program. He completed this course on April 12 and soon obtained employment with a security firm in Chula Vista, assigned with guarding a condominium complex. The money earned enabled the family to have their furniture shipped from Ohio, and the family relocated to a two-bedroom apartment on Averil Road the same month. The monthly rent for this apartment was $450.

On July 10, Huberty was summarily dismissed from this job; his employers informed Huberty the reasons for his dismissal were his poor work performance and a noted general physical instability.

==Aftermath==
The day after the massacre, reporters visited James Huberty&#x27;s father in Mount Eaton, Ohio, to garner further information about his son. Having discussed his son&#x27;s childhood and the family&#x27;s religious background, Earl Huberty pointed to a painting of a lost sheep by the Jordan River before beginning to weep, informing reporters: &quot;Yesterday was the worst day of my life. I feel so sorry for those people.&quot;
McDonald&#x27;s temporarily suspended all television and radio advertisements in the days following the massacre. In an act of solidarity, arch-rival fast food chain Burger King also temporarily suspended all forms of advertising.

Huberty&#x27;s body was cremated on July 23, 1984. No official religious service was observed throughout this act. His ashes were returned to his widow, and later interred in his home state of Ohio.

In the weeks following the massacre, Huberty&#x27;s wife and daughters received numerous death threats, forcing them to temporarily reside with a family friend. All three would attend counseling sessions for over nine months. Etna Huberty and her daughters initially relocated from San Ysidro to Chula Vista, where Zelia and Cassandra enrolled in school under assumed names. One year later, the family moved to the community of Spring Valley in San Diego County.

Because of the sheer number of victims, local funeral homes had to use the San Ysidro Civic Center to hold wakes for each victim. The local parish, Mount Carmel Church, was forced to hold back-to-back funeral masses in order that each of the dead could be buried in a timely manner.

Several police officers who responded to the scene of the massacre suffered symptoms including sleep withdrawal, loss of memory and guilt in the months following the incident. A study commissioned by the National Institute of Mental Health and conducted by the chief psychologist of the San Diego Police Department in 1985 concluded several officers suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the incident.

The massacre prompted the city of San Diego to assess the tactical methods by which they responded to incidents of this nature and the firearms in the possession of responding officers. The police department increased training for special units and purchased more powerful firearms in order to better equip law enforcement to respond to scenarios of this magnitude. According to one officer, who confessed to having felt &quot;inadequate&quot; because he had been equipped with a .38-caliber revolver on the day of the massacre: &quot;The time had come where you had to have a full-time, committed and dedicated, highly trained, well-equipped team[...] able to respond rapidly, anywhere in the city.&quot;

On August 2, San Diego Police Chief William Kolendar held a press conference to disclose the results of the San Diego Police Department&#x27;s inquiry into their response to the massacre, and the fact an estimated 73 minutes had elapsed between the time the first police officer had arrived at the restaurant and Huberty&#x27;s death. The results of this internal inquiry found that although the arrival of SWAT team members was delayed by rush-hour traffic, the police acted appropriately in their method of response. Kolendar stated any suggestion police should have stormed the restaurant was &quot;ludicrous&quot;, adding that officers had been unable to obtain a clear view of the gunman because windows had been &quot;spider-webbed&quot; by bullet holes, making visibility in direct sunlight difficult. He also emphasized the eight-minute delay between the passing of the instruction authorizing all law enforcement personnel to kill Huberty and his death made no difference to the final death toll. Kolendar finished his report by stating: &quot;I believe the operation was handled the way it should have been handled.&quot; When questioned in regards to the actual motive behind Huberty&#x27;s murder spree, Kolendar dismissed any notion of a racial motive behind the massacre, informing reporters: &quot;He didn&#x27;t like anybody.&quot;

Within two days of the massacre, the restaurant had been refurbished and renovated. The restaurant planned to again open for business in the hope that—as one employee commented—the building would become &quot;just another McDonald&#x27;s.&quot; Following discussions between community leaders and McDonald&#x27;s executives, a decision was reached on July 24 that the restaurant would not reopen. The renovated restaurant was demolished at midnight on September 26. Following the closure and demolition of the restaurant, McDonald&#x27;s donated the ground to the city, with the stipulation that no restaurant be constructed upon the site. For over four years, alternate plans to convert the site into either a memorial park or a shrine to the dead were considered. The land was sold in February 1988 to Southwestern College for $136,000, with the agreement that a area in front of the campus extension the college intended to construct be set aside as a permanent memorial to the 21 victims. McDonald&#x27;s later constructed another restaurant two blocks from the site of the massacre upon West San Ysidro Boulevard. The restaurant chain also announced a commitment to donate $1 million to a survivors&#x27; fund, with Joan Kroc, the widow of McDonald&#x27;s founder Ray Kroc, also adding a personal contribution of $100,000 to assist with burial costs, financial aid for relatives of the deceased, and counseling for survivors. The sum total of donations received by this fund would exceed $1.4 million. Amidst impromptu protests from some San Ysidro residents and donors, Etna Huberty received the first payout from this fund.

A permanent memorial to those killed in the massacre was formally unveiled in 1990. This memorial consists of 21 hexagonal white marble pillars , each bearing the name of a victim. The sculpture was designed by a former Southwestern College student named Roberto Valdes, who said of his inspiration for the design: &quot;The 21 hexagons represent each person that died, and they are different heights, representing the variety of ages and races of the people involved in the massacre. They are bonded together in the hopes that the community, in a tragedy like this, will stick together, like they did.&quot; The monument is located at 460 West San Ysidro Boulevard. Each anniversary of the San Ysidro McDonald&#x27;s massacre sees this monument decorated with flowers. On the three days people of Mexican heritage observe the Day of the Dead, candles and offerings are brought on behalf of the victims.

Several family members of those killed, along with survivors of the massacre, filed lawsuits against McDonald&#x27;s and the San Diego Police Department. These suits were heard in the San Diego County Superior Court. All lawsuits were consolidated and later dismissed before trial on a defense motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs appealed this ruling. On July 25, 1987, the California Court of Appeal affirmed summary judgment for the defendants, ruling McDonald&#x27;s or any other business has no duty of care to protect patrons from an unforeseeable assault by a murderous madman, and the implemented security measures typically used by restaurants to deter criminals, such as guards and closed-circuit television cameras, could not possibly have deterred the perpetrator, as he did not care about his own survival. Furthermore, the San Diego Police Department were also exonerated of any culpability or negligence, with the appellate panel ruling: &quot;In view of the sheer horror of the ordeal, it is difficult to imagine anything the police could have done or failed to do which would have made the risk any greater than that to which (the victims) were exposed before the police arrived.&quot; The final lawsuits were dismissed in August 1991.

In July 1986, Etna Huberty filed a lawsuit against both McDonald&#x27;s and her husband&#x27;s longtime former employer, Babcock &amp; Wilcox. This civil suit—seeking $5 million in damages—asserted her husband&#x27;s murder spree had been triggered by a combination of a poor diet and her husband working around highly poisonous metals without adequate protection over the course of many years. The suit specifically cited that no traces of either drugs or alcohol had been discovered in Huberty&#x27;s body at his autopsy—negating any possibility of his actions being influenced by either factor—and that the alleged accrual of the high levels of lead and cadmium discovered in Huberty&#x27;s body at his autopsy had most likely accumulated via an ongoing exposure to the fumes inhaled during the 13 years he had been employed as a welder (without sufficient respiratory protection) by Babcock &amp; Wilcox, and that a combination of Huberty&#x27;s exposure to these chemicals with his ingesting high levels of monosodium glutamate in the staple McDonald&#x27;s food he had regularly consumed had induced delusions and an uncontrollable rage. This lawsuit was dismissed in 1987. Etna Huberty died of breast cancer in 2003.

Survivor Albert Leos later became a police officer. He served in several police departments in the South Bay region of San Diego County. Leos later joined the San Diego Police Department.

<text>Conrad ( – 10 August 955), called the Red (), was Duke of Lorraine from 944 until 953. He became the progenitor of the Imperial Salian dynasty.

==Life==
He was the son of Werner V (died about 935), a Franconian count in the Nahegau, Speyergau, and Wormsgau territories on the Upper Rhine. His mother presumably was Hicha, a daughter of the Hunfriding duke Burchard II of Swabia and his wife Regelinda of Zürich. The descent of Count Werner V, the first documented Salian, is uncertain; he probably was related to the Frankish Widonid dynasty, his father, Werner IV (Walaho), was married to an unknown sister of King Conrad I of Germany.

In 941, Conrad appeared as his father&#x27;s successor in the Rhenish counties and obtained additional territory in the Wetterau on the right bank of the Rhine. Conrad took his residence at Worms and rivalled with Archbishop Frederick of Mainz for supremacy in Rhenish Franconia. The Salian counts had been able to strengthen their position in the Franconian lands, while their Conradine relatives had failed to maintain the royal dignity upon King Conrad&#x27;s death in 918 and the rise of the Ottonian dynasty. The late king&#x27;s younger brother Eberhard was able to succeed him as Duke of Franconia and was temporarily enfeoffed with the Lotharingian duchy, nevertheless he joined the revolt of Duke Gilbert of Lorraine against the rule of King Otto I of Germany and was killed at the 939 Battle of Andernach.

While Lotharingia passed to Otto&#x27;s younger brother Henry, Conrad the Red remained a loyal supporter of King Otto and acted as Franconian regent after Duke Eberhard&#x27;s death, with some chance to obtain the ducal title. He also helped to ensure the waiver of Lotharingia by the West Frankish king Louis IV and also to uncover a plot by the king&#x27;s brother Henry on Otto&#x27;s life. In turn, the &quot;adolescens&quot; was vested with Lotharingia in 944. Rejected by the local nobility, however, he remained dependent on the king&#x27;s support. About three years later, he married Liutgarde (d. 953), Otto&#x27;s daughter with his first wife Edith of Wessex, a daughter of the English king Edward the Elder. He and Liutgard had one son, Otto of Worms, born in 948, later Duke of Carinthia.

Conrad proved his talent, in 951 he accompanied King Otto on his first Italian campaign and entered into negotiations with King Berengar II, who by his agency appeared at the 952 Imperial Diet in Augsburg and paid homage to the German king. Conrad, however, was duped by his king, when Otto took the occasion to additionally enforce the cession of the Italian March of Verona to his brother Henry. The next year, Conrad therefore joined his brother-in-law, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, in rebellion against King Otto, who, according to the chronicler Widukind of Corvey, bitterly complained about Conrad&#x27;s ingratitude. The revolt reached large circles, it nevertheless was quashed after the insurgents began to deal with hostile Hungarian forces. Liudolf and Conrad were deprived of their duchies at the Diet of Fritzlar and Lotharingia was instead granted to the king&#x27;s own brother, Archbishop Bruno of Cologne, while Conrad was immediately driven out by the local nobles. Eventually, the Salian submitted to Otto at Langenzenn and both were reconciled. Conrad retained his estates; however, he never regained the ducal title. In 954 he participated in a successful campaign of Margrave Gero against the Slavic Ukrani tribes in the Uckerland.

Conrad the Red was killed in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld near Augsburg, while fighting under King Otto as commander of the Franconian contingent against the invading Hungarian forces. According to Widukind of Corvey: 

&quot;Duke Conrad, the foremost of all in combat, suffering from battle fatigue caused by an unusually hot sun, loosened the straps of his armor to catch his breath when an arrow pierced his throat and killed him instantly.&quot;
Conrad&#x27;s body was carried in state to Worms, where he was given a lavish funeral and buried at Worms Cathedral by his son and heir Otto. This kind of extraordinary burial was at this time a privilege of bishops and kings. Conrad was the great-grandfather of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor.

<text>50th Street/Minnehaha Park is a light rail station on the Blue Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.

This station is located on the southwest corner on the intersection of 50th Street with Minnesota State Highway 55 (Hiawatha Avenue), in the Minnehaha neighborhood. This is a side-platform station. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

Early on in the design process, there had been some consideration to use a small existing rail station on the other side of the highway for this stop. The Minnehaha Depot, also known as the &quot;Princess Depot,&quot; had been built in 1875 and was used for a variety of purposes over the years. The Milwaukee Road used it for the majority of the time until it closed in 1963, and it was part of the Twin City Rapid Transit streetcar system for many years.

Just north of this station is a short tunnel under Minnehaha Parkway.

<text>In computing, downgrading refers to reverting software (or hardware) back to an older version; downgrade is the opposite of upgrade. Programs may need to be downgraded to remove introduced bugs, restore useful removed features, and to increase speed and/or ease of use. The same can occur with machinery.

An example of a downgraded program is Gmax, a downgraded version of 3ds max used by professional computer graphics artists, free to download and simplified for ease of use.

The term &quot;downgrade&quot; became especially popularized during the days of Windows Vista, with users wanting to return to, or downgrade to (with some even calling it an &quot;upgrade&quot;) Windows XP due to Vista&#x27;s performance and familiarity issues.

Another reason could be that the user&#x27;s applications do not support their new OS and they want to revert to an older version.

<doc id="1318304" wikidata="Q7072163" url="?curid=1318304" title="O. R. Melling">
<text>Geraldine Valerie Whelan (born 2 December 1952), known by the pen name O. R. Melling, is a writer of fantasy novels, mostly for children and young adults. Melling&#x27;s novels focus on Irish and Celtic folklore. She writes reviews and film scripts as G. V. Whelan. She is sometimes published as Orla Melling.

==Early life and education==
Melling was born in Ireland, but moved with her family to Toronto, Ontario when she was four. Her father was a musician and she had nine brothers and sisters.

Melling was educated at Loretto College School in Toronto. She studied philosophy, Celtic Studies and mediaeval history at Trinity College, University of Toronto.

==Career==

Melling has said that she started writing after dropping out of studying law: &quot;Writing gave me the excuse I needed to leave my law studies&quot;.

Melling has been awarded the Canadian Library Association Young Adult Book Award for &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and the Ruth Schwartz Award for Children&#x27;s Literature. &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Tale&quot; has been translated into Czech and Japanese.

Her influences include Patricia Lynch.

Melling has also worked as a teacher of Irish dance and been an officer in the Royal Canadian Navy.

==Critical response==

The critic Ciara Ní Bhroin has described Melling&#x27;s novels as &quot;weaving ... modern Canadian protagonists into ancient myth&quot;. She identifies a &quot;nostalgic, regressive strain&quot; in &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and writes that &quot;Melling both confirms and denies traditional portrayals of Ireland and the feminine&quot;. Ní Bhroin positions Melling&#x27;s work within Anglo-Irish literature.

==Personal life==
Melling lives in Bray, County Wicklow. She has a daughter.

<doc id="1318313" wikidata="Q549109" url="?curid=1318313" title="Artur Hazelius">
<text>Artur Immanuel Hazelius (30 November 1833 – 27 May 1901) was a Swedish teacher, scholar, folklorist and museum director. He was the founder of both the Nordic Museum (&quot;Nordiska museet&quot;) and the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.

==Background==
Hazelius was born in Stockholm, Sweden as the son of Johan August Hazelius (1797–1871), a Swedish Army officer (with terminal rank of major general), politician and publicist. He entered Uppsala University in 1854, and received his Ph.D. degree in 1860, after which he worked as a teacher, as well as participating in several school-book and language reform projects.

In 1869 Hazelius was the secretary of the Swedish section at the Scandinavian orthographic congress in Stockholm (), and published its proceedings in 1871. The radical reforms in Swedish spelling proposed there sparked opposition from the Swedish Academy. This gave Johan Erik Rydqvist (1800–1877) the energy to publish &quot;Svenska Akademiens Ordlista&quot; (SAOL), the very conservative first edition of the Academy&#x27;s one-volume spelling dictionary in 1874. However, many of the proposals from the congress were introduced in the sixth edition of the same dictionary in 1889 (&quot;e–ä&quot;, &quot;qv–kv&quot;) and the rest (&quot;dt&quot;, &quot;fv&quot;, &quot;hv&quot;) in a spelling reform for Swedish schools, introduced in 1906 by the minister of education Fridtjuv Berg (1851–1916). Berg acknowledged that Hazelius had laid the foundation for all following spelling reforms.

==Career==

During travels in the country, Hazelius noticed how Swedish folk culture, including architecture and other aspects of the material culture, was eroding under the influence of industrialization, migration and other processes of modernity, and in 1872 he decided to establish a museum for Swedish ethnography, originally (1873) called the Scandinavian ethnographic collection (), from 1880 the Nordic Museum (, now ). In 1891 he established the open-air museum Skansen, which became the model for other open-air museums in Northern Europe. He got the idea after a visit to the world&#x27;s first open-air museum, Norsk Folkemuseum, established near Oslo in 1881.

Hazelius was close friends with Swedish pathologist Axel Key, with whom he shared a number of common interests and helped found the museum. The two &quot;won special acknowledgment at the World Exhibition in Paris 1878 where the museum was acclaimed worldwide.&quot; Key also served as chair of the museum&#x27;s board for several years.

For the Nordic museum, Hazelius bought or managed to get donations of objects – furniture, clothes, toys, etc. – from all over Sweden and the other Nordic countries; he was mainly interested in peasant culture but his successors increasingly started to collect objects reflecting bourgeois and urban lifestyles as well. For Skansen he collected entire buildings and farms.

Although the project did not initially get the government funding he had hoped, Hazelius received widespread support and donations, and by 1898 the Society for the promotion of the Nordic Museum () had 4,525 members. The Riksdag allocated some money for the museums in 1891 and doubled the amount in 1900, the year before his death. 
==Personal life==
Hazelius was married to Sofia Elisabeth Grafström (1839–1874), daughter of Anders Abraham Grafström, a historian, priest and member of the Swedish Academy

During the last few years of his life, Hazelius lived at Hazeliushuset, one of the old buildings on Skansen. He died on 27 May 1901, and on 4 February 1902, he was interred in a grave at Skansen.

His only son Gunnar Hazelius (1874–1905) succeeded him as curator of the Nordic Museum. Gunnar Hazelius&#x27;s daughter Gunnel Hazelius-Berg (1905–1997) was later costume and textile historian at the Nordic Museum. Her husband, Professor Gösta Berg (1903–1993) served as director of the Nordic Museum and Skansen from 1956 to 1963 and managing director of the Skansen Foundation from 1964.

<doc id="1318322" wikidata="Q2305975" url="?curid=1318322" title="Callable bond">
<text>A callable bond (also called redeemable bond) is a type of bond (debt security) that allows the issuer of the bond to retain the privilege of redeeming the bond at some point before the bond reaches its date of maturity. In other words, on the call date(s), the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back the bonds from the bond holders at a defined call price. Technically speaking, the bonds are not really bought and held by the issuer but are instead cancelled immediately.

The call price will usually exceed the par or issue price. In certain cases, mainly in the high-yield debt market, there can be a substantial call premium. 

Thus, the issuer has an option which it pays for by offering a higher coupon rate. If interest rates in the market have gone down by the time of the call date, the issuer will be able to refinance its debt at a cheaper level and so will be incentivized to call the bonds it originally issued. Another way to look at this interplay is that, as interest rates go down, the present values of the bonds go up; therefore, it is advantageous to buy the bonds back at par value.

With a callable bond, investors have the benefit of a higher coupon than they would have had with a non-callable bond. On the other hand, if interest rates fall, the bonds will likely be called and they can only invest at the lower rate. This is comparable to selling (writing) an option — the option writer gets a premium up front, but has a downside if the option is exercised.

The largest market for callable bonds is that of issues from government sponsored entities. They own many mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. In the U.S., mortgages are usually fixed rate, and can be prepaid early without cost, in contrast to the norms in other countries. If rates go down, many home owners will refinance at a lower rate. As a consequence, the agencies lose assets. By issuing numerous callable bonds, they have a natural hedge, as they can then call their own issues and refinance at a lower rate.

The price behaviour of a callable bond is the opposite of that of puttable bond. Since call option and put option are not mutually exclusive, a bond may have both options embedded.

==Pricing==
:: price of callable bond = price of straight bond – price of call option;
* Price of a callable bond is always lower than the price of a straight bond because the call option adds value to an issuer.
* Yield on a callable bond is higher than the yield on a straight bond.

<text>Lorenzo &quot;Larry&quot; J. Ponza Jr. (February 15, 1918 – December 15, 2004) was the inventor of the modern baseball pitching machine.

He grew up in the Santa Cruz area of California near a sawmill which was operated by his parents. He graduated from high school in 1934 and, according to him, continued his education in the &quot;School of Hard Knocks and Experience&quot;. In 1941 he moved to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and worked as a senior civilian supervisor for the US Navy&#x27;s production control office.

His first pitching machine, the Power Pitcher, was invented in 1952. He followed this up with many improvements, including the 1974 Hummer, which could simulate fastballs, pop-ups and grounders, the Casey (1983), the Ponza Swing King (1987) and the Rookie (1988). He sold his company to the Athletic Training Equipment Company in the early 1990s.

He died at age 86 from a cancer-related illness. In Argentina, a popular online newspaper, Telégrafo del Sur, published a comic called &quot;The news adventures of Lorenzo Ponza&quot; in honor of him.

<doc id="1318354" wikidata="Q7628770" url="?curid=1318354" title="Stunt (gridiron football)">
<text>A stunt in American football and Canadian football, sometimes called a twist, is a planned maneuver by a pair of players of the defensive team by which they exchange roles to better slip past blockers of the offensive team at the beginning of a play, in order to better rush the passer.

The purpose of a stunt is to confuse opposing blockers, which is an aid to the defense in rushing an opposing forward pass or kick. The main weakness of a stunt is that it is more vulnerable than average to running plays by the opposing team. In most cases, the defense will not use a play incorporating stunting if it expects a running play from the offense.

There are two main types of stunts. In one, a line player, who would otherwise try to charge forward, instead drops back, and a nearby linebacker or defensive back charges forward instead. In the other, which is known as &quot;cross-rushing&quot;, line players, instead of charging straight ahead, cross paths. One of them may follow a looping path that goes behind the other before moving forward (in which case the stunt is called a &quot;loop&quot;), or one may wait for the other to penetrate slightly first, and then cross behind, their paths angling across each other. In some variants, a rushing player will run around more than one rushing teammate.

Because of the exchange of roles, a stunt is sometimes called a &quot;trade&quot;; blockers of the offensive team may engage in similar &quot;trades&quot;. The defensive players involved are said to be stunting or trading, or sometimes to &quot;have a game on&quot;.

The name &quot;stunt&quot; presumably derives from its more general meaning of a showy trick. The term has been used in a football context since at least the 1960s. However, the maneuver itself dates back to the 19th century. Walter Camp wrote of role exchanges between a line player and a &quot;line-half&quot; (then the nomenclature for what is now called a linebacker; presumably a cross between lineman and halfback, or a halfback playing behind the line; cf. &quot;scrum-half&quot; in rugby) in efforts to block a kick from scrimmage, forward passes not yet having been legal.

<text>Eyes on the Prize: America&#x27;s Civil Rights Movement is an American television series documentary about the civil rights movement in the United States. The documentary originally aired on the PBS network, and it also aired in the United Kingdom on BBC2. Created and executive produced by Henry Hampton, and narrated by Julian Bond, the series uses archival footage, stills, and interviews by participants and opponents of the movement. The title of the series is derived from the title of the folk song &quot;Keep Your Eyes on the Prize&quot;, which is used as the opening theme music in each episode.

The series won a number of Emmy Awards, Peabody Awards, and was nominated for an Academy Award.

A total of 20 episodes of &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; were produced in three separate parts. The first part, &quot;Eyes on the Prize: America&#x27;s Civil Rights Years&quot;, chronicles the time period between the United States Supreme Court ruling &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954 and the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965. It consists of six episodes, which premiered on January 21, 1987, and concluded on February 25, 1987. The second part, &quot;Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads&quot;, chronicles the time period from the national emergence of Malcolm X in 1964 to the 1983 election of Harold Washington as the first African-American mayor of Chicago. It consists of eight episodes, which aired from January 15, 1990, to March 5, 1990. The third part, &quot;Eyes on the Prize III: We Who Believe in Freedom Cannot Rest&quot;, chronicles those who work for racial justice from 1977 to 2015. It will premiere on February 25, 2025, on HBO. The documentary was made widely available to educators on VHS tape. 14 hours were re-released on DVD in 2006 by PBS. 

==Broadcast==
The film originated as two sequential projects. Part one, six hours long, was shown on PBS in early 1987 as &quot;Eyes on the Prize: America&#x27;s Civil Rights Years 1954–1965&quot;. Eight more hours were broadcast in 1990 as &quot;Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965–1985&quot;.

In 1992, the documentary was released on home video. By the mid-1990s, both rebroadcasts and home video distribution were halted for several years due to expiration of rights and licenses of copyrighted archive footage, photographs and music used in the series. Copyright holders were demanding increasingly higher rates. Grants from the Ford Foundation and Gilder Foundation enabled Blackside and the rights clearance team to renew rights in 2005. While the return of &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; to public television and the educational market depended on the contributions of many, four individuals in particular are credited with achieving the complicated undertaking of rights renewals and the re-release of the series: Sandra Forman, Legal Counsel and Project Director; Cynthia Meagher Kuhn, Archivist and Rights Coordinator; Rena Kosersky, Music Supervisor; and Judi Hampton, President of Blackside and sister of Henry Hampton. None of the archival material in the fourteen-hour documentary was removed or altered in any way.

PBS rebroadcast the first six hours on &quot;American Experience&quot; on three consecutive Mondays in October 2006, and rebroadcast the second eight hours in February 2008. After a gap of almost eight years, &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; was rebroadcast on World Channel on fourteen consecutive Sundays beginning on January 17, 2016.

PBS reissued an educational version of the series in the fall of 2006, making it available on DVD for the first time. It is now available to educational institutions and libraries from PBS on seven DVDs or seven VHS tapes. A consumer version of part one (1954–1965) was released in March 2010.

The licensing issues from 1993 to 2006 generated what was called Eyes on the Screen, an effort to disseminate the series by file sharing networks without regard to copyright restrictions.

===&quot;America&#x27;s Civil Rights Years 1954–1965&quot;===
===&quot;America at the Racial Crossroads 1965–1985&quot;===
==Book==

The book &quot;Eyes on the Prize: America&#x27;s Civil Rights Years, 1954–1965&quot; was created as a companion volume to the series during post-production by the producers and publishing staff at Blackside, Inc. They were assisted by Juan Williams, a journalist with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. First published by Viking Press in 1987, the book used a portion of the iconic photograph of the Selma to Montgomery march taken by &quot;Look&quot; magazine photographer James Karales on its cover.

==Reception==
The series has been hailed by numerous critics as more than just a historical document.

==Awards==
Both &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; and &quot;Eyes on the Prize II&quot; won Peabody Awards and Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Awards.

The series also won six Emmy Awards.

Episode six, &quot;Bridge to Freedom&quot;, produced by Callie Crossley and James A. DeVinney, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1988 during the 60th Academy Awards.

<text>Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait (February 5, 1819April 28, 1905) was a British-American artist who is known mostly for his paintings of wildlife. During most of his career, he was associated with the New York City art scene.
==Life and Career==

Tait was born in Livesey Hall near Liverpool, England. 
At eight years old, (due to his father&#x27;s bankruptcy) he was sent to live with relatives in Lancaster. It is during that time that he became attached to animals. Later on, in Manchester, England, Agnew &amp; Zanetti Repository of Art acquired Arthur Tait who began self-learning to paint, as a twelve-year-old boy. His work consisted mostly of reproduced lithography that were exposed for Agnew&#x27;s exhibitions. In 1838, he left the Agnew lithography reproduction business to marry.
 During the period 1845-1848 he produced a number of lithographs of railway subjects, with a particular focus on landscapes showing the Lancashire and Yorkshire lines.
During the late 1840s he became aware of the Americas while attending a George Catlin exhibition in Paris. He immigrated to the United States in 1850, where he established a small painting camp in the Adirondacks to paint during summer. Starting in 1852, Currier &amp; Ives reproduced lithographs of his works to publicize him. What also promoted his talent was exhibitions held at the National Academy of Design, New York during the late 19th century showing more than 200 paintings of his. 
In 1858 he was elected to full membership of the Academy.
He was identified with the art life of New York until his death at Yonkers, New York in 1905. He painted barnyard fowl and wild birds as well as sheep and deer, with great dexterity, and reproductions of his minute panels of chickens had an enormous vogue.

In 2006, Tait&#x27;s painting &quot;Good Hunting Ground: The Home of the Deer&quot; was auctioned for $167,300.

He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

<text>Model 204 (M204) is a database management system for IBM and compatible mainframe computers developed and commercialized by Computer Corporation of America. It was announced in 1965, and first deployed in 1972. It incorporates a programming language and an environment for application development. Implemented in assembly language for IBM System/360 and its successors, M204 can deal with very large databases and transaction loads of 1000 TPS. 

==Product description==
Model 204 relies on its own type of bitmap index, originally devised by Bill Mann, and combines the use of hash table, B-tree, and partitioned record list technologies to optimize speed and efficiency of database access.

It has been described as &quot;one of the three major inverted-list [database
systems] ... the other two being&quot; ADABAS and ADR&#x27;s Datacom/DB.

Although M204 is a pre-SQL (and pre-relational) database product, it is possible to manually map the files of an M204 database to approximate SQL equivalents and provide some limited SQL functionality using Model 204 SQL Server.

== Users ==
Model 204 is commonly used in government and military applications. 

It was used commercially in the UK by Marks &amp; Spencer. It was also used at the Ventura County Property Tax system in California, the Harris County, Texas, Justice Information Management System, and in the New York City Department of Education&#x27;s Automate The Schools system. An informal list of past and present Model 204 users, compiled in 2010, identified more than 140 organizations worldwide. Beginning in 1986, it was used by the US Navy Fleet Intelligence Center Europe and Atlantic (FICEURLANT).

Model 204 has been a central part of Australian social security for decades. Services Australia have used it for their ISIS system that pays over $110 billion in welfare payments to around 6 million Australians. A 1.5 billion Australian dollar project to replace ISIS was expected to be completed in 2022 but was delayed. The project was scrapped in July 2023 having spent AUD 191 million, since the replacement system (based on Pegasystems business process automation software) took minutes to complete tasks Model 204 could complete in seconds.

In a 2014 media interview, then Treasurer of Australia Joe Hockey stated that the Australian social security system and the Pentagon were the only remaining active Model 204 customers in the world.

===Corporate information===
Add-on products for Model 204 database were formerly available from Sirius Software, Inc.

Sirius, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, was acquired by Rocket Software in 2012.

<text>Anatoly Ivanovich Maltsev (also: Malcev, Mal&#x27;cev; Russian: Анато́лий Ива́нович Ма́льцев; 27 November N.S./14 November O.S. 1909, Moscow Governorate – 7 June 1967, Novosibirsk) was born in Misheronsky, near Moscow, and died in Novosibirsk, USSR. He was a mathematician noted for his work on the decidability of various algebraic groups. Malcev algebras (generalisations of Lie algebras), as well as Malcev Lie algebras are named after him.

== Biography ==
At school, Maltsev demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics, and when he left school in 1927, he went to Moscow State University to study Mathematics. While he was there, he started teaching in a secondary school in Moscow. After graduating in 1931, he continued his teaching career and in 1932 was appointed as an assistant at the Ivanovo Pedagogical Institute located in Ivanovo, near Moscow.

Whilst teaching at Ivanovo, Maltsev made frequent trips to Moscow to discuss his research with Kolmogorov. Maltsev&#x27;s first publications were on logic and model theory. Kolmogorov soon invited him to join his graduate programme at Moscow State University, and, maintaining his post at Ivanovo, Maltsev effectively became Kolmogorov&#x27;s student.

In 1937, Maltsev published a paper on the embedding of a ring in a field. Two years later, he published a second paper where he gave necessary and sufficient conditions for a semigroup to be embeddable in a group.

Between 1939 and 1941, he studied for his doctorate at the Steklov Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, with a dissertation on the &quot;Structure of isomorphic representable infinite algebras and groups&quot;.

In 1944, Maltsev became a professor at the Ivanovo Pedagogical Institute where he continued to work on group theory and linear groups in particular. He also studied Lie groups and topological algebras. He generalized the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence; his generalization is now known as the Mal&#x27;cev correspondence.

In 1958, Maltsev became an Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
In 1960, he was appointed to a chair in mathematics at the Mathematics Institute at Novosibirsk and chaired the Algebra and Logic Department of Novosibirsk State University. He founded the Siberian section of the Mathematics Institute of the Academy of Sciences, the Siberian Mathematical Society and the journal &quot;Algebra i Logika&quot;. Maltsev also founded the &quot;Algebra and Logic Seminar&quot; attended by his students Igor Lavrov, Larisa Maksimova, Dmitry Smirnov, Mikhail Taitslin, and A. Vinogradov, as well as by Yuri Ershov and others. This seminar, in essence, started a new and extremely fruitful school in model theory and decidability of elementary theories.

During the early 1960s, Maltsev worked on problems of decidability of elementary theories of various algebraic structures. He showed the undecidability of the elementary theory of finite groups, of free nilpotent groups, of free soluble groups and many others. He also proved that the class of locally free algebras has a decidable theory.

Maltsev received many honours, including the Stalin Prize in 1946 and Lenin Prize in 1964. In 1962 he founded the mathematical journal &quot;Algebra i Logika&quot;.

<text>Georgios Karatzaferis (; born August 11, 1947) is a Greek politician, a former member of the Hellenic Parliament and the former president of the Popular Orthodox Rally. Previously, Karatzaferis was a member of parliament of the liberal-conservative New Democracy party. He is a former Member of the European Parliament and former vice-president of the Independence and Democracy group. The Popular Orthodox Rally&#x27;s views, ideas, and electoral campaigns were often broadcast and promoted by the relatively minor private Greek TV channel TeleAsty (former Telecity) and the party&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;A1&quot;, both which he founded. In 2023, he praised Kyriakos Mitsotakis and endorsed New Democracy for the 2023 elections, campaigning for the party, without officially rejoining it.

==Biography and career==
Karatzaferis was born in 1947. In 1977 he founded R.TV.P.R. AE advertising body and he created the &quot;TV Press Video Review&quot; in 1983. In 1990 he established the radio and television stations &quot;Radio City&quot; and &quot;TeleAsty&quot; (the latter was initially known as &quot;TeleCity&quot;).

He received an honours diploma from the London School of Journalism in 1994. He became an editor of the newspaper &quot;Alpha Ena&quot; in 2000. In the beginning of the 1980s he was also a columnist for &quot;Nea Poreia&quot;, the official publication of the political organization to which he belonged and was an MP. He also wrote contributed to daily newspapers including &quot;Eleftheros&quot;, &quot;Apogevmatini&quot;, and &quot;Eleftheros Typos&quot;. In 2005, he founded the Academy of Communications Studies in Athens.

As a member of the Greek Parliament his responsibilities included the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Watchdog Committee, the Public Order Committee and the Press and Mass Media Committee (1993–2000). He was a member of the Committees on Public Administration and Foreign Affairs (1993–2004), Member of the National Communications&#x27; Confidentiality Protection Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Greco Spanish Friendship Association (1999)..

==Controversy==
On different controversial remarks, Georgios Karatzaferis has publicly questioned why Jews did not &quot;come to work on 9/11&quot;, suggesting that they were warned to leave the World Trade Center prior to the attack. He challenged the Israeli ambassador in Greece to come and debate on &quot;the Holocaust, Auschwitz and the Dachau myth&quot; and in 2001 he stated that &quot;the Jews have no legitimacy to speak in Greece and provoke the political world. Their impudence is crass&quot;.

== Legal battles ==
In December 2015, he was sentenced to a suspended one year prison sentence with three years probation, a 10,000 euro fine and an 18-month period of political disenfranchisement, for filing an incomplete statement of assets and income during the years of 2010, 2011 and 2012, while he was in office.

==Books==
Karatzaferis is also the author of five books:

* Το Μοντέλο της Δημοκρατίας - The Model of Democracy
* Η Γυναίκα Σήμερα - The Woman Today
* Η Λιάνη στηρίζει την Aλλαγή - Liani supports the Change
* Αγώνες και Αγωνίες της δεκαετίας 1990-2000 - Struggles and Agonies of the 1990–2000 decade
* Βίοι Αγίων - Biographies of Saints
* Η Λευκή Βίβλος - The White Bible

<doc id="1318410" wikidata="Q2698314" url="?curid=1318410" title="Mario's Tennis">
<text>is a 1995 sports video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Virtual Boy. It was released as a launch title for the Virtual Boy, and later was a pack-in game in North America. It is the first installment of the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; series.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; is a sports game in which the player controls one of seven different &quot;Mario&quot; characters and engages in tennis matches. The action on the court is viewed from directly behind the player character from a third person perspective. The Virtual Boy&#x27;s stereoscopic 3D graphics allow the player to perceive depth within the tennis court, allowing for better perception in the distance between a tennis ball and the respective character. Unlike later entries in the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; series, which added gameplay elements not present in traditional tennis, such as &quot;power up items&quot;, special &quot;power shots&quot;, or external obstacles interfering with the game, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; simply focuses on tennis fundamentals.

&quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; supports a number of different game modes and customization options. The player may choose one of seven &quot;Mario&quot; characters, including Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Toad, Koopa Troopa, and Donkey Kong Jr., all with differing attributes in regards to &quot;speed&quot;, &quot;power&quot; or &quot;racket area&quot;. Either a single game, or a three-game tournament mode may be chosen, both having the option to play either singles or doubles matches on easy, normal, or hard difficulties. Although a two-player function was announced, it was not implemented since the cable required to link two Virtual Boy units was never released.

==Development==
The game initially had a working title of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Dream Tennis&quot; upon its announcement. The game was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1, with director Gunpei Yokoi, the same team that was responsible for the development of the Virtual Boy. His success with the Game Boy line of systems, coupled with the public&#x27;s general belief that it was too early for the next generation of systems, due to the failure of systems such as the 3DO and the Atari Jaguar, lead the team to brainstorm on different approaches that could be taken. The team came up with a system that used stereoscopic 3D images to display conventional 2D graphics, the Virtual Boy being the result of the hardware end, and &quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; and &quot;Mario Clash&quot; the end results of the software end. It was one of the four launch games that were released alongside the console and the console&#x27;s pack-in game in North America. Like all other Virtual Boy games, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect.&quot;

==Reception==
The game received generally mixed reviews from critics. A common complaint cited by reviewers was the fact that it was a tennis/sports game that lacked a multiplayer mode. &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the game a 26 out of 40. &quot;Next Generation&quot; awarded the game three out of five stars. A writer for the magazine commented, &quot;[I]f you&#x27;re looking for an addictive title to play on your Virtual Boy, this is one of the best choices you can make.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; remarked that &quot;&quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; commits a fault only with its simplistic music and effects&quot;, applauding the impressive 3D visuals, exceptionally large variety of moves for a tennis game, and challenging opponents. They later awarded it Best Virtual Boy Game of 1995.

In a retrospective review &quot;1UP.com&quot; praised the game&#x27;s 3D effects, but criticized the game&#x27;s lack of a multiplayer mode, or much to actually accomplish in the single player mode. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the game a 7 out of 10 stars, calling it a &quot;solid, if simple, tennis game&quot; that possessed &quot;Good music and graphics combined with...excellent 3D effect&quot;, though they too felt the game was held back by a lack of multiplayer mode, and a lack of characters, which led to the tournaments being too short. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Patrick Kolan compared the game to &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, another one of Nintendo&#x27;s pack-in games for one of its consoles, the Wii, in that it showed off the system&#x27;s unique strengths, but suffered in regards to non-impressive graphics and a lack of long-term game content. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; echoed these sentiments, stating &quot;Gameplay was rudimentary, and lacked all the flash and silliness that came to define the Mario Sports series, but as a 3D showpiece it worked fairly well&quot;. The &quot;Rome News-Tribune&quot; referred to &quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; as &quot;the only (...) decent stab at tennis&quot; prior to the release of Sega&#x27;s 2000 Dreamcast game &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot; started the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; series of video games, and has been credited as being the game that started up the sports-related sub-series of &quot;Mario&quot; video games in general.

<text>A talar or talaar () is a type of porch or hall in Iranian architecture. It generally refers to a porch fronting a building, supported by columns, and open on one or three sides. The term is also applied more widely to denote a throne hall or audience hall with some of these features.

== History ==
The columned hall or porch has its roots in ancient Persia, as seen in the Achaemenid palace in Persepolis, as well as in Greco-Roman houses and possibly even in the tents of Central Asian nomads who moved into Iran over the centuries. The &quot;talar&quot; can also refer to the representation of a throne carved on the rock-cut tomb of Darius at Naqsh-e Rostam, near Persepolis, and above the portico which was copied from his palace. 

The &quot;talar&quot; was revived in Iranian architecture under Abbas I () during the Safavid period. Safavid architects appropriated the idea of a columned hall from Achaemenid examples and used it in the design of new royal palaces and pavilions, most notably the Ali Qapu and Chehel Sotoun palaces in Isfahan during the 17th century. In these examples, the &quot;talar&quot; is open on three sides. 

Karim Khan Zand, the ruler of Shiraz in the mid-18th century, borrowed from Safavid models and employed this feature in new ways for the design of his own palaces in Shiraz. Here, the &quot;talar&quot; was combined with an iwan (vaulted hall open to one side) to form pillared halls opening onto a courtyard on one side. Under the Qajar dynasty, which eventually captured Shiraz and reunified Iran at the end of the 18th century, this feature was imported to the new royal palaces in Tehran. Under the Qajars, a &quot;talar&quot; could refer to a relatively simple hall open on one side with columns, such as the &quot;Talar e-Marmar&quot; (containing the &quot;Takht e-Marmar&quot;, the Marble Throne) built by Fath Ali Shah in the Golestan Palace in the 19th century. The &quot;talar&quot; continued to be a popular design feature of aristocratic houses and pavilions in Shiraz, such as those of the Qavam family. It was even employed during the early 20th century, under the Pahlavi dynasty, as part of the Persian revivalist trends in architecture during this time.

== Description ==
In ancient times, as depicted in the sculptured façade of Darius tomb at Persepolis show, the &quot;talar&quot; had three tiers, with Atlant statues upholding each. This design typified the subject-people of the monarch.

The &quot;talar&quot; built by the Qajar dynasty as part of the Golestan Palace is a spacious chamber with flat ceiling decorated with mirror panels. The walls are also decorated with mirror work called &quot;aineh-kari&quot;, which produced numerous angles and coruscations.

<text>Dundas light rail station is a light rail station and heritage-listed former suburban railway station serving the suburb of Dundas in Sydney, Australia. It was originally open between 1896 and 2020 on the Carlingford line, now forming part of the Parramatta Light Rail, served by L4 Westmead &amp; Carlingford Line services.

==History==
The station opened in 1896 as Kissing Point Road railway station. It was part of Bennett and Simpson&#x27;s Railway, a private railway that was aimed at serving property subdivisions to the north and provide better transport options for producers from the fruit growing districts around Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill and Dural. It also comprised Bennett&#x27;s private railway from Clyde to Rosehill constructed 1888, and the extension to Carlingford. This extension was constructed after investigations in 1891 and 1892 by the Minister for Works into the state of roads in the fruit growing district which saw the Simpson&#x27;s Railway Act passed on 13 June 1893. The Act authorised the private construction of a railway line in three sections from Bennett&#x27;s Railway line to Dural. Freight facilities were intended to be provided at the station to serve the nearby quarries.

The first section was to terminate at Carlingford, the second at Castle Hill (Rogans Hill) and the third at Dural. The Carlingford line was opened on 16 April 1896 but due to the increased costs and poor return from the freight and passenger service, it was decided not to proceed with the remaining sections. By the end of 1896, both Bennett&#x27;s and Simpson&#x27;s railways were in the hands of the Bank of New Zealand. The high cost of the Parramatta River bridge caused the financial collapse of the company and the station (along with the railway to Carlingford) was taken over in 1901 by the New South Wales Government Railways. The station was renamed Dundas at this time.

Dundas station was the last privately built and owned station building in New South Wales. It is also one of a very small number of platforms where access is at grade by crossing an operational railway line.

There was a severe fire in the station building in 2006, which destroyed the majority of the building&#x27;s original fabric. It was reconstructed to the same design in 2007.

The Camellia to Carlingford section of the Carlingford railway line was closed for conversion to light rail as part of the Parramatta Light Rail project on 5 January 2020. It was reopened as part of the light rail line on 20 December 2024.

==Services==
The station is served by light rail as follows: 

At the time the station closed to suburban services, it was served as follows:
==Transport links==
Busways operates one bus route via Dundas station:
*545: Parramatta station to Macquarie Park station via Eastwood

Dundas station is served by one NightRide route:
*N61: Carlingford station to City (Town Hall)

== Description ==
The station complex includes the reconstructed type 8 timber station building, metal passenger waiting area and concrete pedestrian crossing, all dating from 2007, and the original brick-faced platform, dating from 1896.
===Station building (2007)===
The station building is a reconstruction of the original timber narrow awning building (type 8). It is a painted timber building with a hip and gabled galvanised iron roof, and a skillion extension on the Carlingford (Up) end of the building. Four entry points, a large window and a small square window are located on the platform side and are covered with security screens. These are also used on all other windows and doors and hide the timber panelled doors and four paned timber framed windows. Some of the window frames appear to be original. The Station Street elevation is characterised by one double door entry, two large windows and several high, small square windows. The Station Street entry, together with the main entry area on the other side of the building have small, cantilevered awnings with corrugated iron sheeting and decorative ends.

===Passenger waiting area (2007)===
Immediately adjacent to the timber building on the Rydalmere (Down) end of the building is a modern passenger waiting area with a gabled, galvanised metal roof canopy with a post supported awning to the platform side and vertical timber board ends. Glass and steel form the remainder of the structure.

===Platform (1896)===
The platform is brick faced with pedestrian access at grade by crossing an operational railway line. Modern lighting, information signs and fencing is located in appropriate areas on the platform and around the station. A commuter carpark is located on the Station Street side of the station.

===Pedestrian Crossing (2007)===
The pedestrian crossing with concrete approaches over the single line track is located just off the Down end of the platform.

=== Modifications and dates ===
* Post-1950: Footbridge and goods siding removed
* 1959: Toilets built
* 1992: Platform canopy attached to building at the Sydney end;
* 2006: Severe fire destroyed the Station Master&#x27;s office and general waiting room
* 2007: The station building was largely reconstructed and repaired.
* date unknown: The skillion-roofed out-of shed attached to the Carlingford (Up) end
* 2010: Platform re-surfaced

== Heritage listing ==
Dundas railway station is significant for its small timber platform building which is the only known example of its type, characterised by close eaves with a small platform awning. The building however has lost its integrity having been reconstructed in 2007 after the original timber structure was destroyed by fire. The station is evidence of the construction of the private Bennett and Simpson Railway under the Simpsons&#x27; Railway Act in 1893, which provided transport to the northern suburbs, including Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill and Dural.

Dundas railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Dundas Railway Station has historic significance as the only former privately built station building on the railway network. It is evidence of the construction of the Bennett and Simpson Railway to the northern suburbs, which was abandoned following construction of Stage 1 due to financial difficulties.

The original atypical &quot;Type 8 – Narrow Awning Building&quot; was destroyed by fire and largely reconstructed in 2007. It is however, the only extant example of its type providing evidence of the &#x27;Type 8&#x27; style station building and is significant due to its construction as a good and true replica of the original building.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

The station has historical associations with the construction of a private railway under the Simpson&#x27;s&#x27; Railway Act in 1893, which provided transport to the northern suburbs such as Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill and Dural.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Despite being largely reconstructed, the timber station building is aesthetically significant as an example of small atypical &quot;Type 8&quot; buildings featuring a small platform awning and close eaves.

The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The place has the potential to contribute to the local community&#x27;s sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community&#x27;s past. Its historical associations with the local fruit producers of the time who agitated for the line is not considered as a special or strong association, and is no longer valid.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The timber building has the research potential for study into the type of building constructed on a private railway in Sydney in its reproduced form together with early plans.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Dundas station building, despite being a reconstruction, is the only known example of &quot;Type 8&quot; narrow awning railway station building. It provides evidence of such small timber atypical railway buildings. It has some rarity in this regard.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The building is representative of a railway station building type no longer extant on the railway network in NSW although it is unknown how many of the 23 planned buildings were built.

<doc id="1318436" wikidata="Q1970308" url="?curid=1318436" title="Chewton Mendip">
<text>Chewton Mendip is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England. It is situated north of Wells, south of Bath and Bristol on the A39 very close to the A37. The village is in a valley on the Mendip Hills, is the source of the River Chew and is therefore on the edge of the Chew Valley. The parish includes the hamlets of Bathway and Green Ore.

== History ==

There were several lead mines and stone quarries in the parish. It is also the site of Attborough Swallet (also known as Red Quar Swallet), a cave which is unusual for a cave on the Mendip Hills in that it is not in limestone but instead in Dolomitic Conglomerate and Marl. The cave was first entered in 1992.

There is a long barrow to the north of the village by . Excavation in 1946 revealed six Bronze Age barrows below the crest of the Mendips.
The shape of some of the existing fields suggests they are of medieval origin.

The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton.

On 12 June 1643 the village was the site of a skirmish in the English Civil War, between Royalist forces led by Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon and the parliamentary forces under William Waller including the cavalry unit of Sir Arthur Haselrig known as Haselrig&#x27;s lobsters.

The village used to have a Gothic style mansion built for the Waldegrave family before 1791, however all that remains is an 18th-century lodge.
The Waldegrave Estate still operates from an office in converted farm buildings in a small business park found on the southern edge of Chewton Mendip. Other companies include &#x27;Bathroom Engineering&#x27; (an international manufacturer &amp; distributor of bathroom &amp; shower products), and The Mendip Cheese Company (a cheese supplier).

The Mendip Engineering Company Ltd was based in Chewton Mendip around the time of World War I. It was founded in the early 19th century as Cutler&#x27;s Green Ironworks and supplied the British Army with swords. By the 19th century they were repairing farm machinery and casting drain covers and road signs. By the start of the 20th century the company was controlled by C.W. Harris and trading as the Mendip Engineering Company. C.W. Harris designed and built steam lorries in 1907/8 that were sold as Mendips; in 1911 petrol engine vans were added to the range. W.L. Adams was employed to design an engine and by 1913 had built a four-cylinder unit suitable for Cyclecars. In March 1914 Harris announced a Light Car completely made by the company; this was sold up to 1916 when war intervened. After World War I the company moved to Southmead Road in Bristol, and was later taken over by Baines Manufacturing Company Ltd of Westbury-on-Trym.
Although more than 300 cars were built, only one, incomplete, Mendip car survives, having been dug out of a hedge at Cookham near Marlow, Buckinghamshire in 1967.

In 2004 there was a proposal to build a wind turbine near Chewton Mendip but it was eventually turned down by Mendip District Council. There was particular concern about the effect the wind turbine would have on the Mendip Hills AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). That decision was appealed against and was considered at a public inquiry in 2006, at which Ecotricity was given the go-ahead to build the turbine.
The planned 2 MW turbine was built at Shooters Bottom Farm (). It has three blades rotating at 6–22 rpm around a high hub. It is expected to produce an average of 6.7MWh (megawatt hours) of electricity per year from the 2MW generator, enough to power up to 2,000 homes in the area.

== Governance ==

Chewton Mendip has its own Parish council which has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Nedge Ward which is represented by one councillor of Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

It is also part of the Mendip North West Division which is represented by one councillor on the Somerset County Council which is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

The village falls within the &#x27;Chewton Mendip and Ston Easton&#x27; electoral ward. The ward starts in Ston Easton, passes westwards to &quot;Chewton Mendip&quot; and then continues west to Charterhouse. The total ward population as at the 2011 census was 2,147.

It is also part of the Wells and Mendip Hills county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected six MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

== Geography ==

Chewton Mendip is within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Chew Valley.

The Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath follows the route taken by Charles II after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. The route enters Somerset near Chewton Mendip and crosses the Mendip Hills heading for Wells.

=== Climate ===
Along with the rest of South West England, Chewton Mendip has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2001 Census the Nedge Ward (which includes Litton) had 2,074 residents in 893 households, with an average age of 40.0 years. 78% of residents described their health as &#x27;good&#x27;, 18% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.8% of all economically active people aged 16–74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 it was ranked 26,803 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.

== Church ==
The church, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, is made of Lias Stone, with a tower of Doulting Stone which was &quot;unfinished&quot; in 1541. The tower contains a bell dating from 1753 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family. In addition, there is a peal of eight bells by Taylor&#x27;s of Loughborough. The church, which was started in 1441 by Carthusian monks, incorporates several Norman features including the north doorway. The register commences in the year 560. Near the altar is a stone seat, known as a &#x27;frid&#x27; for those, especially criminals, who took sanctuary in the church. The church includes monuments to Sir Henry Fitzroger and his wife who died in 1388, and to Frances, Lady Waldegrave (1879). The Waldegrave family have owned Chewton from 1553, but did not live in the village until the 1860s. It is a Grade II listed building. A stone cross in the churchyard also has listed building status.

Wade and Wade in their 1929 book &quot;&quot;Somerset&quot; described the church as a &quot;singularly interesting church, which possesses one of the most stately towers in the county&quot;&quot;.

Their description continued &quot;&quot;The arrangement of double belfry windows in the two upper stages is unusual, and the conventional lines of the elaborately pierced parapet above are relieved by the projecting stair turret and spirelet. The general effect is rich and impressive. The figure of our Lord, surrounded by four pairs of adoring angels, over the W. doorway should also be observed (cp. Batcombe). In the body of the church note should be taken of the good Norm. doorway forming the N. entrance. The interior is remarkable for an ugly bit of mediaeval vandalism. To render the altar observable from all parts of the church, a Norm. triplet, which once formed the chancel arch, has been mutilated; a pointed arch has been inserted, and the corner of the S. wall pared away. The chancel contains the only extant specimen in Somerset of a frid stool, a rough seat let into the sill of the N. window of the sacrarium for the accommodation of anyone claiming sanctuary. Note (1) piscinas of different dates in chancel; (2) change of design in arcading of nave, showing subsequent lengthening of church — the earlier columns stand on Norm. bases; (3) rood-loft doorway and ancient pulpit stairs near modern pulpit; (4) Jacobean lectern and Bible of 1611. The &quot;Bonville&quot; chantry, S. of chancel, contains a 15th-cent. altar-tomb with recumbent effigies of Sir H. Fitzroger and wife, and a modern mural tablet with medallion to Viscountess Waldegrave. In the churchyard is a weather-worn but fine cross, with a canopied crucifix. The Communion plate is pre-Reformation, dating from 1511.&quot;&quot;

<text>Tony Anselmo (born February 18, 1960) is an American voice actor and animator. He has been the official character voice of Donald Duck since 1985 following the death of the original voice actor, Clarence Nash. He has also provided voices for Donald&#x27;s triplet nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

Prior to voicing for Disney projects, he became an animator for the company in 1980. As of 2023, he has been credited in 23 animation roles.

==Early life==
Anselmo was born on February 18, 1960, in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Anselmo formed an early interest with Disney after attending a screening of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; at the age of four. Anselmo says, &quot;I remember leaving the theater and asking, &#x27;How did they do this? Who did that?&#x27; and so on...So a seed was planted there, and from that time on I never wanted to be a fireman, an astronaut, or anything else. I wanted to work for Disney.&quot;

Anselmo&#x27;s family moved to Sunnyvale in northern California when he was seven, and he continued to actively study Disney and animation. He began drawing, using the famed Preston Blair art book, &quot;Advanced Animation&quot;, built a light table of his own, and began creating animation with a Super 8 camera.

He attended Marian A. Peterson High School in Sunnyvale, California. He began night art classes at local colleges and began a regular correspondence with the artists who animated the Disney films, including Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Eric Larson, and Milt Kahl. Anselmo says, &quot;Ollie wrote a lot and sent me drawings, advising me to learn quick sketch, life drawing, and design.&quot;

Anselmo studied at the Character Animation Department of California Institute of the Arts on a full scholarship from the Disney Family in fall 1978.

==Career==

Anselmo&#x27;s career as an animator began in 1980, at age 20. In subsequent years, Anselmo contributed to the animation of 20 Disney animated features, including &quot;The Black Cauldron, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Tarzan&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;. Anselmo was trained and mentored by the original voice of Donald, Clarence Nash, who died in 1985 and Anselmo inherited the role of Donald Duck just as Nash had wished. He first voiced Donald on a 1986 D-TV Valentine special on The Disney Channel.

Walt Disney insisted on character consistency and integrity. As long as Clarence Nash was alive no one other than Nash was permitted to provide Donald&#x27;s voice. Continuing in that tradition, in 1988 Roy E. Disney created the department of Disney Character Voices to insure the continuation of character integrity, consistency, and quality in recording methods.

During an interview, Anselmo stated that &quot;Most people believe that Donald&#x27;s voice is done squeezing air through the cheek, that is not true. I can&#x27;t reveal how it&#x27;s actually done, but it is definitely not done by squeezing air through the cheek. The Hanna-Barbera character &#x27;Yakky Doodle&#x27; is done that way. Donald Duck is not.&quot;

Anselmo is the only person to both animate, and voice Donald Duck in &quot;Mickey Donald Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;Funny You Don&#x27;t Look 200&quot;, &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, and the &quot;60th Annual Academy Awards&quot;.

He has voiced the nephews on the TV special &quot;Down and Out With Donald Duck&quot; and the shows &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (while Russi Taylor (the voice of Minnie Mouse) voiced the nephews in DuckTales, Mickey&#x27;s Once and Twice Upon a Christmas, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Speedway USA&quot; and the video game in 2013.). He also lent his voice to minor characters in &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Around the World in 80 Days&quot; and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;.

Anselmo has also worked as a voice actor for the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, which features Donald Duck as one of three main characters. He also provided the voice of Donald in the video game &quot;Kinect Disneyland Adventures&quot; in 2011.

===Honors and acclaim===
Anselmo has been honored with several awards and nominations. He was a winner of the 2014 BTVA Television Voice Acting Award for Best Vocal Ensemble in a Television Series — Children&#x27;s/Educational for &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;, as well as the BTVA Video Game Voice Acting Award for Best Vocal Ensemble in a Video Game - &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;.

In September 2009, Tony Anselmo was named a Disney Legend by Roy E. Disney.

Anselmo began collecting Disney merchandise at an early age, and is known for his comprehensive collection of Disney posters relating to the works of Walt Disney. This expertise resulted in a 2002 art book, &quot;The Disney Poster Book featuring the Collection of Tony Anselmo&quot;. Anselmo&#x27;s collection was used in exhibits at The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco.

<text>Triss is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 2002. It is the 15th book in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
At Riftgard, an isle in the far north, the ferret king, King Agarnu, and his cruel offspring, Princess Kurda and Prince Bladd hold sway over a Ratguard army and enslaved creatures. One of the slaves, Trisscar Swordmaid escapes with her friends Shogg and Welfo, southward to Mossflower. In the attempt, her friend Drufo is killed. Meanwhile, Kurda hires a pirate ship, the &quot;Seascab&quot;, captained by Plugg Firetail, to take her to Mossflower, where she must find the royal artefacts of Riftgard to seal her queenship.

In Redwall Abbey, rebellious Dibbuns Ruggum and Bikkle run away into Mossflower Woods. They discover Brockhall, the ancestral home of badgers, but are chased away by serpents. Fortunately, they are rescued by the Skipper of Otters and Log-a-Log Groo, and they bring with them a golden paw-ring with strange markings.
Sagaxus, heir to Salamandastron, and his friend Bescarum Lepuswold Whippscut (who go by Sagax and Scarum respectively), leave the mountain for adventure with Kroova Wavedog, in his ketch the &quot;Stopdog&quot;. Scarum&#x27;s father, Colonel Whippscut of the Long Patrol, searches for them in the name of Lord Hightor, the Badger Lord. Sagax finds a bow on the ketch (the property of its previous owners) with similar markings to the pawring. They disregard it and decide to journey to Redwall, and on their way, they wind up in possession of a dagger with the same pattern.

Triss and her friends, in their ship, see the same markings. Triss is able to interpret them as an R, H, O, and R, standing for &quot;Royal House of Riftgard&quot;. On the journey, they become dehydrated, but are rescued by the hedgehogs of Peace Island. Welfo remains with her newfound love, Urtica, while Triss and Shogg continue south. They cross paths with Kurda on the &quot;Seascab&quot; in the middle of a lightning storm, but the contraband vessel escapes.

Meanwhile, the Redwall denizens try to explore Brockhall, but it is inhabited by three serpents, one of which wears a crown with the Riftgard pattern. The adders, Zassaliss, Harssacss, and Sesstra, are the children of Berussca, an adder slain by and who in turn slew King Sarengo, Agarnu&#x27;s father; they remain bound by Sarengo&#x27;s mace and chain. Ovus, a tawny owl, brings Bluddbeak, an ancient red kite from afar to defeat the adders, but in their attempt, both birds die. Mokug, a golden hamster who had been Sarengo&#x27;s slave, is rescued and brings with him a message in Riftgard script. Martin the Warrior visits Skipper&#x27;s niece, Churk, in her dreams, giving the Redwallers the hint they need to decode the message, but it is a riddle that&#x27;s difficult to interpret.

Elsewhere, Sagax, Scarum, and Kroova are captured by the crew of the &quot;Seascab&quot;, and the &quot;Stopdog&quot; is destroyed. Triss and Shogg meet up with them, and together they are able to escape. Kroova and Shogg set up a hidden stake that injures Plugg, and his tail falls off, though he reattaches it with pine resin.

Kurda and her vermin then cross paths with the Redwallers, who fend them off, while Triss, Shogg, Sagax, Scarum, and Kroova enter the safety of the abbey. Triss sees the Sword of Martin and is immediately drawn to it, wielding it as the Redwallers continue to battle the Ratguard army. Bladd is killed by a falling pot of oatmeal, and Plugg is killed by the snakes, while Kurda concentrates her efforts on destroying the denizens of Redwall.

Eventually, Skipper&#x27;s niece helps solve the riddle, which leads the Redwallers to Brockhall. There they encounter both the Ratguards and the snakes. During the ensuing battle, Shogg, Sagax, and Triss kill Sesstra, Harssacss, and Zassaliss, but Shogg is poisoned and dies by Triss&#x27;s side. Later, Triss and Kurda face off, but Kurda falls on her own sword and dies.

Triss, Kroova, Sagax, Scarum, Groo, Skipper, Mokug, and others sail to Riftgard and free the slaves. There, King Agarnu is drowned by the slaves. Kroova stays on Riftgard with the sea otter Sleeve, and the others return to Redwall Abbey.

<text>Michael Legge (born June 12, 1953) is a Massachusetts-born American B-movie filmmaker and actor. He is known for producing low-budget comedy-horror films that he writes, directs and generally stars in. He founded the production company Sideshow Cinema.

== Early life ==
According to Legge, he enjoyed watching the comedies of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy and was also a big fan of horror movies that were so prevalent in the 1950s/1960s. He started making movies at a young age with an 8mm movie camera and by high school was making spoofs of movies such as David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. Legge was writing and acting in these films, as well as shooting and editing them, with help from friends and family members.

== Acting career ==
Legge has won several awards as an actor, including a B-Movie Award at the B-Movie Film Festival for being the Best Villain in 1999 in his film &quot;Braindrainer&quot;. He has acted on the stage as well as on screen. In 2000, he played Dr. Wahl in &quot;The Girls from H.A.R.M.!&quot;, a film directed by Pat Bishow.

== Filmmaking career ==
Michael Legge&#x27;s filmmaking career developed out of his love of the movies and of his own skill at making short comedies and off-the-wall films. His early movies were all shot on film. From 1970 to 1986 he made dozens of films. He continued to produce and develop films through his production company Sideshow Cinema. With his success on the festival circuit, an independent film distributor signed him up and released many of his short and feature films on video. Currently, Sub Rosa is releasing all his films.

&quot;Honey Glaze&quot; (2003) was Legge&#x27;s biggest-budget film ever, and it had a successful Sub Rosa release. His comedy film &quot;Democrazy&quot;, released January 25, 2005, stars himself, Lorna Nogueira, John Shanahan, and Stacy Armstrong.

<doc id="1318477" wikidata="Q2578239" url="?curid=1318477" title="William Cargill (New Zealand politician)">
<text>William Walter Cargill (27 August 1784 – 6 August 1860) was the founder of the Otago settlement in New Zealand, after serving as an officer in the British Army. He was a member of parliament and Otago&#x27;s first Superintendent.

==Early life==

Cargill was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1784. His parents were James Cargill and Marrion Jamieson. His father died of alcoholism when William was 15. He joined the British Army in 1802 and served with distinction in India, Spain, and France. In 1813, he married Mary Ann Yates and they went on to have seventeen children. Of these, two of his five sons became notable in public life: John, who followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a politician, and Edward, a prominent businessman and politician. Family circumstances forced him to sell his commission in 1820, though he was later referred to as &quot;Captain Cargill&quot;. After leaving the army, he became a wine merchant in Scotland.

On 24 November 1847, Cargill sailed for New Zealand on the ship &quot;John Wickliffe&quot;, arriving at what is now Port Chalmers, Otago on 23 March 1848.

==Political career==

The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 granted the settler population self-government, and in 1853 Cargill was elected Superintendent of the Otago Province. Cargill also served as a Member of Parliament for Dunedin Country. He was elected unopposed on 11 December 1855. He served the multi-member electorate alongside his son John. He rarely spoke in the house and found travel to parliament in Auckland difficult. Aged 75, he announced his resignation from public office in October 1859; he died less than a year later. He was described as a &quot;unabashed provincialist&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Cargill died of a stroke on 6 August 1860, at his home &quot;Hillside&quot; in Dunedin, and is buried in Dunedin Southern Cemetery with his wife and three children.

His granddaughter Isabel Cargill travelled to Italy with Ann Marie Babington and in 1893 they opened Babington&#x27;s tea room on the Spanish Steps in Rome which still today belongs to her descendants. 

Numerous names have connections with Cargill. The city of Invercargill is named in honour of him (&quot;Inver&quot; coming from the Scots Gaelic word &quot;inbhir&quot; meaning &quot;a river&#x27;s mouth&quot;), as is Mount Cargill, which towers above northern Dunedin. &quot;Cargill&#x27;s Corner&quot; is a major road intersection in South Dunedin, and one of the roads which crosses at it is Hillside Road, named for Cargill&#x27;s house. A Tasmanian sandstone monument to Cargill, simply known as the Cargill Monument, was built in Dunedin in 1863–64.

Cargill&#x27;s Castle, a ruined stately home above St Clair is not named for William Cargill, but for his son Edward.

<text>Mary Walcott (July 5, 1675 – 1752) was one of the &quot;afflicted&quot; girls called as a witness at the Salem witch trials in early 1692-93.

==Life==
Born July 5, 1675, she was the daughter of Captain Jonathan Walcott (1639–1699), and his wife, Mary Sibley (or Sibly; 1644–1683), both of Salem, and was about seventeen years old when the allegations started in 1692. Her aunt, Mary (née Wolcott), the wife of Samuel Sibley (or Sibly; 1657–1708), was the person who first showed Tituba and Tituba&#x27;s husband John Indian how to bake a &quot;witch cake&quot; to feed to a dog in order that she and her friends might ascertain exactly who it was that was afflicting them. Joseph B. Felt quoted in &quot;The Annals of Salem&quot; (1849 edition) vol. 2, p. 476 [from the town records]:

March 11, 1692 – &quot;Mary, the wife of Samuel Sibley, having been suspended from communion with the church there, for the advices she gave John [husband of Tituba] to make the above experiment, is restored on confession that her purpose was innocent.&quot;

==Marriage==
Mary Walcott married Isaac Farrar, son of John Farrar of Woburn, Massachusetts, on April 28, 1696. They had several children, and eventually moved to Townsend, Massachusetts. She married, secondly, to David Harwood in 1701 in Sutton, Massachusetts. They had nine children:

# Mary Harwood, b. Abt. 1702.; d. Abt. 1753. 
# Emma Harwood, b. Abt. 1705. (m. Ebenezer Macintyre, May 23, 1728). 
# Hannah Harwood, b. Abt. 1706; (m. Ebenezer Twiss, Abt. 1752). 
# David Harwood, b. Abt. 1708, Salem, Essex County, Massachusetts; d. August 22, 1781, Sutton, Worcester County, Massachusetts; (m. Margaret Cox, March 13, 1730/31, Salem, Essex Cnty, Massachusetts). 
# Elizabeth Harwood, b. Abt. 1711; d. Abt. 1738; (m. Benjamin Moulton, October 1734). 
# Ezra Harwood, b. Abt. 1715. 
# Alice Harwood, b. Abt. 1720, Salem, Massachusetts (m. Jonathan Nourse Jr., August 12, 1743). 
# Absalom Harwood, b. Abt. 1723; (m. Anna Boyce, September 23, 1748). 
# Solomon Harwood, b. Abt. 1725; (m. Abagail Phelps, December 20, 1748; m. Sarah Taylor December 4, 1752).

==Later years==
They moved to Sutton about 1729, leaving most of their children living in Salem. David was a weaver by occupation. David died before 1744. Mary Walcott Harwood probably died before 1752.

<doc id="1318483" wikidata="Q2467381" url="?curid=1318483" title="Michał Serwacy Wiśniowiecki">
<text>Prince Michał Serwacy Wiśniowiecki (; 13 May 1680 – 18 September 1744) was a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, magnate, politician, diplomat, general, a successful military commander and the last male representative of the Wiśniowiecki family.

He was the Lithuanian Field Hetman in 1703 and between 1707–1735, Castellan of Vilnius from 1703, Great Hetman of Lithuania in 1703-1707 and again in 1735. Regimentarz of the Lithuanian army since 1730, Voivode of Vilnius between 1706-1707 and 1735 and marshal of the Lithuanian Tribunal. Great Chancellor of Lithuania from 1720, Marshal of the Sejm from 11 June to 19 August 1703 in Lublin and Governor of Pinsk, Vawkavysk, Hlyniany, Tuchola, Wilkisk, Wilkowsk, Metel and Merkinė.

During the Lithuanian Civil War (1697–1702), Wiśniowiecki led the opposition against the Sapieha and defeated them in the battle of Valkininkai, burning their Ruzhany Palace to ashes. Supporter of Augustus II the Strong till 1707, when he switched to Stanisław Leszczyński&#x27;s side. In the same year imprisoned by the Russians, since 1709 was exiled. In 1716, when he accepted Augustus II the Strong&#x27;s rule, he returned to the country. In 1733, he supported the Russian intervention and forced election of Augustus III.

Wiśniowiecki was one of the wealthiest magnates in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and his burial ceremony in Wiśniowiec is considered as the most lavish of the 18th century in Poland.

==Early life and family==
Because Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s biological father died young, he and his older brother were raised by their stepfather, Jan Karol Dolski. Michał studied at the Jesuit college in Lviv, where he graduated in 1695. At the same time, his stepfather died and Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s mother, desiring to keep the property and the wealth of her deceased husband, quickly arranged marriage of his daughter Catherine with Michał, although he was just 15 years old. The wedding took place without any publicity, in order to silence the protests of Catherine&#x27;s family, who would confiscate her rightful estates and the money. Shortly after the wedding he left his wife in Poland and went on a trip abroad, during which he spent a year in the military academy in Paris. From abroad he returned in 1697 to take part in the new election of a king, during which he supported the candidacy of the Wettin family member and Elector of Saxony, Augustus II the Strong. At the same time, a conflict erupted between Michał and his mother about the former wealth of his stepfather. In this case the possession conflict also concerned his wife. Eventually, Michał and his brother inherited the fortune that Dolski left, however, this greatly and negatively influenced the relationship with his mother.

==Political and military career==

=== Lithuanian Civil War in 1700 ===
Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s proper political career began on the eve of the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700, when he was the leader of the opposition against Sapieha family clan and defeated them in the battle of Valkininkai, turning their Ruzhany Palace to ashes.

=== Great Northern War (1700-1721) ===

==== Civil war in Poland (1704–1706) ====
After becoming Speaker of the Parliament in Lublin, in 1703, the noble Diet appointed him Lithuanian Field Hetman, Castellan of Vilnius and eventually he gained the title of the Great Hetman of Lithuania. Throughout the civil war period in the early eighteenth century, Wiśniowiecki supported Augustus II, but only few months after Augustus&#x27; abdication in 1707, he switched sides only to favour the new king Stanisław I Leszczyński.

Moreover, Michał was forced to give back the title of a Hetman and the province of Vilnius. After the defeat of the Swedish army at the Battle of Poltava that Wiśniowiecki aided and supported, he was forced (from the Russian side) to give up his family and possessions. After his refusal on 8 September 1709 he was immediately imprisoned by the Russian Imperial Army. Despite the intercession of many people, including king Augustus II himself, who then returned to Poland, Tsar Peter I was not going to release the prince, whom he considered a traitor and a liar. Only after a year Michał managed to escape, but for a long time he was unable to return to the country where the Russian troops remained and stationed, especially in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After several years of trying to restore the Leszczyński family on the Polish throne, and after heavy negotiations with Augustus, in spring of 1716 Wiśniowiecki returned to Poland, but the prince could not count on retaining his former titles and posts as these were already occupied by strong supporters and loyal friends of the king. It was only in 1720 that the post of Chancellor of Lithuania became vacant and after some hesitation, the king allowed Michał to become the Chancellor. Also during this time he was awarded the Order of the White Eagle.

=== Commander of the Lithuanian military ===
After the death of the Great Lithuanian Hetman Ludwik Pociej (1730), Prince Michał renewed his efforts to recover the title of a Hetman. But the king refused to trust him and Wiśniowiecki only received the position of commander-General (&quot;Regimentarz&quot;) in practice, however - in the absence of the Hetman - the monarch granted him full authority and command over the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army.

=== War of the Polish Succession (1734-1738) ===
After the death of Tsar Peter I, Wiśniowiecki improved his relations with Russia and, therefore, in the course of the 1733 election he supported the election of Augustus III. As one of the few magnates he took part in the king&#x27;s coronation in Wawel Cathedral of Kraków and, ironically, later fought against the supporters of Stanisław Leszczyński, although he himself preferred not to be involved in this conflict. In return for his services to the new king, in 1735 Michał fully regained the title of Hetman. He also received numerous counties, towns, villages and towards the end of his life Wiśniowiecki has become one of the strongest magnates in the Grand Duchy and the Eastern parts of the Commonwealth.

== Death and Funeral ==
He died on 16 September 1744 in the town of Merkinė. His third wife, Tekla Róża Radziwiłł organized an extravagant and lavish funeral that lasted nearly three days. During the ceremony, the guards presented the mourners and the audience with 12 portraits of his ancestors and a ceremonial breaking of the shield was conducted as a sign of extinction of the noble family.

<text>The 1936 United States Senate elections coincided with the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The 32 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. The Great Depression continued and voters backed progressive candidates favoring Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal in races across the country. The Democrats gained 5 net seats during the election, and in combination with Democratic and Farmer–Labor interim appointments and the defection of George W. Norris from the Republican Party to become independent, the Republicans were reduced to 16 seats. Democrats gained a further two seats due to mid-term vacancies. The Democrats&#x27; 77 seats and their 62-seat majority remain their largest in history.

This was the last of four consecutive election cycles where Republicans suffered losses due to the ongoing effects of the Great Depression. This was also the last Senate election cycle until 2012 in which a Democratic candidate who won two terms also made net gains in the Senate on both occasions (although Roosevelt won a third term and fourth term, he lost Senate seats on both occasions). Additionally, this is the last time any party held three-fourths of all Senate seats.

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
One Republican, one Farmer-Labor, and five Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election.

===Defeats===
Six Republicans and one Democrat sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election.

===Death===
One Democrat died on July 16, 1936, and his seat remained vacant until the election.

===Independent gain===
One Republican won re-election as an Independent.

===Post-election changes===

== Change in composition ==

=== Before the elections ===
After the April 1936 special election.
=== Result of the elections ===
=== Beginning of the next Congress ===



== Race summaries ==
=== Elections during the 74th Congress ===
In these special elections the winners were seated once they qualified; ordered by election date.

=== Elections leading to the 75th Congress ===
In these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 1937; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 2 seats.

== Closest races ==
Eleven races had a margin of victory under 10%:

There is no tipping point state.

== Alabama ==





== Arkansas ==




== Colorado ==





== Delaware ==




== Florida (special) ==

There were two special elections in Florida, due to the May 8, 1936, death of four-term Democrat Park Trammell and the June 17, 1936, death of five-term Democrat Duncan U. Fletcher.

=== Florida (special, class 1) ===
Democrat Scott M. Loftin was appointed May 26, 1936, to continue the term, pending a special election. Primaries were held August 11, 1936.




Andrews would be re-elected once and serve until his death September 18, 1946.

=== Florida (special, class 3) ===

Democrat William Luther Hill was appointed July 1, 1936, to continue the term, pending a special election. Democrat Claude Pepper, who had lost to Trammell in 1934, won this election.



Pepper would be re-elected twice and serve until he lost renomination in 1950. He would later be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and serve there for 26 years.

== Idaho ==





== Illinois ==







== Iowa ==

=== Louisiana (regular) ===




=== Louisiana (special) ===

Democrat Rose McConnell Long was elected April 21, 1936, to finish the term to which she was appointed on January 31, 1936. She was not a candidate, however, to the next term on November 3, 1936, see above.


== Maine ==





== Massachusetts ==






== Michigan ==







== Minnesota ==
There were 2 elections to the same seat on the same day due to the December 22, 1935, death of two-term Republican Thomas D. Schall.

=== Minnesota (special) ===

The election was held to fill the vacancy in the seat formerly held by Thomas D. Schall for the final two months of Schall&#x27;s unexpired term. Governor Floyd B. Olson had appointed Elmer Benson to fill the seat in 1935, but this appointment was temporary and subject to a special election held in the next general election year thereafter—1936. Benson opted to run for governor instead of running for election to continue for the remainder of the term. No special primaries were held for the special election, and, among Minnesota&#x27;s three major parties, only the Republican Party of Minnesota officially fielded a candidate—Guy V. Howard. Regardless of the absence of Farmer-Labor and Democratic nominees, Howard nevertheless faced a great degree of competition from independent candidates Nathaniel J. Holmberg, Andrew Olaf Devold, and John G. Alexander.

The candidates were:
* John G. Alexander (I), Attorney and real estate manager
* Andrew Olaf Devold (I), Attorney, State Senator since 1919, former State Representative (1915–1919); a member of the Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota and formerly a member of the Socialist Party of Minnesota
* N. J. Holmberg (I), Former State Senator (1915–1919) and State Representative (1907–1915); a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota
* Guy V. Howard (R), Businessman and Republican elector in the 1916 presidential election



Howard was not a candidate for the next term, and served only until January 1937.

=== Minnesota (regular) ===

The election to the next term was won by Farmer–Labor congressman Ernest Lundeen.



== Mississippi ==




== Montana ==




== Nebraska ==




== New Hampshire ==




== New Jersey ==






== New Mexico ==

There were 2 elections, due to the May 6, 1935, death of two-term Republican Bronson M. Cutting.

=== New Mexico (special) ===
Democratic former-Congressman Dennis Chavez had been Cutting&#x27;s opponent in 1934. On May 11, 1935, after Cutting&#x27;s death, Chavez was then appointed to continue Cutting&#x27;s term, pending a special election which he then won.



Chavez would be re-elected four more times and serve until his death in 1962.

=== New Mexico (regular) ===
First-term Democrat Carl Hatch was easily re-elected.



Hatch would be re-elected once and serve until his 1948 retirement.

<text>The Indiana State Fair is an annual state fair that spans 15 days in August in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. The Indiana State Fair debuted in 1852 at Military Park in Indianapolis and is the sixth oldest state fair in the U.S. It is the largest event in the state, drawing between 730,000 and 980,000 visitors annually since 2010. In 2015, readers of &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked the Indiana State Fair among the ten best state fairs in the country.

The Indiana State Fairgrounds &amp; Event Center has been the host site of the fair since 1892. Located about north of downtown Indianapolis, it encompasses , 72 buildings, a 6,000-seat grandstand, and a racetrack. The complex is home to year-round tenants and is used throughout the year for a variety of other gatherings, including trade shows, sporting events, and concerts.

==History==
===19th century===

In February 1851, at the urging of Governor Joseph Wright, the Indiana General Assembly passed an act intended &quot;to encourage agriculture&quot; growth in the state, which also included the formation of a State Board of Agriculture. A primary goal of the board was to organize an Indiana State Fair. Indiana was the sixth state to begin holding an annual statewide agricultural fair. On October 20–22, 1852, Indiana&#x27;s first state fair was held on the grounds of what is now Military Park, west of downtown Indianapolis. In 1860 a new location for the fairgrounds was established on approximately along Alabama Street, north of the city.

During the American Civil War, the county fairgrounds was converted into Camp Morton, a prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers. In 1864, a sanitary fair was held as part of the larger state fair. In 1865, the fair was held in Fort Wayne. The gates opened at the Indiana State Fairgrounds on East 38th Street for the first time on September 19, 1892. Since then, the fair has continually been held in Indianapolis.

The Indiana State Fair has been held in Indianapolis for the majority of its existence. Other Indiana cities hosted the event during the 19th century, including Lafayette (1853); Madison (1854); New Albany (1859); Fort Wayne (1865); and Terre Haute (1867).

===20th century===
There was no fair held in 1917 and 1918 because of World War I nor from 1942 to 1944 because of World War II.

On October 31, 1963, a propane tank exploded in the Indiana State Fair Coliseum, killing 54 at the scene; another 27 died due to their injuries, with a total of 81 people killed. Around another 400 were injured. It is the deadliest disaster in Indianapolis history.

===21st century===

Historically, the fair lasted 12 days; however, it was expanded to 17 days (2009–2019), and then to 18 days (2021-2023). Starting in 2024, the event has been condensed down to 15 days.

On August 13, 2011, high winds from an approaching thunderstorm collapsed the roof over the grandstand stage just before Sugarland was about to perform, killing seven people and injuring 58. Concerts were moved indoors to the Fairgrounds Coliseum, and, during that building&#x27;s renovation in 2013, events were moved to Bankers Life Fieldhouse and Lucas Oil Stadium. The coliseum reopened in 2014.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of the 2020 fair. The fair resumed in 2021 with some social distancing measures, but masks were not required.

==Competitions==

During each annual run of the Indiana State Fair, several competitions take place. The 4-H has a large participation in the fair and competitions are held in numerous areas for 4-H youth members. 4-H winners at county fairs can progress to the state fair with their livestock, crafts, gardening, or other exhibits. The winner at the state fair can, in some cases, advance to a national competition. The winners receive scholarships and other awards.

Other competitions also occur including art contests, a hot air balloon race, and a high school marching band contest, the Indiana State Fair Band Day on &quot;Band Day&quot;. Adult competitions also occur in various farm-related categories.

The Indiana State Fairgrounds&#x27; mile-long oval track has hosted auto races for over a century. The AAA National Championship and USAC National Championship hosted car races in 1946 and from 1953 to 1970, traditionally under the name Hoosier Hundred. The USAC Silver Crown Series sanctioned the event since 1971. However, the track will be converted to a harness racing facility with an all-weather surface of crushed limestone. The half-mile dirt track in the infield will also be eliminated to allow more parking for the State Fair and other events. The conversion was originally scheduled to occur after the 2019 race, but the conversion was delayed until 2021; the 2021 race was originally scheduled to still be run at the Fairgrounds, but was moved to the Terre Haute Action Track.

==Entertainment==
===Midway===

The Midway is the area of amusement park rides and games. Fairgoers can either buy single-ride tickets or unlimited ride wristbands. Midway rides operate from noon until 10 or 11 pm depending on the day.

===Performances===
Numerous nationally known entertainers have performed at the Indiana State Fair.

On September 3, 1964, The Beatles performed two sold-out shows to a total audience of nearly 30,000 and, in 1989, New Kids on the Block set a Grandstand attendance record with 18,509 audience members.

The fair also presents Latino/Hispanic entertainment for Indiana&#x27;s Hispanic population.

==Presidential visits==
In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson gave a speech to a crowd of 40,000 on a day known as &quot;Big Thursday.&quot; Over the years, Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, John F. Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have all made appearances at the fairgrounds.

<doc id="1318497" wikidata="Q56139" url="?curid=1318497" title="Liquor">
<text>Liquor ( , sometimes hard liquor), spirits, distilled spirits, or spiritous liquor are alcoholic drinks produced by the distillation of grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. While the word &quot;liquor&quot; ordinarily refers to distilled alcoholic spirits rather than drinks produced by fermentation alone, it can sometimes be used more broadly to refer to any alcoholic beverage (or even non-alcoholic ones produced by distillation or some other practices, such as the brewed liquor of a tea).

The distillation process concentrates the alcohol, the resulting condensate has an increased alcohol by volume. As liquors contain significantly more alcohol (ethanol) than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered &quot;harder&quot;. In North America, the term &quot;hard liquor&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term &quot;spirits&quot; is more commonly used in the United Kingdom. Some examples of liquors include vodka, rum, gin and tequila. Liquors are often aged in barrels, such as for the production of brandy and whiskey, or are infused with flavorings to form flavored liquors, such as absinthe.

Like other alcoholic drinks, liquor is typically consumed for the psychoactive effects of alcohol. Liquor may be consumed on its own (i.e. &quot;neat&quot;), typically in amounts of around per served drink; or frequently mixed with other ingredients to form a cocktail. In an undiluted form, distilled beverages are often slightly sweet and bitter and typically impart a burning mouthfeel with an odor derived from the alcohol and the production and aging processes; the exact flavor varies between different varieties of liquor and the different impurities they impart.

Rapid consumption of a large amount of liquor can cause severe alcohol intoxication or alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal either due to acute biochemical damage to vital organs (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis), or due to trauma (e.g. falls or motor vehicle accidents) caused by alcohol-induced delirium. Consistent consumption of liquor over time correlates with higher mortality and other harmful health effects, even when compared to other alcoholic beverages.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;spirit&quot; (singular and used without the additional term &quot;drink&quot;) refers to liquor that should not contain added sugar and is usually 35–40% alcohol by volume (ABV). Fruit brandy, for example, is also known as &#x27;fruit spirit&#x27;.

Liquor bottled with added sugar and flavorings, such as Grand Marnier, amaretto, and American schnapps, are known instead as liqueurs.

Liquor generally has an alcohol concentration higher than 30% when bottled, and before being diluted for bottling, it typically has a concentration over 50%. Beer and wine, which are not distilled, typically have a maximum alcohol content of about 15% ABV, as most yeasts cannot metabolize when the concentration of alcohol is above this level; as a consequence, fermentation ceases at that point.

==Etymology==
The origin of &quot;liquor&quot; and its close relative &quot;liquid&quot; is the Latin verb &quot;liquere&quot;, meaning &#x27;to be fluid&#x27;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;), an early use of the word in the English language, meaning simply &quot;a liquid&quot;, can be dated to 1225. The first use documented in the &quot;OED&quot; defined as &quot;a liquid for drinking&quot; occurred in the 14th century. Its use as a term for &quot;an intoxicating alcoholic drink&quot; appeared in the 16th century.

== Legal definition ==
=== European Union ===
In accordance with the regulation (EU) 2019/787 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 17, 2019, a &quot;spirit drink&quot; is an alcoholic beverage that has been produced:

* either directly by using, individually or in combination, any of the following methods:
*# distillation, with or without added flavourings or flavouring foodstuffs, of fermented products;
*# maceration or similar processing of plant materials in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, distillates of agricultural origin or spirit drinks or a combination thereof;
*# addition, individually or in combination, to ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, distillates of agricultural origin, or spirit drinks of flavourings, colours, other authorised ingredients, sweetening products, other agricultural products, and foodstuffs.
* or by adding, individually or in combination, to it any of the following:
*# other spirit drinks;
*# ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin;
*# distillates of agricultural origin;
*# other foodstuffs.

Spirit drinks must contain at least 15% ABV (except in the case of egg liqueur such as Advocaat, which must contain a minimum of 14% ABV).

==== Distillate of agricultural origin ====
Regulation makes a difference between &quot;ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin&quot; and a &quot;distillate of agricultural origin&quot;. &quot;Distillate of agricultural origin&quot; is defined as an alcoholic liquid that is the result of the distillation, after alcoholic fermentation, of agricultural products which does not have the properties of ethyl alcohol and which retain the aroma and taste of the raw materials used.

==== Categories ====

Annex 1 to the regulation lists 44 categories of spirit drinks and their legal requirements.

Some spirit drinks can fall into more than one category. Specific production requirements distinguish one category from another (London gin falls into the Gin category but any gin cannot be considered as London gin).

Spirit drinks that are not produced within the EU, such as tequila or baijiu, are not listed in the 44 categories.

==History of distillation==
===Early history===
Early evidence of distillation comes from Akkadian tablets dated describing perfumery operations, providing textual evidence that an early, primitive form of distillation was known to the Babylonians of ancient Mesopotamia. Early evidence of distillation also comes from alchemists working in Alexandria, Roman Egypt, in the 1st century. Distilled water was described in the 2nd century AD by Alexander of Aphrodisias. Alchemists in Roman Egypt were using a distillation alembic or still device in the 3rd century.

Distillation was known in the ancient Indian subcontinent, evident from baked clay retorts and receivers found at Taxila and Charsadda in Pakistan and Rang Mahal in India dating to the early centuries of the Common Era. Frank Raymond Allchin says these terracotta distill tubes were &quot;made to imitate bamboo&quot;. These &quot;Gandhara stills&quot; were capable of producing only very weak liquor, as there was no efficient means of collecting the vapors at low heat.

Distillation in China could have begun during the Eastern Han dynasty (1st–2nd centuries), but the distillation of beverages began in the Jin (12th–13th centuries) and Southern Song (10th–13th centuries) dynasties according to archaeological evidence.

Freeze distillation involves freezing the alcoholic beverage and then removing the ice. The freezing technique had limitations in geography and implementation limiting how widely this method was put to use.

=== Distillation of wine ===
The flammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient natural philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE), Theophrastus (), and Pliny the Elder (23/24–79 CE). This did not immediately lead to the isolation of alcohol, however, despite the development of more advanced distillation techniques in second- and third-century Roman Egypt. An important recognition, first found in one of the writings attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (ninth century CE), was that by adding salt to boiling wine, which increases the wine&#x27;s relative volatility, the flammability of the resulting vapors may be enhanced. The distillation of wine is attested in Arabic works attributed to al-Kindī (c. 801–873 CE) and to al-Fārābī (c. 872–950), and in the 28th book of al-Zahrāwī&#x27;s (Latin: Abulcasis, 936–1013) &quot;Kitāb al-Taṣrīf&quot; (later translated into Latin as &quot;Liber servatoris&quot;). In the twelfth century, recipes for the production of &quot;aqua ardens&quot; (&quot;burning water&quot;, i.e., alcohol) by distilling wine with salt started to appear in a number of Latin works, and by the end of the thirteenth century, it had become a widely known substance among Western European chemists. Its medicinal properties were studied by Arnald of Villanova (1240–1311 CE) and John of Rupescissa (c. 1310–1366), the latter of whom regarded it as a life-preserving substance able to prevent all diseases (the &quot;aqua vitae&quot; or &quot;water of life&quot;, also called by John the &quot;quintessence&quot; of wine).

In China, archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the 12th century Jin or Southern Song dynasties.
A still has been found at an archaeological site in Qinglong, Hebei, dating to the 12th century.

In India, the true distillation of alcohol was introduced from the Middle East and was in wide use in the Delhi Sultanate by the 14th century.

The works of Taddeo Alderotti (1223–1296) describe a method for concentrating alcohol involving repeated fractional distillation through a water-cooled still, by which an alcohol purity of 90% could be obtained.

In 1437, &quot;burned water&quot; (brandy) was mentioned in the records of the County of Katzenelnbogen in Germany.

===Government regulation===
====Production====
It is legal to distill beverage alcohol as a hobby for personal use in some countries, including New Zealand and the Netherlands.

In many others including the United States, it is illegal to distill beverage alcohol without a license, and the licensing process is too arduous for hobbyist-scale production. In some parts of the U.S., it is also illegal to sell a still without a license. Nonetheless, all states allow unlicensed individuals to make their own beer, and some also allow unlicensed individuals to make their own wine (although making beer and wine is also prohibited in some local jurisdictions).

====Sale====
Some countries and sub-national jurisdictions limit or prohibit the sale of certain high-percentage alcohol, commonly known as neutral spirit. Due to its flammability (see below) alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content above 70% by volume are not permitted to be transported in aircraft.

===Microdistilling===
Microdistilling (also known as craft distilling) began to re-emerge as a trend in the United States following the microbrewing and craft beer movement in the last decades of the 20th century.

==Flammability==

Liquor that contains 40% ABV (80 US proof) will catch fire if heated to about and if an ignition source is applied to it. This temperature is called its flash point. The flash point of pure alcohol is , less than average room temperature.

The flammability of liquor is applied in the cooking technique flambé.

The flash points of alcohol concentrations from 10% to 96% by weight are:
* 10% – – ethanol-based water solution
* 12.5% – about – wine
* 15% – – sake, mijiu, cheongju 
* 20% – – shōchū, fortified wine
* 30% – – strong shōchū
* 40% – – typical vodka, whisky or brandy
* 50% – – typical baijiu, strong whisky, bottled in bond whisky, typical blanche absinthe
* 60% – – strong baijiu, normal tsikoudia (called mesoraki or middle raki), barrel proof whisky, typical verte absinthe
* 70% – – slivovitz
* 80% – – strong absinthe
* 90% or more – – neutral grain spirit

==Serving==
Liquor can be served:
* Neat – at room temperature without any additional ingredient(s)
* Up – shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass
* Down – shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a rocks glass
* On the rocks – over ice cubes
* Blended or frozen – blended with ice
* With a simple mixer, such as club soda, tonic water, juice, or cola
* As an ingredient of a cocktail
* As an ingredient of a shooter
* With water
* With water poured over sugar (as with absinthe)

==Alcohol consumption by country==

The World Health Organization (WHO) measures and publishes alcohol consumption patterns in different countries. The WHO measures alcohol consumed by persons 15 years of age or older and reports it on the basis of liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita in a given year in a country.

In Europe, spirits (especially vodka) are more popular in the north and east of the continent.
==Health effects of alcohol==
Distilled spirits contain ethyl alcohol, the same chemical that is present in beer and wine, and as such, spirit consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the spirits and the timespan over which the consumption took place.

The short-term effects of alcohol consumption range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills and euphoria at lower doses to intoxication (drunkenness), to stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory &quot;blackouts&quot;), and central nervous system depression at higher doses. Cell membranes are highly permeable to alcohol, so once it is in the bloodstream, it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body. Alcohol can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During abstinence, residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns are the greatest predictors of relapse. 

Drinking more than 1–2 drinks a day increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. The risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking, which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are due to alcohol each year.
Unlike wine and perhaps beer, there is no evidence for a J-shaped health effect for the consumption of distilled alcohol. Long-term use can lead to an alcohol use disorder, an increased risk of developing physical dependence. cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer.

Alcoholism, also known as &quot;alcohol use disorder&quot;, is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. Alcoholism reduces a person&#x27;s life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third-leading cause of early death in the United States.

Consumption of alcohol in any quantity can cause cancer. Alcohol causes breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, and head-and-neck cancers. The more alcohol is consumed, the higher the cancer risk.

===Home-made liquor===
A survey of high school students in Alstahaug, Nordland county, revealed that adolescents consume alcohol at rates above the national average, with home-made liquor being prevalent and easily accessible, highlighting an urgent need for preventive measures.

<doc id="1318503" wikidata="Q273610" url="?curid=1318503" title="Bestseller">
<text>A bestseller is a book or other media noted for its top selling status, with bestseller lists published by newspapers, magazines, and book store chains. Some lists are broken down into classifications and specialties (novel, nonfiction book, cookbook, etc.). An author may also be referred to as a bestseller if their work often appears in a list. Well-known bestseller lists in the U.S. are published by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and IndieBound. The New York Times tracks book sales from national and independent bookstores, as well as sales from major internet retailers such as Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble.

In everyday use, the term &quot;bestseller&quot; is not usually associated with a specified level of sales, and may be used very loosely in publishers&#x27; publicity. Books of superior academic value tend not to be bestsellers, although there are exceptions. Lists simply give the highest-selling titles in the category over the stated period. Some books have sold many more copies than current &quot;bestsellers&quot;, but over a long period of time.

Blockbusters for films and chart-toppers in recorded music are similar terms, although, in film and music, these measures generally are related to industry sales figures for attendance, requests, broadcast plays, or units sold.

Particularly in the case of novels, a large budget and a chain of literary agents, editors, publishers, reviewers, retailers, librarians, and marketing efforts are involved in &quot;making&quot; bestsellers, that is, trying to increase sales.

Steinberg defined a bestseller as a book for which demand, within a short time of that book&#x27;s initial publication, vastly exceeds what is then considered to be big sales.

==Early best sellers==
The term &quot;best seller&quot; is first known to have been recorded in print in 1889 in the Kansas City, Missouri newspaper &quot;The Kansas Times &amp; Star&quot;, but the phenomenon of immediate popularity goes back to the early days of mass production of printed books. For earlier books, when the maximum number of copies that would be printed was relatively small, a count of editions is the best way to assess sales. Since effective copyright was slow to take hold, many editions were pirated well into the period of the Enlightenment, and without effective royalty systems in place, authors often saw little, if any, of the revenues for their popular works.
The earliest highly popular books were nearly all religious, but the Bible, as a large book, remained expensive until the nineteenth century. This tended to keep the numbers printed and sold low. Unlike today, it was important for a book to be short to be a bestseller, or it would be too expensive to reach a large audience. Very short works such as &quot;Ars moriendi&quot;, the &quot;Biblia pauperum&quot;, and versions of the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; were published as cheap block-books in large numbers of different editions in several languages in the fifteenth century. These were probably affordable items for most of the minority of literate members of the population. In 16th and 17th century England &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678) and abridged versions of &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; were the most broadly read books. &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719) and &quot;The Adventures of Roderick Random&quot; (1748) were early eighteenth century short novels with very large publication numbers, as well as gaining international success.

&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, a novel by Laurence Sterne, became a &quot;cult&quot; object in England and throughout Europe, with important cultural consequences among those who could afford to purchase books during the era of its publication. The same could be said of the works of Voltaire, particularly his comedic and philosophically satirical novel, &quot;Candide&quot;, which, according to recent research, sold more than 20,000 copies in its first month alone in 1759. Likewise, fellow French Enlightenment author Rousseau, especially his &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot; (1761) and of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s novel, &quot;Die Leiden des jungen Werthers&quot; (&quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;) (1774). As with some modern bestsellers, &quot;Werther&quot; spawned what today would be called a spin-off industry with items such as &quot;Werther eau de cologne&quot; and porcelain puppets depicting the main characters, being sold in large numbers.

By the time of Byron and Sir Walter Scott, effective copyright laws existed, at least in England, and many authors depended heavily on their income from their large royalties. America remained a zone of piracy until the mid-nineteenth century, a fact of which Charles Dickens and Mark Twain bitterly complained. By the middle of the 19th century, a situation akin to modern publication had emerged, where most bestsellers were written for a popular taste and are now almost entirely forgotten, with odd exceptions such as &quot;East Lynne&quot; (remembered only for the line &quot;Gone, gone, and never called me mother!&quot;), the wildly popular &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and Sherlock Holmes.

== Description and types of bestseller ==
Bestsellers are usually separated into fiction and non-fiction categories. Different list compilers have created a number of other subcategories. &quot;The New York Times&quot; was reported to have started its &quot;Children&#x27;s Books&quot; section in 2001 just to move the Harry Potter books out of the No. 1, 2, and 3 positions on their fiction chart, which the then three-book series had monopolized for over a year.

Bestsellers also may be ranked separately for hardcover and paperback editions. Typically, a hardcover edition appears first, followed in months or years by the much less expensive paperback version. Hardcover bestseller status may hasten the paperback release of the same, or slow the release, if hardcover sales are brisk enough. Some lists even have a third category, trade paperback bestsellers.

In the United Kingdom, a hardcover book could be considered a &quot;bestseller&quot; with sales ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 copies per week, and in Canada, bestsellers are determined according to weekly rankings in the country&#x27;s national print sales tracking service, BNC SalesData. There are many &quot;bestseller lists&quot; that display anywhere from 10 to 150 titles.

===Differences among lists===
Bestseller lists may vary widely, depending on the method used for calculating sales. The Indie bestseller lists, for example, use only sales numbers, provided by independently owned (non-chain) bookstores, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; list includes both wholesale and retail sales from a variety of sources. A book that sells well in gift shops and grocery stores may hit a &quot;New York Times&quot; list without ever appearing on an Indie list. &quot;USA Today&quot; has only one list, not hardcover/paperback, so that relative sales of these categories cannot be ascertained from it.

Lists from Amazon.com, the dominant online book retailer, are based only on sales from their own Web site, and are updated on an hourly basis. Wholesale sales figures are not factored into Amazon&#x27;s calculations. Numerous Web sites offer advice for authors about a temporary method to boost their book higher on Amazon&#x27;s list using carefully timed buying campaigns that take advantage of the frequent adjustments to rankings. For example, faith healing author Zhi Gang Sha has used this method to create a number of #1 bestsellers. The brief sales spike allows authors to tout that their book was an &quot;Amazon.com top 100 seller&quot; in marketing materials for books that actually have relatively low sales. Eventually book buyers may begin to recognize the relative differences among lists and settle upon which lists they will consult to determine their purchases.

The weight and price of a book may affect its positioning on lists. The Amazon.com list tends to favor hardcover, more expensive books, where the shipping charge is a smaller percentage of the overall purchase price or is sometimes free, and which tend to be more deeply discounted than paperbacks. Inexpensive mass market paperbacks tend to do better on &quot;The New York Times&quot; list than on Amazon&#x27;s. Indie and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; separate mass market paperbacks onto their own list.

Category structure affects the positioning of a book in other ways. A book that might be buried on the Indie hardcover fiction list could be positioned very well on &quot;The New York Times&quot; hardcover advice list or the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; religion hardcover list.

===Verifiability===
Bestseller reports from companies such as Amazon.com, which appear to be based strictly on auditable sales to the public, may be at odds with bestseller lists compiled from more casual data, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; lists&#x27; survey of retailers and publishers. The exact method for ranking &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller lists is a closely guarded secret.

This situation suggests a similar one in the area of popular music. In 1991, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine switched its chart data from manual reports filed by stores, to automated cash register data collected by a service called SoundScan. The conversion saw a dramatic shake-up in chart content from one week to the next.

Today, many lists come from automated sources. Booksellers may use their POS (point-of-sale) systems to report automatically to Book Sense. Wholesalers such as the giant Ingram Content Group have bestseller calculations similar to Amazon&#x27;s, but they are available only to subscribing retailers. Barnes &amp; Noble and other large retail chains collect sales data from retail outlets and their Web sites to build their own bestseller lists.

Nielsen BookScan U.S. is perhaps the most aggressive attempt to produce a completely automatic and trusted set of bestseller lists. They claim to be gathering data directly from cash registers at more than 4,500 retail locations, including independent bookstores, large chains such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Powell&#x27;s Books, and Borders (formerly), and the general retailer Costco. Unlike the consumer-oriented lists, BookScan&#x27;s data is extremely detailed and quite expensive. Subscriptions to BookScan cost up to $75,000 per year, but it can provide publishers and wholesalers with an accurate picture of book sales with regional and other statistical analyses.

===The making of a bestseller===
Ultimately, having a great number of buyers creates a bestseller; however, there is a distinct &quot;making of&quot; process that determines which books have the potential to achieve that status. Not all publishers rely on, nor strive for, bestsellers, as the survival of small presses indicates. Large publishing houses, on the other hand, are like major record labels and film studios, and require consistent high returns to maintain their large overhead. Thus, the stakes are high. It is estimated that 200,000 new books are published each year in the U.S., and less than 1% achieve bestseller status. Along the way, major players act as gatekeepers and enablers, including literary agents, editors, publishing houses, booksellers, and the media (particularly, publishers of book reviews and bestseller lists). While literature awards have a beneficial effect at least on sales of hard covers, their impact is not detectable beyond a benchmark of ca. 800,000 sold copies. The high visibility of an established and best-selling author is paramount in the equation also. In addition to writing the book, an author has to acquire representation and negotiate this publishing chain.

At least one scientific approach to creating bestsellers has been devised. In 2004, Didier Sornette, a professor of geophysics and a complex systems theorist at UCLA, using Amazon.com sales data, created a mathematical model for predicting bestseller potential based on very early sales results. This information could be used to identify a potential for bestseller status and recommend fine tuned advertising and publicity efforts accordingly. In 1995, the authors of a book called &quot;The Discipline of Market Leaders&quot; colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to Bookscan. Because of the ancillary benefits of making &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to #8 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks, also peaking at #1 on the &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage chart success often begets more chart success. And although such efforts are not illegal, they are considered highly unethical by publishers.

From what is described above, intrinsic properties of books (like style or content) are often ignored or even deemed as irrelevant for their success by consumer psychologists, literary scholars, economists and sociologists alike. The success of novels is instead said to be made by extrinsic factors like literary critics, publishers, media, conformity and other social influences. However, an elaborated model examining over a dozen external variables potentially influencing books sales could only explain less than 40% of differences in sales. Research found intrinsic properties of novels which do influence their success. For example, a smaller disparity between the frequency of emotional words and rational words was predictive for successful novels.

===Unread bestsellers===
Bestsellers have gained such great popularity that it has sometimes become fashionable to purchase them. Critics have pointed out that just because a book is purchased doesn&#x27;t mean it will be read. The rising length of bestsellers may mean that more of them are simply becoming bookshelf decor. In 1985 members of the staff of &quot;The New Republic&quot; placed coupons redeemable for $5 cash inside 70 books that were selling well, and none of them were sent in.

==Major publishers==
In April 2013 Penguin Random House was created to become the world&#x27;s largest publisher. The two major shareholders are Bertelsmann (53%) and Penguin Group (47%) owned by Pearson PLC.

Other major publishers include Thomson Reuters, Reed Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Hachette, McGraw Hill Education, John Wiley and Sons, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, Macmillan Publishers, and Harlequin Enterprises.

==Cultural role==
While the basic dictionary definition of &quot;bestseller&quot; is self-evident, &quot;a popular, top-selling book&quot;, the practical cultural definition is somewhat more complex. As consumer bestseller lists generally do not detail specific criteria, such as numbers sold, sales period, sales region, and so forth, a book becomes a bestseller mainly because an &quot;authoritative&quot; source says it is. Calling a book a &quot;top-selling&quot; title is not so impressive as calling it &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller&quot;. Although the former phrase is assumed to be derived from sales figures, the latter benefits from the high profile of the particular list. A book that is identified as a &quot;bestseller&quot; greatly improves its chance of selling to a much wider audience. In this way, &quot;bestseller&quot; has taken on its own popular meaning, rather independent of empirical data, by becoming a compromised product category and, in effect, attempting to create a marketing image. For example, a &quot;summer bestseller&quot; is usually determined long before the summer is over, and signals a book&#x27;s suitability for millions of lounging pool-side readers.

The use of the marketing phrase, &quot;underground bestseller&quot; further illustrates the independent-from-sales, self-defining aspect of the term. For example, publisher HarperCollins suggested the bestseller potential of &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; by announcing &quot;...four years after her award-winning, underground bestseller, &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot;...&quot; in the promotion. The book went on to achieve bestseller status in the 1990s. In reviews of the 2002 film of the same name, the novel&#x27;s bestseller status was cited routinely, as in &quot;compelling adaptation of Rebecca Wells&#x27; bestseller&quot;.

The famous Diogenes Publisher at Zürich (Swiss) started to talk about its own Worstsellers in 2006, and therewith brought a new mode-word into the German speaking European countries.

==Connection with the movie industry==
Bestsellers play a significant role in the mainstream movie industry. There is a long-standing Hollywood practice of turning bestsellers into feature films. Many, if not the majority, of modern movie &quot;classics&quot; began as bestsellers. On the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; fiction bestsellers of the year charts, we find: #1: &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003); #3. &quot;Jaws&quot; (1974); #2. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1971); #1. &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970); #2. &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1969); among many others. Several of each year&#x27;s fiction bestsellers ultimately are made into high-profile movies. Being a bestseller novel in the U.S. during the last forty years has guaranteed consideration for a big budget, wide-release movie.

<text>Maharaja Raol Sir Takhtsinhji Jaswantsinhji (6 January 185829 January 1896), was Maharaja of Bhavnagar, a Rajput chief of the Gohil clan, and ruler of Bhavnagar state in Kathiawar. He succeeded to the throne of Bhavnagar upon the death of his father, Jaswantsinhji, in 1870.

==Life==

Takhtsinhji attended the Delhi Durbar in 1877. During his minority studies, which ended on 5 April 1878, he was educated at the Rajkumar College, Rajkot being the first student. Afterward, he studied under an English officer, while the administration of the state was conducted jointly by Mr. E. H. Percival, a member of the Indian Civil Service, and Gaurishankar Udayshankar, C.S.I., one of the foremost native statesmen of India, who had served the state in various capacities since 1822.
At the age of twenty, Takhtsinhji found himself the ruler of a territory nearly in size. His first public act was to sanction a railway connecting his territory with one of the main trunk lines, which was the first enterprise of its kind on the part of a raja in western (if not all) India. The amount of commerce, trade, economic and social development of the state that came in the wake of this railway confirmed Takhtsinhji as supporting a policy of progressive administration. Further educational establishments, hospitals, dispensaries, trunk roads, bridges, handsome edifices, and other public works projects followed.

Takhtsinhji was awarded the Empress of India Gold Medal in 1877, and knighted as a KCSI in 1881. In 1886, he inaugurated a system of constitutional rule, by placing several departments in the hands of four members of a council of state under his own presidency. This innovation—which had the support of the governor of Bombay, Lord Reay—provoked a virulent attack upon the chief, who brought his defamers to trial at the High Court of Bombay. The punishment of the ringleaders broke up a blackmailing system to which rajas were regularly exposed. The public spirit toward Takhtsinhji in freeing his brother chiefs from blackmail was widely acknowledged throughout India, as well as by the British authorities.

In 1886, he was promoted to GCSI, and five years later his hereditary title of &quot;Thakur&quot; was raised to that of &quot;Maharaja&quot;. In 1893 he took advantage of the opening of the Imperial Institute to visit England in order to pay personal homage to Queen Victoria, then sovereign of the British Empire. During that occasion, the University of Cambridge awarded him the degree of LL.D.

As the first pupil of Rajkumar College, Rajkot, Takhtsinhji became its greatest patron and benefactor following his accession to the throne of Bhavnagar. He was also a great benefactor to Gujarat College, Fergusson College, and the Wadhwan Girassia School, as well as several girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s schools. He founded Samaldas Arts College in 1885, which he named after the later Diwan of State, Samaldas Mehta. During his reign, he undertook intensive developments, reformed the revenue department, erected water works and modern docks, extended medical relief, built a port, bridges, hospitals, and schools and worked to and modernize Bhavnagar. He died at the Moti Bagh Palace on 29 January 1896 at the age of 38. He was succeeded as Maharaja of Bhavnagar by his eldest son, Bhavsinhji II.

Over his life, Takhtsinhji was known by the following titles:

<text>Gloria Loring-Lagler (born Gloria Jean Goff, December 10, 1946) is an American singer and actress. She is known for playing Liz Chandler on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for six years (1980–86, 2024). She and singer-actor Carl Anderson performed the duet &quot;Friends and Lovers,&quot; which reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1986.

== Early life ==
Gloria Jean Goff was born in New York City, the daughter of Dorothy Ann (née Tobin), a singer, and Gerald &quot;Buzzy&quot; Lewis Goff, a professional trumpet player with the Tommy Dorsey big band as well as other renowned swing groups; a salesman and hospitality/restaurant industry consultant.

== Career ==
Loring began her music career at age 14, singing with a folk group known as Those Four. Loring released her first album in 1968. It was titled &quot;Today&quot; on MGM Records. Several singles, including cover versions of Fred Neil&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot; and Roger Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;New World in the Morning&quot; were released on the Evolution label, though none charted. She also released, as a single, an early cover version of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot; in 1968.

She went on to perform on a wide range of television shows in the late 1960s and 1970s, from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (Season 1, Episode 4, which first aired October 2, 1967) to the Academy Awards ceremony. Signed to Atco Records, she released the single &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, produced by Mike Post, in 1977 under the alias Cody Jameson, and it became her first chart single, climbing to No. 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also appearing on the Adult Contemporary and Country Charts.

In March 1977, she flew to Toronto to be the special guest star on the popular weekly variety program &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot; which was seen all across the United States and Canada. The program was produced by her husband Alan Thicke. Loring performed &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; and performed a duet with Vinton on &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;.

In 1978 and 1979, Loring and then-husband Alan Thicke composed the theme songs to &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. There were two versions of the &quot;Facts of Life&quot; theme song that Loring sang. One version was used from seasons two through six, and a second was used from seasons seven to nine.

Her son, Brennan, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1979. A year later, Loring joined &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and got the idea to create and self-publish the &quot;Days Of Our Lives Celebrity Cookbook&quot; to raise money for diabetes research. Volume One was published in 1981 and the follow-up Volume Two in 1983. The cookbooks, along with her recording &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, raised more than $1 million for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (&quot;JDRF&quot;). She followed that success with three commercially published books, &quot;Kids, Food and Diabetes&quot;, &quot;Parenting a Child with Diabetes&quot;, and &quot;Living with Type 2 Diabetes: Moving Past the Fear&quot;.

For more than 30 years she has served as a spokesperson for JDRF. JDRF was the official philanthropy of her college sorority, Alpha Gamma Delta, before shifting its focus to fighting hunger in 2017.

In 1980, when Loring joined the NBC daytime soap &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as chanteuse Liz Chandler, the show was going through a dry spell, with many veterans dropped and many new faces alienating long-time fans. Of the nine new characters introduced in the 1980–1981 season, only Liz garnered a fan following, and was the only one to have her contract renewed. For three years, in real-life, Loring dated Don Diamont, the actor who played Carlo Forenza who was murdered by her TV husband Dr. Neil Curtis. Loring returned to the show in December 2024. 

In 1986, Loring scored a No. 2 Pop and No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit record in the United States with &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, with Carl Anderson (also a No. 1 country hit in 1986 for Eddie Rabbitt and Juice Newton under the title &quot;Both to Each Other&quot;). She originally performed &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; more than a year before it hit the charts. Her performance of the song generated the largest mail response of any song in NBC daytime history. First recorded as a duet with Anderson (who appeared on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; to sing the song with Loring) in 1985, its release as a single was delayed for a year by legal complications.

Loring left &quot;Days&quot; in 1986 and made sporadic film and television appearances over the next few decades. Her main efforts were spent in theater and in her recording career (though &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; was her only major hit single).

In 2003, Loring released her first holiday album, &quot;You Make It Christmas&quot;. In 2008, she released &quot;A Playlist&quot;, which included a new recording of the song &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; with Carl Anderson, recorded one year before he died.

Loring&#x27;s book, &quot;Coincidence Is God&#x27;s Way of Remaining Anonymous&quot;, is a spiritual autobiography of how a series of coincidences transformed her life. It was released in October 2012 by HCI, Inc.

<doc id="1318535" wikidata="Q967326" url="?curid=1318535" title="Subaru Tecnica International">
<text>Subaru Tecnica International (in ), or STI (prior to 2006, STi), is Subaru Corporation&#x27;s motorsports division. STI, along with Prodrive of the UK, specialized in the preparation of a variety of vehicles for the Subaru World Rally Team which competed in the World Rally Championship (WRC). It was founded in 1988 by Subaru Corporation (then known as Fuji Heavy Industries), the parent company of Subaru, to promote the company&#x27;s performance-oriented identity.

==History==

Subaru Tecnica International Inc. (STi) was established in 1988 by Fuji Heavy Industries to take over all of Subaru&#x27;s motorsport activities and participate in the World Rally Championship (WRC). Subaru was seen as one of the world&#x27;s top rally racing teams, but is no longer active at a factory level in the WRC.

The seeds of STI were planted in 1972, when Subaru campaigned the Leone in the Australia’s Southern Cross Rally. After their first foray into competition, Subaru made history with the first AWD car entered in the World Rally Championship (WRC), when the Leone 4WD entered the Safari Rally in 1980. 

STi was then officially founded by Noriyuki Koseki and Ryuichiro Kuze in 1988. Previously, Koseki had helped prepare a Subaru FF-1 that was entered into the 1971 Baja 500 by San Bernardino Subaru dealer Jack Coyle. Although the FF-1 did not finish that year, it was able to complete the 1973 race and is now part of the Subaru of America historical collection. Koseki would go on to campaign Subarus privately in the Safari Rally starting in 1979.

===Endurance record===
STi president Ryuichiro Kuze partnered with British firm Prodrive in 1989 to develop a rally car using the Subaru Legacy chassis. The resulting performance model was the Legacy RS, which produced mated to a five speed gearbox and weighing just over 2,600 pounds; it was manufactured by Subaru to homologate the type for FIA Group A racing. The vehicle had a top speed of 155 miles per hour, which was considered extremely powerful at the time.
One of the first activities that STi carried out was setting the world record for endurance driving using a fleet of three modified Subaru Legacy RS sedans, averaging over most of January 1989. The founder of STi, Noriyuki Koseki, coordinated the FIA World Land Endurance Record attempt and drove one of the cars. The Legacy RS used a 2.0-liter EJ20 turbo engine; STi modified the record-setting cars by tuning the suspension and improving the aerodynamics. That November, Subaru began marketing an upgraded Legacy RS with many of the same STi modifications as the Legacy RS Type RA (Record Attempt), limited to a production run of 100 examples. Low-volume Type RA production continued after that initial model, and in 1992 the Legacy Touring Wagon STi was marketed with similar modifications.

===World Rally Championship===
Subaru had participated in WRC races since 1980, albeit with limited success by 1988, when STi was founded. Subaru first campaigned the Prodrive-developed Legacy RS in the 1990 WRC season, finishing fourth in the constructor&#x27;s standings that year. Despite adding Colin McRae to the Subaru World Rally Team in 1991 and winning three straight British Rally Championships from 1991 to 1993 (McRae/Ringer, 1991–92; Burns/Reid 1993) the Legacy RS did not win an individual WRC race until the 1993 Rally New Zealand (McRae/Ringer).

In 1992, with its rally competitors fielding smaller and lighter automobiles, Subaru began to sell the Impreza WRX (World Rally eXperimental) and homologated it for Group A as the Impreza 555; a Prodrive-modified Impreza 555 was campaigned starting with the 1994 WRC season and the new WRC car immediately achieved a podium finish on its debut, with Ari Vatanen coming second at the 1993 1000 Lakes Rally. The Impreza 555 featured a 2.0-litre intercooled turbocharged engine with 250 horsepower, upgraded suspension that could take on more aggressive potholes and jumps, as well as a short shifting transmission which made switching gears more accessible and quicker. 

Like the Legacy RS before it, an Impreza WRX Type RA was marketed in Japan for 1992; the RA deleted power windows, air conditioning, and the anti-lock braking system. In 1994, Subaru introduced the WRX STi; the STi were taken from the regular production line and modified to improve output and stiffen the chassis compared to the regular WRX. Meanwhile in the WRC, the Impreza 555 gave Subaru the Constructor&#x27;s Championship in the World Rally Championship for three consecutive years between 1995 and 1997.

STi introduced the first of what it would eventually call its &quot;S-line&quot; of limited production cars in 1998, celebrating its consecutive streak of WRC constructor&#x27;s championships as well as the 40th anniversary of Subaru: the 22B was limited to just 400 cars, reportedly selling out in 30 minutes. The 22B was followed by a string of limited production special editions of the WRX STi with outputs that exceeded the Japanese car manufacturers&#x27; &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; to keep output below : S201 (2000), S202 (2002), S203 (2004), and S204 (2005).

At the end of 2008, Subaru announced that it would withdraw from the WRC starting with the 2009 season, citing the ongoing global recession.

===Nürburgring 24 Hours===
STI first competed in the annual Nürburgring 24 Hours race in 2008. Prior to that, Subaru had used the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; circuit to prove its production models since 1992. The WRX STI was first raced at the track&#x27;s 24 Hours event in 2005 by a private team, finishing 14th overall and 2nd in its class. In 2008, the first factory-backed entry finished 57th overall and 5th in the SP6 class. For 2009, STI switched to the SP3T class (production cars equipped with a turbo engine with a displacement of 2-litres or less) and finished 33rd overall, 5th in the SP3T class.

Ahead of the 2010 event, driver Tommi Mäkinen drove a prototype WRX STI (GVB, widebody sedan), covering a &quot;Nordschleife&quot; lap in 7 minutes 55 seconds; the car was specially prepared with a lightweight aluminum bonnet and a larger turbo from the R205 production car. That year STI campaigned the WRX STI (GRB, widebody hatchback) to 24th overall and 4th in the SP3T class. In 2011, STI claimed the SP3T class title and finished 21st overall. That year, the S206 was released with a limited-production NBR (Nürburgring) Challenge Package, which replaced the steel roof with one made of carbon fiber, and was equipped with a special unfinished (&quot;dry&quot;) carbon rear wing.
STI repeated as the SP3T class champion in 2012, but finished second in 2013 (26th overall). With the next generation of the WRX STI (VA) debuting in 2014, STI finished 4th in class, 32nd overall. Subaru took its third SP3T class win in 2015, finishing 18th overall, and repeated as SP3T class champions in 2016.

Subaru were unable to repeat their title in 2017, with the car forced to retire due to a fire in the engine compartment; at the time, the team were in second place within the class. The team won its fifth and sixth SP3T class championships in 2018 (62nd overall) and 2019 (18th overall).

Due to the difficulties of racing overseas during the COVID-19 pandemic, Subaru withdrew from the 2020 and 2021 races. Subaru entered the 2022 Nürburgring 24-Hour Race, held in late May, but was forced to retire before the end of the race due to a tire blowout leading to a crash. Before the crash, the WRX STI NBR Challenge 2022 was in second place for the SP3T class.

===SUPER GT===

STI also participates in the GT300 class of the Super GT series, campaigning the Legacy B4 GT300 starting in 2009, then switching to the BRZ GT300 from 2012 onward. In 2021, Subaru won the series championship with the updated BRZ GT300. Previously, the Subaru team&#x27;s best finishes were fourth place (in 2011 and 2013).

===Future development===
At the 2022 Tokyo Auto Salon, Subaru unveiled the STI E-RA Concept, an all-wheel drive two-seat racing car developed by STI. The STI E-RA Concept is equipped with a carbon fiber body and four electric motors, one at each wheel, enabling torque vectoring by varying the output of each motor; the aggregate maximum power output is and of torque, per motor. The motors were developed and manufactured by Yamaha Motor Company. Because the car was designed to meet the requirements of the FIA Electric GT Championship, which is scheduled to hold its inaugural season in 2023, the automotive press have speculated that STI intend to campaign the E-RA, which will require the car to be homologated with a street-legal version under GT3 rules.

==Subaru models with STI trim==

STI versions of the Impreza, Forester and the Legacy have been marketed as limited edition vehicles in certain markets. STI also designs upgraded parts, mostly suspension related, for use on other Subaru vehicles.

The Subaru Impreza WRX and the Subaru Legacy B4 both come in high performance STI editions (formerly capitalized &quot;STi&quot; before the 2006 model year), designed by STI. The STI offers many advantages over the WRX, such as a six-speed manual transmission (different from the 2015+ WRX 6MT) with a helical (Suretrac in &#x27;04 models) limited slip front differential, driver controlled center differential(DCCD), IHI VF39 turbocharger (VF43 in 2007, VF48 from 2008 on), BBS lightweight alloy wheels, a mechanical rear limited slip differential and Brembo brakes. The WRX STI has Recaro style bucket seats and a MOMO steering wheel.
The WRX STI was the first and so far only STI vehicle made available to North American consumers. While the WRX was first released for the North American market in 2001 for the 2002 model year, the limited production Impreza WRX STI sedan with 300 hp and 310 foot pounds of torque did not hit the market until 2004, and the USDM version having a number of changes when compared to the JDM - most notably the 2.5L EJ257 as opposed to the 2.0L EJ207 found in the JDM Spec model. This had a base price tag between $35,000-$40,000.

STI also released Legacys kitted out in full STI trim. These are rare and sought after by Subaru enthusiasts, and marketed as &#x27;Tuned by STi&#x27; They were only released new in Japan (JDM) and New Zealand (NZDM) this has been throughout the 2005-2007 Legacys. The higher performance &#x27;STI Legacys&#x27; are produced in limited numbers for the Japanese Market only and are known as S-Line, (see more below) similar to what has been carried out in the Impreza model range. Starting with the S401 in 2002 which was based on a BES Legacy Sedan RSK (400 Produced) and the S402 in 2008, based on the BL/BP Legacy (402 Produced). Both of these had 6MT Transmissions, EJ20 in the S401 and EJ25 in the S402. STi has also put its name on a number of other Subaru models, using the &#x27;Ts&#x27; moniker, these are largely sold in Japan only and have STi branded interior parts, strut braces and occasionally suspension components. In 2016 an STI kit was built for the redesigned Crosstrek models which included STI branded wheels, hatchback spoiler, and shift knobs for both automatic and manual variants. 

STI also released the STI Forester firstly based on the SF5 variant in 2001, this was called the Forester STI II Type M. This was limited to 800 Units, and had an increase of power to 250PS, utilizing a special ECU. Special struts and coil springs were installed and its brakes were modified to large diameters; 16 inches in the front and 14 in the rear, while a brake-cooling duct was also added to the front bumper. 17-inch forged aluminium wheels by RAYS were fitted together with 225/45R17 tyres. As for the exterior, special front and rear bumpers, large rear spoiler, and side under spoilers were also attached. The interior featured a MOMO leather sport steering wheel (with cherry red stitching), and a leather bound shift knob and brake lever. Its suede effect seat fabric was even embossed with the STI logo. There was also another STi Forester released in 2005 using the SG Chassis. This used the EJ257 Engine. 

Some Subaru enthusiasts have requested that the manufacturer install the STI engine in the BRZ to provide extra power, but there is concern that a more powerful BRZ would compete directly with the WRX. Drawings of a BRZ STI exist online and concepts have been shown at auto shows, but Subaru has yet to release an official statement.

===S-line===
The highest-performance automobiles sold by Subaru are limited-production models tuned by STI and designated as the &quot;S-line&quot;. There is also a line of limited-production cars with upgraded performance noted as &quot;tuned by STI&quot; or &quot;tS&quot;.

<doc id="1318555" wikidata="Q363671" url="?curid=1318555" title="John Hall (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Sir John Hall ( 18 December 1824 – 25 June 1907) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 12th premier of New Zealand from 1879 to 1882. He was born in Kingston upon Hull, England, the third son of George Hall, a captain in the navy. At the age of ten he was sent to school in Switzerland and his education continued in Paris and Hamburg. After returning to England and being employed by the Post Office, at the age of 27 he decided to emigrate. He was also Mayor of Christchurch.

==Migration to New Zealand==
After reading a book on sheep farming, Hall emigrated to New Zealand, on the &quot;Samarang&quot;, arriving in Lyttelton on 31 July 1852. His brothers George and Thomas followed him to New Zealand soon after. He developed one of the first large scale sheep farming runs in Canterbury.

==Political offices==


 
 

In 1853, he was elected to the Canterbury Provincial Council. He would later rise through the ranks of magistrate, was the first town council Chairman in Christchurch (the forerunner to the position of mayor, 1862 and 1863), and Postmaster-General. In Parliament he represented the electorates of Christchurch Country 1855–60 (resigned in early 1860), Heathcote 1866–70 &amp; 1871–72 (resigned), Selwyn 1879–83 (resigned) &amp; 1887–90, and Ellesmere 1890–93 (retired).

In the 1865–66 election, he contested the Heathcote electorate against G. Buckley, and they received 338 and 239 votes, respectively.

Hall was a member of the Legislative Council from 1876 to 1879 before resigning, wishing to re-enter the lower house. Thinking his previous seat of Heathcote unsuitable for his candidacy he accepted the offer of the retiring Cecil Fitzroy to stand in his vacated seat of Selwyn and was elected for it unopposed at the 1879 general election. At the same election the opposition leader, William Fox, was defeated leading Fox to invite Hall to succeed him on 6 September. Hall accepted the leadership and at the first opposition caucus following the election he was confirmed as leader, being elected unanimously.

===Premier of New Zealand===
On 8 October 1879, he was appointed the Premier of New Zealand, where his ministry carried out reforms of the male suffrage (extending voting rights) and dealt with a conflict between settlers and Māori at Parihaka, although poor health caused him to resign the position less than three years later. In the 1882 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.

===Immigration===

Although Chinese immigrants were invited to New Zealand by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce, prejudice against them quickly led to calls for restrictions on immigration. Following the example of anti-Chinese poll taxes enacted by California in 1852 and by Australian states in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, John Hall&#x27;s government passed the Chinese Immigration Act 1881. This imposed a £10 tax per Chinese person entering New Zealand, and permitted only one Chinese immigrant for every 10 tons of cargo. Richard Seddon&#x27;s government increased the tax to £100 per head in 1896, and tightened the other restriction to only one Chinese immigrant for every 200 tons of cargo.

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===
Hall took an active interest in women&#x27;s rights. He moved the Parliamentary Bill that gave women in New Zealand the vote (1893), (the first country in the world to do so), he became the honorary Mayor of Christchurch, for the New Zealand International Exhibition from 1 November 1906 to 15 April 1907.

=== Personal life and death ===
Despite the distances involved, Hall made several visits back to England and maintained his contacts there, especially with the Leathersellers&#x27; Company, of which he was a Liveryman for 55 years. A long-time advocate of electoral reform, he addressed a proportional representation meeting in London (England) in 1894.

Hall had married Rose Dryden in England, daughter of William Dryden of Kingston upon Hull, after returning there in 1860. They went back to New Zealand in 1863. They had five children and one of their granddaughters, Mary Grigg, later became an MP for the National Party.

Hall died in Christchurch on 25 June 1907, shortly after the International Exhibition had finished. He is buried in the St. John cemetery in Hororata.

<doc id="1318559" wikidata="Q716737" url="?curid=1318559" title="Arup Group">
<text>Arup (officially Arup Group Limited) is a British multinational professional services firm headquartered in London that provides design, engineering, architecture, planning, and advisory services across every aspect of the built environment. It employs about 17,000 people in over 90 offices across 35 countries, and has participated in projects in over 160 countries.

Arup was established in 1946 by Sir Ove Arup as Ove N. Arup Consulting Engineers. Through its involvement in high-profile projects such as the Sydney Opera House, it became well known for undertaking complex and challenging projects. In 1970, Arup stepped down from actively leading the company, setting out the principles which have continued to guide its operation.

Arup&#x27;s ownership is structured as a trust whose beneficiaries are its employees, past and present, who receive a share of its operating profit each year.

== History ==

=== Founding the firm ===
The company was founded in London in 1946 as &quot;Ove N. Arup Consulting Engineers&quot; by Sir Ove Arup. Arup had established himself in the 1930s as an expert in reinforced concrete, known for projects such as the Penguin Pool at London Zoo. According to the architectural author Ian Volner, Arup&#x27;s vision when establishing the company came out of a combination of his wartime experiences and a progressive-minded philosophy broadly aligning with early modernism, was for the organisation to be a force for peace and social betterment in the postwar world. To this end, it would employ professionals of diverse disciplines that could work together to produce projects of greater quality than was achievable by them working in isolation, a concept known as &#x27;Total Design&#x27;.

=== Early years ===
As the company grew, Arup spurned the common practice amongst its rivals of acquiring other companies; instead, it pursued natural growth, opening up new offices at locations where the potential for work had been identified.

During 1963, together with the architect Philip Dowson, a new division of the company, Arup Associates, was formed.

Within 25 years of its establishment, the firm had become well known for its design work for the built environment, acquiring a reputation for its competence at undertaking projects that were structurally and/or logistically complex. Arup himself worked on multiple projects during the firm&#x27;s early years, including the Sydney Opera House, where he was lead engineer, and which author Peter Jones credited with launching Arup into the premier league of engineering consultancies. The Opera House was the first application of computer calculations to an engineering project, using the Ferranti Pegasus computer to generate models.

During Arup&#x27;s lifetime, the company would also work on high-profile projects such as the &#x27;inside-out&#x27; Centre Pompidou with Rogers &amp; Piano, and the HSBC headquarters with Norman Foster &amp; Partners.

=== The Key Speech ===
1970 was a particularly transformative year for the firm; 24 years after founding the company, Arup opted to retire from actively leading the company. At the time, the firm (then &quot;Ove&quot; &quot;Arup &amp; Partners&quot;) was made up of several independent practices spread across the globe, so prior to his departure, Arup delivered his &#x27;Key Speech&#x27; on 9 July in Winchester to all his partners from the various practices. The speech set out the aims of the firm and identified the principles of governance by which they might be achieved. These included quality of work, total architecture, humane organisation, straight and honorable dealings, social usefulness, and the reasonable prosperity of its members.

Arup&#x27;s philosophy work on influential projects was the subject of a dedicated retrospective at the V&amp;A Museum in 2016.

== Operations ==

Arup is an employee-owned business, with all staff owning a stake in the company and part of a global profit share.

By 2013, Arup was operating 90 offices across 60 countries around the world. These offices are elaborately interconnected by shared internet-based collaborative working packages and communication systems that can, where required, enable a single project to be worked on by multiple offices across a seamless, 24-hour working cycle. However, it is more common for individual offices to specialise in working on an assigned subsection of a project rather than continuously exchanging.

The BBC Television and RIBA documentary &quot;The Brits who Built the Modern World&quot; highlighted Arup&#x27;s collaboration with architects and described Arup as &quot;the engineering firm which Lord Norman Foster and his peers Lord Richard Rogers, Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, Sir Michael Hopkins and Sir Terry Farrell most frequently relied upon.&quot;

The firm has published an annual sustainability report since 2008, and is involved in several projects around the world aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions, such as Dongtan Eco-City, which is planned to be zero waste, and the High Speed 2 Interchange Station, which is the first railway station in the world to achieve BREEAM &#x27;outstanding certification.

Arup also runs community engagement programmes comprising initiatives to combat homelessness, improve sanitation in disaster relief programmes, and disaster recovery after earthquakes. They also engage in partnerships with governments, NGOs, think tanks, and other advocacy groups.

<text>Birgit Rausing (born 26 October 1924) is a Swedish art historian, philanthropist, a former billionaire heiress and the widow of Gad Rausing (1922–2000).

==Biography==
She is the daughter of Swedish landscape painter Henry Mayne (1891–1975). In 1944 her father-in-law Ruben Rausing (1895–1983) founded Tetra Pak, which revolutionized the packaging of liquids such as juices and milk. The company was inherited by his sons Gad and Hans. In 1996, Gad bought his brother&#x27;s half of the company. When Gad died in 2000, his wife Birgit and their three children inherited packaging giant Tetra Laval.

Birgit Rausing and her family had an estimated net worth of US$13.0 billion in 2010. She is the third wealthiest person in Sweden, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

==Gad and Birgit Rausing Library==

The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) library has been renamed as Gad &amp; Birgit Rausing Library to acknowledge the donation provided by the Rausing family to construct the library building. Dennis Jönsson, CEO Tetra Pak inaugurated the Library in March 2011.

<doc id="1318570" wikidata="Q3519156" url="?curid=1318570" title="Tetra Laval">
<text>Tetra Laval is a Swiss-domiciled multinational corporation of Swedish origin, with headquarters in Pully (Vaud), Switzerland. The Tetra Laval Group provides packaging, processing and distribution products for a range of foodstuffs, including liquids, fruit and vegetables, ice-cream and processed food, additionally offering systems for agricultural production and herd management. The group operates in five business segments: milk production, food preparation, food processing, food packaging and food distribution. The Tetra Laval Group includes Tetra Pak, DeLaval and Sidel. Tetra Laval was included in the Thomson Reuters 2011 list of Top 100 Global Innovators.

==The Tetra Laval Group==

The Tetra Laval Group consists of three independent industry groups. 
Tetra Pak develops and manufactures processing, distribution and packaging systems for food and liquids.
DeLaval develops and produces systems for milk production and animal husbandry. Sidel develops and manufactures plastic packaging and complete bottling lines.

Tetra Laval AB operates as a subsidiary to the holding company Tetra Laval International SA. Tetra Laval International SA provides the financing, risk management and investment support needed by the Tetra Laval Group, with the additional responsibility of managing overall legal and financial structure and tax planning.

==History==

The Tetra Laval Group was created in 1993 after Tetra Pak&#x27;s acquisition of Alfa Laval in 1991 with the aim of forming a coherent structure under which both companies could operate within their respective fields. The part of Alfa Laval that was involved in processing was integrated into Tetra Pak, while the part that produced farm equipment was recreated as a separate entity under the name of Alfa Laval Agri, later renamed DeLaval after Alfa Laval&#x27;s founder Gustaf de Laval.

In 2000, Tetra Laval sold the part of Alfa Laval that was not directly involved in their business to Swedish investment company Industri Kapital, however retaining a part of the shares. In 2001, Tetra Laval acquired French plastic bottle manufacturer Sidel. The merger was subject to anti-competitivity scrutiny from the European Commission but was finally allowed to go through after an appeal to the European Court of Justice.

==Facts and figures==
Employees in 2019:

==Environment==
The Tetra Laval Group has an established policy for environmental excellence and sustainability. However, Tetra Pak products have been identified as solid waste problems by many NGOs and environmental groups. Unlike aluminum cans, plastic or glass bottles, it cannot be recycled in municipal recycling facilities. In order to stave off regulation, the company has engineered a strong campaign. In 2011, Tetra Pak published a set of sustainability targets, which included maintaining its emission levels at the same level until 2020 and increasing recycling by 100 percent.

==Community projects==
Tetra Laval supports for community projects such as disaster relief. In 2010, Tetra Laval provided in-kind and financial relief support to Haiti, Russia, Pakistan and Brazil and, in early 2011, Japan.

== Ownership ==
It is owned by the Rausing family.

<doc id="1318591" wikidata="Q2037515" url="?curid=1318591" title="Lego Baby">
<text>Lego Baby (stylized as LEGO Baby) was a line by the Lego Group of bricks and other elements for young children of 6 to 18 months. The line was intended for babies who are too young to play with regular Lego Duplo bricks (1–5 years). The Lego baby bricks are larger to prevent babies from swallowing them.

The bricks&#x27; compatibility with other Lego elements is fairly minimal. Regular Lego bricks of the same length and width can be attached to the bottom of the bricks and adapter pieces are also available.

The range has expanded to include sets among others with figures, animals, trains, toys making sound, baby walkers, general baby toys and products made of textile.

In September 1995 the line was introduced under the name Duplo Primo. The first four sets were #2080, #2082, #2084 and #2086. From 1997 the line was sold under the name Lego Primo, with a yellow elephant logo. The line was extended with 10 new sets. In 1999 the age indication changed from 6–18 months to 3–36 months.

The Primo name was dropped after 1999 because it was feared to have a negative association with the word &quot;preemie&quot;, which is a term that refers to medically fragile babies born before 36 weeks gestation. As a result of the negative connotation surrounding the term, Lego rebranded Primo as Lego Baby in 2000. New sets included sets made with textiles. In 2001 the company produced a few licensed sets including Mickey Mouse, in cooperation with The Walt Disney Company.

In 2002, a big difference appeared. The Lego Baby line had been combined with Lego Duplo line to make &quot;&#x27;Lego Explore&quot;. Already in 2003 it became clear that people didn&#x27;t recognise Lego Explore as Lego Duplo or Lego Baby. At the beginning of 2004, there came special notices that a set included Duplo elements.

Mid-2004, Lego revived the Lego Baby line. Several new sets were launched and the line got a teddy bear logo instead of the yellow elephant. The elephant that was used as the logo of the Primo brand, was used in blue for the Lego Quatro line from 2004. 

Lego Baby was discontinued in 2006.

<text>172 (one hundred [and] seventy-two) is the natural number following 171 and preceding 173.

==In mathematics==
172 is a part of a near-miss for being a counterexample to Fermat&#x27;s last theorem, as 1353 + 1383 = 1723 − 1. This is only the third near-miss of this form, two cubes adding to one less than a third cube. It is also a &quot;thickened cube number&quot;, half an odd cube (73 = 343) rounded up to the next integer.

<doc id="1318599" wikidata="Q1710389" url="?curid=1318599" title="Hash browns">
<text>Hash browns, also spelled hashed browns and hashbrowns, are a popular American breakfast food consisting of finely julienned potatoes that have been fried until golden brown. Hash browns are a staple breakfast item at diners in North America, where they are often fried on a large, common cooktop or grill.

Hash browns are a popular mass-produced product sold in refrigerated, frozen and dehydrated forms.

== History ==
The following recipe for &quot;brown hashed potatoes&quot; appears in the 1835 edition of the &quot;Minnesota Farmers&#x27; Institute Annual&quot;:

Hash browns first started appearing on breakfast menus in New York City in the 1890s. The name was gradually changed to &quot;hash-brown potatoes&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;hash&quot; is derived from the French word &quot;hacher&quot;, which means to hack or chop. This means hashed browned potatoes literally translates to &quot;chopped and fried potatoes&quot;.

== Preparation ==

A chef may prepare hash browns by either grating potato or forming riced potatoes into patties before frying with onions (moisture and potato starch can hold them together); however, if a binding agent is added (egg or flour for example), such a preparation constitutes a potato pancake. 

Hash browns are sometimes made into patty form and frozen for ease of handling, and the compact, flat shape can also be cooked in a toaster oven or toaster. For best results, in both cooking and flavor, it is recommended that hash browns be made using starchy potatoes such as russet potatoes. If a dish of hash browned potatoes incorporates chopped meat, leftovers, or other vegetables, it is commonly referred to as &quot;hash&quot;.

Hash browns are also manufactured as a dehydrated food, which is sometimes used by backpackers.

In the United States, &quot;hash browns&quot; may refer to shredded, pan-fried potatoes or diced/cubed potatoes, the latter also being known as country fried potatoes or home fries. Some recipes add diced or chopped onions, and when bell peppers are added to cubed home fries the dish is known as Potatoes O&#x27;Brien.

<doc id="1318611" wikidata="Q289590" url="?curid=1318611" title="Susanne Klatten">
<text>Susanne Hanna Ursula Klatten (&quot;née&quot; Quandt, born 28 April 1962) is a German billionaire heiress, the daughter of Herbert and Johanna Quandt. As of January 2022, her net worth was estimated at US$23.4 billion, and the richest woman in Germany and the 50th richest person in the world according to the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;.

== Education ==
Klatten was born in Bad Homburg, West Germany. After gaining a degree in business finance, she worked for the advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam in Frankfurt from 1981 to 1983. This was followed by a course in marketing and management at the University of Buckingham, and an MBA from IMD Business School in Lausanne specialising in advertising.

She gained further business experience in London with Dresdner Bank, the Munich branch of management consultants McKinsey and the bank Bankhaus Reuschel &amp; Co.She has often worked under the name Susanne Kant.

Klatten has received several honorary titles, including Honorary Senator of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2004, and is a Honorary Graduate at University of Buckingham in 2022.

==Investments==
On her father&#x27;s death she inherited his 50.1% stake in pharmaceutical and chemicals manufacturer Altana. She sits on Altana&#x27;s supervisory board and helped transform it into a world-class corporation in the German DAX list of 30 top companies. In 2006 Altana AG sold its pharmaceutical activities to Nycomed for €4.5 billion, leaving only its speciality chemicals business. The €4.5 billion was distributed to shareholders as a dividend. Altana maintained its stock exchange listing and Klatten remained its majority shareholder. 
In 2009, she bought almost all shares she did not already own in Altana. Altana and SKion, which are both wholly owned by Susanne Klatten, are shareholder of Landa Digital Printing with together 46% since 2018. Landa Digital Printing is a company of the Israeli entrepreneur and inventor Benny Landa in the field of digital printing and nanotechnology. 

Her father also left her a 12.50% stake in BMW, which increased to 19.2% following the death of her mother in 2015. She was appointed to the supervisory board of BMW with her brother Stefan Quandt in 1997.

German graphite maker SGL Carbon said on 16 March 2009 that Klatten owns options to raise her stake in SGL from 8% to almost a quarter of the shares but no more than that.

== Quandt family activities during WWII ==
The Hanns Joachim Friedrichs Award winning documentary film &quot;The Silence of the Quandts&quot; by the German public broadcaster ARD described in October 2007 the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. The family&#x27;s Nazi past was not well known, but the documentary film revealed this to a wide audience and confronted the Quandts about the use of slave labourers in the family&#x27;s factories during World War II. As a result, five days after the showing, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian would examine the family&#x27;s activities during Adolf Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship. The independent 1,200-page study researched and compiled by Bonn historian, Joachim Scholtyseck, that was released in 2011 concluded: &quot;The Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis&quot;. , no compensation, apology or even memorial at the site of one of their factories, have been permitted. BMW was not implicated in the report.

== Personal life ==
Police prevented an attempt to kidnap her and her mother Johanna Quandt in 1978.

Susanne met Jan Klatten while she was doing an internship with BMW in Regensburg, where he worked as an engineer. It is reported that during this time, she called herself Kant and did not tell him who she was until they were sure about each other, but Klatten himself denies the story. They married in 1990 in Kitzbühel and live in Munich. They have three children. The couple separated in 2018. She has been a member of the University Council of the Technical University of Munich since 2005. In 2007 she was awarded the &quot;Bayerischer Verdienstorden&quot;, the Bavarian Order of Merit. She is one of the biggest donors of the centre-right political party, the Christian Democratic Union.

In 2007, Klatten was blackmailed by Helg &quot;Russak&quot; Sgarbi, a 44-year-old Swiss national who threatened to release reported evidence depicting the two having an affair. Sgarbi, who was charged with similar blackmail schemes against multiple women, was arrested in January 2009 and brought to court in Germany, where he was sentenced to six years in jail. His accomplice, Italian hotel owner Ernano Barretta, had allegedly filmed Sgarbi and Klatten with hidden cameras. Barretta was also arrested and was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2012.

<doc id="1318612" wikidata="Q1042462" url="?curid=1318612" title="Space Opera (role-playing game)">
<text>Space Opera is a science-fiction role-playing game created by Edward E. Simbalist, A. Mark Ratner, and Phil McGregor in 1980 for Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU). While the game&#x27;s system can be used to create any science fiction genre, &quot;Space Opera&quot; has a default setting focused on creating space opera themed adventures.

==Development==
According to the Scott Bizar, the founder of FGU, &quot;I wanted a SF rpg and I gave the job to Ed Simbalist. During the process I’ve never met Ed, nor Phil McGregor and Mark Ratner, who lived in the Canadian west, Australia and the east of the USA, respectively. The project was completed over more than two years entirely by correspondence.&quot; Simbalist was responsible for all the editing and coordination. Phil McGregor sent some technology and space ship related stuff which Simbalist liked so much that he incorporated it in the finished product. While the background universe was based on Mark Ratner&#x27;s &quot;Space Marines&quot;, Ratner had little input into &quot;Space Opera&quot; itself. 

Part of the Volume One introduction by Bizar describes this undertaking:

==Character creation==
Character creation in &quot;Space Opera&quot; takes about an hour to generate an experienced and in-depth character. The number of random rolls is limited, but the player has discretion in how points are applied and many choices among skills.

Players choose from the following classes: Armsman, Astronaut, Tech (with subclasses such as Armstech or Crimetech), and Scientist (Pure Researcher, Medical Researcher, Physician, &amp; Engineering subclasses). The classes enable bonuses to be applied to personal characteristics and can ease the cost to acquire skills.

&quot;Space Opera&quot; characters&#x27; personal characteristics average out higher than the average person. Players roll a d100 for each of the 14 characteristics. These are Physique, Strength, Constitution, Agility, Dexterity, Empathy, Intelligence, Psionics, Intuition, Bravery, Leadership, General Technical Aptitude (GTA), Mechanical Aptitude, and Electronics Aptitude. Bonus points based on class can be applied to these rolls. Players compare the final number with a scaled table resulting in a number between 1 and 19 for each characteristic. Players make Characteristic Rolls (CRs) on a d20 during play.

Planet of Birth is made up of three rolls for Gravity, Atmosphere, and Climate. These can affect on Personal Characteristics choice of race.

Player characters can belong to any of the following races: Human, Humanoid, Transhuman, Pithecine, Canine, Feline, Ursoid, Avian, and Warm-blooded Saurian. Some of the races have characteristic prerequisites.

Other capabilities, such as Carrying Capacity, Damage Factor, and Stamina (based on Personal Characteristics) help to further define the character.

In the Career path the character goes through the recruitment process, participates for a random number of tours-of-duty, has opportunities for promotion, and finally musters out, in some cases with severance pay, pension benefits, savings, and personal gear. 

Finally, the player calculates the number of skill points available, chooses skills, and allocates points to those skills. 

==Races==
&quot;Space Opera&quot; races are treated generally. Instead of assigning a unique name to a race, the game names them anthropomorphically. This allows any fictional race to be simulated.

Player character races: 
*Avian: Anthropomorphic bird races.
*Canine: Anthropomorphic canine races. 
*Feline: Anthropomorphic felines come in two general strains: Mekpurr, the smaller and more technically adept and Avatar, larger, hunting cat varieties. Example: Kzinti
*Humans: These include current Earth homo sapiens as well as all well-known biologically similar Science Fiction races. Example: Fremen 
*Humanoids: Representative of human races who evolved away from the basic racial stock due to evolutionary adaptations to the local environment, and are generally not genetically compatible with Humans. Arrangement and even functions of internal organs differ. They may have adaptive extra organs, such as Desert planet humanoid&#x27;s nictitating membranes and Olfactory organs more sensitive (similar to sharks and blood) to water. 
*Pithecine: Anthropomorphic primate races resembling gorillas and the like, tending to be more emotional and more easily excited. Example: Planet of the Apes
*Saurian: Anthropomorphic warm-blooded dinosaur races. They are a &quot;cold blooded&quot; group only empathically speaking, by human standards, with loyalty to race over family. Example: Gorn 
*Transhumans: Any kind of humanoid race which has achieved a greater level of evolution than Humans/Humanoids, more intellectually oriented, and with higher psionic aptitudes. Example: Vulcan
*Ursoids / Blarad: Anthropomorphic bear races. Example: Wookiee
*IRSOL: Technically not a separate race, but any of the above races having fragile, taller and thinner frames for having evolved on low gravity managed atmosphere orbital installations, such as space stations, dome cities on asteroids, or wandering &quot;StarCities.&quot;

Non-player character races: 
&quot;Space Opera&quot; also includes a list of races for Non-player Characters and for encounters that consist of some meaningful contact: 
*Amoeboids
*Avian/Whistler
*Canine/Rauwoof
*Cold planet beings
*Feline/Avatar
*Feline/MekPurr
*Human
*Humanoid
*Icthyoid/Klackon
*Icthyoid/Mertun
*Insectoid/Arachnoid
*Insectoid/Bug
*Insectoid/Scorpionoid
*Insectoid/Zzz&#x27;Kkk
*IRSOL
*Pithecine
*Saurian/Hiss
*Silicates
*Transhuman
*Ursoid/Blarad
==Planet of birth==
Characters can be born on a planet with any Gravity Field ranging from zero G to 2.5 G. Characters can also be born on a planet with many atmosphere types, ranging from low or no atmosphere in dome cities, to very high pressure atmospheres, with or without some contaminants, or partially exotic constituents. Finally, characters can be born on a planet with many Climate types:
*Type 1 Standard Terran Planet
*Type 1 Steppe Planet
*Type 1 Arid Planet
*Type 1 Desert Planet
*Type 1 Swamp Planet
*Type 1 Jungle Planet
*Type 1 Tundra Planet
*Type 1 Ocean Planet
*Type 2 Terran Planet without seasonality
*Type 3 Terran Planet with extreme seasonality
*Type 4 Terran Planet with normal axial tilt at outer edge of stellar ecosphere
*Type 5 Terran Planet with minimal axial tilt at outer edge of stellar ecosphere
*Type 6 Terran Planet with extreme axial tilt at outer edge of stellar ecosphere
*Type 7 Terran Planet with normal axial tilt at inner edge of stellar ecosphere
*Type 8 Terran Planet with minimal axial tilt at inner edge of stellar ecosphere
*Type 9 Terran Planet with extreme axial tilt at inner edge of stellar ecosphere
*Type 10 Terran Planet with eccentric orbit crossing beyond the outer ecosphere
*Type 11 Terran Planet with eccentric orbit crossing beyond the inner ecosphere
*Type 12 Terran Planet with eccentric orbit crossing beyond the inner ecosphere &amp; the outer ecosphere
*Type 13 Terran Planet up to 10% beyond inner ecosphere limit (13/7, 13/8, 13/9) 
*Type 14 Terran Planet up to 30% outside stellar ecosphere (14/4, 14/5, 14/6)
*Type 13 Airless/Low pressure, managed domed environment, with moon-like extremes of temperature 
*Type 14 Airless/Low pressure, managed domed environment, cold exotic atmosphere 
*Type 15 Airless/Low pressure, managed domed environment, close to primary with high radiation
*Type 15 High pressure, managed domed environment, high surface temperatures 
*Type 16 Far out from primary, noontime high temperatures -80 °C to -185 °C 
*Type 17 Far out from primary, noontime high temperatures -185 °C to -225 °C
*Type 18 Far out from primary, noontime high temperatures -225 °C to -273 °C
*Type 19 Rogue planet, completely frozen
*Type 20 Gas Giants with orbital positions indicated as 20/15, 20/16, 20/17, 20/18, 20/19

Where not noted normal (10° to 30°) axial tilts are assumed, extreme minimums with the suffix -A, extreme maximums with the suffix -B, with the exception of Type 2 and Type 3 which are axial tilt categories.

==Psionics==
Some characters are able to use Psionics, an advanced science with multiple fields of studies, three levels of functioning (Psionically dead, Psionically open, Psionically Awakened), and multiple skills. Characters who are open and Psionically attacked or have contact with a raw PK Crystal can awaken and learn skills by trial and error. Characters with high Psionic scores might be &quot;contacted&quot; and trained. Psionic fields include: 
*Telepathy - 29 skills 
*Telekinesis - 25 skills 
*Teleportation - 4 skill 
*Clairvoyance - 15 skills
*Telurgy &amp; Self-awareness - 12 skills
*The Force - 11 skills

==Technology==
&quot;Space Opera&quot; technology mirrors the technology in stories traditional to that genre. Missing are the influences of cyberpunk, mechs, and nanotechnology, which all came later than the publication of the game.

Multi-Computers (500 kg - 50 tons) are based on a monolithic, mainframe-style that are meant to look after a least as many processes as the human brain takes care of for the human body, but for starships or cities. &quot;Space Opera&quot; also includes Mini-Computers at higher tech levels that are comparable to today&#x27;s smartphones. A variety of software for computers is available covering &quot;much of the significant knowledge of the race.&quot; The higher level Multi-comps (Mk.X to Mk.XIV) are considered sentient with &quot;cybernetic rights.&quot;

Many other innovative sci-fi technologies are included, for example: Artificial Gills, Still Suits, medical and anti-aging drugs, Electro-Binoculars (1000 Lightyears range), ECM for communication and sensorscans, belt-size personal force-screen generators, power assisted personal armor, grav/jump belts, robots of every type, laser/blaster guns, laserswords &amp; lightswords, anti-robot positronic brain disruptors (APROBDIF), etc.

==Combat system==
Combat is generally a four-step process. One first determines if a character scores a hit with his chosen weapon. Things like range, size of the target, movement, and amount of cover come into play. If one scores a hit, then one rolls to determine hit location. After hit location, one then determines if the attack penetrated the armor. Finally, damage is determined.
The full range of possible weapons technologies is covered, from the lowest tech level &quot;Atlatl,&quot; to the high tech &quot;Anti-Robot Positronic Brain Disruptor (APROBDIF)&quot; guns and screens.

==Official universe==

While the &quot;Space Opera&quot; rules can be adapted to any imagined universe, the official universe was based on the nations described in Mark Ratner&#x27;s &quot;Space Marines&quot;, and further defined through a series of Star Sector Atlases.

==Books==
The &quot;Space Opera&quot; core game consisted of two volumes and four double-sided 8x11&quot; data sheets, in a box. There were three different box covers 
probably corresponding to three printings, and the two core books were merged into one binding in the last printing, but the contents remained the same throughout.

The supplements &quot;Denoba Class Small Merchant&quot; and &quot;Nike Class Patrol Cruiser&quot; were written by Edward E. Simbalist, Robert N. Charrette, and S. R. Greene and published in 1988 by Seeker Gaming Systems.

==Reprints==
Some components of &quot;Space Opera&quot; are in print again after a long absence and are available via FGU&#x27;s online store and the RPG download sites DriveThruRPG and RPGNow.

The rights to the game are jointly held by the authors and Fantasy Games Unlimited, whereas the rights to the title were probably held by FGU solely. The rights to the game were to revert to the authors if the company went out of business. Despite going into dormant periods operating as a company in name only, FGU is still in operation. Ed Simbalist sought to buy the rights from the publisher Scott Bizar, however Bizar&#x27;s asking price was judged too high.

From a December 2000 interview with Ed Simbalist:
 Reportedly the asking price was $100,000, though the authors felt it was only worth $10,000.

==New publications==
Three new Star Sector Atlases, #4 and #7, and #6 were published in 2014, 2016, and 2018.

==Reception==
Stefan Jones reviewed &quot;Space Opera&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 33. Jones commented that &quot;Despite its flaws, I highly recommend &quot;Space Opera&quot;. This game has the best of the other major SFRPGs on the market and more.&quot;

Eric Goldberg reviewed &quot;Space Opera&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #5 and commented that &quot;If only the attention to science fiction in &quot;Space Opera&quot; could be combined with the smoothness of the &quot;Traveller&quot; game, sf role-players would not need to look any further.&quot;

Andy Slack reviewed &quot;Space Opera&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #25, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that &quot;this is an extremely complicated game which will take a very long time to set up properly. It is also unusual for such a detailed game to be &#x27;heroic&#x27; rather than &#x27;realistic&#x27;. Nonetheless, for someone prepared to spend the time required to do it justice, this could be a rewarding and entertaining game.&quot;

William A. Barton reviewed &quot;Space Opera&quot;, 2nd Ed. in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 49. Barton commented that &quot;for those who liked &quot;Space Opera&quot; originally or for those who thought it had potential but were turned off by the typos, omissions, etc., the 2nd edition is definitely worth having.&quot;

In Issue 8 of the French games magazine &quot;Casus Belli&quot;, Thierry Marin compared this game to the complex and formula-heavy fantasy game &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;, calling &quot;Space Opera&quot; &quot;currently the most complete science fiction role-playing game ever published.&quot; Marin noted that this complexity especially was felt during space combat, and recommended that both the gamemaster and the players each have a calculator. Marin concluded with a positive recommendation, saying, &quot;&quot;Space Opera&quot; is a very complete SF role-playing game; and the simulation is very good. On the other hand, people who fear complicated and sometimes very complex rules may be somewhat put off... but the game is worth it!&quot; 

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this game &quot;an unforgiving game system that ... tests a player&#x27;s tolerance for tables, charts, and formulas ... Though the system produces well-rounded PCs, it&#x27;s painfully convoluted, a problem that plagues &quot;Space Opera&quot; throughout. The rules for starship design require a background in physics to appreciate, and the combat rules rival the detail of tactical wargames.&quot; Swan found that this complexity and attention to detail brought the game to a snail&#x27;s pace. &quot;Every part of the game&#x27;s mechanics is based on complicated routines — a simple scenario can take a weekend to complete.&quot; Swan also found that the complex game rules had been overtaken by newer and simpler games, commenting, &quot;The rules are workable, but they&#x27;re also dated and dry, especially in light of such streamlined, action-intensive games as &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.&quot; Swan concluded by giving this game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;For players with time on their hands who consider &quot;Star Trek&quot; too childish and &quot;Star Wars&quot; too simple-minded, &quot;Space Opera&quot; might be worth a look.&quot;

<doc id="1318622" wikidata="Q2204566" url="?curid=1318622" title="Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr.">
<text>Samuel Irving &quot;S.I.&quot; Newhouse Jr. (November 8, 1927 – October 1, 2017) was an American heir to a substantial magazine and media business. Together with his brother Donald, he owned Advance Publications, founded by their late father in 1922, whose properties include Condé Nast (publisher of such magazines as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;), dozens of newspapers across the United States (including &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, and &quot;The Oregonian&quot;), former cable company Bright House Networks, and a controlling stake in Discovery Communications.

==Early life==
He was the son of Mitzi (née Epstein) and Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., the founder of Advance Publications. Sam Newhouse Sr. had been the young editor of the &quot;Bayonne Times&quot; and when he asked the owner of the Times for a raise he had long deserved, he was refused. Sam then quit the Times to become associated with the Staten Island paper that formed the basis of his publication future, The Staten Island Advance and Advance Publications, respectively. Newhouse attended the Horace Mann School in New York City. He later attended Syracuse University, but dropped out and began working at his father&#x27;s newspapers. The S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University is named for him.

==Career==
After dropping out of Syracuse University, Newhouse worked for the International News Service in Paris. He served two years in the U.S. Air Force before going to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to oversee two of his father&#x27;s daily newspapers. In 1964, he became publisher of the U.S. edition of Vogue and in 1975, he took over as chairman of Condé Nast. In 1985, he purchased the New Yorker.

Prior to his death, he had an estimated net worth of $9.5 billion, and he was ranked the 46th richest American by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2014.

Newhouse gave money to charity, including $15 million to Syracuse University in 1962. He was also an art collector, who at one time owned one of the most valuable paintings in the world, a Jackson Pollock drip painting, &quot;No. 5, 1948&quot;. Newhouse was listed by &quot;Art News&quot; as among the top 200 art collectors in the world.

==Personal life and death==
Newhouse was Jewish. He was married to Jane Franke in 1951 and they had three children together: Samuel I. Newhouse III, Wynn Newhouse (1954-2010), and Pamela Newhouse Mensch. The Wynn Newhouse Awards, an annual award program that provides grants to artists with disabilities, was established in 2006.

In 1959 a divorce between Franke and Newhouse was finalized, to much disapproval from his parents. In 1973, Newhouse married Victoria Carrington Benedict de Ramel. 

Newhouse&#x27;s grandson, Samuel I. Newhouse IV, appeared in the documentary &quot;Born Rich&quot;.

Newhouse died on October 1, 2017, at the age of 89.

<text>Quinn Scott Allman (born January 18, 1982) is an American musician, best known as the guitarist, backing vocalist, and a founding member of the rock band The Used.

==Biography==

Allman grew up in Springville, Utah, and later moved to Pleasant Grove, Utah. He has an older sister and two younger brothers. He grew up watching his father play in numerous bands as a drummer, originally picking up the drums at age five.
Allman picked up the guitar at age 14 and started playing in bands at 15. Allman is influenced by bands such as Face to Face, Goldfinger, Thursday, Kenna, Weezer, Jimmy Eat World and The New Transit Direction.

== Career ==
In 1999, Allman formed the band Dumb Luck with Jeph Howard, Branden Steineckert, and Ashton Johnson. They released one EP in 2000 titled &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;. Later in 2000, Allman formed The Used with Jeph Howard and Branden Steineckert, vocalist Bert McCracken joined in January 2001.

Allman went on to release six studio albums, two EPs, and multiple live compilation albums with The Used, contributing as a lead guitarist, writer, creative director, and background vocalist. Additionally, he played a key role in creating four album documentaries for the band.

On February 2, 2015, The Used announced that Allman would be taking a year long hiatus from the band. Justin Shekoski of Saosin temporarily replaced Allman on subsequent tours. However, on November 19, 2015, The Used released a statement saying that they were moving forward without Allman as a &quot;result of a mutual understanding&quot;. However, former bandmate Branden Steineckert, who had left the band nine years prior, hosted Allman on the final episode of his podcast 801PUNX. In the podcast, Allman explains he was actually not allowed to return to the band and was kicked out.

In 2017, Allman sued McCracken, Howard, and The Used LLC for touring, album, and merchandise proceeds that occurred before his dismissal from the band, as well as damages for late and irregular royalty payments due to him. The case was settled out of court in 2020.

Following his departure from The Used, Allman collaborated with many artists such as Mikey Way, Andy Biersack, Patrick Stump, Anthony Green, and John Feldmann.

In 2016, Allman formed his collaborative electronic indie project VadaWave with his wife, Megan Joy. Together they have released one EP, six singles, and five acoustic recordings. They frequently perform and have performed at large music festivals such as LOVELOUD.

Allman had performed as the guitarist with the alternative music project Bloody Cabaret.

In June 2024, Allman posted a message via Instagram saying that he had been subject to years of abuse by someone involved in his musical career, although his alleged abuser was not named.

On August 19, 2024, Allman released &quot;I Digress,&quot; the first single from his EP of the same name, in which he performs vocals and guitar, as well as writes the lyrics. &quot;Porcelain&quot;, the second single from the EP, was released on October 21, 2024.

On October 9, 2024, Allman announced on his Instagram that his biography, &quot;A Book Full of Sharp Objects,&quot; will be released at the end of 2024 following a Kickstarter campaign.

== Personal life ==
Allman married American Idol singer Megan Joy in 2011. Together they have two sons: one from Megan&#x27;s previous marriage and one born in 2016.

The Used&#x27;s singer, Bert McCracken, describes Allman as a &quot;truly spiritual and warm&quot; individual. Even following their fallout, McCracken still states that, &quot;No one plays guitar like Quinn&quot;.

<doc id="1318640" wikidata="Q373705" url="?curid=1318640" title="Ilhéus">
<text>Ilhéus () is a major city located in the southern coastal region of Bahia, Brazil, 211 km south of Salvador, the state&#x27;s capital. The city was founded in 1534 as Vila de São Jorge dos Ilhéus and is known as one of the most important tourism centers of the northeast of Brazil.

==Geography==
As of 2020 Ilhéus had approximately 159,923 inhabitants, with an area of 1850 km sq, and its downtown is located 1 km away from the Atlantic Ocean. 

===Climate===

Ilhéus has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;).
===Conservation===

The municipality contains a small part of the Una Wildlife Refuge, which surrounds the Una Biological Reserve in the neighboring municipality of Una.
It contains 15% of the Serra do Conduru State Park, created in 1997.
It contains part of the Lagoa Encantada e Rio Almada Environmental Protection Area, created in 1993.
The APA is threatened by water pollution from sewage and garbage, since most of the communities have no sanitation. There are irregular settlements of squatters in the coastal area. Other threats include irregular fishing, deforestation, fires, hunting and the illegal trade in wild animals.

==Economy==

The city was once one of the biggest exporters of cocoa beans.

The city&#x27;s economy is based mainly on tourism, as a result of its beaches and cultural heritage that includes early Portuguese buildings, history and culinary distinctions, which bring to the city many Brazilian and foreign tourists.

== Urban infrastructure==
There is a proposal for the construction of a new deep water port which due to impact has been opposed by environmental activists but has been accepted by the government as important for the economy.

==Transportation==
* Road: BR-101 connects it to Itabuna and beyond.
* Air: Ilhéus Jorge Amado Airport with daily flights of Azul Brazilian Airlines, GOL and LATAM Brasil
with destinations Belo Horizonte-Confins (CNF), Campinas (VCP), Salvador (SSA), São Paulo-Congonhas (CGH) and São Paulo-Guarulhos (GRU).
* Sea: Port of Ilhéus.

==Culture==

Ilhéus is the hometown of Jorge Amado, the best known writer in Brazil. He wrote over 25 novels, which were translated into 48 languages and stayed on bestseller lists in 52 countries. His novels like &quot;Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon&quot; and &quot;Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands&quot; portray life and customs in the Northeastern region of Brazil. The plots of these and his other major works largely treat the lives of poor urban and rural black and mulatto communities of Bahia, as well as the land wars that raged in Ilhéus, where cocoa barons killed each other for power and cocoa plantations.

<text>Robert Alan Pritzker (June 30, 1926 – October 27, 2011) was an American businessman and member of the wealthy Pritzker family.

==Biography==
Pritzker was born to a Jewish family, the Pritzker family, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Fanny (née Doppelt) and A.N. Pritzker. He has two brothers: Donald Pritzker and Jay Pritzker. Robert Pritzker received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1946 and an honorary doctorate in 1984. He taught night courses at IIT and began serving on the board of trustees in 1962, and served as a University Regent until the time of his death. He also taught evening classes at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business (now the Booth School of Business) in the late 1970s and through the 1980s. His class consisted of cases developed from actual business take-overs he was involved with, and students had to recommend whether or not to purchase the companies under study. Pritzker started The Marmon Group, an international association of autonomous manufacturing and service companies. Marmon&#x27;s assets constitute half of the Pritzker family fortune. Robert&#x27;s success can be partially attributed to his unique business structure, in which employees are trusted to make more key decisions, independent of the central office, than in other typical manufacturing settings. This independence allows for more creativity, and increases speed and productivity. Concurrently, Pritzker spent a year as Chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers.

In 2002, Bob Pritzker retired from his position of President of The Marmon Group and assumed the role of President of Colson Associates, Inc., a holding company of caster, plastics moldling, hardware and medical companies, including Acumed, OsteoMed, and Precision Edge Surgical Products Company, among others.

==Personal life==
Pritzker was married three times:
* His first wife was Audrey Frances Gilbert, whom he married on December 19, 1948 and divorced in 1979. In 1981, she married again to Albert B. Ratner, the co-chairman of Cleveland-based real estate developer Forest City Enterprises. Pritzker and Gilbert had three children: 
** Jennifer N. Pritzker (b. James, 1950) – retired Lt Colonel in the U.S. Army and founder of the Pritzker Military Library. Jennifer has three children: daughter Tal Hava Pritzker and sons Andrew and William.
** Linda Pritzker (b. 1953) – psychotherapist and ordained Tibetan Buddhist lama.
** Karen Pritzker Vlock (b. 1958) – married to investor Michael Vlock.
* In 1980, he married Australian Irene Dryburgh, whom he met while she worked at a Hyatt hotel in Australia. Prior to their divorce in 1989, they had two children: 
** Matthew Pritzker (b. 1982) – is a real-estate entrepreneur, the head of the Matthew Pritzker Company, former owner of Chicago-based HomeMade Pizza Company, and State Street Pictures.
** Liesel Pritzker Simmons (b. 1984) – a child actress who starred in &quot;A Little Princess&quot; and played the U.S. President&#x27;s daughter in the film Air Force One. She co-founded with her mother the IDP Foundation, dedicated to &quot;developing innovative, scalable and replicable programs through sustainable initiatives that move away from aid based models and lead to greater progress in the achievement of Education for All for the most deprived.&quot;
* His third wife, whom he married in 1994, was Sao Mayari Sargent, the daughter of the Austrian author Inge Sargent (née Eberhard), and her first husband Sao Kya Seng, last Saopha of Hsipaw State in Shan State, Burma.

Robert Pritzker preferred to fly coach despite having access to a family-owned corporate jet: &quot;If I ask my managers to go coach how can I go first class? That&#x27;s leadership.&quot;

Pritzker received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1983.

Pritzker&#x27;s nephew and namesake, J. B., was elected Governor of Illinois in 2018.

<text>Coastal-class ferries, also known as the &quot;Super-C class&quot; are three ferries owned and operated by BC Ferries of British Columbia, Canada and were built at the Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard in Flensburg, Germany. They are the second-largest ships in the BC Ferries fleet, surpassed only by the two larger, single-ended Spirit-class ferries. At the time of their building, the three ships were the largest double-ended ferries in the world, however the record has since been surpassed.

The three ferries (, , and ) were ordered by BC Ferries to replace the aging V-class ferries. They operate on two of the busiest routes connecting the Lower Mainland to Vancouver Island—Tsawwassen↔Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen↔Duke Point. In the past, they have also served the Horseshoe Bay↔Departure Bay route, but have since been reassigned.

==Description==
The Coastal class of ferries is composed of three ships, &quot;Coastal Renaissance&quot;, &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot; and &quot;Coastal Celebration&quot;. At launch they were the largest double-ended ferries in the world. The three ships are long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . They have a maximum draught of . All three vessels have the same maximum displacement of , but have varying tonnages; &quot;Coastal Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Coastal Celebration&quot; have a gross tonnage (GT) of 21,777 and &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot;, a GT of 21,980. &quot;Coastal Renaissance&quot; has a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 2,366, &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot;, a DWT of 1,770 and &quot;Coastal Celebration&quot;, a DWT of 2,350.

The ships are powered by four 8-cylinder MaK 8M32C diesel engines driving two electric motors turning two controllable pitch propellers. The engines are split into two main compartments and each compartment can run independently. The engines are rated at . The ferries have a maximum speed of and a cruising speed of . The vessel has seven decks, with the passenger deck on Deck 6, above the two bridges on Deck 5, with additional passenger spaces between the two bridges on Deck 5. The class has a capacity of 1,604 passengers and crew and lane space for 310 full-sized family vehicles. Initial reports stated the vessels could carry 1,650 passengers and crew and 370 cars. Amenities aboard each ferry include a Coastal Cafe, a Coast Cafe Express, Sitka Coffee Place, lounge, gift shop, and children&#x27;s and pet areas.

==Ships in class==
==Acquisition and service==

The vessels were ordered from Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard in Flensburg, Germany in September 2004 for €206.4 million. According to BC Ferries at this time, this was 40 percent lower than the lowest Canadian shipyard&#x27;s bid. This was a controversial decision, which led to Canadian shipbuilders protesting the decision. The first new Coastal-class vessel, &quot;Coastal Renaissance&quot;, departed for British Columbia on October 27, 2007, and arrived on December 13, 2007. She entered service on the Departure Bay to Horseshoe Bay run on March 8, 2008. She was followed by &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot;, which left Germany on February 9 and arrived March 25, and &quot;Coastal Celebration&quot;, which departed on May 9 and arrived on June 18. The vessels&#x27; names were based on submissions received during a &quot;naming contest&quot; in late 2005.

&quot;Coastal&quot; &quot;Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot; operate on the Duke Point to Tsawwassen route. &quot;Coastal Celebration&quot; serves the Swartz Bay to Tsawwassen route. &quot;Coastal Renaissance&quot; at one time operated from Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay, but has been reassigned.

On December 20, 2011, &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot; collided with the terminal at Duke Point while travelling at , damaging the lower vehicle ramp at the terminal and causing damage to the vessel. 16 were injured in the collision and the bow door, the starboard side shell, and the rubbing plate on the ship were damaged. &quot;Coastal Inspiration&quot; was then redirected to the Departure Bay terminal with the assistance of a tugboat to disembark passengers and vehicles. The ship was out of service for 122 days. The cause of the crash was later found to be crew error.

In August 2023, &quot;Coastal Renaissance&quot; suffered an issue with her drive motor, and the vessel was removed from service for extensive repairs. The vessel&#x27;s return to service was delayed at least twice. Repairs are estimated to have cost approximately $3 million. She returned to service on March 4, 2024, after being out of service for just under seven months.

<text>, also called Prétear - The New Legend of Snow White, is a manga series written by Junichi Sato and illustrated by Kaori Naruse. Spanning four volumes, the manga series was originally published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten from May 2000 to July 2001, and published in English in North America by ADV Manga.

The series was adapted into a thirteen episode anime series by Hal Film Maker, Kadokawa Shoten, and Rondo Robe, and aired in Japan on WOWOW from April 4, 2001 to June 27, 2001. Geneon, now NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan, released the series&#x27; episodes across four volumes in Japan on both VHS and DVD, with ADV Films licensing and releasing it.

==Plot==
High school student Himeno Awayuki is trying to adjust to her new life after her widowed father remarries the wealthy widow Natsue. While taking a shortcut to school, she encounters Hayate, the Knight of Wind, and gets into an argument with him; she attempts to punch him, but he blocks her hand, causing a powerful light to appear. She later meets the other Leafe Knights, who tell her that the red snow that has been recently falling in town is caused by the Princess of Disaster, who is awakening and using demon larva to absorb Leafe, the essence of all life. They ask Himeno to become the Prétear and help them protect the world, but she is initially reluctant, believing they are trying to play a trick on her. However, when a larva attacks them and begins to steal Leafe, she agrees to help and merges with Hayate to become the Wind Prétear. After adjusting to her new powers, she is able to defeat the larva.

As the series progresses, Himeno falls in love with Hayate, who is initially distant and refuses to acknowledge her as the Prétear. Eventually, she learns the Princess of Disaster was once a girl named Takako, who was the previous Prétear and did not enjoy fighting. She also fell in love with Hayate, and when he could not return her feelings, her anguish caused her powers to turn to evil, turning her into the Princess of Disaster.

Mawata, one of Himeno&#x27;s stepsisters, who has been overwhelmed with grief since her father&#x27;s death and has distanced herself from her family, temporarily bonds with Himeno over their shared feelings, but is hurt when she sees Himeno with Hayate. Mawata is in love with Sasame, but when it is revealed that he is in love with Takako, he leaves his position as a Leafe Knight and joins her to become her Knight of Darkness. Takako uses Mawata&#x27;s love for Sasame to hurt her so that she can use her to fuel the Great Tree of Fenrir.

As the city is overrun by the Great Tree, Himeno reveals her status and powers as the Prétear to her family and begs them to flee while she rescues Mawata. However, they refuse to leave Mawata behind and put themselves in danger to save her. Hayate and Sasame engage in a fight to the death while Himeno climbs the Great Tree of Fenrir and Himeno&#x27;s family begins to attack the bubble holding Mawata. Himeno continues up the Tree to confront the Princess of Disaster. Mawata is freed and safe in the arms of her family, but Takako does not want her to go and desperately calls for Sasame, who appears after defeating Hayate. Fenrir asks Sasame to kill both Hayate and Himeno, but Himeno convinces him not to. Believing that not even Sasame loves her, Takako tries to kill herself, but he shields her and dies, causing her to return to her true self after realizing that she loves Sasame as well. Out of control, the Tree captures Takako and Hayate sacrifices himself to protect Himeno as she tries to save her.

To stop the Tree, Himeno becomes the legendary White Prétear and pours out a massive amount of Leafe, which restores the town, heals the Leafe Knights, and revives Sasame and Hayate. Hayate awakens to find the others crying over Himeno&#x27;s lifeless body, but she is revived after he kisses her. At the end of the series, Himeno and Hayate are a couple, Himeno and her family are closer, and Mawata and Takako and Sasame are happier.

==Characters==

===Awayuki family===
: is a sixteen-year-old girl and the protagonist of the series. After her mother&#x27;s death and her father&#x27;s remarriage, Himeno struggles to adjust to her new life in a high-class society as she is picked on both by her new family and her peers at school. As Himeno&#x27;s alienation grows, she meets Hayate and the other Leafe Knights, who tell her that she is the Prétear who must save the world. Over the course of the series, she develops feelings for Hayate and falls in love with him. She is voiced by Sayuri Yoshida in Japanese and Luci Christian in English.

: is Natsue&#x27;s eldest daughter, who is the same age as Himeno and has a pretentious attitude towards her because she comes from an impoverished family.

She is voiced by Satsuki Yukino in Japanese and by Shelley Calene-Black in English.

: is a fourteen-year-old girl who is intelligent, calm, and seemingly the perfect child of the family. However, her calm demeanor is a facade to hide her loneliness and her grief following her father&#x27;s death. Ultimately, Fenrir exploits her grief of losing her father and heartbreak over Sasame to fuel the Great Tree of Fenrir. She is voiced by Akemi Kanda in Japanese adaptation and by Mandy Clark in English.

: is Himeno&#x27;s father and a former author of romance novels, who stopped writing following the death of Himeno&#x27;s mother. Before marrying Natsue, Kaoru spent much of his time drinking sake while Himeno balanced the budget and cooked their meals. In the anime, he becomes a sculptor after marrying Natsue. He is voiced by Yuji Ueda in Japanese and Jason Douglas in English.

: is a wealthy and powerful executive who married Kaoru, who she had a crush on, after her divorce, and is kind to him but strict with others. Her daughters are named after characters in her favorite book by him, &quot;Twin Princesses&quot;. Natsue is consumed by jealousy towards Kaoru&#x27;s deceased wife and Himeno, treating her more harshly than her own daughters. Her hatred later causes her to be possessed by the Princess of Disaster. In the anime, Natsue is never possessed by the Princess of Disaster, she does not divorce her husband, who instead died, she does not show jealousy towards Kaoru&#x27;s late wife, and while she is strict with Himeno, she cares for her well being. She is voiced by Kikuko Inoue in Japanese and Lauren Goodnight in English.

===Leafe Knights===
: is the Knight of Wind. He is initially hostile towards Himeno, refusing to acknowledge her as the new Prétear due to a past experience, but gradually begins to accept her after being impressed by her will and determination. Over time, he develops feelings for Himeno and eventually falls in love with her, going so far as to protect her and get a job at her estate working for her father. He is voiced by Kousuke Toriumi in Japanese and Illich Guardiola in English.

: is the Knight of Sound. He has a job as a radio personality, where he addresses people&#x27;s problems on the air. He is said to be a flirt, as the other Knights call him a playboy, but he is also a good listener and offers himself as a sounding board to Himeno. In the manga, he remains a Leafe Knight and seemingly falls in love with Himeno. In the anime, he later becomes Fenrir&#x27;s Knight of Darkness after confessing that he was in love with Takako sixteen years ago, putting him against the Leafe Knights and the Prétear. As well, he is calmer and more serious and has an older appearance. He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai in Japanese and Chris Patton in English.

: is the Knight of Light. He works for an internet company and is the most practical and direct of the Knights, which sometimes leads to conflicts. In the anime, he is more of a narcissist, as evidenced by the numerous toys and pictures of himself in his work. He is voiced by Makoto Naruse in Japanese and Victor Carsrud in English.

: is the Knight of Fire, who works as a waiter. He is voiced by Shotaro Morikubo in Japanese and Spike Spencer in English.

: is the Knight of Ice and the unstated leader of the younger members of the Leafe Knights. Along with his followers, Hajime and Shin, he died fighting the Princess of Disaster sixteen years ago and was reborn as a child. Hs is voiced by Akiko Yajima in Japanese and Greg Ayres in English.

: is the Knight of Plants and the youngest member of the Leafe Knights. He can use his abilities to heal plants, and is sensitive to others hurting them. Along with Mannen and Hajime, Shin died sixteen years ago while fighting the Princess of Disaster and was reborn as a child. In the manga, when he fuses with Himeno, he dies due to the Prétear having to draw Leafe from a knight to fight, but is later revived. In the anime, the need for the Prétear to use a knight&#x27;s Leafe is not shown, and Shin is the only knight who is never shown fusing with her. He is also shown to have the ability to seal demon larvae and create barriers around a battle to protect the environment from harm. He is voiced by Tamaki Nakanishi in Japanese and Sasha Paysinger in English.

===Other characters===
: is the Awayuki&#x27;s butler/chauffeur. He and Natsue used to go to school together, with him harboring a crush on her while she pursued other interests. He once offered Natsue a ride, which led to him being employed as the Awayuki&#x27;s chauffeur. He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu in Japanese and Paul Sidello in English.

: is Himeno&#x27;s friend from middle school and her schoolmate, having transferred to her school with her. In the anime, their earlier friendship is never mentioned, and it is implied that they became friends at school after Yayoi ignored bullies telling her to stay away from Himeno. Her personality is also changed into that of a hopeless romantic who spins outrageous scenarios about the pursuit of love. She is voiced by Yukari Tamura in Japanese and Monica Rial in English.

: , whose real name is , is the main antagonist of the series. She was the previous Prétear before Himeno and fell in love with Hayate, but he was unable to reciprocate her feelings, causing her to turn her powers towards evil. As Fenrir, Takako&#x27;s goal is to destroy the world by taking away the Leafe that preserves all life. In the anime, Sasame confesses that he had loved her and, although she does not return his feelings, she has him become her Knight of Darkness and orders him to kill Hayate and attack the other Leafe Knights. At the end of the series, after Sasame&#x27;s death, Takako&#x27;s realization that he loved her along with Himeno&#x27;s kindness allow her to regain her humanity and return to normal. She is last seen with the revived Sasame, with them having become a couple. Takako also assumes the form of a maid at the Awayuki estate named who is friendly with Himeno and company and provides advice to Himeno and Mawata. She is voiced by Yui Horie in Japanese and Kaytha Coker in English.

==Production==
Anime director Junichi Satou created &quot;Prétear&quot; out of his desire to work on a series for women that featured good-looking boys. Wanting to base the story on a fairy tale, he asked himself what &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; would be like if the dwarfs were replaced with cute guys. As the story took shape, Leafe became the symbol of the apple in the story, as it pass on its life force to others, like a regular apple when eaten, or take away life, as the poison apple did in the original story. Feeling that the concept of a woman being rescued by &quot;Prince Charming&quot; was old-fashioned and not fitting with modern girls, he decided to make &quot;Prétear&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&quot;, Himeno, a more assertive woman.

Though an anime director himself, Satou did not direct the anime adaptation of &quot;Prétear&quot;. Kiyoko Sayama directed the series, while Satou provided consultation and checked the scripts and storyboards before they were animated. The anime characters were designed by Akemi Kobayashi, who made changes to the characters for the new story. For example, Hayate&#x27;s anime version has longer hair tied in a ponytail, while in the manga, Hayate had cut off his longer hair before the start. The design of Kei is the most drastically changed in the adaptation, with the anime version bearing little resemblance to the original.

<text>Rudolf August Oetker (20 September 1916 – 16 January 2007) colloquially also R.A. Oetker was a German industrialist, businessman, ship owner and philanthropist. Most notably he turned Dr. Oetker, founded by his grandfather August Oetker, into a multinational food conglomerate. During World War II, Oetker was a member of the Nazi Party. 

== Early life and education ==
Oetker was born 20 September 1916 in Bielefeld, German Empire, the second child of Rudolf Oetker (1889–1916), a chemist, who fell in Verdun before his son was born, and Ida Oetker (née Meyer; 1891–1944). He had an older sister; Ursula Oetker (1915–2005).

Oetker served and volunteered in the Waffen-SS from 1941 to 1944. After his stepfather, Richard Kaselowsky, was killed in an air raid, Oetker became the president of his family-run business in 1944. The business was inherited from his grandfather, August Oetker, who invented a popular mixture of baking powder.

== Career ==
After the war, Oetker was interned in the Staumühle internment camp near Paderborn. When his SS blood group tattoo was discovered under his left armpit, he was brutally beaten by the guards. For years after the war, Oetker would need a cane to walk. Following his release in 1947, he would elevate the company to a household name in Germany today. The Oetker-Gruppe was one of the symbols of the post-World War II recovery effort in the country. In 1960s, Oetker funded Stille Hilfe, a relief organization for the SS veterans, fugitives, and convicted war criminals.

Oetker retired as executive director in 1981, turning the position over to his son August Oetker (jr.).

In 2006, his net worth was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at US$8.0 billion.

== Personal life ==
In 1939, Oetker married firstly to Marlene Ahlmann (1915–2002), originally from Cologne which also hailed from an industrial family. Her family owned &quot;Carlshütte&quot;, an iron foundry, which employed up to 3,000 people. They had one daughter;

* Rosely Oetker (born 1940), who would later serve on the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg, married to Folkart Schweizer (born 1940); three children and five grandchildren.

In 1943, he married secondly to divorcee Susanne Schuster (née Jantsch; 1922-2012), who would later marry Karl, Prinz zu Salm-Horstmar (1911–1991). They had four children;

* August Oetker (born 1944)
* Bergit Iris Ursula Oetker (born 1947), firstly married to Christoph von Luttitz, secondly to Christoph Archibald Douglas, currently Gräfin Douglas 
* Christian Oetker (born 1948)
* Richard Oetker (born 1951) 

On 8 February 1963, Oetker married Marianne (Maja) von Malaisé (born 1934), of nobility. With her he had three children;

* Alfred Oetker (born 1967)
* Carl Ferdinand Oetker (born 1972)
* Julia Oetker (born 1979)

In 2014, the Oetker business empire was valued at $12 billion, and each of his eight children inherited an equal share of 12.5%, or about $1.5 billion. After discovering Oetker&#x27;s Nazi past, his children hired a provenance researcher to investigate the origins of his art collection. They have begun returning artworks found to be stolen or looted to the heirs of their Jewish owners. In 2019 a painting by Carl Spitzweg was restituted to the heirs of Leo Bendel who had been looted and murdered by Nazis. The painting had been acquired through the Galerie Heinemann in Munich.

<doc id="1318693" wikidata="Q220030" url="?curid=1318693" title="Alfred Józef Potocki">
<text>[[Count]] Alfred Józef Potocki (, 29 July 1817 or 1822, Łańcut – 18 May 1889, Paris) was a Polish aristocrat (szlachcic), landowner, and a liberal-conservative monarchist Austrian politician and Prime Minister.

== Early life==
Count Potocki was born on 29 July 1817 (or 1822) in Łańcut into a prominent noble family of Polish origin, although a subject of the Empire of Austria, and inherited the Łańcut &quot;ordynat&quot; estates from his father. The son of Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki and Princess Józefina Maria Czartoryska. His grandfather was the writer Jan Potocki, best known for his famous novel &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;.

Alfred Józef Potocki is known for building the magnificent Potocki Palace, a grand residence in Lviv. In 1873 he co-founded the Akademia Umiejetnosci (Polish Academy of Skills) in Kraków. He ran a family distillery, which is today known as Polmos Łańcut.

== Career ==

He was a member of the National Sejm of Galicia from 1863 to 1889 and Sejm Marshal from 1875 until 1877. From 1875 to 1883 he was governor of Galicia.

In 1848 he became a member of the lower house of the Imperial Parliament (&quot;Reichsrat&quot;), the House of Deputies (&quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot;), and in 1861 the upper house, the House of Lords (&quot;Herrenhaus&quot;). He served in the Diplomatic Corps and was Minister of Agriculture of Austria from 30 December 1867 until 15 January 1870, but stepped down over his minority federalist views in the cabinet. 

He served as Austria&#x27;s prime minister from 1870 to 1871, and was one of the only two non-Germans who held this office in Austria-Hungary.
On 12 April 1870, he became the 5th Minister-President of Cisleithania and simultaneously Minister of Defence. His tenure included the repeal of the 1855 concordat. He was unsuccessful in promoting federalism and failing to obtain the cooperation of the Czechs in the Reichsrat he stepped down on 6 February 1871, ushering in a brief interregnum of conservative rule under Count Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart (February 1871 – October 1871) which was equally ineffective in implementing federalism, so that power quickly reverted to liberalism again.

==Personal life==

On 18 March 1851 in Sławuta, he married Princess Maria Klementyna Sanguszko, heiress of the prominent Sanguszko princely family. Together, they had two sons and two daughters:

* Count Roman Potocki (1852–1915), who married Princess Elżbieta Matylda Radziwiłł, eldest daughter of Prince Antoni Wilhelm Radziwiłł and Marie de Castellane.
* Countess Julia Potocka (1854–1921), who married Count Vladislaus Branicki.
* Countess Klementyna Potocka (1856–1921), who married Count Jan Leon Antoni Tyszkiewicz, son of Count Michał Tyszkiewicz.
* Count Józef Mikołaj Potocki (1862–1922), who married Princess Helena Augusta Radziwiłł, younger daughter of Prince Antoni Wilhelm Radziwiłł.

Count Potocki died on 18 May 1889 in Paris.

* Order of the Steel Crown
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Stephen
*Order of Carol I

<doc id="1318701" wikidata="Q4347926" url="?curid=1318701" title="1934 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1934 United States Senate elections were held in the middle of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s first term. The 32 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. During the Great Depression, voters strongly backed Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and his allies in the Senate, with Democrats picking up a net of nine seats, giving them a supermajority (which required 64 seats, two-thirds of the total 96 seats in 1934). Republicans later lost three more seats due to mid-term vacancies (one to Farmer-Labor and two to Democrats); however, a Democrat in Iowa died and the seat remained vacant until the next election. The Democrats entered the next election with a 70-22-2-1 majority. 

This marked the first time that an incumbent president&#x27;s party gained seats in both houses of Congress in midterm election cycles, followed by 1998 and 2002. This was also the second of three times since the ratification of the 17th Amendment that the opposition party failed to flip any Senate seats, alongside 1914 and 2022.

A number of historic figures were first elected to the Senate in 1934, including future President Truman, future Federal District Judge and Labor Secretary Schwellenbach, the first Hispanic to be elected to a full term in the US Senate, Chavez, longtime Senator and later Representative Pepper and future Supreme Court Justice Minton.

<doc id="1318707" wikidata="Q59526" url="?curid=1318707" title="Clifton (comics)">
<text>Clifton is a Franco-Belgian comics series in the humorous spy-genre, featuring the exploits of Colonel Sir Harold Wilberforce Clifton. It was created by Raymond Macherot in 1959, and has since passed on to other artists and writers. Over the fifty years of publication of the Clifton series, approximately twenty albums and twenty smaller stories have been published, totalling about 800 pages.

==Character==
A British colonel, retired from MI5, though sometimes still active for the British government, Clifton functions as an amateur sleuth, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip, although the pressure involved frequently makes him lose his cool. Harold Clifton lives in Puddington, near London, supported by housekeeper Miss Partridge, who makes a prize-winning goulash. Clifton drives a red MG TD from the early fifties, which gets mangled in most stories, but is repaired regardless of cost. Clifton&#x27;s hobbies include Boy Scouting (he&#x27;s Boy Scoutmaster Singing Heron), cats, and collecting cigar wraps. In &quot;Passé Composé&quot; it was established that Clifton served in the RAF as a group captain during World War II before joining the Secret Service. He also ascended to knighthood in the issue &quot;Mortelle Saison&quot; for saving a member of the Royal family.

Clifton&#x27;s amateur sleuthing leads him to investigate many cases, often with the police or MI5. His main contact at MI5 is Colonel Donald Spruce who often calls on him to deal with delicate missions. Spruce is the sort of man who would be perfectly capable of handling the missions himself if not for a leg injury which has left him partly disabled.

==Publication history==

It was originally Raymond Macherot who created the Colonel Clifton character, and the first story was published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot; on 16 December 1959. In preliminary studies, Macherot had used Colonel Horatio Amaory Crickett as a working name, but before the first story decided on Colonel Clifton instead. Clifton&#x27;s first names Harold Wilberforce were not mentioned until the second story. After three stories, published in 1959–1960, Macherot went on to do other work, and eventually left &quot;Tintin&quot; for the competitor &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, leaving behind his &quot;Tintin&quot;-owned work. &quot;Clifton&quot; was shelved for six years.
In 1969, artist Jo-El Azara and writer Greg revived the series with the short story &quot;Les lutins diaboliques&quot;. In 1972, writer Greg and new artist Turk did the story &quot;Le voleur qui rit&quot;. In 1974, artist Turk and new writer De Groot (who had collaborated on the Clifton short-story &quot;Le mystère de la voix qui court&quot; in 1970), started the story &quot;Alias Lord X&quot;, and that duo began a long-lasting collaboration on eight &quot;Clifton&quot; volumes.

In 1983, Bédu took over the artwork from Turk and worked with De Groot until the 1990s. In 1991, Bédu became responsible for both artwork and scenario with the story &quot;Le clan Mc Gregor&quot;, the last story serialised in French &quot;Tintin&quot;, and continued to work alone for the following two stories published directly to albums.

In 2003, after a long inactive period, Rodrigue collaborated with Bob de Groot who returned to write &quot;Clifton&quot; scripts, and seven volumes have been published since.

==Timeline of major stories==
:

==Publications in magazines and other media==
The cartoonists worked with original French language stories, whereas all were published simultaneously in French and Dutch, the two main Belgian languages, in the weekly magazines &quot;Tintin&quot; / &quot;Kuifje&quot; (French / Dutch edition of the same magazine), &quot;Junior&quot; (French) and &quot;Ons Volkske&quot; (Dutch), all published by Lombard Editions in Brussels. &quot;Clifton&quot; also ran in other magazines, across Europe such as the German publications &quot;Zack&quot; and &quot;YPS&quot;.

Beside French and Dutch, the stories have been translated into Finnish, Portuguese, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, English and German (where in most publications Clifton is named Percy Pickwick).

In 1984, a six minutes long &quot;Clifton&quot; theatrical animated short film was made by Belvision Studios as one of the studios&#x27; final productions in the 1980s, the film department of Lombard. The cartoon was based on the short story &quot;Un pépin pour Clifton&quot; (French) / &quot;Onder Cliftons Paraplu&quot; or &quot;Pech voor Clifton&quot; (Dutch) (Lit. &quot;Bad luck for Clifton&quot;/&quot;Under Clifton&#x27;s umbrella&quot;) by Turk and De Groot. The animation was produced by Michel Leloupe, with Anthony Hamilton voicing Clifton.

===English translations===

The series have been translated into English by Cinebook Ltd, a British publisher specializing in Franco-Belgian comics. So far, eight books have been translated.

<doc id="1318710" wikidata="Q7411201" url="?curid=1318710" title="Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr.">
<text>Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr. (March 2, 1928 – May 22, 2004) was an American businessman. He was the fourth generation of his family to lead S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., a consumer products company headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin. The son of Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr., he turned a relatively small wax company into a multibillion-dollar global household name. A philanthropist and environmentalist, Johnson led his company and community &quot;to protect this planet and leave it a better place for future generations to live,&quot; noting, &quot;A good executive, a busy executive, always has time to do some other things, especially for the good of the community.&quot;

==Early years==
Johnson grew up in Racine, Wisconsin and spent most of his life there. A graduate of the Asheville School in North Carolina, he attended Cornell University and was selected for membership in the Sphinx Head Society before his 1950 graduation with a bachelor&#x27;s in economics. He then attended the Harvard Business School, from which he graduated in 1952 with a master&#x27;s in business administration. Johnson also served in the U.S. Air Force as an intelligence officer for 2 years.

==Career==
In 1967, Johnson became chairman of S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., and turned a $171 million floor wax company into a multibillion-dollar empire of four global companies which in 2004 employed over 28,000 people and sold products in 110 countries.

Johnson&#x27;s biggest impact on the business was his role in diversification. Said Johnson, &quot;The primary objective for a corporate leader is to ensure institutional survival... To survive you have to grow. To grow you have to diversify... When a company is diversified into various fields, it is rarely seriously vulnerable to the ups and downs that ravage individual business. And if you are geographically diversified... then you have some insulation between yourself and localized political and economic trouble.&quot;

===S.C. Johnson &amp; Son===
Johnson&#x27;s great-grandfather, Samuel Curtis Johnson Sr., founded the S.C. Johnson Company in 1886 as a parquet floor manufacturing business. The company, renamed S.C. Johnson &amp; Son in 1906 when Johnson&#x27;s grandfather, Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr., became a partner, began selling wax for hardwood floors in the early 20th century as an additional service. The wax business became more lucrative than parquet floors as the company developed products for surfaces as diverse as dance floors and airplanes.

Johnson&#x27;s father, Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr., later joined the company commonly referred to as Johnson Wax and became president in 1928. Johnson joined the company in 1954 as assistant to the president and was promoted to new products director in 1955, where he spearheaded the development of the aerosol insecticide, what he called &quot;the first Johnson Wax product without wax.&quot; He went on to create the first aerosol air freshener (Glade), the first aerosol insect repellent (OFF!) and the first aerosol furniture polish (Pledge.)

In 1958, Johnson became vice president of the newly formed New Service Products Division and in 1960, he moved to London and served the company as European regional director. It was in this capacity that he noticed other American products on a store shelf in Italy and became determined to never again be late to a global market.

Before becoming elected company president, Johnson served as international vice president in 1962 and moved back to Racine in 1963 as executive vice president. In 1967, he was also elected chairman and chief executive officer. In 1972, he stepped down as president but continued in his capacities as chairman and CEO of the consumer business until 1988. In 1993, he was elected non-executive chairman of the board, a position he held until his retirement in 2000, when he became chairman emeritus of what was then known as SC Johnson – A Family Company.

===JohnsonDiversey===
Johnson further diversified his company&#x27;s offerings in 1979 when he established Worldwide Innochem, a specialty chemical business. Later known as Johnson Professional and then Johnson Polymer, the business became an independent company in 1997. In 2002, the company acquired DiverseyLever and became JohnsonDiversey, Inc., the second largest business-to-business hygiene products company in the world. The company&#x27;s motto, &quot;Clean is just the beginning,&quot; refers to Diversey&#x27;s position as a worldwide leader in the development and marketing of cleaning and hygiene solutions for commercial, institutional, and industrial facilities.

===Johnson Financial Group===
Johnson led his company into the finance industry in 1970 with the establishment of the Heritage Bank &amp; Trust (now Johnson Bank) in Racine. The company, which became the Johnson Financial Group, Inc., further expanded to include Johnson Trust, Johnson Asset Management, Johnson Insurance, Johnson Investment Services, and a number of international businesses in Europe and the Caribbean. Johnson Bank is one of the five largest privately owned community banks and Johnson Insurance is one of the top 100 insurance brokers in the United States. Johnson was the group&#x27;s Chairman of the Board at the time of his death.

===Johnson Outdoors===
Johnson&#x27;s foray into diversification for his one-time wax-only family business included expanding into the outdoors industry in 1970. That year, Johnson merged Johnson Reels with the company&#x27;s first outdoor acquisition, Minn Kota Motors, into Johnson Diversified, Inc. Johnson Diversified acquired Eureka! Tent in 1973, Scubapro and Old Town Canoe in 1974, and fourteen other businesses over the course of two decades.
Johnson Diversified became Johnson Worldwide Associates in 1977 before Johnson&#x27;s family bought out the subsidiary in 1986, and took it public with offerings in 1987 and again in 1988. In 2000, JWA was renamed Johnson Outdoors, Inc. At the time of his death, Johnson was Chairman of the Johnson Outdoors&#x27; Executive Committee and Director of the Board.

==Environmentalism==
Johnson was once described by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1993 as &quot;corporate America&#x27;s leading environmentalist.&quot; Johnson was committed to environmental causes, stating, &quot;We must make sure that we step softly on the land... Once you destroy an old growth forest, or a special plant in the Amazon, or a reef around an atoll, it&#x27;s gone forever.&quot;

===Leader of the CFC ban===
Johnson was one of the first business leaders to recognize the danger to the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a then-popular propellant in aerosol products, voluntarily banning the substance from all of S.C. Johnson&#x27;s products in 1975 to the shock and anger of many people inside the company and across the nation. 
The then-unproven scientific research led Johnson to publish a letter to the public explaining his decision. &quot;Our own company scientists confirm that as a scientific hypothesis it may be possible... We concur that the pressing need for reliable scientific investigation... We at Johnson Wax are taking this action in the interest of our customers and the public in general during a period of uncertainty and scientific inquiry.&quot;

Over the next few years, Johnson encouraged his scientists to develop the company&#x27;s many non-CFC aerosol propellants and pulled his aerosol business out of several countries in which CFCs were mandated in aerosol production. Three years after Johnson recalled and ceased production of all CFC products, the U.S. government corroborated the research of the substance&#x27;s harmful effects and unilaterally banned CFCs. Johnson was praised for his early decision.

===The World Business Council for Sustainable Development===
Johnson was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

Johnson incorporated environmentally responsible behavior into his business and believed that all businesses could be successful with the same mindset. Said Johnson of his involvement with the council, &quot;We aggressively seek out eco-efficiencies--ways of doing more with less--because it makes us more competitive when we reduce and eliminate waste and risk from our products and processes. And it saves us money. By developing products that are as safe as possible for people and the environment, we improve our market share.&quot;

The WBCSD named Johnson a member of the Order of Outstanding Contributors to Sustainable Development in 2003.

===The President&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development===
Because of Johnson&#x27;s work with the WBCSD, President Bill Clinton appointed him to the President&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development in 1993. The group advised President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore until 1999 on ways to strengthen a community by improving the local economy, helping save the environment, and promoting equal opportunities for every American.

===The fight against dirty coal===
In 2003, Johnson personally financed an in-depth, grass-roots driven campaign against Wisconsin Energy Corporation&#x27;s proposal to build three new coal plants in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, stating, &quot;I think their choice is a terrible mistake considering the health and quality of life risks that coal presents.&quot;

The campaign, organized under the moniker of RESET (Responsible Energy for Southeastern Wisconsin&#x27;s Tomorrow), consisted of print and radio ads as well as a public affairs education program. Citing that the already-existent seventeen Wisconsin coal plants produced 60% more smog-forming nitric oxide pollution and 63% more soot-producing sulfur oxide pollution than that allowed by the Clean Air Act, the group delayed but failed to derail new coal plant construction.

===The Nature Conservancy===
A long-time member of both the President&#x27;s Conservation Council of the Nature Conservancy and the National Development Council of the Nature Conservancy, Johnson and his company partnered with the Conservancy to create a reserve in the Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil, which he dedicated to the memory of his father. Johnson&#x27;s reserve, the largest private Caatinga reserve in Brazil, protects 173 species of birds, 40 species of mammals, and 140 species of plants. For his work, the Ceará (Brazil) Legislative Assembly named Johnson an honorary citizen of the State of Ceará in 2000. The following year, the Wisconsin Chapter of The Nature Conservancy elected Johnson Honorary Trustee.

==Philanthropy==
In addition to his environmental work, Johnson greatly contributed to education, better health, and greater opportunities for the people of his community and around the world. Although his financial contributions were considerable—his corporate donations were around 5% annually—Johnson preferred to become personally involved with many philanthropic organizations.
Said Johnson in 1988, &quot;For voluntarism to take hold as part of a company&#x27;s culture, there must be a key executive who sets the example by personal involvement... I spend a good twenty to thirty percent of my time, or about two days of every seven, on what I call &#x27;not-for-profit&#x27; activities... Raising money is only one part of voluntarism; indeed it is not the most important. A more important part is the devotion of time by the people who actually service the organizations and spend a good portion of their free time working at no pay.&quot;

===Mayo Clinic===
Johnson was the longest serving public member of the Mayo Foundation Board of Trustees, serving from 1967 to 1990 and acting as one-time Chairman. Mayo honored Johnson for his contributions in 1991 during the groundbreaking ceremonies of the $26-million-dollar state-of-the-art S.C. Johnson Medical Research Center on the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s campus in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 2004, the year of his death, Johnson, his family, and the S.C. Johnson Fund donated more than $12 million to the establishment of Mayo&#x27;s Samuel C. Johnson Program in the Genomics of Addiction.

Johnson reflected on his contributions to the Mayo Clinic in 1991: &quot;I&#x27;ve made a commitment to this research center because I believe in the importance of medical research; I believe in the power of science to help relieve human suffering; and I believe in putting able, curious minds to work for the betterment of mankind.&quot;

===The Smithsonian Institution===
Johnson first publicly promoted his love of the arts in 1962 with S.C. Johnson&#x27;s ART:USA, the Johnson Collection of Contemporary American Painting. One of the first corporate-sponsored touring art collections, ART:USA featured 102 paintings by living American artists and toured 18 cities around the world for two years prior to a two-and-a-half-year tour through 25 American cities, breaking attendance records around the world.

Johnson donated the collection to the Smithsonian Institution in the mid-sixties citing its value because it had &quot;reached people around the world&quot; and &quot;enhanced the company&#x27;s reputation for doing the unusual in the name of excellence.&quot;

===Cornell University and the Johnson School of Management===
Johnson served as a Trustee Emeritus and Presidential Councillor at Cornell University, his alma mater. In 1984, Johnson and his family made a $20 million endowment gift to the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management that was named after Johnson&#x27;s great-grandfather, who founded Johnson Wax. In 1989, Johnson was named to the Johnson School of Management Hall of Honor in recognition of his advisory council leadership. Later gifts to Cornell, including gifts in 2004 in the amount of $5 million to establish the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise as well as $2.5 million to create the S.C. Johnson Professorship in Sustainable Global Enterprise, supported the teaching of business and sustainability at the University. An additional gift created a new facility for the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.

===The Prairie School===

Johnson&#x27;s wife, Imogene Powers Johnson founded The Prairie School in Wind Point, Wisconsin, along with good friend Willie Hilpert in 1965. According to Johnson there was &quot;a need in our community to augment our respected public school system with a curriculum and a learning environment to develop individual student achievement in a college preparatory program.&quot;
The children of many S. C. Johnson employees attend the school to this day. This pre-K-12 college preparatory private school features small classes and an emphasis on strong academics, extra curricular activities, and community activism. The unique architecture of the school was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s designs.
Johnson served as the school&#x27;s Chairman of the Board until 1983, when he was named Founding Chairman Emeritus, a position he held until his death. His wife Imogene continued on the school&#x27;s board in the same position.

===Downtown Racine, Wisconsin===
Johnson took part in the organization of the Downtown Racine Development Corporation in the 1980s, a community effort to restore the historic downtown area of the city which is the hometown of Johnson and his companies. His employees were among the local citizens to first donate time and money and to convince the local government to donate millions to restoration projects, including developing the harbor along Lake Michigan to include a festival site.

Johnson further contributed to the revitalization of the downtown Racine area in 2002, when he commissioned William McDonough, a pioneer in green-architecture, to design the Johnson Building. Built on a former empty parking lot in the middle of the downtown area, the building is global headquarters for Johnson Outdoors and Johnson Financial Group. Local government officials named the street to the south of the building &quot;Sam Johnson Parkway&quot; in Johnson&#x27;s honor.

==Personal life==
Johnson met his wife, Imogene Powers Johnson, at Cornell University in 1946. They wed in 1954 and had been married fifty years at the time of his death. Johnson and his wife had four children, Samuel Curtis &quot;Curt&quot; Johnson III, Helen Johnson-Leipold, Herbert Fisk &quot;Fisk&quot; Johnson III and Winifred &quot;Winnie&quot; (Johnson) Marquart, as well as twelve grandchildren and three step-grandchildren at the time of his death.

===&quot;Carnauba, A Son&#x27;s Memoir&quot;===
Johnson&#x27;s father, Herbert Fisk &quot;H.F.&quot; Johnson Jr., and a team of Johnson Wax employees undertook a two-month, expedition to northeast Brazil in 1935 in search of a sustainable source of carnauba wax. On his return, he published a book, dedicating the book to his son: &quot;To Sammy, I hope you make this trip some day. It changed my life. Love, Dad.&quot; 
Sixty-three years later, in 1998, Johnson recreated his father&#x27;s journey with his two sons. Johnson undertook the journey, documented in a 2001 film called &quot;Carnauba: A Son&#x27;s Memoir&quot;, in a replica Sikorsky S-38 amphibious plane like the one his father used. During the course of the film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, &quot;I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, but something was telling me to do it… to recreate my father&#x27;s airplane and retrace his journey. [My wife] Gene said I was doing it to spend more time with my father after all these years... in the end that turned out to be true.&quot;

<doc id="1318719" wikidata="Q967021" url="?curid=1318719" title="Leonardo Del Vecchio">
<text>Leonardo Del Vecchio (22 May 1935 – 27 June 2022) was an Italian billionaire businessman, the founder and chairman of Luxottica, the world&#x27;s largest producer and retailer of glasses and frames, with 77,734 employees and over 8,000 stores. At the time of his death, his net worth was estimated at US$24.1 billion, the second richest person in Italy, and 54th in the world.

==Life and career==
Leonardo Del Vecchio was born on 22 May 1935 in Milan, Italy to an impoverished family from Barletta, Southern Italy. His father was a street vendor of vegetables who died before his birth and his mother already had four other children; he grew up in an orphanage. He began his career as an apprentice to a tool and die maker in Milan, but decided to turn his metalworking skills to make spectacle parts. In 1961, he moved to Agordo in the province of Belluno, which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry. The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership.

In 1967, he started selling parts to assemble spectacle frames under the Luxottica brand, and by 1971 he exited the contract manufacturing business to focus solely on the manufacture and distribution of finished eyeglass frames.

In 1974, he acquired Scarrone, a distribution company. In 1981, the company set up its first international subsidiary in Germany. A licensing deal with the designer Giorgio Armani was settled in 1988.

The company was listed in New York in 1990, and in Milan in December 2000, joining the MIB-30 (now S&amp;P/MIB) index in September 2003. The listing enhanced the company&#x27;s ability to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue in 1990, Persol and US Shoe Corporation (LensCrafters) in 1995, Ray-Ban in 1999 and Sunglass Hut, Inc. in 2001.

They went looking for more retail companies, acquiring Sydney-based OPSM in 2003, Pearle Vision in 2004, Surfeyes in 2006, and Cole National in 2004. They acquired Oakley in a US$2.1 billion deal in November 2007.

Del Vecchio owned a 10% stake in Italian investment bank Mediobanca.
==Shareholdings==
Delfin S.à r.l., the financial holding company of Leonardo Del Vecchio. Through his holding company he held the shareholdings:
*61.90% of Luxottica then 38.4% of EssilorLuxottica, born from the merger of Luxottica with the French company Essilor;
*28% of Covivio, a French property management company;
*13% of Luxair, Luxembourg airline;
*19.8% of Mediobanca, Italian investment bank;
*9.77% of Assicurazioni Generali, Italy&#x27;s biggest insurance company

==Personal life==
Del Vecchio was married three times. He had a total of six children, and lived in Milan. He had one son, Claudio Del Vecchio, and two daughters, Marisa and Paola, with his first wife. With his second wife he had another son, Leonardo Maria; and with his third wife two sons, Luca and Clemente. He remarried his second wife in 2010.

==Death==
Del Vecchio died from pneumonia at San Raffaele Hospital in Segrate, an eastern suburb of Milan on 27 June 2022 at the age of 87. The news of his death was announced by his company in a statement. &quot;EssilorLuxottica sadly announces today that its chairman has passed away,&quot; the group said in a statement, adding that the board would meet to &quot;determine the next steps&quot;.

<doc id="1318727" wikidata="Q1050623" url="?curid=1318727" title="Nohup">
<text>nohup is a POSIX command which means &quot;no hang up&quot;. Its purpose is to execute a command such that it ignores the HUP (hangup) signal and therefore does not stop when the user logs out.

Output that would normally go to the terminal goes to a file called , if it has not already been redirected.

== Use ==
The first of the commands below starts the program codice_1 in the background in such a way that the subsequent logout does not stop it.

$ nohup abcd &amp;
$ exit
Note that these methods prevent the process from being sent a &#x27;stop&#x27; signal on logout, but if input/output is being received for these standard I/O files (stdin, stdout, or stderr), they will still hang the terminal. See Overcoming hanging, below.

nohup is often used in combination with the nice command to run processes on a lower priority.

$ nohup nice abcd &amp;
==Implementations==
Some shells (e.g. bash) provide a shell builtin that may be used to prevent SIGHUP being sent or propagated to existing jobs, even if they were not started with nohup. In bash, this can be obtained by using codice_2; using the same builtin without arguments removes the job from the job table, which also implies that the job will not receive the signal. Before using codice_3 on an active job, it should be stopped by codice_4, and continued in the background by the codice_5 command. Another relevant bash option is codice_6, which automatically sends the HUP signal to jobs when the shell is exiting normally.

The AIX and Solaris versions of nohup have a codice_7 option that modifies a running process to ignore future SIGHUP signals. Unlike the above-described codice_3 builtin of bash, codice_9 accepts process IDs.

The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

==Overcoming hanging==
Note that nohupping backgrounded jobs is typically used to avoid terminating them when logging off from a remote SSH session. A different issue that often arises in this situation is that ssh is refusing to log off (&quot;hangs&quot;), since it refuses to lose any data from/to the background job(s). This problem can also be overcome by redirecting all three I/O streams:

$ nohup ./myprogram &gt; foo.out 2&gt; foo.err &lt; /dev/null &amp;
Also note that a closing SSH session does not always send a HUP signal to dependent processes, such as when a pseudo-terminal has not been allocated.

==Alternatives==
* A terminal multiplexer can run a command in a separate session, detached from the current terminal, which means that if the current session ends, the detached session and its associated processes keeps running. One can then reattach to the session later on.
:For example, the following invocation of screen will run somescript.sh in the background of a detached session:

$ screen -A -m -d -S somename ./somescript.sh &amp;

* The disown command is used to remove jobs from the job table, or to mark jobs so that a SIGHUP signal is not sent on session termination.

<text>Yasuo Takei (武井保雄, &quot;Takei Yasuo&quot;) (January 4, 1930 – August 10, 2006) was the founder and former chairman of Takefuji (武富士), Japan&#x27;s number one consumer finance group.

On 17 November 2004 he was given a three-year suspended sentence for wiretapping and defamation of character, after ordering the phones of two freelance journalists who had written articles critical of Takefuji to be bugged between December 2000 and February 2001. The defamation of character charge followed Takei&#x27;s ordering Takefuji employees to place libelous statements about one of the journalists on its web site.

According to a &quot;Forbes&quot; survey in June 2006, Takei was the second-wealthiest person in Japan (after Masayoshi Son) - he possessed an estimated net worth of US$5.6 billion.
