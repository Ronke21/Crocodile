<text>The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (usually referred to as the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, abbreviated MUTCD) is a document issued by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) to specify the standards by which traffic signs, road surface markings, and signals are designed, installed, and used. Federal law requires compliance by all traffic control signs and surface markings on roads &quot;open to public travel&quot;, including state, local, and privately owned roads (but not parking lots or gated communities). While some state agencies have developed their own sets of standards, including their own MUTCDs, these must substantially conform to the federal MUTCD. 

The MUTCD defines the content and placement of traffic signs, while design specifications are detailed in a companion volume, Standard Highway Signs and Markings. This manual defines the specific dimensions, colors, and fonts of each sign and road marking. The National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD) advises FHWA on additions, revisions, and changes to the MUTCD.

The United States is among the countries that have not ratified the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. The first edition of the MUTCD was published in 1935, 33 years before the Vienna Convention was signed in 1968, and 4 years before World War II started in 1939. The MUTCD differs significantly from the European-influenced Vienna Convention, and an attempt to adopt several of the Vienna Convention&#x27;s standards during the 1970s led to confusion among many US drivers.

== History ==
At the start of the 20th century—the early days of the rural highway—each road was promoted and maintained by automobile clubs of private individuals, who generated revenue through club membership and increased business along cross-country routes. However, each highway had its own set of signage, usually designed to promote the highway rather than to assist in the direction and safety of travelers. In fact, conflicts between these automobile clubs frequently led to multiple sets of signs—sometimes as many as eleven—being erected on the same highway.

Government action to begin resolving the wide variety of signage that had cropped up did not occur until the late 1910s and early 1920s when groups from Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin began surveying existing road signs in order to develop road signage standards. They reported their findings to the Mississippi Valley Association of Highway Departments, which adopted their suggestions in 1922 for the shapes to be used for road signs. These suggestions included the familiar circular railroad crossing sign and octagonal stop sign.

In January 1927, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) published the &quot;Manual and Specifications for the Manufacture, Display, and Erection of U.S. Standard Road Markers and Signs&quot; to set standards for traffic control devices used on rural roads. Despite the title, this manual did not have any guidance on pavement markings. In the archaic American English of the 1920s, the term &quot;road marker&quot; was sometimes used to describe traffic control devices which modern speakers would now call &quot;signs.&quot; In 1930, the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety (NCSHS) published the &quot;Manual on Street Traffic Signs, Signals, and Markings&quot;, which set similar standards for urban settings, but also added specific guidance on traffic signals, pavement markings, and safety zones. Although the two manuals were quite similar, both organizations immediately recognized that the existence of two slightly different manuals was unnecessarily awkward, and in 1931 AASHO and NCSHS formed a Joint Committee to develop a uniform standard for both urban streets and rural roads. This standard was the MUTCD.
The original edition of the &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways&quot; was published in 1935. Since that time, subsequent editions of the manual have been published with numerous minor updates occurring between, each taking into consideration changes in usage and size of the nation&#x27;s system of roads as well as improvements in technology.

In 1942, the Joint Committee was expanded to include the Institute of Transportation Engineers, then known as the Institute of Traffic Engineers. During World War II, the second edition of the MUTCD was released as &quot;War Emergency Edition&quot;.

In 1948, three years after World War II ended, the third edition of the MUTCD was released. The single most controversial and heavily debated issue during the early years of the MUTCD was the color of center lines on roads. This edition settled the long-running debate in favor of white, and also changed the standard color of stop signs from yellow to red. However, the 1948 MUTCD also allowed for two major exceptions to white center lines: yellow was recommended but not mandatory for double center lines on multi-lane highways and for center lines in no-passing zones.

In 1949, the United Nations Conference on Road and Motor Transport launched a research project to develop a worldwide uniform scheme for highway signs. In 1951, the UN conducted experiments in the U.S. to compare the effectiveness of national traffic sign standards from around the world. Signs from six countries were placed along the road for test subjects to gauge their legibility at a distance. The test strips were located along Ohio State Route 104 near Columbus, U.S. Route 250 and Virginia State Route 53 near Charlottesville, Minnesota State Highway 101 near Minneapolis, and other roads in New York. France, Chile, Turkey, India, and Southern Rhodesia reciprocated by installing MUTCD signs on their roads. In the U.S., the experiments attracted unexpected controversy and curious onlookers who posed a hazard. By September 1951, the experts working on the project were in favor of the American proposals for stop signs (at the time, black &quot;STOP&quot; text on a yellow octagon), &quot;cross road&quot;, &quot;left or right curve&quot;, and &quot;intersection&quot;, but were still struggling to reach consensus on symbols for &quot;narrow road&quot;, &quot;bumpy or uneven surface&quot;, and &quot;steep hill&quot;. 

In 1953, after cooperating with the UN conference&#x27;s initial experiments, the United States declined to sign or ratify the UN&#x27;s then-proposed protocol for a worldwide system of uniform road signs. There were two major reasons behind this decision. First, most U.S. roads and streets were (and still are) under state jurisdiction. Second, the United States was developing modern controlled-access highways at the time (culminating in the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956), and the novel problems presented by such new high-speed highways required rapid innovations in road signing and marking &quot;that would definitely be impaired by adherence to any international code&quot;. Despite the Americans&#x27; withdrawal from the research project, the experiments eventually resulted in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968. 

In 1960, the National Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices was again reorganized to include representatives of the National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities, then known as the American Municipal Association. In 1961, the MUTCD was again revised to make yellow center lines mandatory for the two exceptions where they had previously been recommended. The 1961 edition was the first edition to provide for uniform signs and barricades to direct traffic around road construction and maintenance operations.

In 1966, Congress passed the Highway Safety Act, , , which is now codified at &quot;et seq.&quot; It required all states to create a highway safety program by December 31, 1968, and to adhere to uniform standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a condition of receiving federal highway-aid funds. The penalty for non-compliance was a 10% reduction in funding. In turn, taking advantage of broad rulemaking powers granted in , the Department simply adopted the entire MUTCD by reference at . ((a)(1), also enacted in 1966, authorizes federal agencies to incorporate by reference technical standards published elsewhere, which means the agency may merely cite the standard and need not republish its entire text as part of the appropriate regulation.) Thus, what was formerly a quasi-official project became an official one. States are allowed to supplement the MUTCD but must remain in &quot;substantial conformance&quot; with the national MUTCD and adopt changes within two years after they are adopted by FHWA.
The 1971 edition of the MUTCD included several significant standards. The MUTCD imposed a consistent color code for road surface markings by requiring all center lines dividing opposing traffic on two-way roads to be always painted in yellow (instead of white, which was to always demarcate lanes moving in the same direction), and also required that all highway guide signs (not just those on Interstate Highways) contain white text on a green background. 

Another major change, inspired by the Vienna Convention, was that the 1971 MUTCD expressed a preference for a transition to adoption of symbols on signs in lieu of words &quot;as rapidly as public acceptance and other considerations permit.&quot; During what was then expected to be a transition period, the MUTCD allowed state highway departments to use optional explanatory word plaques with symbol signs and to continue using the previous standard word message signs in certain cases. Robert Conner, the chief of the traffic control systems division of the Federal Highway Administration during the 1970s, believed that symbol signs were &quot;usually more effective than words in situations where reaction time and comprehension are important.&quot; Conner was active in the Joint Committee and also represented the United States at international meetings on road traffic safety. However, several American traffic safety experts were concerned that American drivers would not understand the Vienna Convention&#x27;s unintuitive symbols, which is why the MUTCD allowed for explanatory word plaques. Most of the repainting to the 1971 standard was done between 1971 and 1974, with a deadline of 1978 for the changeover of both the markings and signage.
The U.S. adoption of several Vienna Convention-inspired symbol signs during the 1970s was a failure. For example, the lane drop symbol sign was criticized as baffling to U.S. drivers—who saw a &quot;big milk bottle&quot;—and therefore quite dangerous, since by definition it was supposed to be used in situations where drivers were about to run out of road and needed to merge into another lane immediately. American highway safety experts ridiculed it as the &quot;Rain Ahead&quot; sign. Many American motorists were bewildered by the Vienna Convention&#x27;s symbol sign with two children on it, requiring it to be supplemented with a &quot;School Xing&quot; plaque. (The American &quot;School Xing&quot; symbol was later redesigned to depict an adult crossing together with a child.) However, several signs from the Vienna Convention were successfully adopted into the 1971 MUTCD, including the red &quot;Yield&quot; sign, which replaced the previous yellow version, and the &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign, which replaced a word-only version. Because the Vienna Convention version was circular, it was given a square backing to conform with the MUTCD shape for regulatory signs, and the words &quot;DO NOT ENTER&quot; were superimposed to ensure American driver comprehension.

The 1971 MUTCD&#x27;s preference for a rapid transition to symbols over words quietly disappeared in the 1978 MUTCD. The 2000 and 2003 MUTCDs each eliminated a symbol sign that had long been intended to replace a word message sign: &quot;Pavement Ends&quot; (in 2000) and &quot;Narrow Bridge&quot; (in 2003).
The tenth edition of the MUTCD was published in 2009, with revisions in 2012. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 requires the USDOT to update the MUTCD quadrennially, and the eleventh edition was released in 2023. This edition allows painted red bus lanes, rules allowing more crosswalks and traffic signals, new rules for determining speed limits, signage for shoulders that are used part-time as traffic lanes, and new signage for electric vehicle charging stations and autonomous vehicles. It also adds painted green bike lanes, bike boxes, and bike-specific traffic lights. Rectangular Rapid-Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) were also added to the MUTCD; a pedestrian beacon for uncontrolled intersections consisting of two rectangular lights, side-by-side, which alternate flashing, under a yellow diamond with a walking person on it, above an arrow pointing out the crosswalk. RRFBs were previously on interim approval by FHWA since March 20, 2018. Transportation safety advocates criticized the changes as not going far enough to deal with a substantial spike in pedestrian fatalities, especially guidance setting speed limits based on the 85th percentile of actual driving speeds.

== Development ==
Proposed additions and revisions to the MUTCD are recommended to FHWA by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD), a private, non-profit organization. The NCUTCD also recommends interpretations of the MUTCD to other agencies that use the MUTCD, such as state departments of transportation. NCUTCD develops public and professional awareness of the principles of safe traffic control devices and practices and provides a forum for qualified individuals to exchange professional information.

The NCUTCD is supported by twenty-one sponsoring organizations, including transportation and engineering industry groups (such as AASHTO and ASCE), safety organizations (such as the National Safety Council and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety), and the American Automobile Association. Each sponsoring organization promotes members to serve as voting delegates within the NCUTCD.

== Adoption ==
Eighteen states have adopted the national MUTCD as is. Twenty-two states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the United States Department of Defense through the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) have all adopted supplements to the MUTCD. Ten states have adopted their own editions of the MUTCD &quot;in substantial conformance to&quot; an edition of the national MUTCD, annotated throughout with state-specific modifications and clarifications. The Guam Department of Public Works has also adopted the MUTCD in some form.

The following state-specific MUTCD editions are currently in effect:

* California Department of Transportation: &quot;California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (CA MUTCD)
* Delaware Department of Transportation: &quot;Delaware Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (DE MUTCD)
* Indiana Department of Transportation: &quot;Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (IMUTCD)
* Maryland State Highway Administration: &quot;Maryland Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MdMUTCD)
* Michigan Department of Transportation: &quot;Michigan Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MMUTCD)
* Minnesota Department of Transportation: &quot;Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MN MUTCD)
* Missouri Department of Transportation: &quot;Engineering Policy Guide&quot; (EPG), section 900
* Ohio Department of Transportation: &quot;Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (OMUTCD)
* Texas Department of Transportation: &quot;Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (TMUTCD)
* Utah Department of Transportation: &quot;Utah Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (Utah MUTCD)

== Enforcement ==
Federal funding is tied to compliance and serves as an enforcement mechanism for state and local governments. For private property owners, FHWA recommends &quot;encouragement&quot; rather than punishment. The use of non-compliant devices can also create liability in tort lawsuits for private owners and some governments.

From 2014 to 2018, New York placed over 500 non-compliant &quot;I Love New York&quot; tourism destination signs along its highways and expressways to encourage tourists to visit nearby destinations, especially those in economically depressed Upstate New York. FHWA contended that the signs violated numerous MUTCD rules, along with the general principle of the MUTCD that signs should be simple so that they are &quot;easy to identify, comprehend and understand in a matter of seconds as you are driving&quot;. After FHWA threatened to withhold $14 million in federal funding, New York removed the signs in November 2018.

== Other jurisdictions ==
The United States is among the majority of countries around the world that have not ratified the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (based primarily on European signage traditions), and the MUTCD differs significantly from the Vienna Convention. Apart from the 1971 effort to adopt several Vienna Convention-inspired symbol signs (as explained above), achieving worldwide uniformity in traffic control devices was never a priority for AASHTO because the number of motorists driving regularly on multiple continents was relatively small during the 20th century.

Warning signs (alerting drivers of unexpected or hazardous conditions) tend to be more verbose than their Vienna Convention counterparts. On the other hand, MUTCD guide signs (directing or informing road users of their location or of destinations) tend to be less verbose, since they are optimized for reading at high speeds on freeways and expressways.

The MUTCD lacks a mandatory sign group like the Vienna Convention does, a separate category for those signs like &quot;Right Turn Only&quot; and &quot;Keep Right&quot; that tell traffic what it must do instead of what it must not do. Instead, the MUTCD primarily classifies them with the other regulatory signs that inform drivers of traffic regulations.

===Canada===

For road signs in Canada, the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) publishes its own &quot;Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Canada&quot; for use by Canadian jurisdictions. Although it serves a similar role to the MUTCD, it has been independently developed and has a number of key differences with its US counterpart, most notably the inclusion of bilingual (English/French) signage for jurisdictions such as New Brunswick and Ontario with significant anglophone and francophone population, a heavier reliance on symbols rather than text legends and metric measurements instead of imperial.

The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) also has historically used its own MUTCD which bore many similarities to the TAC MUTCDC. However, as of approximately 2000, MTO has been developing the &quot;Ontario Traffic Manual&quot; (OTM), a series of smaller volumes each covering different aspects of traffic control (e.g., regulatory signs, warning signs, sign design principles, traffic signals, etc.).

=== Mexico ===

Road signs in Mexico are regulated by &quot;Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes&quot;″ Directorate-General for Roads (&quot;Dirección General de Carreteras&quot;), and uniformized under a NOM standard and the &quot;Manual de Señalización y Dispositivos para el Control de Tránsito en Calles y Carreteras&quot; (&quot;Manual of Signage and Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways&quot;). The signs share many similarities with those used in the United States and Canada. Like Canada but unlike the United States, Mexico has a heavier reliance on symbols than text legends.

Mexico signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals on November 8, 1968, but has yet to fully ratify it.

===Central America===

For road signs in Central American countries, the Central American Integration System (SICA) publishes its own , a Central American equivalent to the US MUTCD. Of the SICA countries, only Costa Rica has signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.

==== Belize ====
In Belize, road signs generally follow MUTCD standards. However, there are road signs unique to Belize.

===South America and Caribbean===
Road signs in South America and Caribbean are generally based on the MUTCD, with the exception of Antigua and Barbuda, French Guiana (overseas department of France), Dominica, Dutch Caribbean, Grenada, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname, which use European-style road signs, including triangular warning signs with a red border and a white background as in Europe. Of all the countries in South America, only four countries—Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Venezuela—have signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. Chile is also the only country in South America that has ratified this convention.

==== Argentina ====

==== Bolivia ====
Road signs in Bolivia are regulated by the &quot;Manuales Técnicos para el Diseño de Carreteras&quot; standard which is based on the United States&#x27;s MUTCD (FHWA), Central America&#x27;s &quot;Manuales Técnicos para el Diseño de Carreteras&quot; (SICA), Colombia&#x27;s &quot;Manual de Señalización Vial&quot; (Ministry of Transport), and Chile&#x27;s &quot;Manual de Carreteras&quot;. Thus, road signs used in Bolivia generally have many similarities to road signs used in the United States, Central America, Colombia and neighboring Chile.

==== Brazil ====

Road signs in Brazil are regulated by &quot;Manual de Sinalização Rodoviária&quot; and are based on the MUTCD.

==== Chile ====

Road signs in Chile are regulated by &quot;Manual de Señalización de Tránsito&quot; and are based on both the MUTCD and the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. Chile signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals on November 8, 1968, and ratified it on December 27, 1974, making it the only country in the Americas to ratify this convention. In Chile, both types of mandatory signs are used: European-style signs with white symbols on a blue background and a white border, signs with black symbols on a white background and a red border.

==== Colombia ====
Road signs in Colombia are regulated in the Manual de Señalización Vial standard, which is developed by the Ministry of Transport and based on the United States&#x27; MUTCD. Many regulatory signs are based on European signs, i.e. the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, while many warning signs are based on U.S. and Canadian signs, i.e. on MUTCD

==== Ecuador ====

Road signs in Ecuador are regulated in &quot;Manual Básico de Señalización Vial&quot; and &quot;Reglamento Técnico Ecuatoriano. RTE INEN 004-1:2011. Señalización vial&quot;. Signs are, in most ways, similar in design to those used in the United States.

Ecuador signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals on November 8, 1968 but has yet to fully ratify it.

==== Guyana ====
Road signs in Guyana generally follow the same design as those in the United States and are based on the MUTCD with the exception that some signs are reversed since the country drives on the left. However, most of current signs found in Guyana, are non-compliant with MUTCD standards.

==== Paraguay ====
Road signs in Paraguay are regulated in the &quot;Manual de Carreteras del Paraguay&quot; standard developed by the Ministry of Public Works and Communications ().

==== Peru ====
Road signs in Peru are regulated by the &quot;Manual de Dispositivos de Control del Tránsito Automotor para Calles y Carreteras&quot;, developed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications of Peru. This standard is based on the United States&#x27; &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD) developed by the Federal Highway Administration, Colombia&#x27;s &quot;Manual de Señalización Vial&quot; and Chile&#x27;s &quot;Manual de Señalización de Tránsito&quot;. As a result, road signs in Peru are similar in design to those used in the United States on one side and in neighbouring Chile and Colombia on the other side.

==== Venezuela ====
Road signs in Venezuela are regulated in &quot;Manual Venezolano de Dispositivos Uniformes para el Control del Tránsito&quot; and are based on the United States&#x27; MUTCD.

=== Asia and Oceania ===
A number of Asian and Oceanian countries use road signages based on the MUTCD. The most notable is Australia, which has a road signage system that is directly based on the MUTCD. Others use a mixture of MUTCD and international standards.

==== Australia ====
For road signs in Australia, this is covered by AS 1742 which is unofficially known as &quot;Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Australia&quot;, and it serves as a similar role to the MUTCD. As a result, road signs in Australia closely follow those used in U.S., but some sign designs closely follow the ones used in the United Kingdom.

* Australian warning signs have a yellow diamond with a black legend, following America&#x27;s practice. Australia remains the only country that still has the text-based version of the low-clearance signage. (Most other countries now use vertical arrows in between the clearance height.)
* Australian temporary warning signs are rectangular, following the United Kingdom practice, but they differ from the British temporary warning signs by having a yellow, or an orange background instead.
* Australian regulatory signs are similar to those used in America, except (at least since 1974) the speed limit signs which bear the red circle legend.

The typeface used for Australian road signs is the AS 1744 font which is based on Highway Gothic.

==== Thailand ====
Road signs in Thailand are standardized road signs similar to those used in other nations but much of it resembles road signage systems used in South American countries with certain differences, such as using a blue circle instead of a red-bordered white circle to indicate mandatory actions. As a result, Thailand road signage generally have many similarities to road signs used in the United States and Latin American countries.

Thailand is a signatory to the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, but has yet to fully ratify the convention.

<text>David Lee &quot;Tank&quot; Abbott (born April 26, 1965) is an American retired mixed martial arts fighter, professional wrestler, and author. He currently hosts his own podcast series titled &quot;The Proving Ground with Tank Abbott.&quot; Abbott is perhaps best known for being an icon in the early stages of mixed martial arts and the UFC, but has also competed in the PRIDE Fighting Championships, Strikeforce, EliteXC, and Cage Rage, challenging for the UFC heavyweight Championship once in 1997. His fighting style, which he developed brawling in the bars and streets of Huntington Beach, California, was described by his future manager Dave Thomas as &quot;Pit Fighting&quot;. He also authored a novel titled &quot;Bar Brawler&quot;.

==Background==
Abbott was born and raised in Huntington Beach, California. Abbott began practicing amateur wrestling when he was nine years old, and continued through high school where he also played football. He then continued wrestling in college at Cypress College, where he was a CCCAA All-American. He then attended California State University, Long Beach where he graduated with a degree in history. During this time he was trained in boxing by Noe Cruz who also trained world champion boxer Carlos Palomino at the Westminster Boxing Gym.

However, Abbott was mainly known for the many street fights that he had engaged in, rarely losing. While working at a liquor store to help pay for his college tuition, Abbott encountered a &quot;smart-ass&quot; customer. Abbott beat the customer severely, and the customer, who turned out to be the son of a detective, pressed charges for assault. Abbott was sentenced to six months in jail, the judge saying &quot;Mr. Abbott, you are a maniac. I&#x27;m surprised you haven&#x27;t killed somebody.&quot;

==Mixed martial arts career==
Abbott started his career in mixed martial arts when he applied to the UFC for its event UFC 6 in Casper, Wyoming. He was introduced to the UFC management by his future manager Dave Thomas, who credited him as a veteran street fighter who lifted 600lbs in bench press and had knocked out four men in his last brawl. Upon this description, the management compared him to the character &quot;Tank Murdock&quot; from the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Every Which Way But Loose&quot;, which encouraged them to give David the nickname of &quot;Tank Abbott&quot; and bill him as a &quot;pit fighter&quot; with over 200 street fights.

According to Abbott, this wasn&#x27;t the first time he applied to the UFC. Inspired by Kimo Leopoldo&#x27;s participation in UFC 3, he had tried to enter the promotion as soon as September 1994, but the UFC management only allowed him to fight from UFC 6 onwards, after Royce Gracie had ceased fighting in UFC. Art Davie would later confirm the Gracie family used its input in the management to limit fighters with amateur wrestling backgrounds, like Abbott himself, from entering the first events.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship (1995–2003)===
Abbott made his debut at UFC 6 in July 1995 as scheduled. He actively cultivated the tough character he had been given, firstly by giving a rude interview in which he derided martial arts and then by knocking out the Hawaiian Kapu Kuialua fighter John Matua, who weighed 400 lb, in the first 18 seconds of his opening fight. Abbott further solidified his reputation by mocking Matua&#x27;s convulsions after the KO while the ring doctors rushed the cage. Abbott advanced to the next round and was pitted against a similarly heavier adversary, Paul Varelans. After returning to the cage in midst of strong cheers, Abbott knocked out Varelans by ground and pound and knee strikes, all while mockingly smiling at his opponent laying beneath him. His post-fight interview also contained the notorious &quot;sexually aroused&quot; comment.

At the finals of the tournament, Abbott faced the Russian Oleg Taktarov in a fight that the announcers touted as a &quot;skill vs. power&quot; bout. Just as described, the match saw Abbott blocking Taktarov&#x27;s artful grappling attempts and damaging him in turn with hard punches and uppercuts. With both men becoming increasingly tired due to their previous fights and the high altitude of the location, the action moved to Taktarov&#x27;s guard, where Abbott avoided multiple submission attempts and punished him further. The fight was restarted standing, which would give Abbott the advantage, but by this point he was exhausted enough for a slightly better conditioned Taktarov to pull him down and lock a rear naked choke, thus winning the fight at the 17 minutes mark. Both men collapsed in exhaustion after the fight, and Taktarov had to be carried out of the cage. Although Abbott had failed at winning the tournament, referee John McCarthy considered him the next big star of the promotion after Royce Gracie.

Abbott returned the same year as part of the Ultimate Ultimate event, which saw runners-up and champions from the previous UFC tournaments gathered together. He first fought UFC 3 winner and ninjutsu practitioner Steve Jennum, whom he outweighed by 80lbs. Although Jennum proved capable of avoiding Tank&#x27;s strikes, Abbott submitted him with an improvised neck crank. However, his next opponent was Dan Severn, UFC 5 champion and a much more decorated freestyle wrestler than Abbott. Tank initiated the action strong, but he was overpowered and eventually kept on all fours while Severn rained elbows and knees on him. After fifteen minutes of absorbing strikes, Abbott managed to free himself, but Severn kept dominance until the end of the fight, which gained him the judges&#x27;s unanimous decision.

Abbott&#x27;s next UFC appearance would be in September 1996, at UFC 11. Accompanied by a young Tito Ortiz and dragging a knee injury without its adequate surgery, Tank entered the cage to fight professional boxer Sam Adkins, an affair he ended quickly in the first round by forearm choke against the cage wall. This tournament venture was cut short, however, by Scott Ferrozzo, a contender from Don Frye&#x27;s entourage who was billed as a &quot;pitfighter&quot; like Abbott himself. Ferrozzo was also fresher, as he came to replace Jerry Bohlander, who was injured in the previous round. The two fought evenly in the clinch for minutes, with Tank coming closer to a stoppage by opening a cut in Scott&#x27;s face, but Ferrozzo eventually gained the advantage with knees to the body and a heavy uppercut. At overtime, now with the crowd cheering for Ferrozzo, the latter controlled the action with knees and punches to win the judges decision. According to Abbott, Ferrozzo had to go to the hospital after the match, while he did not.

As the first time, Abbott was invited back to the next edition of Ultimate Ultimate at December 1996. His first opponent was Cal Worsham, a former U.S Marine whom Tank disposed of swiftly via wrestling and punching. A short brawl happened after the bout when Worsham suddenly tried to attack Abbott, as Abbott had kept hitting him while the referee stopped the bout. Abbott&#x27;s next fight met an even more brutal ending, as his opponent, Steve Nelmark, fell against the fence upon being knocked out and got his neck folded in a dangerous position. Despite the incident, Tank remained calm, and he was later quoted as &quot;If that man weren&#x27;t in the octagon, I would have kicked him about five times in the face. And I have, and I&#x27;ve done it many times.&quot;

At the end of the event, Abbott met his final adversary in Don Frye himself, with the winner of the fight gaining a title shot against Dan Severn. Despite Frye being a superior wrestler like Severn, Abbott caught him with a hard left jab and dominated the match onwards with wild strikes, appearing as if he could win by KO at any moment. However, by capitalizing on a punch in which Abbott overestimated and slipped down, Frye managed to capture his back and lock a rear naked choke, winning the fight. Abbott claimed he made a mistake by letting Frye got his hooks in, as he would have been planning to use them to snap his ankles. For his part, Frye praised Abbott, going to say the match featured the hardest hits he received in his entire career.

Ultimate Ultimate 1996 was the last UFC tournament in which Abbott partook, as around the same time the UFC began switching away from the tournament format. Abbott&#x27;s fortunes declined with the arrival of better trained mixed martial artists, who posed a much bigger challenge than the previously inconsistent opponents from the earlier UFC events. His debut in this new format was at UFC 13 in May 1997 against Vitor Belfort, whose fast-hitting boxing style had been criticized by Abbott while doing special commentary at UFC 12. Abbott scored an early takedown, but moved back to trade hits with Belfort standing; this proved to be an error, as Vitor immediately overwhelmed him with punches and dropped him to all fours. The Brazilian kept attacking Abbott until the match was stopped.

In October 1997, Abbott was contacted to fight in the Japanese Pride 1 event against Kimo Leopoldo, but he was unable to do so, having to be replaced by Dan Severn. Ironically, shortly after Abbott replaced Severn himself with four days notice in a title match for the UFC Heavyweight Championship against Maurice Smith at UFC 15, a circumstance he described as &quot;literally falling off the barstool into the octagon.&quot; Trying hard to press the action, Tank shockingly dropped the kickboxing champion with an early shot, but Smith controlled him through his defensive guard and a Kimura attempt. The action was restarted standing, but by this point Abbott was exhausted and offered little resistance to Smith&#x27;s low kicks, prompting the referee to stop the match.

Abbott bounced back from his losses with his performance at the first UFC show on Japanese soil, UFC Japan, where he was pitted against shoot-style wrestler Yoji Anjo. The American dominated the match with takedowns and right hands, avoiding submission attempts with short bursts of ground and pound every time they hit the mat, which eventually gained him the unanimous decision win. The event featured a tournament format, but Abbott forfeited due to a broken hand acquired while punching Anjo.

Back in the United States, at UFC 17, he followed with an impressive victory over renowned luta livre fighter Hugo Duarte, who was famous for his vale tudo fights against Rickson Gracie. Duarte had previously criticized Tank and his fighting skills, and he came close to proving himself right by almost locking a rear naked choke and an armbar in the first few seconds. However, Abbott blocked them successfully and captured Duarte&#x27;s back, landing heavy punches from there, completely knocking the Brazilian out. At the same event, Tank was suspended by UFC for verbally fighting with Allan Goes, which according to Abbott happened because he had cheered for the opponent of Goes&#x27;s teammate Wallid Ismail at UFC 12.

In October 1998, Tank visited Brazil next as part of UFC Brazil, facing another luta livre fighter, Pedro Rizzo, who came on a 5–0 record. The Brazilian proved to be a dangerous opponent when he stopped Abbott&#x27;s early barrage with several hard rights, but Abbott answered with a counterpunch that opened a cut near Pedro&#x27;s eye. Rizzo then adopted a more evasive approach, avoiding Tank&#x27;s overhands and grinding him with low kicks and his own counterpunches, which Tank counteracted himself again by taking Rizzo down and besieging his guard. However, the match had drained Tank&#x27;s energy, and Rizzo was able of dominating him with strikes from the bottom and more kick and punch combinations while standing. At the end, the Brazilian knocked Abbott out for the win, becoming the first opponent to do so. Abbott praised Rizzo after the match, although he claimed to believe the cage canvas had been greased to hinder the footing of wrestlers like him.

After his match with Rizzo, Abbott retired from MMA.

===Return (2003–2013)===
After his stint in professional wrestling, Abbott returned to mixed martial arts in 2003.

Abbott&#x27;s return fight was on February 23, 2003, at UFC 41, against Frank Mir. He lost his return bout via toe hold submission less than a minute into round one.

His next fight would be against fellow UFC veteran, Kimo Leopoldo at UFC 43. Abbott was taken down seconds into the fight, and was submitted via arm-triangle choke.

Abbott then faced Wesley &quot;Cabbage&quot; Correira at UFC 45. After a back-and-forth brawl, Abbott lost the fight via TKO after the ringside doctor determined he was unable to continue after suffering a cut over his right eye. Abbott and his corner got into a minor brawl with Correira&#x27;s team after being angered by Correira&#x27;s taunting when being declared the winner. Abbott was released from the UFC afterwards.

Abbott later had a rematch with Correira, at Rumble on the Rock 7. Abbott secured his first victory since his return, knocking Correira out with a hard right hand in the first round, becoming the first person to knock Correira out.

Abbott&#x27;s next fight was on August 28, 2005, against highly decorated judoka Hidehiko Yoshida at Pride Final Conflict 2005. Abbott lost via single wing choke submission in the first round.

Abbott&#x27;s next fight was against Paul Buentello, headlining on October 7, 2006. Abbott lost via knockout 43 seconds into the fight.

Abbott then fought Gary Turner at the main event of Cage Rage 21 on April 21, 2007. Abbott lost via TKO after a barrage of punches from Turner early in the first round.

Abbott&#x27;s last high-profile fight was against Kimbo Slice in the main event of . Abbott was knocked down early, but the fight was restarted after Kimbo landed shots to the back of Abbott&#x27;s head. Abbott would lose the bout via knockout seconds later.

His next fight was against former PRIDE veteran Mike Bourke on February 13, 2009, at the Selland Arena in Fresno, California, as part of the Valentine&#x27;s Eve Massacre Event. Abbott knocked out Bourke with a punch that inadvertently landed to the back of Bourke&#x27;s head, securing a victory for the first time in nearly four years.

In 2011 Abbott participated in an unsanctioned &quot;backyard brawl&quot; against Scott Ferrozzo, whom he previously fought at UFC 11. Abbott knocked down Ferrozzo early with a punch, before taking his back and holding dominant position for over 15 minutes, occasionally landing punches. He was declared the winner via unanimous decision. Bouncing back with a win following his loss to Slice, At King of the Cage: Fighting Legends, on April 13, 2013, Abbott fought for the Superfight Champion ship. He was defeated by longtime veteran Ruben &quot;Warpath&quot; Villareal by way of a 2nd-round TKO.

Abbott was expected to face fellow MMA veteran Dan Severn for the upstart UR Fight promotion on March 20, 2016. The contest was cancelled the day prior to the event as Abbott could not pass the required medical tests per the Arizona Fight Commission.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Championship Wrestling (1999–2000)===
Abbott worked as a professional wrestler with World Championship Wrestling (WCW); initially he was brought in as an opponent for Goldberg, on the understanding he was a &quot;legitimate&quot; fighter—who could render any opponent unconscious with a single punch, which became his wrestling finisher, &#x27;The Phantom Right&#x27;—and could boost Goldberg&#x27;s reputation. This feud, however, never developed.

Mere days prior to the Souled Out pay-per-view in 2000, WCW head writer Vince Russo was given the responsibility of booking a match to crown a new WCW World Heavyweight Champion. This came at the news that both WCW Champion Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett, two of the company&#x27;s top performers, were injured and could not participate at the event. To the dismay of company officials, Russo suggested having the mid-card Abbott win the Championship, but only to hold it briefly. The scenario would not take place, and Russo was consequently released from WCW while other bookers composed the Souled Out card, choosing Chris Benoit to win the belt. Abbott instead faced Jerry Flynn, a legitimate black belt in taekwondo and defeated him on the pay-per-view.

At the Superbrawl pay-per-view in 2000, Abbott was taking on Big Al in a leather jacket on a pole match. During the match, Abbott pulled a knife on Big Al, holding it to Al&#x27;s throat and shouting &quot;I could fucking kill you&quot; The cameras cut away as Mark Madden shouted &quot;I think he is trying to skin him!&quot; Abbott would win the match, but his push virtually ended at point.

He was featured in segments with the boy band parody stable, 3 Count as their &quot;biggest fan&quot;. He began feuding with the stable after they would not let him join the band; the feud ended when Abbott was released from WCW.

===Later career (2000, 2008)===
After being released from WCW, Abbott made an appearance for NWA Wildside on December 14, 2000, teaming with Kevin Northcutt losing to Bob Sapp and Stone Mountain in Cornelia, Georgia.

Abbott returned to the ring one last time on August 15, 2008, for Inoki Genome Federation in Tokyo, Japan losing to UFC fighter Josh Barnett.

==Other media==
In 1997, Abbott appeared as himself in the TV show &quot;Friends&quot;, defeating Jon Favreau&#x27;s character, the billionaire Pete Becker, who was dating Monica at the time. He appeared as himself in the 2013 web series &quot;Black Dynamite Teaches a Hard Way!&quot;, where a Black Dynamite mannequin teaches him what to do in case of an earthquake.

==Personal life==
In December 2018, Abbott revealed that due to his lifestyle his liver had to be replaced. Despite suffering several strokes during the surgery, Abbott survived and the transplant operation was successful.

<text>MPL Communications (which stands for McCartney Productions Ltd.) (NAICS 512230, SIC 2741) is the umbrella company for the business interests of Paul McCartney and was established in 1969. In addition to handling McCartney&#x27;s post-Beatles work, MPL is one of the world&#x27;s largest privately owned music publishers through its acquisition of other publishing companies.

==Profile==
The company was founded in February 1969 as Adagrove Limited but changed its name to McCartney Productions Ltd. in August 1969. One of the company&#x27;s first projects was the purchase of the rights to a film adaptation of &quot;Rupert Bear&quot; in early 1970.

==Music publishing==
MPL publishing owns a wide range of copyrighted material – covering nearly 100 years of music – by composers including McCartney, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Jerry Herman, Frank Loesser, Meredith Willson, Harold Arlen and many others, with songs, such as &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot; (made famous by Al Jolson), &quot;I&#x27;m Glad There Is You&quot;, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. Lennon–McCartney songs such as &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; became part of the catalog in the late 2010s after McCartney reached a settlement with longtime Beatles catalog holder Sony/ATV Music Publishing allowing the co-author to reclaim his songs fifty-six years from their initial publication. MPL also controls 25 subsidiary companies.

In 1976 MPL bought the North American rights to the Edwin H. Morris &amp; Co. catalogue from Morris himself, and most of Buddy Holly&#x27;s compositions, and in 2003 the rights to Carl Perkins&#x27; works. The Holly acquisition was followed by McCartney&#x27;s launch of &#x27;Buddy Holly Day&#x27; with a concert presented annually from 1976 to 1999.
Additionally, MPL has acquired rights to other cover songs recorded by the Beatles, and solo recordings by John Lennon, McCartney, Ringo Starr, and Denny Laine as follows:

<doc id="1334814" wikidata="Q3116292" url="?curid=1334814" title="Gregg Olson">
<text>Greggory William Olson (born October 11, 1966) is an American former professional baseball player, coach, scout and television sports commentator. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right-handed pitcher from 1988 through 2001, most prominently as a member of the Baltimore Orioles where he established himself as one of the premier relief pitchers in the American League (AL). Olson was named the AL Rookie of the Year in 1989, his first full season in the major leagues and, the following season was named to his only American League All-Star team. He set an Orioles team record of 41 consecutive scoreless innings and, he holds the team record for career saves.

During Olson&#x27;s major league tenure, he also played for the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2008, Olson was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame and, in 2021 he was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.

==High school and college==
Olson attended Omaha Northwest High School in Omaha, Nebraska, where he was a pitcher. He was named to the ABCA High School All-America Baseball Team in 1985. He led the Huskies to four straight state titles. His father, Bill Olson, was his high school coach. Olson appeared in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s &quot;Faces In The Crowd&quot; section for the 07-16-84 Vol 61, No. 3. In the state championship game of his senior year, Olson threw a no-hitter.

After graduating from high school in 1985, Olson attended Auburn University, where he played college baseball for the Auburn Tigers for three seasons. He was a decorated pitcher for the Tigers, earning First-Team All-America honors from &quot;Baseball America&quot; in both 1987 and 1988. Olson was a two-time SEC ERA leader, including a 1.27 mark in 1987, when he won back-to-back SEC Tournament games to lead the Tigers to their first NCAA Tournament since 1978.

==Professional career==
The Baltimore Orioles selected Olson in the first round, with the fourth pick, of the 1988 MLB draft, and he signed for a $200,000 signing bonus before making his major league debut on September 2, 1988. A reliever, he threw what baseball historian Sheldon Stewart referred to as a &quot;blazing fastball and devastating curve&quot;.

In 1989, Olson became the first reliever to win the American League Rookie of the Year Award. Olson also set an American League rookie record with 27 saves, and had a 5–2 mark with a 1.69 earned run average (ERA) and 90 strikeouts in 85 innings.

Selected to the All-Star team in 1990, Olson set a club record of 37 saves during the season and collected 31 and 36 in the next two years. On July 13, 1991, Olson combined with 3 other Baltimore pitchers in a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. In August 1993, Olson suffered a torn elbow ligament injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year. He finished with 29 saves and a career low 1.60 ERA, but Baltimore opted not to take a risk with him and signed Lee Smith as their new closer. Olson struggled with a succession of injuries over the next years, playing for seven different teams from 1994 to 1997.

 In 1998, Olson enjoyed a fruitful comeback with the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks. He set a franchise record of 30 saves (broken by Byung-hyun Kim in 2002) and was also part of a rare feat. On May 28, with Arizona leading the San Francisco Giants 8–5, Olson began the bottom of the ninth inning by striking out Darryl Hamilton, but the Giants then loaded the bases with two walks and a hit before Stan Javier had an RBI grounder that made it 8–6. After pinch-hitter J. T. Snow walked to load the bases, manager Buck Showalter ordered Olson to intentionally walk Barry Bonds, forcing home a run, and bringing up Brent Mayne, who worked the count full before he lined to right field for the third out. Olson put together one of the strangest saves imaginable, working around six walks in innings. He threw 49 pitches (not counting the bases-loaded intentional walk) and only 22 of them were for strikes. Olson&#x27;s only major-league hit was a home run during his last major-league at-bat, on April 20, 1998.

Olson was replaced by new closer Matt Mantei in 1999. He finished his career as a setup man for the Dodgers.

In a 14-year career, Olson compiled 217 saves with a 40–39 record, 588 strikeouts, and a 3.46 ERA in 672 innings pitched.

==Post-playing career==
On March 19, 2008, Olson was elected to the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame, and was inducted during a pre-game ceremony at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on August 9, 2008. He is currently a scout for the San Diego Padres.

In 2016, Olson served as pitching coach to actress Kylie Bunbury, who played &quot;Ginny Baker&quot; on the scripted FOX television series &quot;Pitch&quot;.

From 2017 to 2020 Olson was a color analyst for Orioles broadcasts on MASN. He additionally covered a series for MASN in 2023 when the O&#x27;s took on the Blue Jays May 19–21.

On March 29, 2021, Olson announced he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

<doc id="1334821" wikidata="Q2910790" url="?curid=1334821" title="Tyburn Brook">
<text>Tyburn Brook was a small tributary stream to the West Bourne or Westbourne and ran mainly in Hyde Park for a few hundred metres south by south-west. It has lost its catchment to natural drainage into the gravelly topsoil and to surface water, foul and in early Victorian style combined sewers (mixing both types of water) and its small collect, its source remains beneath the earth to feed into a mixture of these. The Serpentine, having been the Westbourne&#x27;s main showing is now fed by three boreholes instead. It is not to be confused with the much longer Tyburn, Ty Bourne or River Tyburn, but frequently was confused until the early 19th century as both were well west of the walls of the City of London.

==Literary references==
The brook was mentioned in William Blake&#x27;s Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion:
They groan’d aloud on London Stone,
They groan’d aloud on &quot;Tyburn’s Brook&quot;:
Albion gave his deadly groan,
And all the Atlantic mountains shook.

<doc id="1334823" wikidata="Q1138125" url="?curid=1334823" title="Yoshimitsu Morita">
<text>was a Japanese film director. He was known for his versatility, having directed satires, melodramas, crime thrillers, and pinku films. His most acclaimed films include The Family Game (1983), Sorekara (1985), Haru (1996), and Lost Paradise (1997). 
==Career==
Self-taught, first making shorts on 8 mm film during the 1970s, he made his feature film debut with &quot;No Yōna Mono&quot; (&quot;Something Like It&quot;, 1981).

In 1983 he won acclaim for his movie &quot;Kazoku Gēmu (The Family Game)&quot;, which was voted the best film of the year by Japanese critics in the &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; magazine poll. The magazine went on to vote it as the best Japanese film of the 1980s (in 2018) and as the 10th best Japanese film of all time (in 2009). This black comedy dealt with then-recent changes in the structure of Japanese home life. It also earned Morita the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Award.

The director has been nominated for eight Japanese Academy Awards, winning the 2004 Best Director award for &quot;Ashura no Gotoku&quot; (&quot;Like Asura&quot;, 2003). He also won the award for best director at the 21st Yokohama Film Festival for &quot;39 keihō dai sanjūkyū jō&quot; (&quot;Keiho&quot;, 2003) and the award for best screenplay at the 18th Yokohama Film Festival for &quot;Haru&quot; (1996). His 2007 film &quot;Sanjuro&quot; is a remake of the Kurosawa film.
==Themes ==
According to film critic Saburō Kawamoto in 1985, Morita&#x27;s early features presented a new cinema and sensibility that represented “the new human species” of postmodern Japan. Morita&#x27;s aesthetic was minimalistic, transparent, and featured empty landscapes with light and abstract characters. This was in direct contrast to the youth films of 1960s and 1970s in which the directors would aim for a fullness of sensuality, emotion, and physicality.

==Death and legacy==
Yoshimitsu Morita died from acute liver failure in Tokyo in December 2011. His last film &quot;Bokutachi kyūkō: A ressha de ikō&quot; (&quot;Take the &quot;A&quot; Train&quot;, 2011), a romantic comedy about two male train enthusiasts, was released in Japan in March 2012.

<doc id="1334828" wikidata="Q1906447" url="?curid=1334828" title="Maryland, My Maryland">
<text>&quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; was the state song of the U.S. state of Maryland from 1939 until 2021. The lyrics are from a nine-stanza poem written by James Ryder Randall in 1861 and sung to an old German folk melody, &quot;Lauriger Horatius&quot; — the same tune used for &quot;O Tannenbaum.&quot; The state&#x27;s general assembly adopted &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; as the state song on April 29, 1939.

The song&#x27;s words refer to Maryland&#x27;s history and geography, specifically mentioning several historical figures of importance to the state. Written at the beginning of the Civil War, it was used across the Confederacy as a battle hymn. It has been called America&#x27;s &quot;most martial poem&quot;.

Because of its origin in reaction to the Baltimore riot of 1861 and Randall&#x27;s support for the Confederate States, it includes lyrics that refer to President Abraham Lincoln as &quot;the tyrant&quot;, &quot;the despot&quot;, and &quot;the Vandal&quot;, and to the Union as &quot;Northern scum&quot;. It also mentions Virginia as an ally and includes that state&#x27;s official motto &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot;. The slogan was later shouted by Marylander John Wilkes Booth when he assassinated Lincoln. After more than ten attempts to change the state song, over 40 years, on March 22, 2021, both houses of the General Assembly voted by substantial margins to abandon &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; as the state song without a replacement. On May 18, 2021, Governor Larry Hogan signed the bill.

==History==
The poem resulted from events at the beginning of the American Civil War. During the secession crisis, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (referred to in the poem as &quot;the despot&quot; and &quot;the tyrant&quot;) ordered U.S. troops to be brought to Washington, D.C. to protect the capital and to prepare for war with the seceding southern states. Many of these troops were brought through Baltimore, a major transportation hub. There was considerable Confederate sympathy in Maryland at the time; many residents opposing the use of the U.S. Army to prevent secession. Riots ensued as Union troops came through Baltimore on their way south in April 1861 and were attacked by mobs. Many Union troops and Baltimore residents were killed in the Baltimore riots. The Maryland legislature summarized the state&#x27;s ambivalent feelings when it met soon after, on April 29, voting 53–13 against secession, but also voting not to reopen rail links with the North, and requesting that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. At this time the legislature seems to have wanted to avoid involvement in a war against its seceding neighbors. The contentious issue of troop transport through Maryland would lead one month later to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, also a Marylander, penning one of the United States&#x27; most controversial wartime rulings, &quot;Ex parte Merryman&quot;.

One of the reported victims of these troop transport riots was Francis X. Ward, a friend of James Ryder Randall. Randall, a native Marylander, was teaching at Poydras College in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, at the time and, moved by the news of his friend&#x27;s death, wrote the nine-stanza poem &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;. The poem was a plea to his home state of Maryland to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. Randall later claimed the poem was written &quot;almost involuntarily&quot; in the middle of the night on April 26, 1861. Being unable to sleep after hearing the news, he claimed that &quot;some powerful spirit appeared to possess me... the whole poem was dashed off rapidly... [under] what may be called a conflagration of the senses, if not an inspiration of the intellect&quot;.

The poem contains many references to the Revolutionary War as well as to the Mexican–American War and Maryland figures in that war (many of whom have fallen into obscurity). It was first published in the New Orleans &quot;Sunday Delta&quot;. The poem was quickly turned into a song—put to the tune of &quot;Lauriger Horatius&quot;—by Baltimore resident Jennie Cary, sister of Hetty Cary. It became instantly popular in Maryland, aided by a series of unpopular federal actions there and throughout the South. It was sometimes called &quot;the Marseillaise of the South&quot;. Confederate States Army bands played the song after they crossed into Maryland territory during the Maryland Campaign in 1862. By 1864, the &quot;Southern Punch&quot; noted that the song was &quot;decidedly most popular&quot; among the &quot;claimants of a national song&quot; for the Confederacy. According to some accounts, General Robert E. Lee ordered his troops to sing &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; as they entered the town of Frederick, Maryland, but his troops received a cold response, as Frederick was located in the unionist western portion of the state. At least one Confederate regimental band also played the song as Lee&#x27;s troops retreated across the Potomac after the bloody Battle of Antietam.

During the War, a version of the song was written with lyrics that supported the U.S. cause.

After the War, author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. compared &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; with &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; as the two most popular songs from the opposing sides in the early months of the conflict. Each side, he wrote, had &quot;a sword in its hand, each with a song in its mouth&quot;. The songs indicated as well their respective audiences, according to Holmes: &quot;One is a hymn, with ghostly imagery and anthem-like ascription. The other is a lyric poem, appealing chiefly to local pride and passion.&quot;

==Efforts to repeal, replace, or revise Maryland&#x27;s state song==
Unsuccessful efforts to revise the lyrics to the song or to repeal or replace the song were attempted by members of the Maryland General Assembly in 1974, 1980, 1984, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2016, 2018, and 2019.

In July 2015, Delegate Peter A. Hammen, chairman of the Maryland House of Delegates House Health and Government Operations Committee, asked the Maryland State Archives to form an advisory panel to review the song. The panel issued a report in December 2015 that suggested that it was time the song was retired. The panel offered several options for revising the song&#x27;s lyrics or replacing it with another song altogether.

The panel report stated that the Maryland state song should:
*celebrate Maryland and its citizens;
*be unique to Maryland;
*be historically significant;
*be inclusive of all Marylanders;
*be memorable, popular, singable and short (one, or at the most, two stanzas long).

In 2016, the Maryland Senate passed a bill to revise the song to include just the third verse of Randall&#x27;s lyrics and only the fourth verse of a poem of the same name, written in 1894 by John T. White. This revision had the support of Maryland Senate President Thomas V. &quot;Mike&quot; Miller, who had resisted any changes to &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; in the past. It was not reported out of the Health and Government Operations Committee in the House of Delegates, however.

On August 28, 2017, The Mighty Sound of Maryland, the marching band of the University of Maryland, suspended playing the song until they had time to review if it was aligned with the values of the school.

On March 16, 2018, the Maryland Senate passed an amended bill that would have changed the status of &quot;Maryland! My Maryland!&quot; from the &quot;official State song&quot; to the &quot;Historical State song&quot;. The bill received an Unfavorable Report by the House Health and Government Operations Committee on April 9, 2018.

A bill was filed in the House of Delegates for the 2020 session to appoint an advisory panel to &quot;review public submissions and suggestions for a new State song&quot;, but the bill did not advance past the hearing because the General Assembly adjourned early because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On March 29, 2021, the Maryland legislature passed a bill to remove &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; as the state song (with no replacement). Governor Larry Hogan signed the bill into law on May 18, 2021.

==Other uses of the melody==
The songs &quot;Michigan, My Michigan&quot;, &quot;Florida, My Florida&quot;, and &quot;The Song of Iowa&quot; are set to the same tune as &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;. The College of the Holy Cross and St. Bonaventure University both use the tune for their respective alma maters.

The socialist song &quot;The Red Flag&quot; has historically been sung to the same tune.

In the film version of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; is played at the opening scene of the Charity Ball when Scarlett and Melanie are reacquainted with Rhett Butler. Kid Ory&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band recorded an instrumental version of &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; on September 8, 1945, in the New Orleans jazz revival.
Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album &quot;101 Gang Songs&quot; (1961). In 1962, Edmund Wilson used the phrase &quot;patriotic gore&quot; from the song as the title of his book on the literature of the Civil War.

The third verse of &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; was sung annually at the Preakness Stakes by the United States Naval Academy glee club; that practice was discontinued in 2020.

<doc id="1334838" wikidata="Q1463544" url="?curid=1334838" title="Precovery">
<text>In astronomy, precovery (short for pre-discovery recovery) is the process of finding the image of a celestial object in images or photographic plates predating its discovery, typically for the purpose of calculating a more accurate orbit. This happens most often with minor planets, but sometimes a comet, a dwarf planet, a natural satellite, or a star is found in old archived images; even exoplanet precovery observations have been obtained. &quot;Precovery&quot; refers to a pre-discovery image; &quot;recovery&quot; refers to imaging of a body which was lost to our view (as behind the Sun), but is now visible again &quot;(also see lost minor planet and lost comet)&quot;.

Orbit determination requires measuring an object&#x27;s position on multiple occasions. The longer the interval between observations, the more accurately the orbit can be calculated; however, for a newly discovered object, only a few days&#x27; or weeks&#x27; worth of measured positions may be available, sufficient only for a preliminary (imprecise) orbit calculation.

When an object is of particular interest (such as asteroids with a chance of impacting Earth), researchers begin a search for precovery images. Using the preliminary orbit calculation to predict where the object might appear on old archival images, those images (sometimes decades old) are searched to see if it had in fact already been photographed. If so, a far longer observation arc can allow a far more precise orbital calculation.

Until fast computers were widely available, it was impractical to analyze and measure images for possible minor planet discoveries because this required much human labor. Usually, such images were made years or decades earlier for other purposes (studies of galaxies, etc.), and it was not worth the time it took to look for precovery images of ordinary asteroids. Today, computers can easily analyze digital astronomical images and compare them to star catalogs containing up to a billion or so star positions to see if one of the &quot;stars&quot; is actually a precovery image of the newly discovered object. This technique has been used since the mid-1990s to determine the orbits of many minor planets.

== Examples ==

In an extreme case of precovery, an object was discovered on December 31, 2000, designated , and a near-Earth orbit was calculated. Precovery revealed that it had previously been discovered on February 23, 1950 and given the provisional designation 1950 DA, and then been lost for half a century. The exceptionally long observation period allowed an unusually precise orbit calculation, and the asteroid was determined to have a small chance of colliding with the Earth. After an asteroid&#x27;s orbit is calculated with sufficient precision, it can be assigned a number prefix (in this case, (29075) 1950 DA).

The asteroid 69230 Hermes was found in 2003 and numbered, but was found to be a discovery from 1937 which had been named &quot;Hermes&quot;, but subsequently lost; its old name was reinstated. Centaur 2060 Chiron was discovered in 1977, and precovery images from 1895 have been located.

Another noteworthy case of precovery concerns Neptune. Galileo observed Neptune on both December 28, 1612 and January 27, 1613, when it was in a portion of its orbit where it was nearly directly behind Jupiter as seen from Earth. Because Neptune moves very slowly and is very faint relative to the known planets of that time, Galileo mistook it for a fixed star, leaving the planet undiscovered until 1846. He did note that the &quot;star&quot; Neptune did seem to move, noting that between his two observations its apparent distance from another star had changed. However, unlike photographic images, drawings such as those Galileo made are usually not precise enough to be of use in refining an object&#x27;s orbit. In 1795, Lalande also mistook Neptune for a star. In 1690, John Flamsteed did the same with Uranus, even cataloging it as &quot;34 Tauri&quot;.

One of the most exceptional suggested instances is related to the discovery of Ganymede. This again involved Galileo, who is usually stated to have discovered it in 1610. It has been postulated by Xi Zezong that Ganymede was discovered by the Chinese astronomer Gan De in 365 B.C., when he catalogued it as a small red star next to Jupiter during naked eye observation.

=== Dwarf planets ===
Discovery and precovery dates for well-known dwarf planets, minor planets and probable dwarf planets:

=== Oort cloud comets ===
Oort cloud comets can take 10+ years going from Neptune&#x27;s orbit at to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun). As modern survey archives reach fainter magnitudes and are more comprehensive, significant precovery images have become easier to locate.

<text>The beluga (), also known as the beluga sturgeon or great sturgeon (Huso huso), is a species of anadromous fish in the sturgeon family (Acipenseridae) of the order Acipenseriformes. It is found primarily in the Caspian and Black Sea basins, and formerly in the Adriatic Sea. Based on maximum size, it is the third-most-massive living species of bony fish. Heavily fished for the female&#x27;s valuable roe, known as beluga caviar, wild populations have been greatly reduced by overfishing and poaching, leading IUCN to classify the species as critically endangered.

==Etymology==
The common name for the sturgeon, as well as for the unrelated beluga whale, is derived from the Russian word (), meaning , probably referring to the extensive pale colour on the flanks and belly in beluga compared to that of other sturgeons.

==Description==

&quot;Huso huso&quot; shows typical characteristics of other sturgeon, such as an elongated body, heterocercal tail, partially cartilaginous skeleton, naked skin and longitudinal series of scutes.

The dorsal fin has 48 to 81 soft rays, and the anal fin, much shorter, has 22 to 41 soft rays. There are five in a series of longitudinal scutes: dorsal (one series, 9–17 scutes), lateral (two series, one per side, 28–60 scutes each) and ventral series (two series, one per side, 7–14 scutes each). The surface of the skin is covered by fine denticles. The rostrum is conical and contains numerous sensory pits on both ventral and dorsal surfaces. The mouth is large, crescent-shaped and protractile, with the upper lip continuous while the lower lip is interrupted by a large gap. The barbels are laterally compressed with foliate appendages, arranged in two pairs, originating midway or closer to the mouth than to the tip of the snout. 

However, during growth, the beluga sturgeons show evident morphologic changes: 

* Juveniles are slender, and the head is quite narrow with a mouth ventrally placed but projecting upward. The snout is thin and pointed (almost half of the head), scutes are evident, back and flancs are dark grey or black and the belly is white. 

* Adults are heavy-set, spindle-shaped, large and humpbacked. The head is massive with a very large protractile mouth that gradually moves in an almost frontal position during growth. The snout is quite short (one-third to one-quarter of the head), and scutes gradually undergo absorption and decrease in number with age. Colouring is blue-grey or dark brown, with silver or grey flanks and white belly. The dark dorsum contrasts strongly against the rest of the body;
* Very old specimens are stocky, with a large head and an enormous mouth.

=== Size ===

Among all extant bony fishes, the beluga sturgeon rivals the ocean sunfish (&quot;Mola&quot; sp.) as the most massive fish and is the second-longest bony fish after the giant oarfish (&quot;Regalecus glesne&quot;). It is the largest freshwater fish in the world. The beluga also rivals the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;) and the greenland shark (&quot;Somniosus microcephalus&quot;) for the title of largest actively predatory fish.

The largest accepted record is of a female taken in 1827 in the Volga estuary at and . Another specimen reportedly weighed and measured in length. Claims about greater length (, or even ); and weight (, , or even ) are disputed and unconfirmed; but they are not impossible. Several other records of aged sturgeon exceed . Among sturgeons, only the closely related Kaluga (&quot;Huso dauricus&quot;) can attain similar size, with a maximum weight of .

Beluga of such great sizes are very old (continuing to grow throughout life) and have become increasingly rare in recent decades because of heavy fishing of the species. Today, mature belugas that are caught are generally long and weigh . The female beluga is typically 20% larger than the male. An exceptionally large beluga recently caught weighed and measured .

==Biology==
Due to rampant overfishing, the average lifespan of beluga sturgeon is unknown, with no specimens living past their 56th year. However, the species is reportedly quite long-lived, being capable of surviving over 100 years in the wild.

===Spawning===
Like most sturgeons, the beluga is anadromous, migrating upstream in rivers to spawn on clean, hard substrate, which offers both support and cover to their sticky and adhesive eggs. Spawning biology and development of larval stages of the sturgeon, the most ancient fish of the Danube, co-evolved with the formation of the Danube valley, resulting in very different survival strategies in its early life stages. This appears to explain why different individuals of the same long-migratory species spawn as far upstream as upstream, while others spawn just . To make the long journey to very distant spawning grounds, the sturgeon adapted a two-stage migration strategy, beginning in autumn when they enter the Danube River overwinter in the river and the second stage is their spawning which takes place in the spring the river in fall and staying over winter in reaches of the river offering adequate substrate and water-flow resting conditions. Very few locations of existing wintering and spawning grounds for sturgeon are presently known in the lower Danube, and none are known to exist in the river&#x27;s upper reaches. The same situation concerns nursery sites upon which young sturgeon depend during their journey to the Black Sea.

Males attain sexual maturity at 12–16 years of age, whereas females do so at 16–22 years. They will spawn every four to seven years. At one time, beluga sturgeons could migrate up to upriver to spawn, but dams in almost every major tributary that they utilize have impeded historic spawning routes. The female lays her eggs on gravel from underwater. Upon hatching, the embryo are long, and 10–14 days later when they absorb their yolk sack, the length is . While swimming back to the ocean, the young sturgeon may cover up to a day.

===Diet===

&quot;Huso huso&quot; is a pelagic predator whose local distribution is not influenced by the nature of the substrates, unlike with most of the sturgeons that show demersal attitude. The prey is sucked into the mouth opening extremely quickly.

Juveniles feed on benthic invertebrates in rivers and shallow coastal waters, where they grow quickly. At the length of , they become largely piscivorous.
Different diets have been observed throughout the distribution range of beluga sturgeon, as well as according to spawners&#x27; migration stage. Adults mainly eat a great diversity of large fish (73% of the diet). Additional food items may include molluscs and crustaceans, aquatic birds and young seals (Caspian seals, &quot;Pusa caspica&quot;). 

The piscivorous diet of beluga sturgeon tends to change with age: in the Caspian Sea, it mainly consists of &quot;Clupeonella&quot; sp. for juveniles smaller than 40 cm, different species of Gobiidae for fish ranging between 40 and 280 cm and then mullets, &quot;Alosa&quot; sp. and other sturgeons for the largest. 

In brackish environments of the Ponto-Caspian basin, the genera &quot;Alosa&quot;, &quot;Aspius&quot; and &quot;Engraulis&quot; are the preferred prey. In estuaries and rivers of the same area, migrating spawners eat various cyprinids, mainly &quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; and &quot;Rutilus rutilus&quot;, &quot;Sander lucioperca&quot; and, among sturgeons, &quot;Acipenser ruthenus&quot; is the main prey.

Little is known about the diet of the extinct Adriatic population. It has been reported that in marine and brackish environments, adult Adriatic &quot;H. huso&quot; foraged primarily on molluscs (Cephalopoda, of which common cuttlefish, &quot;Sepia officinalis,&quot; and European squid, &quot;Loligo vulgaris,&quot; are particularly common in the Adriatic Sea) and fish belonging to the families Gadidae, Pleuronectidae, Gobiidae, Clupeidae, Scombridae and Mugilidae, but also on big crustaceans; in the rivers, they fed mainly on local Cyprinidae.

== Habitat ==
Beluga sturgeon are considered euryhaline, capable of moving freely between freshwater and estuaries, and thus can live in waters of varying saline content. Sturgeons are quite a durable species and can survive some of the most altered and polluted rivers in the world.

Historically, beluga sturgeon were found in the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, Adriatic Sea, Sea of Azov, and all rivers interconnecting these waterways. Unfortunately, this range has been greatly reduced in modern times to the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, and a few rivers such as the Danube, with attempts to reintroduce Belugas into various historic locations. 

== Uses ==

Beluga caviar is considered a delicacy worldwide. The flesh of the beluga is not particularly renowned, but it is a hearty white meat similar to that of swordfish. Beluga caviar has long been scarce and expensive and the fish&#x27;s endangered status has made its caviar even more expensive throughout the world.

The beluga&#x27;s air bladder is said to make the best isinglass.

== Status ==
IUCN classifies the beluga as critically endangered. Due to aforementioned poaching of the sturgeon, the Danube is the only river remaining with naturally reproducing sturgeon populations within the European Union. The sturgeon remains a protected species listed in Appendix III of the Bern Convention, and its trade is restricted under CITES Appendix II. The Mediterranean population is strongly protected under Appendix II of the Bern Convention, prohibiting any intentional killing of these fish.

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has banned imports of beluga caviar and other beluga products from the Caspian Sea since 6 October 2005, after listing beluga sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

=== Repopulation efforts ===
Since 2015, an official captive breeding scheme has been established in Italy, with beluga from the Azov Sea. Then, after the building of a fish ladder on Isola Serafini dam, on 2019 hundreds of young microchipped beluga and 60 tagged subadults were released into the Po river, following EU Projects (Life Ticino Biosurce). Since then, many &quot;H. huso&quot; were released in the Po river, attempting to resurrect the extinct Adriatic population.

Management of sturgeon fisheries within the Caspian Sea began in the 1950s and while the initial regulations had honorable intentions, they achieved dwindling effects due to the ever present demand for the fish&#x27;s caviar. In July 2016, Sturgeon Aquafarms in Bascom, Florida, became the first and only facility in the world to obtain a permit exemption for the sale of beluga sturgeon and its caviar in the U.S. Since 2017, the company has assisted in beluga sturgeon repopulation efforts across the world by providing over 160,000 fertilized eggs to the Caspian Sea region.

Following a World Wildlife Fund crowdfunding appeal, over 7,000 three month-old beluga sturgeons were released into the Danube River. Despite repopulation efforts, the beluga sturgeon continues to face poaching threats. In 2021, two Romanian men in Grindu, Ialomita, were caught trying to smuggle a 140 kilogram, 2.5-metre beluga sturgeon in a wagon; the fish was later safely returned to the river.

== Threats ==
The beluga sturgeon is confronted by several critical threats that imperil its existence. Illegal harvesting, habitat disruption through dam construction, and pollution are among the most pressing challenges faced.

=== Illegal harvesting and poaching ===
The beluga sturgeon faces a significant threat from illegal catches for its meat and caviar. The excessive harvesting and a sharp increase in poaching have removed the largest and most mature specimens from the population, almost eliminating natural reproduction. This exploitation has pushed the species to the brink of extinction.

=== Habitat impoundment ===
The construction of dams, such as the Iron Gate in the Danube and the Volgograd Dam, has severely reduced the beluga sturgeon&#x27;s available spawning grounds. These dams have blocked access to crucial river habitats, leading to a significant reduction in the species&#x27; ability to reproduce. Similar habitat loss has occurred in other rivers due to dam construction, greatly impacting the species&#x27; survival.

=== Pollution ===
Pollution from various sources, including oil, industries, sewage, and agriculture, is a critical threat to the beluga sturgeon. The species&#x27; long lifespan makes it vulnerable to pesticide contamination, resulting in reduced reproductive success and other health issues. Pollution negatively affects the quality of the sturgeon&#x27;s habitat, compounding the challenges faced by this endangered species.

<doc id="1334841" wikidata="Q603839" url="?curid=1334841" title="The Family Game">
<text>is a 1983 Japanese comedy and family drama film directed by Yoshimitsu Morita. It follows the story of a nuclear family of four whose father hires a tutor for the younger son, a distracted and low-ranking middle school student who will soon be taking his high school entrance exam. The idiosyncratic tutor soon becomes a father figure for the boy, as the father is distant and unfeeling. Through his interactions with the family, he shakes up the emotional shallowness and artificiality that ties them together. The &quot;game&quot; of the title refers to family interactions based on the roles that each member is expected to play and not on genuine emotional ties. It was the first major film by the director and is an example of postmodern cinema. The film contains elements of black humor and social satire.

The Family Game is considered one of the best Japanese films by film critics. Kinema Junpo, the premiere film magazine of Japan, ranked it as the 10th best Japanese film of all time (in 2009), the best Japanese film of the 1980s (in 2018), and the best Japanese film of the year (in 1983). The film was also selected as the best Japanese film of 1983 by the BFI. The movie missed the Japan Academy Prize for the Best Picture (losing out to Palme d&#x27;Or Winner &quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot;).

==Plot==
The Numata family consists of the father, Kōsuke (Juzo Itami); mother, Chikako (Saori Yuki); and two sons, Shinichi (Jun&#x27;ichi Tsujita) and Shigeyuki (Ichirōta Miyagawa). The family lives together in a small apartment located in a newly built complex of reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay. Mr. Numata is a salaryman who is physically and emotionally absent. Mrs. Numata is a stay-at-home mom who is devoid of other relationships or hobbies and is emotionally drained from caring for her two teenage sons. Shinichi, the elder son, is in a first-rate high school and makes his father proud. Shigeyuki, the younger son, is nearing the end of junior high school and will soon be taking the high school entrance exam. However, Shigeyuki&#x27;s grades are poor, and he is only interested in roller coasters. He is also bullied at school by a group of fellow students, led by his one-time best friend.

The father has very high expectations for his children - they must go to a top high school which must then be followed by a prestigious national university, etc. He had hired multiple private tutors for Shigeyuki to no avail. He finds a new tutor, Yoshimoto (Yūsaku Matsuda), for Shigeyuki and places all responsibilities for his exam on him. Yoshimoto is eccentric; however, he fills in the role of father that Mr. Numata has vacated. He kisses Shigeyuki on the cheek and sits close to him to hold conversations in a near whisper; he also hits Shigeyuki to assert discipline. He makes it clear to Shigeyuki that his attention, concern and even affection are devoted to him. Even though Yoshimoto is a seventh-year student from a third-rate university, Shigeyuki’s marks improve significantly under his guidance. Yoshimoto also teaches Shigeyuki basic self-defense, which Shigeyuki puts to use against his main school bully, who was once his best friend. Eventually he passes the exam for the high school. At a family dinner celebration, with all five main characters present, a food fight breaks out and Yoshimoto begins to riot, throwing spaghetti around wildly, pouring wine indiscriminately on the table and hitting the Numatas.

==Cast==
* Yūsaku Matsuda as Katsu Yoshimoto: a student at a minor university whose background and private life are undisclosed. He is unmarried and has a beautiful girlfriend. He shows some generosity in the film but his external persona is blunt and arrogant. He carries a botanical encyclopedia with him and looks at it when he tutors Shigeyuki.
* Juzo Itami as Kōsuke Numata: The patriarch of the family; he is the Numata that we see least, as most of the time he is at work or getting drunk and arriving home at night. He does not like to get directly involved in the raising and education of his children, leaving that work to his wife and to tutor Yoshimoto. 
* Saori Yuki as Chikako Numata: The mother, she is treated as a servant and sometimes berated by the males of the house. Her hobby is leather crafting. 
* Ichirōta Miyagawa as Shigeyuki Numata, the younger brother: a third-year junior high school students who ranks 9th in his class, counting from the bottom. He loves roller coasters. 
* Junichi Tsujita as Shinichi Numata, the older brother. He attends a top high school and early in the film is considered a model son by the father. Throughout the film his interest in studying decreases. He has a crush on a girl from his class, but she does not seem very interested in him. 
* Yoko Aki as Yoshimoto&#x27;s girlfriend. 
* Jun Togawa as Neighbor&#x27;s wife

==Genre==

=== The Family Drama Tradition in Japan ===
The family drama is a popular and influential film genre in Japan. Films in the genre tell stories in which many of the main characters are members of the same family. The stories revolve around how the family members respond to challenges. Both Yasujirō Ozu and Mikio Naruse, amongst the very best of Japan’s “golden age,” worked often in the genre. Almost all of Ozu’s post-war films were family dramas. Yoji Yamada and Hirokazu Kore-eda, amongst the most famous directors of their generation, have also directed many acclaimed family dramas.

Japanese family dramas are often about the deterioration of family ties. Pre-war films frequently attributed blame for this loss to the forces of urbanization and economic modernization which led to a decline in family cohesion (as in Ozu&#x27;s The Only Son). Post-war films often criticized the younger generation’s disrespect towards their parents, with the parents sometimes portrayed as paragons of devotion (as in Kinoshita&#x27;s Tragedy of Japan). In the postmodern cinema, blame can shift to the “salaryman,&quot; the typical, white-collared salaried employee, who is shown to be a neglectful or ineffectual father in many films, including &quot;The Family Game&quot;. These fathers are weak and work-oriented and avoid their family obligations; the children are not able to depend on them for emotional support or moral guidance.

==Style==

=== Sound Design ===
Acoustically, the film was recorded very close to the actors – with microphones that could capture the softest ambient sounds and magnify them so that they would interfere with the ability of the characters to communicate – highlighting the alienation of the characters. Another alienating technique utilized by the filmmakers in two scenes was to make all sounds inaudible except for the ambient sounds – thereby making the character’s voices inaccessible to the audience; this happens first in a conversation between Shinichi and a female classmate, and then again when Shinichi and mother are listening to and talking about an American song that the audience cannot hear.

=== Visual Design ===
The average shot length (ASL) of &quot;The Family Game&quot; is 23 seconds, and according to Barry Salt the ASL of the average film directed from 1982 to 1987 was only 6 seconds.

In the Numata household, characters often inhabit the frame in claustrophobically close proximity. This is highlighted by the filmmaker’s emphasis on closeups indoors and long shots out of doors. The father is the main character most typically presented in medium shots (dominated by ambient sounds). On the other hand, the tutor, Yoshimoto, is more frequently presented in close ups (and a more balanced soundtrack). An example of this technique occurs in the scene when Shigeyuki&#x27;s classmate, Tsuchiya, suddenly appears in the Numata&#x27;s front door; Morita is able to include all five characters in one cramped shot, each with a different expression on their face.

==Themes==

=== Overview ===
The film focuses on a dysfunctional middle-class nuclear family—each family member is connected not internally, but through the social roles they are expected to take on, and the pressure of these social expectations further accelerates the breakdown in their communication. Individual worth becomes quantified chiefly in terms of success and class ranking. According to Donald Richie, the &quot;game&quot; that the family plays is an &quot;enactment the members agree to go through with, a set-up filled with tricks and dodges, a kind of gamble the results of which are not serious.&quot; The Numata household is like a model home display - inside of it the characters engage in more role-playing than &quot;real life&quot; living. As the girl student who has a crush on Shigeyuki states in one scene, it is better to get along and curry favor with the group than to be true to oneself.

The tutor, Yoshimoto, is the only main character who consistently deviates from the &quot;game&quot; and becomes a more genuine father figure for Shigeyuki. Yoshimoto, unlike the parents, develops an intimate relationship with the boy. He kisses him on the cheek when they first meet, sits near him, places his hand on the boy&#x27;s bare thigh after his fight with a classmate, teaches him martial arts, and even gives him a piggyback ride after the entrance exam. The tutor through this physicality and his concern for the boy provides him an alternative relationship based on human warmth.

Japanese critics saw the film as showing the change to a new epoch and a post-modern sensibility. One said that if Japanese before and during the high growth economy defined their reality first though &quot;ideals&quot; and then through &quot;dreams,&quot; and tried to change reality according to those visions, then in the post-high growth era, from the mid-1970s on, they no longer tried to change reality but to remain content with reality as &quot;fiction.&quot; The Numatas&#x27; table is not unrealistic but fixes the &quot;un-naturalness&quot; of reality itself in an age when families watch television while eating. This epochal shift was marked, another critic said, by Morita&#x27;s films and the works of novelist Haruki Murakami and musician Sakamoto Ryuichi, leading to a culture which celebrates meaninglessness. One scholar saw in the film an inversion of the traditional Ozu family, which she wrote was &quot;reserved, considerate, and gourmet.&quot; Morita&#x27;s film overturns this framework through shock value, bizarre framing, deadpan food fights, sexual innuendo and even homosexual undertones.

=== Commodification ===
The father rather than devoting his own time to his younger son’s education offers the tutor a financial incentive to help his son get better grades. The attitude of the father is that his son’s education is a commercial venture that he is invested in properly funding so that it will pay off with dividends in the future. The tutor’s attitude is different, he shows a parental concern that will not be renumerated.

Morita associates various characters in the film with an object. Such as the father and his soymilk carton, the mother and her leatherwork, the tutor and his flora encyclopedia, the older brother and his telescope, the younger brother and his spacewarp. Murakami Tomohiko argues that these associations are a filmic equivalent to the commodity catalogues in Japanese fashion magazines of the 1980s.

=== Last Dinner Scene ===
The five main characters celebrate Shigeyuki&#x27;s success with his entrance exam with a sumptuous dinner towards the end of the film. The whole dinner scene is captured in an 8-minute static long take, which shows the characters looking in the direction of the camera seated on the straight table with tutor Yoshimoto in the middle. The dinner devolves into a verbal altercation between father and older son about the boy&#x27;s future education and then into a food fight involving the four males, provoked by Yoshimoto&#x27;s antics. Finally, Yoshimoto hits each member of the family once into the ground before making his leave. Many critics have commented on this dinner scene as it is the most famous and iconic scene of the film.

Tadao Sato commented on the influence of Ozu on The Family Game. Ozu liked to seat family members facing the same direction in order to show the unity of their feelings. Morita deliberately makes use of this Ozu-esque device in the dinner scene. But in the new Japanese culture represented by the Numatas, the linear composition no longer means accord, and instead their seating in closed proximity results in conflict.

Keiko Mcdonald wrote that the &quot;hero&quot; (Yoshimoto) is formally accepted into the Numata&#x27;s club through this dinner, but then promptly decides to leave that club. She notes that thanks to Yoshimoto&#x27;s disorderly behavior, the family members are for the first time able to express emotions that they would always keep repressed.

Vincent Canby noted that the tutor acts like an &quot;avenging angel&quot; and shows the Numatas what he really thinks about them through his violence. He goes on to say, &quot;This one-man riot is the humanist&#x27;s only response to the genteel inhumanism we&#x27;ve been witnessing throughout the film.&quot;

==Reception==
Vincent Canby, writing for the New York Times in 1984, praised the “extraordinary visual design” and also wrote that &quot;The Family Game is so rich that Mr. Morita would seem to be one of the most talented and original of Japan&#x27;s new generation of film makers.&quot;

==TV Series==
The Family Game was adapted into a TV series in 2013 by Fuji TV, starring Sho Sakurai as the tutor Kōya Yoshimoto.

<doc id="1334851" wikidata="Q706988" url="?curid=1334851" title="Shannon Briggs">
<text>Shannon Briggs (born December 4, 1971) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1992 and 2016. He held the World Boxing Organization (WBO) heavyweight title from 2006 to 2007. Briggs was known for his formidable punching power and aggression, possessing an 88.3% knockout-to-win rate with 37 knockout wins in the first round.

==Early life==
Briggs was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. For a period in his childhood he was homeless. In 1983, when Briggs was 12, he saw Mike Tyson in Bristol Park, Brooklyn, New York. Briggs&#x27; friends called out, &quot;Here comes Mike.&quot; Briggs said he was too scared to run and that seeing Tyson that day &quot;changed his life.&quot; At age 17, Briggs began training at Jimmy O&#x27;Pharrow&#x27;s Starrett City Boxing Club in Brooklyn, NY. He was diagnosed with asthma as a child. Briggs&#x27; mother died in Brownsville due to a heroin overdose on December 4, 1996, Briggs&#x27; 25th birthday.

==Amateur career==
Coached by James O&#x27;Farrell, Briggs got his start at the Starrett City Boxing Club. Briggs competed mainly in heavyweight division (201 lbs,) he became New York City Golden Gloves champion, New York State Champion, National P.A.L. Champion and finished second at the Pan American Games in 1991, stepping into the finals on several byes, thus gaining a silver medal already without a single fight, though losing the final to Félix Savón. In 1992 he became the United States Amateur Champion. Along with two national titles in heavyweight was the winner of the 1991 Daily News Golden Gloves superheavyweight title. By December 1991 he was ranked third nationally in his class.

As an amateur he sparred with Phil Jackson, who was a pro at that time, preparing to fight Razor Ruddock. Brigg&#x27;s lawyer and adviser (equivalent of pro&#x27;s manager) at that time was Mike Marley, the ex-Post boxing writer. Marley later managed Briggs as a professional.

== Professional career ==

=== Early career ===
Briggs began his career in 1992 and was undefeated in his first 25 fights, and was trained by Teddy Atlas. He suffered his first loss when he was knocked out in three rounds by undefeated Darroll Wilson in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1996. The fight was broadcast on HBO and was a showcase of young heavyweight fighters.

=== Lineal heavyweight champion ===
==== Briggs vs. Foreman ====

Briggs fought against lineal champion George Foreman on November 22, 1997, at the Trump Taj Majal Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Coming into the fight, Briggs sported a 29–1 record with 24 of his wins coming by way of knockout; collectively, he fought a total of 86 rounds. However, despite his record, his one loss had been a third-round knockout against Darroll &quot;Doin&#x27; Damage&quot; Wilson on HBO the previous year which halted his momentum and hurt his status as one of the premier up-and-coming heavyweights. However, realizing that a win over Foreman would get him back into contention, Briggs vowed to be ready for the fight stating that he was &quot;confident that I can go in and fight for 12 rounds and win a decision.&quot;

After capturing the WBA and IBF titles from Michael Moorer late in 1994, George Foreman forfeited both titles but retained the lineal championship and successfully defended that crown (as well as the lowly regarded WBU heavyweight title) against then-undefeated prospects Crawford Grimsley and Lou Savarese. Following his win over Savarese, Foreman fought Briggs.

The fight was controversial as Briggs ultimately picked up the victory by way of majority decision. Through the course of the fight, Foreman landed more punches and had a higher percentage of his punches land than Briggs. Foreman landed 284 of his 488 punches for a 58% success rate while Briggs landed 45% of his punches, going 223 for 494. Foreman made $5 million, whilst Briggs received a $400,000 purse.

Foreman spent much of the fight as the aggressor while Briggs spent a lot of the fight retreating. In the later rounds Foreman&#x27;s power punches seemed to take a toll on the younger Briggs, as he began slowing down and all but abandoned his tactic of moving away from Foreman and was hit from some heavy shots as a result. In the 12th and final round, Foreman tried hard for a knockout victory and was able to break Briggs&#x27; nose but was unable to score a knockdown. As a result, the result went to the judge&#x27;s scorecards.

One judge scored the fight a draw at 114–114, while the other two had the fight scored 116–112 and 117–113 in favor of Briggs, giving him both the majority decision win and the lineal heavyweight title.

==== Briggs vs. Lewis ====

After Lennox Lewis successfully defended his WBC title in a dominating first-round knockout victory over Andrew Golota, he agreed to defend his title against the winner between Briggs-Foreman in the elimination bout organized by the WBC to determine who would become Lewis&#x27; next opponent. Though Foreman&#x27;s promoters protested the result and Lewis instead turned his attention to a potential unification match with Evander Holyfield, Lewis ultimately agreed to defend his WBC championship against lineal champion Briggs in a fight billed as &quot;March Badness&quot;.

In the fifth round, Lewis knocked Briggs down for the third time with a powerful right hook at 1:09 into the round. Briggs lay flat on his back for five seconds but got back up at the count of eight and continued with the fight. After Briggs collapsed to the mat following a missed left hook, referee Frank Cappuccino stopped the fight and awarded Lewis the victory by technical knockout. Lewis earned $4 million compared to Briggs $1 million. In 2015, Lewis stated that Briggs had the fastest hands and best punching power of any opponent he ever faced.

=== Career from 1998–2006 ===
After the loss to Lennox Lewis, Briggs spent seven years fighting against low ranked opponents. He scored 17 wins, all by knockout, 2 losses, 1 by majority and 1 by unanimous decision and a majority draw versus Frans Botha in 1998. Notable wins were against Ray Mercer, Brian Scott, Luciano Zolyone, Dicky Ryan and Chris Koval.

=== WBO heavyweight champion ===
==== Briggs vs. Liakhovich ====

Briggs won the WBO heavyweight title when he knocked out Sergei Liakhovich in the last round of a November 4, 2006, matchup. After a lackluster 11 rounds which left the Arizona crowd restless, Briggs was losing on all three judges&#x27; scorecards 106–103, 106–103, and 105–104. Briggs pressed the fight in the 12th round and knocked Liakhovich down. Briggs subsequently trapped him on the ropes and continued his assault, knocking Liakhovich out of the ring. Liakhovich landed on a ringside table, and the referee stopped the bout. If the referee had allowed the fight to continue after the second knockdown and Liakhovich had come back into the ring within 20 seconds, it would have resulted in a draw. The official time was 2:59.

==== Briggs vs. Ibragimov ====

In his first title defense Shannon Briggs was to face Sultan Ibragimov on March 10, 2007; however, Briggs pulled out of the fight because he was diagnosed with &quot;aspiration pneumonia.&quot; The fight was rescheduled fifty days later in Atlantic City on June 2, 2007, with Briggs losing in a unanimous decision 117–111, 119–109, and 115–113. After winning the first round, Briggs slowed down and did not have the aggressiveness, accuracy or stamina to compete with Ibragimov. At 273 pounds, Briggs was as heavy as he had been in his career. Briggs entered having won 12 consecutive fights prior to this and announced his retirement immediately following the bout.

=== Career from 2009–2010 ===
==== Miscellaneous fights ====
Briggs returned in 2009 and scored his twenty-ninth first-round knockout against Marcus McGee. After the bout, Briggs tested positive for a banned substance, and was suspended. The result of the bout was changed to &#x27;No Contest&#x27;. Briggs manager Ivalyo Gotzev, stated Briggs was on medication to control his asthma. &quot;He&#x27;s not a steroid user or a drug user. We&#x27;re consulting with his physicians and seeing how to make the proper adjustments to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen again.&quot; The New York State Athletic Commission suspended Briggs for 90 days. Briggs fought three times in 2010 before fighting Vitali Klitschko. He knocked out Rafael Pedro, Dominique Alexander and Rob Calloway all inside the first round of their respective fights.

==== Briggs vs. Vitali Klitschko ====
On October 16, 2010, Briggs fought for the WBC heavyweight title against Vitali Klitschko in the O2 World at Hamburg, the fight billed as &quot;&#x27;Thunderstorm&quot;&#x27;. During the fight Briggs took a severe beating and after the fight, went down in his quarters. Briggs lost a clear unanimous decision 120–107, 120–107, and 120–105. Brought to a hospital, Briggs was initially treated in intensive care and found to have suffered a left orbital fracture, a broken nose, and a torn left biceps.

=== 2014 comeback ===
After a gap of more than three years, Briggs fought six bouts in 2014 and a further two in 2015. He won all eight, seven by knockout, earning the NABA Heavyweight title in the process.

Briggs fought in Panama against Zoltan Petranyi, knocking him out in round 1. Following the fight, former cruiserweight world champion Guillermo Jones came into the ring to confront Briggs, demanding he fight him next. At this time, Briggs was chasing a fight with then unified and lineal world champion Wladimir Klitschko and told Jones, he would fight him after he fought Klitschko. Neither fight took place in the future. Briggs gained some notoriety over videos he released of himself harassing Klitschko, particularly at sea, as the latter was paddleboarding.

=== Career from 2016–2017 ===

In March 2016, Briggs confronted David Haye at his press conference for the announcement of his fight against little-known Arnold Gjergjaj at the O2 Arena on May 21, 2016. Haye did not agree to fight Briggs immediately but instead offered him the chance to fight on his undercard, promising that he would fight him next if he was victorious. Briggs agreed to this arrangement.

==== Briggs vs. Zarate ====
On May 3, 2016, it was announced that Briggs would fight 6’7-inch former European heavyweight champion, Alexander Dimitrenko (38-2, 27 KOs). His opponent was changed a few days before the fight to Jakov Gospic (17-14, 12 KOs) and then to Emilio Ezequiel Zarate (20-16-3, 11 KOs). Briggs stopped Zarate in the first round of a scheduled 10 round bout with devastating body shots. The fight was stopped at 2:22 of the round. The win for Briggs had meant he could be fighting David Haye next. The card, which was shown live on free-to-air Dave was watched by over 1 million viewers.

Despite winning on the undercard, a fight between Briggs and Haye didn&#x27;t materialize. Brigg&#x27;s continued to call out Haye, asking him to honor his end of the agreement. Briggs also chased Haye down in Brooklyn when both were in attendance for the Frampton vs. Santa Cruz fight. In October, Haye spoke out about the fight not taking place due to the fact that Briggs wanted the fight to be on ppv, “Because the fight can’t happen on pay-per-view ... I like people thinking I’m running from him and ducking him because when I do get in the ring with him, which I really think I will do, I think it will make it a bigger fight. But at the moment the fight can’t happen because he will only fight me if the fight is on pay-per-view. I would fight him on [UK terrestrial channel] DAVE, but he doesn&#x27;t want to do that.”

==== WBA title mix ====
On November 2, 2016, the WBA ordered Briggs to fight Australian heavyweight Lucas Browne for the WBA regular title. The title became vacant after Browne defeated Ruslan Chagaev in March 2016 but was later stripped after he tested positive for drugs. The fight was ordered to take place before the end of 2016. The WBA and Browne came to a legal settlement which said he would fight for a world title next. Browne was due to fight Fres Oquendo, who hadn&#x27;t fought since 2014, however that fight could not be made due to Oquendo recovering from an injury. The WBA ordered the winner of this bout to fight Oquendo in a mandatory defense within 120 days.

On November 22, VADA informed the WBC that Browne had failed a second drug test in the space of six months. After being tested positive for banned substance clenbuterol ahead of his March fight with Ruslan Chagaev, Browne this time tested positive for ostarine, a stamina-increasing substance.

On December 26, 2016 Alexander Ustinov&#x27;s manager Vladimir Hryunov announced that he would be fighting for the WBA &#x27;Regular&#x27; title on February 25, 2017, against either Briggs or Fres Oquendo. Oquendo&#x27;s trainer Nate Jones later confirmed a fight with Briggs was in the works. On January 4, 2017, the WBA ordered for a deal to be reached between Briggs and Oquendo within 30 days or they would force a purse bid. Briggs told Sky Sports he wanted the fight to take place in the UK, after his increasing fan base, mostly due to Briggs spending a lot of time there pursuing a fight with David Haye.

A deal wasn&#x27;t reached by February 2 and the WBA ordered a purse bid to take place on February 13, 2017. Although some promoters were interested in the fight, there were issues raised around the minimum bid of $1 million, being too high. A bid of $400,000 was made by The Heavyweight Factory representative Henry Rivalta, on behalf of Briggs however not being valid due to not meeting the minimum requirement. The WBA ordered another purse bid to take place on February 23.

On February 23, Square Ring Promotions and Hitz Entertainment Corporation announced that a deal had been reached for the Briggs vs. Oquendo fight. CEO of Square Ring Promotions John Wirt told World Boxing News, “We are really excited that we were able to reach an agreement with Kris Lawrence and Henry Rivalta of The Heavyweight Factory.” On March 16, Briggs announced via his Social Media accounts, the fight would take place June 3, 2017 at the Hard Rock Hollywood in Florida. The fight was being billed as &quot;Backyard Brawl&quot;.

==== Cancelled world title fight and ban ====
On May 21, 2017, it was reported that Briggs had failed a drug test. He tested positive for &#x27;dramatically increased levels of testosterone&#x27;. It was revealed that Briggs&#x27; collected sample had almost 8 times the regular amount of testosterone for a man of his age and weight. It was said that the fight would be called off, although no official decision was made. The sample was taken on May 14 and tested on May 16. It was also said that the fight was likely to be postponed after Briggs promoters failed to secure TV rights for the fight. A day later, Hitz Boxing and The Heavyweight Factory announced the fight was officially off and they would not reschedule a new date.

On July 20, 2017, Briggs was suspended for six months by the WBA and is expected to lose his #3 position in the WBA rankings. He will also likely drop out of the top 15.

=== Career from 2019 ===
On March 5, 2019, Briggs announced he would be coming to the UK for a number of &#x27;meet and greets&#x27;. Briggs told Sky Sports that he would be applying for a British boxing license in order to fight in the UK. He claimed he had licensing in the US and would likely appear on Tyson Fury&#x27;s undercard on June 15 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Nevada. On May 15, 2020, Briggs told Dame Dash on Instagram Live that he and Mike Tyson will fight in an exhibition. The preferred date and location was July 4, 2020 at the Statue of Liberty.

After a back and forth over some years, Briggs and former Ultimate Fighting Championship light heavyweight champion Quinton &quot;Rampage&quot; Jackson were aiming to have an exhibition boxing match in 2024.

== K-1 career ==
Briggs competed briefly for the K-1 kickboxing promotion in 2004. In his lone kickboxing match, he knocked out Tom Erikson, a mixed martial artist with a background in collegiate wrestling, just over a minute into round one at the &quot;K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Saitama&quot; in Saitama, Japan on March 27, 2004.

==Outside the ring==
Briggs is also an actor. He made his television acting debut on &quot;New York Undercover&quot; in 1995 and has since appeared in feature films &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, &quot;Transporter 2,&quot; and &quot;The Wackness.&quot;

Briggs also made an appearance on the Fugees&#x27; breakthrough album, &quot;The Score.&quot; He appears in the music video for rapper Thirstin Howl III&#x27;s song &quot;Surrounded By Criminals&quot; (from his 2011 album &quot;Natural Born Skiller&quot;).

Shannon Briggs was summoned to US Federal Court District South Carolina on June 7, 2012, according to court documents Kali Bowyer, Briggs&#x27; ex-publicist, was awarded over $420,000.00 plus interest for her services.

On March 20, 2019, Briggs and Applied BioSciences had agreed a partnership deal. Applied BioSciences, a cannabinoid therapeutics company, focused on medical, bioceutical, testing and pet health industries. Briggs stated, “I have partnered with Applied BioSciences to develop and market Champ Organics because their products are made with the highest quality ingredients and all-natural CBD. I am a firm believer in the benefits that CBD delivers for joint pain and headaches. Since I have incorporated CBD to my daily supplements, I have been surprised by the positive impact it has had on my overall quality of life.”

In the fall of 2019, Shannon Briggs became the trainer for internet superstar Logan Paul for his rematch against fellow internet superstar KSI. The bout went the distance and KSI was awarded the split decision victory. Briggs became a well known figure in the influencer boxing scene, with his catchphrase &quot;let&#x27;s go champ&quot; being the subject of several viral memes.

<doc id="1334852" wikidata="Q721412" url="?curid=1334852" title="Harpocration">
<text>Valerius Harpocration ( or , &quot;gen&quot;. Ἁρποκρατίωνος) was a Greek grammarian of Alexandria, probably working in the 2nd century AD. He is possibly the Harpocration mentioned by Julius Capitolinus (&quot;Life of Verus&quot;, 2) as the Greek tutor of Lucius Verus (2nd century AD); some authorities place him much later, on the ground that he borrowed from Athenaeus. 

Harpocration&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon of the Ten Orators&quot; (Περὶ τῶν Λέξεων τῶν Δέκα Ῥητόρων, or briefly Λεξικὸν τῶν Δέκα Ῥητόρων), which has come down to us in an incomplete form, contains, in more or less alphabetical order, notes on well-known events and persons mentioned by the orators, and explanations of legal and commercial expressions. As nearly all the lexicons to the Greek orators have been lost, Harpocration&#x27;s work is especially valuable. Amongst his authorities were the writers of Atthides (histories of Attica), the grammarian Didymus Chalcenterus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and the lexicographer Dionysius, son of Tryphon. The book also contains contributions to the history of Attic oratory and Greek literature generally. 

The &quot;Collection of Florid Expressions&quot;, a sort of anthology or chrestomathy attributed to him by the &quot;Suda&quot;, is lost, but elements of it survive in later lexica. A series of articles in the margin of a Cambridge manuscript of the &quot;Lexicon&quot; forms the basis of the &quot;Lexicon rhetoricum Cantabrigiense&quot; by Peter Paul Dobree.

<text>Auda Abu Tayeh or Awda Abu Tayih ( 11 January 1874 – 27 December 1924), nicknamed the Commander of the People or the Desert Falcon, was the Sheikh of a section of the Howeitat or Huwaytat tribe of Bedouin Arabs at the time of the Great Arab Revolt during the First World War. The Howeitat lived in what is now Saudi Arabia/Jordan.

Auda led the Arab forces in several battles, the most significant ones being the battle of Aqaba, where he managed to capture the city, seizing the entire Ottoman garrison and the siege of Damascus, when he took the city alongside Faisal.

He died in 1924 and was buried in Amman. He is considered a national hero in Jordan.

In the Arab world, he is seen as a generous and honorable man. However, outside of the Arab world, he is mainly known through his portrayal in British Col. T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s account &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; and from the fictionalised depiction of him in David Lean&#x27;s film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Those accounts, which presented him as a greedy and slick man, were criticized by historians.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Auda was the son of Harb Abu Tayi (? – 1904). He was the fourth among five brothers and one sister and had a rough youth.

When he was young, he learned the Bedouin way of life, grazing herds along the farms first, and later elsewhere as he grew. His mother was particularly tough; during a confrontation with another tribe, Auda, still a child, pursued attackers and killed several. Upon returning to the camp, he found his mother, holding a knife, telling him that if he hadn&#x27;t been brave, she would have cut off the breast that nursed him. As a result of this upbringing, he remained illiterate throughout his life, not knowing how to read or write. However, he had a perfect understanding of Bedouin customary traditions and became a competent Bedouin judge in cases requiring tribal judgments.

He married relatively late, around the age of twenty, which was uncommon in Bedouin society at that time. This is likely due to the fact that he was in love with another woman in his youth, and Harb Abu Tayi, his father, refused to let him marry her because her father was reputed to be a coward. Later, she married another man. Auda married another woman but throughout his life, he sent gifts to this woman. However, he refused to accept her offer of divorcing her husband to marry him when she proposed it later on.

Lawrence recorded that the Jazi Howeitat had formerly been under the leadership of the House of Rashid, the amirs of Ha&#x27;il, but had since fragmented and that Auda had come to control the Eastern Howeitat, known as the abu Tayi. Auda had taken up the claims of his father, Harb abu Tayi (? – 1904), who had contested the tribe&#x27;s chieftainship with Arar ibn Jazi.

Auda and his ibn Jazi rival, Arar&#x27;s half-brother Abtan, diverted the energies of the Howeitat—previously settled farmers and camel herders—into raiding, greatly increasing the tribe&#x27;s wealth but introducing a mainly nomadic lifestyle. Tensions between them and the Ottoman administration had increased after an incident in 1908, when two soldiers were killed who had been sent to demand payment of a tax that Auda claimed to have already paid.

According to historian Mahmoud Obeidat, Auda was the &quot;only person among the tribal leaders whom the Turkish authorities were pursuing, the only person who rejected the decisions of the Turkish administration, and the only person who saw himself as far superior to the Ottoman governor&quot;.

According to Suleiman al-Mousa and Mahmoud Krishan, after killing these two Turkish soldiers, Auda was sought by the police. While secretly heading to Ma&#x27;an to visit a friend, the police received information about his presence and surrounded the house where he was hiding. Unconcerned, he got up, had his breakfast—despite the owner&#x27;s invitations to leave through a back door quickly—and decided to exit through the main door, greeting the Ottoman troops who had come to arrest him. In this way, he managed to evade the Turkish police, who let him pass.

He had three sons, the only surviving one, Muhammad, died in 1987, and it is said that he provided him with a good education in the tribal lifestyle. He had thirteen grandchildren, all of whom live in Jordan.

=== Great Arab revolt ===
At the beginning of the Great Arab Revolt, he joined the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali alongside the Howeitat tribe.

According to several researchers, his and his tribe&#x27;s mobility and knowledge of the desert were significant factors contributing to the success of the Arab Revolt and stood out as one of their assets. He and his tribesmen were lead forces in the fall of Aqaba (July 1917) and Damascus (October 1918).

Auda abu Tayi is considered a hero of the Arab revolt. In reward for his services rendered, he received a sword from the hands of Hussein as a token of friendship.

About his role in the Great Arab Revolt, he declared:In my body, there are twenty-two wounds, the most cherished of which are the last wounds, which were for the glory of the Arabs. I will not hesitate to offer what remains of my intact body to my nation and people, and I swear to Allah, what I say is a sacrifice.He managed to take Aleppo, in the last days of World War I.

=== Post-war years ===
He continued raiding, for example, in 1921, he tried to do a raid in Iraq, engaging in a march of more than 600km in the desert. However, the expedition resulted in a disaster after their enemies spotted them near their arrival point and started depleting all water supplies, destroying the whole expedition except a small dozen of tribesmen, including Auda and his son Muhammad.

He was very shocked by the Franco-British occupation of Arab lands. He then helped the ephemeral army of Hashemite Syria, led by Faisal. After the collapse of the Arab government in Damascus, which was invaded by France, Auda retired to the desert, building a modern fort at Al-Jafr east of Ma&#x27;an with Turkish prisoners of war. Before it was completed, however, he died in 1924 of natural causes. He was buried in Ras al-Ain, Amman, Jordan.

Nowadays, only ruins remain of his building due to it being in the desert and not receiving heritage care and restoration.

=== Name ===
His full genealogy was, in .

He received the nicknames of &quot;Commander of the People&quot; and of &quot;Desert Falcon&quot;.

==Legacy==
=== Historical legacy ===
He was presented by some people, on the account of the movie, and to a lesser extent on the book of Lawrence of Arabia as being a sly and greedy individual. Much of this modern-day presentation seems rooted in his sensationalised depiction by Lowell Thomas as a figure of anarchic, primitive masculine energy deliberately set against the idea of British &#x27;civilisation&#x27; (see also Orientalism).

However, historians have criticized these accounts of Auda as misrepresenting Arabs and Auda.

=== Political legacy ===
He is considered a national figure by the Jordanian people.

=== Artistical legacy ===

==== Literature ====
He is an important figure in Lawrence&#x27;s semi-fictionalized account of the Arab Revolt, &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, which misrepresents him and the Arab people as romanticized figures. T. E. Lawrence portrayed him as someone who epitomized everything noble, powerful, and proud about the Bedouin, &quot;the greatest fighting man in northern Arabia,&quot; with an impressive lineage spanning many generations of great desert Howeitat warriors of the Arabian Peninsula.

He was described as a generous man by Khayr al-Din al-Zirikli in one of his books and by Abdal Fattah al-Yaffi.in his &quot;Memories.&quot;

==== Cinema ====
He was portrayed in the David Lean film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; by Anthony Quinn, which included various stereotypes against Arabs and his figure. Auda&#x27;s descendants were so incensed by the portrayal of their ancestor that they sued Columbia Studios, the film&#x27;s producers; the case was eventually dropped.

Auda was also featured as a supporting character in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s Lawrence-themed play &quot;Ross&quot;.

He is also portrayed in 2009 Qatari film &quot;Auda abu Tayeh&quot;, which talks about his life in Arabia to Arab Revolt, and his death. In 2008, there was also a series about him produced and filmed in Jordan.

<doc id="1334870" wikidata="Q2096948" url="?curid=1334870" title="River Tyburn">
<text>The River Tyburn was a stream () in London, England. Its main successor sewers emulate its main courses, but it resembled the Colne in its county of Middlesex in that it had many distributaries (inland mouths). It ran from South Hampstead, through Marylebone, Mayfair, St James&#x27;s parish/district and Green Park to meet the tidal Thames at four sites, grouped into pairs. These pairs were near Whitehall Stairs (east of Downing Street), and by Thorney Street, between Millbank Tower and Thames House. Its much smaller cousin, the Tyburn Brook, was a tributary of the Westbourne and the next Thames tributary (west, on the north bank).

==Name==
A charter of AD 959 appears to mention the river, which it refers to as &quot;Merfleot&quot;, which probably translates as &quot;Boundary Stream&quot;, a suggestion reinforced by context, with the river forming the western boundary of the estate described. It is also mentioned in Edgar&#x27;s Charter, dating from AD 951, where it is rendered as &quot;Teo-burna&quot;, a name which is thought to mean &quot;two-burn&quot;. This may refer to the two branches of the Tyburn which passed through Marylebone and converged to the north of Oxford Street. Ekwall, writing in 1928, suggested that the name meant boundary stream as it followed a course between Lilestone manor and Tyburn manor, but this is now questioned, as both of the river banks were in Tyburn manor.

The Tyburn is also known as the Aye and the Kings Scholars Pond Sewer, though it has to be remembered that the word &quot;sewer&quot; originally referred to an open channel used for the drainage of surface water, and it was illegal to pollute them with offensive material prior to 1815.

==Course==
Before it was culverted then used as a sewer, this brook rose from the confluence of two streams in the hills of South Hampstead, deriving from the broad ravine between Barrow and Primrose Hills. Its main source was the Shepherd&#x27;s Well near Fitzjohns Avenue, Hampstead. At Green Park, the waters split into distributaries, creating Thorney Island on which Westminster Abbey was built. As the map shows, these again split in two, one in the then lower, thus typically Spring tide immersed bank, where Whitehall sits, the other close to Vincent Square, Pimlico, Westminster. The river&#x27;s current path is fully enclosed by concrete, bricks, parks and roads, flowing through underground conduits for its entire length, including one beneath Buckingham Palace. Several streets, including Marylebone Lane, Jason Court, Gees Court, South Molton Lane then Bruton Lane, defy the grid system of streets as the streets follow the former path of the Tyburn on what was its left bank through Marylebone village. Most of its catchment drains into soakaways in gravel soil, in turn into the chalk water table beneath or into the two-type and hybrid type of drainage set out in Victorian London. In the Tyburn&#x27;s depression run key (lateral) sewers which connect to Bazalgette&#x27;s west-to-east Interceptor sewers. 

From its source at the Shepherd&#x27;s Well near Fitzjohns Avenue in Hampstead its successor is Scholar&#x27;s Pond Sewer southward along that avenue through the Swiss Cottage part of South Hampstead under Avenue Road to Regent&#x27;s Park. To enter the park&#x27;s perimeter the part-foul (combined) run is carried enpiped over the Regent&#x27;s Canal then culverted.

The Tyburn gave its name to the former area of Tyburn, a manor of Marylebone, which was recorded in Domesday Book and which stood approximately at the west end of what is now Oxford Street, where from late medieval times until the 18th century traitors were left following hanging at Tyburn Gallows. Tyburn gave its name to the predecessors of Oxford Street and Park Lane—Tyburn Road and Tyburn Lane, respectively.
Grays Antique Centre near the junction of Oxford Street and Davies Street claims that the body of water which can be seen in an open conduit in the basement of its premises is part of the Tyburn; it is undoubtedly close to the culverted course of the stream. The &quot;Londonist&quot; website describes this suggestion as &quot;fanciful&quot;, as the modern Tyburn is a sewer.

The stream&#x27;s southward route followed Lansdowne Row, the north-east of Curzon Street then White Horse Street and the pedestrian avenue of Green Park to the front gates of Buckingham Palace (foot of Constitution Hill) from where one mouth used the depression of St James&#x27;s Park Lake and Downing Street to reach two close-paired mouths. A third distributary is untraced in the building lines and street layout to Thorney Street close to Lambeth Bridge, whilst a fourth distributary forms the natural collect for a sewer pipe, King&#x27;s Scholar&#x27;s Pond Sewer, to the Victoria Embankment interceptor, saving it from discharging west of Vauxhall Bridge.

==Maintenance==
The Kings Scholars Pond Sewer was constructed between 1848 and 1856. When the Metropolitan Line was constructed in the early 1860s, it used cut and cover techniques to excavate the tunnels for the underground railway. At Baker Street station, the railway passed beneath the Kings Scholars Pond Sewer, which was supported by a bridge structure attached to the side walls of the tunnel. By the late 2010s, the bridge and sewer had settled below their original level by , and were encroaching on the space needed by the trains. Thames Water, who own the sewer, looked at ways to rectify the problem. Three options were considered. The first involved replacing the bridge and strengthening the walls of the tunnel, but this would have involved closing the railway for three months, at a cost of some £30 million, in addition to the cost of the work. Above the sewer there were reinforced concrete slabs, thought to have been installed during the Second World War, and the second option was to hang a new structure from these. However, further investigation showed that the slabs were not sufficiently robust for this to be safe.

The solution adopted was to construct a Vierendeel truss within the existing sewer, fitted with a glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) liner. The entire structure was made of small modular parts, which could be fitted through a access hole. When assembled, the structure would be longer than the railway tunnel width, so that its ends were supported by ground beyond the tunnel walls. Once all the components had been manufactured, installation work began in June 2018, and continued until October 2018. The scheme was managed by a joint venture comprising Skanska, MWH Treatment, and Balfour Beatty (SMB JV), with Stantec UK Ltd as a designer and McAllister Group carrying out the on-site work. The steel truss is expected to last for 120 years without maintenance, while the GFRP liner has a life span of 50 years. The innovative nature of the solution resulted in the project being given a commendation by the Institution of Structural Engineers in 2021.

<doc id="1334877" wikidata="Q544747" url="?curid=1334877" title="Minbo">
<text>is a 1992 Japanese film by filmmaker Juzo Itami. It is also known by the titles Minbo: the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion, The Gangster&#x27;s Moll and The Anti-Extortion Woman. The film was widely popular in Japan and a critical success internationally. It satirizes the yakuza, who retaliated for their portrayal in the film by attacking the director.

==Plot summary==
The owner of a high-class Japanese hotel, the Europa, hopes to win a prestigious and lucrative contract for the hotel as the site of a summit meeting between important international officials. Unfortunately, the yakuza have taken a liking to this hotel as both a hangout and a target for extortion. In order to win the contract, the owner realizes, he must rid the hotel of the yakuza. Fearing to confront them himself, he deputizes a hotel accountant, Suzuki (Yasuo Daichi) and a bellboy and former college sumo-club member, Wakasugi (Takehiro Murata). The hapless pair are no more daring than their employer, however, and their tentative attempts to address the problem fail until they meet Mahiru Inoue (Nobuko Miyamoto), a lawyer who specializes in dealing with the yakuza. With Inoue&#x27;s direction, the hotel staff comes together to face down the yakuza ruffians, who are portrayed as craven, outwardly-threatening-but-inwardly-weak, fools.

==Definition of &quot;minbo&quot;==
The word &quot;minbo&quot; is a contraction of &quot;minji kainyū bōryoku&quot; (民事介入暴力), literally translated as &quot;violent intervention in civil affairs&quot;. It was a technique utilized by the yakuza following the crackdown of traditionally &quot;victimless&quot; crimes of drugs, gambling, and prostitution in the early 1980s, and exploited the Japanese reluctance towards confrontation in order to &quot;gently extort&quot; money from otherwise innocent individuals by making a scene with implied threats of violence over trivial matters.

==Attack against Juzo Itami==
The yakuza, who prefer to think of themselves as something akin to modern-day samurai, were angered by their portrayal in &quot;Minbo&quot; as common thugs and bullies. Three knife-wielding members of the Goto-gumi yakuza gang attacked director Juzo Itami near his home on May 22, 1992, six days after the movie opened. Itami was beaten and had his face slashed. The brutality of the attack, combined with Itami&#x27;s popularity and the success of &quot;Minbo&quot;, led to a public outcry and a government crackdown against yakuza activity.

<doc id="1334884" wikidata="Q6390093" url="?curid=1334884" title="Kenneth Fearing">
<text>Kenneth Flexner Fearing (July 28, 1902 – June 26, 1961) was an American poet and novelist. A major poet of the Depression era, he addressed the shallowness and consumerism of American society as he saw it, often by ironically adapting the language of commerce and media. Critics have associated him with the American Left to varying degrees; his poetry belongs to the American proletarian poetry movement, but is rarely overtly political. Fearing published six original collections of poetry between 1929 and 1956. He wrote his best-known poems during the late 1920s and 1930s. 

He moved from Illinois to New York City in 1924, and spent the rest of his life there. He supported himself by writing pulp fiction, often under pseudonyms. Around 1939 he began to write novels and wrote less poetry. His seven novels are mystery and thriller stories with some unconventional characteristics. They often feature many characters who are given one or more chapters from their point of view, and in a few later novels he used fictional newspaper articles and radio transcripts to further the narrative. His most famous novel, &quot;The Big Clock&quot;, has remained in print since its 1946 publication and was adapted for film.

==Personal biography==
Fearing was born in Oak Park, Illinois, to a successful family: his father was Harry Lester Fearing (d. 1940), a successful Chicago attorney and descendant of the family of Calvin Coolidge. His mother Olive Flexner Fearing was of Jewish descent and a cousin of the educator Abraham Flexner. His parents divorced when he was a year old, and they each had custody of him six months of the year. He was raised mainly by his aunt, Eva Fearing Scholl, in the other half of a duplex that the Fearings owned and lived in. He had a half-sister Ethel (b. 1916) and a half-brother Ralph (b. 1918). Fearing went to school at Oak Park and River Forest High School, where he was voted &quot;wittiest boy and class pessimist&quot;. He was the editor of the student newspaper, a position previously held by Ernest Hemingway. He studied English at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1920–1922) and the University of Wisconsin (1922–1924). At the latter, he became editor-in-chief of the school&#x27;s literary magazine, but was forced to resign in part for his acceptance of Modernist writing and other controversial material. He left without graduating, being one class short of a degree. In 1938 the University of Wisconsin awarded him the degree &quot;in absentia&quot;; presumably the school wanted to recognize his fame.

As a young man Fearing was thin, with dark hair and skin, and liked to wear dark suits. His voice was low and lispy. He had a &quot;little-boy appeal&quot;, with messy hair and habits, horn-rimmed glasses, and an immature disposition—some of which may be seen in Alice Neel&#x27;s oil portrait, painted in 1935, which is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The portrait includes some references to Fearing&#x27;s poetry and shows a small skeleton in his chest, grasping his heart and pouring blood from it; Neel commented that &quot;He really sympathized with humanity ... His heart bled for the grief of the world.&quot; After his death, according to Robert M. Ryley, friends remembered &quot;his charm, his eloquence, his almost courtly manners, his prickly independence, his not-quite-hidden vulnerability and innocence—but mostly they would remember his gloomy, sardonic skepticism&quot;.

During the late 1920s he had a romantic relationship with the writer and activist Margery Latimer, whom he met at Wisconsin. (Latimer&#x27;s roman à clef &quot;This Is My Body&quot; includes a character based on Fearing.) Fearing cheated on Latimer and never proposed to her; she rejected his later attempt to renew their relationship. In 1931, he met Rachel Meltzer, a nurse by training and a medical social worker. Fearing was poor at expressing affection in person (if not in his letters) and less interested in marriage than Meltzer. She later said of her husband, &quot;Kenneth spent his whole life hiding his inner self from other people&quot;; &quot;[he] needed someone to take care of him.&quot; They were married on April 26, 1933, and their son, Bruce Fearing, was born on July 19, 1935. The family soon travelled to Europe for nine months thanks to the $2,500 that came with Kenneth&#x27;s 1935 Guggenheim Fellowship. Partly due to Fearing&#x27;s growing alcoholism, he and Rachel divorced in 1941, with Rachel having custody of their son. 

He stayed at the Yaddo artists&#x27; retreat for the first time in 1938 and returned often. At Yaddo he began a relationship with the painter Nan Lurie and they married on June 18, 1945. In this period his drinking became dangerous to his health, which scared him into temperance. Nan found him duller as a result, and their relationship suffered. They separated in 1952. This was his last marriage.

Fearing lacked money for much of his life (the period following his most successful novel was the exception). In New York, he received a monthly allowance from his mother until 1935, when she decided that her son should bear full responsibility for his new child. His mother had been skeptical of his choice of writing career.) He also relied on gifts from his father and loans from Latimer in those years. He held few full-time jobs for more than a few months, despite claiming, apparently falsely, to have worked as a salesman, a journalist, and even a lumberjack in press materials. In the 1950s, he worked for the &quot;Books&quot; section of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine (1952–1954), and, during his single longest period of employment, he developed press material and annual reports for the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America (1955–1958). Still, he lived in poverty in the 1950s, and had smoked and drank heavily for most of his life, which seriously affected his health in his last years. In early 1961, he felt a sharp pain in his back that worsened through June, when his son Bruce moved in to care for him. They went to Lenox Hill Hospital on June 21, and five days later Fearing died of a melanoma of his left chest and pleural cavity. He is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

==Literary career==
In December 1924, Fearing moved to New York City, joining Latimer, where he pursued a writing career. His friend the poet Horace Gregory noted that his early writing was not particularly successful, but Fearing was particularly determined to make a living in writing. His early work was commercial, including stories for pulp magazines, and he often wrote under pseudonyms. He wrote sex-pulp novels at half a cent a word, which were published under the pseudonym Kirk Wolff. Meanwhile, he searched for editors who would publish his poetry. 

Fearing told a writers&#x27; convention in 1948 that &quot;Literature is a means for crystallizing the myths under which society lives.&quot; His poetic influences included Walt Whitman, who he said was &quot;the first writer to create a technique indigenous to the whole of this country&#x27;s outlook&quot;, and François Villon, John Keats, and Edwin Arlington Robinson. He enjoyed Maurice Ravel and the painter George Grosz. His early poems were published in magazines such as &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the &quot;New Masses&quot;, &quot;Free Verse&quot;, &quot;Voices&quot;, and &quot;The Menorah Journal&quot;. About 44 of his poems were published before his first book of poetry came out. He was involved in the formation of the League of American Writers in 1935 and worked for its national council in the first year. He participated in the Federal Writers&#x27; Project during the Depression, and in 1939 he taught at the New York Writers School. 

===Poetry===
Fearing&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Angel Arms&quot; (1929), was dedicated to Margery Latimer and had an introduction by Edward Dahlberg. The next book, &quot;Poems&quot; (1935), was a success and won him the first of two Guggenheim Fellowships (the fellowship was renewed in 1939). These two volumes contain some of his best-known poems, such as &quot;Jack Knuckles Falters&quot;, &quot;1935&quot;, &quot;X Minus X&quot;, and &quot;Dirge&quot;. 

He published five original poetry collections; the remaining three are &quot;Dead Reckoning: A Book of Poetry&quot; (1938), &quot;Afternoon of a Pawnbroker and Other Poems&quot; (1943), and &quot;Stranger at Coney Island and Other Poems&quot; (1948). While his early poetry was well received, critics began to find his work repetitive in the 1940s. He was first anthologized in &quot;Collected Poems of Kenneth Fearing&quot; (1940). Fearing was most productive, and his future most bright, between 1938 and 1943, when he published a book of poetry or a novel each year. Even then, his royalties during this period were minimal, and only exceeded the publisher&#x27;s advance on two occasions (the &quot;Collected Poems&quot; and the novel &quot;The Hospital&quot;). Despite the fame, he remained dependent on his wife Rachel&#x27;s income.

====Poetic themes and style====
His poetry is concerned with &quot;a society that was morally bankrupt and ... sapped by the economic and political maneuvers necessary to support the American ideal of &#x27;getting ahead&#x27;&quot;. The characters in many of his poems are &quot;types&quot;, and the effects of commerce and consumerism on the psyche are presented as if typical to everyone. The narrator is often superficially dispassionate, an ironic surveyor of the scene, but may reveal anger in the form of &quot;sarcasm, contemptuous reductiveness, caricature, cartoony distortion, mocking hyperbole&quot;. 

In &quot;Dirge&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;), a successful &quot;executive type&quot; eventually loses his status via setbacks—&quot;nevertheless, they shut off his gas; nevertheless, the / bank foreclosed; nevertheless, the landlord called&quot;—and dies by suicide. The poem ironically intersperses comic-book language in its otherwise emotionless recounting: &quot;And wow he died as wow he lived, / going whop to the office and blooie home to sleep and / biff got married and bam had children and oof got fired, / zowie did he live and zowie did he die&quot;. This effect, according to Nathaniel Mills, &quot;indicates the manner in which mass culture works to deaden the sensory reality of pain ... For the reader, the aesthetic response of disorientation, unexpected excitement, or shock prompts a critical reflection: what sort of cultural and political formation could cheapen experience to the extent of rendering an obituary as &#x27;zowie did he live and zowie did he die?&#x27;&quot;

The language of mass media similarly intrudes in &quot;Jack Knuckles Falters&quot; (1926), in which a war veteran has been sentenced to death for murder. In his final words, he struggles with his competing needs to proclaim his innocence and meet his death with &quot;dignity&quot;. Newspaper headlines that cover his execution interrupt each stanza and undermine his speech: &quot;&quot; They convey nothing of his personal struggle but rather satisfy the public&#x27;s need for a simple narrative in which a &quot;criminal&quot; is punished. The headline has moved on to another topic as the man proclaims his innocence. According to the poet Mark Halliday, &quot;Fearing in 1926 (before television, before the Internet) is not calling for some practical redesigning of news delivery; he is asking his reader to think about the psychological effect of the simultaneous availability of countless bits of information, all formatted for quick-snack consumption.&quot;

Fearing commonly uses a particular syntax, which Halliday describes as an &quot;anaphoric elaboration of a subordinate clause that waits in limbo for its controlling statement to arrive&quot;. This delay can be &quot;a way of representing a life which people mostly can&#x27;t shape for themselves, a world of people who can&#x27;t be the agents of their experience and mostly live subordinated to great mysterious forces&quot;. The first two stanzas of &quot;X Minus X&quot; (from &quot;Poems&quot;) illustrate this style:

===Fiction===
As the critical reception of his poetry declined into the 1940s—Halliday suggests that Fearing &quot;seems to have felt increasingly jaded and skeptical about poetry&#x27;s chance to participate in public life&quot;—Fearing turned to novels. Between 1939 and 1960 he wrote seven mystery or &quot;thriller&quot; novels, although their formal qualities defy simple genre categorization. The most significant are &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1939), &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot; (1941), &quot;Clark Gifford&#x27;s Body&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1946).

Fearing was well known in 1939, and his first novel, &quot;The Hospital&quot;, quickly sold six thousand copies. A power outage at a hospital, caused by a drunk janitor, is the central event around which numerous characters&#x27; lives are portrayed. Each chapter is devoted to one character&#x27;s point of view, a style common to all of Fearing&#x27;s novels. The novel was criticized for the large number of characters and their lack of depth, a complaint that continued throughout Fearing&#x27;s fiction career. Critics, however, praised its crisp prose style—one called it a &quot;staccato prose poem&quot;—and its portrayal of lower-class characters like the janitor. &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot; (1941) is a psychological thriller in which there is a murder at an art colony. The creation of suspense from states of mind (via interior monologue) rather than physical violence was a departure from most novels of its type. &quot;Clark Gifford&#x27;s Body&quot; (1942) recounts a revolution in an unnamed country that begins with the title character&#x27;s attack on a radio station. It has more than twenty characters, moves back and forth in time, and inserts contradictory radio and newspaper accounts of events. The novel&#x27;s experimental aspects and pessimism were not met well by readers.

He worked for 14 months on his most well-known novel, &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1946), whose protagonist, an editor for a crime magazine, is put in charge of a murder investigation by his boss—but both men had had a relationship with the murdered woman. The novel was more successful than his prior efforts artistically and commercially, with an engaging plot and more character depth. Alan M. Wald, an historian of the American Left, calls it &quot;a psychosexual &quot;roman noir&quot; stressing the sinister effect of market segmentation in the publishing industry&quot;. It was critically well-received, and was popular enough that a Bantam paperback and an Armed Services Edition soon followed. It remains in print. The novel was developed into a film of the same name in 1948, and again in 1987 (&quot;No Way Out&quot;). The novel earned Fearing $60,000 from republication and film rights. His financial success was short-lived, as income from the novel dried up due to the unfavorable contracts that he had negotiated himself.

Wald summarizes the &quot;frightening and fragmented hollowness&quot; that Fearing saw in post-war US society and depicted in &quot;The Big Clock&quot;:

In &quot;Loneliest Girl in the World&quot; (1951), an audio recording and storage device named &quot;Mikki&quot; is at the center of a mystery. Ellen Vaughn, the daughter of its inventor, uses the machine&#x27;s &quot;463,635 hours of recorded speeches, music, and business transactions&quot; to determine the circumstances of her father&#x27;s death. She finds a recording in which her father and his brother argue about the best way to exploit &quot;Mikki&quot;, which Ellen ultimately destroys with a gun. The story is unusual in that the mystery is resolved with retrieved information rather than &quot;detection&quot;.

&quot;The Crozart Story&quot; (1960) is about the heads of two rival public relations firms. Fearing has one PR head explain how he shaped public opinion: &quot;The fantasies we were adroitly joining and fashioning into loaded rumors, those gossamer rumors we were transmuting into triggered press releases, those childlike releases we were everywhere implementing with public degradation, internal exile, imprisonment, those incandescent anxieties we were molding and hardening into death&#x27;s-head taboos—all these components of the commando raids we were mounting for the world&#x27;s richest haul consisted of words, basically, only words.&quot; The novel was abstract and lacking in plot, and its reception was poor. It did not earn enough to pay Fearing&#x27;s advance. Critics state that Fearing&#x27;s two last novels, particularly &quot;The Crozart Story&quot;, are more like unfinished sketches in places, and are suggestive of his declining motivation to write, his declining health due to alcoholism, or both.

===Politics===
Accounts vary as to Fearing&#x27;s degree of association with Marxism and the American Left. Marxists courted him and suggested that he contribute to periodicals like the &quot;New Masses&quot;, which he did, beginning in 1926, and he was a contributing editor there from 1930 to 1933. He was a founding member of the John Reed Club in 1929, where he was on the editorial board of the communist &quot;Partisan Review&quot;; he is commonly included among its cofounders after the magazine repositioned itself as anti-Stalinist. He put his name to various pro-Soviet declarations from 1931 through to the 1939 &quot;Open Letter of the 400&quot;, which defended Stalin&#x27;s regime.

Yet Fearing&#x27;s poems were almost never overtly political, and his associates often found him uncommitted to communism. He told the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; in 1938, &quot;I&#x27;ve not tried deliberately to be Marxist in my poetry ... Marxism is valuable in literature only to the extent that the writer assimilates it. Consequently its principles become part of a writer&#x27;s background, the way he thinks and feels and interprets it.&quot; Fearing&#x27;s family maintained that &quot;politics was never an important part of his life&quot;. His son Bruce said that his father &quot;&quot;used&quot; a leftist political milieu to get his poetry published; he didn&#x27;t believe in politics, he believed in poetry&quot;. As a Jew, a pacifist, and an anti-fascist, Fearing was uncomfortable with the American Communist Party&#x27;s support of the Hitler-Stalin pact in 1939. (As a child, Fearing witnessed the &quot;reflexive anti-semitism&quot; of his father towards his wife&#x27;s family.) The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact prompted him to write a poem, &quot;Pact&quot;, which was published in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; that year and contained hints to his allies that he was breaking rank. Wald writes that Fearing had &quot;a mistrust of all political premises and a disbelief in all ameliorative options, [which] ran contrary to any connection with a large organization that demanded ideological conformity and an activist commitment&quot;. In the era of McCarthyism his political associations were sufficient for him to be interviewed by the FBI and called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The FBI reported that &quot;[Fearing said] he had become a &#x27;fellow traveler&#x27; in 1933, and that prior to that time he had not been very interested in the meetings of the John Reed Club due to the fact that he was not interested in the politics discussed at all the meetings.&quot; Before the Committee in 1950, when asked if he was a member of the Communist Party, Fearing replied, &quot;Not yet.&quot;

==Legacy==
The literary critic Macha Rosenthal called Fearing &quot;the chief poet of the American Depression&quot;. He influenced the Beat poets, such as Allen Ginsberg. Alan Filreis writes that Fearing&#x27;s &quot;demotic, chatty, antic, digressive style made Ginsberg possible&quot;, and Fearing&#x27;s contemporary Marya Zaturenska said of Ginsberg, &quot;isn&#x27;t 3/4 of him straight out of Kenneth Fearing?&quot;

Since Fearing&#x27;s death, critics have offered more positive appraisals of his later poetry. In a 1970 article on the &quot;Dynamo&quot; school of poets, Estelle Novak wrote, &quot;Fearing&#x27;s true appeal as a revolutionary poet was his ability to combine realistic description and political comment in the form of a readable poem that lost nothing of its quality as poem while it gained in propaganda value.&quot; By the 1990s there was a &quot;minor revival&quot;, with the National Poetry Foundation&#x27;s publication of &quot;Kenneth Fearing Complete Poems&quot; in 1994, and the poet Mark Halliday published an essay, &quot;Damned Good Poet: Kenneth Fearing&quot; (2001), which included an analysis of the poet&#x27;s themes. A selection of Fearing&#x27;s poems has been published as part of the Library of America&#x27;s American Poets Project.

<doc id="1334892" wikidata="Q45146" url="?curid=1334892" title="Dominik Duka">
<text>Dominik Jaroslav Duka, O.P. (born 26 April 1943) is a Czech prelate of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Prague from 2010 to 2022. He was made a cardinal in 2012. 

Duka served as Bishop of Hradec Králové from 1998 to 2010. He was the spiritual protector and chaplain general of the &quot;Orléans obedience&quot; of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem from 2012 to 2021.

==Early years==
Duka was born on 26 April 1943 in Hradec Králové in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now in the Czech Republic). His father was an army officer who fought for the allied forces in World War II, based at RAF Cosford, who was later imprisoned in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. Duka graduated from Tyl Grammar School in Hradec Králové in 1960 and worked in a factory and as an apprentice locksmith before entering military service from 1962 to 1964.

On 6 January 1969 he made his temporary profession as a member of the Dominicans and on 22 June 1970 he was ordained a priest by Cardinal Štěpán Trochta, Bishop of Litoměřice. For five years he worked in parishes of the Archdiocese of Prague and, on 7 January 1972, he made his solemn profession as a Dominican.

In 1975, the Communist government of Czechoslovakia revoked Duka&#x27;s authorization to work as a priest. From then until the regime collapsed in 1989, Duka worked as a designer at the Škoda factory in Plzeň. At the same time he continued to work secretly as a Dominican and was elected Vicar Provincial, serving from 1975 until 1987. From 1976 to 1981, he taught theology to seminarians at the Theological Faculty of Litoměřice. In 1979, he obtained a licentiate in theology at the Theological Faculty of St. John the Baptist in Warsaw, Poland.

As a result of his activities with the Dominicans and his involvement in the publication of unauthorised samizdat literature, he was imprisoned in Bory Prison in Plzeň from 1981 to 1982, where his fellow prisoners included future Czech President Václav Havel. While in prison, Duka conducted a clandestine mass for other prisoners disguised as a chess club. From 1986 to 1998 he was Prior Provincial of the Dominicans in Bohemia and Moravia. From 1990 to 1998, he was a lecturer in the Faculty of Theology at Palacký University in Olomouc, teaching Introduction to Sacred Scripture and biblical anthropology.

Duka was elected to a three-year term as president of the Conference of Major Superiors of the Czech Republic in 1989. From 1992 to 1996 he was vice president of the Union of European Conferences of Major Superiors.

==Bishop==
On 6 June 1998 Duka was appointed bishop of Hradec Králové. He received episcopal consecration on 26 September 1998. On 13 February 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Archbishop of Prague. Duka was installed in Prague&#x27;s St. Vitus Cathedral. On his appointment, Duka said:
One of Duka&#x27;s chief concerns was the long-standing issue of the restitution of church property, which had been confiscated by the communist regime and which was either never fully returned or for which the church never received compensation. The Czech Republic is one of the last countries in Europe not to have ratified a treaty with the Holy See. After previous attempts at an agreement had failed –most notably in 2008 under Cardinal Miloslav Vlk –the Czech government in mid-January 2012 agreed to a compensation plan, under which the country&#x27;s seventeen churches, both Catholic and Protestant, would get 56% of their former property now held by the state, an amount estimated at 75 billion koruna ($3.7 billion), and another 59 billion koruna ($2.9 billion) in financial compensation paid over the next thirty years. The state will also gradually stop covering the churches&#x27; expenses over the next seventeen years.

On 23 December 2011, Duka presided at the funeral liturgy of Václav Havel.

==Cardinal==
On 18 February 2012, Duka was made cardinal priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro.
On 21 April 2012, he was appointed a member of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.

Duka was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis.

Duka contributed to a book &quot;Eleven Cardinals Speak on Marriage and the Family&quot; which urged fellow church leaders to maintain the church&#x27;s rules regarding marriage and strengthen Catholic education about marriage and family life. The book was released before the world Synod of Bishops on the family in October 2015.

In May 2016, Duka claimed that the pope could not fully understand the refugee crisis because he is not from Europe. Duka has frequently spoken against Muslim immigration into Europe and has said that Muslims can only be considered a &quot;safe presence&quot; if they make up less than five percent of the population.

Duka has had several clashes with Templeton winner Tomáš Halík. In August 2015, Duka banned a conference by Jeannine Gramick, an American nun specialising in pastoral care for LGBT people, as well as the screening of a Polish film about a homosexual priest. In a statement setting out his objections, Duka said: &quot;Most participants are not believers and have no intention of addressing their relationship with the Church. Since I do not think people with this sexual orientation are discriminated against in our country, it is not right for us to advocate things which are in direct conflict with the Catholic Church’s teachings.&quot;

In 2016, Halík criticized Duka for allegedly dissociating himself from the pope and for being too close to the Czech president Miloš Zeman. They disagree on Islam and its &quot;violent tendencies&quot;. Halík also criticized Duka in October 2016, for accepting the highest state award from President Miloš Zeman, telling &quot;Právo&quot;: &quot;On the 28 October national holiday, when Miloš Zeman was bestowing a medal on Dominik Duka for his support for Miloš Zeman, I remembered the words a former Pope, who commented on the death of Cardinal Richelieu — He said if God exists, the cardinal will probably have a lot to explain to him; if God does not exist, the cardinal did his job perfectly. I would be ashamed to accept an award from Miloš Zeman. However, Cardinal Duka seems to have got on a train he will never have the courage to leave. This makes me sorry.&quot;

In February 2018, a group of Czech Catholic laymen wrote a letter to Pope Francis, expressing concern about Duka&#x27;s closeness to Czech politicians including Václav Klaus, Miloš Zeman and Tomio Okamura, and urging him not to extend Duka&#x27;s term as archbishop when he submitted his resignation as required upon turning 75 in April 2018.

On 13 May 2022, Pope Francis accepted his resignation as archbishop.

<text>Rubellius Blandus was a Roman, native of Tibur (Tivoli, Italy). He was the first Equestrian of Ancient Rome to teach rhetoric and thus made it more respectable (Sen., Controv. 2, 5). He was the teacher of Papirius Fabianus, who was in turn the teacher of Seneca the Younger. His grandson Gaius Rubellius Blandus was a suffect consul of 18.

<text>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the methyl cycle, and it is encoded by the &quot;MTHFR&quot; gene. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Natural variation in this gene is common in otherwise healthy people. Although some variants have been reported to influence susceptibility to occlusive vascular disease, neural tube defects, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other forms of dementia, colon cancer, and acute leukemia, findings from small early studies have not been reproduced. Some mutations in this gene are associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Complex I deficiency with recessive spastic paraparesis has also been linked to &quot;MTHFR&quot; variants. In addition, the aberrant promoter hypermethylation of this gene is associated with male infertility and recurrent spontaneous abortion.

== Biochemistry ==
In the rate-limiting step of the methyl cycle, MTHFR irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (substrate) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (product).
* 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is used to convert dUMP to dTMP for &quot;de novo&quot; thymidine synthesis.
* 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate is used to convert homocysteine (a potentially toxic amino acid) to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase. (Note that homocysteine can also be converted to methionine by the folate-independent enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT).)

MTHFR contains a bound flavin cofactor and uses NAD(P)H as the reducing agent.

== Structure ==

Mammalian MTHFR is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. MTHFR has at least two promoters and two isoforms (70 kDa and 77 kDa).

== Regulation ==

MTHFR activity may be inhibited by binding of dihydrofolate (DHF) and &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (SAM, or AdoMet). MTHFR can also be phosphorylated – this decreases its activity by ~20% and allows it to be more easily inhibited by SAM.
== Genetics ==

The enzyme is coded by the gene with the symbol &quot;MTHFR&quot; on chromosome 1 location p36.3 in humans. There are DNA sequence variants (genetic polymorphisms) associated with this gene.
In 2000 a report brought the number of polymorphisms up to 24.
Two of the most investigated are C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

While multiple published studies have drawn relationships between these SNPs and a wide variety of diseases, the American College of Medical Genetics has issued an official Practice Guideline recommending against testing or reporting on these two variants, citing &quot;Recent meta-analyses have disproven an association between hyperhomocysteinemia and risk for coronary heart disease and between MTHFR polymorphism status and risk for venous thromboembolism. There is growing evidence that MTHFR polymorphism testing has minimal clinical utility.&quot;

=== C677T SNP (Ala222Val) ===
The MTHFR nucleotide at position 677 in the gene has two possibilities: C (cytosine) or T (thymine). C at position 677 (leading to an alanine at amino acid 222) is the reference allele. The 677T allele (leading to a valine substitution at amino acid 222) encodes a thermolabile alternative enzyme variant with reduced activity. Both reference and alternative genotypes are common, with the alternative allele frequency at 10-35%, depending on ancestry.

Individuals with two copies of 677C (677CC) have the most common genotype. 677TT individuals (homozygous) have lower MTHFR activity than CC or CT (heterozygous) individuals. About ten percent of the North American population are T-homozygous for this polymorphism. There is ethnic variability in the frequency of the T allele – frequency in Mediterranean/Hispanics is greater than the frequency in Caucasians which, in turn, is greater than in Africans/African-Americans.

The degree of enzyme thermolability (assessed as residual activity after heat inactivation) is much greater in 677TT individuals (18–22%) compared with 677CT (56%) and 677CC (66–67%). Individuals of 677TT are predisposed to mild hyperhomocysteinemia (high blood homocysteine levels), because they have less active MTHFR available to produce 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (which is used to decrease homocysteine). Low dietary intake of the vitamin folate can also cause mild hyperhomocysteinemia.

Low folate intake affects individuals with the 677TT genotype to a greater extent than those with the 677CC/CT genotypes. 677TT (but not 677CC/CT) individuals with lower plasma folate levels are at risk for elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In studies of human recombinant MTHFR, the protein encoded by 677T loses its FAD cofactor three times faster than the wild-type protein. 5-Methyl-THF slows the rate of FAD release in both the wild-type and mutant enzymes, although it is to a much greater extent in the mutant enzyme. Low folate status with the consequent loss of FAD enhances the thermolability of the enzyme, thus providing an explanation for the normalised homocysteine and DNA methylation levels in folate-replete 677TT individuals.

This polymorphism and mild hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with neural tube defects in offspring, increased risk for complications of pregnancy other complications of pregnancy, arterial and venous thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. 677TT individuals are at an increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and colon cancer.

Mutations in the &quot;MTHFR&quot; gene could be one of the factors leading to increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients having the risk allele (T\T) show more deficiencies in executive function tasks.

The C677T genotype used to be associated with increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in non Caucasians, however this link has been disproved in recent years. The American College of Medical Genetics recommendation guidelines currently state that people with recurrent pregnancy loss should not be tested for variants in the MTHFR gene.

There is also a tentative link between MTHFR mutations and dementia. One study of an elderly Japanese population found correlations between the MTHFR 677CT mutation, an Apo E polymorphism, and certain types of senile dementia. Other research has found that individuals with folate-related mutations can still have a functional deficiency even when blood levels of folate are within the normal range, and recommended supplementation of methyltetrahydrofolate to potentially prevent and treat dementia (along with depression). A 2011 study from China also found that the C677T SNP was associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Asian populations (though not in Caucasians).

C677T polymorphism is associated with risk of myocardial infarction in African, North American, and elderly populations.

The CDC provides a web page with information on the 

=== A1298C SNP (Glu429Ala) ===

At nucleotide 1298 of the MTHFR, there are two possibilities: A or C. 1298A (leading to a Glu at amino acid 429) is the most common while 1298C (leading to an Ala substitution at amino acid 429) is less common. 1298AA is the &quot;normal&quot; homozygous, 1298AC the heterozygous, and 1298CC the homozygous for the &quot;variant&quot;. In studies of human recombinant MTHFR, the protein encoded by 1298C cannot be distinguished from 1298A in terms of activity, thermolability, FAD release, or the protective effect of 5-methyl-THF. The C mutation does not appear to affect the MTHFR protein. It does not result in thermolabile MTHFR and does not appear to affect homocysteine levels. It does, however, affect the conversion of MTHF to BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin), an important cofactor in the production of neurotransmitters, and the synthesis of nitric oxide.

There has been some commentary on a &#x27;reverse reaction&#x27; in which tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is produced when 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is converted back into methylenetetrahydrofolate. This however is not universally agreed upon. That reaction is thought to require 5-MTHF and SAMe. An alternative opinion is that 5-MTHF processes peroxynitrite, thereby preserving existing BH4, and that no such &#x27;reverse reaction&#x27; occurs.

A maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with Down syndrome pregnancy. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis results showed that this polymorphism is a risk factor for Down syndrome pregnancy in Asian populations but not in Caucasian population as well as in overall meta-analysis.

MTHFR A1298C may play a role as either a driver in the development of major depressive disorder or as a predictive or diagnostic marker, possibly in combination with C677T.

=== Detection of MTHFR polymorphisms ===

A triplex tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method was developed for the simultaneous detection of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with the A66G MTRR polymorphism in a single PCR reaction.

=== Severe MTHFR deficiency ===

Severe MTHFR deficiency is rare (about 50 cases worldwide) and caused by mutations resulting in 0–20% residual enzyme activity. Patients exhibit developmental delay, motor and gait dysfunction, seizures, and neurological impairment and have extremely high levels of homocysteine in their plasma and urine as well as low to normal plasma methionine levels. This deficiency and mutations in &quot;MTHFR&quot; have also been linked to recessive spastic paraparesis with complex I deficiency.

A study on the Chinese Uyghur population indicated that rs1801131 polymorphism in MTHFR was associated with nsCL/P in Chinese Uyghur population. Given the unique genetic and environmental characters of the Uyghur population, these findings may be helpful for exploring the pathogenesis of this complex disease.

==Epigenetics==

The MTHFR aberrant promoter hypermethylation is associated with male infertility. Furthermore, this improper epigenetic phenomenon was observed in semen samples of infertile males belonging to couples with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion. The MTHFR improper promoter hypermethylation may affect the two essential roles of DNA methylation in spermatogenetic cells, the global genome methylation process and the genomic imprinting of paternal genes. In addition, MTHFR gene promoter hypermethylation has also been associated with methylation loss at H19 imprinted gene in semen samples from infertile males.

== As a drug target ==

Inhibitors of MTHFR and antisense knockdown of the expression of the enzyme have been proposed as treatments for cancer. The active form of folate, L-methylfolate, may be appropriate to target for conditions affected by MTHFR polymorphisms.

== Reaction and metabolism ==

The overall reaction catalyzed by MTHFR is illustrated on the right. The reaction uses an NAD(P)H hydride donor and an FAD cofactor. The &quot;E. coli&quot; enzyme has a strong preference for the NADH donor, whereas the mammalian enzyme is specific to NADPH.


==Alternative medicine==
With the growth of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, the alternative medicine industry has aggressively targeted a range of dubious tests and highly profitable quack treatments for claimed MTHFR polymorphisms, despite the lack of any demonstrated health effects of these mutations. The promotion of supplements and other treatments for MTHFR polymorphisms, especially centered on autistic spectrum disorder, have been characterised as snake oil. Tests for MTHFR, while gaining popularity, are generally unnecessary because the association of MTHFR gene mutations with various diseases have not been established as clear-cut cause-and-effect relationship.

<text>Ernest Dominic Capers (born August 7, 1950) is an American football coach who is a senior defensive assistant for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). He was previously the inaugural head coach of the Panthers and the Houston Texans for four seasons each. Capers is the only head coach to lead two different NFL expansion teams during their first seasons.

A defensive assistant for most of his coaching career, Capers held his first defensive coordinator position with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1992. He left Pittsburgh to become the Panthers head coach in 1995, where he guided the team to a 7–9 record, the best finish for an NFL expansion franchise&#x27;s inaugural season. The next year, Capers led the Panthers to a division title and the NFC Championship Game, making them the youngest NFL expansion franchise to accomplish both. Following two consecutive losing records, he was fired after the 1998 season.

Capers&#x27; early success with Carolina would result in him serving as the inaugural head coach of the Texans from 2002 to 2005, although he was unable to lead them to a winning record or playoff berth. He continued to hold assistant coaching positions afterwards, most prominently as the defensive coordinator of the Green Bay Packers from 2009 to 2017, who he helped win Super Bowl XLV.

==Early years==
After playing high school football for the Meadowbrook Colts in Byesville, Ohio, Capers attended Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio where he played linebacker and defensive tackle. He is a brother of the Alpha Nu chapter of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

==Coaching career==
===College===
He began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Kent State University and the University of Washington. Later he was an assistant coach at Hawaii, San Jose State, University of California, Berkeley, Tennessee, and Ohio State.

===Professional===
After a stint in the USFL, he began his NFL career as an assistant with the New Orleans Saints and was named defensive coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1992, including a trip to the AFC Championship game in 1994. He remained with the Steelers until becoming head coach of the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1995. After 1995&#x27;s 7–9 season, a record breaking mark for an expansion team, the Panthers posted a 12–4 record in 1996 and advanced to the NFC Championship game, where they were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl XXXI champion Green Bay Packers. This would end up being Capers&#x27; only winning season as a head coach, as well as the only season in which his team qualified for the playoffs. Continuing to spend against the salary cap, and eventually taking control of personnel matters in 1997, the Panthers went 7–9, followed by a 4–12 season in 1998, at the end of which he was terminated.

After being let go from the Panthers, he served as the defensive coordinator with the Jacksonville Jaguars until becoming the head coach of the expansion Houston Texans on January 21, 2001. After starting out 4–12 (2002) and 5–11 (2003) in his first two seasons in Houston, the Texans posted a 7–9 mark in 2004. However, the Texans dropped to a record of 2–14 in 2005 and Capers was fired.

On January 23, 2006, the Miami Dolphins announced the hiring of Dom Capers as the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator. There, he served as assistant head coach. With an annual salary of $2.6 million, Capers was the highest paid assistant coach in the NFL, alongside Washington Redskins assistant head coach Gregg Williams. On Thursday, January 3, 2008, Dom Capers was fired along with all offensive and defensive coaches.

On January 29, 2008, Capers interviewed with the Dallas Cowboys for the vacant linebackers coach position. It is rumored that he was offered the defensive coordinator or defensive consultant position.

On February 21, 2008, Capers was hired by the Patriots as their secondary coach/special assistant, replacing Joel Collier.

On January 19, 2009, Capers was named the Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator by head coach Mike McCarthy and general manager Ted Thompson, where he replaced the 4–3 defense Green Bay had used since 1992 with the 3–4 he used in Miami. Green Bay&#x27;s defensive ranking in his first year improved to second in the league in 2009, from 21st in the league in 2008.

Between September 12, 2010, and January 2011, Capers&#x27; defense finished the regular season ranked 2nd in scoring defense, 5th in total defense, 2nd in interceptions, 2nd in sacks, and 1st in opposing quarterback passer rating, in spite of being decimated by injuries during the 2010 season. On February 6, 2011, Capers led a 5th ranked defensive squad and helped the Packers win the Super Bowl. During the playoff run his team had a pick six in the final 3 playoff games that year; Divisional Round (Williams), Championship game (Raji), and in Super Bowl XLV (Collins).

On January 1, 2018, he was fired as the defensive coordinator of the Green Bay Packers by head coach Mike McCarthy.

On February 19, 2019, the Jacksonville Jaguars announced that Capers will join their coaching staff as a senior defensive assistant. After one season in Jacksonville, he joined the Minnesota Vikings on February 10, 2020, in the same capacity. His contract with the Vikings was not renewed after the season.

On January 29, 2021, the Detroit Lions announced that Capers will join their coaching staff as a senior defensive assistant.

On February 11, 2022, Capers was hired by the Denver Broncos to serve as a senior defensive assistant for the 2022 season. Following a year-long stint with the Broncos, Capers returned to the Carolina Panthers to serve as a senior defensive assistant under newly hired head coach Frank Reich.

<doc id="1334942" wikidata="Q4883610" url="?curid=1334942" title="Belle Brezing">
<text>Belle Brezing (June 16, 1860 – August 11, 1940) was a nationally known madam in Lexington, Kentucky at the end of the 19th century and into the beginning of the 20th. Her brothel was known as the &quot;most orderly of disorderly houses&quot;.

==Early life==
Belle Brezing was born Mary Belle Cox, the illegitimate daughter of Sarah Ann Cox. Sarah Cox was a dressmaker who also worked part-time as a prostitute. Sarah Cox subsequently married George Brezing, a saloon operative, grocer and alcoholic, in 1861, whose name Belle adopted.

At the age of 12, the age of consent at the time, Brezing was seduced by Dionesio Mucci, a local merchant who was three times her age. In 1874, when Brezing was age, Mucci gave her a scrapbook, in which she started keeping magazine clippings, Valentine cards, and photographs—as well as a poem she composed, titled &quot;Kisses&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sitting to night in my chamber, 
a school girl figure and lonely,
I kiss the end of my finger. 
that and that only.
Reveries rises from the smokey mouth 
Memories linger surround me. 
Boys that are married or single.
Gather around me. School boys in pantalets romping, 
Boys that now are growing to be young lads,
Boys that like to be kissed, and like to give kisses.
Kisses—well I remember them; 
Those in the corner were fleetest;
Sweet were those on the sly in the Dark were the sweetest
Girls are tender and gentle, 
To woo was almost to win them.
They lips are good as ripe peaches, and cream for finger.
Girls are sometimes flirts, and coquettish;
Now catch and kiss if you can sin; 
Could I catch both—ah, wasn&#x27;t I a happy Girl,
Boys is pretty and blooming sweetly, yea 
Sweetness over their rest
Them I loved dearly and truly, Last and the best.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The relationship with Mucci lasted two years, but Brezing had other lovers during this time, including cigar makers James Kenney and Johnny Cook.

Soon after her 15th birthday in 1875, Brezing became pregnant—possibly by Johnny Cook, but she had at least three lovers at this time. On September 14, 1875, when Brezing was three months pregnant, she married James Kenney, but never lived with him. After the wedding ceremony, she returned to her mother&#x27;s house. Nine days later, Brezing wrote to Cook asking for a gun. Cook was found outside Brezing&#x27;s house with a bullet in his skull. Mucci was allegedly the last person to see Cook alive. Kenney immediately left Lexington and didn&#x27;t return for 10 years. The death was recorded as a suicide, but popular opinion was that Cook was murdered.

On March 14, 1876, Brezing gave birth to a daughter, Daisy May Kenney. In May of that year, Brezing&#x27;s mother died of cancer. While at the funeral, her mother&#x27;s landlord padlocked the house, leaving Brezing and her baby homeless. Brezing left her baby with a neighbor, with a promise to always provide for her, and she turned to prostitution.

Belle&#x27;s first job in a brothel began December 24, 1879 in a house maintained by Jenny Hill, which has the distinction of being the former residence of First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Brezing quickly became the brothel&#x27;s top earner and had bankers and politicians among her clients.

==Belle&#x27;s &quot;bawdy houses&quot;==

In July 1881, Brezing rented a house at 156 North Upper Street and opened her own brothel. Around this time, she arranged for her daughter Daisy May to be sent to an institution in Newport, Kentucky. Daisy May was mentally disabled and spent the rest of her life in institutions in Newport and Detroit. Brezing again became pregnant, but the baby was stillborn in July 1882.

Brezing was determined to make her brothel the finest in Lexington, with the best surroundings and entertainment. She made frequent trips to Cincinnati and New York City to buy linens, furnishings, and clothes for the brothel. She had many influential citizens among her clients, including bankers, businessmen and politicians. When arrested for keeping a &quot;bawdy house&quot; in December 1882, she received a pardon from Kentucky Governor Luke P. Blackburn.

Two years after starting her brothel, she saved enough money to buy a house, 194 North Upper Street. The brothel transferred to the new premises in July 1883. In the same year, she became attached to bookkeeper William &quot;Billy&quot; Mabon. The couple stayed together until his death.

On January 13, 1889, the &quot;Lexington Daily Press&quot; published a &quot;Petition of Citizens&quot; on the front page, which called for the closing of &quot;houses of ill fame conducted by Belle Breezing at 194 North Upper Street; Lettie Powell, 196 N Upper Street; and Molly Parker, 154 N Upper Street.&quot;

With the help of Philadelphia millionaire William M Singerly, Brezing brought new premises at 153 Megowan Street (now 153 N. Eastern Ave) in the city&#x27;s red-light district. The brothel quickly became established as one of the more stylish in the city. The house was badly damaged in a fire in 1895, but rebuilding started immediately. During the building works, an additional floor was added.

Brezing was known for her charity. When the local hospital had a fire, she bought all the bed linen locally and sent it to the hospital. A local prostitute, Debbie Harvey, was murdered in 1911. Brezing ensured she had a proper burial in Lexington Cemetery.

The Temperance Movement was gaining strength, and in 1915, it pressured the city commissioners into issuing an ordnance requiring brothels to close. Brezing and some other madams ignored the ordinance. When the US entered World War I in 1917, soldiers were stationed nearby, and the U.S. Army ordered to city to close the brothels. On February 16, 1917, Billy Mabon died, and by November of that year, Brezing closed the brothel.

==Retirement and death==
Brezing continued to live in the premises until her death in 1940. Addicted to morphine, Brezing was attended to by her doctor Dr. C.A. Nevitt. She was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 1938, and she died on August 11, 1940. She was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Lexington. Her tombstone reads &quot;Blessed Be the Pure in Heart&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published her obituary, calling her a &quot;famed Kentucky bawd.&quot; The &quot;Lexington Herald&quot; published a front-page eulogy. Her estate was auctioned over several days. The house was converted into apartments, and in 1973 a fire consumed the upper floor. The remaining architectural details were auctioned. Bricks salvaged from the home were sold to the public with the inscription: &quot;Brick from the Belle Brezing Home - The most orderly of Dis-orderly Homes&quot;.

==&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;==
Brezing is believed to have been the model for Belle Watling in &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; Margaret Mitchell allegedly heard about Brezing from her husband who previously lived in Lexington. Mitchell denied basing Watling on Brezing. The film adaptation was released six months before Brezing&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
Still standing, one of her other former houses is on the campus of Transylvania University and houses a women&#x27;s locker room.

Brezing is commemorated annually in Lexington by a bed race in April. Several of the city&#x27;s streets are closed to make a course for the race.

Margaret C. Price wrote a play about Brezing, titled &quot;Belle Brezing&quot;. It was performed at the Lost Theatre in Los Angeles during the summer of 2008. In 2011, Lexington&#x27;s Actors Guild Theatre presented the play. Laurie Genet Preston, the actress who played Brezing, previously played this role in a 2004 presentation of the play at the University of Kentucky.

Director and producer Doug High made a documentary about Brezing&#x27;s life: &quot;Belle Brezing &amp; the Gilded Age of the Bluegrass&quot;. The documentary was narrated by Elizabeth Shatner (wife of William Shatner), and Brezing again was played by Laurie Genet Preston. The film premiered at the Kentucky Theatre Lexington on February 16, 2017.

<doc id="1334948" wikidata="Q5786759" url="?curid=1334948" title="Lupus anticoagulant">
<text>Lupus anticoagulant is an immunoglobulin that binds to phospholipids and proteins associated with the cell membrane. Its name is a partial misnomer, as it is actually a prothrombotic antibody &quot;in vivo&quot;. The name derives from their properties &quot;in vitro&quot;, as these antibodies increase coagulation times in laboratory tests such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Investigators speculate that the antibodies interfere with phospholipids used to induce in vitro coagulation. In vivo, the antibodies are thought to interact with platelet membrane phospholipids, increasing adhesion and aggregation of platelets, which accounts for the in vivo prothrombotic characteristics.

The condition was first described by hematologist C. Lockard Conley in 1952.

==Terminology==
Both words in the term &quot;lupus anticoagulant&quot; can be misleading:
* Most patients with a lupus anticoagulant do not actually have lupus erythematosus, and only a small proportion will proceed to develop this disease (which causes joint pains, skin problems and kidney failure, amongst other complications). People with lupus erythematosus are more likely to develop a lupus anticoagulant than the general population.
* The term &quot;anticoagulant&quot; accurately describes its function in vitro. However in vivo, it functions as a &quot;procoagulant&quot;. The &quot;lupus anticoagulant paradox&quot; may be explained by platelet activation as described above, as well as enhancement of activated protein C resistance and suppression of the anticoagulant activity of TFPIα. Another proposed mechanism is the antibody-mediated destruction of Annexin A5 on the membranes of endothelial cells and trophoblast cells.

==Indications for testing==
The main indication for testing for lupus anticoagulant is a suspected antiphospholipid syndrome, whose main manifestations are blood clots (thrombosis) in both arteries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia.

In a suspected antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus anticoagulant is generally tested in conjunction with anti-apolipoprotein antibodies and anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and diagnostic criteria require one clinical event (i.e. thrombosis or pregnancy complication) and two positive blood test results spaced at least three months apart that detect at least one of the three types of antibodies.

Testing for lupus anticoagulant can also be indicated by a prolonged aPTT test that is unexplained.

== Workup ==
An aPTT is generally included in a differential diagnosis in vague symptoms, and is a non-specific test of coagulation. In contrast, the prothrombin time (PT), another non-specific coagulation test, is normally unaffected by lupus anticoagulant. Nevertheless, falsely increased PT has been reported, likely by lupus anticoagulant interfering with the phospholipid component of the PT reagent, particularly when using recombinant tissue factor and purified phospholipids.
A mixing test is generally in the initial workup of a prolonged aPTT. In a mixing test, patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and the clotting is reassessed. If a clotting inhibitor such as a lupus anticoagulant is present, the inhibitor will interact with the normal pooled plasma and the clotting time will generally remain abnormal. However, if the clotting time of the mixed plasma corrects towards normal, the presence of an inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant is less likely, instead indicating a deficient quantity of clotting factor (that is replenished by the normal plasma). In case of a corrected mixing test, a lower dose of normal pooled plasma is often used, such as a 4:1 mix (4 times as much patient plasma than normal pooled plasma), as some studies suggest that this method is more sensitive for the detection of a weak lupus anticoagulant that is not enough prevalent or potent to affect a 1:1 mix.

However, only about 60 per cent of patients with lupus anticoagulants have a both a prolonged APTT and APTT mix, making it unsuitable as the only test in case of a high suspicion of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Thus, one or more of the following tests are generally performed to detect lupus anticoagulant if a high suspicion remains, and/or specify lupus anticoagulant as the cause of an abnormal mixing test:
* Phospholipid-sensitive functional clotting testing, such as the dilute Russell&#x27;s viper venom time, Kaolin clotting time, or silica clotting time. As a further confirmation, a second test with the addition of excess phospholipid will correct the prolongation (conceptually known as &quot;phospholipid neutralization&quot;), confirming the diagnosis of a lupus anticoagulant.
* Lupus-sensitive aPTT, of which many variants exist, but have the common feature of having a greater sensitivity of becoming prolonged in the presence of lupus anticoagulant compared to a regular aPTT.
* Hexagonal (II) phase phospholipid neutralization, wherein such phospholipids specifically neutralize lupus anticoagulant, so a normalization of aPTT after adding it specifically indicates the presence lupus anticoagulants.

Guidelines for lupus anticoagulant testing have been issued by the ISTH, CLSI, and the British Committee for Standards in Haematology. The result may be reported as a ratio used to identify the cutoff. A ratio of 1.2 is commonly used, such that a value &lt;1.2 indicates the absence of a lupus anticoagulant, while a value &gt;1.2 indicates the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. Direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists used to treat thrombosis can interfere with lupus anticoagulant assays and generate either false-positive or false-negative findings.

==Treatment==
Treatment for a lupus anticoagulant is usually undertaken in the context of documented thrombosis, such as extremity phlebitis or dural sinus vein thrombosis. Patients with a well-documented (i.e., present at least twice) lupus anticoagulant and a history of thrombosis should be considered candidates for indefinite treatment with anticoagulants. Patients with no history of thrombosis and a lupus anticoagulant should probably be observed. Current evidence suggests that the risk of recurrent thrombosis in patients with an antiphospholipid antibody is enhanced whether that antibody is measured on serological testing or functional testing. The Sapporo criteria specify that both serological and functional tests must be positive to diagnose the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

Miscarriages may be more prevalent in patients with a lupus anticoagulant. Some of these miscarriages may &quot;potentially&quot; be prevented with the administration of aspirin and unfractionated heparin. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews provide a deeper understanding on the subject. For refractory cases, hydroxychloroquine may be considered.

Thrombosis is treated with anticoagulants (LMWHs and warfarin).

<text>Stamford Brook was a tributary of the Tideway stretch of the River Thames in west London supplied by three headwaters. Historically used as an irrigation ditch or , the network of small watercourses had four lower courses and mouths.

==History==

===Etymology===

The name Stamford Brook may be a corruption of &quot;stony ford&quot;, for a crossing by King Street. It has given its name to the surrounding area between Hammersmith and Chiswick, and to the local London Underground station, Stamford Brook.

The county of London created in 1889 was bounded by the westernmost course of Stamford Brook; it formed the boundary separating London Boroughs of Hammersmith and Acton in the new county from the Chiswick and Brentford Urban Districts in Middlesex.

By 1900, all six strands of the brook and drainage dykes had been covered over and formed the most useful depressions available to site the neighbourhood&#x27;s sewers, and many diversionary surface water drains had been created closer to the surface to drain the catchment basin.

==Disambiguation==

Stamford Brook has no known connection with Stamford Bridge, the site of a bridge which carries the Kings Road over the stream to the east called Counter&#x27;s Creek which rose to the immediate west of Notting Hill. The West London bridge gives its name to Chelsea Football Club&#x27;s adjoining ground.

==Course==

===Headwaters===

A western headwater, the Bollo Brook or Bollar Brook was the westernmost brook feeding the channels running through Chiswick and Hammersmith. This rose on the site of Ealing Common Underground station, midway between Ealing and Acton and travelled south, then southeast, then divided, part was channelled south to Chiswick House and Chiswick; the remainder was channelled into four mouths described below. The main flow travelled east to the north of King Street, Hammersmith.

Surface water and foul water drains beside and under short stretches of Piccadilly and District lines followed by the rear of numbers up to 438 Chiswick High Road, then turn ENE follow the lowest depression of that watercourse, cutting across Chiswick Common, crossing the District Line at Turnham Green tube station to reach the formerly seasonally waterlogged, low-lying area of &quot;Stamford Brook Common&quot;.

Fresh water features such as the fishponds by the London Transport Museum Depot on the current location of Acton Town Underground station have been lost due to use of the depression for separate drainage systems.

An eastern headwater rose on Old Oak Common in Acton. north east of the Old Acton Wells, also known as Acton Wells
 and flowed south down Old Oak Common Road and Old Oak Road then SSE down Askew Road. This course, now overtaken by segregation of surface water drainage and sanitary sewers afterwards ran the line of Paddenswick Road where it was joined by a flow emerging from Ravenscourt Park.

A middle headwater formed in North Acton near the interchange of the A40 and was known locally as the &quot;Warple&quot; — this ran southwards just west of Horn Lane, under the park &quot;Springfield Gardens&quot; turned east underneath the small park, &quot;The Woodlands&quot; by Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College in Acton, ran south of Acton High Street/the Vale behind the long-established swimming location fed from the mineral wells above, Acton Swimming Baths, then ran south down Warple Way where toward the end of this road is a large sewage storage and pumping station. After this the brook split at &quot;The Brook&quot; public house on Stamford Brook Common. One branch from this point headed east past Ravenscourt Park and fed the former moat there.

==Mouths==
From Paddenswick Road by Ravenscourt Park the original and middle mouth took a due south route along Dalling Road, under King Street and through Hammersmith Registry Office, Cromwell Avenue to the River Thames. This mouth, once providing high tide mooring was known as Hammersmith Creek.

The eastern mouth, Parr&#x27;s Ditch was a more complicated, field-watering affair, an alternative brook as the main area inconveniently for agriculture overflowed at times and for irrigation of Hammersmith, that continued due east through Hammersmith into a natural trough, now the long park known as Brook Green. To reach this long green, a line parallel to Attwood and Kilmarsh Roads was taken, after Brook Green the route turned south and then southwest and took Collet Gardens, Wilson and Yeldham Roads to reach the Thames.

A ditch of the western channel was funnelled to the southern depression of parkland in Chiswick to augment the waters in the grounds of Chiswick House. Its main supply the &quot;Hazeldene&quot; ran from a lake near Sydney House to the west. The waters feed the lakes and fountains at Chiswick House, and then drain into the River Thames downstream of Barnes Bridge An additional western channel was added from Stamford Green, running underneath Stamford Brook Avenue and British Grove. Accordingly, elevations of Stamford Brook Avenue range from whereas east in Ravensbourne Park, the destination of the stream depicted in early maps, the elevations are AOB by Paddeswick Road.

Close to the River Thames, the lower reaches of the above routes used for sanitary sewers are intercepted by Sir Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s Northern Low Level Sewer which reaches the Northern Outfall Sewer in Stratford, however directly south of the original mouth are overflow outfalls in Furnival Gardens and of the western mouth on Chiswick Eyot which regularly are in use during rainy days, leading to a major project underway, the Thames Tideway Scheme, a strong motivation for which is the desire to comply with the EU&#x27;s Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.

Audacious plans in 2008 were proposed by a firm of architects whose chief vision was to recreate a marshy stream at the Walbrook, as in pre-Roman London, to recreate Hammersmith Creek in Hammersmith by putting the A4 underground. City planners consider however that while extra water provides a few expensive views for residents, it does not provide recreational or air quality improving space.

<text>Dennis Earl Green (February 17, 1949 – July 22, 2016) was an American football coach. During his National Football League (NFL) career, Green coached the Minnesota Vikings from 1992 to 2001 and the Arizona Cardinals from 2004 to 2006. He coached the Vikings to eight playoff appearances in nine years, despite having seven different starting quarterbacks in those postseasons. He was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Vikings Ring of Honor in 2018.

Green was the second African American head coach in modern NFL history, after Art Shell. He was the Minnesota Vikings head coach from 1992 to 2001. He was one of the winningest coaches of the 1990s, posting a 97–62 record as Vikings head coach. Green&#x27;s best season in Minnesota was in 1998, when the Vikings finished 15–1 and set the NFL record for most points in a season at the time; however, the Vikings were upset by the Atlanta Falcons in that year&#x27;s NFC Championship Game, and Green was unable to reach the Super Bowl throughout his otherwise successful tenure with Minnesota. Following his first losing record in 2001, he was fired just before the final game of the season.

Green was hired by the Cardinals to serve as the head coach for the 2004 season, a franchise then noted for its futility, which had posted only one winning season in a quarter-century. In Arizona, Green was unable to match his success in Minnesota, and his poor win–loss record (16–32) with the Cardinals was similar to that of his predecessors in Arizona. However, many describe Green&#x27;s tenure with Arizona as an inflection point in the history of the Cardinals, arguing that the culture of the team changed under Green, and that the core of the personnel in the Cardinals&#x27; 2008 Super Bowl run was acquired by Green.

==Early and personal life==
Green grew up in a working class household in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at the corner of Walnut and N 12th street. In 2019, the 1100 to 1300 block of Walnut Street was renamed &quot;Dennis Green Way&quot; to honor the late native. His father, Penrose &quot;Bus&quot; Green, was the grandson of a Cuban slave who immigrated to Baltimore, Maryland and married a Seneca Indian. Green&#x27;s father served in World War II before briefly playing for the Harrisburg Lions semi-pro football team. His mother, Anna Green, was a beautician born in Greensboro, North Carolina and raised in Harrisburg. Green describes a traumatic start to his teenage years in his book &quot;No Room for Crybabies&quot;. His father died at 39 from a ruptured appendix when Green was only 11 years old. Two years later his mother died from breast cancer that went undetected by doctors. Green, the youngest of five boys was thereafter raised by his older brothers: Penrose Green II, Robert Green, Stanley Green, and Gregory Green. 

Green attended John Harris High School (now Harrisburg High School) in Harrisburg, and graduated cum laude from the University of Iowa with a BS in Recreational Studies. According to Green, he was planning to be a high school teacher if his football career did not pan out. In college, he started as halfback in each of his three seasons with the Iowa Hawkeyes, playing under coach Ray Nagel. 
In his collegiate career, Green had 139 carries for 699 yards and nine touchdowns. His best individual game was in a 1968 loss to Texas Christian University, when he rushed 18 times for 175 yards and two touchdowns.

Green has four children from two marriages: Patti Green (born April, 1967), Jeremy Green (born July, 1971), Vanessa Green (born February, 1997), and Zachary Dennis Green (born November, 1998).

==Boycott of 1969==
Green received a full ride athletic scholarship to attend the University of Iowa in the fall of 1967. During this time, many black athletes spoke out about racial issues in Iowa City that affected their social life outside of athletics, and, most importantly, in the classroom. In 1968, eighteen black student-athletes from the university&#x27;s football and basketball teams were interviewed for an article in a local newspaper, &quot;The Daily Iowan&quot;. Green, pictured on the second page of the article, stated, &quot;The middle class whites believe in this black stereotype, and they believe all blacks fit into that black stereotype.&quot; Football player Louis Age, who was born and raised in New Orleans, said, &quot;It is better in the south than it is here. You look at the white man down there and you know he doesn&#x27;t like you; up here you don&#x27;t know what to think. This place definitely has a phony atmosphere.&quot; After the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling that racial segregation in education was unconstitutional, many of these issues arose for black students as they began to attend universities around the country.

In 1969, led by running back Green, sixteen black players of Iowa&#x27;s Football team boycotted spring practice. The players were protesting a decision by coach Ray Nagel to suspended two black players — both starters from the previous season — for undisclosed reasons. The sixteen players were subsequently dismissed from the team. That did not stop them from continuing to advocate for changes within the athletic department to better support black athletes. Green was quoted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as saying in 1992, &quot;the school wasn&#x27;t ready for us, but it was also the times. Black guys wanted to prove their manhood, their boldness, to stand up and be counted.&quot;

Coleman Lane, one of the dismissed athletes, said, &quot;The main crux of our demands is academic, and white and black will both benefit from it, only the black will benefit more.&quot; The demands listed by the football players and the Black Athletes Union were an attempt to improve the plight of black student athletes not only at the University of Iowa, but also at universities throughout the United States.

Aftermath

Because of their stance, most of the items the black players demanded were implemented at Iowa, and throughout the Big Ten, within a few years, and a couple of them within a few months.

As the &#x27;69 season grew near, the players, including Green, asked to be reinstated. Nagel had the majority white squad vote on the players individually at a team meeting. Seven were reinstated, including Green, but five were rejected. 

The boycott cost some of the players their football careers. While some of the black players were allowed back on the team, a handful saw their college careers end prematurely because of their participation in the boycott against the university&#x27;s unjust academic and athletic prejudices.

Because of Green&#x27;s participation in the boycott, NFL teams with Green on their draft radar decided to pass on him in the 1971 NFL draft, thus cutting his athletic career short. Specifically, the Dallas Cowboys had planned to draft Green, but instead picked running back Sam Scarber, who was subsequently waived before the season started. He went on to be a successful actor, appearing in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; in 1984.

After graduating from Iowa, Green briefly played professionally for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1971 before beginning his successful coaching career. At the time of his death in 2016, he was the third most successful black head coach in NFL history, behind his protégé Tony Dungy and Mike Tomlin.

==Assistant coaching career==
Green began his football coaching career, returning to the University of Iowa in 1972 as a graduate assistant. He then served as an assistant coach at the University of Dayton (1973), University of Iowa (1974 to 1976) and Stanford University, where he coached under Bill Walsh in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, Green joined Walsh&#x27;s staff on the San Francisco 49ers, where he coached special teams. Green returned to Stanford in 1980 as offensive coordinator, coaching with Jim Fassel and Jack Harbaugh.

== College coaching career ==
In 1981, Green was named the head coach of Northwestern University, a school that had gone 1–31–1 in its last 33 games. In 1981, he was only the second African American head coach in Division I-A history (the previous coach, Willie Jeffries, coached at Wichita State, which no longer has a football team). Green was named the Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year, as chosen by writers and broadcasters, in 1982 at Northwestern. He left Northwestern in 1985, doing a stint as the wide receivers coach for the San Francisco 49ers under his former boss at Stanford, Bill Walsh. In his last season with the San Francisco 49ers, they reached the 1989 NFL Super Bowl Championship Game, in which Green made the play call that led to John Taylor&#x27;s 10-yard TD reception from Joe Montana that secured the win with 39 seconds left.

In 1989, Green took the head coaching position at Stanford University, inheriting a team that had graduated 17 of its 21 starters from 1988. Green led the Cardinals from 1989 to 1991. During that time, his teams finished with an overall record of 16–18, a .471 winning percentage, going 3–0 in the Big Game against the California Golden Bears. In 1990, his Stanford team defeated top-ranked Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. His tenure culminated with an 8–3 record (Stanford&#x27;s best since 1986). A loss to Washington in the opening game of the season was the deciding factor for the Pac-10 championship. The Cardinals made an appearance in the 1991 Aloha Bowl, where his team lost to Georgia Tech on a last-minute touchdown.

==Professional coaching career==

===Minnesota Vikings===
Green was a disciple of Bill Walsh&#x27;s West Coast offense, and was touted by Walsh and other NFL pundits as a likely candidate to be the second African-American head coach in the NFL. On January 10, 1992, Green was named 5th head coach of the Minnesota Vikings, replacing the retiring Jerry Burns. The day he was introduced as the Vikings&#x27; head coach, he announced that there was a &quot;new sheriff in town&quot;. He was the second African American head coach, after Art Shell, in the modern NFL era, and the first to do so without ever playing in the NFL. Green was the third in NFL history, after Fritz Pollard in the 1920s, and Shell.

Through his first six years with the team, Green never posted a losing record, and the team failed to qualify for the playoffs only once. He was reportedly the pioneer of using the team&#x27;s day off on Tuesday to do charity work in the community, which eventually became common in the NFL. Initially, Green earned widespread praise for turning around what had recently been a lackluster franchise. However, as the team&#x27;s fan-base grew accustomed to regular season success, he came under criticism for failing to advance the team deeper into the playoffs.

In 1996, two members of the Vikings&#x27; ownership board, Wheelock Whitney and Jane Dyer, reportedly contacted Lou Holtz, who was the coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team and former coach of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team. They wanted to bring Holtz in to replace Green. Holtz abruptly announced his retirement in 1996, and rumors surrounded the reasons, one of which was the possible Vikings head coaching position.

In 1997, Green published his autobiography &quot;No Room For Crybabies&quot;, in which he responded to the criticism and perceived personal vendettas by Twin Cities sports writers Bob Sansevere, Dan Barreiro, and Patrick Reusse. He threatened to sue the team as his response to the Lou Holtz rumors.

The high point of Green&#x27;s Vikings career was the 1998 season, when the team went 15–1 and set the NFL record for the most points scored in a season. (The 2013 Denver Broncos under John Fox currently hold this record.) The Vikings advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing to the Atlanta Falcons after Atlanta&#x27;s Morten Andersen made a field goal in overtime.

In 2001, the Vikings finished with a losing record for the first time in Green&#x27;s decade with the team and there were reported disagreements between Green and team owner Red McCombs; Green was reported to have almost resigned midseason because of McCombs insisting that he fire assistant coach and director of pro personnel Richard Solomon. The Vikings bought out Green&#x27;s contract on January 4, 2002. Assistant coach Mike Tice led the team in their final regular season game against the Baltimore Ravens, and was eventually hired as the head coach.

===Arizona Cardinals===
After spending two seasons as an analyst for ESPN, Green was hired as head coach by the Arizona Cardinals on January 7, 2004. Through his first two years with the team, he totaled 11 wins with the Cardinals and finished third in the NFC West, an improvement over predecessor Dave McGinnis. Unlike his previous two seasons, the 2006 season began with great expectations for the Cardinals, with the opening of a new stadium, sellout crowds, the drafting of quarterback Matt Leinart, and the signing of Pro Bowl running back Edgerrin James. After a solid start, the Cardinals suffered some tough early losses.

==== &quot;They are who we thought they were!&quot; ====
The worst of these came in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on October 16, 2006, losing a 20-point lead to the Chicago Bears in less than twenty minutes, without the Bears scoring any points on offense. Asked about how Chicago&#x27;s tenacious defense forced six turnovers and shut down the Arizona offense, the normally soft-spoken Green unloaded from the lectern:

The day after the press conference, offensive coordinator Keith Rowen was fired and replaced with quarterbacks coach Mike Kruczek. Although Green later apologized for the outburst, and the Cardinals rallied to win four of their last seven games, including a rare win over playoff-bound Seattle, many pundits felt that the loss to Chicago and ensuing tirade had already sealed Green&#x27;s fate. On January 1, 2007, the Cardinals fired Green with a year left on his contract.

Green&#x27;s tirade is still used heavily in NFL media coverage today, often comically, to describe the obvious flaws of an opponent and the failure to capitalize on that knowledge. It was featured in a Coors TV advertisement.

===Later career===
In August 2007, the Westwood One radio network announced that it had hired Green to serve as a color analyst on their Thursday night NFL broadcasts.

On March 11, 2009, it was announced that Green would be the head coach of the San Francisco franchise for the United Football League&#x27;s inaugural season. Green&#x27;s first game as California Redwoods coach was a 30–17 loss to the Las Vegas Locomotives.

Beginning with the 2010 season, the Redwoods moved to Sacramento and were renamed the Mountain Lions. Green remained as head coach for the 2011 seasons as well, his final season with the Mountain Lions. After leaving the team, Green sued the league for lack of payment on a $1.5 million contract for the 2011 season. (The United Football League suspended play in October 2012 amid lawsuits alleging unpaid debts.) An arbitrator awarded Green $990,000 for the 2011 season, and the award was upheld in February 2014 by a San Francisco Superior Court judge.

==Death==

On Thursday July 22, 2016, Green died at the age of 67 due to complications from cardiac arrest. He was survived by his wife Marie and his four children.

After his death, the Vikings team released a statement saying, &quot;He mentored countless players and served as a father figure for the men he coached. He took great pride in helping assistant coaches advance their careers. His tenure as one of the first African American head coaches in both college and the NFL was also transformative. Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Green family.&quot;

<doc id="1334973" wikidata="Q5176868" url="?curid=1334973" title="Counter's Creek">
<text>Counter&#x27;s Creek, ending in Chelsea Creek, the lowest part of which still exists, was a stream that flowed from Kensal Green, by North Kensington and flowed south into the River Thames on the Tideway at Sands End, Fulham. Its remaining open watercourse is the quay of Chelsea Creek.

==Course==

Counter&#x27;s Creek flowed from Kensal Green, by North Kensington at the confluence of two small headwaters that rose just west of Ladbroke Grove and entered the stream close to Latimer Road just south of St Quintin Avenue. The stream flowed south through Kensal Green Cemetery, Little Wormwood Scrubs, North Kensington, past Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to one side and the Olympia part of Kensington on the other and then past Earl&#x27;s Court and Old or West Brompton on the other. As a vestige, an overflow verdant ditch exists beside Platform 4 (trains to Olympia) of West Brompton Underground Station. It passes Brompton Cemetery and Chelsea F.C. ground at Stamford Bridge. On the left bank where the creek meets the Thames is the former Lots Road Power Station. The tidal mouth is a watercourse, connecting to the Thames with boat moorings and is shown on modern maps as Chelsea Creek; this part of Fulham is sometimes known by the toponym &quot;Sands End&quot;.

==History==
The upper reaches have been variously known as Billingswell Ditch, Pools Creek and Counters Creek. In the Middle Ages, the creek was known as Billingwell Dyche, derived from &#x27;Billing&#x27;s spring or stream&#x27;. It formed the boundary between the parishes of Kensington and Fulham. By the eighteenth century, the creek had become known as Counter&#x27;s Creek, which is believed to derive from &#x27;Counter&#x27;s Bridge&#x27; which crossed the creek at the west end of Kensington High Street. This was first recorded in the fourteenth century as &#x27;Countessesbrugge&#x27;, and may be called after Matilda/Maud, Countess of Oxford, who in early centuries after the Conquest held the manor of Kensington. Stamford Bridge is considered to be a corruption of &#x27;Samfordesbrigge&#x27; meaning &#x27;the bridge at the sandy ford&#x27; where the Fulham Road crosses the brook. The existing Stamford Bridge was built of brick in 1860–2 and has been partly reconstructed since then. The name is more generally used to refer to the nearby Stamford Bridge Stadium, which is the home of Chelsea Football Club. In 1824–8 the lowest part of the creek was developed into the Kensington Canal. This was taken over by the Bristol Birmingham &amp; Thames Junction Railway in the 1830s and subsequently much was culverted to take the West London Line along its course in 1859–63. This railway route links Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction via Kensington Olympia. Only the lower reach remained in use, supplying coal to Sands End gas works and later to Lots Road Power Station. The stream was visible as a surface river on the west side of Little Wormwood Scrubs on Ordnance Survey maps pre-1930 by which time surface water drains had been introduced, some of which fed the sewer, others which conveyed surface water separately.

Its depression has been conveniently used since the 19th century and rise of the water closet for the sanitation of the area by building a combined sewer underneath it and to prevent flooding, to construct where the Metropolitan Board of Works and London Boroughs have found affordable, separate surface water drains leading to the Thames.

<text>Ethel Turner (24 January 1872 – 8 April 1958) was an English-born Australian novelist and children&#x27;s literature writer.

==Life==

She was born Ethel Mary Burwell in Doncaster in England. Her father died when she was two, leaving her mother Sarah Jane Burwell with two daughters (Ethel and Lillian). A year later, Sarah Jane married Henry Turner, who was 20 years older and had six children of his own. Sarah Jane and Henry had a daughter, Rose. Henry Turner died suddenly, leaving Sarah Jane with nine children and little income. In 1879 Sarah Jane moved to Australia with Ethel, Lillian, and Rose; within the next two years she married Charles Cope and gave birth to his son Rex.

Turner was educated at Paddington, New South Wales Public School and Sydney Girls High School—she was one of the school&#x27;s original thirty-seven pupils.

She started her writing career at eighteen, founding the &quot;Parthenon,&quot; a journal for young people, with her sister Lillian. As &#x27;Dame Durden&#x27; she wrote children&#x27;s columns for the &quot;Illustrated Sydney News&quot; and later for the &quot;Australian Town and Country Journal&quot;. In 1891, the family moved to &quot;Inglewood&quot; (now known as &quot;Woodlands&quot;), a large house in Lindfield, now Killara, which was then out in the country. &quot;Woodlands&quot; still stands today in Werona Avenue and is where she wrote &quot;Seven Little Australians&quot;.

In 1896 Ethel married Herbert Curlewis, a lawyer. After living in Mosman, they built their own house overlooking Middle Harbour. The house, Avenel, is where Turner spent the rest of her years. She survived her daughter Jean Curlewis, who died of tuberculosis, by 28 years. Jean was also a writer of children&#x27;s books, although not as popular as her mother. Jean&#x27;s works include &quot;The Ship That Never Set Sail&quot;, &quot;Drowning Maze&quot;, and &quot;Beach Beyond&quot; (1923). Her son Adrian was a barrister, captain in WW2 and a Changi and Thai-Burma Railway POW and later judge.

Turner died at Mosman on 8 April 1958 at 85. She is buried at Macquarie Park Cemetery in Sydney&#x27;s North.

==Career==
Her best-known work is her first novel, &quot;Seven Little Australians&quot; (1894), which is widely considered a classic of Australian children&#x27;s literature and was an instant hit both in Australia and overseas. It is about a family of seven children growing up in Australia. The book, together with its sequels &quot;The Family at Misrule&quot; (1895) and &quot;Little Mother Meg&quot; (1902) deal with the lives of the Woolcot family, particularly with its seven mischievous and rebellious children, in 1880s Australia. A companion to &quot;Seven Little Australians&quot;, &quot;Judy and Punch&quot; was published in 1928. Like her stepfather, the character of Captain Woolcot was a widower with six children. The book was made into a feature film in Australia in 1939 and a UK television series in 1953. A 10-episode television series was made in 1973 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Turner published a number of other books for children, short stories and poems. &quot;Three Little Maids&quot; (1900) is a strongly autobiographical novel about her family&#x27;s migration from England to Sydney, Australia. Turner wrote more than forty novels. Some were about the mischievous Woolcots. Others were serialized, like her books on &quot;the Cub&quot;, and some were stand-alone. The children she wrote about were all adventurous and independent. They frequently got themselves into sticky situations and got themselves out of them with very little to no adult help.

==Awards and honours==
Turner was awarded a number of prestigious literary awards and could be considered one of Australia&#x27;s best-loved authors. She is listed on The Australian Women&#x27;s Register. The Ethel Turner Prize for Young People&#x27;s Literature is given annually under the auspices of the New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards.

Curlewis Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Garran is named in her honour and also for her husband.

In 2020, a river-class ferry on the Sydney Ferries network was named in her honour.

<text>Gaius Rubellius Blandus was a Roman senator who lived during the Principate. Blandus was the grandson of Rubellius Blandus of Tibur, a member of the Equestrian class, who was the first Roman to teach rhetoric. He was suffect consul from August to December AD 18 with Marcus Vipstanus Gallus as his colleague. In AD 33, he married Julia Livia, granddaughter of the Roman emperor Tiberius.

==Career==
As the first member of his family to be admitted to the Senate, Blandus is considered a &quot;homo novus&quot;. His &quot;cursus honorum&quot; is documented in several inscriptions found in North Africa. Blandus began his career with the singular honor of being quaestor in service to the emperor Augustus; two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed, plebeian tribune and praetor. Two years after he served as suffect consul, he was involved with the prosecution of Aemilia Lepida, putting forward a motion in the senate to outlaw her which carried.

The primary sources disagree when Blandus was admitted to the prestigious College of Pontiffs, whether it was before or after his consulate; one inscription lists it before, while two list it afterwards. Hoffman notes Blandus &quot;probably received the priesthood late because of his low birth.&quot; Despite his background, Blandus achieved what came to be the pinnacle of a successful senatorial career, proconsular governor of Africa in 35/36. Upon returning to Rome, Blandus was selected as one of four members of a commission to assess damage a fire had caused in Rome earlier that year.

==Marriages and family==
In the year 33, Blandus married Julia Livia, one of the princesses of the Imperial house. Despite the fact that Blandus had been suffect consul in 18, the match was considered a social disaster; Tacitus includes the event in a list of &quot;the many sorrows which saddened Rome&quot;, which otherwise consisted of deaths of different prominent people. Ronald Syme identifies the historian&#x27;s reaction as &quot;the tone and sentiments of a man enslaved to the standards of class and rank.&quot; Julia was the daughter of Livilla and Drusus Julius Caesar, and the granddaughter of Emperor Tiberius. The marriage produced at least one child, a boy, Rubellius Plautus, who was considered as a rival to Emperor Nero. Two further children are uncertain: a single inscription refers to a Rubellius Drusus, who died before his third birthday, while Juvenal implies the existence of another son, also named Gaius Rubellius Blandus. He also appears to have had a daughter named Rubellia Bassa, either by Julia or possibly from an earlier marriage.

<doc id="1334983" wikidata="Q6829818" url="?curid=1334983" title="Roadkill (wrestler)">
<text>Michael DePoli (born August 10, 1976) is an American retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances in Extreme Championship Wrestling under the ring name Roadkill, where he wore traditional Amish dress and was billed from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, an area with a large Amish population.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996–2001) ===

Roadkill was trained by Taz and Perry Saturn at the House of Hardcore in 1996. Once his training was complete, he joined the ECW roster, and had his first professional match on October 18, 1996 in LuLu Temple in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania against Taz.

In December 1997, Roadkill formed an unlikely tag team with his fellow House of Hardcore graduate, Danny Doring. They were managed by Miss Congeniality until she left ECW in 1999 to join the World Wrestling Federation, and then by Elektra until she turned on them in 2000.

Doring and Roadkill quickly embarked on a two-year-long feud with Nova and Chris Chetti. This was followed by a series of feuds with the Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible), Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger, Joey Matthews and Christian York, and then Tommy Dreamer and Raven. The team won the ECW World Tag Team Championships on December 3, 2000, at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, defeating Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido. They held the titles until ECW declared bankruptcy on April 4, 2001. Doring and Roadkill were the last team to hold the ECW Tag Team Titles. Roadkill made an appearance in 2001 on &quot;The Real World: Back to New York&quot;, confronting cast member Mike Mizanin&#x27;s wrestling character The Miz, while in the Amish Roadkill character, about his wrestling antics.

=== Independent circuit (2001–2005) ===
After ECW folded, Doring and Roadkill wrestled dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment. They appeared against fellow ECW originals The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke) in early 2001 at Madison Square Garden.

Roadkill and Doring wrestled on three Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay per views when TNA was running weekly pay per views back in early 2002. They wrestled Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger, twice winning a non-title match but losing the match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. In their last TNA appearance, they wrestled Ekmo Fatu and Sonny Siaki. On December 28, 2002 Roadkill made his debut in Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW) defeating Rockin&#x27; Rebel. On December 27, 2003 he formed a team with The Blue Meanie but would lose that night against Mike Kruel and Monsta Mack. On April 17, 2004 they would be defeated by Jack Victory and Rockin&#x27; Rebel and after the match Roadkill turned on the Blue Meanie because Commissioner Raven had told him that he was a shell of his former self. He would then face Blue Meanie in the next two shows (managed by Jasmin St. Claire) defeating him on May 15, 2004 and losing to him on June 19. After the second match The Pitbulls showed up to support Roadkill but would turn on him with St. Claire after the match. Roadkill would then win three singles matches on August 21 and January 15 and February 19, 2005. Because of this singles success he would get a shot at the 3PW Heavyweight Championship against Wagner Brown on March 19 and April 9, 2005 but would be on the losing end of both those matches. However, on May 21, 2005 he defeated Brown in a Triple Threat Match that also included Simon Diamond to become the new 3PW Heavyweight Champion.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2005–2008)===
Doring and Roadkill were defeated by MNM on July 21, 2005 in a match taped for WWE&#x27;s &quot;Velocity&quot;.

Roadkill appeared at the WWE promoted ECW reunion show, ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005. He signed a contract with WWE and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling. Roadkill would continue his work with OVW and on April 5, 2006 he won the promotion&#x27;s Southern Tag Team Titles with Kasey James by defeating Deuce &#x27;n Domino and Kenny and Mikey of The Spirit Squad in a three way tag team match. While in OVW during their run as a team they picked up Michelle McCool as a valet. On the May 5, 2006 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Roadkill and James would lose to William Regal and Sylvain Grenier in a tag team dark match. They would lose the Tag Titles to Shad Gaspard and The Neighborhoodie on May 24, ending their 58-day reign as Tag Team Champions.

On the June 13 edition of &quot;ECW&quot;, Roadkill took part in a battle royal (with the winner facing John Cena at Vengeance) but was eliminated by Big Show before it was eventually won by Sabu.

Two weeks later, on the June 27 edition of &quot;ECW&quot; he faced Sabu in an Extreme Rules Match in which he lost by tapping out to the camel clutch. On the July 4 edition of &quot;ECW&quot;, Roadkill defeated Tony Mamaluke in a dark match.

He then returned to OVW where he would feud with his former partner Kasey James trading victories in tag and singles matches until James was called up to the main roster. Roadkill was then moved back up to the main roster on August 1 in a dark match loss against Stevie Richards.

After a near six-month hiatus from WWE and OVW TV, Roadkill made his return to OVW on February 17, 2007 as Braddock losing to Shawn Spears. On February 21 at the OVW TV Tapings, he defeated Mike Tolar in a dark match in which his name was tweaked to Tony Braddock. Over the next four weeks he would defeat jobbers in dark matches at OVW tapings. He would continue his win streak defeating Chris Rombola in a televised match. However, this would end as he would be defeated by Nick Nemeth in a 3-Way match that also involved Jacob Duncan.

After an 8-month hiatus from WWE TV he returned under the name of &quot;Antoni Polaski&quot; and defeated Val Venis on the April 30 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; in a match taped for &quot;Heat&quot; and on the May 4 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; he would defeat Funaki in a match taped for &quot;Velocity&quot;.

He would then return to OVW at the TV Tapings on May 9 defeating Mike Hutter in a dark match. On May 30 at the TV Tapings, Polaski was entered into a tournament to see who would face The Miz at Six Flags on June 8. Polaski would defeat Chet the Jett in the first round and Jake Hager in the semifinals but lose to Atlas DaBone in the final round.

On June 13 at the OVW TV Tapings, Polaski would defeat Chet the Jett to earn the right to challenge Santino Marella for the Intercontental Championship in his first major WWE Title match. On June 22 at OVW Six Flags, he would challenge Marella for the title.

After this Polaski began participating in $2500 Bodyslam Challenges, where if someone could Bodyslam him, he would give them $2500. After defeating jobbers, Jacob Duncan beat him by disqualification thus starting a feud between the two. On July 18 at the OVW TV Tapings, he and Duncan participated in an OVW Royal Rumble to see who would fight John Cena at OVW Six Flags on July 17, but it was won by Shawn Spears. Polaski would defeat Duncan three times in a $2500 Bodyslam Challenge but on August 10 at OVW Six Flags, Duncan would become the first person to defeat Polaski in such a challenge. They would continue to feud with indecisive endings like disqualification and double count outs until they had their final match on October 31 at OVW TV Tapings where Duncan defeated Polaski in a Halloween Hardcore Match.

He would then start to team with Vladimir Kozlov with moderate success before going back to singles matches. His last match on OVW TV was on January 2, 2008, where he defeated Lupe Viscara. He would then have his final match for WWE challenging OVW Heavyweight Champion Matt Sydal for the title at a house show in a losing effort.

Roadkill was released from WWE on February 4, 2008. When Depoli was released from WWE, he retired from professional wrestling.

=== House of Hardcore (2012) ===
On October 6, 2012, 4 years after being released from WWE, Roadkill wrestled again with Doring, defeating F.B.I. in the first House of Hardcore show.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
Roadkill used the character of an Amish from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, known by the nicknames &quot;The Angry Amish Warrior&quot;, &quot;The Angry Amish Chicken Plucker&quot; and &quot;The Killmeister&quot; and used Soul Coughing&#x27;s song &quot;Super Bon Bon&quot; as his entrance theme song in ECW.

<doc id="1334997" wikidata="Q617338" url="?curid=1334997" title="Apala">
<text>Apala (or akpala) is a music genre originally developed by the Yoruba people of Nigeria, during the country&#x27;s history as a colony of the British Empire. It is a percussion-based style that originated in the late 1930s. The rhythms of apala grew more complex over time, and have influenced the likes of Cuban music, whilst gaining popularity in Nigeria. It has grown less religious centered over time.

Apala music is an offshoot of Wéré music.

Instruments include a rattle (sekere), thumb piano (agidigbo) and a bell (agogô), as well as two or three talking drums.

Ayinla Omowura and Haruna Ishola - amongst others - were notable performers of apala music, these two icons played a major role in popularising the genre. It is distinct from, older than, and more difficult to master than fuji music. Although fuji music remains one of the popular form of traditional music amongst Yorubas in Nigeria, apala is still very popular amongst Muslims of the Yoruba tribe.

== Styles ==

=== Apala fusion, apala pop, apala trap and street pop ===
Variant styles of apala include apala pop, apala trap, and apala-fusion, with musical artists such as Terry Apala, Olamide, DJ Tunez and Seyi Vibez being prominent figures associated with apala-centered musical styles. Street pop, also known as street hop, is a genre that emerged in Nigeria in the 21st century. It blends experimental rap with vocal performance, integrating elements of Nigerian hip hop, Nigerian street music, and contemporary African genres. Street pop incorporates aspects of Western music, and its sound is notably influenced by apala music.

<text>Christian Emeka Okoye (; born August 16, 1961) is a Nigerian–American former professional football fullback who played for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL) from 1987 to 1992. Nicknamed &quot;the Nigerian Nightmare&quot;, he was known for his powerful running style and ability to break tackles. His six-season NFL career produced an NFL rushing champion title in 1989, first-team All-Pro honors in 1989, second-team All-Pro honors in 1991, two Pro Bowl appearances in 1989 and 1991, and three playoff appearances. He ended his NFL career due to multiple injuries. He was inducted into the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame in 2000. He is also notable for not having ever played football until the age of 23, but later leading the NFL in rushing at age 28.

==College career==
A member of the Igbo people, Okoye was born in Enugu, Nigeria. He arrived in the United States at age 21 and did not play American football until age 23, when he joined the squad at California&#x27;s Azusa Pacific University. He excelled in track and field, winning seven college titles in the shot put, discus, and hammer throw. The first time he attended an American football game, he found the game boring.

After the Nigerian government declined Okoye for the Olympics in track and field, he sought other activities and began playing American football. Initially, he did not enjoy the roughness of the game and considered quitting, but friends convinced him to continue playing. His speed (4.45-seconds in the 40-yard dash) was unusual for someone his size (6&#x27;1&quot; and 260 lbs), and this rare combination of talents led to his selection by the Kansas City Chiefs in the second round of the 1987 NFL draft.

==Professional career==
In his rookie year, Okoye rushed for 660 yards on 157 carries. The following year, a thumb injury limited him to nine games, and he finished the season with 473 yards.

In 1989, Okoye had by far his best statistical season, leading the league in both rushing attempts (370) and rushing yards (1,480), becoming the first Chiefs player to lead the NFL in rushing. Though the Chiefs missed the playoffs, Okoye was selected by UPI as the American Football Conference&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Year and earned entry to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii.

The remainder of Okoye&#x27;s career was marked by a nagging knee injury, which limited him to 805 yards and a 3.3 yard average per carry in 1990. Though his 1991 performance (1,031 yards and 4.6 yards per carry) earned him his second Pro Bowl appearance, his carries in 1992 were largely limited to goal-line situations. His last carry as a professional football running back was an 8-yard touchdown.

On August 25, 1993, Chiefs placed him on injured reserve before the regular season began due to knee injuries. He underwent surgeries on both knees and was released on an injury settlement that September. He went home to California to continue rehabilitating his knee. He intended to work out for other teams before ultimately retiring. He has stated that he ended his NFL career because he became tired of practice, and that he considered football to be a job.

Okoye retired as the all-time rushing leader of the Chiefs, having amassed 4,897 yards, 1,246 attempts, and 14 games with at least 100 yards rushing, in his six seasons. Those team records have since been surpassed by Priest Holmes. His 40 career rushing touchdowns as a member of the Chiefs trail only Holmes and Marcus Allen. His Chiefs records for carries in a game and rushing attempts in a season were surpassed by Larry Johnson. Okoye was the team MVP in 1989, and was enshrined in the Chiefs Hall of Fame in 2000.

Okoye is well known amongst video game enthusiasts for his appearance in &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; (1991), in which he is nearly impossible to tackle.

==NFL career statistics==


==Post-NFL career==
Okoye was an investor in the Golden Baseball League and owned Okoye Health and Fitness, a company that sells nutritional supplements. He appeared as a boxer on the FX Network&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot; special. He founded the California Sports Hall of Fame, of which he is president.

He appeared on the CBS reality show &quot;Pirate Master&quot; and was voted off by his shipmates on the second episode for his slow speed in the Expedition, receiving no gold. He appeared on &quot;Pros vs Joes&quot; in its third season.

The Christian Okoye Foundation sponsors the Ontario Mills 5K and 10K race, benefiting local after-school athletic programs in the Inland Empire.

Okoye is part of the ownership team of the Kansas City Goats, an indoor football team that plays in The Arena League.

==Personal life==
As a child in Nigeria, Okoye became good friends with Olympian Innocent Egbunike. When Egbunike began attending Azusa Pacific, he recommended Okoye for his discus abilities to track and field coaches, who offered Okoye a scholarship.

Okoye married his soulmate Lauren Brown in 1990, and divorced in 1991.

<text>Scalextric is a brand of slot car racing sets which first appeared in the late 1950s. Scalextric was invented by engineer B. Fred Francis, when he added an electric motor to the &quot;Scalex&quot; tin cars that were produced by Minimodels Ltd, his own company. The first &quot;Scalextric&quot; were first made in Havant, Hampshire, in 1956. Hornby Hobbies acquired the company in 1968.

== History ==
The forerunner to Scalextric was &quot;Scalex&quot;, which Francis first produced through the company Minimodels Ltd which he had founded in 1947. The company was based in London and made tinplate toys and models. Early products included the Startex toy car range and the very popular Scalex, which was introduced in 1952. Scalex was a range of toy racing cars with clockwork motors which were activated by pulling out the steering wheel.

The first model in the Scalex line was the Jaguar XK120. These 1:32 scale models had some unique features, including a clockwork motor which was not wound by a key but by a &#x27;fifth wheel&#x27; device. This wheel is found under the chassis behind the front axle, and works by pressing the car down on a hard surface and being pulled backwards. This wound the clockwork motor and when the car was released it shot forward at speed. The Scalex range expanded to include six cars: the MG TF, Austin-Healey 100, Aston Martin DB2, Jaguar 2.4 Saloon, Maserati 250F and Ferrari 375. The last two were in a slightly different 1:28 scale. Later cars also featured a steerable front axle which could be set at an angle and the cars would then run in an arc.

In 1952, Minimodels moved to a larger factory in New Lane, Havant to meet the growing demand for the toy cars. At the peak of its popularity, over 7,000 Scalex models were being produced weekly. By 1956, the novelty of clockwork racing cars had worn off and sales began to fall. Eventually the future of the company and its one hundred employees was threatened.

In an attempt to revive his company&#x27;s flagging fortunes, Fred Francis began to look at alternatives. He was inspired by seeing model car racing tracks, but wanted to develop the player&#x27;s control of the car so as to increase the sense of competition. He experimented by putting small electric motors into Scalex cars and running them on model railway track. Next he introduced rubber slotted track and gave the cars a &#x27;gimbal&#x27; wheel to pick up the electric current in the groove of the track. Original tin-plate cars had one hard plastic rear wheel and one rubber-tyred wheel, which gave different handling characteristics for left and right corners. Power was supplied by batteries hidden in a little cardboard hut, with players having their own on-off button to control their cars.

&quot;Scalex - electric&quot;, became &quot;Scalextric&quot;, and was unveiled at the Harrogate Toy Fair in January 1957 to immediate acclaim. It appealed to both adults and children as it combined speed, competition and the glamour of Formula One motor racing. Demand for the toy was immense and the Minimodels factory struggled to keep up with the orders.

In 1958, Fred Francis sold the Minimodels company to Lines Brothers (who operated as &quot;Tri-ang&quot;). The popularity of Scalextric continued. In 1960, plastic bodies replaced the original tinplate, and in 1961, production moved to a new factory in the Leigh Park area of Havant. By 1964, Scalextric was being advertised as &#x27;the most complete model motor racing system in the world&#x27;.

Production of Scalextric was transferred to Rovex in 1968 (although the Minimodels factory remained open until the early 1970s). , it is owned by Hornby Hobbies of England.

== Products ==


At the beginning of the 21st century, Scalextric track underwent a major redesign to make it easier to assemble. The new design is known as Scalextric Sport and can be connected to the original track using special adaptor pieces. The new track was designed to be compatible with all earlier 1:32 cars.

In 2004 &quot;Scalextric Sport Digital&quot; (SSD) was introduced, which allows up to four digital cars to be raced in a single slot. The cars can change from one slot to another using special slot-lane change tracks, the lane change or otherwise being controlled by a button on the throttle. Sport Digital cars will run on analogue layouts without modification, but analogue cars require a digital decoder to be installed before they can run on a digital layout.

In late 2010, Scalextric released a revised six-car digital powerbase, C7042. This powerbase includes a separate screen which aids set-up and also displays race information such as lap times. The company worked closely with customers when developing the new system. The result includes features such as yellow flag options for dealing with crashed cars, ghost cars to race against which can run and change lanes automatically, and the ability to race in analogue mode for older models that have not been converted to digital.

=== Micro Scalextric ===

Micro Scalextric (or MicroScalextric, as appears on product boxes) was launched on 1 February 1994 (then known as Scalextric Micro MR-1) at the Olympia toy fair. It became available to the public in October of that year and used a much smaller track geometry to the standard Scalextric product. Many of the Micro MR-1 models were re-badged products manufactured by Marchon, Inc. In 1995, again at the Olympia toy fair, a new track system was introduced along with new vehicles. At the same time Scalextric Micro MR-1 was re-branded as Micro Scalextric. The Micro Scalextric range is aimed at children four years of age or older and has a scale of 1:64 and is often, incorrectly, described as HO scale (1:87). There is also a &#x27;My first Scalextric&#x27; range, aimed at 3-year olds. In February 2019 a new track system was introduced. Warner Bros have licensed a number of Looney Tunes characters for use in the Micro Scalextric range of products. The latest (2019) range Micro Scalextric slot car motors run on 9v, which is different to earlier Micro Scalextric vehicles.

== Sets ==

Scalextric is typically sold as a set containing enough track to make a circuit, the necessary power supply and throttles, and two cars. The cars are usually based on real vehicles from Formula 1, A1 Grand Prix, NASCAR, rallying, touring, or Le Mans, or based on ordinary road-going cars. A number of novelty sets have been produced, such as horse racing sets and 360-degree sets. The latter, produced sporadically since the 1960s, have a specially made guide that enables the car to run back the way it has come by spinning through 180 degrees.

Standard track consists of straights of various lengths and corners of different radii and degree of turn. Special track includes several different styles of chicane, cross-over tracks, crossroad track and humpback bridge. Novelty pieces of track have included pit lane tracks, Le Mans start, blow-out track and loop-the-loop tracks.

There are five generations of 1:32 scale Scalextric track:
#Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 1): This was made from rubber with thin, vertical electrical connectors, and held together with separate metal clips. This track had white lines between the lanes. Track produced during the &#x27;Minimodels era&#x27; was slightly glossy, and curved sections had side protrusions to allow for the attachment of the supplied crash barrier. Later &#x27;Triang era&#x27; Mk 1 track dispensed with these, possibly because they thwarted future additions like outer radius curves. The later iteration had a more realistic matt finish to its road surface. The earliest track had a dedicated &#x27;power straight&#x27; for the connections to each lane, whereas the later one used power clips that were held in place between the contacts of any two track sections including curves. It was during this transition that the original on/off button control gave way to hand-held plungers with a greater degree of speed control.
# Original Scalextric Track (Mk. 2): Released in 1962, the material became plastic, electrical connections were through wider, horizontal pins, and the track was held together by two integrated circular, spoon-shaped pins and sockets moulded into each end. Converter pieces were available to link the two types. It is now known as Classic track. Classic track is compatible with another leading brand, SCX&#x27;s classic track.
# Scalextric Sport: Released in 2001, another plastic track, but with a smoother surface. The track connectors are square and slot into place unlike the ring shaped Classic track ones. Converter pieces are available to link to Classic track.
# Scalextric Digital: Released in 2004, Scalextric Digital is compatible with Sport. It allows up to 6 cars on a 2 lane track at one time, with each car fully controllable. This was a feature previously unavailable from Scalextric.
# Scalextric Start: Released in 2010, Scalextric Start aims to be a basic track for children. It has only one type of straight and corner, and each set can be made up into various layouts; the cars included in the sets are fantasy models, which reduce manufacturers&#x27; licensing costs, and a converter track piece is available to allow cars to cross from Start track to Sport and back again.

== Design ==

Most Scalextric models are 1:32 scale, though between 1968 and 1970 Super 124 cars and track were manufactured at 1:24 scale. In 1994 Micro Scalextric at 1:64 scale was introduced. Cars and track are not compatible between scales.

In addition to various types of cars, Scalextric vehicles have included motorbikes, sidecars, go-karts, pickup trucks, SUVs, racing trucks, articulated trucks, horses, skateboards and bicycles.

Scalextric is controlled with a hand-held plunger, connected by wire to a connector on the set. A set normally has two to six plungers included. Mounted in the track (for each lane) are two metal rails, which for Analogue carry the DC current from the controllers, or for Digital have constant AC current passed through them, in either case picked up by two metal braids or plates on the underside of the racing cars.

== Licensees and derivatives ==

Many other manufacturers, including the likes of &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Slot.it&quot;, &quot;SCX&quot;, &quot;Airfix&quot;/&quot;MRRC&quot;, &quot;Carrera&quot; and &quot;Ninco,&quot; produce cars that can run on Scalextric track with minor or no modification.

In Spain, Hornby Scalextric is marketed under the brand &quot;Superslot&quot;, as the &quot;Scalextric&quot; brand is owned there by Scale Competition Xtreme, whose products are sold internationally under the SCX brand. Whilst there are some common standards, parts of the two ranges, particularly in their digital offerings, are not compatible.

== TV and film licensing ==

Since the 1960s, Scalextric have offered TV and film tie-ins, beginning with the now rare and valuable James Bond 007 set, featuring an Aston Martin with action features as shown in the film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Even the &#x27;baddie&#x27; car in this set, a Mercedes, had action features of its own, whilst the set also sported many other unique action points and props.

It was some time before Scalextric returned to licensing in the 1970s, first with &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (the 1970s series), which had specially liveried TR7 cars and white track. Then, in the 1980s, came the original TV series based &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and then Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; film.

Since then the franchises have grown to include &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, The &quot;Transformers&quot; movie, &quot;James Bond&quot; 007 films &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;Skyfall&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (models from both the original and re-made films), &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the Pixar/Disney movie &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

Scalextric produced a &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; &quot;General Lee&quot; car and subsequently a twin car pack with licensing from the &quot;Fast and the Furious&quot; film franchise.

Scalextric licensed the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; brand from Electronic Arts and has produced a set based on the popular video game series.

On 22 November 2004, thieves stole 2,500 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Scalextric sets from the back of a lorry which was parked near services on the M2 motorway in England.

== In popular culture==

In 2009, BBC &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter James May announced plans to recreate the full length Brooklands racing track using Scalextric track and cars. This was undertaken with a team of 350 volunteers building the track from an uncounted number of pieces of Scalextric track, navigating ponds and roads, closely following the route of the old Brooklands track. This event broke the Guinness World Record for the longest ever Scalextric track in the world, intended to measure the original of the original Brooklands circuit but in reality recording in length, because of the need to navigate modern features that block the original course. The episode was first shown on BBC2 on 17 November 2009 as part of &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot;.

<text>Jean-Marie Camille Guérin (; 22 December 18729 June 1961) was a French veterinarian, bacteriologist and immunologist who, together with Albert Calmette, developed the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), a vaccine for immunization against tuberculosis.

==Biography==
Camille Guérin was born in Poitiers to a family of modest means. His father died of tuberculosis in 1882 (as well as his wife, in 1918). He studied veterinary medicine at the Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d&#x27;Alfort from 1892 to 1896, working, while a student, as an assistant to pathologist Edmond Nocard (1850–1903).

In 1897, he joined the Institut Pasteur de Lille (Lille, France) and started to work with its director, French physician, bacteriologist and immunologist Albert Calmette (1863–1933). He started as a technician in charge of preparing Calmette&#x27;s serum (antivenom against snake bites) and the vaccine against smallpox. He considerably improved the production techniques of the latter by using rabbits as intermediate hosts and developed a method to quantify the remaining virulence of these vaccines.

At Lille, he was promoted to Head of Laboratory in 1900. Thereafter, from 1905 to 1915, and from 1918 to 1928 he devoted himself to the research on a vaccine against tuberculosis, in close association with Calmette, until Calmette&#x27;s death in 1933.

He discovered in 1905 that the bovine tuberculosis bacillum, the &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot;, could immunize the animals without causing the disease. Henceforth, he and Calmette developed ways of attenuate the pathogenic activity of Mycobacterium, using successive transferrals of culture. In 1908, after successfully obtaining an immunologically active preparation that could be used to produce a vaccine, he published with Calmette the results of what was named the BCG.

In 1919 he was promoted again, this time to Head of Services. Finally, in 1921, after 230 passages of the BCG culture, they obtained an effective vaccine that could be used in humans. In 1928 he moved to Paris to become the director of the Tuberculosis Service at the Pasteur Institute.

In 1939 he became vice-president of the &quot;Comité National de Défense contre la Tuberculose&quot; (&quot;National Defense Committee against Tuberculosis&quot;). In 1948 Guérin was chairman of the First International Congress on BCG. He was also President of the Veterinary Academy of France (1949), and President of the Academy of Medicine (1951). In 1955, the French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Scientific Grand Prix.

He died aged 88, in the Hôpital Pasteur in Paris.

<doc id="1335029" wikidata="Q4909983" url="?curid=1335029" title="Bill Maas">
<text>William Thomas Maas (born March 2, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the Kansas City Chiefs (1984–1992), and the Green Bay Packers (1993). Maas was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1986 and 1987. In 1984 Maas was named the NFL Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. He worked as a commentator for Fox Sports from 1996 to 2007. From 1998 to 2001, he served as studio anchor and game analyst for NFL games.

==Early life==
Bill&#x27;s early years were spent in suburban Philadelphia where he grew up alongside his sister Lizanne (Annie), his brother Murray Xavier, and his adopted Vietnamese brother, Ngo.

Bill Maas played football at Marple Newtown High School but his athletic skills were overlooked, in part because of his team&#x27;s lack of success on the field. During his senior year, the Tigers finished with a 1–9 record. The only school that expressed interest in him was the University of Pittsburgh, a college football powerhouse.

==College career==

Maas spearheaded Pitt&#x27;s defensive fronts of the early 1980s with his play at tackle. In 1980, he was part of an elite Pitt team that included future NFL stars Tim Lewis, Jimbo Covert, Chris Doleman, Dan Marino, Russ Grimm, Mark May, Hugh Green, and Rickey Jackson.

He established himself early when as a freshman he blocked a punt and recorded a sack in Pitt&#x27;s 1980 Gator Bowl victory over South Carolina. Maas then became a starter for his remaining three years with the Panthers, earning first-team All-America honors in 1982 and third-team in 1983. Maas played in the East–West Shrine Game.

==Professional career==

Maas was the Chiefs&#x27; first-round draft pick in 1984, the fifth player taken overall. He lived up to his first-round status, being named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year despite missing two games. After a career-high seven sacks in 1985, Maas matched that total the next season and was awarded his first Pro Bowl nod. He went back again to the Pro Bowl in the strike-shortened 1987 season after getting six sacks and scoring a touchdown off a fumble recovery. Maas got off to a fast start in 1988, getting four sacks and a safety in his first seven games. He then was injured in the eighth game and missed the rest of the season. The 1989 season was the first year in his career he did not have a sack, as it was shortened to 10 games because of injury. Maas did score the last touchdown of his career off a fumble. Kansas City moved him to defensive end in 1990. He had 5.5 sacks and a safety that season. After an injury-filled 1992 season, he joined the Green Bay Packers. He spent most of the year backing up John Jurkovic at nose tackle.

His 40 career sacks is tied with Mike Bell as the eighth most in Kansas City Chiefs history, as of 2020, and is the most by either a defensive tackle or nose tackle. Bill Maas is the first nose tackle in Chiefs history to make the Pro Bowl. He was the first Chief ever to win a Rookie of the Year Award. During his career, Maas won acclaim for his relentless pass rushing ability and was selected twice for the Pro Bowl, as well as being named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.

After retiring from pro football, he spent 12 years broadcasting NFL games for Fox Sports.

==Legal problems==
On July 6, 2007, Maas was arrested for drug and weapons possession after a traffic stop in East Peoria, Illinois. He was released from jail two days later.

The USA Today reported August 7, 2007:
Maas, 45, and a passenger in his Hummer, Sarah J. Murphy, 27, were arrested late Friday by Illinois State Police. During the stop on Illinois Route 116, police indicated that Maas seemed nervous, which prompted police to request a search of the vehicle, to which Maas consented.

The search turned up a .22-caliber revolver, five grams of suspected marijuana, six grams of suspected cocaine and 28 pills of Ecstasy, according to police. Both Maas and Murphy were charged with possession of a controlled substance and possession of marijuana. Maas was also booked on a charge of unlawful use of a weapon.

On September 5, 2007, Maas was questioned and released following an incident at Kansas City International Airport in which authorities reportedly found a loaded 9mm Glock in a bag brought by the former football player to the airport before attempting to board a plane. The gun was confiscated at a screening station and Maas was taken to the airport police station for questioning, at which point he claimed to have picked up the wrong bag before coming to the airport.

<doc id="1335032" wikidata="Q784574" url="?curid=1335032" title="Inconnu Independent Art Group">
<text>Inconnu Art Group (later the Inconnu Independent Art Group) is a Hungarian group of maverick fine artists from the communist and postcommunist eras. The original members were Bokros Péter, Molnár Tamás, Csécsei Mihály, Mészáros Bánk, Letenyei József, Sipos Mihály, Kopács Kovács Miklós, and Morva Ibolya. The foundation date of the group is unknown, but as Péter Bokros remembers (in 2005), they started their common activities in 1978, Cegléd, but the name &quot;inconnu&quot; came later.

They took part in (often illegal) exhibitions and performances in the eighties; and were considered as an important part of the Hungarian democratic opposition both in Hungary and in abroad. From 1979, they were subject to serious manhunt by the Hungarian authorities, and they were continuously followed and eyed by secret agents.

In 1986, the materials of their exhibition The Fighting City was confiscated and destroyed by the police. The artworks, ironically, are only known from the photos taken by the police before shredding them.

In 2019, the history of the Inconnu Group was critically analyzed by &quot;the Left Turn, Right Turn. Artistic and Political Radicalism of late Socialism in Hungary - The Orfeo and the Inconnu Groups&quot; exhibition at the Blinken Open Society Archives of Budapest. In 2021 under the same title an extensive comparative article was published that iquires the social biographies of the Inconnu members.

==Post-communism==
After 1994, some members became active again and continued – in their words – their &quot;anti-communist&quot; drive, now against the (post-communist socialist) governments (led by Hungarian Socialist Party, MSzP). Other members created independent art and to explore the &quot;rubberized horror of global powers&quot;.

<doc id="1335038" wikidata="Q2092070" url="?curid=1335038" title="Albert Dekker">
<text>Thomas Albert Ecke Van Dekker (December 20, 1905 – May 5, 1968) was an American actor and politician known for his roles in &quot;Dr. Cyclops&quot;, &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946), &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Dekker was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the only child of Thomas and Grace Ecke Van Dekker. He attended Richmond Hill High School, where he appeared in stage productions. He then attended Bowdoin College, where he majored in pre-med with plans to become a doctor. On the advice of a friend, he decided to pursue acting as a career. He made his professional acting debut with a Cincinnati stock company in 1927. Within a few months, Dekker was featured in the Broadway production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Marco Millions&quot;.

After a decade of theatrical appearances, Dekker transferred to Hollywood in 1937 and made his first film, 1937&#x27;s &quot;The Great Garrick&quot;. He spent most of the rest of his acting career in the cinema but returned to the stage from time to time.

He replaced Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the original production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and during a five-year stint back on Broadway in the early 1960s, he played the Duke of Norfolk in Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;.

Dekker appeared in some 70 films from the 1930s to the 1960s, but his four famous screen roles were as a mad scientist in the 1940 horror film &quot;Dr. Cyclops&quot;, as a criminal mastermind in 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Killers&quot;, as a dangerous dealer in atomic fuel in the 1955 &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, and as an unscrupulous railroad detective in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s Western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, released in 1969. In 1959, he played a Texas Ranger in &quot;The Wonderful Country&quot;. He was rarely cast in romantic roles, but in the film &quot;Seven Sinners&quot;, featuring a romance between Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne, Dietrich sails off with Dekker&#x27;s character at the end of the film. Dekker was an often memorable guest star – usually a villain – in numerous TV series from the 1950s through 1968, such as &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The Man From UNCLE&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and &quot;I Spy&quot;. Dekker&#x27;s role as Pat Harrigan in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was his last screen appearance; he died over a year before it was released.

==Personal life==
On April 4, 1929, Dekker married former actress Esther Guerini. The couple had two sons, and named them John and Benjamin, and their daughter whom they named Jan, but they divorced in 1964.

In April 1957, Dekker&#x27;s 16-year-old son, John, fatally shot himself with a .22 rifle. This happened at the family&#x27;s home in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The entire year he had been working on a silencer for the rifle. That death was ruled accidental.

In his book-length account of the production of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, writer W.K. Stratton describes Dekker as &quot;completely nuts,&quot; and possibly the most troubled person on a set filled with eccentrics. According to actor R.G. Armstrong, Dekker showed up to the remote Mexican shooting location of that film in 1968 with a 13-year-old girl he described as his wife, telling people (falsely) that he was a medical doctor, and that after filming he would retire from acting to help impoverished Africans.

===Politics===
Dekker&#x27;s off-screen interest in politics led to his winning a seat in the California State Assembly for the 57th Assembly District in 1944. Dekker served as a Democratic member of the Assembly until 1946.

During the McCarthy era, he was an outspoken critic of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s tactics. As a result, Dekker was blacklisted in Hollywood and spent most of the blacklist period working on Broadway rather than in Hollywood (but he did work throughout the 1950s, including a part in &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;).

==Death==
On May 5, 1968, Dekker was found dead in his Hollywood home by his fiancée, fashion model and future &quot;Love Boat&quot; creator Jeraldine Saunders. He had hanged himself in his bathroom while dressed in women&#x27;s lingerie. His body was covered in explicit words and drawings in red lipstick.

Money and camera equipment were missing, but there was no sign of forced entry. Police, calling it &quot;quite an unusual case&quot;, originally said it was suicide but the deputy coroner found no evidence of foul play nor any indication that he planned to take his life and ruled his death accidental, the result of autoerotic asphyxiation. Dekker was cremated, and his remains interred at the Garden State Crematory in North Bergen, New Jersey.

Dekker has a star in the motion picture category on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6620 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Aerial perspective, or atmospheric perspective, refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the contrast between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less saturated and shift toward the background colour, which is usually bluish, but may be some other colour under certain conditions (for instance, reddish around sunrise or sunset).

==History==

Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style frescos, one of the Pompeian Styles, dating as early as 30 BCE. Notable examples include the Garden Room Fresco from the Villa of Livia in Prima Porta, Italy, and the first century Pompeian fresco &quot;Paris on Mount Ida&quot;.

With varying degrees of accuracy, explanations of the effects of atmospheric perspective were written by polymaths such as Leon Battista Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as &quot;The Annunciation&quot;, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, and &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, introducing a technique to paint the effect accurately that was adopted by his followers, the Leonardeschi. Art historians note that it is lacking in works by some artists of the same period, such as Raphael, although he adopted the use of sfumato that was introduced by Leonardo at the same time. 

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the fifteenth century.

==Optics==
The major component affecting the appearance of objects during daylight is scattering of light, called sky light, into the line of sight of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke. Scattering adds the sky light as a veiling luminance onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Sky light usually contains more light of short wavelength than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal visual acuity to see fine details is determined by contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity is the reciprocal of the smallest contrast for which a person can see a sine-wave grating. A person&#x27;s contrast sensitivity function is contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about four cycles per degree of visual angle. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about forty cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it fine details. Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them already is poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

Reducing the contrast is not the same as blurring an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, &quot;aerial perspective&quot; or &quot;atmospheric perspective&quot; refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects. This technique was introduced in painting by Leonardo da Vinci to portray what was observed in nature and evident in his interest in optics. 

The technique allows a painter to capture the effect that atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the contrast between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less saturated and shift toward the colour of the atmosphere, which is bluish when sunlit, but will shift to other colours under certain conditions (for instance, reddish around sunrise and sunset or saturated during fog). 

(One caution: in common speech, the words &quot;perspective&quot; and &quot;viewpoint&quot; tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an aerial viewpoint, such as that forming the basis of the aerial landscape genre. The example by Frans Koppelaar pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since apparently, the observer is standing on the ground.) As such, the term atmospheric perspective can be understood to better describe how properties of the scene&#x27;s atmosphere effect the appearance of an object as it moves further from the viewer.

<doc id="1335053" wikidata="Q7337394" url="?curid=1335053" title="River Ember">
<text>The River Ember is a short river in the north of Surrey, England — a channel of the River Mole which splits in two south of Island Barn Reservoir, between East Molesey and Lower Green, Esher. The Ember, the larger channel, flows in an easterly and then northerly direction around the reservoir, past part of Esher; the Mole flows around the other side past West Molesey. The two rivers then flow side by side approximately north east and merge 400 metres before joining the River Thames at the eastern end of East Molesey opposite Hampton Court Palace on the south side of the last non-tidal reach, which is above Teddington Lock.

==History==
The Ember was until the 1930s a distributary. As such the River Mole was similar to two other Thames tributaries, the Colne and the Cherwell, in having more than one channel in its lowest stretch.

The River Mole flowed into the River Thames separately slightly further upstream at the point where Hampton Court Bridge crosses the river, with the land between the Mole and Ember being known as Cigarette Island. However, during the early 1930s, when Hampton Court Way and the bridge were built, the River Mole was redirected to flow into the River Ember forming a widened and straightened channel. There have been further alterations to the courses of these two rivers in a major flood prevention scheme since serious flooding in the area in 1947 and 1968.

Close to its start, Ember Mill stood on an island in the Ember reached from a footbridge at the end of Orchard Lane by Imber Court, Thames Ditton. The mill was demolished around 1837 and the sluices and waterfalls on either side are all that remain to indicate the site. The mill was originally a corn mill but was later used for manufacturing brass and iron wire. This part of the Ember is bypassed by the new channel of the flood prevention scheme, but a small flow runs into the old course to keep it looking largely as it used to.

==Fishing==
There is a section of the river at Old Cow Common, East Molesey, where there is free fishing for pike (to 15 pounds), bream, carp, chub, dace, perch, roach, catfish (to 22 lb), tench, bullhead, eel, orfe, goldfish and rudd.

<text>&quot;&#x27;Ashraf&quot;
&#x27; () is an Arabic name meaning &#x27;most honorable one&#x27; or &#x27;very noble&#x27;. It is used by many Arabs and non-Arabs regardless of their religious affiliation, both Christians and Muslims alike. In French-speaking contexts the transliteration is Achraf.

The name is not to be confused with the word (, with a long second &quot;ā&quot;) which is the plural of the word , denoting the descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Although both words share the same root, () is not normally used as a proper name. Its singular (also &#x27;Shareef&#x27;, &#x27;Sherif&#x27;, etc.), on the other hand, is used as a proper name.

== The Teaching Awards Trust ==
The Teaching Awards were established by Lord Puttnam CBE in 1998 and are managed by an independent charity, the Teaching Awards Trust. The Teaching Awards Trust aims to celebrate excellence and promote best practice in education. The Oscar award winning actress Emma Thompson became the president of the Teaching Awards in 2009. She said &quot;I owe so much of what I&#x27;ve done to my fantastic teachers at school and at university and it&#x27;s exciting to join in celebrating what is probably the most important profession of them all&quot;.

== Goals ==
The Teaching Awards Trust was initially established to regenerate national pride in the teaching profession. The Trust has been successful in achieving this aim and has repositioned itself as a centre of excellence in education with the following aims:
* promote teaching as a career
* disseminate best practice
* encourage the involvement of other stakeholders in education
* engage with a wider audience at a national level 

== Profile ==
The Awards are supported by all the main political parties, the Department for Education in England, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government as well as all the national teaching unions and associations.

The Teaching Awards Trust works in partnership with the BBC. The UK Ceremony is a produced in conjunction with the BBC and is shown on BBC Two in a primetime slot as a showcase of excellence in education. During the programme, winning teachers are presented with a Plato award, designed by sculptor Glynis Owen and based on her work titled &#x27;The Thinking Man.&#x27; Examples can be seen at http://www.glynisowensculptor.co.uk.

<doc id="1335069" wikidata="Q6981479" url="?curid=1335069" title="Nautica">
<text>Nautica is an American apparel brand of Authentic Brands Group (ABG) featuring primarily men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, children&#x27;s apparel and accessories, as well as home, watches, and fragrance. Nautica was founded in 1983 by clothing designer David Chu and a partner. It was purchased for cash and stock in 1984 by State-O-Maine, a New York–based apparel company. State-O-Maine changed its name to Nautica in 1994. VF Corporation purchased Nautica in 2003.

Nautica took its name from the Latin word &quot;nauticus&quot;—which comes from the Greek word &quot;ναυτικός&quot;—for naval and in Italian language &quot;nautica&quot; means seamanship.

In March 2018, ABG announced that they would acquire Nautica from VF Corporation. The sale was completed on April 30, 2018. Since being acquired by ABG, the brand has been repositioned downmarket as an upper mid-range brand, being priced above PVH&#x27;s Izod and Ralph Lauren Corporation&#x27;s Chaps brands, but well below PVH&#x27;s Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren Corporation&#x27;s Polo Ralph Lauren brands.

In 2020, ABG acquired, after bankruptcy and liquidation, the Brooks Brothers brand name only, another brand specialising in the preppy fashion category. In the ABG portfolio, Brooks Brothers name will continue to be marketed as an upscale traditional preppy brand, while Nautica will be marketed as a more affordable upper mid-price, modern athleisure brand.

In 2021, it was announced that ABG would acquire the Izod brand from PVH, which offers several similar clothing styles to Nautica. Currently, Nautica slots above lower priced Izod and below upper priced Brooks Brothers in price.

<doc id="1335077" wikidata="Q44975" url="?curid=1335077" title="Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum">
<text>Theophylact I (before 864 – 924/925) was a medieval count of Tusculum who was the effective ruler of Rome from around 905 through to his death in 924. His descendants controlled the papacy for the next 100 years.

==Biography==
Theophylact was the hereditary count of Tusculum, a small hill town near the vicinity of Rome. He is mentioned for the first time in a document of 901 as &quot;palatine iudex&quot; (&quot;palace judge&quot;, or leader of the militia) of Emperor Louis the Blind. He remained in Rome, commanding a group of soldiers after the emperor&#x27;s return to Provence in 902, and was prominent in the overthrow of Antipope Christopher in January 904, whom he very likely ordered to be killed whilst in prison later that year. Theophylact formed an alliance with Duke Alberic I of Spoleto, and with their combined backing, Pope Sergius III was elected in Christopher&#x27;s place. During his pontificate, Theophylact became Sergius’ &quot;sacri palatii vestararius&quot; and &quot;magister militum&quot;, effectively seizing control of the city. He was also granted other honorific titles, such as &quot;senator&quot;, &quot;glorissimus dux&quot;, and &quot;dominus urbis&quot;.

Sometime between the end of Sergius III&#x27;s pontificate and the start of John X&#x27;s, Theophylact was elected the head of Rome, under the centuries-old title of &quot;Roman consul&quot; by the city&#x27;s nobility. Like the ancient office, this consulship must have been for a year only, as in 915, he is referred to as a senator only, although first among the listed nobility. In this capacity, Theophylact was able to dominate the papal electoral process, with all popes until his death in 925 chosen after he had hand-picked them.

Theophylact&#x27;s rule of Rome was shared to a large degree with his wife Theodora, who was styled &quot;senatrix&quot; and &quot;serenissima vestaratrix&quot; of Rome. It was by her suggestion that the popes who followed Sergius III, Anastasius III and Lando, were chosen by her husband for the papal see. Then in 914, she prevailed upon him to support her alleged lover as pope, having him installed as John X (although it has been suggested that John was in fact related to either Theodora or Theophylact). Theophylact worked closely with the able John X, who supported Theophylact&#x27;s overall objectives with regards to strengthening the imperial presence in Italy by supporting Berengar I of Italy. He fought alongside John X against the Saracens at the Battle of Garigliano in 915, and was the pope&#x27;s principal political support until his death in either 924 or 925.

Theophylact had two daughters with Theodora: Marozia and Theodora. In the longer term, the heirs of Theophylact, the Tusculani, were the rivals of the Crescentii in controlling Rome, and placed several popes on the Chair of St Peter. Their eventual heirs were the Colonna family.

==Reputation==
It is now believed that Theodora&#x27;s influence over Theophylact was overstated by contemporary chroniclers such as Liutprand of Cremona, who wished to exaggerate the corruption of the Roman and papal court, as a counterpoint to rulers such as Alberic I of Spoleto, and the future emperor Otto I, whom Liutprand later served. The charges of adultery against Theodora, the use of the term &quot;harlot&quot;, and the presumption that she was using her &quot;feminine wiles&quot; to prostitute herself in order to influence her husband and appoint numerous lovers to important posts were used to tarnish the rule of Theophylact and his successors. Later historians, influenced by the moral tone of this critique, described the influence of Theodora and her descendants over the papacy as the &quot;pornocracy&quot; or the &quot;Rule of the Harlots&quot;. Modern historians now instead use the term &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot; to describe the period when the papacy was under the direct control of the Roman nobility, in particular when it was under the domination of the family of Theophylact.

<text>Theodora (c. 870 – 916) was a senatrix and &quot;serenissima vestaratrix&quot; of Rome. Theodora was married to Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum. The couple shared effective rulership of Rome between 905 and her death in 916.

Her daughter, Marozia, was the alleged concubine to Pope Sergius III, and mother of Pope John XI. The latter, according to Liutprand of Cremona and the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, was fathered by Sergius. However, the annalist Flodoard (c. 894–966), a direct contemporary of Theodora&#x27;s, says John XI was the brother of Count Alberic II of Spoleto. Because Alberic II was Marozia&#x27;s son by her husband Count Alberic I of Spoleto, John was likely the son of Marozia and Alberic I.

Theodora was characterized by the aforementioned Liutprand as a &quot;shameless whore ... [who] exercised power on the Roman citizenry like a man&quot;. Liutprand, a bishop of Cremona, was known to his contemporaries and modern historians as being unfair to adversaries.

<text>Ong&#x27;s Hat is one of the earliest Internet-based secret history conspiracy theories. It was created as a piece of collaborative fiction by four core individuals, dating back to the 1980s, although the membership propagating the tale changed over time. Ong&#x27;s Hat is often cited as the first ARG on many lists of alternate reality games.

The characters were largely based in the ghost town of Ong&#x27;s Hat, New Jersey, hence the name of the project.

==History==
The threads of the story can be traced back as far as the 1980s on bulletin board systems, and via mail art networks, early zines, and faxlore. The aim was to create a fictional story line, and embed it in various media cultures to establish backstory. It may have started as an in-joke, or the first alternate reality game (ARG), a work of transmedia storytelling or as a memetic experiment, to see how far the meme could spread or a combination of all of the above. The story eventually used print, radio, television and digital media (CD-ROM, DVD, Internet, BBS) in its dissemination.

The initial ground rules acknowledged the possibility that such an experiment could end up going down darker paths, and they specifically ruled out Ong&#x27;s Hat being used for cult-like activity. Even though it is a fiction, the tale may be based on earlier works.

Joseph Matheny eventually concluded the project. &quot;GamesTM&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Ong’s Hat was more of an experiment in transmedia storytelling than what we would now consider to be an ARG but its DNA – the concept of telling a story across various platforms and new media – is evident in every alternate reality game that came after.&quot;

In 2002, Lego created an ARG for their line of toys for Canadian children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Galidor&quot; that featured some elements of the Ong&#x27;s Hat story.

==Plot==
The Ong&#x27;s Hat narrative is told in the form of conspiracy theories surrounding a group of renegade Princeton professors who had conducted quantum physics and chaos theory experiments to discover a new theory for dimensional travel using a device called &quot;the egg&quot;, and were camped out in a parallel world. Their story is introduced through two documents, &quot;Incunabula: A Catalog of Rare Books, Manuscripts &amp; Curiosa, Conspiracy Theory, Frontier Science &amp; Alternative Worlds&quot; and &quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat: Gateway to the Dimensions&quot;.

The story is said to begin in 1978 when a man named Wali Ford bought over 200 acres of forested land and set up an ashram. This ashram was built for seekers of spirituality, politics, tantra, and psychopharmacology. The ashram was a place for Princeton physicists, among other accredited scientists, to perform experiments involving interdimensional travel. It was rumored that they were trying to train the human mind to manipulate quantum physics and reality itself.

A device called The Egg was developed in the late 1980s by these scientists and physicists. This device was created as a variation of a sensory deprivation chamber, and it was used to help them determine when a wave becomes a particle. However, during a test one day, something unexpected happened: it disappeared. A young man who was inside the Egg when it disappeared explained that in the seven minutes the Egg was gone, he had traveled to another alternate dimension of the Earth. This other planet was exactly the same as Earth, but did not contain human life.

Throughout the years, they continued their experiments. However, when military efforts threatened the research being done by these physicists and scientists, they had to move their site somewhere else. Piece by piece, they moved their ashram to the other Earth. They left behind only the house where the gateway between worlds is held. The only time the people who live in the ashram return is when they need to restock supplies.

<doc id="1335092" wikidata="Q757382" url="?curid=1335092" title="Insolvency">
<text>In accounting, insolvency is the state of being unable to pay the debts, by a person or company (debtor), at maturity; those in a state of insolvency are said to be &quot;insolvent&quot;. There are two forms: cash-flow insolvency and balance-sheet insolvency.

Cash-flow insolvency is when a person or company has enough assets to pay what is owed, but does not have the appropriate form of payment. For example, a person may own a large house and a valuable car, but not have enough liquid assets to pay a debt when it falls due. Cash-flow insolvency can usually be resolved by negotiation. For example, the bill collector may wait until the car is sold and the debtor agrees to pay a penalty.

Balance-sheet insolvency is when a person or company does not have enough assets to pay all of their debts. The person or company might enter bankruptcy, but not necessarily. Once a loss is accepted by all parties, negotiation is often able to resolve the situation without bankruptcy. A company that is balance-sheet insolvent may still have enough cash to pay its next bill on time. However, most laws will not let the company pay that bill unless it will directly help all their creditors. For example, an insolvent farmer may be allowed to hire people to help harvest the crop, because &quot;not&quot; harvesting and selling the crop would be even &quot;worse&quot; for his creditors.

It has been suggested that the speaker or writer should either say technical insolvency or actual insolvency in order to always be clear where technical insolvency is a synonym for balance sheet insolvency, which means that its liabilities are greater than its assets, and actual insolvency is a synonym for the first definition of insolvency (&quot;Insolvency is the inability of a debtor to pay their debt.&quot;). While technical insolvency is a synonym for balance-sheet insolvency, cash-flow insolvency and actual insolvency are not synonyms. The term &quot;cash-flow insolvent&quot; carries a strong (but perhaps not absolute) connotation that the debtor is balance-sheet solvent, whereas the term &quot;actually insolvent&quot; does not.

==Technical definitions==

Cash-flow insolvency involves a lack of liquidity to pay debts as they fall due.

Balance sheet insolvency involves having negative net assets—where liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency is not a synonym for bankruptcy, which is a determination of insolvency made by a court of law with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency.

Accounting insolvency happens when total liabilities exceed total assets (negative net worth).

==Consequences==
The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business debt restructuring practices no longer rests on the liquidation and elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing financial distress so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business. This is known as business turnaround or business recovery. Implementing a business turnaround may take many forms, including keep and restructure, sale as a going concern, or wind-down and exit. In some jurisdictions, it is an offence under the insolvency laws for a corporation to continue in business while insolvent. In others (like the United States with its Chapter 11 provisions), the business may continue under a declared protective arrangement while alternative options to achieve recovery are worked out. Increasingly, legislatures have favored alternatives to winding up companies for good.

It can be, in several jurisdictions, grounds for a civil action or even an offence to continue to pay some creditors in preference to other creditors once a state of insolvency is reached.

==Debt restructuring==
Debt restructurings are typically handled by professional insolvency and restructuring practitioners, and are usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy.

Debt restructuring is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and financial distress, to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations.

==Government debt==
Although the term &quot;bankrupt&quot; may be used referring to a government, sovereign states do not go bankrupt. This is so because bankruptcy is governed by national law; there exists no entity to take over such a government and distribute assets to creditors. Governments &quot;can&quot; be insolvent in terms of not having money to pay obligations when they are due. If a government does not meet an obligation, it is in &quot;default&quot;. As governments are sovereign entities, creditors who hold debt of the government cannot easily seize the assets of the government to re-pay the debt (though &quot;Vulture funds&quot; often find ways to do so). The recourse for the creditor is to request to be repaid at least some of what is owed. However, in most cases, debt in default is refinanced by further borrowing or monetized by issuing more currency (which typically results in inflation or hyperinflation).

==Law==
Insolvency regimes around the world have evolved in very different ways, with laws focusing on different strategies for dealing with the insolvent. The outcome of an insolvent restructuring can be very different depending on the laws of the state in which the insolvency proceeding is run, and in many cases different stakeholders in a company may hold the advantage in different jurisdictions.

=== Anguilla ===

In Anguilla, the insolvency of individuals is regulated under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15) and corporate insolvency is governed by the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15) or the Companies Act (Cap C.65).

===Australia===

In Australia, corporate insolvency is governed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Companies can be put into Voluntary Administration, Creditors Voluntary Liquidation, and Court Liquidation. Secured creditors with registered charges are able to appoint Receivers and Receivers &amp; Managers depending on their charge.

=== British Virgin Islands ===

In the British Virgin Islands, insolvency law is primarily codified in the Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005.

===Canada===

In Canada, bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. An alternative regime is available to larger companies (or affiliated groups) under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangements Act, where total debts exceed $5 million.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, insolvency proceedings, both for companies and for natural persons, are regulated by the Insolvency Act &quot;(Insolvenzordnung),&quot; in effect since 1999 but with significant changes in 2012. The goal of insolvency law is the equal and best satisfaction of creditors.

If the interests of creditors are respected, insolvent companies are offered different ways to restructure their businesses, for example by implementing an &#x27;insolvency plan&#x27; &quot;(Insolvenzplan)&quot;. While regular insolvency proceedings are led by a court-appointed insolvency administrator, &#x27;debtor-in-possession&#x27; proceedings are common since the legislative changes in 2012.

For natural persons, the &quot;Verbraucherinsolvenzverfahren&quot; (literally &quot;insolvency proceeding for individual consumers&quot;) allows discharge of all debts after three years, if certain conditions are met.

=== Hong Kong ===

In Hong Kong, insolvency is primarily governed by the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) and the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 32H).

=== India ===

In India, bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) is the regulator for overseeing insolvency &quot;proceedings&quot; and entities like Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPA), Insolvency Professionals (IP) and Information Utilities (IU) in India.

Insolvent citizens may not contest/be appointed for any public office, nor may they participate in govt exams. They are also not allowed to emigrate out.

===Iran===
Iranian government Tax, finance and bankruptcy administration handles corporations . First insolvency law was adopted 1935. Those who claim inability are temporary exempt from debt payment.

=== Ireland ===

In Ireland, insolvency is governed by the Companies Act 2014.

=== Russia ===

In Russia, insolvency law is governed by Federal Law No. 127-FZ &quot;On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)&quot; and Federal Law No. 40-FZ &quot;On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Credit Institutions&quot;.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, owners of businesses that had at any stage traded insolvently (i.e. that had a balance-sheet insolvency) become personally liable for the business&#x27;s debts. Trading insolvently is often regarded as normal business practice in South Africa, as long as the business is able to fulfill its debt obligations when they fall due.

===Switzerland===

Under Swiss law, insolvency or foreclosure may lead to the seizure and auctioning off of assets (generally in the case of private individuals) or to bankruptcy proceedings (generally in the case of registered commercial entities).

===Turkey===
Turkish insolvency law is regulated by Enforcement and Bankruptcy Law (Code No: 2004, Original Name: İcra ve İflas Kanunu). The main concept of the insolvency law is very similar to Swiss and German insolvency laws. Enforcement methods are realizing pledged property, seizure of assets and bankruptcy.

===United Kingdom===
====Insolvency Act 1986====
In the United Kingdom, the term bankruptcy is reserved for individuals. Insolvency is defined both in terms of cash flow and in terms of balance sheet in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123, which reads in part:

A company which is insolvent may be put into liquidation (sometimes referred to as winding-up). The directors and shareholders can instigate the liquidation process without court involvement by a shareholder resolution and the appointment of a licensed Insolvency Practitioner as liquidator. However, the liquidation will not be effective legally without the convening of a meeting of creditors who have the opportunity to appoint a liquidator of their own choice. This process is known as creditors voluntary liquidation (CVL), as opposed to members voluntary liquidation (MVL) which is for solvent companies. Alternatively, a creditor can petition the court for a winding-up order which, if granted, will place the company into what is called compulsory liquidation or winding up by the court. The liquidator realises the assets of the company and distributes funds realised to creditors according to their priorities, after the deduction of costs. In the case of Sole Trader Insolvency, the insolvency options include Individual Voluntary Arrangements and Bankruptcy.

====Procedures====
It can be a civil and even a criminal offence for directors to allow a company to continue to trade whilst insolvent. However, two new insolvency procedures were introduced by the Insolvency Act 1986 which aim to provide time for the rescue of a company or, at least, its business. These are Administration and Company Voluntary Arrangement:

*Administration is a procedure to protect a company from its creditors in order for it to be able to make significant operational changes or restructuring so that it could continue as a going concern, or at least in order to achieve a better outcome for creditors than via liquidation. In contrast to Chapter 11 in the US where the directors remain in control throughout that restructuring process, in the UK an Administrator is appointed who must be a licensed Insolvency Practitioner to manage the company&#x27;s affairs to protect the creditors of the insolvent company and balance their respective interests. Unless the company itself is saved by this process, the company is subsequently put into liquidation to distribute the remaining funds.
*A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) is a legal agreement between the company and its creditors, based on paying a fixed amount lower than the outstanding actual debt. These are normally based on a monthly payment, and at the end of the agreed term the remaining debt is written-off. The CVA is managed by a Supervisor who must be a licensed Insolvency Practitioner. If the CVA fails, the company is usually put into liquidation.

One particular type of Administration that is becoming more common is called pre pack administration (more information under administration (law)). In this process, immediately after appointment the administrator completes a pre-arranged sale of the company&#x27;s business, often to its directors or owners. The process can be seen as controversial because the creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the sale. The rationale behind the device is that the swift sale of the business may be necessary or of benefit to enable a best price to be achieved. If the sale was delayed, creditors would ultimately lose out because the price obtainable for the assets would be reduced.

====Receivership====
In addition to the above-mentioned corporate insolvency procedures, a creditor holding security over an asset of the company may have the power to appoint an insolvency practitioner as administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver. The process, latterly known as administrative receivership or, in Scotland, receivership, has existed for many years and has often resulted in a successful rescue of a company&#x27;s business via a sale, but not of the company itself. Since the introduction of the collective insolvency procedure of Administration in 1986, the legislators have decided to set a shelf life on the administrative receivership or, in Scotland, receivership procedure and it is no longer possible to appoint an administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver under security created after 15 September 2003.

In individual cases the bankruptcy estate is dealt by an official receiver, appointed by the court. In some cases the file is transferred to RTLU (OR Regional Trustee Liquidator Unit) that will assess your assets and income to see if you can contribute towards paying costs of bankruptcy or even discharge part of your debts.

===United States===

Under the Uniform Commercial Code, a person is considered to be insolvent when the party has ceased to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business, or cannot pay its debts as they become due, or is insolvent within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. This is important because certain rights under the code may be invoked against an insolvent party which are otherwise unavailable.

The United States has established insolvency regimes which aim to protect the insolvent individual or company from the creditors, and balance their respective interests. For example, see Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. However, some state courts have begun to find individual corporate officers and directors liable for driving a company deeper into bankruptcy, under the legal theory of &quot;deepening insolvency&quot;.

In determining whether a gift or a payment to a creditor is an unlawful preference, the date of the insolvency, rather than the date of the legally declared bankruptcy, will usually be the primary consideration.

<doc id="1335094" wikidata="Q7291984" url="?curid=1335094" title="Random password generator">
<text>A random password generator is a software program or hardware device that takes input from a random or pseudo-random number generator and automatically generates a password. Random passwords can be generated manually, using simple sources of randomness such as dice or coins, or they can be generated using a computer.

While there are many examples of &quot;random&quot; password generator programs available on the Internet, generating randomness can be tricky, and many programs do not generate random characters in a way that ensures strong security. A common recommendation is to use open source security tools where possible, since they allow independent checks on the quality of the methods used. Simply generating a password at random does not ensure the password is a strong password, because it is possible, although highly unlikely, to generate an easily guessed or cracked password. In fact, there is no need at all for a password to have been produced by a perfectly random process: it just needs to be sufficiently difficult to guess.

A password generator can be part of a password manager. When a password policy enforces complex rules, it can be easier to use a password generator based on that set of rules than to manually create passwords.

Long strings of random characters are difficult for most people to memorize. Mnemonic hashes, which reversibly convert random strings into more memorable passwords, can substantially improve the ease of memorization. As the hash can be processed by a computer to recover the original 60-bit string, it has at least as much information content as the original string. Similar techniques are used in memory sport.

==Password type and strength==
Random password generators normally output a string of symbols of specified length. These can be individual characters from some character set, syllables designed to form pronounceable passwords, or words from some word list to form a passphrase. The program can be customized to ensure the resulting password complies with the local password policy, say by always producing a mix of letters, numbers and special characters. Such policies typically reduce strength slightly below the formula that follows, because symbols are no longer independently produced.

The Password strength of a random password against a particular attack (brute-force search), can be calculated by computing the information entropy of the random process that produced it. If each symbol in the password is produced independently and with uniform probability, the entropy in bits is given by the formula formula_1, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of possible symbols and &quot;L&quot; is the number of symbols in the password. The function log2 is the base-2 logarithm. &quot;H&quot; is typically measured in bits.

Any password generator is limited by the state space of the pseudo-random number generator used if it is based on one. Thus a password generated using a 32-bit generator is limited to 32 bits entropy, regardless of the number of characters the password contains.

==Websites==
A large number of password generator programs and websites are available on the Internet. Their quality varies and can be hard to assess if there is no clear description of the source of randomness that is used and if source code is not provided to allow claims to be checked. Furthermore, and probably most importantly, transmitting candidate passwords over the Internet raises obvious security concerns, particularly if the connection to the password generation site&#x27;s program is not properly secured or if the site is compromised in some way. Without a secure channel, it is not possible to prevent eavesdropping, especially over public networks such as the Internet. A possible solution to this issue is to generate the password using a client-side programming language such as JavaScript. The advantage of this approach is that the generated password stays in the client computer and is not transmitted to or from an external server.

=== Web Cryptography API ===
The Web Cryptography API is the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) recommendation for a low-level interface that would increase the security of web applications by allowing them to perform cryptographic functions without having to access raw keying material. The Web Crypto API provides a reliable way to generate passwords using the codice_1 method. Here is the simple Javascript code that generate the strong password using web crypto API.

== FIPS 181 standard ==
Many computer systems already have an application (typically named &quot;apg&quot;) to implement the password generator standard FIPS 181. FIPS 181—Automated Password Generator—describes a standard process for converting random bits (from a hardware random number generator) into somewhat pronounceable &quot;words&quot; suitable for a passphrase. However, in 1994 an attack on the FIPS 181 algorithm was discovered, such that an attacker can expect, on average, to break into 1% of accounts that have passwords based on the algorithm, after searching just 1.6 million passwords. This is due to the non-uniformity in the distribution of passwords generated, which can be addressed by using longer passwords or by modifying the algorithm.

==Mechanical methods==
Yet another method is to use physical devices such as dice to generate the randomness. One simple way to do this uses a 6 by 6 table of characters. The first die roll selects a row in the table and the second a column. So, for example, a roll of 2 followed by a roll of 4 would select the letter &quot;j&quot; from the fractionation table below. To generate upper/lower case characters or some symbols a coin flip can be used, heads capital, tails lower case. If a digit was selected in the dice rolls, a heads coin flip might select the symbol above it on a standard keyboard, such as the &#x27;$&#x27; above the &#x27;4&#x27; instead of &#x27;4&#x27;.

<doc id="1335096" wikidata="Q3168790" url="?curid=1335096" title="USS Henley (DD-39)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Henley&quot; (DD-39) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated as CG-12. She was named for Robert Henley.

&quot;Henley&quot; was launched on 3 April 1912 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, in Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Constance Henley Kane, great-grandniece or Robert Henley; and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 6 December 1912.

==Pre-World War I==
After training and shakedown, &quot;Henley&quot; joined the US Atlantic Torpedo Fleet at Newport, Rhode Island, for a peacetime career of tactical exercises and training maneuvers along the coast from the Caribbean to the North Atlantic. On 22 April 1914, she joined the fleet off Tampico, Mexico, to protect American citizens and property in the face of revolution in that country. During this period, &quot;Henley&quot; also saw duty transporting refugees and supplies. With war in Europe that fall, she began Neutrality Patrol along the coast and checked belligerent vessels in American ports.

==World War I==
When America entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Henley&quot; continued patrol along the coast and also escorted fuel ships to the destroyers guarding America&#x27;s first troop convoy on 13 June. For the remainder of the war, &quot;Henley&quot; performed convoy duty along the coast and carried out anti-submarine patrol off New York Harbor. &quot;Henley&quot; put in at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 22 December 1918 and decommissioned there on 12 December 1919.

==Inter-war period==
Transferred to the Coast Guard on 16 May 1924, she served in the Rum Patrol. She was originally stationed at Stapleton, New York and then transferred to New London, Connecticut.

She returned to the Navy on 8 May 1931 and was sold for scrap to Michael Flynn Inc of Brooklyn, New York on 22 August 1934.

<doc id="1335100" wikidata="Q7819948" url="?curid=1335100" title="Tommy Tuberville">
<text>Thomas Hawley Tuberville (; born September 18, 1954) is an American politician and retired college football coach who is the senior United States senator from Alabama, a seat he has held since 2021. Before entering politics, Tuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He was also the head football coach at the University of Mississippi from 1995 to 1998, Texas Tech University from 2010 to 2012, and the University of Cincinnati from 2013 to 2016.

Tuberville won five national coach-of-the-year awards (AP, AFCA, Sporting News, Walter Camp, and Bear Bryant) after Auburn&#x27;s 13–0 season in 2004, in which Auburn won the Southeastern Conference title and the Sugar Bowl, but was left out of the BCS National Championship Game. He earned his 100th career win in 2007. Tuberville is the only Auburn football coach to beat in-state rival Alabama six consecutive times. In 2015, he was the president of the American Football Coaches Association. He worked for ESPN as a color analyst for its college football coverage during 2017.

In his first political campaign, Tuberville won the Republican nomination for the 2020 Senate election in Alabama and defeated Democratic incumbent Doug Jones by over 20 points. Establishing himself as an ally of President Donald Trump, he was among a group of Republican senators who attempted to overturn Democratic president-elect Joe Biden&#x27;s victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Tuberville became Alabama&#x27;s senior senator in 2023 when Senator Richard Shelby retired.

For 10 months in 2023, Tuberville blocked all promotions of senior officers in the U.S. military. His protest of Defense Department policies on abortion temporarily deprived the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps of confirmed top officers and delayed the filling of more than 450 other senior positions.

== Early life and education ==
Tuberville was born and raised in Camden, Arkansas, one of three children of Olive Nell (née Chambliss) and Charles R. Tuberville Jr. He graduated from Harmony Grove High School in Camden in 1972. He attended Southern State College (now Southern Arkansas University), where he lettered in football as a safety for the Muleriders and played two years on the golf team. He received a B.S. in physical education from SSC in 1976. In 2008, he was inducted into the Southern Arkansas University Sports Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
Tuberville first coached at Hermitage High School in Hermitage, Arkansas. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas State University. He then went through the ranks at the University of Miami, beginning as graduate assistant and ending as defensive coordinator in 1993, winning the national championship three times during his tenure there (1986–1994). In 1994, Tuberville replaced Bob Davie as defensive coordinator under R. C. Slocum at Texas A&amp;M University. The Aggies went 10–0–1 that season.

===Ole Miss===
Tuberville got his first collegiate head coaching job in 1994 at the University of Mississippi (&quot;Ole Miss&quot;). Despite taking over a Rebels team under severe NCAA scholarship sanctions, he was named the SEC Coach of the Year in 1997 by the AP.

At Ole Miss, Tuberville became involved in the movement to ban Confederate flags from the football stadium by requesting that the students quit waving them during the home football games. He said, &quot;We can&#x27;t recruit against the Confederate flag.&quot; Ole Miss&#x27;s chancellor, Robert Khayat, ultimately placed a ban on sticks at football games, which effectively banned spectators from waving flags.

During his tenure, Tuberville was known as the &quot;Riverboat Gambler&quot; for his aggressive play-calling, especially on fourth down. His teams went 1–3 against Arkansas and 2–2 against in-state arch-rival Mississippi State in the annual Egg Bowl game. After the 1998 regular season ended, Tuberville said, &quot;They&#x27;ll have to carry me out of here in a pine box&quot;, in reference to not leaving to coach at another school. Less than a week later, it was announced that he was departing for Auburn.

===Auburn===

Tuberville left Ole Miss after the 1998 season to take the head coaching job at Auburn University in Alabama. At Auburn, he guided the Tigers to the top of the SEC standings, leading them to an SEC championship and the Western Division title in 2004. Under his direction, the Tigers made eight consecutive bowl appearances, including five New Year&#x27;s Day bowl berths.

During the 1999 off-season, wide receiver Clifton Robinson was charged with statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl. Tuberville suspended Robinson from the team from March to August, when Robinson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. Tuberville subsequently punished Robinson by suspending him for the season opener, then allowed him to rejoin the team.

In 2004, Auburn went 13–0, including the SEC title and a win over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl. Tuberville received the Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year Award, the American Football Coaches Association, the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.

In 2005, despite losing the entire starting backfield from the unbeaten 2004 team to the first round of the NFL draft, Tuberville led Auburn to a 9–3 record, finishing the regular season with victories over rivals Georgia and Alabama.

Under Tuberville, Auburn had a winning record against its biggest rival, Alabama (7–3), and was tied with its next two most significant rivals, Georgia (5–5) and LSU (5–5). He was also 5–5 against Arkansas. He led Auburn to six straight victories over in-state rival Alabama, the longest win streak in this rivalry since 1982, the year Auburn broke Alabama&#x27;s nine-year winning streak.

Tuberville established himself as one of the best big-game coaches in college football, winning 9 of his last 15 games against top-10 opponents since the start of the 2004 season. In 2006, his Tigers beat two top-5 teams that later played in BCS bowls, including eventual BCS Champion Florida. Tuberville had a 5–2 career record against top-5 teams, including three wins against Florida. But he developed a reputation for losing games when he clearly had the better team. Examples include a humbling 24-point loss to a 4–5 Alabama team in 2001 and a loss to Vanderbilt—the first time Auburn lost to the Commodores in over 50 years. After Auburn lost three straight SEC games in 2003, Auburn booster Bobby Lowder and Auburn president and athletic director contacted then Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino to gauge his interest in taking the Auburn job if Tuberville was fired. The press found out about the meeting, which occurred just before the 2003 Alabama game, and the episode has since been known as &quot;JetGate&quot;.

Tuberville coached 19 players who were selected in the NFL draft, including four first-round picks in 2004, with several others signing as free agents. He coached eight All-Americans and a Thorpe Award winner (Carlos Rogers). Thirty-four players under Tuberville were named to All-SEC (First Team). Eighteen were named All-SEC freshman. His players were named SEC player of the week 46 times. He also had two SEC players of the year and one SEC Championship game MVP.

Tuberville fired offensive coordinator Tony Franklin on October 8, 2008. After the 2008 season, with a 5–7 record including losses to Vanderbilt, West Virginia, and a final 36–0 loss to Alabama, Tuberville resigned. Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said, &quot;To say the least, I was a little shocked. But after three times of asking him would he change his mind, he convinced me that the best thing for him and his family and for this football program was for him to possibly take a year off and take a step back.&quot; With his departure, Tuberville was paid a prorated buyout of $5.1 million. The payments included $3 million within 30 days of his resignation date and the remainder within a year.

After his departure from Auburn, during the 2009 football season, Tuberville worked as an analyst for Buster Sports and ESPN, discussing the SEC and the Top 25 on various television shows and podcasts. He also made a cameo appearance in the Academy Award-winning feature film &quot;The Blind Side&quot;.

===Texas Tech===
On December 31, 2009, Tuberville expressed interest in becoming head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. The position was left open after the university fired Mike Leach. On January 9, 2010, Tuberville was named head coach, and he was introduced at a press conference the next day. On January 1, 2011, he became the second head coach in Texas Tech football history to win a bowl game in his first season—an accomplishment unmatched since DeWitt Weaver&#x27;s first season in 1951–52. This was a 45–38 victory over Northwestern in the inaugural TicketCity Bowl.

On January 18, 2011, Texas Tech announced that Tuberville received a one-year contract extension and a $500,000 per year raise. The extension and raise gave Tuberville a $2 million salary through the 2015 season. Tuberville was responsible for the highest-rated recruiting class in Texas Tech history, securing the 18th-ranked recruiting class in 2011, according to Rivals.com and the 14th-ranked class in the country according to Scout.com.

On November 10, 2012, during a game against Kansas, Tuberville yanked the hat and headset off his graduate assistant Kevin Oliver. Immediately after the game, Tuberville said he was aiming for Oliver&#x27;s shirt in an attempt to pull him off the field. Two days later, he apologized in his weekly press conference, saying he wanted to set a better example for his two sons, one of whom was on the team. Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby publicly reprimanded Tuberville, calling his act &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot;.

Although Tuberville continued to run Leach&#x27;s wide-open &quot;Air Raid&quot; spread offense, he was never really embraced by a fan base still smarting over Leach&#x27;s ouster. According to a student on a recruiting trip to Texas Tech, Tuberville departed a recruiting dinner mid-meal and the next day accepted an offer to become Cincinnati&#x27;s head coach. He left Texas Tech with an overall record of 20–17 and 9–17 in Big 12 conference play.

In 2025, Tuberville said he recruited Patrick Mahomes, who played at Texas Tech from 2014 to 2016, but Mahomes said that was not true.

===Cincinnati===
On December 8, 2012, Tuberville resigned as head coach at Texas Tech in order to become the 38th head coach at the University of Cincinnati. He signed a $2.2 million contract to coach the team. Cincinnati&#x27;s athletic director, Whit Babcock, had previously worked with Tuberville at Auburn; the two had been friends for several years. On December 9, a &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot; article pointed out that Cincinnati is only from Guilford, Indiana, home of Tuberville&#x27;s wife, Suzanne.

In 2013, his first season with Cincinnati, Tuberville led the Bearcats to an overall record of 9–4 and a 6–2 conference record. His 2014 team was also 9–4 overall, but this time earned an American Athletic Conference co-championship by virtue of their 7–1 league mark. Both years also saw bowl losses, in 2013 to North Carolina and 2014 to Virginia Tech.

On December 4, 2016, after a 4–8 season, Tuberville resigned as head coach of Cincinnati. He left Cincinnati with an overall record of 29–22 and 18–14 in AAC conference play.

== TS Capital ==
After resigning from Auburn in December 2008, Tuberville formed a 50-50 partnership with former Lehman Brothers broker John David Stroud, creating TS Capital Management and TS Capital Partners, where he had an office and helped find investors. In February 2012, seven investors sued Tuberville and Stroud, saying they were defrauded of more than $1.7 million that they invested from 2008 to 2011. Tuberville&#x27;s attorneys denied the allegations.

In May 2012, Stroud was indicted for fraudulent use of $5.2 million from various Auburn investment companies, including his partnerships with Tuberville; Tuberville was not charged. Tuberville said in court filings that he was also a victim, and had lost $450,000; he settled the investor lawsuit in October 2013 on undisclosed terms. In November 2013, Stroud pleaded guilty and received a 10-year sentence.

==Tommy Tuberville Foundation==
In 2014, Tuberville founded the Tommy Tuberville Foundation. Its website said its purpose was &quot;to recognize and support organizations and causes that connect with the beliefs and values of the Tuberville family: assisting our military and veterans; awareness, education and prevention of health issues, particularly among women and children; and, education and community initiatives.&quot;

Through its first five years, the foundation raised $289,599 but spent just $51,658 on charitable causes, tax records showed. This rate of 18% is less than the 65% that the Better Business Bureau says ethical charities should spend on their causes. In 2020, the Associated Press called the Tuberville Foundation &quot;a questionable charity that raises money but gives very little away&quot;. Foundation officials said the tax filings did not reflect volunteer labor and donated materials used to refurbish veterans&#x27; homes.

In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Tuberville campaign and foundation officials &quot;produced internal records for 2018 that showed nearly $20,000 was raised for a temporary project to provide a retreat for veterans. But the records raised bookkeeping questions, since they showed more than $61,000 of 2018 revenue, roughly twice what the charity reported to the I.R.S. that year&quot;.

In 2021, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported, the foundation &quot;reported it had $74,101 in revenue and spent just 12 percent of that, or $9,000, while $32,000 went to administrative costs (including nearly $12,400 to pay off a truck the charity purchased in 2018 for $27,369)&quot;. By the end of 2021, the foundation&#x27;s website had gone defunct.

In July 2023, a spokesperson for Tuberville said that the foundation had been under audit and had paused its activities, but that Tuberville was reforming it.

== U.S. Senate ==
===Elections===

==== 2020 ====
In August 2018, Tuberville moved from Florida to Alabama with the intention to run for the U.S. Senate in 2020. In April 2019, he announced he would enter the 2020 Republican primary for the Senate seat held by Democrat Doug Jones. Tuberville&#x27;s campaign was described as &quot;low-profile,&quot; with few pre-scheduled campaign appearances or press conferences. He closely allied himself with President Donald Trump. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was a member of Tuberville&#x27;s campaign staff.

Tuberville opposes the right to an abortion and favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He supports Trump&#x27;s proposal to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Tuberville supports reducing the national debt through cuts to social programs, but opposes cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. He dismisses the science of climate change, saying that the global climate &quot;won&#x27;t change enough in the next 400 years to affect anybody.&quot;

On March 3, 2020, Tuberville received 33.4% of the vote in the Republican primary, ahead of former United States senator and former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who received 31.6%. Because neither candidate won over 50% of the vote, a runoff election ensued.

On March 10, ahead of the runoff election, Trump endorsed Tuberville. Trump had been angered by Sessions&#x27;s decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections when Sessions was U.S. attorney general. In May 2020, Trump called Sessions &quot;slime&quot; for this decision. In campaign ads, Tuberville attacked Sessions for not being &quot;man enough to stand with President Trump when things got tough.&quot; In the July 14 runoff, Tuberville defeated Sessions with 60.7% of the vote.

As the Republican nominee, Tuberville was heavily favored to win the election. He was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee, America&#x27;s largest anti-abortion organization. On November 3, he defeated Jones with 60.1% of the vote.

In an &quot;Alabama Daily News&quot; interview after the election, Tuberville said that the European theater of World War II was fought &quot;to free Europe of socialism&quot; and erroneously that the three branches of the U.S. federal government were &quot;the House, the Senate, and the executive.&quot; He also said that he was looking forward to raising money from his Senate office, a violation of federal law. Tuberville&#x27;s comments attracted criticism.

On November 26, 2020, Tuberville announced that his chief of staff would be Stephen Boyd, who had been serving as assistant attorney general for the Office of Legislative Affairs at the U.S. Department of Justice.

==== 2026 ====
On November 12, 2024, Tuberville announced his candidacy for reelection for a second term in the 2026 elections.

=== Tenure ===

Tuberville was one of six Republican senators to vote against expanding the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S. Justice Department to review hate crimes related to COVID-19 and establish an online database. In February 2022, Tuberville dismissed &quot;ridiculous&quot; proposals to ban lawmakers from trading stocks. According to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, Tuberville violated the STOCK Act 132 times in 2021.

In May 2022, Tuberville introduced the Financial Freedom Act of 2022, which would allow for the inclusion of cryptocurrency in individual retirement accounts.

Speaking at a Trump rally in Nevada on October 8, 2022, Tuberville claimed that Democrats are &quot;pro-crime&quot;, &quot;want to take over what you&#x27;ve got&quot;, and &quot;want because they think the people that do the crime are owed that&quot;. These remarks were widely condemned as inaccurate and racist; for example, the NAACP called them &quot;flat out racist, ignorant and utterly sickening&quot;.

Tuberville was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, telling reporters, &quot;This bill does not go nearly far enough to reform our broken budget&quot;.

In June 2024, Tuberville called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy a &quot;dictator&quot; and said that Russian president Vladimir Putin &quot;doesn&#x27;t want Ukraine. He doesn&#x27;t want Europe. Hell, he&#x27;s got enough land of his own. He just wants to make sure he doesn’t have United States weapons in Ukraine pointing at Moscow.&quot;

==== Objections to the 2020 U.S. presidential election ====
After taking office in January 2021, Tuberville joined a group of Republican senators who announced they would formally object to counting electoral votes won by Democratic president-elect Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. The objections were part of a continued effort by Trump and his allies to overturn his defeat in the election.

When the Electoral College count was held on January 6, pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol, forcing officials to evacuate their chambers before the count was completed. Trump contacted Tuberville during the riot through the cell phone of Utah senator Mike Lee, whom Trump misdialed. The count resumed that evening once the Capitol was secured.

Tuberville voted in support of an objection to Arizona&#x27;s electoral votes and an objection to Pennsylvania&#x27;s electoral votes, which were both won by Biden. He was one of six Republican senators to support the former objection and one of seven to support the latter objection; the remainder of the Senate defeated the objections. No further objections to the electoral votes were debated and the count concluded on the morning of January 7, certifying Biden&#x27;s victory over Trump.

==== 2021 storming of the United States Capitol ====
On May 28, 2021, Tuberville voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

====&quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;====
When &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; came before the Supreme Court in 2022, Tuberville signed an amicus brief supporting the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and its federal protection of abortion. After &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overturned in June 2022, Tuberville called it a &quot;victory for life&quot;.

==== Same-sex marriage ====
In 2022, Tuberville responded to a question about the Respect for Marriage Act, which would federally codify same-sex marriage, by saying there was &quot;no need for legislating on gay marriage&quot;. He also said, &quot;I&#x27;m all about live life the way you want to. It&#x27;s a free country.&quot; He voted against the bill, which passed and was signed into law.

==== Transgender policy ====
Tuberville has backed several bills intended to restrict various activities by transgender people.

In February 2023, he co-sponsored a bill to prevent people with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria from serving in the U.S. military, with limited exceptions.

In March 2023, he reintroduced a bill to forbid public schools from allowing a trans girl or woman to participate in a girl&#x27;s or women&#x27;s sport. Co-sponsored by 19 Republicans, the act says gender would be &quot;recognized based solely on a person&#x27;s reproductive biology and genetics at birth&quot; rather than how a person identifies.

On March 25, 2023, Tuberville complained publicly about a video showing Lieutenant Junior Grade Audrey Knutson, who identifies as nonbinary, reading a poem during a spoken-word event aboard the aircraft carrier . The video had gone viral after the U.S. Navy posted it to its Instagram page. After Tuberville told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he had &quot;a lot of problems with the video&quot;, Admiral Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations, said he was &quot;particularly proud of this sailor&quot; and added that if someone is &quot;willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I&#x27;m proud to serve beside them.&quot;

On March 29, 2024, Tuberville accused the Democratic Party of being a &quot;Satanic cult&quot; in response to a tweet by the New York Post about the banning of religious-themed designs from the White House Easter Egg art contest. His comment came at a time of widespread backlash by right-wing to far-right politicians and pundits after Biden publicly acknowledged International Transgender Day of Visibility, which fell on the same date as Easter in 2024.

In January 2025, Tuberville said that transgender children should &quot;live in fear&quot; of their parents as he believed the parents were turning them trans, which Tuberville called &quot;child abuse&quot; and an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot;. LGBTQ Nation refuted these claims, saying that &quot;there is no evidence that a person who is not LGBTQ+ can be turned LGBTQ+ by their parents&quot;.

==== Hold on military nominations ====

In December 2022, after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced an upcoming policy to allow pregnant service members leave and reimbursement of travel costs so that they may obtain legal abortions in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Tuberville threatened to put a Senate hold on all military promotions in protest of the policy. The policy was instituted in February 2023, with Tuberville announcing a day later that he would hold all &quot;civilian, flag, and general officer nominations&quot; due to the &quot;illegal expansion of DoD authority and gross misuse of taxpayer dollars&quot; for abortions.

Over the next few months, Tuberville&#x27;s hold blocked the filling of hundreds of senior positions. &quot;Without these leaders in place, these holes severely limit the department&#x27;s ability to ensure the right person is in place at the right time, and to ensure a strategic readiness and operational success&quot;, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on June 20.

On July 11, Tuberville blocked the confirmation of a new Marine Corps commandant, leaving the Corps without a leader for the first time in two centuries. By August, more than 300 generals, admirals, and policy officials had not yet been confirmed. The hold also blocked the appointment of a new Army chief of staff, vacant as of August 3, and a new chief of naval operations, vacant as of August 14. Five military commands at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama were also affected.

On September 20, the Senate, working around Tuberville&#x27;s hold in a rarely used procedure, voted to confirm three of the highest-ranking officers: the Joint Chiefs chairman, Marine Corps commandant, and Army chief of staff. The move elevated Marine Corps general Eric Smith to commandant, but the hold prevented him from appointing a deputy commandant, a situation he called &quot;not sustainable&quot;. On October 29, Smith was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. Lacking a deputy commandant or other available four-star general, the Marine Corps tapped a lieutenant general to temporarily perform the duties of commandant.

On November 1, incensed senators brought dozens of military nominations to the floor; Tuberville blocked them all. The next day, the Senate confirmed a new chief of naval operations, a new Air Force chief of staff, and a new assistant commandant of the Marine Corps through a laborious process of circulating a cloture petition.

On December 5, 2023, Tuberville largely lifted his hold, which had blocked 451 promotions during the previous week; the Senate responded by promoting 425 military officers. But he retained his hold on 11 officers nominated for four-star positions. On December 19, he lifted the hold on the final 11 officers, ending the matter.

==== Gaza ====
In 2025, Tuberville praised Trump&#x27;s proposal to have the U.S. take over the Gaza Strip, calling it &quot;a good idea&quot;.

==== Comments on white nationalists ====
On May 10, 2023, Birmingham-area radio station WBHM broadcast an interview in which Tuberville was asked whether he believed white nationalists should be allowed to serve in the military. Tuberville said the Biden administration &quot;call[s] them that. I call them Americans.&quot; Later that day, his congressional staff released a statement that said Tuberville &quot;was being skeptical of the notion that there are white nationalists in the military, not that he believes they should be in the military.&quot; U.S. military leaders have said extremism in the ranks is growing. For example, an October 2020 Pentagon report said there were &quot;white supremacist inroads in the U.S. military&quot;. Much independent reporting indicates this as well.

After the interview, Tuberville&#x27;s brother Charles said he felt &quot;compelled to distance himself&quot; from Tuberville and his &quot;ignorant, hateful rants&quot; and &quot;vile rhetoric&quot;.

In July 2023, CNN&#x27;s Kaitlan Collins asked Tuberville about his earlier comments on white nationalists, whom she defined as &quot;someone who believes that the white race is superior to other races&quot;. Tuberville called that an &quot;opinion&quot;. He then denied white nationalists are inherently racist. Tuberville&#x27;s refusal to accept the definition of a white nationalist drew heavy criticism from Democrats and Republican senators. A day later, Tuberville reversed his statement, saying, &quot;White nationalists are racists.&quot;

====Threats against Tuberville====
In June 2023, a New Hampshire resident was arrested and charged with threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a member of Congress. The charging documents did not name Tuberville as the target, but did say the charge was connected to his 2023 hold on military promotions.

In October 2023, Michael Hayden, a retired Air Force general and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, responded to a social-media post asking whether Tuberville should be removed from his committee assignments by saying, &quot;How about the human race?&quot; After some interpreted this as a call for Tuberville&#x27;s assassination, Hayden said he was suggesting that the senator not be considered human. Tuberville reported the comment to the United States Capitol Police, saying that Hayden had called for his &quot;politically motivated assassination&quot;.

=== Committee assignments ===
On February 1, 2023, Tuberville announced his committee assignments for the 118th Congress.
* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
**Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade
**Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy (Ranking member)
**Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research
* Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support
**Subcommittee on Seapower
**Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
*Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
**Subcommittee on Children and Families (Ranking member)
**Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety
*Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs

== Personal life ==

Tuberville married Vicki Lynn Harris, also from Camden, Arkansas, and a graduate of Harmony Grove High School, on December 19, 1976. They later divorced. In 1991, Tuberville married Suzanne (née Fette) of Guilford, Indiana; they have two sons. His elder son, Tucker, played as a quarterback while he was coach at Texas Tech, before following him to Cincinnati. Tucker then walked-on at Auburn, where he was used as a scout team quarterback during his three seasons there, and made his sole appearance for the team in the fourth quarter of a 56–34 win over Idaho.

Tuberville has a brother, Charles.

Tuberville invested $1.9 million in GLC Enterprises, which the Securities and Exchange Commission called an $80 million Ponzi scheme. He lost about $150,000 when the business closed in 2011.

At Auburn, Tuberville participated in the Auburn Church of Christ.

Tuberville&#x27;s interests include &quot;NASCAR, golf, football, hunting and fishing, [and] America&#x27;s military&quot;. He enjoys country and western music.

In August 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that campaign finance and property records suggest Tuberville lives in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, instead of Auburn, as his office claims, and has for almost two decades. The United States Constitution requires senators to live in the state where they are elected, but does not provide a minimum length of residency; Alabama requires a candidate to reside in the state for just one day to run for office.

=== Swatting ===
On December 24, 2023, Tuberville was doxxed and swatted, along with other leading activists and politicians in the same time period.

<text>King James Version is the second studio album by American rock band Harvey Danger, released on September 12, 2000, through . It was the band&#x27;s only album recorded for a major label, and their last with drummer Evan Sult. Written and recorded over the span of 16 months with producer John Goodmanson, the album marked a substantial departure from the lo-fi sound of the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; (1997); it encompassed a variety of rock music styles and explored &quot;the conflict between faith and skepticism&quot;. Although the bulk of the album&#x27;s material was recorded in March and April 1999, work on the album continued periodically until February 2000 due to a dispute surrounding Harvey Danger&#x27;s contract, which delayed its release.

The album was preceded by the release of two singles: &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, which reached number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, and &quot;Authenticity&quot;. &quot;King James Version&quot; received favourable reviews from critics, who praised the band&#x27;s musical growth. Due to a lack of promotional support, sales were extremely poor; by December 2004, it had sold only 25,000 copies in the United States. As a result, Harvey Danger disbanded at the end of the album&#x27;s supporting tour in April 2001. Despite its commercial failure, &quot;King James Version&quot; gradually attained a cult following and critical acclaim in the years following its release, and was later named one of the best albums of the 2000s by &quot;PopMatters&quot;. Harvey Danger performed the album in its entirety for one show in 2008. 

== Background ==
In 1997, Harvey Danger released their debut studio album, &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot;, through the Arena Rock Recording Company. Although the album was not a commercial success, major labels engaged in a bidding war to sign Harvey Danger after the album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;, began receiving airplay from several college radio stations and Los Angeles-based KROQ. The band subsequently signed with London Recordings&#x27; Slash Records imprint in May 1998, shortly after they hired Arena Rock owner Greg Glover. &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; was reissued by Slash/London the following month to great commercial success, largely due to &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;; the album went on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, and in February 1999 was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Private Helicopter&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s second single in October 1998, but it did not make an impact on any singles charts. Shortly thereafter, Harvey Danger ceased touring and returned to Seattle in November 1998.

Upon returning to Seattle, Harvey Danger went on a short hiatus during the winter holiday season. The band briefly considered breaking up, but decided against it, and began writing new material for their next album in November 1998. The album was initially envisioned as a &quot;dour, mellow anti-pop&quot; record. The band&#x27;s new material was more experimental and less commercial-sounding than their prior output. The band intended to distance themselves from &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;, which they thought had marked them as a one-hit wonder and a &quot;major label fabrication&quot; because of its ironic lyrics, which frontman Sean Nelson believed listeners had taken at &quot;face value&quot;. Nelson further explained:

== Recording and production ==
Harvey Danger finished recording demos for &quot;King James Version&quot; in February 1999. Thereafter, in early March 1999, the band travelled to Woodstock, New York, to record with producer John Goodmanson at Bearsville Sound. At Bearsville, the band recorded the album&#x27;s basic tracks and some overdubs, before ultimately deciding to return to Seattle to record the rest of the album. &quot;[I]t felt like we were spending a lot of money just so we could say we recorded at Bearsville. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily making us play better. So we went back home to do the rest&quot;, Nelson stated. Recording continued into late April 1999 at John &amp; Stu&#x27;s Place in Seattle and at Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, where additional overdubs were recorded to give the album &quot;more breadth, [and] some more colors&quot;. On May 17, 1999, Harvey Danger mixed &quot;King James Version&quot; at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles.

Harvey Danger had hoped to release &quot;King James Version&quot; in August or September 1999, but owing to a series of corporate mergers and restructurings, the album was indefinitely delayed. Universal Music Group (UMG), which had merged with London Recordings&#x27; parent company PolyGram in December 1998, had sold London Recordings&#x27; US division to Warner Music Group. Then, in August 1999, Warner Music Group announced that it would be merging London with its Sire Records Group to create London-Sire Records. Shortly thereafter, a dispute arose between London-Sire and UMG over the rights to Harvey Danger&#x27;s contract, resulting in the band being moved into a &quot;corporate black hole&quot; at UMG. The contractual dispute prevented Harvey Danger from recording and touring, and the band was forced to turn down an offer to open for The Pretenders. London-Sire also owed Harvey Danger hundreds of thousands of dollars, and Goodmanson, who allowed Harvey Danger to record at John &amp; Stu&#x27;s on the belief that he would be quickly reimbursed, took a financial hit; he was later compensated in full by the band. Nelson later stated that he felt &quot;morose&quot; and &quot;suicidally depressed&quot; throughout 1999 as a result of the album&#x27;s delays. 

During the band&#x27;s corporate struggles, the members of Harvey Danger put the album on hold and worked on individual projects. When the band came back and revisited the album with a different perspective, they decided to continue working on &quot;King James Version&quot;. During what Nelson described as the album&#x27;s &quot;second gestation period&quot;, parts of &quot;King James Version&quot; were revised, and three new songs—&quot;Meetings With Remarkable Men (Show Me the Hero)&quot;, &quot;Humility on Parade&quot; and &quot;Loyalty Bldg.&quot;—were recorded for the album. Recording was completed in late February 2000, and in June 2000, the band re-mixed/mixed the majority of the album&#x27;s tracks at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, B.C. Nelson later remarked that Harvey Danger had &quot;finished&quot; &quot;King James Version&quot; three times during 1999 and 2000.

== Composition ==
=== Music ===
Musically, &quot;King James Version&quot; has been described as indie rock, alternative rock and pop rock. Reviews also noted that the album was influenced by power pop, rockabilly, glam rock and punk rock. In contrast to the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;King James Version&quot; features a less grungy and lo-fi sound, and uses a wider variety of instruments, including keyboards, piano and pump organ. Guitarist Jeff J. Lin, a classically trained musician, composed cello and viola arrangements for the album, which were played by members of the Seattle Symphony. Nelson&#x27;s vocal performances were compared to Chuck Berry, Robert Smith and Richard Hell.

Speaking with Yahoo!&#x27;s &quot;LAUNCH&quot;, Nelson labelled the album a middle ground between &quot;catchy rock&quot; and &quot;very quiet, pretty songs&quot;. &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as featuring a &quot;laid-back feel complete with 80&#x27;s retro guitar effects.&quot; &quot;(Theme from) Carjack Fever&quot; is a reworked version of &quot;Carjack Fever&quot;, an early Harvey Danger song first recorded in 1995, which later appeared in an unfinished state and played in reverse as a hidden track on &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot;. &quot;Pike St./Park Slope&quot; is a sombre piano ballad and was compared to the works of Ben Folds and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. &quot;Underground&quot; is a &quot;radically-rearranged&quot; cover of a song by the Seattle band This Busy Monster.

The overall atmosphere and direction of &quot;King James Version&quot; was, in part, informed by the English rock band Radiohead and their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer.&quot; After hearing about the album&#x27;s success, which Nelson described as the &quot;ultimate one-hit wonder redemption narrative&quot;, Harvey Danger decided to experiment with their sound and make a &quot;great leap forward, artistically, and do something really ambitious&quot; in order to maintain their credibility. The band was ultimately unable to emulate Radiohead&#x27;s creative and technical process, resulting in stripped-back arrangements. Nelson stated, &quot;It certainly was no &quot;OK Computer&quot;, though there are a couple of moments where we obviously are reaching for that kind of faux-epic sound. I’ve listened to &quot;King James Version&quot; a lot and I don’t know what the hell it sounds like.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===
The heavily philosophical and ambiguous lyrics on &quot;King James Version&quot;, written by Sean Nelson, primarily discuss &quot;the conflict between faith and skepticism&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrics are often humorous, cynical, sarcastic or deadpan, and they reference historical popular culture, literature and places. Various popular figures and musicians, such as Jesus, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathanael West, the Malboro Man and Morrissey are mentioned on the album&#x27;s tracks. The band has described the lyrics as using multiple literary devices, including first person and multiple perspectives and unreliable narrators; sometimes, the album employs dialogues. Nelson described the album as being &quot;very personal, but not autobiographical&quot;, and &quot;more in the way of character study than autobiographical revelation&quot;. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men (Show Me the Hero)&quot;, is about a man &quot;looking for somebody to be a disciple of. Jesus doesn&#x27;t work, Morrissey doesn&#x27;t work, and Kip Winger is the only one who provides a voice of reason&quot;. &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; directly alludes to &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; by The Byrds, and also references &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill&quot; by The Velvet Underground.

The referential nature of &quot;King James Version&quot;&#x27;s lyrics was inspired by the works of Frederic Tuten, an American novelist known for his style of referencing to the past via the present. Nelson stated, &quot;I feel that&#x27;s a huge part of listening to rock n&#x27; roll music. As a listener, when I want to talk about anything with my friends, I can casually say half a line from any of a hundred songs and they know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. I don&#x27;t have to elucidate the sentiment any further. It&#x27;s admitting rock songs can be a response to rock songs, and not necessarily be just so referential that they&#x27;re just about rock songs.&quot; Nelson thanks Tuten in the album&#x27;s liner notes, as well as novelist Philip Roth and &quot;Le Show&quot; by Harry Shearer. To further connect with the album&#x27;s recurring theme of referencing other musicians and people, &quot;King James Version&quot; features an array of backup vocalists, including Grant Lee Buffalo&#x27;s Grant-Lee Phillips and Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s Ben Gibbard, in order to &quot;reflect many, many voices&quot;. Nelson deliberately avoided writing about Harvey Danger&#x27;s struggles with success, believing the subject to be &quot;stupid and irrelevant to most people that listen to music&quot;.

=== Title and packaging ===
The title is both a reference to the King James Version of the Bible, and to the album&#x27;s &quot;second gestation period&quot;. Nelson described the album&#x27;s title as referring to &quot;coming through a convoluted process and arriving at a version of the album and the band that feels sort of definitive&quot;. The album&#x27;s artwork, done by Tae Won Yu, was described by Nelson as an expression of the &quot;band&#x27;s fractured mental and psychic state, or relationship to ourselves, our city, our project, and each other.&quot;

== Release and promotion ==
Following the album&#x27;s completion, several UMG labels rejected &quot;King James Version&quot;. In June 2000, Harvey Danger chose to re-sign with their &quot;new/old&quot; label, London-Sire Records. On July 6, 2000, Harvey Danger announced on their website that &quot;King James Version&quot; had been fully sequenced, mastered and approved by London-Sire, and unveiled the new album&#x27;s title and release date. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Harvey Danger expanded into a sextet with the introduction of guitarist Mike Squires and keyboard player John Roderick, in an effort to improve the quality of the band&#x27;s live performances.

&quot;King James Version&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on September 12, 2000. Alongside the album, a self-titled EP containing three B-sides from the &quot;King James Version&quot; sessions was sold with purchases of the album exclusively at Circuit City stores, limited to 3,000 copies. The EP&#x27;s songs were later included in the band&#x27;s 2009 compilation album &quot;Dead Sea Scrolls&quot;. Nelson attempted to get &quot;King James Version&quot; (including its B-sides) released on vinyl through Barsuk Records, of which he was a partner, but those plans fell through due to legal issues surrounding licensing. The album&#x27;s release was met with little fanfare, and failed to make an impact on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Speaking with &quot;The Morning Call&quot; three weeks after the album&#x27;s release, Nelson stated that he had anticipated, and received, &quot;a lot of indifference&quot; towards &quot;King James Version&quot; release, and felt that most of Harvey Danger&#x27;s audience was made up of &quot;the sort of people who buy whatever is on the radio, or they buy a record for a hit and they don’t listen to, or care about, what’s on the rest of the record&quot;. By December 2004, the album had sold 25,000 copies in the United States, well below the sales of the band&#x27;s debut album.

London-Sire promoted &quot;King James Version&quot; with the release of one single, &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, which was serviced to radio stations on August 7, 2000. The single became a minor hit for the band, reaching number 27 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and remaining on the chart for nine weeks. The band filmed a music video for the song, directed by Evan Bernard, in Los Angeles, California on August 15 and 16, 2000. The music video was added to rotation on MTV2; it was due to premiere on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; on September 24, 2000, but an MTV intern played the music video for &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; by accident instead. MTV responded to the band&#x27;s complaints by claiming that the video for &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; had received poor test screenings, and it was pulled from rotation. The band also appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; on October 18, 2000. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Authenticity&quot;, was released on August 28, 2001, through Gold Circle Records. At that point, the band had been proposing that the song be released as a single for nearly a year because it had been included in the soundtracks of &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; (2000) and &quot;Soul Survivors&quot; (2001), as well as the trailer of &quot;Soul Survivors&quot;. However, the single did not receive a music video or widespread promotion, as Harvey Danger had broken up by the time it was released.

Harvey Danger initially embarked on a national tour across the United States and Canada throughout the first half of September 2000 in support of &quot;King James Version&quot;. The band performed in Montreal and played an acoustic set at Tower Records in Seattle on September 12. From October 7 to October 27, 2000, Harvey Danger toured as an opening act for the pop-punk band SR-71 alongside the power pop band Wheatus. The remainder of the band&#x27;s shows in 2000 took place in the band&#x27;s hometown of Seattle during late December, where the band performed three songs for the Screaming Santa&#x27;s X-Mas Show at the I-Spy on December 23, and a New Year&#x27;s Eve show at Consolidated Works. From March 22 to 24, 2001, Harvey Danger performed as an opener for Alien Crime Syndicate. The band played their final show of that year on April 21, 2001, alongside Hazel and Quasi.

== Critical reception ==
The initial critical response to &quot;King James Version&quot; was generally favorable. AllMusic&#x27;s MacKenzie Wilson called Harvey Danger &quot;fresh and witty, [and] continuously satirical throughout&quot; the album. Par Winberg of &quot;Melodic&quot; described the album as &quot;unique&quot; and awarded it three-and-a-half stars. James Sullivan of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+ rating, describing it as &quot;mold-busting&quot; and &quot;a play for longevity&quot;. Bob Remstein of Wall of Sound scored the album 74 out of a possible 100, praising its catchiness and clever humour. David Wild of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;barbed&quot;, but also said that it was &quot;a step forward in both ambition and accomplishment&quot;, awarding it three stars out of five. Writing about the album in passing, Eric Weisbard of &quot;SPIN&quot; described &quot;King James Version&quot; as &quot;[kicking] their debut album&#x27;s ass&quot; and praised Nelson&#x27;s increased confidence as a frontman and the band&#x27;s improved cohesiveness.

Critical assessments on the lyrical content of &quot;King James Version&quot; were more mixed. Remstein felt that Nelson&#x27;s lyrics were overdone at points, and Sullivan took issue with the &quot;caustic&quot; nature of the lyrics; Weisbard also questioned whether the album&#x27;s &quot;witty swagger and rejection of novelty grade goofiness&quot; would be misunderstood by listeners. However, both Remstein and Sullivan agreed that the album&#x27;s smart humour prevailed over their issues with the lyrics. Similarly, Alex Pappademas of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; praised Nelson for his improved songwriting, and for out how to make assets out of the traits that used to make him annoying&quot;.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
The members of Harvey Danger were upset by the failure of &quot;King James Version&quot;, which they attributed to London-Sire&#x27;s ineffectual marketing and distribution of the album, and felt that the album had not truly been &quot;released&quot;. Nelson has said: &quot;Technically it was released, but it was released so poorly and haphazardly promoted that we just felt we had been robbed of an experience that was important to us.&quot; Harvey Danger disbanded at the end of their tour in April 2001 as a result of the album&#x27;s failure. Nelson said, &quot;We inevitably started hating each other, because who else was there to hate? We broke up because we had nothing else to say to each other at that point.&quot;

After disbanding, the band&#x27;s members pursued a number of musical and non-musical endeavours, with Nelson becoming a movie critic for the Seattle bi-weekly newspaper &quot;The Stranger&quot; and a business partner at Barsuk Records. In 2002, he formed a new band with Roderick, The Long Winters, before leaving the band to start work on a solo album. Nelson reached out to Jeff Lin and bassist Aaron Huffman to help out with the album, which ultimately resulted in Harvey Danger&#x27;s reformation in April 2004. Drummer Evan Sult, who had moved from Seattle to Chicago during the band&#x27;s hiatus and was then a member of the indie rock band Bound Stems, declined to join the band&#x27;s reunion; he was subsequently replaced by Michael Welke, who remained with the band until their second breakup in 2009. The negative experiences regarding the release and promotion of &quot;King James Version&quot; influenced Harvey Danger&#x27;s decision to release their follow-up album, &quot;Little by Little...&quot; (2005), as a free download on the band&#x27;s website, which Nelson said gave the band &quot;that sense of satisfaction or closure that comes from making a record and releasing it to the public. They either embrace it or don&#x27;t, but at least they&#x27;ll have the option of noticing it this time&quot;.

In the absence of commercial success, &quot;King James Version&quot; attained a cult following; while working on their own separate musical projects, people would approach Sult and Nelson to tell them of their admiration of the album. &quot;King James Version&quot; critical standing continued to rise, and has been credited with cementing a legacy for the band. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; Michael Edwards and &quot;Cokemachineglow&quot; Christopher Alexander both compared the album with Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996), another sophomore effort which performed poorly upon release but later attracted acclaim. In 2009, David Buchanan of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; called &quot;King James Version&quot; the &quot;most underappreciated album of 2000&quot;. In 2008, Myles Griffin of the &quot;Spartanburg&quot; &quot;Herald-Journal&quot; praised the album as &quot;one of the most creative and enjoyable rock albums of the decade&quot;. Evan Sawdey of &quot;PopMatters&quot; lauded &quot;King James Version&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest rock albums of the decade&quot; in 2013; the site would later place the album at number 73 on their list of &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the 2000s&quot; in 2020. &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; also included the album on their list of the &quot;Six Best Sophomore Albums By One Hit Wonders&quot; in 2012.

Harvey Danger performed &quot;King James Version&quot; in its entirety on March 7, 2008, at The Triple Door in Seattle as part of a set of concerts commemorating the 10th anniversary of &quot;Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone?&quot;. Ten of the album&#x27;s twelve songs (excluding &quot;You Miss the Point Completely I Get the Point Exactly&quot; and &quot;(This Is) The Thrilling Conversation You&#x27;ve Been Waiting For&quot;) were played at the band&#x27;s final show at The Crocodile Café in Seattle on August 29, 2009.

<doc id="1335110" wikidata="Q1543944" url="?curid=1335110" title="MG ZS (2001)">
<text>The MG ZS is a sports family car that was built by MG Rover from 2001 until 2005. The ZS is essentially a tuned version of the Rover 45 (which was launched in 1999). The 45 in turn is a facelifted version of the Rover 400 which was launched in hatchback form in 1995 and saloon form in 1996, which in turn was derived from the Honda Domani.

==Development==
The model was rapidly created from the Rover 45 after BMW sold off Rover in April 2000. Development of the model was greatly accelerated by the fact that Rover had already created 400 Series prototypes of the car using V6 engines and sporting suspension setups. In fact, MG Rover developed MG versions of all three Rover cars on sale at the time.

The Rover 45 donor car did not have a reputation for being a driver&#x27;s car, but in fact it was the most suitable car in the Rover range for making into the MG ZS, its Honda heritage providing double wishbone front suspension and fully independent multi link rear suspension.

As a Rover, the 45 was optimised for comfort rather than handling – however, as an MG the opposite was the case. The ZS 180, offering from the 2.5 L V6 engine and acceleration to 60 mph in 7.3 seconds, received favourable reviews in the press, with particular praise for its steering, handling and suspension. 

Setting the ZS apart from most rivals was the V6 configuration, when most of its rivals were using turbocharged engines.

== Variants and updates ==

The non-appearance of RD/X60 meant that in the first few months the MGZS was facelifted with the help of the car designer Peter Stevens (together with the rest of the MG Rover range) which introduced a new clear one-piece headlight, new bumpers and a flush tailgate/boot lid with the number plate relocated to the rear bumper together with new wheel designs, colours and a revised interior with climate control using parts from Zonda and Lamborghini, and with all ZS models an optional body kit which was derived from the MG XPower SV was fitted as standard on the ranging topping ZS180. 

The retro design cues adopted when the 400 became the 45 were dropped, for the first time the Rover 45 and MG ZS became noticeably different looking cars.

The MG ZS ceased production in April 2005, on the collapse of MG Rover Group (See John Towers: Rover), and the rights to make the car were soon repossessed by Honda, who owned the rights to the original design from 1995.

The Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile acquired the Longbridge plant and the MG marque for £53 million ($97 million), Nanjing Automobile formally established NAC MG UK Limited as a holding company for the plant and marque on 12 April 2006.

In 2009 the MG ZS was shown at the Shanghai Auto show badged as an MG5, after MG Rover had ceased, but that never made it to production.

== Performance ==
Performance data for the MG ZS range:
==ZS 180==
The MG ZS 180 was the flagship car of the ZS range. It was available as a five-door hatch or a four-door saloon. The 180 included a number of changes over the standard ZS, as well as incorporating all of the features of the ZS+ models, the ZS 180 was equipped with a lightweight all alloy 2.5-litre Rover KV6 Engine, with quad cams and twenty four valves.

The 180 features uprated front and rear brakes, with front discs (up from ) and rear discs (up from ) as well as ABS and EBD, lowered sports suspension with uprated springs and dampers, uprated bushes fitted to front upper and rear trailing arms, 17-inch sports alloy wheels with 205/45 R17 tyres.

Externally, the 180 can be identified with deep front bumper, with front bib spoiler and fog lamps and sculptured side sills. A large rear spoiler could be substituted for a standard size as a no cost option. The 180 was facelifted in 2004, along with the rest of the range, and gained a bodykit inspired by the MG Xpower SV. 

The kit incorporated wheel arch extensions with front wing vents, bumper spats and side skirts. The large &#x27;Extreme&#x27; rear spoiler became optional, with a subtle lip boot spoiler fitted as standard. Complementing the new bodykit were the new 17-inch &#x27;eleven spokes&#x27; alloy wheels. Both the wheels and bodykit were available as cost options on the rest of the range.

The MG ZS 180&#x27;s 2.5-litre (2497 cc) V6 engine produces at 6,500 rpm and at 4,000 rpm, giving a 0 to 60 mph time of 7.3 seconds, and a top speed of , with a combined fuel economy reading of 29 mpg.

== Racing ==
The MGZS was raced in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) from 2001 to 2008. The West Surrey Racing (WSR) team enjoyed &#x27;works&#x27; status for several years and initially ran cars with a two-litre version of the Rover KV6 engine, later switching to four cylinder JUDD engine which was heavy modified K-Series which had a capacity of 2.0 Litres (the largest production K series engine was 1.8 Litres).

Ex WSR V6 cars have appeared in other hands, and a &#x27;junior team&#x27; was run in during 2002. 

MG BTCC drivers to date have been:
==What the press said==
&quot;Drive a ZS180 back to back with a Golf V5, probably the sportiest of the line, and the Rover (based car) stomps all over the Volkswagen, its steering, chassis and engine beating the German into submission over the sort of lumpen road surfaces that make up the British B road&quot;

&quot;Of all the cars transformed by Rover&#x27;s engineers, this motor is perhaps the most remarkable, as it turned the originally rather dowdy 45 into a fire breathing super saloon&quot;

&quot;When young lads start lusting after what&#x27;s basically a rebodied and reengineered Rover 45, it&#x27;s obviously something special. It is no exaggeration to claim that the MG ZS 180 was the biggest surprise of the lot when the new range was launched in summer 2001.&quot;

&quot;At first glance it might appear to be a simple case of badge engineering, but the transformation from ageing Rover 45 to exciting MG ZS is a lot more than simply swapping metal monikers. Beneath the wire-meshed MG nose and bespoilered tail lies a lot of skilful engineering by Longbridge’s finest.&quot;

<doc id="1335115" wikidata="Q5130637" url="?curid=1335115" title="Clear (Spirit album)">
<text>Clear is the third studio album by American rock band Spirit. It was released in August 1969 by Ode Records.

The album was written largely in the wake of Spirit&#x27;s work on the soundtrack to the 1968 film &quot;Model Shop&quot;. Several of the band members have said that they felt there wasn&#x27;t enough time for developing the album after releasing two albums in 1968, recording a soundtrack and constantly touring. The album contains &quot;So Little Time To Fly&quot;, &quot;Dark Eyed Woman&quot; and &quot;New Dope In Town&quot;, as well as three instrumentals.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1969, Robert Christgau called Spirit &quot;a talented group with guts of cellophane&quot; and lead vocalist/guitarist Randy California &quot;the rock equivalent of the cool, progressive jazzman of the &#x27;50s&quot;. He commended the album for focusing the better songs on side one of the LP, saying its &quot;mostly excellent rock&quot; shows Spirit &quot;can be very good&quot;, but found songs like &quot;Ice&quot; on side two indicative of how &quot;incredibly empty&quot; the band can be as well.

==1996 re-release==
The original Ode Records recording of &quot;Clear&quot; would be later restored by Sony in 1996. The second edition includes both sides of the &quot;1984&quot; single, the song &quot;Fuller Brush Man&quot; (which hasn&#x27;t appeared elsewhere), and a piece entitled &quot;Coral&quot;, which is also available on the &quot;Model Shop&quot; soundtrack but is present here in an elaborately produced version. &quot;Coral&quot; is a dedication to groupie Coral Shields, the 11-year-old sister of Sable Starr whom Randy California was dating at the time.

According to American comics artist and publisher Stephen R. Bissette, the title poem &quot;The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy&quot; was originally conceived as a project for Bissette&#x27;s comics anthology &quot;Taboo&quot; and was actually written by horror novelist Michael McDowell, who had previously worked with Burton on the screenplays for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. McDowell is thanked in the acknowledgements at the end of the book, but is not credited for writing the poem.

<text>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs (, UD) is a ministry in the Government of Sweden responsible for policies related to foreign policy, democracy, human rights, international development cooperation and foreign trade.

The ministry is currently headed by the minister for foreign affairs, Maria Malmer Stenergard of the Moderate Party.

== History ==
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was added in 1791, when Gustav III established the King&#x27;s Cabinet for Foreign Correspondence. The organization that was formally named the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1840 was then created in practice.

It is possible to speak of a foreign administration to the function as soon as we can discern a Swedish central state administration, and from the end of the 13th century. Under Gustav Vasa, the chancellery developed into the body that handled and expedited government matters. With Gustav II Adolf&#x27;s reforms in the 1620s, a specialization was carried out within the chancellery so that foreign affairs were distributed among secretaries according to country.

The head of the chancellery was the chancellor. In a way, he can be described as foreign minister. More famous holders of this position are Axel Oxenstierna and Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. The title was changed during Charles XI&#x27;s time to Chancellery President.

During the period of freedom, the chancellery was divided into various expeditions, including a foreign expedition. These can be seen as predecessors to the ministries. The head of each expedition was a state secretary. The Chancellery President was the head of the Chancellery. During the period of freedom, his power was further strengthened. One of the famous holders of the post was Arvid Horn.

<doc id="1335166" wikidata="Q5474098" url="?curid=1335166" title="Foudry Brook">
<text>Foudry Brook is a small stream in southern England. It rises from a number of springs near the Hampshire village of Baughurst, and flows to the east and then the north, to join the River Kennet to the south of Reading. The upper section is called Silchester Brook, and beyond that, Bishop&#x27;s Wood Stream. The underlying geology is chalk, covered by a layer of clay, and so it has the characteristics of a clay stream, experiencing rapid increases in level after heavy rain due to run-off from the surrounding land. It passes a number of listed buildings and scheduled monuments, including the site of the Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum or Silchester.

The natural flow of the river is supplemented by treated effluent from two major sewage treatment works, which contribute to the poor quality of the water. Water quality is also affected by physical modification of the channel, which restricts the free movement of fish around the system. 

==Route==
Foudry Brook rises at springs between the small villages of Heath End and Baughurst, where it is known as Bishop&#x27;s Wood Stream. It flows eastwards though Tadley, and is briefly culverted under housing on Elmhurst before emerging back on the surface and passing under the A340 Mulfords Hill road. It then enters a much longer culvert under Tadley Bottom, and emerges into open countryside on the east side of Bowmonts Bridge. It crosses the Pamber Forest nature reserve, becoming the Silchester Brook, and turns to the south, where Silchester Sewage Treatment Works is on the right bank. It then passes between two earthworks before Honeymill Brook joins it on the right bank. The linear earthworks were associated with a Late Iron Age town that developed into the Roman town called Calleva or Silchester. They are and long, with a gap of where the river passes through.

Honeymill Brook rises at a pond near Browninghill Green, to the south of Baughurst, and at a series of springs to the east of the village near Church Brook Farm. The two sources join near Church Road, Tadley and flow eastwards to Honey Mill Bridge, which carries the A340 Aldermaston Road over the brook. The course of the Port Way Roman road also crosses at this point on the western boundary of Pamber Forest. On the far side of the woodland, it runs parallel to the earthworks and joins Silchester Brook as it turns to the east again. At Park Copse, higher ground prevents further progress to the east, and as turns to the north, it passes a moated site consists of a raised square platform, some square, surrounded by a stream-fed moat and some fishponds. The outflow from the moat joins Silchester Brook at Clapper&#x27;s Farm. The Reading to Basingstoke railway follows the valley northwards, running alongside the river.

A little further to the north, the course of the Devil&#x27;s Highway crosses the river, a Roman road that ran from London to Silchester. It turns to the north-east, and is joined by the West End Brook on its left bank, as it crosses into Berkshire. West End Brook rises close to the source of the Silchester Brook, but a little further to the north, and runs eastwards to reach the confluence. At the county boundary, it becomes the Foudry Brook, and at Stratfield Mortimer it passes close to the grade II listed St Mary&#x27;s Church building, designed in 1869 by Richard Armstrong, but containing stained glass from the 15th and 17th centuries, as well as a Saxon stone coffin lid for Aegelwardus, who died in 1017. On the right bank opposite the church building is a long linear fishpond. The river drops over a waterfall, which was originally part of a hydraulic ram, and provided water from the river to Manor House. This was also the location of a medieval watermill, and the straight course of the river below the waterfall may be due to the fact that it was built to return water from the mill to the river. A mill was recorded in the manor of Stratfield Mortimer when the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, and there is documentary evidence for a mill in 1304 and again in 1449–50, but nothing subsequently. Tun Bridge carries Station Road to the nearby grade II* listed Mortimer railway station, built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1848, and notable because it is one of a small number of his wayside station buildings that have remained virtually unaltered since their construction.

After passing Stratfield Mortimer Sewage Treatment Works on its left bank, the river turns to the east near Wokefield Park Training Centre, passing under the railway line, which continues northwards. Missels Bridge carries Cross Lane over the river before it passes another Clappers Farm, this one with a farmhouse dating from the 16th century with 19th century alterations. Reid&#x27;s Bridge carries the drive for Brook Farm, after which a ridge of higher ground separates the valley from that of the River Loddon, and so the river turns to the north. The hamlet of Lambwoodhill Common is on the left bank, with Foudry Bridge to the south and Gravelly Bridge to the north. Just before it reaches the M4 motorway Burghfield Brook joins on its left bank, and after the bridge, the stream passes between the Green Park Business Park and the Madejski Stadium and football centre west of Whitley, where it provides the water for the meadow-landscaped lakes. It then passes under a large roundabout on the A33 road, carries on between Thames Water&#x27;s Reading sewage treatment works to the west and the Brunel Retail Park to the east, before discharging into the River Kennet, here canalised as part of the Kennet and Avon Canal, just downstream of Fobney Lock and Bridge 8A, which carries the A33 over the Kennet. The Kennet weaves its way through Reading passing through County Lock and Blake&#x27;s Lock to join the River Thames downstream of Caversham Lock.

==Geology and hydrogeology==
Chalk is the major aquifer in the catchment area of the River Kennet and its tributaries, including the Foudry Brook. Whereas the chalk is on the surface in the west of the catchment, it is covered by a layer of clay and sand to the east, where the Foudry Brook is located. This gives it the typical characteristics of a clay catchment river, where the flow rates can be quite variable, with the low base flow rising rapidly after heavy rainfall, as surface water cannot pass through the impermeable clay, and quickly finds its way into the river.

==Ecology==
In 2004, Foudry Brook had a grade of ‘c’ to ‘d’ on the Environment Agency General Quality Assessment (GQA) scheme for biological and chemical quality (with ‘a’ being the highest quality and grade ‘f’ the lowest). This was thought to be a result of the discharge of treated effluent into the lower reaches from sewage treatment works.

The GQA scheme has since been replaced as a way of recording the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor or bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Foudry Brook system was as follows in 2019.
Water quality on Silchester Brook has improved from poor in 2015 to moderate in 2016. Most of the reasons for it not achieving good quality are connected with sewage discharge. West End Brook dropped from moderate to bad in 2015, and the reasons for it not being good are mainly to do with physical modification of the channel, which prevents fish freely moving around the system, and the presence of the invasive species, the North American signal crayfish. Burghfield Brook is affected by discharges from industry, and the main factors affecting the Foudry Brook are physical modification of the channel and sewage discharge.

The brook is prone to flooding along its length, which has caused the most problems on the outskirts of Whitley, where its water voles hinder raising banks and expansion of water-meadows.

==Pollution==
In an action brought by the Environment Agency in 2002, Total Fina Elf UK Ltd was fined £54,000 for causing petrol to enter groundwater and a tributary of the Foudry Brook, from its service station in Tadley. Between January 1999 and March 2001 from 2,000 up to 10,000 litres seeped into the ground from leaks in an underground petrol tank, and from filler and suction lines.

In July 2010 a serious leak from sewage works into the Brook near Silchester killed hundreds of fish and many other organisms on a three-mile stretch.

<text>Brent Danem Mayne (born April 19, 1968) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1990 to 2004 for the Kansas City Royals, New York Mets, Oakland Athletics, San Francisco Giants, Colorado Rockies, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Los Angeles Dodgers.

==Career==
Mayne attended Costa Mesa High School, in Costa Mesa, California, Orange Coast College and Cal State Fullerton. He was an All-American with the Cal State Fullerton Titans.

The Kansas City Royals selected Mayne in the first round, with the 13th overall selection, of the 1989 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. As a Royal, Mayne caught Bret Saberhagen&#x27;s no-hitter on August 26, 1991.

On August 22, 2000, the Colorado Rockies sent Mayne in as a relief pitcher in the 12th inning against the Atlanta Braves. Mayne, the Rockies&#x27; regular catcher, was unable to swing a bat due to a sprained left wrist and had missed the previous four games. Out of pitchers, manager Buddy Bell asked Mayne if he could pitch. Mayne, who later said he had never pitched at any level, responded, &quot;Yeah, I can pitch.&quot; He pitched one inning, surrendering no runs with a fastball that topped out at 83 miles per hour. Colorado won the game in the bottom of the 12th inning when rookie Adam Melhuse, pinch-hitting for Mayne, singled with the bases loaded and two outs. Mayne thus became the first position player pitcher to be credited with a win since Rocky Colavito in , and the last to do so until Wilson Valdez in 2011.

In a 15-year career, Mayne was a .263 hitter with 38 home runs and 403 RBI in 1279 games.

Mayne was inducted into the Orange Coast College Hall of Fame in 2006 and into the Cal State Fullerton Hall of Fame in 2011.

<doc id="1335181" wikidata="Q5156360" url="?curid=1335181" title="Competitive swimwear">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Competitive swimwear refers to the swimsuit, clothing, equipment, and accessories used in the aquatic sports of swimming, diving, artistic swimming, triathlon, and water polo.

Some swimsuits are designed specifically for swimming competitions where they may be constructed of a special low resistance fabric that reduces skin drag. Most competitive swimmers wear special swimsuits including partial bodysuits, racerback styles, jammers and racing briefs to assist their glide through the water thus gaining a speed advantage.

For diving in water temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F), special bodysuits called &quot;dive skins&quot; are worn. These suits are made from spandex and provide little thermal protection, but they protect the skin from jellyfish stings, sunburn, and abrasion. This kind of suit is also known as a &#x27;Stinger Suit&#x27;. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.

Unlike regular swimsuits, which are designed mainly for aesthetic appearances, swimsuits intended to be worn during competitions are manufactured to assist the athlete in swimming competitions. They reduce friction and drag in the water, increasing the swimmer&#x27;s forward motion efficiency. The tight fits allow for easy movement and are said to reduce muscle vibration, thus reducing drag. This also reduces the possibility that a high-forward dive will remove a diver&#x27;s swimwear. Starting around 2000, to improve the effectiveness of the swimsuits, engineers have taken to designing them to replicate the skin of sea-based animals, sharks in particular.

In July 2009, FINA voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance-enhancing swimsuits, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men&#x27;s swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women&#x27;s counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.

Some swimmers use a specialized training suit called drag suits to artificially increase drag during practice. Drag suits are swimwear with an outer layer of looser fabric – often mesh or nylon – to increase resistance against the water and build up the swimmer&#x27;s endurance. They come in a variety of styles, but most resemble a looser fitting square-cut or swim brief.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==History==
The history of competitive swimwear has been dominated by concerns over public nudity in the first half of the 20th century and by efforts to reduce water drag in the second half. Those efforts initially lead male swimmers to reduce the early sagging one-piece swimsuits down to briefs only. Goggles were used in the crossing of the English Channel back in 1911, but only in 1970 appeared at international competitions. With the advent of rubber technology, latex swimming caps became mass-produced in the 1920s, and more efficient silicone caps appeared in the 1970s. 

With the development of new materials that tightly fit the body and offered lower resistance to water than human skin, this trend was reversed to a complete body coverage from heels to neck and wrists. In 1999, Australian competitive swimmer Ian Thorpe signed with Adidas for an undisclosed six-figure sum, to race in their new bodysuit, although the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo. Thorpe&#x27;s success in the 2000 Summer Olympics wearing the Adidas full-length black polyurethane bodysuit, in contrast to other swimmers wearing textile swimwear (males wore legskins, jammers, or briefs, while females wore racerback maillots), led to other swimming manufacturers such as Speedo and Mizuno to create their own rival bodysuits. Thorpe subsequently worked with Adidas which in 2003 released the Adidas Jetconcept bodysuit, whose design &quot;came from the V-shaped grooves currently used on the wings and fuselage of civil aircraft&quot;.

The LZR Pro and LZR Elite lines were launched on 13 February 2008, with the LZR Elite being marketed as &quot;the world&#x27;s fastest swimsuit.&quot; It was the focus of Speedo&#x27;s campaign for the 2008 Summer Olympics, spearheaded by Michael Phelps of the United States. They created a holographic (visually generated) video of Phelps wearing the suit which was displayed in London, Sydney, New York, and Tokyo on the day of the suit&#x27;s release. Speedo&#x27;s LZR Racer had become so effective by the eve of the 2008 Summer Olympics that many swimmers, despite them or their swimming federations having exclusive contracts with other apparel makers, have chosen the LZR Racer over competing bodysuits. At that year&#x27;s Olympics in Beijing, 94% of all swimming races were won in that suit, While 98% of all medals were won by swimmers wearing that suit, and 23 out of the 25 world records broken were achieved by swimmers competing in the LZR suit. , 93 world records had been broken by swimmers wearing a LZR Racer, and 33 of the first 36 Olympic medals have been won wearing it.

In 2009, FINA rules and regulations were altered, effective from 1 January 2010. Suits made with polyurethane were banned because they made athletes more buoyant. These rules also banned suits that go above the navel or below the knee for men and suits that extend past the shoulders or cover the neck for women FINA stated that it &quot;wishes to recall the main and core principle is that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete&quot;.

==Suits==

===Bodyskin===

A bodyskin is a style of competitive swimwear worn by both female and male athletes. Bodyskins are normally made of technologically advanced lycra-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased drag resistance in the water.

The bodyskin resembles the design of a dive skin, commonly used by snorkelers and scuba divers for warm weather climates. The primary distinguishing feature is the material from which the bodyskin suit is made.

Some bodysuits provide full body coverage from the ankles to the neck and wrists, such as Ian Thorpe&#x27;s Adidas Jetconcept bodysuit which made its debut in 2003, Thorpe previously wore an earlier Adidas black bodysuit design in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Sleeveless designs such as the Speedo LZR Racer was popular in the 2008 Summer Olympics; Speedo also produces a body skin designed specifically for the backstroke. Other competing bodysuits include Acquablade, Fastskin, and Sharkskin, which are produced by Mizuno, Asics, Descente, Arena, and Nike.

Swimmers reported that body skins improved buoyancy. This is true as long as the suits remain dry. As such, they are recommended for distances under 200m.

The national coach of a small country stated that the suits need exact sizing and resulting high cost &quot;increas[ed] the disparity between the haves and have nots.&quot; As with most technologically advanced fabric swimwear, body skins were only commonly used at highly competitive levels of the swimming sport and are known to sell for prices over US$400. Despite their cost, a single bodysuit can only be used for a handful of races, as getting in and out of the suit repeatedly would damage its form-fitting properties, memorably when Ian Thorpe tore his Adidas bodysuit right before the 4×100 men&#x27;s freestyle relay podium ceremony in the 2000 Summer Olympics.

===FINA rule changes===
Bodyskins were banned from FINA competitions from the start of 2010 after many national swimming federations demanded the action, and leading athletes such as Michael Phelps and Rebecca Adlington criticised the suits. They continue to be used for other purposes, including research.

=== Briefs ===
A swim brief refers to any briefs style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming, water polo and diving. The popularity of the Australian Speedo (est. 1928) brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in some countries (e.g. the United States) to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker. Occasionally, the Speedo genericized trademark also applies to square cut swimsuits, but in general, the generic term is used for swim briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, bathers, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia as &quot;budgie smugglers&quot;.

Like underwear briefs, swim briefs feature a V-shape front and a solid back providing form-fitting coverage. They typically are worn below the lower waist. They are generally secured by thin banding at the upper thighs and either a drawstring around the waist or an elastic waistband. Swim briefs are most often made of a nylon and spandex (Lycra) composite, while some longer-lasting suits are made from polyester and still others from other materials. Most swim briefs have a beige or white front lining made of a similar fabric.

=== Drag suit ===

A drag suit is a pair of baggy square-cut or brief-style trunks that competitive swimmers may wear over their normal suit to provide extra resistance (&quot;drag&quot;) from the water. This allows the swimmer to get more out of their training than they would without a drag suit. Drag suits are meant to be worn over a long period of time to wear in the material and possibly tear the fabric. The more worn-in, torn or ripped the drag suit, the more resistance it provides the swimmer. Since drag suits make swimming more difficult, swimmers do not wear drag suits in competition. Drag suits originated as older swimsuits at the end of their useful life that swimmers would then wear over another suit.

=== Kneeskin ===
A kneeskin is a type of competitive swimwear worn by both male and female athletes. Kneeskins are normally made of technologically advanced lycra-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased drag resistance in the water.

The kneeskin is similar in design to the full bodyskin, but the kneeskin does not have leggings covering or beyond the knee. The kneeskin resembles a &quot;shortie&quot; style wetsuit only made of drag-reducing fabric instead of neoprene and commonly features a zippered back. Most competitive swimwear brands such as the Speedo LZR Racer line, Tyr Sport, Inc. and Arena Powerskin line produce suits of this type. As with most technologically advanced fabric swimwear, kneeskin suits are only commonly used at highly competitive levels of the swimming sport and are known to sell for prices in excess of US$200.

=== Jammer ===
A jammer, also called a swim jammer, is a style of swimsuit worn by male swimmers, used mainly in competition to obtain speed advantages. They are generally made of nylon and lycra/spandex material, but may be made of polyester, and have a form fitting design to reduce water resistance. The materials usually dry fairly quickly. They provide moderate coverage from the mid-waist to the area above the knee, somewhat resembling cycling shorts or compression shorts worn by many athletes. They provide greater leg coverage than swim briefs and square leg suits, although they also have slightly more water resistance.

=== Legskin ===
A legskin is a type of competitive swimwear worn by male swimmers. Most legskins are made of technologically advanced lycra-based fabrics designed to hug the body tightly and provide increased speed and decreased drag resistance in the water. The legskin covers from the swimmer&#x27;s mid-waist to his ankle and resembles leggings. One advantage of the legskin over other suit styles that cover the arms is flexibility, especially for strokes that require broad arm movement.

Since 2009, legskins have been banned for competition swimming by FINA since they gave an unfair advantage to swimmers who wore them; the ban includes bodysuits.

=== Racerback ===

A racerback is a type of women&#x27;s swimsuit design common today among competitive swimwear and incorporated into some types of women&#x27;s clothing. The top-back of the swimsuit is not covered to provide flexibility and movement of the arms during swimming.

=== Square cut ===
The square cut or square leg style suit is a form-fitting male swimsuit used as a slightly less revealing style than swim briefs for water polo and diving, or for recreational wear. Like swim briefs, they are made of a nylon and spandex blend. They typically sit low on the waist and high on the thigh, but provide more coverage for the upper leg than briefs. The square-cut style was popular as a recreational swimsuit for men during the 1950s.

Suits of this type are named for the coverage that they provide to the upper thighs due to a square seam opening for the leg. Square leg suits range in appearance from those similar to swim briefs with a slightly straighter front and wider side panelling (eliminating the arc appearance on the leg), to those resembling boxer briefs by providing an inch or more of fabric coverage over the upper section of the leg.

The square leg suit of the 1970s made a fashion revival in Australia in 2002 with the introduction of colorful floral and retro geometric patterned suits by swimwear label Funky Trunks. The style is popular amongst competitive swimmers for pool training and for recreational swimmers in the pool and at the beach.

<doc id="1335182" wikidata="Q2002828" url="?curid=1335182" title="Bomberman II">
<text>, released in Europe and Australia as Dynablaster, is a maze video game developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Entertainment System originally in Japan and Europe in 1991 and later in North America in February 1993.

==Gameplay==
The game follows the classic &quot;Bomberman&quot; formula and it is based directly on the 1990 &quot;Bomberman&quot; video game. Players control Bomberman, who is in a room full of blocks and enemies and must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.

Passwords are given after a game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts, allowing players to continue where they left off.

New to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a two-player mode, while Battle Mode is a three-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the three-player mode.

==Plot==
Bomberman is framed for terrible crimes by Black Bomber. After being accused of robbing a bank, Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman&#x27;s mission is to escape his prison cell and bring the Black Bomber to justice.

<doc id="1335191" wikidata="Q1339959" url="?curid=1335191" title="River Enborne">
<text>The River Enborne is a river that rises near the villages of Inkpen and West Woodhay, to the West of Newbury, Berkshire and flows into the River Kennet. Its source is in the county of Berkshire, and part of its course forms the border between Berkshire and Hampshire. Despite the name, the river does not run through the village of Enborne, although it does run through Enborne Row.

==Geography==
From its source near the villages of Inkpen and Woodhay, the Enborne flows Eastwards towards Newbury. At Smith&#x27;s Bridge, near Holtwood the river is also now the boundary between Berkshire and Hampshire. Continuing East the river is crossed by the A34 (Newbury bypass) at Enborne Row to the South of Newbury. Near here to the South is &quot;The Chase&quot; and &quot;Great Pen Wood,&quot; woodland managed by the National Trust. It flows due east touching part of Wash Common and then along the boundary of Sandleford and Highclere, reaching Newtown, Hampshire. At Sandleford and Newtown, near the Newbury to Whitchurch road, there was a mill, and here too, circa 1780, Capability Brown gave Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, of Sandleford, plans to ornament the river. Forty years earlier in 1743 Mrs Montagu described the river, then also known as the Alder stream, to her friend the Duchess of Portland: &#x27;A silver stream washes the foot of the village [Newtown]; health, pleasure, and refreshment are the ingredients that qualify this spring; no debauch, or intoxication, arises from its source&#x27;. It then passes to the South of Greenham Common, and here, near Headley, the river is joined by a tributary from the South, from Ecchinswell and Watership Down Hill.

The river continues meandering its way across open farmland towards Brimpton Common. At Inwood Copse a change in the landscape sends the river to the northeast, and it no longer forms the border between Hampshire and Berkshire. It joins the River Kennet between the villages of Aldermaston and Aldermaston Wharf.

==The river in fiction==
The river plays a significant part in Richard Adams&#x27; novel, &quot;Watership Down&quot;. Early in the book, the rabbits from Sandleford are threatened by a dog. Blackberry realises that they can float across on a wooden board, and thus they make their escape.

Available in both fuel injected and carburetted configurations, the 7K produces much more power and torque compared to the other K engines however it is a lot less &#x27;rev happy&#x27; due to having such a long stroke.

7K-E is available in KR42 Townace SBV vans (1997–2007) using a large G52 5 speed gearbox (same bellhousing to box pattern as W55), or automatic.

Applications:

<doc id="1335198" wikidata="Q7712607" url="?curid=1335198" title="The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle">
<text>The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle is a picaresque novel by the Scottish author Tobias Smollett, first published in 1751 and revised and published again in 1758. It tells the story of an egotistical man who experiences luck and misfortunes in the height of 18th-century European society.

==Plot summary==

The novel begins with the character of Peregrine as a young country gentleman rejected by his cruel mother, ignored by his indifferent father, and hated by his degenerate brother. After their alienation, he turns to Commodore Hawser Trunnion, who raises him.

Peregrine&#x27;s detailed life experience provides a scope for Smollett&#x27;s satire on human cruelty, stupidity, and greed: from his upbringing, education at Oxford, journey to France, jailing at the Fleet, and unexpected succession to his father&#x27;s fortune and his final repentance and marriage to his beloved Emilia. The novel is written as a series of adventures, with every chapter depicting a new experience. The novel also contains a lengthy independent story called &quot;The Memoirs of a Lady of Quality&quot;, written by Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane.

&quot;Peregrine Pickle&quot; features several amusing characters, most notably Commodore Hawser Trunnion, an old seaman and misogynist who lives in a house with his former shipmates. Trunnion&#x27;s lifestyle may have inspired Charles Dickens to create the character of Wemmick in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Another interesting character is Peregrine&#x27;s friend Cadwallader Crabtree, an old misanthrope who amuses himself by playing ingenious jokes on naive people.

Smollett also caricatured many of his enemies in the novel, most notably Henry Fielding and the actor David Garrick. Fitzroy Henry Lee was supposedly the model for Hawser Trunnion.

==Criticism==
George Orwell, writing in the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1944, said regarding the novels &quot;Roderick Random&quot; and &quot;Peregrine Pickle&quot;:

:Peregrine devotes himself for months at a time to the elaborate and horribly cruel practical jokes in which the eighteenth century delighted. When, for instance, an unfortunate English painter is thrown into the Bastille for some trifling offence and is about to be released, Peregrine and his friends, playing on his ignorance of the language, let him think he has been sentenced to be broken on a wheel. A little later they tell him that his punishment has been commuted to castration. Why are these petty rogueries worth reading about? In the first place because they are funny. Secondly, by simply ruling out &#x27;good&#x27; motives and showing no respect whatsoever for human dignity, Smollett attains a truthfulness that more serious novelists have missed.

==Legacy==

&quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot; is notable for providing the first printed use of the nautical expression &quot;Ahoy!&quot; in the English language (in the form &quot;a hoy!&quot;).

George P. Upton published the &quot;Letters of Peregrine Pickle&quot; in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; from 1866 to 1869 as weekly letters and then in book forms.

<text>Illinois Route 8 (IL 8) is an east–west state route in central Illinois. It runs east from Illinois Route 97 south of Maquon to the intersection of U.S. Route 24 (McClugage Avenue) and Business U.S. 24 near Washington. Illinois 8 is long.

== Route description ==

Illinois 8 largely parallels Interstate 74 from Maquon to Washington. After entering Peoria from the west, it crosses the Illinois River with Illinois Route 116 on the Cedar Street Bridge between Peoria and East Peoria. Illinois 8/116 stays joined until Camp Street, where U.S. Route 24 and Illinois Route 29/116 continue geographically northeast, and are signed east and north, respectively, with U.S. Route 150 westbound, forming a wrong-way concurrency. Illinois 8 turns east onto Camp Street with U.S. 150 eastbound. In spite of this concurrency, up until 2005 the eastbound I-74 exit to Camp Street was only marked for U.S. 150, while the next eastbound exit to Washington Street was marked as &quot;To Illinois 8&quot; even though Washington Street is unnumbered in East Peoria. At the Washington Street intersection, U.S. 150 leaves Illinois 8 and runs east-southeast towards Morton, while Illinois 8 runs east-northeast through unincorporated Sunnyland.

Near Washington, Illinois 8 turns westbound onto Business U.S. 24 (despite being signed as East Illinois 8) to terminate at U.S. 24.

== History ==
SBI Route 8 ran from Gulfport on U.S. Route 34 at the Iowa state line to Sheldon on U.S. Route 24 at the Indiana state line. It was truncated in 1965, with some of its segments moving to its modern alignment from Illinois Routes 78 and 116

West Farmington Road from Illinois Route 116 (West Plank Road) through West Peoria to Illinois Route 8 (West Southport Road) was marked as &quot;Spur-IL-8&quot; until 1970. This was a popular route to Bradley University area (West Main Street, North University Drive). Today, the route is marked as Farmington Road and not numbered.

<doc id="1335214" wikidata="Q2979779" url="?curid=1335214" title="Homer's Enemy">
<text>&quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; is the twenty-third episode of the eighth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 4, 1997. &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; was directed by Jim Reardon and written by John Swartzwelder, based on an idea pitched by executive producer Bill Oakley.

In the episode, Frank Grimes is hired as a new employee at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite Homer&#x27;s attempts to befriend him, Grimes is provoked by Homer&#x27;s laziness and incompetence. He decides to make Homer his enemy, and tries to expose his flaws through public humiliation. In the subplot, Bart buys a run-down factory for a dollar. The episode explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic hired for a job where he has to work alongside a man like Homer.

Grimes was partially modeled after Michael Douglas&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Falling Down&quot;, while Hank Azaria based aspects of his portrayal of the character on actor William H. Macy. Frank Welker guest stars as the voice of the dog whom Mr. Burns wants as his executive vice president. In its original broadcast on the Fox network, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; acquired a 7.7 Nielsen rating. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th. &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; is considered to be one of the darkest episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and it split critical opinion. It is a favorite of several members of the production staff, including Swartzwelder, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein and Matt Groening, but it is one of the least favorites of Mike Reiss.

==Plot==
After spending most of his life alone and working hard to make ends meet, Frank Grimes is hired at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant after Mr. Burns learns of Grimes&#x27;s hardship in a human-interest piece on the local news. Originally scouted to become the SNPP&#x27;s Executive Vice-President, Grimes is later assigned to Sector 7G after another local news story moves Burns to hire a heroic dog to the EVP position instead. In 7G, Grimes must work alongside Homer Simpson and his two friends Lenny and Carl, quickly becoming aghast at Homer&#x27;s laziness and incompetence, particularly after learning that he is the plant&#x27;s safety inspector.

When Grimes prevents Homer from accidentally drinking a flask of sulfuric acid by knocking it from his hands, Mr. Burns admonishes Grimes and reduces his salary, as the spilled acid destroyed a wall. Outraged, Grimes declares that he and Homer are now enemies. At Moe Szyslak&#x27;s suggestion, Homer invites Grimes to his house for a lobster dinner, hoping to make amends. However, Grimes only grows more incensed by Homer&#x27;s ability to live a comparatively more comfortable and successful life despite his sloth and ignorance, while Grimes has worked hard his entire life and has little to show for it. Denouncing Homer as a fraud, Grimes leaves in a fit of rage.

Meanwhile, after being dragged along to city hall by Marge for the purchase of a personalized license plate, Bart buys an abandoned factory for a dollar at a foreclosure auction. He and Milhouse spend their days wrecking the building until it collapses one night during Milhouse&#x27;s watch, causing the rats in the building to swarm into Moe&#x27;s Tavern.

Homer attempts to follow Marge&#x27;s suggestion by acting as a model employee to impress Grimes, but his efforts fail as he is just as incompetent as before. Grimes rants to Lenny and Carl about Homer&#x27;s obvious incompetence, but they insist that, despite his faults, Homer is a decent person. Instead of calming down, Grimes decides to prove Homer&#x27;s lack of intelligence by tricking him into entering a children&#x27;s contest to design a nuclear power plant in an attempt to humiliate him in front of everyone. Grimes&#x27;s plan backfires when Homer&#x27;s derivative model wins the contest and, when Homer&#x27;s co-workers applaud rather than ridicule him, Grimes has a nervous breakdown and runs amok in the plant, mocking Homer&#x27;s habits by imitating them. When Grimes gets carried away by grabbing hold of high-voltage wires without safety gloves, he is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes&#x27;s funeral, Homer falls asleep and talks in his dream, making Reverend Lovejoy and the attendees laugh as Grimes&#x27;s coffin is lowered into the earth.

==Production==
&quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; was written by John Swartzwelder, directed by Jim Reardon and executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. One of the goals of Oakley and Weinstein was to create several episodes in each season that would &quot;push the envelope conceptually.&quot; The idea for the episode was first conceived by Bill Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a &quot;real world&quot; co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.

&quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In an essay for the book &quot;Leaving Springfield&quot;, Robert Sloane describes the episode as &quot;an incisive consideration of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27;s world. Although &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is known for its self-reflectivity, the show had never looked at (or critiqued) itself as directly as it does in [&#x27;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&#x27;].&quot; In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard-working and persevering &quot;real American hero,&quot; is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. In an interview with &quot;Simpsons&quot; fan site NoHomers.net, Josh Weinstein said:

The animators and character designers had a lot of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a &quot;burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut&quot;, but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie &quot;Falling Down&quot; and director Jim Reardon&#x27;s college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. Among few others, the producers considered asking Nicolas Cage to play Grimes but decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, &quot;I based the character on William Macy. I can&#x27;t really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior.&quot; The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role on which he worked the hardest, adding &quot;I think it&#x27;s the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution.&quot;

Josh Weinstein has expressed regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as &quot;such an amazing character.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Believer&quot;, producer George Meyer said, &quot;Grimes&#x27;s cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And the people who do that tend to become martyrs. He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I&#x27;ll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. He was such a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying.&quot; Lisa has few speaking lines in the episode, due to Yeardley Smith getting the flu after recording all of her lines in &quot;In Marge We Trust&quot;, making this episode one of the four times Lisa has a minor role in a Season 8 episode, the others being &quot;Bart After Dark&quot;, &quot;Grade School Confidential&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase&quot;.

The subplot, where Bart buys a factory, was added so that there would be some lighter scenes to split up the main plot. According to Weinstein, &quot;We wanted to have a Bart or Lisa kids&#x27; story to contrast the heaviness and reality of Frank Grimes.&quot;

==Reception==
In its original broadcast on the Fox network, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; acquired a 7.7 Nielsen rating. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was the sixth-highest-rated show on Fox the week it was broadcast, behind &quot;The X-Files&quot;, a broadcast of the film &quot;The Mask&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. In Australia, the episode premiered on June 29, 1997, while in the UK it premiered on August 10, 1997.
According to Josh Weinstein, when the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor that he thinks many fans &quot;didn&#x27;t get.&quot; Weinstein also talks about a &quot;generation gap&quot;—he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, described the episode as &quot;one of the series&#x27; darkest episodes [that] ends on a real downer but is nevertheless also one of the wittiest and cleverest in ages.&quot; Similarly, comedian Rick Mercer called it a &quot;great episode, and one of the darkest ever produced.&quot;

Many critics have listed &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; as one of the best episodes of the series, including John Orvted of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Entertainment.ie, Screen Rant, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Frank Grimes as number 17 on a list of &quot;The Top 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Peripheral characters&quot;, making him the least-frequently shown character to appear in that list.

Several members of the staff have included the episode among their favorites. In a 2000 &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article, Matt Groening ranked it as his sixth favorite &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode. It is also a personal favorite of Josh Weinstein, who cites the scene when Grimes visits the Simpson home as one of his favorite scenes, while &quot;The Office&quot; creator Ricky Gervais has called it &quot;the most complete episode.&quot; In her autobiography &quot;My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy&quot;, Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, praises Azaria&#x27;s performance as Grimes, and uses it as an example of how &quot;Accent, pitch, pacing, range and intention&quot; can allow an actor to voice many characters. She writes,
In his only interview to date, John Swartzwelder listed the episode as among his favorites that he wrote. When asked about the dark ending, he replied &quot;Grimey was asking for it the whole episode. He didn’t approve of our Homer. He was asking for it, and he got it.&quot;

However, former &quot;Simpsons&quot; executive producer Mike Reiss listed &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; as one of his two least favorite episodes, stating, &quot;I just think the episode was in bad taste.&quot; Likewise, Jon Bonné of MSNBC used &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; as an example of a bad episode of the eighth season and wrote &quot;even now [in 2000], when subsequent episodes have debased Homer in new and innovative ways, the Grimes episode stands out as painful to watch.&quot;

In August 2014, writing for &quot;The Verge&quot;, Chris Plante listed &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; as one of his favorite episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and Homer falling asleep and talking in his dream at Grimes&#x27;s funeral as one of the funniest moments in the show, but he cited the latter as the moment the series jumped the shark, because of the impact it &quot;has on the show&#x27;s character [Homer], and through that character, the world.&quot; As of 2023, the episode held an average rating of 9.3 (out of a possible 10) from user reviews on IMDb, the highest for the series.

In a roundtable discussion in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Erik Adams says the episode &quot;saves itself from its own cruelty, however. It’s an expertly written &quot;Simpsons&quot; installment with a simple starting point—who could dislike Homer Simpson?—and a well-paced, hilarious, multiple-part answer to that question.&quot; Noel Murray writes that &quot;There’s an element of nose-thumbing to &#x27;Homer’s Enemy,&#x27; which may explain why it rubs some &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans the wrong way. But that defiant attitude is fairly exhilarating, too. The final injustice for Frank Grimes is that at his funeral, Reverend Lovejoy says that Frank liked to be called &#x27;Grimey,&#x27; which he most definitely did not. That was just Homer’s lazy nickname for him. It’s another example of how everything falls into place around Homer, and how the only way to respond to that reality is either to laugh it off or to get yourself buried.&quot;

==Legacy==
Despite his minimal screen time in the series overall, Frank Grimes has since been referenced many times in the show, often showing his tombstone, and occasionally mentioning him by name. In the season fourteen episode &quot;The Great Louse Detective&quot;, it is revealed that he fathered a son named Frank Grimes Jr., who tries and fails to kill Homer. The footage of Grimes&#x27;s death is also shown during the episode. He also appears in season twenty-six, as an angel with a halo in the opening sequence of &quot;My Fare Lady&quot;, as Homer is exiting his work place. In the non-canon season twenty-eight episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVII&quot;, the ghost of Frank Grimes joins Sideshow Bob&#x27;s army of the Simpsons&#x27; enemies.

During the nuclear power plant design contest, one of the entrants is Ralph Wiggum, whose entry is rejected by Mr. Burns. When Ralph does not leave the stage, Chief Wiggum says &quot;Ralphie, get off the stage, sweetheart.&quot; This line was later used as the chorus in the song &quot;Ralph Wiggum&quot; by the Bloodhound Gang.

In February 2000, the cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; performed a live reading of the episode script at the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado.

In an interview with &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; in January 2023, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; writer Jeff Loveness, who went to write the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) feature film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023), cited &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; and the Frank Grimes character for inspiring the film&#x27;s portrayal of Darren Cross / M.O.D.O.K., portrayed by Corey Stoll.

<text>The Utah Pride Festival is a festival held in downtown Salt Lake City in June celebrating Utah&#x27;s diversity and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) community. The event is a program of the Utah Pride Center, and includes the state&#x27;s second-largest parade, after the Days of &#x27;47 Parade.

==Festivities==

The festival includes the parade, a film festival, the Dyke March, members of the Bear Clan, Leathermen, and the Sisters of bondage subcultures, an interfaith service by the Utah Pride Interfaith Coalition, 5K charity run, and related parties and receptions.

Participation in the festival cuts across a broad spectrum of Utahans. Past speakers during the celebration have ranged from Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson, who was quoted in support of same sex marriage, to Utah Rep. Jackie Biskupski, the state&#x27;s first openly lesbian legislator (later became Salt Lake City&#x27;s first openly lesbian mayor).

The festival&#x27;s last day (Sunday) begins with the parade. Participants have included Mayor Ralph Becker, County Mayor Ben McAdams, a group of uniformed Boy Scouts, the largest group - Mormons Building Bridges, Mormons for Equality, the Provo Pride Council, Westminster College (Utah), and Weber State University. Over 140 organizations, sponsors, and religious groups participate. A large rainbow flag fills the street at the back of the parade.

==History==

The festival began in 1977 when the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights sponsored a three-day conference. (then called Gay Mormons United) was founded during this conference, on June 11. The 1978 keynote speakers were David Kopay, the first NFL player to come out of the closet, and U.S. Air Force Sgt. Leonard Matlovich, an ex-Mormon who was the first openly gay person to appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Utah Pride Inc. was created in 1989 through 2004 as a project of the Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah. The project was renamed Pride of Utah in 2006.

The first Pride march in the state was held June 27, 1990 at the state capitol building. It began on the steps of the capitol, went down Main street, and ended on South Temple at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (then the Salt Lake Art Center). It included a procession of 270. In 1991, the Utah Stonewall Center opened and Pride festivities moved to the Salt Lake County Fairgrounds in Murray, Utah. The march attracted twice as many participants along with opposition by members of the Aryan Nation. The Pride Day Art Expo and Competition was created to award local artists with its Lesbian and Gay Pride Art Award and the Mapplethorpe Award.

In 1997, a football field-length pride flag was made to carry down the parade route. It was produced by Rev. Bruce Barton of the Metropolitan Community Church of Salt Lake City, UT along with a dozen helpers (including Bruce Harmon, Jeff Freedman, Carrie Gayler, Lynn Sasaki, Terry Gillman and Garth Snyder) who called it a &quot;tremendous symbol of pride and unity.&quot; Completed the day of the parade (June 8 at 4:15 am), this 300 foot long flag was composed of 35 bolts of lightweight fabric in six colors. It took more than 80 hours to sew. Over 100 marchers would hold the sides. People often threw donations onto the flag, and children would run around underneath. The first flag bearers were members of the Utah Gay and Lesbian Youth group and some others that did not belong to a community organization. They took it from the Utah State Capitol Building, down State Street, past the LDS Church Office Building, and on to the Salt Lake City and County Building. By 2012, the original flag had seen better days, and a new one from Colonial Flag was purchased for $5,000. It is 30x200 feet and made of nylon, with hand holds every 18 inches. Also, Utah Pride Center gifted Moab Pride their own 100 foot flag.

In 2004, an estimated 50,000 people attended, the largest since the festival began. However, in 2005, the first year in which an admission was charged, attendance at the festival was 15,000 to 20,000. Some have attributed this decline to patrons not wanting to pay for admission to the festival. Festival organizers argued that it was the first year in which an accurate method of counting the attendance was employed and that the numbers did not reflect a drop in attendance.

In 2011 the first local pride festival was held in Moab, Utah.

The 2012 festival included performers Frenchie Davis and Prince Poppycock

In 2013, pride spread to Provo, Utah, with their first pride.

In 2014, Mayor Ralph Becker threw a private wedding reception for couples whose marriages he performed on the first day that same-sex marriage became legal in Utah.

Pride reached Ogden, Utah, in 2015 when they held their first pride festival.

2016 was the first year panel discussions were held during the festival, inside the Salt Lake City Public Library.

2020 saw the festival postponed till September due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but ultimately happened in October, with the First Utah Pride Road Ralley.2021 was restructured as a Pride Week, much like early pride festivals of the early 1990s due to the ongoing wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and issues with ensuring proper health for the populace with vaccinated/unvaccinated peoples. Events included walk through exhibits, online inter-faith, and a march starting near the Utah State Capitol building at 300 North State St., marchers carried the 300 foot rainbow flag and the first balloon arch. The flag and balloon arch marched down State Street and met the next balloon arch, and then the next balloon arch, and the next, until all had joined together to create a massive balloon arch of over 1000 balloons, as the march reached Harvey Milk Boulevard and 600 east at Liberty Park.

<text>Batak is a collective term used to identify a number of closely related Austronesian ethnic groups predominantly found in North Sumatra, Indonesia, who speak Batak languages. The term is used to include the Karo, Pakpak, Simalungun, Toba, Angkola, Mandailing and related ethnic groups with distinct languages and traditional customs (&quot;adat&quot;).

== Prehistory ==
While the archaeology of southern Sumatra testifies to the existence of neolithic settlers, it seems that the northern part of Sumatra was settled by agriculturalists at a considerably later stage.

Although the Batak are often considered to be isolated peoples due to their location inland, away from the influence of seafaring European colonials, there is evidence that they have been involved in trade with neighbouring kingdoms for a millennium or more.

===Influenced by Tamil Peoples===

The Bataks practiced a syncretic religion of Shaivism, Buddhism and local culture for thousands of years. The last Batak king who fought against the Dutch until 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in Zhao Rugua&#x27;s 13th-century &quot;Description of the Barbarous Peoples&quot;, which refers to a &#x27;Ba-ta&#x27; dependency of Srivijaya. The &quot;Suma Oriental&quot;, of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by Pasai and the Aru kingdom.

Based on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with China, perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.

It has been suggested that the important port of Barus in Tapanuli was populated by Batak people. A Tamil inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at Kota Cina, a trading town located in what is now northern Medan that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.

These trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun &#x27;frontier&#x27; lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for camphor.

The Karo &quot;marga&quot; or tribe &quot;Sembiring&quot; &quot;black one&quot; is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with Pagarruyung in Minangkabau Highlands.

From the 16th century onward, Aceh increased the production of pepper, an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either &quot;sawah&quot; (wet rice fields) or &quot;ladang&quot; (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.

==Language==


The Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the Austronesian language family. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the Pakpak-Dairi, Alas-Kluet and Karo languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: Toba, Angkola and Mandailing. Simalungun is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in Medan city today.

The Batak possess their own script known as the &quot;Surat Batak&quot;. The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.

===Contribution to modern Malay and Indonesian literature===

In the broader context of national language, the modern Batak authors are well-known as the outstanding Malay-speaking writers that shape modern Malay into the national concept of &quot;Bahasa Indonesia&quot; (Indonesian language) and its literary canon. These include novelist Merari Siregar (&quot;Azab dan Sengsara&quot;), Muhammad Kasim Dalimunte (&quot;Teman Doedoek&quot;), Soeman Hasiboean (&quot;Kawan Bergeloet&quot; and &quot;Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan&quot;), Mochtar Lubis (&quot;Senja di Jakarta&quot;) and Iwan Simatupang (&quot;Ziarah&quot;); poets Sitor Situmorang; as well as literary critic Bakri Siregar.

==Profession==

The traditional occupation of the Batak was agriculture, hunting and farming. The great lake of Toba provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals.

The port of Barus on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of &quot;kapur barus&quot; (camphor). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, &quot;sawit&quot; palm oil, and rubber, converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.
Throughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, military officers, and attorneys. Although the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58%; only 8–9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010&#x27;s census), a large number of notable Batak have achieved prominent places and well-represented especially in the field of law, such as Adnan Buyung Nasution who founded the Lembaga Bantuan Hukum Jakarta (LBH Jakarta), Todung Mulya Lubis, Ruhut Sitompul and Hotman Paris Hutapea. 
==Society==

Batak societies are patriarchally organized along clans known as &quot;Marga&quot;. A traditional belief among the Toba Batak is that they originate from one ancestor &quot;Si Raja Batak&quot;, with all &quot;Margas&quot; descended from him. A family tree that defines the father-son relationship among Batak people is called &quot;tarombo&quot;. In contemporary Indonesia, the Batak people have a strong focus on education and a prominent position in the professions, particularly as teachers, engineers, doctors and lawyers. Toba Batak are known traditionally for their weaving, wood carving and especially ornate stone tombs.

Before they became subjects of the colonial Dutch East Indies government, the Batak had a reputation for being fierce warriors. Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the HKBP (&quot;Huria Kristen Batak Protestan&quot;) Christian church. The dominant Christian theology was brought by Lutheran German missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by Dutch Calvinist missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (&quot;Gereja Batak Karo Protestan&quot;). The Mandailing and Angkola Batak were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the reign of Minangkabaus Padri. A significant minority of Batak people do not adhere to either Christianity or Islam, however, and follow traditional practices known as the &quot;agama si dekah&quot;, the old religion, which is also called &quot;perbegu&quot; or &quot;pemena&quot;.
=== Dalihan Na Tolu ===

&quot;Dalihan Na Tolu&quot; (three-legged furnace) is the philosophy of life of the Batak people. It consisted of three general rules in Batak society. Those are:
# Somba Marhulahula (showing respect to wife&#x27;s family). Even though &quot;somba&quot; could mean worship, in Dalihan Na Tolu, it means respect to those with wife family and those with the same clan (Marga (Batak)). Those family includes wife of the grandfathers, wife of the fathers, and wife of the children.
# Elek Marboru (showing kindness to all women). Kindness in this context means not accompanied by ulterior motives and self-interest. Also, women in this context means the family who marry the daughter, including the daughter itself.
# Manat Mardongan Tubu (careful in living with close relatives). Living carefully means a cautious attitude towards fellow Marga to prevent misunderstandings in the implementation of custom tradition events. This act was reflected in the Batak proverb &quot;hau na jonok do na boi marsiogoson&quot; (only woods that are really close can cause friction). This illustrates that it is in close and frequent intercourse that possible conflicts of interest, status, etc. can occur
The essence of this teachings is the moral code contains the teachings of mutual respect (&quot;masipasangapon&quot;) with the support of the moral rule: mutual respect and helpfulness.

===Ritual cannibalism===
Ritual cannibalism was well documented among pre-colonial Batak people, being performed in order to strengthen the eater&#x27;s &quot;tendi&quot;. In particular, the blood, heart, palms and soles of the feet were seen as rich in &quot;tendi&quot;.

In Marco Polo’s memoirs of his stay on the east coast of Sumatra (then called Java Minor) from April to September 1292, he mentions an encounter with hill folk whom he refers to as &quot;man-eaters&quot;. From secondary sources, Marco Polo recorded stories of ritual cannibalism among the &quot;Battas&quot;. Marco Polo&#x27;s stay was restricted to the coastal areas, and he never ventured inland to directly verify such claims. Despite never personally witnessing these events, he was nonetheless willing to pass on descriptions which were provided to him, in which a condemned man was eaten: &quot;They suffocate him. And when he is dead they have him cooked, and gather together all the dead man&#x27;s kin, and eat him. And I assure you they do suck the very bones till not a particle of marrow remains in them...And so they eat him up stump and rump. And when they have thus eaten him they collect his bones and put them in fine chests, and carry them away, and place them in caverns among the mountains where no beast nor other creature can get at them. And you must know also that if they take prisoner a man of another country, and he cannot pay a ransom in coin, they kill him and eat him straightway.

The Venetian Niccolò de&#x27; Conti (1395–1469) spent most of 1421 in Sumatra in the course of a long trading journey to Southeast Asia (1414–1439), and wrote a brief description of the inhabitants: &quot;In a part of the island called Batech live cannibals who wage continual war on their neighbors.&quot;


Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles in the 1820s studied the Batak and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. Raffles stated that &quot;It is usual for the people to eat their parents when too old to work,&quot; and that for certain crimes a criminal would be eaten alive: &quot;The flesh is eaten raw or grilled, with lime, salt and a little rice.&quot;

The German physician and geographer Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn visited the Batak lands between 1840 and 1841. Junghuhn says about cannibalism among the Batak (whom he called &quot;Battaer&quot;): 
&quot;People do the honest Battaer an injustice when it is said that they sell human flesh in the markets, and that they slaughter their old people as soon as they are unfit for work...They eat human flesh only in wartime, when they are enraged, and in a few legal instances.&quot;
Junghuhn tells how after a perilous and hungry flight he arrived in a friendly village, and the food that was offered by his hosts was the flesh of two prisoners who had been slaughtered the day before, however he maintains that the Batak exaggerated their love of human flesh in order to frighten off would-be invaders and to gain occasional employment as mercenaries for the coastal tribes who were plagued by pirates.

Oscar von Kessel visited Silindung in the 1840s and in 1844 was probably the first European to observe a Batak cannibalistic ritual in which a convicted adulterer was eaten alive. His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, adultery, spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the verdict of the community and were not thinking of revenge.

Ida Laura Pfeiffer visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: 
:&quot;Prisoners of war are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice. The body is then distributed; the ears, the nose, and the soles of the feet are the exclusive property of the Rajah, who has besides a claim on other portions. The palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the flesh of the head, and the heart and liver, are reckoned peculiar delicacies, and the flesh in general is roasted and eaten with salt. The Regents assured me, with a certain air of relish, that it was very good food, and that they had not the least objection to eat it. The women are not allowed to take part in these grand public dinners.&quot;

Samuel Munson and Henry Lyman, American Baptist missionaries to the Batak, were cannibalized in 1834. Dutch and German missionaries to the Batak in the late 19th century observed a few instances of cannibalism and wrote lurid descriptions to their home parishes in order to raise donations for further missions. The growing Dutch influence in northern Sumatra led to increased Malay influence in coastal trade and plantations, pushing the Karo farther inland. Growing ethnic tensions culminated in the 1872 Karo Rebellion where the Karo were suppressed by Dutch and Malay forces. Despite this, Karo resistance to Dutch imperialism lingered into the early 20th century. In 1890 the Dutch colonial government banned cannibalism in the regions under their control. Rumors of Batak cannibalism survived into the early 20th century but it seems probable that the custom was rare after 1816, due partially to the influence of Islam.

===Tarombo===

Family tree or lineage is a very important thing for the Batak, as those who do not know the lineage will be considered as a strayed (&quot;nalilu&quot;) Batak. Batak people are required to know their lineage or at least the ancestors of which the family name (Marga (Batak)) and the related clans (&quot;dongan tubu&quot;) came from. This is necessary in order to determine the relation of a kinship (&quot;partuturanna&quot;) within a clan or simply the surname (Marga (Batak)) itself.

==Geography==

The Batak lands consist of North Sumatra province, excluding Nias island, the historically Malay kingdoms of the east coast and the western coast of Minangkabau people. In addition, part of the Karo lands extend into modern-day East Aceh Regency in Aceh province, while parts of the Mandailing lands lie in Rokan Hulu Regency in Riau. Significant numbers of Batak have migrated in recent years to prosperous neighbouring Riau province.

To the south of North Sumatra are the Muslim Minangkabau of West Sumatra, while to the north there are various Muslim Acehnese peoples.

==Traditional Batak religion==

The various Batak cultures differ in their pre-colonial religious ideas as they do in many other aspects of culture. Information about the old religious ideas of the Mandailing and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and very little is known about the religion of the Pakpak and Simalungun Batak. For the Toba and Karo on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant. Information on the traditional forms of Batak religion is derived mainly from the writings of German and Dutch missionaries who became increasingly concerned with Batak beliefs towards the end of the 19th century.

Various influences affected the Batak through their contact with Tamil and Javanese traders and settlers in southern Batakland, and the east and west coast near Barus and Tapanuli, in particular the large Padang Lawas temple complex in Tapanuli. These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, Shaivist, and Tantrist practices within their own customs.

The modern Indonesian state is founded on the principles of pancasila, which requires the belief in &#x27;one and only God&#x27;, the practice of either Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, one of which must be entered on an individual&#x27;s KTP. Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity.

===Creation myths===
There are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.

At the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld dragon &quot;Naga Padoha&quot;. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving myths record that at the beginning of creation stands the god &quot;Mula Jadi Na Bolon&quot;. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the &quot;beginning of becoming&quot;. The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, &quot;Batara Guru&quot;, &quot;Mangalabulan&quot; and &quot;Soripada&quot; were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by &quot;Mula Jadi&quot;. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; there is another god, &quot;Asiasi&quot;, whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that &quot;Asiasi&quot; can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.

The ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon &quot;Naga Padoha&quot;. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of &quot;Mula Jadi&quot;. As ruler of the underworld &quot;Naga Padoha&quot; also has an important function in the creation of the earth.

What all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of sacrifice are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.
The origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of &quot;Batara Guru&quot;, &quot;Sideak Parujar&quot;, who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,
the lizard-shaped son of &quot;Mangalabulan&quot;, and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. &quot;Sideak Parudjar&quot; was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of &quot;Naga Padoha&quot;, the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; and by her own cunning &quot;Sideak Parudjar&quot; was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of &quot;Naga Padoha&quot; up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever &quot;Naga Padoha&quot; twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.

After the lizard-shaped son of &quot;Mangalabulan&quot;, the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, &quot;Sideak Parujar&quot; marries him. &quot;Sideak Parujar&quot; becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their incestuous union.
The couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of Lake Toba, and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, &quot;Si Raja Batak&quot; is one of their grandchildren.

===The &quot;tendi&quot; cult===

In the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the &quot;tendi&quot; (Karo) or &quot;tondi&quot; (Toba) and the &quot;begu&quot;. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are &quot;life-soul&quot; and &quot;death-soul&quot;. A person receives his &quot;life-soul&quot; (&quot;tendi&quot;) from &quot;Mula Jadi Na Bolon&quot; before he is born. The destiny of the individual &quot;tendi&quot; is decided by the &quot;tendi&quot; itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the &quot;tendi&quot; choose their destiny from &quot;Mula Jadi&quot;. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (&quot;ephorus&quot;) of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion. What is significant is that the &quot;tendi&quot; themselves are responsible for their destiny:

:&quot;&quot;Mula Jadi&quot; presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the &quot;tendi&quot; asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts.&quot;

:&quot;With &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; in the upper world is a mighty tree called &quot;Djambubarus&quot;. &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written &#x27;many children&#x27;, on others &#x27;wealth&#x27; or &#x27;respect&#x27; and so on. &#x27;Contemptible life&#x27;, &#x27;poverty&#x27;, &#x27;wretchedness&#x27; are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every &quot;tendi&quot; that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask &quot;Mula Jadi&quot; for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world.&quot;

Among the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the &quot;tendi&quot; dwells and how many &quot;tendi&quot; there are. According to the Toba a person has seven &quot;tendi&quot;. The second &quot;tendi&quot; is found in the placenta and amniotic fluid of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called &quot;saudara&quot; (brother) and is regarded as the person&#x27;s guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (&quot;kaka&quot; and &quot;agi&quot;) who always remain close to the person.

All Batak regard the loss of &quot;tendi&quot; as signifying a great danger for &quot;body and soul&quot;. &quot;Tendi&quot; can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a &quot;datu&quot; with evil intentions. In other words, the &quot;tendi&quot; is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the &quot;tendi&quot; inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the &quot;tendi&quot; dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in &quot;tendi&quot;. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of &quot;tendi&quot;, and the bringing back of the &quot;tendi&quot; is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called &quot;upah tendi&quot; (&quot;upah&quot; = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their &quot;tendi&quot; so that their &quot;tendi&quot; stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the &quot;tendi&quot; satisfied.

&quot;Tendi&quot; love the sound of the &quot;surdam&quot; (a bamboo flute). If a &quot;tendi&quot; has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the &quot;surdam&quot; in the &quot;raleng tendi&quot; ritual can contribute to the &quot;tendi&quot; returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the &quot;datuk&quot; are in a position to interpret and influence people&#x27;s &quot;tendi&quot; correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the &quot;tendi&quot; has chosen another destiny for itself.

===Death cult===
At death the &quot;tendi&quot; leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the &quot;death-soul&quot; (&quot;begu&quot;) is set free. It is thought that the &quot;tendi&quot; vanishes and after the death of any human being only the &quot;begu&quot; continues to exist. The Batak believe that the &quot;begu&quot; continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the
cemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the &quot;begu&quot; of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged &quot;begu&quot; by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a &quot;datu&quot; or a &quot;guru&quot; must be called in. The &quot;begu&quot; are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a &quot;begu&quot; dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.

The Batak believe that three categories of &quot;begu&quot; exist. The &quot;bicara guru&quot; are the &quot;begu&quot; of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn &quot;bicara guru&quot; into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a &quot;guru sibaso&quot;, the &quot;bicara guru&quot; can be made the family&#x27;s guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the &quot;bicara guru&quot; is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.

The &quot;begu&quot; of members of the family who have had a sudden death (&quot;mate sada-uari&quot;) can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the &quot;begu&quot; of dead virgins (&quot;tungkup&quot;). Their graves, called &quot;bata-bata&quot; or &quot;ingan tungkup&quot;, are maintained for a long time by their relatives.

===Burial traditions===
Batak burial traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the &quot;begu&quot; understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with camphor and its orifices stopped with camphor, then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this &quot;perumah begu&quot; ceremony a &quot;guru sibaso&quot; declares to the &quot;begu&quot; of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.

Wealthier families have their coffins (Karo: &quot;pelangkah&quot;) made of the wood of the &quot;kemiri&quot; tree (&quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a hornbill, or a horse, or a mythical beast known as a singa. The lid is then sealed with resin and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family&#x27;s house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.

The corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the cemetery with musical accompaniment from the &quot;gondang&quot; orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the &quot;begu&quot;. It is hoped that the &quot;begu&quot; will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of &quot;datuk&quot; and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and betel placed between them.

===Reburial===
The burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one&#x27;s ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as &quot;mangongkal holi&quot;, among the Karo as &quot;nurun-nurun&quot;. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a &quot;tugu&quot; or &quot;tambak&quot;:
:&quot;On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various citrus fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the &quot;tugu&quot; until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (&quot;ulos&quot;) and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the &quot;tugu&quot;. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.&quot;

In ancient times these sarcophagi were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate &quot;tugu&quot; can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of Samosir.

One motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the &quot;begu&quot; of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a &quot;begu&quot; to the status of a &quot;sumangot&quot; by means of a great ceremony and a &quot;horja&quot; feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the &quot;gondang&quot; orchestra provided an accompaniment.

The next level up from the &quot;sumangot&quot; is the &quot;sombaon&quot;, who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a &quot;sumangot&quot; to a &quot;sombaon&quot; requires another great festival, a &quot;santi rea&quot;, often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new kinship groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.

===Traditional Batak medicine===
In traditional Batak society &quot;datuk&quot; (animist priests) as well as &quot;gurus&quot; practiced traditional medicine, although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by dukuns in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely clandestine activities.

Both &quot;datu&quot; and &quot;guru&quot; healers also practiced divination by consulting a &quot;pustaha&quot;, a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in &quot;poda,&quot; an archaic Batak shorthand. According to Winkler, there were three categories of &quot;Pustaha&quot; based on the purpose of their usage:
:1. Protective Magic, which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as amulets, &quot;parmanisan&quot; (love charms), etc.
:2. Destructive Magic, which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the &quot;pangulubalang&quot;, and the art of making &quot;dorma&quot; (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love).
:3. Divination, which involves oracles (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an almanac or calendrical system (&quot;porhalaan&quot;), and astrology to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.

The &quot;datu&quot; or &quot;guru&quot; consulted the &quot;pustaha&quot; when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and augury the Bible may have been adopted by some &quot;gurus&quot; in place of the &quot;pustaha&quot;.

Among the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the &quot;jinujung,&quot; or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo cosmology, each person receives a &quot;jinujung&quot; in childhood or at puberty and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the &quot;jinujung&quot; back, a female &quot;guru&quot; (&quot;guru sibaso&quot; in Karo) goes into a trance and the &quot;jinujung&quot; will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.

Traditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person&#x27;s &quot;tendi&quot; (this falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;datuk&quot;); however, they do play a role in communicating with &quot;begu&quot; and influencing their behavior.

==Religions==


===Christianity===
At the time of Marco Polo&#x27;s visit in 1292 the people were described as &quot;wild idolaters&quot; who had not been influenced by outside religions, however by Ibn Battuta&#x27;s visit in 1345 Arab traders had established river-ports along the northern coasts of Sumatra and Sultan Al-Malik Al-Dhahir had recently converted to Islam.

Sir Stamford Raffles perceived the Batak lands as a buffer between the Islamic Aceh and Minang kingdoms, and encouraged Christian missionary work to preserve this. This policy was continued by the Dutch, who deemed the non-Muslim lands the &#x27;Bataklanden&#x27;.

In 1824 two British Baptist missionaries, Richard Burton and Nathaniel Ward, set off on foot from Sibolga and traveled through the Batak lands. After three days&#x27; journey they reached the high valley of Silindung and spent about two weeks in the Batak region. Considering the shortness of their stay their account reveals very intensive first-hand observation. This was followed in 1834 by Henry Lyman and Samuel Munson from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions who met with a more hostile reception. According to Ida Pfeiffer:
:&quot;Some time before the arrival of the missionaries the unfortunate Americans presented themselves as religious teachers, the Battakers felt that these people were invaders, and resolving to be beforehand with their tormentors, they killed them and ate them up.&quot;

Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk was employed by the Nederlands Bijbel Genootschap (Netherlands Bible Society) in the 1850s to produce a Batak–Dutch grammar-book and a dictionary, which enabled future Dutch and German missionaries to undertake the conversion of the Toba and Simalungan Batak.

The first German missionaries to the Lake Toba region arrived in 1861, and a mission was established in 1881 by Dr. Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen of the German Rhenish Missionary Society. The New Testament was first translated into Toba Batak by Dr. Nommensen in 1869 and a translation of the Old Testament was completed by P. H. Johannsen in 1891. The complete text was printed in Latin script in Medan in 1893, although a paper describes the translation as &quot;not easy to read, it is rigid and not fluent, and sounds strange to the Batak…[with] a number of errors in the translation.&quot;

The Toba and Karo Batak accepted Christianity rapidly and by the early 20th century it had become part of their cultural identity.

This period was characterized by the arrival of Dutch colonists and while most Batak did not oppose the Dutch, the Toba Batak fought a guerrilla war that lasted into the early 20th century and ended only with the death in 1907 of their charismatic priest-warrior-king Si Sisingamangaraja XII, who had battled the Dutch during the First Toba War with both magic and weaponry.

====Batak churches====
The Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP) Church was established in Balige in September, 1917. By the late 1920s a nursing school was training nurse midwives there. In 1941, the Gereja Batak Karo Protestan (GBKP) was established. Although missionaries ceded much power to Batak converts in the first decades of the 20th century, Bataks never pressured the missionaries to leave and only took control of church activities as a result of thousands of foreign missionaries being interned or forced to leave after the 1942 invasion of Sumatra by the Japanese.

The Gereja Kristen Protestan Simalungun, originally part of the HKBP and preaching in Batak Toba language, eventually became a distinctively Simalungun church, adopting Simalungun customs and language, before finally incorporating as GKPS in 1963.

===Islam===
The Mandailing and Angkola people, occupying the southern Batak lands, came under the influence of the neighbouring Islamic Minangkabau people as a result of the Padri War (1821–1837). Some Mandailing had previously converted to Islam, but the Padri war was a watershed event, with the Padris suppressing traditional customs (&quot;adat&quot;) and promoting &#x27;pure&#x27; Islamic faith. Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern Shafi`i school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of hajj, although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.
The advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatible with Islam. The &#x27;pasusur begu&#x27;, a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the &#x27;Raja&#x27; hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of &#x27;pele begu&#x27;. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.

Christian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as &#x27;unreachable people&#x27;, moving north to convert the Toba.

At the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the &#x27;Batak&#x27; label. Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from &#x27;Hindu&#x27; visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as &#x27;Batak Mandailing&#x27;. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed &#x27;Malays&#x27;, and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of &#x27;Batak&#x27; Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.

===Traditional Religions (Parmalim/Pemena)===


&quot;Ugamo Malim&quot; or Malim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion. Practitioners of Malim are called Parmalim.

At the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century the Parmalim movement, which originated in Toba lands spread to other areas of the Batak lands. Especially in the lower Karo lands, the &#x27;dusun&#x27; the Malim religion, became very influential as an expression of anti-colonial sentiments at the turn of the 20th century. Today the majority of Parmalim are Toba Batak. The largest of the several existing Parmalim groups has its centre in &quot;Huta Tinggi&quot; in the vicinity of &quot;Laguboti&quot; on the south shore of Lake Toba.

Non-Malim Batak peoples (those following Christian or Muslim faith) often continue to believe certain aspects of traditional Batak spiritual belief.

Another traditional religion of Batak is &quot;Pemena&quot;, is a tribal religion of Karo people of Indonesia. Pemena means the first or the beginning. Pemena is regarded as the first religion of Karo people. One of the doctrines of Pemena is the concept of &quot;Dibata&quot;.

The &#x27;Perodak-odak&#x27; movement among the Karo people in the 1960s was a reassertion of the traditional Karo religion, but has largely faded; a subsequent Karo movement to identify as Hindu was noted starting from the late 1970s in order to adopt, if only in name, one of the recognised religions of Indonesia, while in practice still following traditional beliefs.

<text>The Batak are one of about 140 indigenous peoples of the Philippines. They are located in the northeastern portions of Palawan, a relatively large island in the southwest of the archipelago. Since ancient times, the Batak have inhabited a series of river valleys along the coastline of what is today Puerto Princesa City.

There are only about 1,500 Batak remaining according to the 2020 census. Also called &quot;Tinitianes&quot;, the Batak are considered by anthropologists to be closely related to the Aeta of Central Luzon, another Negrito tribe. They tend to be small in stature, with dark skin and frizzy or curly hair, traits which originally garnered the &quot;Negrito&quot; groups their name. Still, there is some debate as to whether the Batak are related to the other Negrito groups of the Philippines or actually to other, physically similar groups in Indonesia or as far away as the Andaman Islands.

== History ==
The Batak have for centuries combined a hunting-gathering lifestyle with seeding of useful food plants, &quot;kaingin&quot;, a slash and burn farming method, and trading. The Batak had important trading connections with the maritime peoples of the Sulu region for many centuries of their history. They traded natural and forest goods in exchange for manufactured products.

The Batak were largely undisturbed until the arrival of the Americans in the final years of the nineteenth century. The reason for this was that the Bataks were within the margins of mainstream Filipino political and cultural life.

Since 1900, Filipinos and others began to migrate to the traditional regions where the Batak lived. This led to the resources and land of the Bataks dwindling. In the 1930s, the government attempted to establish reservations for the Batak in the coastal plains, but these were soon settled and overrun by Filipino migrants in the 1950s. This caused the Batak to move inland into the interior of the island.

During the mid to late 20th century, the Batak was easily pushed out of their preferred gathering grounds by the sea into the mountains by emigrant farmers, mostly from Luzon. Living in less fertile areas, they have attempted to supplement their income by harvesting and selling various nontimber forest products, such as rattan, tree resins, and honey. This has been met with resistance by the government and commercial collectors, who assert that the Batak have no legal right to these resources. Conservationists, however, have taken an interest in Batak&#x27;s collection methods, which are much more sustainable than the techniques used by commercial concessionaires.

The Batak&#x27;s way of life and survival is threatened by dwindling forest resources, partly due to mining activities. Communities also experience high infant mortality and low birth rates.

The Batak are working to acquire Certificates of Ancestral Domains Titles for their traditional lands in Puerto Princesa.

== Culture ==
The Batak were once a nomadic people, but have since, at the behest of the government, settled in small villages. Still, they often go on gathering trips into the forest for a few days at a time, an activity which has both economic and spiritual value for them. Their belief system is that of animism, which is belief in spirits that reside in nature. They classify spirits into the &quot;Panya&#x27;en&quot; who are malevolent and the &quot;Diwata&quot; are generally benevolent but are also capricious. Batak make regular offerings to these spirits, and Shamans undergo spiritual possession in order to communicate with the spirits and heal the sick.

Rapid depopulation, restricted forest access, sedentary living, and incursion by immigrants has devastated the group culturally. Today, very few Batak marry other Batak but tend to marry from other neighboring groups. The pattern has been that the children of these marriages tend not to follow Batak cultural ways, and today &quot;pure&quot; Batak are rare. They are also not reproducing to sustain their population. As a result, Batak are being absorbed into a more diffuse group of upland indigenous peoples who are slowing losing their tribal identities, and with it their unique spirituality and culture; there is even some debate as to whether or not they still exist as a distinct ethnic entity.

Batak families trace descent through both sides of the family. Kin relationships are similar to those of the Filipinos. Since the Batak are discouraged from using the birth name of their in-laws, they have multiple personal names. Divorce and remarriage used to be common and acceptable among the Batak but integration to mainstream Filipino society has changed this to a degree. Husbands and wives usually enjoy equal freedoms though the wives tend to live in their husband&#x27;s household except for the early stages of the marriage when both live in the wife&#x27;s household. Nuclear households are the basic economic unit though multiple households can and do pool their resources. However, the nuclear household is expected to be self-reliant. Batak households tend to have few children with the average being 3.5 persons.

== Subsistence ==
The Batak today engage in many occupations which includes foraging, selling forest derived goods, shifting cultivation, and workers under Filipino farmers or other employers. Primary food for the Batak were squirrels, jungle fowls, wild pigs, honey, fruits, yams, fish, mollusks, crustaceans and more. The main source for these food items come from the forests in the region. The Batak used many methods to capture animals like pigs with the use of bows and arrows, spears, dogs, or homemade guns which varied as time passed and foreign influence increased.

When it came to trading, the Batak mostly sold rattan, honey, and Manila copal. In return, they received clothing materials, rice, and other goods.

A few Batak also cultivate rice, corn, sweet potato, and cassava. Wage labor for nearby farmers is important to the Batak economy. Batak men are usually hired out for a few days to do certain work like clearing weeds, harvesting, or to pick coconuts and coffee. Local tourism is also a source of revenue for the Bataks.

<text>Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, formerly the Deer Park Metropolitan Women&#x27;s Correctional Centre (MWCC) is a maximum security women&#x27;s prison located at Deer Park, Victoria, Australia. Built in 1996, it was the first privately-owned prison in Victoria, but was transferred to public ownership in 2000 and is now run by Corrections Victoria. It also houses medium security and all protection prisoners.

==History==
Deer Park Metropolitan Women&#x27;s Correctional Centre (MWCC) was built in 1996 as the first privately designed, financed and operated prison in Victoria. The prison facility was opened on 15 August 1996 and received its first prisoners that same month, many of whom had been transferred from Fairlea Women&#x27;s Prison. The prison was the subject of intense scrutiny from its opening, as a result of incidents including self-harm and what the Victorian Corrections Commissioner described as &quot;a failure to have adequate suicide prevention protocols in place&quot;. Following four years of scandals, the Government reclaimed the prison from private ownership in 2000.

On 3 October 2000, the government took control of the facility and appointed an administrator under section 8F of the &quot;Corrections Act&quot;, and section 27B of the prison contract to operate the prison. On 2 November 2000, the Minister for Corrections announced the transfer of ownership and management of MWCC to the public sector. The centre was renamed after welfare worker and philanthropist Dame Phyllis Frost, who was well known for her commitment to unpopular causes, most notably helping women prisoners. As of 2008 it was Victoria&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s prison, holding 604 prisoners. As of June 2010 it accommodated 260 prisoners.

It is one of only two women&#x27;s prisons in Victoria, the other being HM Prison Tarrengower. As HM Prison Tarrengower is minimum security mainstream, all other female prisoners (medium security, maximum security, and all protection prisoners) are imprisoned at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre.

==Notable incidents==
In October 2003, male prison guard Kelvin McCann was charged with raping a mentally ill prisoner who was found to be pregnant when she was transferred to the Thomas Embling Hospital, a secured psychiatric hospital, and DNA tests revealed he was the father. The guard pleaded not guilty to the charges.

In December 2007, a Department of Justice and Regulation office filing cabinet which was being moved to new offices was mistakenly discarded at a second-hand furniture shop and bought by a Point Cook couple who discovered abandoned documents in the cabinet. After lengthy court action, documents from the filing cabinet were released and revealed allegations of corruption and sexual abuse at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre.

In November 2009, it was reported in the media that heroin and methamphetamine were &quot;readily available&quot; in the jail and that there had been a large increase in drug overdoses and suicide attempts among inmates at the prison. The acting operations manager was also accused of changing rosters so as to have sex with a female prison officer, including once at the jail.

In March 2018, the body of a male prison officer was found. His death was not being treated as suspicious.

In November 2021, an Indigenous woman held prisoner was transferred to Sunshine Hospital, where she later died.

<doc id="1335238" wikidata="Q2473861" url="?curid=1335238" title="Greater fool theory">
<text>In finance, the greater fool theory suggests that one can sometimes make money through speculation on overvalued items with a purchase price drastically exceeding the intrinsic valueif those assets can later be resold at an even higher price. 

In this context, one &quot;lesser fool&quot; might pay for an overpriced asset, hoping that they can sell it to an even &quot;greater fool&quot; and make a profit. This only works as long as there are enough new &quot;greater fools&quot; willing to pay higher and higher prices for the asset. Eventually, investors can no longer deny that the price is out of touch with reality, at which point a sell-off can cause the price to drop significantly until it is closer to its fair value, which in some cases could be zero. The last &quot;fools&quot; to purchase in on the product in question are then left holding the bag, allowing earlier, lesser fools to make off with the profit.

== Crowd psychology ==

Due to cognitive bias in human behavior, some people are drawn to assets whose price they see increasing, however irrational it might be. This effect is often further exacerbated by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. This effect was explained by economics professor Burton Malkiel in his book &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot;:

==Examples==

In real estate, the greater fool theory can drive investment through the expectation that prices always rise. A period of rising prices may cause lenders to underestimate the risk of default.

In the stock market, the greater fool theory applies when many investors make a questionable investment, with the assumption that they will be able to sell it later to &quot;a greater fool&quot;. In other words, they buy something not because they believe that it is worth the price, but rather because they believe that they will be able to sell it to someone else at an even higher price.

Art is another commodity in which speculation and privileged access drive prices, not intrinsic value. In November 2013, hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen of SAC Capital was selling at auction artworks that he had only recently acquired through private transactions. Works included paintings by Gerhard Richter and Rudolf Stingel and a sculpture by Cy Twombly. They were expected to sell for up to $80 million. In reporting the sale, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;Ever the trader, Mr. Cohen is also taking advantage of today’s active art market where new collectors will often pay far more for artworks than they are worth.&quot;

Cryptocurrencies have been characterized as examples of the greater fool theory. Numerous economists, including several Nobel laureates, have described cryptocurrency as having no intrinsic value whatsoever.

In contrast, in times of hyperinflation or in remote regions, the prices of necessities can be so exorbitant that relative to normal markets these prices may seem arbitrary. Yet the local cost of doing business relative to the price in these regions, as well as the necessity to feed and shelter oneself in a hyper-inflationary crisis, justifies through profit or actual benefit the &quot;foolish&quot; price. In these cases, there is no &quot;bubble&quot;, even though prices are very high.

==In popular culture==

The tenth and final episode of the first season of &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, written by Aaron Sorkin, is titled &quot;The Greater Fool,&quot; which is also the title of the diegetic cover story about Will McAvoy in a fictional edition of New York magazine that features in the episode: at one point, McAvoy is struck repeatedly with a copy.

Later in the episode, economist and fellow anchor Sloan Sabbith, in an attempt to console McAvoy about the unflattering article, explains the concept to him in an ironic light:

<text>Peoria and East Peoria, Illinois are separated by the Illinois River, a long body of water that reaches up to a mile across in places along Peoria Lake. The Illinois River is one of six rivers that are included in the Lower Illinois River Basin which extends between Ottawa, Illinois and the Mississippi River at Grafton, Illinois. Three of the six rivers in the Lower Illinois River Basin (Spoon River, Illinois River, and Mackinaw River) are in central Illinois. Their combined length is . Of these waterways the Illinois is thought to be the only river large enough to support barge traffic.

In the Peoria area, there are six bridges that cross the Illinois River. Because of the topography of the cities, alignments of the numerous state routes that cross the Illinois River can be somewhat confusing. However, these routes are generally well marked. All bridges that span the Illinois River are required to be built a minimum of above the average river level, as the Illinois River is the main route for river traffic between New Orleans and Chicago. The Illinois River is part of a waterway system that begins in New Orleans, Louisiana and exits the Atlantic Ocean via Chicago and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

<doc id="1335244" wikidata="Q1325887" url="?curid=1335244" title="Electric Dreams (film)">
<text>Electric Dreams is a 1984 science fiction romantic comedy film directed by Steve Barron (in his feature film directorial debut) and written by Rusty Lemorande. The film stars Lenny Von Dohlen, Virginia Madsen, Maxwell Caulfield, and the voice of Bud Cort.

&quot;Electric Dreams&quot; was released in the United States by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. on July 20, 1984, and in the United Kingdom by 20th Century Fox on August 17, 1984. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Miles Harding is an architect who envisions a brick shaped like a jigsaw puzzle piece that could enable buildings to withstand earthquakes. Seeking a way to get organized, he buys a personal computer to help him develop his ideas. Although he is initially unsure that he will even be able to correctly operate the computer, he later buys numerous extra gadgets that were not necessary for his work, such as switches to control household appliances like the blender, a speech synthesizer, and a microphone. The computer addresses Miles as &quot;Moles&quot;, because Miles had incorrectly typed his name during the initial set-up. When Miles attempts to download the entire database from a mainframe computer at work, his computer begins to overheat. In a state of panic, Miles uses a nearby bottle of champagne to douse the overheating machine, which then becomes sentient. Miles initially is unaware of the computer&#x27;s newfound sentience, but discovers it one night when he is awakened by the computer in the middle of the night when it mimics Miles talking in his sleep.

A love triangle soon develops among Miles, his computer (who later identifies himself as Edgar), and Miles&#x27;s neighbor, an attractive cellist named Madeline Robistat. Upon hearing her practicing Minuet in G major, BWV Anh. 114 from &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach&quot; on her cello through an air vent connecting both apartments, Edgar promptly elaborates a parallel variation of the piece, leading to an improvised duet. Believing it was Miles who had engaged her in the duet, Madeline begins to fall in love with him though she has an ongoing relationship with fellow musician Bill.

At Miles&#x27;s request, Edgar composes a piece of music for Madeline. When their mutual love becomes evident, however, Edgar responds with jealousy upon not receiving credit for creating these songs, cancelling Miles&#x27;s credit cards and registering him as an &quot;armed and dangerous&quot; criminal. Upon discovering this humiliation, Miles and Edgar have a confrontation, where Miles shoves the computer and tries to unplug it, getting an electric shock. Then, the computer retaliates by harassing him with an improvised maze of remotely controlled household electronics, in the style of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;.

Eventually, Edgar accepts Madeline and Miles&#x27;s love for each other, and appears to commit suicide by sending a large electric current out through his acoustic coupler modem, around the world, and finally reaching back to himself just after he and Miles make amends.

Later, as Madeline and Miles go on vacation together, Edgar&#x27;s voice is heard on the radio dedicating a song to &quot;the ones I love&quot;, titled &quot;Together in Electric Dreams&quot;. The credits are interspersed with scenes of the song being heard all over California, including a radio station trying to shut it off, declaring that they do not know where the signal is coming from.

==Cast==
* Lenny Von Dohlen as Miles Harding
* Virginia Madsen as Madeline Robistat
* Maxwell Caulfield as Bill
* Bud Cort as the voice of Edgar
* Don Fellows as Mr. Ryley
* Giorgio Moroder as Record Producer 
* Miriam Margolyes as Ticket Girl
* Koo Stark as Girl in Soap Opera

==Production==
Steve Barron had made more than 100 music videos and routinely sent them to his mother for comment. She particularly liked one he did for Haysi Fantayzee. She was doing continuity on &quot;Yentl,&quot; co-produced by Rusty Lemorande and Larry deWaay, and she showed it to them. Lemorande had finished his own script for &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; and was looking for a director, so he offered Barron the job.

Barron took the script to Virgin Films, and it agreed to finance within four days. The film was presold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who held rights for the U.S., Canada, Japan and South East Asia. Two months after Virgin agreed to make the movie, filming began in San Francisco on October 11, 1983.

Virginia Madsen later recalled she &quot;was very spoiled on that movie, because it was such a lovefest that I now believe that every movie should be like that... I had a mad, crazy crush on Lenny Von Dohlen. God, we were so... we were head-over-heels for each other. Nothing happened, and at this point, I admit it: I wanted it to happen... He&#x27;s still one of my best friends.&quot;

Bud Cort provided the voice of the computer. The director did not want Cort to be seen by the other actors during scenes so Cort had to do his lines in a padded box on a sound stage. He said, &quot;It got a little lonely in there, I must admit. I kept waiting to meet the other actors, but nobody came to say hello.&quot; Boy George visited the set and, being a fan of &quot;Harold and Maude,&quot; got Cort&#x27;s autograph.

The computer hardware company&#x27;s name in the film is &quot;Pinecone,&quot; a play on Apple Computer.

Fans of &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; have noted the similarities between the film and Spike Jonze&#x27;s &quot;Her.&quot; When asked about it, Jonze claimed to have never seen the former film. 

In 2009, Barron said that Madsen told him she was planning on being involved in a remake. He said, &quot;She didn&#x27;t ask me to do it, so I guess I blew my chance on the first one! I wouldn&#x27;t actually do it, but it would have been nice for the ego to be asked.&quot;

==Music==

The soundtrack features music from prominent popular musicians of the time, being among the movies of this generation that actively explored the commercial link between a movie and its soundtrack. The soundtrack album &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; was re-issued on CD in 1998. The movie features music from Giorgio Moroder, Culture Club, Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra), and Heaven 17. During filming, Barron said, &quot;The fact that there&#x27;s so much music has to do with the success of &quot;Flashdance.&quot; This film isn&#x27;t &quot;Flashdance 2.&quot; &quot;Flashdance&quot; worked because of the dancing. It didn&#x27;t have a story. &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; does.&quot;

The film also features the song &quot;Together in Electric Dreams.&quot; Barron has said about its creation:
He has also said about the film&#x27;s music: &quot;&quot;Electric Dreams&quot; was definitely an attempt to try and weave the early 1980s music video genre into a movie... [The film] isn&#x27;t that deep. The closest parallel is probably that it&#x27;s a Cyrano de Bergerac-like exploration of how words and music can help nurture and grow feelings on the path to love. Oops that&#x27;s too deep.&quot; In 2015, he said when he made the film there was a prejudice against video clip directors doing drama, and because &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; &quot;was a little bit like an extended music video... I didn&#x27;t help that cause in a lot of ways.&quot;

==Release==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 20 reviews.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the film failed to &quot;blend and balance its ingredients properly,&quot; and that it lost plot elements and taxed credibility.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;inspired and appealing... a romantic comedy of genuine sweetness and originality.&quot;

Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert each gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, with Siskel writing that it showed a new director eager to show off his talents and Ebert writing &quot;One of the nicest things about the movie is the way it maintains its note of slightly bewildered innocence.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Electric Dreams&quot; was released on VHS in 1984 and in 1991 in the US by MGM/UA Home Video, who released a LaserDisc in America in 1985. Warner Home Video released a Video CD version for the Singapore market in 2001. The film received a Region 2 DVD release on April 6, 2009, by MGM. UK video label Second Sight released a Blu-ray on August 7, 2017, making its worldwide debut on Blu-ray.

Currently, MGM owns international rights to film due to the Virgin/M.E.C.G film catalog they gained in the mid-90s thru their acquisition of the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library. However, MGM does not own the film outright anymore (despite having distributed the film in the US initially) as Shout! Studios now owns rights to the film in the US, putting the film up on VOD in April 2022, marking its digital debut. 
Additionally, it is also one of the few MGM titles from the pre-May 1986 MGM/UA library that are not owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (thru Turner Entertainment Co.) due to Virgin Pictures’ co-production of the film.

<doc id="1335246" wikidata="Q1278789" url="?curid=1335246" title="John Fitzalan (died 1240)">
<text>John Fitzalan, 3rd Lord of Clun and Oswestry (1200–1240) was a Norman nobleman in the Welsh Marches in the county of Shropshire.

==Family==
John succeeded his brother, William Fitz Alan, 2nd Lord of Oswestry and Clun, who died in 1215 without issue. They were sons of William Fitz Alan, 1st Lord of Oswestry and Clun (died c. 1210) and a daughter of Hugh de Lacy, name unknown; The FitzAlans were descendants of Alan fitzFlaad, a Breton.

==Royal conflicts==
He was one of the feudal barons who became a target for the anger of King John of England, whose forces attacked Oswestry town and burned it in 1216. John FitzAlan was close to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth until 1217.

He was also a representative of the Crown in a dispute between King Henry III of England and the Welsh leader, Llywelyn the Great in 1226. In the same year he mediated between a neighbour, William Pantulf (died 1233), Lord of Wem in Shropshire and Madog ap Gruffydd (died 1236), Lord of Powys and a cousin to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth.

In 1233/4 during the conflict between King Henry III, the Earl Marshal, and Llywelyn the Great, John FitzAlan sided firmly with the Crown and Oswestry was again attacked, this time by Welsh forces.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Isabel d&#x27;Aubigny, daughter of William d&#x27;Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel and Mabel of Chester, and they were parents of:

*John Fitzalan, Lord of Clun &amp; Oswestry, and Arundel, whose grandson became Earl of Arundel.

<text>Fourth Reading was a weekly current events newsmagazine series in Canada, airing on TVOntario from 1992 to 2006. 

== History ==
It was hosted by Steve Paikin. Its name derived from the parliamentary convention that a bill receives three readings in a legislative house before becoming law; media coverage would therefore constitute a &quot;fourth reading&quot;.

The show covered provincial politics in Ontario, and national political issues affecting the province, through news reportage, interviews and panel discussions.

The show premiered in 1992, soon after Paikin joined the network as host of its flagship news series &quot;Between the Lines&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Between the Lines&quot; was replaced with &quot;Studio 2&quot;, although &quot;Fourth Reading&quot; continued to air; however, when &quot;Studio 2&quot; was replaced with &quot;The Agenda&quot; in 2006, &quot;Fourth Reading&quot; ceased to air as a standalone program, and was subsumed into &quot;The Agenda&quot; as a weekly panel segment.

<doc id="1335268" wikidata="Q232129" url="?curid=1335268" title="American badger">
<text>The American badger (Taxidea taxus) is a North American badger similar in appearance to the European badger, although not closely related. It is found in the western, central, and northeastern United States, northern Mexico, and south-central Canada to certain areas of southwestern British Columbia.

The American badger&#x27;s habitat is typified by open grasslands with available prey (such as mice, squirrels, and groundhogs). The species prefers areas such as prairie regions with sandy loam soils where it can dig more easily for its prey.

==Taxonomy==
The American badger is a member of the Mustelidae, a diverse family of carnivorous mammals that also includes weasels, otters, ferrets, and the wolverine. The American badger belongs to the Taxidiinae, one of four subfamilies of mustelid badgers – the other three being the Melinae (four species in two genera, including the European badger), the Helictidinae (five species of ferret-badgers) and the Mellivorinae (the honey badger); the so-called stink badgers are mephitids. The American badger&#x27;s closest relative is the prehistoric &quot;Chamitataxus&quot;. Among extant mustelids, the American badger is the most basal species; its lineage is thought to have split off from the rest of the Mustelidae about 18 million years (Ma) ago, following the split of mustelids from procyonids about 29 Ma ago.

The recognized subspecies include:
The ranges of the subspecies overlap considerably, with intermediate forms occurring in the areas of overlap.

In Mexico, this animal is sometimes called &quot;tlalcoyote&quot;. The Spanish word for badger is &quot;tejón&quot;, but in Mexico this word is also used to describe the coati. This can lead to confusion, as both coatis and badgers are found in Mexico.

==Description==
The American badger has most of the general characteristics common to badgers; with stocky and low-slung bodies with short, powerful legs, they are identifiable by their huge foreclaws (measuring up to 5 cm in length) and distinctive head markings.

American badgers possess morphological characteristics that enable them to be good fossorial specialists, such as a conical head, bristles on the ears, and nictitating membranes in the eyes. American badgers have powerful forelimbs. They also possess a strong humerus and large bony processes for the attachment of muscles. The mechanical advantage in badger forelimbs is increased by the specialized olecranon process and bones such as the radius and metacarpals.

Measuring generally between in length, males of the species are slightly larger than females. They may attain an average weight of roughly for females and up to for males. Northern subspecies such as &quot;T. t. jeffersonii&quot; are heavier than the southern subspecies. In the fall, when food is plentiful, adult male badgers can reach up to . In some northern populations, females can average .
Except for the head, the American badger is covered with a grizzled, brown, black and white coat of coarse hair or fur, giving almost a mixed brown-tan appearance. The coat aids in camouflage in grassland habitat. Its triangular face shows a distinctive black and white pattern, with brown or blackish &quot;badges&quot; marking the cheeks and a white stripe extending from the nose to the base of the head. In the subspecies &quot;T. t. berlandieri&quot;, the white head stripe extends the full length of the body, to the base of the tail.

==Diet==

The American badger is a fossorial carnivore. It preys predominantly on pocket gophers (Geomyidae), ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus&quot;), moles (Talpidae), marmots (&quot;Marmota&quot;), prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys&quot;), pika (&quot;Ochotona&quot;), woodrats (&quot;Neotoma&quot;), kangaroo rats (&quot;Dipodomys&quot;), deer mice (&quot;Peromyscus&quot;), and voles (&quot;Microtus&quot;), often digging to pursue prey into their dens, and sometimes plugging tunnel entrances with objects. The American badger is a significant predator of snakes, including rattlesnakes, and is considered their most important predator in South Dakota. They also prey on ground-nesting birds, such as the bank swallow, or sand martin (&quot;Riparia riparia&quot;), and the burrowing owl (&quot;Athene cunicularia&quot;), lizards, amphibians, carrion, fish, skunks (&quot;Mephitis&quot; and &quot;Spilogale&quot;), insects (including bees and honeycomb), and some plant foods, such as corn (&quot;Zea mais&quot;), peas, green beans, mushrooms and other fungi, and sunflower seeds (&quot;Helianthus&quot;).

==Behavior==
American badgers are generally nocturnal; however, in remote areas with no human encroachment they are routinely observed foraging during the day. Seasonally, a badger observed during daylight hours in the spring months of late March to early May often represents a female foraging during daylight and spending nights with her young. Badgers do not hibernate but may become less active in winter. A badger may spend much of the winter in cycles of torpor that last around 29 hours. They do emerge from their burrows when the temperature is above freezing.

As a fossorial mammal, the American badger uses a scratch-digging process where the forelimbs are withdrawn to break the soil and move the debris behind or to the sides of its body 

An abandoned badger burrow may be occupied by mammals of similar size, such as foxes and skunks, as well as animals as diverse as the burrowing owl, tiger salamander and California red-legged frog.

The American badger has been seen working with a coyote in tandem while hunting. Typically this pairing is one badger to one coyote; however, one study found about 9% of sightings included two coyotes to one badger, while 1% had one badger to three coyotes. Researchers have found that the coyote benefits by an increased catch rate of about 33%, and while it is difficult to see precisely how the badger benefits, the badger has been noted to spend more time underground and active. Badgers are also thought to expend less energy while hunting in burrows.

According to research, this partnership works due to the different hunting styles of the predators and how their prey reacts to them. A ground squirrel, upon spotting a coyote, will crawl into its hole to escape; while upon seeing a badger, the ground squirrel will climb out of its hole and use its speed to outrun the badger. Hunting in tandem raises the prey vulnerability and both predators win.

==Life cycle==
Badgers are normally solitary animals but are thought to expand their territories in the breeding season to seek out mates. Mating occurs in late summer and early fall, with some males breeding with more than one female. American badgers experience delayed implantation, with pregnancies suspended until December or as late as February. Young are born from late March to early April in litters ranging from one to five young, averaging about three.

Badgers are born blind, furred, and helpless. Eyes open at four to six weeks. The female feeds her young solid foods prior to complete weaning and for a few weeks thereafter. Young American badgers first emerge from the den on their own at five to six weeks old. Families usually break up and juveniles disperse from the end of June to August; young American badgers leave their mothers as early as late May or June. Juvenile dispersal movements are erratic.
Most female American badgers become pregnant for the first time after they are a year old. A minority of females four to five months old ovulate, and a few become pregnant. Males usually do not breed until their second year.

Large predators occasionally kill American badgers. The average longevity in the wild is 9–10 years, with a record of 14; a captive example lived at least 15 years and five months.

==Habitat==
American badgers prefer grasslands and open areas with grasslands, which can include parklands, farms, and treeless areas with friable soil and a supply of rodent prey. They may also be found in forest glades and meadows, marshes, brushy areas, hot deserts, and mountain meadows. They are sometimes found at elevations up to but are usually found in the Sonoran and Transition life zones (which are at elevations lower and warmer than those characterized by coniferous forests). In Arizona, they occur in desert scrub and semi-arid grasslands. In California, American badgers are primarily able to survive through a combination of open grasslands of agricultural lands, protected land trust and open space lands, and regional and state and national park lands with grassland habitat. Badgers are occasionally found in open chaparral (with less than 50% plant cover) and riparian zones. They are not usually found in mature chaparral. In Manitoba aspen parklands, American badger abundance was positively associated with the abundance of Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus richardsonii&quot;).
In Ontario it primarily resides on the extreme southwestern portion of the province, restricted to the north shore of Lake Erie in open areas generally associated with agriculture and along woodland edges. There have been a few reports from the Bruce-Grey region.

American badger use of home range varies with season and sex. Different areas of the home range are used more frequently at different seasons and usually are related to prey availability. Males generally have larger home ranges than females. In a 1972 study, radiotransmitter-tagged American badgers had an average annual home range of . The home range of one female was in summer, in fall, and in winter. Lindzey reported average home ranges of . Estimated density of American badgers in Utah scrub-steppe was one per square mile (2.6 km2), with 10 dens in active or recent use.

, overdevelopment of American badger habitat had resulted in reduced range, decreased prey, and forced badgers into contact with humans when foraging between fragments. Direct observations in Sonoma County, documenting habitat and badger sightings and foraging, reflect various ranges within the fragmented habitat areas from less than 1/2 mile to approximately 4 miles. Within these areas, the availability of prey and a fresh water source are key factors for the preferred habitat areas and ability to survive. Identifying and conserving habitat areas where there is year-round activity, along with identified burrowing patterns and observations of female badger territory for birthing and raising young have become critical factors in survival of the species.

===Plant communities===
American badgers are most commonly found in treeless areas, including tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, grass-dominated meadows and fields within forested habitats, and shrub-steppe communities. In the Southwest, plant indicators of the Sonoran and Transition life zones (relatively low, dry elevations) commonly associated with American badgers include creosotebush
(&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;), junipers (&quot;Juniperus&quot; spp.), gambel oak (&quot;Quercus gambelii&quot;), willows (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), cottonwoods (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.), ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), grasses, and sagebrushes (&quot;Artemisia&quot; spp.).

In Colorado in 1977, American badgers were common in grass–forb and ponderosa pine habitats. In Kansas, they are common in tallgrass prairie dominated by big bluestem (&quot;Andropogon gerardi&quot;), little bluestem (&quot;Schizachyrium scoparium&quot;), and Indian grass (&quot;Sorghastrum nutans&quot;). In Montana in 1990, badgers were present in Glacier National Park in fescue (&quot;Festuca&quot; spp.) grasslands. In Manitoba, they occur in grassland extensions within aspen (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.) parklands.

===Cover requirements===
American badgers require cover for sleep, concealment, protection from weather, and natal denning. They typically enlarge foraged out gopher or other prey holes, or other animal burrows. Their dens range from about 4 feet to 10 feet in depth and 4 feet to 6 feet in width. A female American Badger may create 2 to 4 burrows in proximity with a connecting tunnel for concealment and safety for her young. Displaced soil from digging out the burrow characteristically appears in front of the burrow entrance, and a view from a distance reveals a mound-like roof of the burrow, with the living and concealment space created underneath the raised-roof appearing mound.

During summer and autumn, badgers range more frequently, with mating season generally in November, and burrowing patterns reflect 1 to 3 burrows may be dug from foraged out prey holes in a day, used for a day to a week, and then abandoned, with possible returns later, and other small wildlife utilizing abandoned burrows in the interim. Where prey is particularly plentiful, they will reuse dens, especially in the fall, sometimes for a few days at a time. In winter, a single den may be used for most of the season. Natal dens are dug by the female and are used for extended periods, but litters may be moved, probably to allow the mother to forage in new areas close to the nursery. Natal dens are usually larger and more complex than diurnal dens.

==Predation==
While the American badger is an aggressive animal with few natural enemies, it is still vulnerable to other species in its habitat. Predation on juvenile specimens by golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) and bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) has been reported. Bears (&quot;Ursus&quot; spp.) and gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) occasionally kill adult American badgers, while cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), according to a 2019 study, apparently are the main predators of adults, hunting them much more frequently than the other carnivorans, with a documented case where the badger is one of the main prey of a radio-collared cougar.

American badgers are trapped by humans for their pelts. Their fur is used for shaving and painting brushes.

==Conservation status==
In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed each of the subspecies &quot;Taxidea taxus jacksoni&quot; and &quot;T. t. jeffersonii&quot; as an endangered species in Canada. The nominate subspecies was additionally deemed to be of &quot;Special Concern&quot; in November 2012. The subspecies &quot;T. t. jeffersonii&quot;, which resides in British Columbia, was subsequently divided into two populations, a western one in the Okanagan Valley-Cariboo region and an eastern one in East Kootenay, with each receiving an endangered listing. The Canadian population of &quot;T. t. jacksoni&quot; is isolated from other badgers in a small area of southwestern Ontario near the border with the United States south of the Niagara Peninsula, although a population may also exist in the northwest of the province.

The California Department of Fish and Game designated the American badger as a California species of special concern.

<text>A swimming cap, swim cap or bathing cap, is a tightly fitted, skin-tight garment, commonly made from silicone, latex or lycra, worn on the head by recreational and competitive swimmers.

Swim caps are worn for various reasons: they can be worn to keep hair out of the swimmer&#x27;s face, reduce drag, protect hair from chlorine or sun damage, keep hair dry, keep the head warm, or (sometimes in combination with earplugs) to keep water out of the ears. Caps can also be worn to identify skill level in swimming lessons.

==History==

Swim caps were made of rubberized fabric during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, they were made of latex. The earliest chin strap caps were known as &quot;aviator&#x27;s style caps&quot; as they resembled the strapped leather helmets of flyers of the day. During the 1940s, swim caps became scarce as rubber was needed for war materials. The permanent wave hairstyle took time to obtain and was expensive, so many women wanted to protect their hair while swimming. The 1950s saw decorated caps come into vogue, and during the 1960s, colorful flower petal swim caps became popular. Men&#x27;s long hair styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s gave rise to increased use of swim caps. Without swim cap requirements, wearing swim caps fell out of fashion during the 1970s. Swim caps are available in different styles: the traditional chin strap type with inner sealing to keep out water and colorful floral styles reminiscent of the 1960s as well as other graphic prints.

Recently, Toks Ahmed and Michael Chapman created a swim cap specifically designed for dreadlocks, hair weaves or extensions, and voluminous hair. They named it the Soul Cap, but it was banned at the 2020 Summer Olympics because of its size and configuration. On 2 September 2022, FINA approved the special cap&#x27;s use for all future competitions.

==Double capping==
Many swimmers have trouble finding a swim cap that keeps their hair dry. &quot;Double capping&quot;—wearing two swim caps—can provide a tighter swim cap seal. An inner silicone or latex swim cap pulled low over the ears worn under a second traditional style chin strap swim cap with an inner seal may provide the protection desired. &quot;Double capping&quot; is also used by participants of open water swimming to provide warmth.

In order to make as smooth a surface as possible for maximum streamlining, sometimes an inner latex cap is put on, followed by swim goggles over the latex cap, and then second snug silicone swim cap is fitted over both.

== English Channel swimming rules ==
The English &quot;Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation&quot; and the &quot;Channel Swimming Association&quot; state that &quot;one standard swim cap&quot; may be used for official English Channel record swims. The cap must be approved by the official observer who accompanies the swimmer on the pilot boat across the channel. &quot;Standard swim caps&quot; that have been used by English Channel swimmers of record over the years include solid rubber &quot;tank&quot; style swim caps, molded rubber swim caps with chin strap, bubble crepe rubber swim caps with chin strap, silicone swim caps and latex &quot;racing&quot; swim caps. Swim caps that have neoprene within the cap construction such as the &quot;Barracuda Hothead&quot;, or that are completely made of neoprene are not allowed for record English Channel swims. Several other long distance swims such as the Santa Catalina Channel California swim have similar rules for record swims. Swim caps worn for open water swims should be of visible colors that contrast with the water so that observers may safely monitor them, and operators of vessels may see them.

<doc id="1335273" wikidata="Q796774" url="?curid=1335273" title="BMW Z1">
<text>The BMW Z1 is the first model in BMW&#x27;s line of Z series roadsters (two-seater convertibles), and was produced in limited numbers from 1989 to 1991.

The Z1 is unique for its plastic body panels and vertically sliding doors which drop into the door sills. It is one of the first BMWs to use a multi-link rear suspension. The sole drivetrain specification is the 2.5-litre straight-six engine and 5-speed manual transmission from the E30 325i.

In 1995, the Z1&#x27;s successor, the mass-produced Z3, began production.

== Development and launch ==
At the start of 1985, BMW set up a division called BMW Technik GmbH to develop concepts for new vehicles and technologies. The director of BMW Technik GmbH was Ulrich Bez, who oversaw the Z1&#x27;s development. Control of the project was turned over to Klaus Faust when Bez left BMW in October 1988. The lead designer was Harm Lagaay.

In August 1985, the BMW board gave approval to further develop the BMW Technik&#x27;s first concept vehicle, the Z1. A year later, the first road-going prototype was produced and BMW publicly revealed the project. A coupe model was also the subject of a design study, but it did not reach production.

In August 1987, BMW announced that the Z1 would enter production and the following month the production form of the Z1 was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Production began in October 1988. The original price target was DM 80,000, however by the time production began, the base price had increased to DM 83,000.

== Doors ==
The doors are unique in that they retract vertically, instead of traditional designs which swing outward or upward (the first car with retractable doors was the 1954 Kaiser Darrin, although those Kaiser Darrin doors slid forwards not downwards). The body with its high sills, offers crash protection independent of the doors, and it is possible (although perhaps not legal in some countries) for the Z1 to be driven with the doors lowered.

The windows may be operated independently of the doors, although they do retract automatically if the door is lowered. Both the window and door are driven by electric motors through toothed rubber belts and may be moved manually in an emergency.

== Body ==
In addition to the unique door design, the Z1 body featured several other innovations: removable plastic body panels, a flat undertray, a roll-hoop integrated into the windscreen surround and continuously zinc welded seams.

The side panels and doors are made of GE&#x27;s Xenoy thermoplastic. The bonnet, boot, and roof cover are GRP components made by Seger + Hoffman AG. The car is painted in a special flexible lacquer finish developed jointly by AKZO Coatings and BMW Technik GmbH. During the Z1s launch, BMW suggested that owners purchase an additional set of body panels and change the color of the car from time to time. The car could actually be driven with all of the panels completely removed, similar to the Pontiac Fiero. BMW noted that the body could be completely replaced in 40 minutes, although Z1 owners have reported that this may be highly optimistic.

Aerodynamics were a focus of the vehicle design. The flat plastic undertray is used for ground effect aerodynamics and the rear bumper - in conjunction with the aerodynamically shaped muffler - forms a diffuser to reduce rear lift. The front end reportedly induces a high-pressure zone just forward of the front wheels to increase front-wheel traction. The Z1 has a drag coefficient of 0.36 Cd with the top up or 0.43 Cd with it down.

== Suspension ==
The rear suspension, called the Z Axle, was specially designed for the Z1. It was one of the first BMWs to feature a multi-link design. In the 1990s, the Z Axle would be used on a variety of BMW Group vehicles, including the E36 3 Series and the R40 Rover 75.

Front suspension is as per the E30 325i. Wheels, similar to the E30 325i, are by wheels on both the front and rear, equipped with 205/55VR-15 tires.

== Drivetrain ==
The sole drivetrain configuration is a 2.5 Litre M20 straight-six engine and five-speed Getrag 260/5 manual transmission, sourced from the E30 325i. The engine is a SOHC straight-six engine, which produces at 5,800 rpm and of torque.

The engine sits tilted 20 degrees to the right, to accommodate the low hoodline.

== Z Series ==

The &quot;Z&quot; in Z1 originally stood for , the German word for &quot;future&quot;. Later cars in the Z Series are the Z3, Z4, and Z8, which were all available as 2-seat convertibles (however some models were also available as 2-seat coupes).

== Production ==

The Z1 was produced from March 1989 to June 1991, all at BMW&#x27;s plant in Munich, Exactly 8,000 cars were produced. All the cars were left-hand drive, and the majority (6,443) were sold in BMW&#x27;s native German market. The country to receive the second-greatest number of Z1s, Italy, received less than 7% of the total sold domestically. BMW Z1 vehicles officially imported to France for sale there have yellow headlights instead of the clear ones found elsewhere.

Initial demand was strong, with BMW receiving orders for 3,500 vehicles before production began. However, demand dropped significantly around 1988 and BMW ended production in 1991. There is speculation that the drop in demand was due to the early inflated demand from speculative investors. In 1988, however, BMW was quoted as saying that they had 35,000 orders for the Z1.

BMW was reportedly unable to build more than 10 to 20 Z1 vehicles each day. More than half of all Z1 vehicles (specifically, 4,091) were produced for the 1990 model year. Seventy-eight Z1 vehicles were reportedly used as test mules, although most were later sold without a warranty and, presumably, at a lower price.

The Z1 was available in six exterior colours and four interior colours. Red is the most common exterior color. Most (6,177) were red, black, or green with a dark grey interior. Light yellow exterior (&quot;fun-gelb&quot; in German or &quot;fun yellow&quot; in English; 133 examples made) or red interior (38 examples made) are the rarest Z1 colours. The colours &quot;swimming pool blue&quot; and &quot;oh-so-orange&quot; were reserved for the car&#x27;s designers, Ulrich Bez and Harm Lagaay.

<text>Jorma Ludwik Kaukonen Jr. (; ; born December 23, 1940) is an American blues, folk, and rock guitarist. Kaukonen performed with Jefferson Airplane, and still performs regularly on tour with Hot Tuna, which started as a side project with bassist Jack Casady, and as of early 2024 has continued for 55 years. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him No. 54 on its list of 100 Greatest Guitarists. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a member of Jefferson Airplane.

==Biography==
Jorma Kaukonen was born in Washington, D.C. to Beatrice Love (née Levine) and Jorma Ludwik Kaukonen Sr. He had Finnish paternal grandparents and Russian Jewish ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side. He is the older brother of fellow musician Peter Kaukonen. During his childhood, the Kaukonen family lived in Pakistan, the Philippines, and other locales as they followed his father&#x27;s State Department career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. In Pakistan he attended Karachi Grammar School. As a teenager in Washington, he and friend Jack Casady formed a band called the Triumphs, with Kaukonen on rhythm guitar and Casady on lead.

Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College, Ohio, where his friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen&#x27;s repertoire throughout his career.

In 1962, Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and enrolled at the University of Santa Clara. During this time, he gave guitar lessons at Benner Music Company in San Jose. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and accompanied Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on the 1964 recording known as &quot;The Typewriter Tapes&quot; because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen&#x27;s first wife, Margareta, typing in the background.

===Jefferson Airplane===

In 1965, a friend Bob Kinzie introduced Kaukonen to a former Santa Clara student, Paul Kantner, who invited Kaukonen to join a band he was forming with Marty Balin. As a self-described country blues purist, Kaukonen was initially reluctant, but found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar, later remarking that he was &quot;sucked in&quot; by technology. With the group still looking for a name, Kaukonen suggested the name Jefferson Airplane, inspired by an eccentric friend who had given his dog the name &quot;Blind Lemon Jefferson Airplane.&quot; When their original bass player was fired, Kaukonen recommended his friend Casady (who still lived in Washington at the time) as a replacement.

Though never a prolific singer or songwriter during his tenure with Jefferson Airplane, Kaukonen contributed notable material to each of the group&#x27;s albums, including the instrumental &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;; arrangements of the traditional &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; and B.B. King&#x27;s &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;; &quot;Third Week in the Chelsea,&quot; which detailed his feelings about the disintegration of the band; and &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;—all of which he continues to play.

===Hot Tuna===
In 1969–70, Kaukonen and Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spinoff group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Jefferson Airplane vocalist Marty Balin, Kaukonen&#x27;s brother Peter on rhythm guitar, and Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping (which came to include guitarist Paul Ziegler after the younger Kaukonen&#x27;s departure) came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt in Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. A concurrent semi-acoustic configuration (including Kaukonen, Casady on electric bass and harmonica player Will Scarlett) enabled the guitarist to show off his Piedmont-style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The group&#x27;s self-titled first album was a September 1969 live recording of this ensemble. Amid the gradual dissolution of Jefferson Airplane from 1971 to 1973, Hot Tuna went electric in earnest, with fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM radio hit with &quot;Ja Da (Keep on Truckin&#x27;)&quot; from their third (and first studio) album, &quot;Burgers&quot;. At this time, Kaukonen&#x27;s songwriting began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, &quot;The Phosphorescent Rat&quot;, which featured only one cover song.

Beginning with their fifth album, &quot;America&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality—a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasimystical lyrics by Kaukonen. During this period, the trio was known for their very long live sets and instrumental jamming. Hot Tuna toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna&#x27;s break up in 1978, the first phase of the band&#x27;s career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band SVT, while Kaukonen played as a solo act at venues that had been booked for Hot Tuna&#x27;s cancelled 1978 tour.

===Solo===
Kaukonen had begun his solo career several years prior to the breakup, when he recorded the 1974 album &quot;Quah&quot;; produced by Jack Casady, &quot;Quah&quot; featured string overdubs on some tracks, as well as several tracks written and sung by Kaukonen&#x27;s friend Tom Hobson. The opening track &quot;Genesis&quot; was featured in the films &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot; (2007) and &quot;Transcendence&quot; (2014).

In 1979, Kaukonen released his second solo album, &quot;Jorma&quot;. Later that year, he began touring with a number of bass/drum combinations (first known as &quot;Hidden Klitz&quot;, then as &quot;White Gland&quot;, and finally as &quot;Vital Parts&quot;), which initially included Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. During this time, he experimented with a new image, with short, dyed hair and extensive tattoos adorning his body, back, and arms. He recorded the album &quot;Barbeque King&quot;, which was released in 1980. Kaukonen&#x27;s traditional fan base did not warm to this new &quot;punk&quot; image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that he was soon dropped from RCA Records.

He continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey, and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two-hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums.

In 1984, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Amagamalin Street&quot;. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label founded by Les Kippel that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released &quot;Splashdown&quot;, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a now-defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records remained Hot Tuna&#x27;s record label until 2000, and also released &quot;Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic&quot;, &quot;Classic Hot Tuna Electric&quot;, &quot;Live at Sweetwater&quot;, and &quot;Live at Sweetwater Two&quot;.

In 1985, Kaukonen performed with the band There Goes the Neighborhood with Jaco Pastorius (bass), Doug McClean (harmonica), Whitie Melvin (percussion), Ben Prevo (guitar), and Rashied Ali (congas).

Having briefly reformed for a tour in 1983 that closed with a farewell show at Jonathan Swift&#x27;s in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Hot Tuna again reformed in 1986.

At a 1988 Hot Tuna performance at The Fillmore, Kaukonen surprised fellow Jefferson Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner (who was sitting in with the band) with an appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick. The success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989.

In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;. The resulting tracks were released as &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;, the album, in 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour. His 2002 album &quot;Blue Country Heart&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award.

With his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy, complete with a 32-track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records, and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhoff as Hot Tuna.

On August 28, 2018, St. Martin&#x27;s Press published Kaukonen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Been So Long: My Life and Music&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kaukonen married his first wife, Lena &quot;Margareta&quot; Pettersson (September 23, 1943 – December 28, 1997), in January 1964. They divorced in 1983. He met his second wife, Vanessa, in Key West, Florida, on July 3, 1988; they married on December 7 of that year. Kaukonen has a son, Zachary (born September 6, 1997), whose mother was Stephanie Kearse, and an adopted daughter, Izze.

==Equipment==
As a member of Jefferson Airplane, Kaukonen&#x27;s primary guitar was a Gibson ES-345, noted for the visible Varitone dial on the guitar and the signature 345 logo on the headstock. Kaukonen presently endorses Martin Guitars. In 2010, Martin Guitars released the Martin M-30 Jorma Kaukonen Custom Artist Edition. This guitar was designed by Kaukonen and Martin&#x27;s Dick Boak, using ideas from two Martin guitars that he had previously been playing – a David Bromberg Custom Artist Edition and a prototype model that Kaukonen called an &quot;M-5.&quot;

Epiphone released a Jorma Kaukonen signature model Riviera guitar in 2002. Kaukonen also uses and endorses the Fishman Loudbox amp. Jorma currently plays Flammang Acoustic Guitars, build by Luthier David Flammang in Iowa.
