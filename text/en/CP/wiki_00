<text>A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS). Originally developed as instruments for the corporate debt markets, after 2002 CDOs became vehicles for refinancing mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Like other private label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns. Distinctively, CDO credit risk is typically assessed based on a probability of default (PD) derived from ratings on those bonds or assets.

The CDO is &quot;sliced&quot; into sections known as &quot;tranches&quot;, which &quot;catch&quot; the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority. If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most &quot;junior&quot; tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, coupon payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk. As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as &quot;super senior&quot;); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.

Separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration, known as &quot;CDO-Squared&quot;, &quot;CDOs of CDOs&quot; or &quot;synthetic CDOs&quot;.

In the early 2000s, the debt underpinning CDOs was generally diversified, but by 2006–2007—when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this had changed. CDO collateral became dominated by high risk (BBB or A) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually subprime mortgages. These CDOs have been called &quot;the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain&quot; for subprime mortgages, and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make subprime loans, leading to the 2007–2009 subprime mortgage crisis.

==Market history==

===Beginnings===

In 1970, the US government-backed mortgage guarantor Ginnie Mae created the first MBS (mortgage-backed security), based on FHA and VA mortgages. It guaranteed these MBSs. This would be the precursor to CDOs that would be created two decades later. In 1971, Freddie Mac issued its first Mortgage Participation Certificate. This was the first mortgage-backed security made of ordinary mortgages. All through the 1970s, private companies began mortgage asset securitization by creating private mortgage pools.

In 1974, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the United States imposed heavy sanctions for financial institutions found guilty of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age This led to a more open policy of giving loans (sometimes subprime) by banks, guaranteed in most cases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act was enacted to address historical discrimination in lending, such as &#x27;redlining&#x27;. The Act encouraged commercial banks and savings associations (Savings and loan banks) to meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods (who might earlier have been thought of as too risky for home loans).

In 1977, the investment bank Salomon Brothers created a &quot;private label&quot; MBS (mortgage backed security)—one that did not involve government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgages. However, it failed in the marketplace. Subsequently, Lewis Ranieri (Salomon) and Larry Fink (First Boston) invented the idea of securitization; different mortgages were pooled together and this pool was then sliced into tranches, each of which was then sold separately to different investors. Many of these tranches were in turn bundled together, earning them the name CDO (Collateralized debt obligation).

The first CDOs to be issued by a private bank were seen in 1987 by the bankers at the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for the also now-defunct Imperial Savings Association. During the 1990s the collateral of CDOs was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans. After 1998 &quot;multi-sector&quot; CDOs were developed by Prudential Securities, but CDOs remained fairly obscure until after 2000. In 2002 and 2003 CDOs had a setback when rating agencies &quot;were forced to downgrade hundreds&quot; of the securities, but sales of CDOs grew—from $69 billion in 2000 to around $500 billion in 2006. From 2004 through 2007, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued.

Early CDOs were diversified, and might include everything from aircraft lease-equipment debt, manufactured housing loans, to student loans and credit card debt. The diversification of borrowers in these &quot;multisector CDOs&quot; was a selling point, as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted, other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected. Another selling point was that CDOs offered returns that were sometimes 2-3 percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating.

====Explanations for growth====
* Advantages of securitization – Depository banks had incentive to &quot;securitize&quot; loans they originated—often in the form of CDO securities—because this removes the loans from their books. The transfer of these loans (along with related risk) to security-buying investors in return for cash frees up the banks&#x27; capital. This enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees.
* Global demand for fixed income investments – From 2000 to 2007, worldwide fixed income investment (i.e. investments in bonds and other conservative securities) roughly doubled in size to $70 trillion, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast, which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage-backed security (MBS) and collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies.
* Low interest rates – Fears of deflation, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a U.S. recession, and the U.S. trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from 2000 to 2004–5, according to Economist Mark Zandi. The low yield of the safe US Treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgage-backed CDOs with their relatively high-yields but credit ratings as high as the Treasuries. This search for yield by global investors caused many to purchase CDOs, though they lived to regret trusting the credit rating agencies&#x27; ratings.
* Pricing models – Gaussian copula models, introduced in 2001 by David X. Li, allowed for the rapid pricing of CDOs.

===Subprime mortgage boom===


In 2005, as the CDO market continued to grow, subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral. By 2004, mortgage-backed securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in CDOs. According to the &quot;Financial Crisis Inquiry Report&quot;, &quot;the CDO became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain&quot;, promoting an increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities without which lenders would have &quot;had less reason to push so hard to make&quot; non-prime loans. CDOs not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgage-backed securities, they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities. Between 2003 and 2007, Wall Street issued almost $700 billion in CDOs that included mortgage-backed securities as collateral. Despite this loss of diversification, CDO tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so &quot;uncorrelated&quot;—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default.

The rise of &quot;ratings arbitrage&quot;—i.e., pooling low-rated tranches to make CDOs—helped push sales of CDOs to about $500 billion in 2006, with a global CDO market of over US$1.5 trillion. CDO was the fastest-growing sector of the structured finance market between 2003 and 2006; the number of CDO tranches issued in 2006 (9,278) was almost twice the number of tranches issued in 2005 (4,706).

CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course.

====Explanations for growth====
Subprime mortgages had been financed by mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Like CDOs, MBSs were structured into tranches, but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower level/lower-rated &quot;mezzanine&quot; tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from AA to BB.
Because most traditional mortgage investors are risk-averse, either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices, they are interested in buying the higher-rated segments of the loan stack; as a result, those slices are easiest to sell. The more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces at the bottom of the pile. The way mortgage securities are structured, if you cannot find buyers for the lower-rated slices, the rest of the pool cannot be sold.

To deal with the problem, investment bankers &quot;recycled&quot; the mezzanine tranches, selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches, most of the tranches (70 to 80%) of the CDO were rated not BBB, A−, etc., but triple A. The minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated tranches still further. (See the chart on &quot;The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages&quot;.)

As journalist Gretchen Morgenson put it, CDOs became &quot;the perfect dumping ground for the low-rated slices Wall Street couldn&#x27;t sell on its own.&quot;

Other factors explaining the popularity of CDOs include:
* Growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued. A &quot;global savings glut&quot; leading to &quot;large capital inflows&quot; from abroad helped finance the housing boom, keeping down US mortgage rates, even after the Federal Reserve Bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy.
* Supply generated by &quot;hefty&quot; fees the CDO industry earned. According to &quot;one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in CDOs&quot;, as much &quot;as 40 to 50 percent&quot; of the cash flow generated by the assets in a CDO went to &quot;pay the bankers, the CDO manager, the rating agencies, and others who took out fees.&quot; Rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the CDO tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by CDO issuers —earned extraordinary profits. Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, one of the two biggest rating agencies, could earn &quot;as much as $250,000 to rate a mortgage pool with $350 million in assets, versus the $50,000 in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size.&quot; In 2006, revenues from Moody&#x27;s structured finance division &quot;accounted for fully 44%&quot; of all Moody&#x27;s sales. Moody&#x27;s operating margins were &quot;consistently over 50%, making it one of the most profitable companies in existence&quot;—more profitable in terms of margins than ExxonMobil or Microsoft. Between the time Moody&#x27;s was spun off as a public company and February 2007, its stock rose 340%.
* Trust in rating agencies. CDO managers &quot;didn&#x27;t always have to disclose what the securities contained&quot; because the contents of the CDO were subject to change. But this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors &quot;weren&#x27;t so much buying a security. They were buying a triple-A rating,&quot; according to business journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera.
* Financial innovations, such as credit default swaps and synthetic CDO. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear &quot;to be virtually risk-free&quot; to investors. Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original &quot;cash&quot; CDOs. Synthetics &quot;referenced&quot; cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default. If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large investment bank or hedge fund) had to pay another. As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original, the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically.

===Crash===
In the summer of 2006, the Case–Shiller index of house prices peaked. In California, home prices had more than doubled since 2000 and median house prices in Los Angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income. To entice those with low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages, down payments and income documentation were often dispensed with and interest and principal payments were often deferred upon request. Journalist Michael Lewis gave as an example of unsustainable underwriting practices a loan in Bakersfield, California, where &quot;a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000&quot;. As two-year &quot;teaser&quot; mortgage rates—common with those that made home purchases like this possible—expired, mortgage payments skyrocketed. Refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices. Mezzanine tranches started to lose value in 2007; by mid year AA tranches were worth only 70 cents on the dollar. By October triple-A tranches had started to fall. Regional diversification notwithstanding, the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated.

Big CDO arrangers like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UBS experienced some of the biggest losses, as did financial guaranteers such as AIG, Ambac, MBIA.

An early indicator of the crisis came in July 2007 when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgage-related securities (by the end of 2008 91% of CDO securities were downgraded), and two highly leveraged Bear Stearns hedge funds holding MBSs and CDOs collapsed. Investors were informed by Bear Stearns that they would get little if any of their money back.

In October and November the CEOs of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup resigned after reporting multibillion-dollar losses and CDO downgrades. As the global market for CDOs dried up the new issue pipeline for CDOs slowed significantly, and what CDO issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middle-market or leveraged bank loans, rather than home mortgage ABS. The CDO collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger MBS market depended on CDO purchases of mezzanine tranches.

While non-prime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages, CDOs were especially hard hit. More than half—$300 billion worth—of tranches issued in 2005, 2006, and 2007 rated most safe (triple-A) by rating agencies, were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by 2009. In comparison, only small fractions of triple-A tranches of Alt-A or subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered the same fate. (See the Impaired Securities chart.)

Collateralized debt obligations also made up over half ($542 billion) of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from 2007 to early 2009.

===Criticism===
Prior to the crisis, a few academics, analysts and investors such as Warren Buffett (who famously disparaged CDOs and other derivatives as &quot;financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal&quot;), and the IMF&#x27;s former chief economist Raghuram Rajan warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widely.

During and after the crisis, criticism of the CDO market was more vocal. According to the radio documentary &quot;Giant Pool of Money&quot;, it was the strong demand for MBS and CDO that drove down home lending standards. Mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted.

The head of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, Patrick Parkinson, termed &quot;the whole concept of ABS CDOs&quot;, an &quot;abomination&quot;.

In December 2007, journalists Carrick Mollenkamp and Serena Ng wrote of a CDO called Norma created by Merrill Lynch at the behest of Illinois hedge fund, Magnetar. It was a tailor-made bet on subprime mortgages that went &quot;too far.&quot; Janet Tavakoli, a Chicago consultant who specializes in CDOs, said Norma &quot;is a tangled hairball of risk.&quot; When it came to market in March 2007, &quot;any savvy investor would have thrown this...in the trash bin.&quot;

According to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, no securities became &quot;more pervasive – or [did] more damage than collateralized debt obligations&quot; to create the Great Recession.

Gretchen Morgenson described the securities as &quot;a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages [that] created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders.&quot;
CDOs prolonged the mania, vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like Citigroup and the American International Group.&quot; ...

In the first quarter of 2008 alone, credit rating agencies announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs. At least some analysts complained the agencies over-relied on computer models with imprecise inputs, failed to account adequately for large risks (like a nationwide collapse of housing values), and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up CDOs would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated, and when one mortgage defaulted, many did, affected by the same financial events.

They were strongly criticized by economist Joseph Stiglitz, among others. Stiglitz considered the agencies &quot;one of the key culprits&quot; of the crisis that &quot;performed that alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies.&quot; According to Morgenson, the agencies had pretended to transform &quot;dross into gold.&quot;

&quot;As usual, the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of Wall Street&#x27;s rocket scientists. Fitch, Moody&#x27;s, and S&amp;P paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and, not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend, accommodate, and impress the Wall Street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay. ... Their [the rating agencies] failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies&#x27; models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate.&quot;

Michael Lewis also pronounced the transformation of BBB tranches into 80% triple A CDOs as &quot;dishonest&quot;, &quot;artificial&quot; and the result of &quot;fat fees&quot; paid to rating agencies by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms. However, if the collateral had been sufficient, those ratings would have been correct, according to the FDIC.

Synthetic CDOs were criticized in particular, because of the difficulties to judge (and price) the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation.

Others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lender&#x27;s incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization. According to economist Mark Zandi: &quot;As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined.&quot;

Zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation. &quot;Finance companies weren&#x27;t subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren&#x27;t on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards.&quot;

==Concept, structures, varieties==

===Concept===
CDOs vary in structure and underlying assets, but the basic principle is the same. A CDO is a type of asset-backed security. To create a CDO, a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors. A sequence in constructing a CDO is:
* A special purpose entity (SPE) is designed/constructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets. Common underlying assets held may include mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans.
* The SPE issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash, which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets. Like other ABS private label securities, the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches, each with different risk characteristics. Senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches. Losses are first borne by the equity tranches, next by the junior tranches, and finally by the senior tranches.

A common analogy compares the cash flow from the CDO&#x27;s portfolio of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches, then equity tranches. If a large portion of the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.

The risk and return for a CDO investor depends both on how the tranches are defined, and on the underlying assets. In particular, the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches. CDOs, like all asset-backed securities, enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors. Thus investors must understand how the risk for CDOs is calculated.

The issuer of the CDO, typically an investment bank, earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the CDO. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating CDOs, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality.

In some cases, the assets held by one CDO consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other CDOs. This explains why some CDOs became entirely worthless, as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there was not sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages (many of which defaulted) to trickle down to the equity layers.

Ultimately the challenge is in accurately quantifying the risk and return characteristics of these constructs. Since the introduction of David Li&#x27;s 2001 model, there have been material advances in techniques that more accurately model dynamics for these complex securities.

===Structures===
CDO refers to several different types of products. The primary classifications are as follows:

;Source of funds—cash flow vs. market value
* &quot;Cash flow CDOs&quot; pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the CDO&#x27;s assets. Cash flow CDOs focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.
* &quot;Market value CDOs&quot; attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets. The CDO asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the CDO&#x27;s portfolio. There is greater focus on the changes in market value of the CDO&#x27;s assets. Market value CDOs are longer-established, but less common than cash flow CDOs.

;Motivation—arbitrage vs. balance sheet
* &quot;Arbitrage transactions&quot; (cash flow and market value) attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds. The majority, 86%, of CDOs are arbitrage-motivated.
* &quot;Balance sheet transactions&quot;, by contrast, are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions&#x27; desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets, to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital. A bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheet&#x27;s credit risk.

;Funding—cash vs. synthetic
* &quot;Cash CDOs&quot; involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities or mortgage-backed securities. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO&#x27;s tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.
* &quot;Synthetic CDOs&quot; do not own cash assets like bonds or loans. Instead, synthetic CDOs gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the Synthetic CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event.) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the Synthetic CDO&#x27;s portfolio is divided into tranches. Losses will first affect the equity tranche, next the junior tranches, and finally the senior tranche. Each tranche receives a periodic payment (the swap premium), with the junior tranches offering higher premiums.
** A synthetic CDO tranche may be either funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO&#x27;s reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio&#x27;s losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO&#x27;s tranches can be precisely structured.
* &quot;Hybrid CDOs&quot; have a portfolio including both cash assets—like cash CDOs—and swaps that give the CDO credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic CDO. A portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps. The CDO receives payments from three sources: the return from the cash assets, the GIC or reserve account investments, and the CDO premiums.

;Single-tranche CDOs
:The flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct Single Tranche CDOs (bespoke tranche CDOs) where the entire CDO is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors, and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models. Residual risk is delta-hedged by the dealer.

;Structured Operating Companies
:Unlike CDOs, which are terminating structures that typically wind-down or refinance at the end of their financing term, Structured Operating Companies are permanently capitalized variants of CDOs, with an active management team and infrastructure. They often issue term notes, commercial paper, and/or auction rate securities, depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company. Credit Derivative Products Companies (CDPC) and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIV) are examples, with CDPC taking risk synthetically and SIV with predominantly &#x27;cash&#x27; exposure.

===Taxation===
The issuer of a CDO—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the United States to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its global income. These corporations must restrict their activities to avoid U.S. tax liabilities; corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the U.S. will be subject to federal taxation. Foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of U.S. stock and debt securities are not. Investing, unlike trading or dealing, is not considered to be a trade or business, regardless of its volume or frequency.

In addition, a safe harbor protects CDO issuers that do trade actively in securities, even though trading in securities technically is a business, provided the issuer&#x27;s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking, lending or similar businesses.

CDOs are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of CDOs which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules (such as PFIC and CFC reporting). The PFIC and CFC reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and manage the tax reporting obligations.

===Types===
A) Based on the underlying asset:
* Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged bank loans.
* Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged fixed income securities.
* Collateralized synthetic obligations (CSOs): CDOs backed primarily by credit derivatives.
* Structured finance CDOs (SFCDOs): CDOs backed primarily by structured products (such as asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities).

B) Other types of CDOs by assets/collateral include:
* Commercial Real Estate CDOs (CRE CDOs): backed primarily by commercial real estate assets
* Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by corporate bonds
* Collateralized Insurance Obligations (CIOs): backed by insurance or, more usually, reinsurance contracts
* CDO-Squared: CDOs backed primarily by the tranches issued by other CDOs.
* CDO^n: Generic term for CDO3 (CDO cubed) and higher, where the CDO is backed by other CDOs/CDO2/CDO3. These are particularly difficult vehicles to model because of the possible repetition of exposures in the underlying CDO.

===Types of collateral===
The collateral for cash CDOs include:
* Structured finance securities (mortgage-backed securities, home equity asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities)
* Leveraged loans
* Corporate bonds
* Real estate investment trust (REIT) debt
* Commercial real estate mortgage debt (including whole loans, B notes, and Mezzanine debt)
* Project finance debt
* Trust Preferred securities

===Transaction participants===
Participants in a CDO transaction include investors, the underwriter, the asset manager, the trustee and collateral administrator, accountants and attorneys. Beginning in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed banks to also participate.

====Investors====
Investors—buyers of CDO—include insurance companies, mutual fund companies, unit trusts, investment trusts, commercial banks, investment banks, pension fund managers, private banking organizations, other CDOs and structured investment vehicles. Investors have different motivations for purchasing CDO securities depending on which tranche they select. At the more senior levels of debt, investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities (e.g., corporate bonds) of a similar rating. In some cases, investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing. This is true because senior tranches pay a spread above LIBOR despite their AAA-ratings. Investors also benefit from the diversification of the CDO portfolio, the expertise of the asset manager, and the credit support built into the transaction. Investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds.

Junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged, non-recourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio. Mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities. Investors include hedge funds, banks, and wealthy individuals.

====Underwriter====
The underwriter of a CDO is typically an investment bank, and acts as the structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO&#x27;s portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche.

The key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders. Such a determination requires estimating the after-default return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the CDO&#x27;s rated notes. The excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive IRRs to the equity holders.

Other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle (typically a trust incorporated in the Cayman Islands) that will purchase the assets and issue the CDO&#x27;s tranches. In addition, the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the post-closing trading restrictions that will be included in the CDO&#x27;s transaction documents and other files.

The final step is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each debt tranche) and place the tranches with investors. The priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.

According to Thomson Financial, the top underwriters before September 2008 were Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America Securities. CDOs are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved. The underwriter is paid a fee when the CDO is issued.

====The asset manager====
The asset manager plays a key role in each CDO transaction, even after the CDO is issued. An experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the CDO&#x27;s portfolio. The manager can maintain the credit quality of a CDO&#x27;s portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur.

In theory, the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below, although in practice, this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade). In addition, it is now understood that the structural flaw in all asset-backed securities (originators profit from loan volume not loan quality) make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment.

The asset manager&#x27;s role begins in the months before a CDO is issued, a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming CDO. This process is called warehousing.

Even by the issuance date, the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the CDO&#x27;s portfolio. A &quot;ramp-up&quot; period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the CDO is issued. For this reason, some senior CDO notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes, allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made. When a transaction is fully ramped, its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager.

However, the asset manager&#x27;s role continues even after the ramp-up period ends, albeit in a less active role. During the CDO&#x27;s &quot;reinvestment period&quot;, which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the CDO, the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities. Within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the CDO&#x27;s transaction documents, the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the CDO&#x27;s portfolio. The manager also has a role in the redemption of a CDO&#x27;s notes by auction call.

There are approximately 300 asset managers in the marketplace. CDO asset managers, as with other asset managers, can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the CDO. Asset managers make money by virtue of the senior fee (which is paid before any of the CDO investors are paid) and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the CDO, making CDOs a lucrative business for asset managers. These fees, together with underwriting fees, administration—approx 1.5 – 2% —by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment, by virtue of reduced cash flow.

====The trustee and collateral administrator====
The trustee holds title to the assets of the CDO for the benefit of the &quot;noteholders&quot; (i.e., the investors). In the CDO market, the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator. In this role, the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports, performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models. In contrast to the asset manager, there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace. The following institutions offer trustee services in the CDO marketplace:
* Bank of New York Mellon (note: the Bank of New York Mellon acquired the corporate trust unit of JP Morgan),
* BNP Paribas Securities Services (note: currently serves the European market only)
* Citibank
* Deutsche Bank
* Equity Trust
* Intertrust Group (note: until mid-2009 was known as Fortis Intertrust; Acquired ATC Capital Markets in 2013)
* HSBC
* Sanne Trust
* State Street Corporation
* US Bank (note: US Bank acquired the corporate trust unit of Wachovia in 2008 and Bank of America in September 2011, which had previously acquired LaSalle Bank in 2010, and is the current market share leader)
* Wells Fargo
* Wilmington Trust: Wilmington shut down their business in early 2009.

====Accountants====
The underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the CDO&#x27;s portfolio of debt securities. This entails verifying certain attributes, such as credit rating and coupon/spread, of each collateral security. Source documents or public sources will typically be used to tie-out the collateral pool information. In addition, the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests.

The firm may also perform a cash flow tie-out in which the transaction&#x27;s waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents. The yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter. On each payment date, an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders.

====Attorneys====
Attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents. Attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose certain information to investors. This will be circulated to investors. It is common for multiple counsels to be involved in a single deal because of the number of parties to a single CDO from asset management firms to underwriters.

In the 2015 biographical film &quot;The Big Short&quot;, CDOs of mortgage-backed securities are described metaphorically as &quot;dog shit wrapped in cat shit&quot;.

<text>Junior Malili&quot;Mils&quot;Muliaina (born 31 July 1980) is a former professional rugby union player who most recently played for San Francisco Rush in the US PRO Rugby competition. He played primarily as a fullback, though he has also played as a centre and on the wing.

Born in Salelesi, Samoa, Muliaina moved with his family to Invercargill, New Zealand, at the age of three. At international level Muliaina played for from 2003 until his retirement after the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Muliaina became only the second All Black to reach 100 caps during the World Cup quarter-final against in 2011. He scored 33 tries for New Zealand and remains among the top 30 highest try scorers in rugby union.

==Early career==
He first attended Cargill High School then Southland Boys&#x27; High School, where he proved proficient enough at rugby to be offered a scholarship to Kelston Boys&#x27; High School in Auckland, in 1998. Subsequently, Muliaina played for the NZ Secondary Schools XV, the team winning that year&#x27;s world championship. He repeated this the following year with the Under 19 side, and in 2000 and 2001 was part of the world champion Under 21 (NZ Colt) teams of those years.

==Super Rugby and the All Blacks==
Muliaina joined the Auckland Blues in 2001 and was a part of the Super 12 title-winning team for the Blues in 2003. Muliaina&#x27;s test debut for the All Blacks was against England on 14 June 2003 at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington. He was subsequently part of the All Black squad at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. In 2004, he was the only player to be selected for every test played by the All Blacks. Muliaina has also played in 11 tournaments for the sevens team, including winning a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2002 in Manchester. Though he has expressed a preference for playing as an outside centre, Muliaina generally plays at fullback. In 2006 he joined the Chiefs, with whom he brought up his 100th Super Rugby cap in 2011.

On 9 October 2011 during the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Muliaina played his 100th game for the All Blacks after starting at fullback against Argentina. During the game, Muliaina was forced from the field at half-time, having injured his shoulder. This was later revealed to have been fractured, meaning he was dropped from the New Zealand World Cup squad. Muliaina retired from the All Blacks squad the following day on 10 October 2011 after achieving his 100th Test cap and returned on 23 October 2011 to claim his gold medal after the All Blacks won the 2011 Rugby World Cup final.

==Europe==
As of 4 May 2014, Mils had signed a one-year contract for Irish provincial region Connacht in the Pro12. On 21 November 2014, Muliaina made his Connacht debut in a 43–3 win over Italian side Zebre at the Sportgrounds.

In July 2015, Muliaina was charged with sexual assault following an incident with a woman in a Cardiff night club. The charge was dropped in October 2015 on evidential grounds.

==United States==
It was announced in March 2016 that Muliaina would play the upcoming season in the United States in the newly formed PRO Rugby competition. He joined the San Francisco Rush midway through the inaugural 2016 season.

<text>Dressy Bessy is an indie rock band from Denver, Colorado led by songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist, Tammy Ealom. The band is associated with the Elephant Six Recording Company and shares guitarist John Hill with The Apples in Stereo. Ealom formed the band with drummer Darren Albert and bassist Rob Greene in 1996. Hill joined the band after helping engineer early recordings in 1997. The name was taken from a popular Playskool doll of the 1970s.

== 1996–Present ==

They released two singles and an EP in 1997–98 and licensed songs to some compilation albums.

Dressy Bessy&#x27;s first full-length release &quot;Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons&quot; (1999) was a mixture of beat group drums, infectious songs, and the odd burst of harmonium. Further releases include The California EP (2000), &quot;Sound Go Round&quot; (2002), and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dressy Bessy&quot;, which incorporated a harder guitar sound. 2003 also brought the compilation &quot;Little Music: Singles 1997-2002&quot;. These albums were initially released on Kindercore Records of Athens, Georgia. Their songs &quot;If You Should Try to Kiss Her&quot; and &quot;Just Like Henry&quot; were featured in the 1999 indie film &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;.

In late 2003, drummer Darren Albert left the band and was replaced in 2005 by Craig Gilbert. Later that year, the band signed to Transdreamer Records and recorded their fourth album, &quot;Electrified&quot;, which was released in June 2005. The band released &quot;HOLLERandSTOMP,&quot; on September 16, 2008.

Dressy Bessy released KINGSIZED on Yep Roc Records (CD, LP) and Burger Records (CS), February 5, 2016.

The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, titled &quot;Fast Faster Disaster&quot;, was released June 14, 2019 by Yep Roc Records and Burger Records

<text>The Tumulus culture (German: &quot;Hügelgräberkultur&quot;) was the dominant material culture in Central Europe during the Middle Bronze Age ( 1600 to 1300 BC).

It was the descendant of the Unetice culture. Its heartland was the area previously occupied by the Unetice culture, and its territory included parts of Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, the Carpathian Basin, Poland and France. It was succeeded by the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture and part of the origin of the Italic and Celtic cultures.

==Artefacts and characteristics==
The Tumulus culture is distinguished by the practice of burying the dead beneath burial mounds (tumuli or kurgans).

In 1902, Paul Reinecke distinguished a number of cultural horizons based on research of Bronze Age hoards and tumuli in periods covered by these cultural horizons are shown in the table below (right). The Tumulus culture was prevalent during the Bronze Age periods B, C1, and C2. Tumuli have been used elsewhere in Europe from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the term &quot;Tumulus culture&quot; specifically refers to the South German variant of the Bronze Age. In the table, Ha designates Hallstatt. Archaeological horizons Hallstatt A–B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture, while horizons Hallstatt C–D are the type site for the Iron Age Hallstatt culture.

The Tumulus culture was eminently a warrior society, which expanded with new chiefdoms eastward into the Carpathian Basin (up to the river Tisza), and northward into Polish and Central European Únětice territories. The culture&#x27;s dispersed settlements consisted of villages or homesteads centered on fortified structures such as hillforts. Significant fortified settlements include the Heuneburg, Bullenheimer Berg, Ehrenbürg, and Bernstorf. Fortification walls were built from wood, stone and clay. The massive 3.6m-wide wall surrounding the plateau of the Ehrenbürg resembled later &quot;murus gallicus&quot; fortifications known from the Iron Age. &#x27;Cyclopean&#x27; stone fortifications topped with wooden battlements were constructed at the large hillfort of Stätteberg in Bavaria.

Tumulus culture societies traded with those in Scandinavia, Atlantic Europe, the Mediterranean region and the Aegean. Traded items included amber and metal artefacts. From the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age there is evidence for the use of weighed metal as form of payment or money. Weighing equipment has been found in central Europe dating from c. 1400 BC onwards.

Some scholars see Tumulus groups from southern Germany as corresponding to a community that shared an extinct Indo-European linguistic entity, such as the hypothetical Italo-Celtic group that was ancestral to Italic and Celtic. This particular hypothesis, however, conflicts with suggestions by other Indo-Europeanists. For instance, David W. Anthony suggests that Proto-Italic (and perhaps also Proto-Celtic) speakers could have entered Northern Italy at an earlier stage, from the east (e.g., the Balkan/Adriatic region).

The Bronze Hand of Prêles from Switzerland, dating from the 16th-15th century BC, is a unique find from the Tumulus culture period. Described as &quot;the earliest metal representation of a human body part ever found in Europe&quot;, it may have been a ritual object, or mounted on a standard like similar metal hands known from the Iron Age, or possibly a prosthesis. It was found in a grave along with a bronze hair-ring, pin and dagger. The hand had a golden bracelet or cuff decorated with solar motifs.

Golden hats from Schifferstadt in Germany and Avanton in France, dating from the late Tumulus period (c. 1400 BC), may have been worn by elite religious figures, described as &#x27;oracles&#x27; or &#x27;king-priests&#x27; by researchers. The patterns of ornaments or symbols on the hats are thought to represent calendars, as on the later and more elaborate Berlin Gold Hat, which may encode knowledge of the luni-solar Metonic cycle. Gold discs from the Czech Republic, dating from c. 1650-1250 BC, feature similar ornaments and are thought to represent simpler calendars. Identical &#x27;ritual objects&#x27; from Haschendorf in Austria and Balkåkra in Sweden may also date from the Middle Bronze Age and have been interpreted as solar calendars. Simple numerals on the objects in the form of lines and dots represent assembly instructions for the objects. Similar &#x27;counting marks&#x27; were used by craftsmen in the production of swords.

<text>&quot;Captain&quot; Virgulino Ferreira da Silva (; 7 June 1897 – 28 July 1938), better known as Lampião (older spelling: &quot;Lampeão&quot;, , meaning &quot;lantern&quot; or &quot;oil lamp&quot;), was probably the twentieth century&#x27;s most successful traditional bandit leader. The banditry endemic to the Brazilian Northeast was called &quot;Cangaço&quot;. &quot;Cangaço&quot; had origins in the late 19th century but was particularly prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s. Lampião led a band of up to 100 &quot;cangaceiros&quot;, who occasionally took over small towns and who fought a number of successful actions against paramilitary police when heavily outnumbered. Lampião&#x27;s exploits and reputation turned him into a folk hero, the Brazilian equivalent of Jesse James or Pancho Villa. His image, as well as that of his partner Maria Bonita, can be seen across the entirety of the Northeast of Brazil.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Virgulino was born on June 7, 1897, near the village of Serra Talhada, on his father&#x27;s &#x27;ranch&#x27; named &quot;Passagem das Pedras&quot; in the semi-arid backlands (&quot;sertão&quot;) of the state of Pernambuco. He was the third of nine children of José Ferreira da Silva and Maria Lopes, a humble family of subsistence farmers. Until he was 21 years old, he worked hard herding his father&#x27;s few cattle, sheep and goats, becoming a skilled rider and &#x27;cowboy&#x27;. He was also an accomplished leathercraft artisan. Though he never attended school he was literate and used reading glasses—both quite unusual features for the rough and poor region where he lived.

The backlands had little in the way of law and order, even the few police in existence were usually in the pocket of a local &quot;Coronel&quot; – a leading landowner who was also a regional political chief – and would usually take sides in any dispute. Indeed, the poorer portion of the backlands population were generally badly treated by the paramilitary police, and would often prefer the presence of bandits in their settlements over that of the police. In such a society disputes between neighbours could quickly escalate into violent feuding. Virgulino&#x27;s family fell into a deadly feud with other local families. His father twice moved his family to avoid the escalating dispute, first to Nazaré, and then to Água Branca in the State of Alagoas. These moves proved to be fruitless as violence followed the family, with Virgulino and his brothers Antônio and Levino gaining reputations as troublemakers. Eventually José Ferreira was killed in a confrontation with the police on May 18, 1921. Virgulino sought vengeance and proved to be extremely violent in doing so. He became an outlaw, a &quot;cangaceiro&quot;, and was incessantly pursued by the police (whom he called &quot;macacos&quot; or monkeys). Virgulino had acquired the nickname &#x27;Lampião&#x27; as early as 1921, allegedly because he could fire a lever-action rifle so fast, that at night it looked as though he was holding a lamp.

===Bandit leader===

Lampião became associated with an established bandit leader, Sebastião Pereira. After only a few months of operating together, in 1922, Pereira decided to retire from banditry; he moved to the State of Goiás and lived there peacefully into advanced old age. Lampião then took over leadership of the remnants of Pereira&#x27;s band. For the next 16 years, he led his band of &quot;cangaceiros&quot;, which varied greatly in number from around a dozen to up to a hundred, in a career of large-scale banditry through seven states of the Brazilian Northeast.

Depending on the terrain and other conditions, the bandits operated either on horseback or on foot. They were heavily armed, and wore leather outfits, including hats, jackets, sandals, ammunition belts, and trousers, to protect them from the thorns of the caatinga, the dry shrub and typical of the dry hinterland of Brazil&#x27;s Northeast. The police and soldiers stationed in the backlands often dressed in an identical manner; on more than one occasion Lampião impersonated a police officer, especially when moving into a new area of operations, in order to gain information.

The firearms and ammunition of the &quot;cangaceiros&quot; were mostly stolen, or acquired by bribery, from the police and paramilitary units and consisted of Mauser military rifles and a variety of small arms including Winchester rifles, revolvers and the prized Luger and Mauser semi-automatic pistols.

A strange and contradictory piety ran through Lampião&#x27;s psyche: while robbing and killing people, he also prayed regularly and reverenced the Church and priests. He wore many religious symbols on his person; presumably, he invested them with talismanic qualities. Like many others in the region he particularly revered Padre Cícero, the charismatic priest of Juazeiro. He was noted for his loyalty to those he befriended or to whom he owed a debt of gratitude. He generously rewarded his followers and those of the population who shielded or materially helped him (&quot;coiteiros&quot;), and he was entirely reliable if he gave his word of honour. Lampião was capable of acts of mercy and even charity, however, he systematically used terror to achieve his own survival. His enmity, once aroused, was implacable and he killed many people merely because they had an association with someone who had displeased him. He is recorded as having said &quot;If you have to kill, kill quickly. But for me killing a thousand is just like killing one&quot;. For the &quot;cangaceiros&quot; murder was not only casual, they took pride in their efficiency in killing. They were excellent shots and were skilled in the use of long, narrow knives (nicknamed &quot;peixeiras&quot; – &quot;fish-filleters&quot;) which could be used to dispatch a man quickly.

Lampião&#x27;s band attacked small towns and farms in seven states, took hostages for ransom, extorted money by threats of violence, tortured, fire-branded, and maimed; it has been claimed that they killed over 1,000 people and 5,000 head of cattle and raped over 200 women. The band fought the police over 200 times and Lampião was wounded six times. 
A typical example of Lampião&#x27;s activities, and his ambivalent nature, is his descent on the small town of Queimadas in Bahia, which took place in December 1929. His band entered the town, and immediately shut down the telegraph office to stop news from spreading. The seven policemen in the town and their sergeant were shut in the jail, whilst the jail&#x27;s previous occupants were set free. The wealthiest citizens of the town were then levied for a forced monetary contribution. The bandits, however, paid for items, including soap and perfume, taken from the town&#x27;s shops. The seven policemen were summarily executed by shots to the head, but their sergeant was left unharmed as he was liked by the townspeople. In the evening Lampião organised a &quot;baile&quot;, a dance for the townspeople and his &quot;cangaceiros&quot;. He also ordered a cinema show to be presented. The bandits were under strict instructions not to molest the local young women, and such was Lampião&#x27;s authority that none were. The bandits left the town at 4:00 in the morning; Lampião rode a borrowed mule, which he later duly returned to its owner. On one occasion he attacked a large town, Mossoró, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, in June 1927. The bandits began their assault on the town to the sound of a bugle; when advancing they shouted &quot;vivas&quot; and sang their special song, &quot;Mulher Rendeira&quot; (The Lacemaker). However, the inhabitants had time to organise a defence, and 300 armed townsmen drove off Lampião&#x27;s 60 &quot;cangaceiros&quot;.

As well as engaging in criminal activities for gain or revenge Lampião&#x27;s band also fought a number of pitched battles with the &quot;volantes&quot; – mobile units of paramilitary police. Probably the largest of these battles was fought on 28 November 1926 near Serra Grande, twenty miles from Vila Bela. Lampião with around 100 &quot;cangaceiros&quot; fought off 295 soldiers, killing 10 and wounding a dozen more. At around this time Lampião took to calling himself the &quot;governor of the backlands&quot;, only partly in jest.

Lampião was joined in 1930 by his girlfriend, Maria Déia, nicknamed Maria Bonita (&quot;Pretty Maria&quot;). His relationship with Maria Bonita gave his reputation some of the &#x27;romance and violence&#x27; notoriety enjoyed in the United States by Bonnie and Clyde. The women who joined bandit groups, often termed &quot;cangaceiras&quot;, dressed like their male comrades and participated in many of their actions. Maria and Lampião had a daughter, named Expedita, in 1932. A number of &quot;cangaceiras&quot; joined the band over the many years of its existence and Lampião usually attended any births these women had personally. Such children, including Lampião&#x27;s own, were fostered out to settled relatives or friends of the &quot;cangaceiros&quot;, or left with priests. Expedita, Maria and Lampião&#x27;s daughter, born in 1932, was raised by her uncle João after the deaths of her parents. João Ferreira was the only one of Lampião&#x27;s brothers not to become an outlaw.

In 1935 Lampião and his band were filmed by Benjamin Abrahão Botto. Once reassured that the camera did not conceal a gun, Lampião co-operated enthusiastically with the filming. The film-stock was soon confiscated by the police, and Abrahão died in 1938. This cinematographic record was rediscovered in 1957, but had physically deteriorated to a great extent. However, several scenes survived, a unique example of moving images of Lampião, Maria Bonita and many other &quot;cangaceiros&quot;.

===Death===

On July 28, 1938, Lampião and his band were betrayed by one of his supporters, Joca Bernardes, and were ambushed in one of his hideouts, the Angicos farm, in the Poço Redondo area of the state of Sergipe. Bernardes, after first meeting Lampião in 1928, had dreamed that he would play a part in causing the famous bandit&#x27;s death. A police troop, led by João Bezerra and armed with machine guns, attacked the encamped bandits at daybreak. In a brief battle, Lampião, Maria Bonita and nine of his troops were killed, some forty other members of the bandit group managed to escape. The heads of those killed were cut off and sent to Salvador, the capital of Bahia, for examination by specialists at the State Forensic Institute. Later they were put on public exhibition in the city of Piranhas. In 1969, after more than 30 years, the mummified severed heads were removed from display at the Salvador museum and buried in the Quintas Cemetery in Salvador.

==The end of &quot;Cangaço&quot;==
In the early 1920s a large number of &quot;Cangaço&quot; bandit groups were in existence. When Lampião became a &quot;cangaceiro&quot;, joining the &quot;Cangaço&quot; was almost the equivalent of a career choice. At the time of Lampião&#x27;s death, he was the only independent bandit leader remaining. However, his major subordinates, such as Luis Pedro, Ângelo Roque and Corisco, often led bandits in semi-independent operations at a considerable distance from the main camp, sometimes across state borders. It was Lampião&#x27;s intelligence and charisma that ensured that large-scale banditry remained viable in the changing environment of late 1930s Brazil. Within two years of his death &quot;Cangaço&quot; was a thing of the past. A number of potential bandit leaders, such as Corisco, and lesser bandits were killed; many more gave themselves up to the authorities on assurance of escaping the death penalty. Ângelo Roque gave himself up, along with eight companions, in April 1940 at Bebedouro. Some bandits even turned on colleagues, killing and decapitating them; they then reported to the police with the severed head to show that their renunciation of banditry was sincere.

==Notable band members==
Lampião was active for a number of years and thus many men and women passed through his band. More notable ones included:

* Antônio Ferreira – Lampião&#x27;s eldest brother, died in an accident in 1926.
* Levino Ferreira – Lampião&#x27;s brother, killed in battle with police in July 1925.
* Ezequiel Ferreira – Lampião&#x27;s youngest brother, killed in battle with police in April 1931.
* Luis Pedro – a lieutenant and member of the band for over a decade, he returned to die by Lampião&#x27;s side even though he may have been able to escape. He accidentally killed Antônio Ferreira in 1926 when a gun went off during a wrestling bout. When told of his brother&#x27;s death Lampião said that Luis must take his place.
* Corisco (Cristino Gomes da Silva Cleto) – feared for his cruelty. There was speculation that he would take control of the band after Angicos, where he had not been present. Seeking vengeance for Angicos, Corisco interrogated Joca Bernardes the informant who had betrayed Lampião, who shifted the blame on someone else, Domingos Ventura. Corisco then murdered this entirely innocent person and his whole family, including two women. He was killed by police in 1940.
* Dadá (Sérgia Ribeiro da Silva), the wife of Corisco. She lost a leg as a result of injuries sustained in the fight in which Corisco was killed; she died in 1994.
* Ângelo Roque – a trusted lieutenant who was also not present when Lampião was killed. He operated until 1940 when he surrendered to police after being assured that he would not be executed for his crimes. He was initially sentenced to 95 years in prison, which was later reduced to 30 years and then commuted in 1950.
* Volta Sêca (&quot;Dry Gulch&quot; Antônio dos Santos) – joined the bandits aged 14 as a message-carrier. He was later interviewed in prison and his accounts were an important source for the history of Lampião&#x27;s activities. He composed and sang a number of songs about, or associated with, Lampião&#x27;s bandits; many years later, in 1957, these were recorded for a sound documentary by Todamérica.

==Legacy as a folk hero==
Despite his history of brutal acts and savagery, there was enough in his undoubted courage, his many fights against heavy odds, his occasional acts of mercy and charity, his conventional piety and calculated courting of publicity to ensure that Lampião entered Brazilian folk-history as a hero. One of the more dispassionate analyses of Lampião concluded that, if he was a hero, he was an anarchist hero who forged a prominent place for himself in a society and political environment where people put their own interests above all other considerations.

The story of Lampião and Maria Bonita became the subject of innumerable folk stories, books, comic books, popular pamphlets (cordel literature), songs, movies, and a number of TV soap operas, with all the elements of drama, passion, and violence typical of &quot;Wild West&quot; stories.

In 1957 the songs associated with Lampião&#x27;s bandits were recorded, as &quot;Cantigas de Lampião&quot;.

Joan Baez recorded a version of &quot;Mulher Rendeira&quot;, renamed &quot;O Cangaceiro&quot;, on her album Joan Baez/5 - released in October 1964.

Capoeira culture honors his folk hero status in a verse of the quadra (call and response style song), &#x27;Sim, Sim, Sim, Não, Não, Não&#x27;. Lampião was mentioned in the lyrics of &quot;Ratamahatta&quot;, a song of Brazilian metal band Sepultura, from their &quot;Roots&quot; record. In classical music, the composer Caio Facó wrote a piece (&quot;Cangaceiros e Fanaticos&quot;, for string quartet) inspired by the theme of &quot;Cangaço&quot;.

For the 2023 edition of the Carnival parade of the Rio de Janeiro samba schools Imperatriz Leopoldinense dedicated their performance to Lampião’s memory, complete with themes and images from his life. Expedita Ferreira, Lampião and Maria Bonita&#x27;s only child, participated in the parade being featured on the last float in the procession.

===&quot;Mulher Rendeira&quot; – The song of Lampião&#x27;s bandits===
The special song of Lampião&#x27;s band——is thought by some to have been composed by Lampião, who is known to have played the accordion, but it seems more likely that it was a traditional tune to which the bandits added their own words.

&quot;Olê, Mulher Rendeira, Olê mulher rendá&quot; --- &quot;&quot;Olê&quot;, Lacemaker woman, &quot;Olê&quot;&quot; lace woman

&quot;A pequena vai no bolso, a maior vai no embornal&quot; --- The small [gun] goes in the pocket, the large [gun] in a bag

&quot;Se chora por mim não fica, só se eu não puder levar&quot; --- Only cry for me, if I cannot take you away

&quot;O fuzil de Lampião, tem cinco laços de fita&quot; --- The rifle of Lampião, has five ribbons of cloth

&quot;O lugar que ele habita, não falta moça bonita&quot; --- The place he lives in, does not lack pretty girls</text><links>

<text>The Bitmap Brothers are a British video game developer founded in 1987. The company entered the video game industry in 1988 with the scrolling shooter &quot;Xenon&quot;. They quickly followed with &quot;Speedball&quot;. Prior to becoming the publisher of their own games (under Renegade Software), early Bitmap Brothers titles were distributed by Image Works and Konami.

The Bitmap Brothers released several games on the Amiga and Atari ST, Acorn Archimedes and DOS, and were one of the most successful companies on those platforms. They became known in particular for releasing games from a variety of different genres that usually came to be regarded as leaders in their respective fields. Their PC games have never matched the sales of their previous Amiga titles, despite garnering positive critical reviews in the press.

They publicized themselves as rock stars, and were featured in the press posing in dark glasses standing next to the helicopter of Robert Maxwell, the owner of Mirrorsoft, the publisher of a number of their games.

After 2002, the company also released ports of several of their games for both the Game Boy Advance and Pocket PC platforms, and since then they have been licensing their old games and properties to several other companies interested in attempting re-releases for modern platforms.

==History==
The Bitmap Brothers were based in Wapping, East London and were privately owned. The company&#x27;s MD was Mike Montgomery, who had founded the company together with Eric Matthews and Steve Kelly. Mike Montgomery later went on to take sole control of the business.

Mark John Coleman is a computer graphics developer who frequently worked with the Bitmap Brothers, and along with Dan Malone was responsible for the visual style that became a trademark of the Bitmap Brothers&#x27; games. Other key staff included Technical Director John Phillips, Art Director John Kershaw, Business Development Director Ed Bartlett and Creative Director Jamie Barber.

The Bitmap Brothers became known for the high difficulty of their games. Montgomery later remarked that &quot;all of the Bitmap Brothers games... they&#x27;re probably a bit too difficult. The reason for that was we designed games that we wanted to play - for us it was actually quite hard to think that somebody would want to play something that&#x27;s easy.&quot; The development team was voted Best 16-bit Programmers of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. Speedball was also voted best 16-bit Game of the Year overall.

Two former core members of the company — Mike Montgomery and John Phillips — went on to found Tower Studios (along with Sensible Software founder Jon Hare), and stated their involvement with Bitmap Brothers as having ended in 2004.

Business Development Director, Ed Bartlett went on to pioneer the in-game advertising industry, initially with Hive Partners and then with IGA Worldwide.

After years of silence a news post on the official website announced &quot;Speedball 2 Tournament&quot; which was released in November 2007 by Frogster Interactive, but failed to achieve the success of previous titles in the franchise.

In October 2010, it was announced that &quot;Speedball 2&quot; would be resurrected again, this time for the iPhone and iPad systems, with Vivid Games managing the conversion.

Following this, a mobile version of &quot;Z&quot; was developed by Peter Harrap and TickTock Games and was published by KavCom for devices running iOS and Android, with the touch screen usually available on these devices lending itself to a game of this genre.. It was released on iPhone and iPad in 2011, with further releases on BlackBerry Playbook, Android, and Kindle in 2012. The mobile version remake by TickTock Games was also released for Mac in 2012, and then published by Kiss Ltd and KavCom for Windows PC on Steam and GOG.com on 4 July 2014, together with a Steam release of &quot;Z: Steel Soldiers&quot; the following month.

On 2 July 2012, &quot;Speedball 2: Evolution&quot; was announced and released for Android in Google Play Store, and in 2013 &quot;The Chaos Engine&quot; was recreated for release on PC, Linux and Mac.

Rebellion Developments acquired the Bitmap Brothers back catalog in November 2019.

<text>Boyzvoice was a fictional Norwegian boy band, best known from the movie &quot;Get Ready to be Boyzvoiced&quot; (2000). They consisted of three band members: brothers M*Pete (Espen Eckbo), Hot Tub (Øyvind Thoen), and Roar Lund-Bergseter (Kaare Daniel Steen).

Boyzvoice was originally formed by Norwegian comedians/actors Espen Eckbo and Henrik Elvestad with the purpose to make fun of boy bands and the commercial music industry. Boyzvoice first appeared on a late-night Norwegian talk-show in 1999 and the same year they climbed the charts in Norway with their Christmas single &quot;Let Me Be Your Father X-mas&quot;, but Verdens Gang took the song as sincere and described it as a &quot;cliche orgasm&quot; that couldn&#x27;t be taken seriously, before rating it at one of six.

In &quot;Get Ready to be Boyzvoiced&quot;, a mockumentary about their lives, first released in 2000, they have to overcome a scandal involving lip-synching over recordings made by session musicians, which results in their being dropped by their record company — reminiscent of the real-life incident involving Milli Vanilli. The scandal is further fed by their manager Timothy Dahle (Henrik Elvestad) physically assaulting two elderly members of the Salvation Army at a charity concert, and the discovery that lead-singer M*Pete&#x27;s 16-year-old girlfriend (Ida Thorkildsen Valvik) lied about her age and is in fact only 12.

<text>Gopinath Bordoloi (6 June 1890 – 5 August 1950) was an Indian politician and independence activist who served as the 1st Chief Minister of Assam from 1946 to 1950. He was also the chairman of North-East Frontier Tribal areas and Assam Excluded and Partially Excluded Areas Sub-Committee. He was a follower of the Gandhian principle of non-violence as a political tool. Due to his unselfish dedication towards Assam and its people, the then Governor of Assam Jayram Das Doulatram conferred him with the title &quot;Lokpriya&quot; (loved by all).

==Early life and education==

Gopinath Bordoloi was born on 6 June 1890 at Raha. His father was Buddheswar Bordoloi and mother Praneswari Bordoloi. He lost his mother when he was only 12 years old. He got admitted in Cotton College (then an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta, now a separate autonomous university) after passing matriculation in 1907. He passed I.A. in 1st Div. In 1909 and took admission in the renowned Scottish Church College (also affiliated to the University of Calcutta) and graduated in 1911. He then passed M.A. from the University of Calcutta in 1914. He studied Law for three years but came back to Guwahati without sitting in the final examination. Then on request of Tarun Ram Phukan, he took up the temporary job as Headmaster of Sonaram High School. During that period, he sat and passed in the Law examination and started practicing in 1917 in Guwahati.

==Political life==
The Assam Association was the only political organisation of Assam in that period. Assam Congress was formed in 1921 as a branch of the Indian National Congress. Gopinath Bordoloi&#x27;s political life started when he joined the Indian National Congress as a volunteer in that year. He actively participated in the fight for independence. 

Bordoloi gave up his law practice to engage deeply in the Non-co-operation movement. He was arrested in 1922 for his involvement, and put in jail for a year. He was arrested in 1922 due to active participation in the Non-co-operation movement and was put in jail for a year. When the movement was called off following the Chauri Chaura incident, he went back to practising law. From 1930 to 1933, he kept himself away from all political activity and got involved in various social works after becoming member of Guwahati Municipal Board and Local Board. In addition, he was constantly demanding a separate University and High Court for Assam.

In 1935 Government of India Act was articulated with a view to form British India. Congress decided to participate in the Regional Assembly election in 1936. They won 38 seats and became the party with majority in Assembly, but due to a dubious law meant to reduce the power of Ministers and the Cabinet, they decided to remain as opposition party instead of forming the government. Gopinath Bordoloi was elected as the leader of the opposition party. With the support of other parties apart from Congress, Md. Sadulla formed the Cabinet of Ministers. The Congress party was gaining people&#x27;s support as the government remained unaware of the basic problems of Assam. The Md. Sadulla Cabinet Ministers resigned in September 1938. The Governor then invited Gopinath Bordoloi to form the government and accordingly they took oath on 21 September.

The reasons of Gopinath Bordoloi becoming Chief Minister of undivided Assam were his political prowess, superb personality, truthfulness and behaviour which attracted not only his colleagues but also people of various communities. Congress got recognition as a powerful political party in Assam by virtue of his ability and intelligence. His contributions as Chief Minister were mainly to stop Land Tax, stop giving lands to migrant Muslims to secure the right of indigenous people etc.

The new government did not last long as World War II began in 1939. Gopinath Bordoloi&#x27;s Cabinet resigned in 1940 following an appeal by Mohandas K. Gandhi. He was arrested again in December 1940. However, he was released before completing one year in jail due to ill health. When Quit India movement was launched in August 1942, the Congress party was declared outlawed and all leaders were arrested.

In the meantime, Md. Sadulla formed the government with the promise to help British in World War II and indulged again in communal activities. Gopinath Bordoloi was released from jail in 1944 and he straightaway started opposing the government with the help of other leaders. Md. Sadullah then offered to discuss the matters. An agreement was reached which included immediate release of all political prisoners, removing the ban on procession or meeting, correcting the process of rehabilitation of migrant Muslims, etc.

Bordoloi was instrumental in forming a peace brigade in Assam to maintain the morale of followers of non-violence amidst Japanese advancement to the region from Burma. The brigade aided war refugees coming from Burma and Malaya. 

In July 1945, the British announced their decision to form a new constitution for India after holding the central and regional election. Congress too participated in the election in 1946 and they became the major party in Assembly with 58 seats out of 108. They formed the Government and Gopinath Bordoloi was made Chief Minister unanimously.

==Cabinet commission and Bordoloi&#x27;s role==

The British Government formed the Cabinet Mission of 1946 to discuss the demands for Indian Independence. The members held meetings with the Congress and the Muslim League in Shimla and Delhi. Their plan included grouping of states into 3 categories for selecting the candidates to form the constitutional body with Assam and Bengal in third group. Gopinath Bordoloi sensed the ominous sign for Assam in the plan as the inclusion would mean the local representatives will become minority in comparison to Bengal. That would be devastating for rights of people of Assam.

The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee decided to go against the grouping plan. Gopinath Bordoloi told the Indian National Congress working committee, Cabinet committee and the Viceroy that the representatives of Assam will form the Constitution of Assam themselves and will decide whether to join the group or not among themselves. Subsequently, the Cabinet commission announced that the grouping will be mandatory for every state and they may later withdraw from the group if they want. This further complicated the situation. Bordoloi met the Indian National Congress leaders to discuss it with no result. He then, with the Assam Congress Committee, decided to start mass agitation in Assam. Only after this, the Indian National Congress working committee advised them to pass a unanimous decision in Assembly. Later, the members of the Assembly suggested a working formula in which ten representatives from Assam would form their own constitution without joining any group and would merge with national committee to form the Indian constitution.

In 1947, Lord Mountbatten took over as new Viceroy. He held separate meetings with the Muslim League, Congress and Mahatma Gandhi. They decided to go for Partition as a permanent solution instead of grouping. India and Pakistan became separate independent countries.

Thus, Gopinath Bordoloi played a major role in securing the future of Assam which would have been included in East Pakistan otherwise.

==Contribution as Chief Minister==
After India&#x27;s Independence, he worked closely with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to secure the sovereignty of Assam against China on one hand and Pakistan on the other. He also helped to organise the rehabilitation of millions of Hindu refugees who had fled East Pakistan due to widespread violence and intimidation in the aftermath of Partition. His work formed the basis for ensuring communal harmony, democracy and stability which effectively kept Assam secure and progressive right up to the 1971 war over Bangladesh&#x27;s independence. He was instrumental in establishing Gauhati University, High Court of Assam, Assam Medical College, Assam Veterinary College, etc. Gopinath Bordoloi was also a gifted writer. He wrote several books like &quot;Annasaktiyog&quot;, &quot;Shreeramachandra&quot;, &quot;Hajrat Mohammad&quot;, and &quot;Budhhadeb&quot; while in jail. Throughout his life, he was a stern believer in Gandhian principles. He led a simple life in spite of being a Chief Minister. He died on 5 August 1950.

==Awards and recognition==
Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee conferred upon him the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1999. A life-size statue of Bordoloi was unveiled on 1 October 2002 in the Parliament House by the President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

<text>Ronald Neame CBE, BSC (23 April 1911 – 16 June 2010) was an English film producer, director, cinematographer, and screenwriter. Beginning his career as a cinematographer, for his work on the British war film &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1943) he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Special Effects. During a partnership with director David Lean, he produced &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), receiving two Academy Award nominations for writing.

Neame then moved into directing, and some notable films included, &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1956), which chronicled Operation Mincemeat, a British WWII deception operation, &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969), which won Maggie Smith her first Oscar, and the action-adventure disaster film &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972). He also directed &quot;I Could Go On Singing&quot; (1963), Judy Garland&#x27;s last film, and &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970), starring Albert Finney.

For his contributions to the film industry, in 1996 Neame was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest award the British Film Academy can give a filmmaker.

==Early career==
Born in Hendon, London, Neame was the son of photographer Elwin Neame and actress Ivy Close. He studied at University College School and Hurstpierpoint College. His father died in 1923, and Neame took a job with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as an office boy. Later, through his mother&#x27;s contacts in the British film industry, Neame started at Elstree Studios as a messenger boy.

He was fortunate enough to be hired as an assistant cameraman on &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), the first British talkie, directed by a young Alfred Hitchcock. Neame&#x27;s own career as a cinematographer began with the musical comedy &quot;Happy&quot; (1933), and he continued to develop his skills in various &quot;quota quickies&quot; films for several years.

His credits as cinematographer include &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941), &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), and &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot;. At the 15th Academy Awards, &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; won an Academy Honorary Award, and Neame was nominated for an Best Special Effects for his camerawork on &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing.

==As producer and screenwriter==

Following the success of &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;, director David Lean, associate producer Anthony Havelock-Allan, and cinematographer Neame formed a new production company together, Cineguild. Though the company only produced nine films between 1944 and 1950, it launched the directing careers of Lean and Neame and the producing career of Havelock-Allan.

The trio&#x27;s first three films were adaptations of Coward&#x27;s works: &quot;This Happy Breed&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, and &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;. All three films were Directed by Lean, shot by Neame, produced by Havelock-Allan, and co-written from all three. &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, which was adapted from Coward&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Still Life&quot;, earned all three partners an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination.

Following their success adapting Coward, the trio decided to adapt the works of Charles Dickens. Their screenplay for their first adaptation, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, earned the trio another Academy Award nomination. The film also marked an important shift in Neame&#x27;s career, as it was his first film on which he was not cinematographer. Instead, he served as a producer alongside Havelock-Allan. The next year, he made his directorial debut with &quot;Take My Life&quot;, again produced by Havelock-Allan.

Cineguild&#x27;s next film, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, was the beginning of the end for the production company. The film received criticism for antisemitism as a result of Alec Guinness&#x27; portrayal of Fagin. It was Havelock-Allan&#x27;s last film with the company. Neame produced one more film for Cineguild, Lean&#x27;s &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot;, before leaving to write, produce, and direct &quot;Golden Salamander&quot;. Lean&#x27;s next film, &quot;Madeleine&quot;, was Cineguild&#x27;s last, and the only Cineguild production without Neame or Havelock-Allan.

Following Cineguild&#x27;s dissolution, Neame produced &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (1951), a screen biography directed by John Boulting about the life of British camera inventor William Friese-Greene, which was the film project for the Festival of Britain.

==As director==
Neame made his directorial debut under the Cineguild banner, with &quot;Take My Life&quot; (1947), which was released by British producer J. Arthur Rank&#x27;s General Film Distributors in the United Kingdom in 1947 and by Rank&#x27;s Eagle-Lion Films in the United States in 1949. Neame began a transition to the American film industry at the suggestion of Rank, who asked him to study the Hollywood production system.

He worked again with Alec Guinness (whom he had worked with on &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;), this time as director, in three films: &quot;The Card&quot; (1952), &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot; (1958), and &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1960). Neame described &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; as &quot;the film I am proudest of&quot;. He received two BAFTA Award nominations for &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot;. Neame and Guinness worked again on the musical &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970) with Guinness playing the ghost of Jacob Marley to Albert Finney&#x27;s Ebenezer Scrooge.

Neame also directed &quot;I Could Go On Singing&quot; (1963), Judy Garland&#x27;s last film, co-starring Dirk Bogarde; and &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969), which won Maggie Smith her first Oscar.

Neame was recruited to direct &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972) after the contracted director left the production. He later characterised &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; as &quot;my favourite film&quot; because it earned him enough to retire comfortably. He enjoyed a long friendship with Walter Matthau, whom he directed in two later films, &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (1980) and &quot;First Monday in October&quot; (1981).

Neame&#x27;s final feature-length film, &quot;Foreign Body&quot;, a comedy starring Victor Banerjee, was filmed in England and released in 1986.

==Personal life==
Neame married Beryl Heanly in 1933. They legally separated in 1971 and divorced in 1992. She died in 1999. The couple had one son, Christopher, a writer/producer who died one year after his father&#x27;s death. Ronald&#x27;s only grandson, Gareth Neame, is a successful television producer, who represents the fourth generation of Neames in the film industry. Ronnie Neame&#x27;s second marriage took place in Santa Barbara on 12 September 1993. His wife, Donna Bernice Friedberg, is also in the business – a film researcher and television producer, who worked on his 1979 movie &quot;Meteor.&quot; He referred to their meeting as a &quot;&quot;coup de foudre&quot;.&quot;

In 1996 Neame was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and awarded the BAFTA Fellowship for his contributions to the film industry. He had homes in Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara, California. In 2003 Neame published an autobiography, &quot;Straight from the Horse&#x27;s Mouth.&quot; ()

==Death==
Neame died on 16 June 2010 after suffering complications from a broken leg. The break required two surgical procedures from which Neame never recovered.

In an interview in 2006, he jokingly stated, &quot;When people ask me about the secret to my longevity, I say the honest answer is two large vodkas at lunchtime and three large scotches in the evening. All my doctors have said to me, &#x27;Ronnie, if you would drink less, you&#x27;d live a lot longer.&#x27; But, they&#x27;re all dead, and I&#x27;m still here at 95.&quot;

<text>The Barb horse, also known as the Barbary horse (), is a breed of riding horse with historic roots in North Africa. Known for its hardiness and stamina, it has influenced a number of modern breeds, including many in northern and western Africa.

== Etymology ==
The first recorded use of the name &quot;Barb&quot; appears in the translation of the work Description of Africa by Hassan al-Wazzan (better known as Leo Africanus), which predates its adoption across Europe. The Barb horse breed derives its name from the Barbary Coast states, according to French historian Jean-Marie Lassère, who attributes the name to the tradition of naming animals based on their geographical origin. Jean-Louis Gouraud, on the other hand, connects the Barb to the Berbers (the European name for the &quot;Imazighen&quot;), stating that &quot;their histories and fates are inseparable&quot;. European sources also referred to this regional horse as &quot;Berber,&quot; in reference to a region known under Roman rule as &quot;Berberia&quot; or &quot;Barbaria&quot;. The term &quot;Berber&quot; is rooted in the ancient Greek word &quot;barbaros&quot;, a label the Romans used for non-Romans, especially the Numidians. Before this distinction, the term &quot;Barb horse&quot; was often synonymous with the Spanish Jennet or Zenata horse, referring to horses bred by the Moors (the European term for the conquerors of Al-Andalus) in the Iberian Peninsula.

== History ==
When imported to Europe, Barbs were sometimes mistaken for Arabians, although they have distinctly different physical characteristics. Europeans noted the similarities in size and appearance between the two breeds, particularly as both were handled by Berber Muslims who spoke Arabic. For instance, the Godolphin Arabian, one of the foundation sires of the Thoroughbred, was often referred to as the &quot;Godolphin Barb&quot; due to his origins in Tunisia, though his actual breed remains debated. Some sources argue that his conformation more closely resembled a high-quality Barb horse rather than an Arabian. Other notable Barb horses included the &quot;Curwen Barb&quot; and the &quot;Toulouse Barb&quot;, both influential in the early development of the Thoroughbred breed.

The Barb is now bred primarily in Algeria, Morocco, Spain and southern France. Due to difficult economic times in North Africa, the number of purebred Barbs is decreasing. The World Organization of the Barb Horse, founded in Algeria in 1987, was formed to promote and preserve the breed. In 2014, the International Equestrian Federation recognized the Barb horse as their Horse of Honor at the World Equestrian Games in Normandy.

=== Influence on other breeds ===
The Barb may have had more influence on the racing breeds throughout the world than any other horse except the Arabian. Berber invaders from North Africa took their horses, the forerunners of today&#x27;s Barbs, to Europe from the early eighth century onwards. Once established with settlers on the Iberian Peninsula, the Barb horse was bred with Spanish stock under 300 years of Umayyad patronage to develop the Andalusian (and the Lusitano). The Andalusian was highly prized and it was used for major development stock in horse breeding all over the world.

Historical references to &quot;Barbary&quot; horses include Roan Barbary, owned by King Richard II of England in the 14th century. The Barb horses were valued by other Europeans, including the Italians, whose noble families established large racing stables. During the 16th century, Henry VIII purchased a number of Barbary horses from Federico Gonzaga of Mantua, importing seven mares and a stallion. He continued to buy other Barbs and Andalusians. After the Royal Stables were sold off under Cromwell, private owners in England continued to value the Barbs and used them to develop the Thoroughbred. The influence of the Barb is also evident in the Argentinian Criollo, the Paso Fino, and many other Western Hemisphere breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, the Mustang and the Appaloosa.

Despite its importance as a progenitor of other breeds, the Barb is less renowned than the Arab, possibly because it was considered a less attractive-looking breed. In other important qualities, the Barb has the same stamina and endurance, the same ability to thrive on meager rations, and the same sure-footedness and speed over short distances. The Barb also was valued for its &quot;strong, short-coupled body, perfect for collection— the posture that makes weight-bearing easiest for the horse—its eagerness to learn and its gentle nature.&quot; Because of these characteristics, beginning in the 16th century, the horses were also trained for dressage, in Paris and other European capitals. Sixteenth-century and later portraits of royalty on horses frequently portrayed the latter in dressage positions.

<text>Get Ready to Be Boyzvoiced is a 2000 Norwegian mockumentary about a fictional boy band called Boyzvoice. Outside Norway, it has been screened multiple times on Australian television channel SBS.

==Plot==
The band is a three-piece vocal group dominated by their utterly untalented lead singer &quot;M*Pete&quot;. When they are caught lip-synching before the release of their first album, scandal erupts (fed also by their manager&#x27;s physically assaulting an elderly male and an elderly female member of the Salvation Army and the revelation that M*Pete&#x27;s 16-year-old girlfriend is actually only 12) and they are dropped by their record company. They consider leaving the music industry, but their manager gets them a sponsorship deal with a Norwegian fish finger manufacturer. Ultimately they bounce back to fame after an appearance at the HitAwards Norwegian music awards show.

<text>The Lusitano, also known as the Pure Blood Lusitano or PSL (&quot;Puro Sangue Lusitano&quot;), is a Portuguese horse breed. Horses were known to be present on the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 20,000 BC, and by 800 BC the region was renowned for its war horses. The fame of the horses from Lusitania goes back to the Roman Age, which attributed its speed to the influence of the West wind, who was considered capable of fertilizing the mares. When the Muslims invaded Iberia in 711 AD, they brought Arabian horses with them that were crossed with the native horses, developing a horse that became useful for war, dressage and bull fighting. The Portuguese horse was named the Lusitano, after the word Lusitania, the ancient Roman name for the region that modern Portugal occupies. There are four main breed lineages within the breed today, and characteristics differ slightly between each line.

Lusitanos can be any solid color, although they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always brown. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile and elevated movement. Originally bred for war, dressage and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games as part of the Portuguese and Spanish dressage teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles.

==History==
Horses were known to humans on what is now the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 25,000 to 20,000 BC, as shown by cave paintings in the area. Among the local wild horses originally used by humans were the probable ancestors of the modern Lusitano, as studies comparing ancient and modern horse DNA indicate that the modern &quot;Lusitano C&quot; group contains maternal lineages also present in wild Iberian horses from the Early Neolithic period. These ancient horses were used for war, with clear evidence of their use by Phoenicians around 1100 BC and Celts around 600 BC. It is believed that these invaders also brought horses with them, contributing outside blood to the ancestry of the modern Iberian breeds. By 800 BC, the alliance known as Celtiberians had been formed by the Iberians and Celts, and from this point on the horses bred in this area were renowned as war horses. Xenophon, writing around 370 BC, admired the advanced horsemanship and riding techniques used by Iberian horsemen in war, made possible in part by their agile horses. Legend claimed that mares of the area were sired by the wind (hence their amazing swiftness, passed onto their foals), and one modern hypothesis suggests that the bond between Iberian humans and horses was the initial inspiration for the centaur, which was believed to come from the area of the Tagus River. Later invasions into the area by Carthaginians and Romans resulted in these civilizations establishing stud farms that bred cavalry horses for the Roman army from local stock.

When the Umayyad Muslims invaded the Iberian peninsula in 711 AD, their invasion brought Barb horses, which were crossed with native Iberian horses. The cross between these two breeds produced a war horse superior even to the original Iberian horse, and it was this new type that the Conquistadors introduced to the Americas. Called the Iberian war horse, this ancestor of the Lusitano was used both on the battlefield and in major riding academies throughout Europe. Bullfighting on horseback and displays of high school dressage were common entertainment for the Portuguese gentry.

Mitochondrial DNA studies of the closely related modern Andalusian horse, compared to the Barb horse of North Africa, present convincing evidence that Barbs and Iberian horses crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in each direction, were crossbred with each other, and thus each influenced the other&#x27;s maternal bloodlines. While Portuguese historian Ruy d&#x27;Andrade hypothesized that the ancient Sorraia breed was an ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds, including the Lusitano, genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA show that the Sorraia is part of a genetic cluster that is largely separated from most Iberian breeds. One maternal lineage is shared with the Lusitano, however, Sorraia lineages in Iberian breeds are relatively recent, dating to the Middle Ages, making the Sorraia an unlikely prehistoric ancestor of the Lusitano.

Prior to modern times, horse breeds throughout Europe were known primarily by the name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only difference is the country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, horses moved continually between Spain and Portugal, and horses from the studs of Andalusia were used to improve the Portuguese cavalry. Portugal&#x27;s successful restoration war against Spain (1640–1668) was in part based on mounted troops riding war horses of Spanish blood. During the reign of Philip III of Portugal (also Philip IV of Spain), Portuguese horse breeding reached its lowest point. The Spanish passed laws to halt the country&#x27;s production of cavalry horses, and what stud farms did exist were run in secrecy with horses smuggled or stolen from Spain. These secret farms, however, provided the base for the modern Lusitano. In 1662, when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza of Portugal, the royal dowry included Portugal&#x27;s Tangier and Bombay garrisons. These garrisons included large groups of Portuguese cavalry, mounted on Iberian horses.

Prior to the 1960s, the Iberian-type horse was called the Andalusian in both Portugal and Spain. In 1966, the Lusitano name was adopted by Portugal after a studbook separation by the two countries. The revolutions of Portugal&#x27;s African colonies resulted in the near economic collapse of Portugal. The landed class attracted political agitators, estates were vacated, and stud farms were broken up and their horses sold to Spain. However, the best lines were saved through the efforts of breeders, and breeding soon increased. Today, Lusitanos are bred mainly in Portugal and Brazil, but maintain a presence in many other countries throughout the world, including Australia, the United States, Great Britain, South Africa, and other European countries. Crossbred horses of partial Lusitano blood are popular, especially when crossed with Andalusian, Arabian or Thoroughbred blood.

===Strains and sub-types===

The Portuguese stud book recognizes six horses (five stallions and one mare) that are called the &quot;heads of lineage&quot;. These six horses are the foundation horses of the three main breed lineages: Andrade, Veiga and Coudelaria Nacional (Portuguese State Stud). Although each line meets breed standards, they differ from each other in individual characteristics. The six foundation horses are:

*Agareno, a 1931 Veiga stallion, out of Bagocha, by Lidador
*Primorosa, a 1927 Dominquez Hermanos stallion, out of Primorosa II, by Presumido
*Destinado, a 1930 Dominquez Hermanos stallion, out of Destinada, by Alegre II
*Marialva II, a 1930 Antonio Fontes Pereira de Melo stallion, out of Campina, by Marialva
*Regedor, a 1923 Alter Real stallion, out of Gavina, by Gavioto
*Hucharia, a 1943 Coudelaria Nacional mare, out of Viscaina, by Cartujano

==== Alter Real ====
The Alter Real is a strain of the Lusitano which is bred only at the Alter Real State Stud in Portugal. The stud was founded in 1748 by the Portuguese royal family to provide horses for the national riding academy and royal use. The Portuguese School of Equestrian Art (Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre) uses these horses exclusively in their performances. The strain was developed from 300 Iberian mares imported from Spain in 1747. When Napoleon invaded Spain in the early 19th century, the Alter Real strain deteriorated due to the introduction of Arabian, Thoroughbred, Spanish-Norman and Hanoverian blood. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries the strain was re-established with the further introduction of Spanish blood.

In the early 20th century, with the 1910 revolution that ended the monarchy, the Alter Real strain faced extinction, as records were burned, stallions were gelded and the stud discontinued. Ruy d&#x27;Andrade, a specialist in Iberian horse breeds, saved two stallions and several mares, and was able to re-establish the strain, turning his herd over to the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture in 1942, when the stud was reopened. The Portuguese state has maintained ownership of the stud, and continues to produce horses for use in high school dressage.

==Registration==

Today, outside of Portugal and Spain, breeding, showing and registration of both Lusitanos and Andalusians are often closely linked. One example is the Australasian Lusitano Horse Association of Australasia (LHAA), which shares responsibility for the Purebred Iberian Horse (an Andalusian/Lusitano cross) with the Australasia Andalusian Association, as well as hosting a combined National Show for the two breeds in Australia. The LHAA was formed in 2003 to register and promote the Lusitano breed in Australia and New Zealand, and in June 2005 signed an agreement with their parent organization, the Portuguese Associação Portuguesa de Criadores do Cavalo Puro Sangue Lusitano, to follow that association&#x27;s rules and regulations. The LHAA maintains two studbooks (for the purebred Lusitano and the purebred Iberian) and a crossbred registry for horses with one Lusitano parent. An example of a combined registry is the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA).

==Characteristics and uses==
Lusitanos are generally gray, bay or chestnut, though they can be of any solid color, including black, buckskin and palomino. Only bays are bred at the Alter Real stud. They usually stand high, although some stand over . Members of the breed have narrow, but well-proportioned, heads with profiles that are slightly convex. The necks are thick and arched, leading to well defined withers, shoulders that are muscular and sloping and a deep, broad chest. The horses have short, strong backs and rounded, sloped croups, leading to a low-set tail. The legs are sturdy and muscled. Lusitanos are known as powerful horses, noted for their intelligence and willing nature. The breed&#x27;s gaits are agile and elevated, but generally comfortable to ride. The Lusitano differs from the Andalusian through having a more sloped croup, a lower-set tail, and a more convex head profile. The mane and tail are extremely thick in both breeds.

The ancestors of the Lusitano were originally used for classical dressage, driving and bullfighting on horseback. Today, Lusitanos are seen in internationdisciplines, including high-level combined driving competition. In 1995, a four-in-hand team driven by Belgian Felix Brasseur won the FEI Driving World Cup, and took the World Championships in 1996. In 2002, there was a Lusitano on the World Equestrian Games bronze-winning dressage team that went on to collect a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2006, the entire Portuguese dressage team rode Lusitanos at the World Equestrian Games, as did one Spanish dressage competitor. The Belgian Brasseur took the gold medal in four-in-hand driving at the same competition with a team composed solely of Lusitanos.

They are still used for mounted bullfighting today, in a form where the bull is not killed and it is considered a disgrace to the rider if the horse is injured. Horses bred for this sport must be agile and calm, remaining in the control of the rider even when confronted by a bull. Between 1980 and 1987, Lusitanos were used for breeding Colorado Ranger horses, although these crosses are no longer allowed by the breed registry. An Alter Real stallion, taken to Brazil prior to Napoleon&#x27;s invasion, was a foundation stallion of the Mangalarga Marchador breed.

<doc id="1310631" wikidata="Q1043259" url="?curid=1310631" title="Carlos Spencer">
<text>Carlos James Spencer (born 14 October 1975) is a former New Zealand rugby union player and previously the head coach of the and the . He is currently an assistant coach for the New Orleans Gold of Major League Rugby (MLR).

During his playing days, he played at fly-half (first five-eighth) for the Blues and Lions in Super Rugby and for New Zealand internationally.

==Provincial and club career==
He generally specialised in the position of fly-half, also known as &quot;first five-eighth&quot; or &quot;number 10&quot;, although he also played fullback (number 15) at national and international levels.

Spencer first rose to prominence when he starred alongside Christian Cullen in a Ranfurly Shield challenge in 1994, playing for the Horowhenua team against Auckland. Auckland coach Graham Henry spotted Spencer&#x27;s talent and recruited him to play for the Auckland team.

He played for the Blues Super 12 team from the inception of the competition in 1996 until 2005, and for the Auckland NPC side.

In 1996, Spencer played for the Blues in the first ever Super 12-match, kicking off the professional era of rugby union. He went on to score 608 points for the Blues in the Super Rugby competition.

In 2005, he signed to the English club, Northampton Saints, where he stayed until 30 January 2009. On 3 February 2009, he signed for Gloucester on a 17-month contract.

In January 2010, Spencer signed with the Johannesburg-based Golden Lions, to play for the team in the 2010 and 2011 Super Rugby seasons. The contract offered to him was said at the time to be the highest ever in South Africa. He subsequently took up a coaching role with the team, before being released following the 2012 season. He moved to the Durban-based for the 2013 season.

In December 2013, he signed a five-year contract to become the kicking and specialist skills coach at Port Elizabeth-based side, the . He was appointed as their head coach on 20 February 2014. He was in charge for just one Currie Cup season, 2014, where they achieved just one victory in ten matches. Brent Janse van Rensburg was appointed as head coach for the 2015 Currie Cup Premier Division season with Spencer reverting to kicking and specialist skills coach. However, Spencer left the coaching staff a month later.

==International career==
Spencer first played for the All Blacks in a non-test tour match on 4 November 1995, but did not play his first test match until 1997. His test debut was against Argentina at Athletic Park in Wellington on 21 June that year. He scored 33 points in that match alone.

His All Black appearances as a starter were somewhat irregular thereafter, as Andrew Mehrtens was generally preferred as the first-choice flyhalf for the side during the period from 1995 to 2002. He was selected for the 1999 All Blacks World Cup squad but became injured in training at London, so did not play a match in that tournament. However, following an exceptional season for the Blues in Super 12, Spencer became first-choice first five-eighth for the All Blacks in 2003, and was a part of the squad for the Rugby World Cup that year.

In 2004, Carlos Spencer struggled to find the same form he had displayed the previous year, and Mehrtens replaced him for the final game of that year&#x27;s Tri Nations. He was then ruled out of the final All Black tour of the year through injury. In 2005, Spencer lost form early in the Super 12 competition and then suffered a fractured cheekbone in training. He agreed to play for the New Zealand Māori (in his 10th match for that team) against the touring Lions, but made himself unavailable for the All Blacks so that he would not miss training for his new English club, Northampton Saints.

As a player, Spencer was valued for his imaginative kicking and passing game, and his ability to unlock defences. He was also a handy, if not entirely reliable, goal kicker. Only five players have scored more test points than Spencer for New Zealand — Daniel Carter 1,598, Andrew Mehrtens 967, Grant Fox 645, Beauden Barrett 465, and most recently, Aaron Cruden 322.

==Boxing==
On 3 December 2011, Spencer stepped into the boxing ring against Rugby league&#x27;s Awen Guttenbeil in Fight for Life 2011 in Auckland, New Zealand. The fight was controversially ruled a draw despite Spencer knocking down Guttenbeil with seconds remaining on the last round.

==Awards and honours==
In 2006, Spencer was named in the Guinness Premiership Awards Dream Team and collected the Player of the Year award for the 2005–06 season at the Northampton Saints annual awards, as voted for by the club&#x27;s fans. He played in four matches for Bob Dwyer&#x27;s World XV team in 2006, including a match for the Barbarians against England at Twickenham on 28 May and a 30–27 loss to the Springboks at Ellis Park on 3 June.

==Personal life==
He married Jodene Spencer. Their son Payton Spencer is an international rugby player for New Zealand Sevens. His daughter, Asha is 16 as of 2024.

== Match Fit ==
Spencer made his debut for Match Fit: Union vs. League.In 2024, he made his debut with Paul Whatuira and Louis Anderson in Match Fit: Union vs. League. Whatuira also beat Spencer in a charity Fight For Life boxing match. Spencer and Pita Alatini both maxed out the metabolic age potential to -15 against their biological ages. Despite this: It was revealed that both he and Louis Anderson have a family history of high blood cholesterol despite having lower metabolic age than biological age and are two of the fittest in the group. At the final weigh in, however, he also gained the perfect score for percentage of visceral fat for males at 4%.

Mentally: He had polarized the nation as he was one of the first ball-dominant fly halves in New Zealand, playing more like a scrum half than a first five-eighth. He was also never known as a reliable kicker, which is an expected role of a traditional first five-eighth. Due to his playstyle and his competitiveness, he shut down when things don&#x27;t go well rather than risking an angry vent. He also received online and media abuse against him. During the IronMaori&#x27;s triathlon, he covered for Paul Miller as a biker (with Frank Bunce)and runner (with Pita Alatini). He led the Union team to beat Team League in triathlon.

<text>commonly abbreviated as Nintendo EAD and formerly known as Nintendo Research &amp; Development No.4 Department (abbreviated as Nintendo R&amp;D4), was the largest software development division within the Japanese video game company Nintendo. It was preceded by the &quot;Creative Department&quot;, a team of designers with backgrounds in art responsible for many different tasks, to which Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka originally belonged. Both served as managers of the EARD studios and were credited in every game developed by the division, with varying degrees of involvement. Nintendo EAD was best known for its work on games in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;F-Zero&quot;, &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, &quot;Pikmin&quot;, and &quot;Wii&quot; series.

Following a large company restructuring after the death of company president Satoru Iwata, the division merged with Nintendo&#x27;s Software Planning &amp; Development division in September 2015, becoming Nintendo Entertainment Planning &amp; Development.

==History==
===Background===
During the 1970s, when Nintendo was still predominantly a toy company, it decided to expand into interactive entertainment and the video game industry. Several designers were hired to work under the Creative Department, which, at the time, was the only game development department within Nintendo. Among these new designers were Makoto Kano, who went on to design various Game &amp; Watch games, and Shigeru Miyamoto, who would create various Nintendo franchises. In 1972, the department was renamed to Research &amp; Development Department; it had about 20 employees. The department was later consolidated into a division and separated into three groups, Nintendo R&amp;D1, R&amp;D2 and R&amp;D3.

===1980–1989: Creation as Research &amp; Development 4===
Circa 1984, Hiroshi Imanishi oversaw the creation of Research &amp; Development No. 4 Department (commonly abbreviated to Nintendo R&amp;D4), as a new development department dedicated to developing video games for dedicated consoles, complementing the other three existing departments in the Nintendo Manufacturing Division. Imanishi appointed Hiroshi Ikeda, a former anime director at Toei Animation, as general manager of the newly created department, and Miyamoto as its chief producer, who would later become one of the most recognized video game developers in the world. Nintendo also drafted a couple of key graphic designers to the department including Takashi Tezuka and Kenji Miki. With the arcade market dwindling, Nintendo R&amp;D1&#x27;s former focus, the department concentrated most of their software development resources on the emerging handheld video game console market, primarily thanks to the worldwide success of Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy. This catapulted the R&amp;D4 department to become the lead software developer for Nintendo home video game consoles, developing a myriad of games for the Family Computer home console (abbreviated to Famicom, known as the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America, Europe, and Australia).

Hiroshi Ikeda&#x27;s creative team had many video game design ideas but was lacking the necessary programming power to make it all happen. Toshihiko Nakago, and his small company Systems Research &amp; Development (SRD), had its expertise in computer-aided design (CAD) tools and was very familiar with the Famicom chipset, and was originally hired to work with Masayuki Uemura&#x27;s Nintendo R&amp;D2 to internally develop software development kits. When Nintendo R&amp;D2 and SRD jointly began porting over R&amp;D1 arcade games to the Famicom, Shigeru Miyamoto took the opportunity to lure Nakago away from R&amp;D2, to help Miyamoto create his first Nintendo R&amp;D4 video game, &quot;Excitebike&quot;. And so the original R&amp;D4 department became composed of Miyamoto, Takashi Tezuka, Kenji Miki, and Minoru Maeda handling design; Koji Kondo, Akito Nakatsuka, and Hirokazu Tanaka handling sound design; and Toshihiko Nakago and SRD became the technology and programming core.

The same Miyamoto-led team that developed &quot;Excitebike&quot; went on to develop a 1985 NES port of the scrolling beat &#x27;em up arcade game &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984) called &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Miyamoto&#x27;s team used the technical knowledge they had gained from working on both side-scrollers to further advance the platforming &quot;athletic game&quot; genre they had created with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and were key steps towards Miyamoto&#x27;s vision of an expansive side-scrolling platformer.

One of the first games developed by the R&amp;D4 department was &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; in 1983, designed and directed by Miyamoto. The department was, however, unable to program the game with such an inexperienced team, and so counted on programming assistance from Gunpei Yokoi and the R&amp;D1 department. One of the first completely self-developed games was &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; The game set standards for the platform genre, and went on to be both a critical and commercial success. In 1986, R&amp;D4 developed &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, for which Miyamoto again served as a director. The phenomenal sales of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; fueled the expansion of the department with young game designers such as Hideki Konno, Katsuya Eguchi, Kensuke Tanabe, Takao Shimizu, who would later become producers themselves.

===1989–2002: Renamed to Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development===
In 1989, one year before the Super Famicom was released in Japan, the R&amp;D4 department was spun-off and made its own division named &quot;Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development&quot; (commonly abbreviated as &quot;Nintendo EAD&quot;). The division was comprised into two departments: the &quot;Software Development Department&quot;, which focused on video game development and was led by Miyamoto, and the Technology Development Department, which focused on programming and developing tools and was led by Takao Sawano. The technology department was born out of several R&amp;D2 engineers that were assisting SRD with software libraries. After that, the same department later collaborated with Argonaut Software to develop the Super FX chip technology for the SNES, first used in &quot;Star Fox&quot; in 1993. This venture allowed the Technology Development Department to become more prominent in the 3D era, where they programmed several of Nintendo EAD&#x27;s 3D games with SRD.

F-Zero, released in 1990, was the first video game fully programmed at the division. Prior to that, most programming was outsourced to SRD Co. Ltd.
In 1997, Miyamoto explained that about twenty to thirty employees were devoted to each Nintendo EAD title during the course of its development. It was then that he also disclosed the existence of the SRD programming company within the division, formally Nintendo R&amp;D2&#x27;s software unit, which was composed of about 200 employees with proficiency in software programming.
In the advent of launching both the GameCube and Game Boy Advance, Nintendo sought to change the structure of its corporate management. In June 2000, in an attempt to include both software and hardware experts in the board of directors, EAD and Integrated Research &amp; Development general managers, Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda respectively, entered the body. In addition, former HAL Laboratory president and future Nintendo president, Satoru Iwata, also entered the board. With Miyamoto being promoted to the board of directors, he was now in charge of overseeing all of Nintendo&#x27;s software development. To fill Miyamoto&#x27;s void as a producer, there were a series of promotions in the division: starting with long-time Miyamoto colleague Takashi Tezuka, as deputy general manager, as well as promoting several senior directors like Eiji Aonuma, Hideki Konno, Takao Shimizu, Tadashi Sugiyama and Katsuya Eguchi to producers overseeing their own development teams in the division. Nevertheless, after the promotion, Miyamoto still went on to produce some games.
In 2002, Nintendo opened a Nintendo EAD studio in Tokyo, appointing Takao Shimizu as manager of the branch. The studio was created with the goal of bringing in fresh new talent from the capital of Japan who wouldn&#x27;t be willing or able to travel to Kyoto. Their first project was &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; for the GameCube which made use of the DK Bongos, initially created for &quot;Donkey Konga&quot;.

===2003–2015: Restructure, new managers, and merger with SPD===
On September 30, 2003, as a result of a corporate restructure Nintendo was undergoing, in which several members of the Nintendo R&amp;D1 and R&amp;D2 were reassigned under Nintendo EAD, the department was consolidated into a division and began welcoming a new class of managers and producers. Hideki Konno, Katsuya Eguchi, Eiji Aonuma, Hiroyuki Kimura, and Tadashi Sugiyama were appointed project managers of their own groups within the Software Development Department; Shimizu was appointed project manager of the Tokyo Software Development Department, and Keizo Ota and Yasunari Nishida were appointed project managers of their own groups in the Technology Development Department.

In 2013, Katsuya Eguchi was promoted Department Manager of both Software Development Departments in Kyoto and Tokyo. As such, he left his role as Group Manager of &quot;Software Development Group No. 2&quot;, and was replaced by Hisashi Nogami. On June 18, 2014, the EAD Kyoto branch was moved from the Nintendo Central Office to the &quot;Nintendo Development Center&quot; in Kyoto. The building housed more than 1100 developers from all of Nintendo&#x27;s internal research and development divisions, which included the Nintendo EAD, SPD, IRD and SDD divisions. On September 16, 2015, EAD merged with Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development to establish Entertainment Planning &amp; Development (EPD). The move followed an internal restructuring of Nintendo executives and departments after the death of president Satoru Iwata in July 2015.

==Structure==

The Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development division was headed by Nintendo-veteran Takashi Tezuka who acted as general manager. The division was divided in two development departments: one in Kyoto, with Katsuya Eguchi acting as its deputy general manager; and one in Tokyo, with Yoshiaki Koizumi acting as its deputy general manager.

===Kyoto Software Development Department===

The Nintendo EAD Kyoto &quot;Software Development Department&quot; was the largest and one of the oldest research and development departments within Nintendo, housing more than 700 video game developers. It was located in Kyoto, Japan, formerly in the &quot;Nintendo Central Office&quot;, but on June 28, 2014, it was relocated to the new &quot;Nintendo Development Center&quot;, which housed all of Nintendo&#x27;s internal research and development divisions.

The development department integrated Nintendo&#x27;s most notable producers: Hideki Konno, producer of the &quot;Nintendogs&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series; Katsuya Eguchi, producer of the &quot;Wii&quot; and &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series; Eiji Aonuma, producer of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series; Hiroyuki Kimura, producer &quot;Big Brain Academy&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Pikmin&quot; series; and Tadashi Sugiyama, producer of the &quot;Wii Fit&quot;, &quot;Steel Diver&quot; and &quot;Star Fox&quot; series.

The department was managed by veteran Nintendo game designer Katsuya Eguchi. As such, Hisashi Nogami later succeeded him as the producer of the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; franchise and was responsible for the creation of the &quot;Splatoon&quot; series.

===Technology Development Department===
===Tokyo Software Development Department===
The Nintendo EAD &quot;Tokyo Software Development Department&quot; was created in 2002 with the goal of bringing in fresh new talent from the capital of Japan who wouldn&#x27;t be willing to travel hundreds of miles away to Kyoto. It is located in Tokyo, Japan, in the Nintendo Tokyo Office.

In 2003, twenty members of the Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development Division in Kyoto volunteered to relocate to Nintendo&#x27;s Tokyo Office to expand development resources. These twenty volunteers were primarily from the Super Mario Sunshine team. Management saw it as a good opportunity to expand and recruit several developers who were more comfortable living in Tokyo than relocating to Kyoto.

Takao Shimizu (original manager and producer) and Yoshiaki Koizumi (director) began hiring several recruits in Tokyo coming from several established companies like SEGA, Koei, and Square-Enix. Shimizu and Koizumi jointly spearheaded their first project, &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot;. This was followed in 2007 by the release of the critically and commercially acclaimed &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;. After the release of &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, Koizumi was promoted to manager and producer and officially opened Tokyo Software Development Group No. 2.

The Tokyo group had veteran game developer Katsuya Eguchi as its general manager, who also oversaw development operations for the Kyoto Software Development Department.

<text>Louis Ralph &quot;Bud&quot; Sherman (December 24, 1926 – January 9, 2015) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the House of Commons of Canada during the 1960s and was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1984, serving as a cabinet minister in the government of Sterling Lyon.

==Early life and education==
The son of Louis Ralph Sherman, archbishop of Rupert&#x27;s Land, and Caroline Zerelda Gillmor, Sherman was born in Quebec City, Quebec. He was educated at the University of Manitoba. He served with the Canadian Officers&#x27; Training Corps in 1947–49, graduating as a first lieutenant. Subsequently, he worked as a broadcaster, journalist, and newspaper editor. In 1955, Sherman married Elizabeth Ann Beaton.

==Career==
In the 1965 Canadian federal election, Sherman was elected to the House of Commons for the riding of Winnipeg South as a Progressive Conservative, defeating Liberal incumbent Margaret Konantz by about 3,000 votes (Sidney Green of the New Democratic Party came a strong third). Sherman served as an opposition MP for the two and a half years of the 27th Canadian Parliament, under leaders John Diefenbaker, Michael Starr and Robert Stanfield, before losing his seat to high-profile Liberal candidate James Richardson by over 8,000 votes in the 1968 federal election. Following his defeat, he wrote a regular column in the &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot;.

He was first elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating his NDP opponent by more than 1,500 votes in the riding of Fort Garry, which was then just south of Winnipeg. The NDP formed a minority government after the election, and Sherman again sat as an opposition member. In 1973, he was narrowly re-elected over Liberal candidate Henry Janzen.

Sherman was re-elected by a much greater margin in the 1977 election, in which the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Sterling Lyon (who, coincidentally, had represented Fort Garry before Sherman). On October 24, 1977, Sherman was appointed Minister of Health and Social Development, with responsibility for corrections and rehabilitation. In October 1978, the name of his portfolio was changed to Health and Community Services. On November 15, 1979, Sherman&#x27;s title was again changed to &quot;Minister of Health&quot;, and he retained the position for the remainder of the Lyon government&#x27;s time in office. Sherman also served as chairman of the Community Services Committee of cabinet from October 20, 1978 to the resignation of the Lyon government on November 30, 1981.

The NDP under Howard Pawley formed a majority in the provincial election of 1981, although Sherman was easily re-elected in his own riding. He served as deputy leader of the provincial Conservatives until he resigned his seat to run for the Canadian House of Commons again in the 1984 federal election. Earlier in 1984, federal Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney warned Sherman and other Tories that they must support French language rights of minorities outside Quebec to run as PC candidates. Sherman had previously questioned French-language rights in Manitoba. In the 1984 federal election, he lost to Liberal incumbent Lloyd Axworthy in the riding of Winnipeg—Fort Garry by just over 2,000 votes. At the time of the election, Sherman listed his profession as &quot;health-care consultant&quot;.

Sherman did not seek a return to politics since this time. He later served as vice chairman of the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and was partly responsible for developing CRTC policy concerning changes in Canadian telecommunications with the growth of the Internet and broadband services. He retired from the position in 1995.

==Later life and death==
Sherman supported Conservative candidate Raj Joshi in the riding of Winnipeg South Centre in the 2004 federal election.

In December 2004, he was elected to the board of directors of the Manitoba Major Soccer League. He died at the age of 88 on January 9, 2015, in Winnipeg.

<text>Many nations continue to research and/or stockpile chemical weapon agents despite numerous efforts to reduce or eliminate them. Most states have joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which required the destruction of all chemical weapons by 2012. Twelve nations have declared chemical weapons production facilities and six nations have declared stockpiles of chemical weapons. All of the declared production facilities have been destroyed or converted for civilian use after the treaty went into force.

==CWC states with declared stockpiles==
Of the 193 nations that have signed the CWC, states listed below have also declared stockpiles and agreed to monitored disposal and verification. In some cases, chemical weapons were used in conflict. Both military targets and civilian populations have been affected. , only North Korea is confirmed to have remaining stockpiles of chemical weapons. 
* Iraq
* Japan
* Libya
* Russia
* Syria
* United States

== Details by state ==
===Albania===

Albania, as a party of the Chemical Weapons Convention, declared a stockpile of 16 tons of chemical weapons in 2007. On July 11, 2007, with the help of the U.S. government&#x27;s Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the Ministry of Defence announced the successful destruction of the entire stockpile.

===Angola===
Angola has been accused of using chemical weapons in its civil war.

===China===
According to the testimony from Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research Carl W. Ford before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, it is very probable that China has an advanced chemical warfare program. This includes research and development, production, and weaponization capabilities. The United States is concerned by China&#x27;s contact and willingness to share chemical weapons expertise with other states of proliferating concern, including Syria and Iran. Chinese government did declare that they had a small arsenal of chemical weapons in the past but that it was destroyed before the ratifying convention. They declared only two former chemical production facilities that may have produced mustard gas and Lewisite.

===Cuba===

According to a United Nations finding, that cited suspicious residue affecting plant and animal life during the Cuban intervention in Angola, sarin and VX was used against Angolan militants by the Cuban Army.

===Egypt===
Egypt did not sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and has been appearing on various lists as having an offensive chemical weapons capability and is thought to have production facilities for sarin, VX, mustard gas and phosgene. Before the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979, the country played a pivotal role exporting chemical weapons and related technologies to other Arab countries. It is possible that Egypt may still have limited stockpiles of chemical bombs, rockets and shells.

There are numerous reasons for this belief:
* Egypt is known to have used mustard gas in the Yemen civil war from 1963 to 1967.
* In the 1970s, Syria got their first chemical weapons from Egypt during the Yom Kippur War, but they were never used in this conflict.
* In the 1980s, Egypt supplied Iraq with mustard gas and nerve agents as well as related production and deployment technology.

In testimony before the Subcommittee on Seapower: Strategic and Critical Materials in 1991, US Navy Rear Admiral Thomas Brooks cited this evidence in identifying Egypt as a &quot;probable&quot; country to have chemical weapons.

Recent analyses are more careful estimating the current status of a chemical weapons program in Egypt. Only one facility has been identified as &quot;likely involved&quot; in the offensive activities. Although the offensive program may be still in existence, it does not seem that Egypt has a considerable stockpile of operational weapons. 

===Ethiopia===
In 1991 Rear Admiral Thomas Brooks identified Ethiopia before congress as a &quot;probability&quot; to have chemical weapons possession. Ethiopia did ratify with the CWC in 1996 and did not declare an offensive CW program. From that time no evidence has been presented to contradict this statement.

===India===
On January 14, 1993, India became one of the original nations to sign the CWC. India declared its stock of chemical weapons in June 1997 which included 1044 tonnes of sulfur mustard in their possession.

In 2005, of the six nations that declared stockpiles of chemical weapons, India was the only one to meet their deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons and inspection of its facilities by the OPCW. By the end of 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons and material stockpile. They were granted an extension to destroy the remainder until April 2009. Hopes was that India would destroy 100 percent within that time frame. On May 14, 2009, India informed the United Nations that they had completely destroyed their stockpile of chemical weapons.

===Iran===
Near the end of the Iran–Iraq War, Iran was suspected to have made limited use of chemical weapons in response to multiple chemical attacks by Iraq. The delivery vehicles Iran supposedly had in their possession included artillery shells, mortars, rockets and aerial bombs.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C.–based think tank, Iran currently has at least two major facilities for the research and production of chemical weapons. Iran began their production of nerve agents no later than 1994. The accuracy of these claims has not been verified.

Iran signed the Chemical Weapons Convention on January 13, 1993, and ratified it on November 3, 1997. They deny allegations of having a clandestine CW program in violation of CWC. In the official declaration submitted to OPCW, the Iranian government admitted that it produced mustard gas in 1980s but ceased the offensive program and destroyed stockpiles of operational weapons after the end of the war with Iraq.

===Iraq===
Well before Operation Desert Storm or the U.N. inspections that followed it, Iraq had already begun to build chemical weapons. After launching a research effort in the 1970s, Iraq was able to use chemical weapons in their war against Iran and to kill large numbers of their own Kurdish population in the 1980s. On June 28, 1987, in Sardasht, during two separate attacks on four residential areas, an estimated as 10 civilians were killed and 650 civilians injured. Iraq used an excessive amount of chemical weapons during Iran–Iraq War. Kurdish people were victims of chemical weapons. Iraq used mustard gas in an attack against Kurdish people on March 16, 1988, during the Halabja chemical attack. The attack killed between 3,200 and 5,000 people and injured 7,000 to 10,000 more, most of them civilians. During Iraqi chemical attacks against Iran, many Iranian military forces were killed by nerve agents. At the time, the attacks were actively supported by the United States.

During the first Gulf War, there were fears that Iraq would launch chemical-tipped missiles at its neighbors, particularly Israel, but Iraq refrained for fear of U.S. retaliation. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, coalition troops again feared they might be hit with chemical weapons, though this did not happen.

In 1991, as part of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire agreement, the United Nations passed Resolution 687 that established the Special Commission (UNSCOM). The UNSCOM was charged with the task of destroying, removing or rendering harmless &quot;all chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research, development, support and manufacturing facilities.&quot;

By the time UNSCOM left Iraq in December 1998, it had destroyed a large portion of Iraq&#x27;s chemical weapon potential. UNSCOM had overseen the destruction or incapacitation of more than 88,000 filled or unfilled chemical munitions, over 600 tons of weaponized or bulk chemical agents, 4,000 tons of precursor chemicals, 980 pieces of key production equipment and 300 pieces of analytical equipment. Notwithstanding these extraordinary achievements, the uncertainties regarding Iraq&#x27;s possession of chemical weapons, their precursors and munitions remain.

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that oversee destruction measures, announced that &quot;The government of Iraq has deposited their accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention with the Secretary General of the United Nations and within 30 days, on 12 February 2009, will become the 186th State to the Convention&quot;. Iraq also declared stockpiles of CW. Because of their recent accession, will be the only State Party exempted from the destruction time-line. On September 7, 2011, Hoshyar Zebari entered the OPCW headquarters, becoming the first Iraqi Foreign Minister to officially visit since the country joined the CWC.

===Israel===
In 2015, Israel signed but did not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. According to the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service, Israel has significant stores of chemical weapons they manufactured themselves. They have a highly developed chemical and petrochemical industry, skilled specialists and stocks of source material. They are capable of producing several nerve, blister and incapacitating weapons. A 2005 report from the Swedish Defence Research Agency concluded that Israel is probably not actively producing &quot;traditional&quot; chemical weapons but may have a functional stockpile of previously produced material. Assessment of Israeli chemical weapons capabilities were redacted from declassified U.S. documents.

Although Israel did sign the CWC, they have not ratified the treaty and therefore is not officially bound by its tenets. Beliefs are that Israel has a significant stockpile of chemical weapons, likely to be the most abundant in the Middle-East according to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. A 1983 CIA report stated that Israel, after &quot;finding itself surrounded by front-line Arab states with budding chemical weapon capabilities, became increasingly conscious of its vulnerability to chemical attack ... undertook a program of chemical warfare preparations in both offensive and protective areas ... In late 1982, a probable CW nerve agent production facility and a storage facility were identified at the Dimona Sensitive Storage Area in the Negev Desert. Other CW agent production is believed to exist within a well-developed Israeli chemical industry.&quot;

In 1974, in a hearing before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, General Almquist stated that Israel had an offensive chemical weapons capability.

In 1992, El Al Flight 1862 bound for Tel Aviv crashed outside Amsterdam. During the course of the crash investigation, fifty gallons of dimethyl methylphosphonate was found in the plane&#x27;s cargo. Dimethyl methylphosphonate is a CWC schedule 2 chemical that can be used in the production of the nerve agent sarin. The dimethyl methylphosphonate was bound for the Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona, a top-secret military installation outside Tel Aviv. The facility was also responsible for producing the poison used in a September 1997 assassination attempt on a leader of the Palestinian militant organization Hamas (Khaled Mashal). According to Israeli officials, the substance was destined for defensive research purposes, to test filters for gas masks. This shipment came from a US chemical plant to the IIBR under a US Department of Commerce license.

The 1993 the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment WMD proliferation assessment recorded Israel as a country known to have undeclared offensive chemical warfare capabilities.

In October 1998, the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported that Israeli F-16 fighters were equipped to carry chemical weapons and that their crews have been trained on the use of such weapons.

===Japan===
Japan both used and stored chemical weapons on the territory of mainland China between 1937 and 1945. They left approximately two million tons of chemical weapons in China at the end of the war. The weapons mostly contained a mustard gas-lewisite mixture. They are classified as &quot;abandoned chemical weapons&quot; under the CWC. The destruction of the weapons under a joint Japan-China program started in September 2010, in Nanjing using mobile destruction facilities.

During December 1993, Japan signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and ratified the CWC in 1995. The JSDF does have chemical weapon facilities and samples to use in the development of protection against chemical weapons. The JGSDF Central NBC protection Troop admitted having samples of sarin in 1995.

===Libya===
Libya produced limited quantities of chemical weapons during the 1980s and is known to have used these weapons in combat at least once when they attempted to use chemical weapons against Chadian troops in 1987.

Since then, Libya constructed what is believed to be the largest chemical weapon production facility in the developing world in the Rabta industrial complex. This facility was the cornerstone of the Libyan CW program and has produced mustard gas, sarin, and phosgene since production began in the late 1980s. In March 1990 a suspicious fire broke out there following accusations by the United States.

Strict United Nations sanctions from 1992 to 1999 rendered Rabta inactive.

Libya used chemical weapons, under Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime, in a war with Chad. In 2003, Gaddafi agreed to accede to the CWC in exchange for &quot;rapprochement&quot; with western nations. At the time of the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, Libya still controlled approximately 11.25 tons of poisonous mustard gas. Because of destabilization, concerns increased regarding possibilities and likelihood that control of these agents could be lost. With terrorism at the core of concern, international bodies cooperated to ensure Libya is held to its obligations under the treaty. Libya&#x27;s post-Gaddafi National Transitional Council is cooperating with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regarding the destruction of all legacy chemical weapons in the country. After assessing the chemical stockpiles, the Libyan government will receive a deadline from the OPCW to destroy the CW.

Libya&#x27;s chemical program was completely abandoned on December 19, 2003 along with their other weapons of mass destruction programs as part of a program to get sanctions lifted and normalize relations with foreign governments. In 2004, between 27 February and 3 March, Libya destroyed 3,200 chemical weapon artillery shells under supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 5 March 2004, Libya declared a stockpile of 23 tons of mustard gas as well as precursors for sarin and other chemicals. Libya officially acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention in June 2004.

On 12 January 2018, the United States acknowledged that Libya has destroyed its remaining chemical weapons stockpile.

===Myanmar===

Intelligence regarding Myanmar&#x27;s chemical weapon status is mixed, and sometimes contradictory. In the late 1990s, US naval intelligence identified Myanmar (then referred to as Burma) as developing chemical weapons capabilities. Later, other officials contradicted that statement, claiming that the evidence supporting Burma&#x27;s chemical stockpile development was primarily based upon circumstantial evidence.

In July 2014 five journalists in Myanmar were sentenced to ten years in jail after publishing a report saying Myanmar was planning to build a new chemical weapons plant on farmland in the country&#x27;s Magwe Region.

At an annual OPCW conference in 2019, the United States claimed Myanmar maintained a stockpile of chemical weapons dating to 1982. In November 2023, amidst a civil war, rebel groups of the Brotherhood Alliance accused the military of using chemical weapons on its forces multiple times in Shan State townships. The Arakan Army did the same in early December of that year in Chin State, which the military denied.

Myanmar signed the Chemical Weapons Convention on 14 January 1993, and ratified the agreement on 8 July 2015. The convention entered into effect 7 August 2015.

===North Korea===
North Korea did not sign CWC and is believed to have maintained an extensive chemical weapons program since the mid-1950s. The program includes research, production, stockpiling and weaponisation of large quantities of chemical agents (perhaps as many as 5000 tons), including blister, nerve, choking, psychochemical incapacitant, vomiting and riot control agents. Several dozen facilities have been identified as likely involved in the offensive program. The production capability of these facilities is estimated as 4500 tons of chemical agents per year. North Korean armed forces also have large quantities of delivery systems that could carry chemical warheads, including different artillery systems, aerial bombs, mines, tactical ballistic missiles (SCUD), and long-range ballistic missiles (Nodong and Taepodong-2 systems). The technological advancement of this program is uncertain, and some sources doubt whether North Korea is able to produce large quantities of nerve agents or fit the chemical warheads on its long-range ballistic missiles.

It reportedly acquired the technology necessary to produce tabun and mustard gas as early as the 1950s. In 2009, the International Crisis Group reported that the consensus expert view was that North Korea had a stockpile of about 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, sarin (GB) and other nerve agents including VX.

===Pakistan===
Since 1970s and 1980s, Pakistan had been long suspected of running a possible military chemical weapons program both by Soviet Union and the United States. In 1991, Rear Admiral Thomas Brooks identified Pakistan as a &quot;probable&quot; chemical weapons possessor in testimony before Congress. In 1992, India and Pakistan signed a bilateral arms control treaty of chemical weapons that requires both countries to make a commitment to not develop, possess or use chemical weapons.

On January 13, 1993, Pakistan became an original signatory of Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and ratifying the treaty on November 27, 1997. Since being its signatory, the Pakistan is not known to have ever possessed a militarized chemical weapons program, and is a member in good standing of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Despite its good standing, Pakistan has been accused of covertly running a military chemical weapons program– the accusations primarily made by India since 1970s. Indian assertion is primarily based on the import of toxic chemicals and metals and the absence of their use in the civilian biochemical industry.

In 1999, Pakistan, addressing the Indian allegations at the United Nations, announced a mandate and regulation for all domestic chemical producers to &quot;furnish details of the chemicals&quot; imported or used in Pakistan.

===Russia===


Russia entered the CWC with the largest declared stockpile of chemical weapons. By 2010 the country had destroyed 18,241 tonnes at destruction facilities located in Gorny (Saratov Oblast) and Kambarka (Udmurt Republic), where operations have finished and Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast), Maradykovsky (Kirov Oblast), (Penza Oblast) while installations are under construction in Pochep (Bryansk Oblast) and Kizner (Udmurt Republic). By 2016, Russia destroyed around 94% of its chemical weapons and planned to completely destroy its remaining stockpile by the end of 2018. On September 27, 2017 Russia announced the destruction of the last batch of chemical weapons, completing the total destruction of its chemical arsenal ahead of schedule.

On March 4, 2018, Russia was alleged to have conducted a chemical attack in Salisbury, England, that left five injured including the alleged target of the attack, Sergei Skripal.

Russia destroyed about 25,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, or 62 percent of its 40,000-ton stockpile as of April 29, 2012 – the deadline set by the Chemical Weapons Convention for complete arsenal destruction. Russia expected 2020 to be more realistic but according to Russia, they fully destroyed their arsenal weapons on September 27, 2017.

===Serbia and Montenegro===
The former Yugoslavia is known to have produced a variety of chemical weapons (CW). The majority of stockpiled CW is believed to have been inherited by its successor, Serbia.

Reports indicate that the former Yugoslavia&#x27;s Army produced large quantities of sarin (50 tons), sulfur mustard, phosgene, the incapacitant BZ (allegedly a stockpile of 300 tons) and tear gas. At least four chemical warfare production facilities have been identified in Serbia: Prva Iskra in Baric; Miloje Blagojevic in Lucani; and Milojie Zakic and Merima in Krusevac. While the Trajal plant in Krusevac has been shut down, serious questions exist about accounting and previous production and storage of chemical materials there, as well as the lack of accounting on the other three sites.

Yugoslavia used its CW technologies to develop chemical munitions for Iraq prior to the first Gulf War in the &quot;Little Hawk&quot; program and chemical munitions for the Orkan MLRS system under the &quot;KOL15&quot; program.

The former Yugoslavia signed the Geneva Protocol in 1929. In April 2000, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

===South Korea===
Prior to 1997, South Korea was strongly suspected of possessing an active chemical weapons program and was identified as a &quot;probable&quot; chemical weapons possessor by the United States.

On April 18, 1997, South Korea signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and made a secret declaration. It is thought that South Korea is the &quot;state party&quot; referred to in Chemical Weapons Convention materials. There are reports that South Korea is operating a secret facility in Yeongdong County, Chungcheongbuk-do Province for the destruction of chemical agents.

===South Sudan===
In February 2016, the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition accused the South Sudanese government of attacking them with chemical weapons in the ongoing South Sudanese Civil War.

===Sudan===
Some past reports of uncertain credibility indicated that Sudan may have used chemical weapons against the rebels in the southern part of this country. Sudan accessed to CWC in 1999 and did not declare any offensive CW program. U.S. Department of State claims that it lacks sufficient evidence to determine whether Sudan is engaged in activities prohibited by CWC.

===Syria===

Prior to September 2013, Syria was one of seven states not to party with the Chemical Weapons Convention. As a party to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, it was prohibited from using chemical weapons in war yet unhindered in their production, storage and transfer.

When questioned about the topic, Syrian officials stated that they feel it is an appropriate deterrent against Israel&#x27;s undeclared nuclear weapons program which they believe exists. On July 23, 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged, for the first time, that it had chemical weapons.

Independent assessments indicate that Syria could have produced up to a few hundred tons of chemical agent per year. Syria reportedly manufactures the unitary agents: Sarin, Tabun, VX, and mustard gas.

Syrian chemical weapons production facilities have been identified by Western nonproliferation experts at the following 5 sites, plus a suspected weapons base:
* Al Safir (Scud missile base)
* Cerin
* Hama
* Homs
* Latakia
* Palmyra

In July 2007, a Syrian arms depot exploded, killing at least 15 Syrians. Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly, a UK magazine reporting on military and corporate affairs, believed that the explosion happened when Iranian and Syrian military personnel attempted to fit a Scud missile with a mustard gas warhead. Syria stated that the blast was accidental and not chemical related.

On July 13, 2012, the Syrian government moved its stockpile to an undisclosed location.

In September 2012, information emerged that the Syrian military had begun testing chemical weapons and was reinforcing and resupplying a base housing these weapons located east of Aleppo in August.

On March 19, 2013, news emerged from Syria indicating the first use of chemical weapons since the beginning of the Syrian uprising.

On August 21, 2013, testimony and photographic evidence emerged from Syria indicating a large-scale chemical weapons attack on Ghouta, a populated urban center.

An agreement was reached September 14, 2013, called the Framework For Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons, leading to the elimination of Syria&#x27;s chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014.

On October 14, 2013, Syria officially acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention.

On September 14, 2013, the United States and Russia announced an agreement that would lead to the elimination of Syria&#x27;s chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014. Syria officially acceded to the CWC on October 14, but has yet to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is believed Syria first received chemical weapons in 1973 from Egypt in the form of artillery shells. Since then it is thought Syria has one of the most advanced chemical weapons programs in the Middle East.

Syria&#x27;s chemical arsenal

Syria is thought to have amassed large quantities of sarin, tabun, and mustard and is currently weaponizing VX. Exact quantities are hard to know although the CIA has estimated Syria possesses several hundred liters of chemical weapons with hundreds of tons of agents produced annually.

Production

Syria has four main production sites. One just north of Damascus, one near Homs, one in Hama and one, al-Safir south-east of Aleppo.

===Taiwan===

U.S. Congress was informed in 1989 that Taiwan could have acquired offensive chemical weapons capability, including stockpiles of sarin. The alleged facilities include Tsishan and Kuanhsi. Taiwanese authorities acknowledged only the existence of a defensive research program.

===Turkey===
Turkey emerged from the cold war relatively unprotected and is gravely concerned about the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical weapons that have been used in the vicinity of the Turkish state. Turkey is party to both the Chemical Weapons Convention since 1997 and the Biological Weapons Convention since 1974.

Turkey has been accused of using chemical weapons in Afrin against Kurdish rebels, but the country has denied that civilians in its operation against the Kurdish YPG fighters in northwestern Syria were affected by chemical weapons from the Turkish military. The country has sharply condemned and verified some of the chemical weapons used in the Syrian civil war.

===United States===

The United States has used multiple types of chemical weapons both in war and in testing. For example, testing of how various chemical weapons will disperse in different climates and delivery systems during Operation LAC. Police forces periodically use CS against violent protests domestically, while use and deployment is banned in military use. The United States possessed a stockpile of chemical weapons since World War I. It banned the production or transport of chemical weapons in 1969. The U.S. began chemical weapons disposal and destruction in the 1960s, first by deep-sea burial; by the 1970s, incineration was the primary disposal method used. The use of chemical weapons was officially renounced in 1991, and the U.S. signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993. As of July 7, 2023, the remaining stockpiles of sulfur mustard were announced to be destroyed.

The United States has completed destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile it declared in 1997, guided by RCRA regulations. As of 2023 complete destruction and deactivation was achieved on July 7, 2023.

The U.S. policy on the use of chemical weapons is to reserve the right to retaliate. First use, or preemptive use, is a violation of stated policy. Only the president of the United States can authorize the first retaliatory use.
 Official policy now reflects the likelihood of chemical weapons being used as a terrorist weapon.

<text>The Isuzu MU is a mid-size SUV which was produced by Japan-based manufacturer Isuzu from 1989 to 2005. 

The three-door MU was introduced in 1989, followed in 1990 by the five-door version called Isuzu MU Wizard. Production of these first generation models ceased in 1998 to be replaced by a second generation. This time, the five-door version dropped the &quot;MU&quot; prefix, to become the Isuzu Wizard. The acronym &quot;MU&quot; is short for &quot;Mysterious Utility&quot;. Isuzu manufactured several variations to the MU and its derivates for sale in other countries.

The short-wheelbase (three-door) version was sold as the Isuzu MU and Honda Jazz in Japan, with the names Isuzu Amigo and later Isuzu Rodeo Sport used in the United States. Throughout continental Europe, the three-door was called Opel Frontera Sport, with the Vauxhall Frontera Sport title used in the United Kingdom, and Holden Frontera Sport in Australia.

The long-wheelbase (five-door) version was available as the Isuzu Wizard in Japan, and in North America as Isuzu Rodeo and the Honda Passport. Opel, Vauxhall, and Holden each also sold rebadged versions of the five-door as the Opel Frontera, Vauxhall Frontera, and Holden Frontera. It was also sold as the Chevrolet Frontera in Egypt, the Isuzu Cameo and Isuzu Vega in Thailand, the Isuzu Frontier in South Africa, and as the Chevrolet Rodeo in Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia.
== First generation (1989) ==


The three-door Isuzu MU made its debut in Japan during 1989, with the five-door MU Wizard introduced the following year. Based on the Isuzu Faster (TF) pickup truck of 1988, both the three- and five-door models shared bodywork and most internal components from the front doors forward. Like the Faster pickup, the MU and MU Wizard featured rear- and four-wheel drive layout configurations.

Between 1993 and 1996, Honda retailed three-door versions of the MU under the name Honda Jazz for the Japanese market under a model sharing arrangement that resulted in several Isuzu models being badged Honda and vice versa.

=== Markets ===
;North America
Sales of the three-door began in the United States during the second quarter of 1989 under the Isuzu Amigo name. A 2.3-liter &quot;4ZD1&quot; inline-four engine, producing came standard with the RWD while the 4WD was offered with the 2.6-liter &quot;4ZE1&quot; engine. The transmission was initially manual only. There were very limited options for the early Amigo including air conditioning, seating for two or four, and two trim levels to choose from, S or XS. 

Some of the model year changes throughout production included: 

* 1991: small cosmetic alterations, including a more rounded grille 
* 1992: the standardization of the 2.6-liter engine and the added availability of a four-speed automatic transmission on the RWD version for 1992. 
* 1993: the grille was enlarged and the front bumper slightly altered. 
* 1994, a high mount rear stop light was added and power steering and mirrors were made standard. 
* 1995: The Amigo was dropped by Isuzu in the US market. 

A limited number of XS-F editions (with the &quot;F&quot; standing for &quot;Frontera&quot;) were produced which had additional options such as power windows and locking as well as four-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS), which were inactive in low-range 4WD mode and only active on the rear wheels in 4WD high-range. This version of the Amigo had only 49-state emissions (reasons unknown) and there are no official sales numbers, although most dealers agree there were fewer than 75 sold. The only badging used to distinguish this model from the outside was a sport-blue XS symbol with a sport-font &quot;F&quot; beside it (also finished in sport blue).

Isuzu introduced the five-door Isuzu Rodeo to the United States in 1990 for the 1991 model year. It was available with either a 2.6-liter inline-four engine rated at 119 horsepower or a 3.1-liter V6 engine made by General Motors (GM), which had the same horsepower output as the 2.6 but more torque. An automatic transmission was available for the V6. 

Like the Amigo, the Rodeo was available in both RWD and 4WD, with the latter featuring manually locking hubs on the S version and automatically locking hubs on the XS and top-of-the-line LS. Rear-wheel ABS were standard feature on 4WDs. A RWD manual transmission model with a tank was rated at in city driving by the EPA, and on the highway. A 4WD model with the V6 and automatic transmission was rated at city and highway.

All Rodeos had a rear seat bottom which folded forward and rear seat back which folded down, extending the cargo area. The vehicle&#x27;s lug wrench was stored under the seat bottom, concealed by a carpeted Velcro flap. The jack was located behind a plastic panel in the rear left of the cargo area along with the rear windshield washer fluid reservoir if equipped. The LS was available with privacy glass, velour upholstery, and split-folding rear seats. A secret locking compartment was fitted in the depths of the center console below a removable cassette storage bin. The vehicle weighed , depending on engine and options.

For the 1993 model year, Isuzu replaced the GM V6 engine with their own 3.2-liter 24-valve SOHC V6 which was rated at . Manually locking hubs were eliminated, but the floor-mounted transfer case shifter remained. The 1993 Rodeo featured a recalibrated suspension system, softened spring rates and softened shock valving. The Rodeo now weighed between and the EPA rating was city and highway. Also for 1993, a &quot;Family II&quot; 2.4 litre four-cylinder engine from Holden was introduced, and the Rodeo gained a third brake light above the rear window and a more refined center console. The &quot;V6&quot; badge on V6 models was moved behind the front wheels. Midway through 1995, the Rodeo received an updated dashboard and steering wheel, both of which added airbags. The &quot;ISUZU&quot; badge on the front grille also shrunk in size. For 1996 Isuzu increased the power of their 3.2-liter V6 up to and of torque, and the top level trim LS received the same 16-inch aluminium wheels as the Trooper, and was available in two-tone exterior colors.

Isuzu sold 24,612 Rodeos in 1991 and 45,257 Rodeos in 1992. US models were manufactured at Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, Inc. (now, Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.) in Lafayette, Indiana. The vehicle was still considered an import, as 75 percent of its parts were made overseas.

The first-generation Isuzu Rodeo and its twin, the Honda Passport, received a rating of &quot;Poor&quot; in the IIHS frontal offset test conducted at 40 mph due to a poor safety cage and dummy movement, and excessive footwell intrusion that contributed to injuries to both legs.
;Europe

This series was known in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Frontera and in the rest of Europe as the Opel Frontera. It was launched in November 1991 and built at the former Bedford van factory in Luton, England; it would become known as the IBC factory (&quot;I&quot;suzu &quot;B&quot;edford &quot;C&quot;ompany). In the 1980s the plant had come under joint control between Isuzu and General Motors, with the Frontera being built alongside a number of other commercial vehicle models. The Australian and New Zealand version of the model range was known as the Holden Frontera and these were also produced at the Luton facility. The Frontera was Vauxhall&#x27;s answer to the growing demand for 4X4 vehicles in Europe - particularly the right-hand drive British market - during the 1980s, where Japanese imported products from Daihatsu, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Toyota had proven hugely successful, not to mention the success of the long-running British Land Rover and Range Rover. Despite the vast and growing competition in the 4X4 market, the Frontera sold well throughout Europe.

The early cars (to 1995) had a choice of engines, with the LWB available with either a 2.4-liter petrol (C24NE) engine (developed in the Opel Manta i240) or the 2.3-liter diesel (23DTR) engine originally fitted in the Bedford CF van and Vauxhall Carlton. The Frontera sport (Isuzu Amigo) was available with the 2.0-liter petrol Vauxhall Cavalier engine (C20NE).

In 1995, the model went through a facelift and the Frontera received rear coil springs and a new line up of engines. The SWB gained a new 2.0-liter petrol (X20 series) engine, updated trim, and also the first diesel engine available for the SWB, the 2.8-liter (4JB1-TC). The LWB also had new engines, with the 2.2-liter petrol (X22SE) and the 2.8 diesel 4JB1-TC being made available.

In the 1996–1997 models interior trim, including the dashboard, was changed, and a new 2.5-liter diesel (&quot;VM41&quot;) engine was fitted. This engine was also used in the Range Rover Classic and Jeep Cherokee in the UK.

;Australia
In October 1995, Holden of Australia and New Zealand introduced the MU under the Holden &quot;Frontera&quot; badge in Australia and Holden &quot;Wizard&quot; badge in New Zealand. Designated the &quot;UT&quot; or &quot;M7&quot; series, the Holden was based on the three-door body and manufactured in the United Kingdom. It was offered in one level of trim, the &quot;Sport 4×4&quot;, offered solely with a manual transmission.

;Asia
Jiangling (Jiangling Motors Corporation Limited) Landwind in China produces a copy of the Isuzu Rodeo for the Chinese market. It is the first SUV to fail the Euro NCAP crash tests. The Landwind is based on the first generation Rodeo although there was no collaboration between JMC and Isuzu or GM. While the Landwind looks like the Rodeo it is not an Isuzu vehicle.

For the Thai market, the MU Wizard was sold as the Isuzu Cameo (1993–1996) and Isuzu Vega (1999–2004) in Thailand. The Cameo using a 2.5-liter 4JA1 diesel direct injection engine, producing at 3,900 rpm and the maximum torque of at 1,800 rpm came standard. The transmission was 5-speed manual with rear wheel drive only. The equipment is the same as in the TF and the only body style available is a five-door wagon. In 1999, Isuzu Thailand decided to have a major change for Cameo and gave it new name Vega, equipped with four-wheel drive only. Exterior differences from Cameo including the new frontal design, halogen headlights, 15-inch wheels with 265/70R15 tires and the spare wheel on the back door. It was introduced with 2.8-liter engine 4JB1-T and the brand new 3.0-liter 4JH1-T turbodiesel, producing at 3,800 rpm and maximum torque of at 2,000 rpm, because of the development of the CCI (ISUZU Computer Controlled Injection) and HPI (ISUZU High Pressure Fuel Injection). In addition, it connected with a choice of 5-speed manual and &quot;Technomatics&quot; 4-speed automatic controlled by the TCM system (Transmission Control Module). The driver can manually choose style of driving by &quot;Normal mode&quot; and &quot;Power mode&quot;.

== Second generation (1998) ==


In September 1997, the second-generation MU (three-door) and Wizard (five-door; now with &quot;MU&quot; prefix dropped) were shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, with Japanese sales starting May 1998. North American and European sales began shortly thereafter.

In 2004, Isuzu added the optional 3.5-liter V6 gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine with and of torque. Isuzu was the first to offer (GDI) in a vehicle priced under US$100,000. The Rodeo weighs in at a little over , with an EPA estimated gas mileage for 2007 of city and highway for the two wheel drive model, and city and highway for the four wheel drive model.

The second generation Isuzu Rodeo and its twin, the Honda Passport received a rating of &quot;marginal&quot; in the IIHS frontal offset test conducted at due to a possible injury to the right leg and the head, but dummy movement was reasonably well controlled.

=== Markets ===
;North America

The Amigo made a comeback in the US for 1998 after a three-year hiatus with the second generation model alongside the redesigned Rodeo. The Amigo was originally only available only as a soft top with a five-speed transmission. Standard rear-mounted spare tire, ABS, and removable sunroof rounded out the feature set. Fender flares and special 16-inch wheels were available on the V6 and 4WD models. The Rodeo could also be optioned with a rear-mounted spare tire and its own 16-inch wheels on higher trim packages.

A new 2.2-liter &quot;X22SE&quot; engine built by Holden in Australia served as the base engine. Isuzu also offered the &quot;6VD1&quot; V6 that produced of torque at 3000 rpm. Fuel consumption is an estimated highway. From a technical perspective, the Rodeo and Amigo were built with a rigid frame that has eight crossmembers. Front suspension has independent lower and upper arms, with a solid rear axle. The Rodeo and Amigo 4WD models came with a modified Dana 44 rear axle and push-button four-wheel drive. They also had a traditional floor mounted lever for switching from high- to low-range. Underneath, both vehicles came with protective skid plates as a standard feature.

The North American Isuzu Amigo and Isuzu Rodeo were built at the Subaru Isuzu Automotive, Inc. assembly plant in Lafayette, Indiana.
* 1998: Second generation Rodeo and Amigo debut.
* 1999: The Amigo gains a hardtop version and an optional automatic transmission. The Amigo logo is changed to block letters to better match the Rodeo and other Isuzu models.
* 2000: The Rodeo and Amigo receive a visual refresh with beefier bumpers, new headlights, tail lights, and grille designs. On the inside, new seats and seat fabrics are introduced. The Amigo gets its own unique grille, light gray bumpers with faux bumper guard, matching light gray fender flares, and black-trimmed headlights. For the five-door Rodeo, adjustable shock absorbers were new this year and 16-inch tires became standard on all models. Cruise control was now standard on V6 Rodeos, and an automatic transmission became standard on the LSE edition. A new &quot;Intelligent Suspension Control&quot; featuring a dashboard button to adjust shock damping between &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; settings became standard on the LSE and optional on LS models. The Honda Passport did not get the adjustable-shock system. A new Ironman package debuted for the LS, marking Isuzu&#x27;s sponsorship of the Ironman triathlon competition. The package included white or black paint over gray lower body panels, crossbars for the roof rack, and special graphics.
* 2001: In celebration of Isuzu&#x27;s 85th anniversary, an Anniversary Edition was added, along with a revised Ironman Package. The Amigo is renamed the Rodeo Sport.
* 2002: Last model year for Rodeo sales in Canada, as a result of Isuzu withdrawing from Canada after the 2002 model year. This is also the last year for the Honda Passport.
* 2003: New grille and headlights debut; as well as a revised dash and steering wheel. Last year for the Rodeo Sport. Halfway through the 2003 model year Isuzu switched to the Aisin AW30-40LS automatic transmission. This resulted in 4WD models losing their physical shifter and gaining a dash mounted knob to engage high and low-range.
* 2004: The Rodeo Sport (three-door model) is discontinued as well as the four-cylinder engine on the Rodeo. However, a new optional 3.5-liter engine debuts. Added midyear was a standard tire-pressure monitor.

In October 2010, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recalled 1998–2002 Rodeos, 2002 Isuzu Axioms, and 1998–2002 Honda Passports due to corrosion of the vehicle&#x27;s frame in the vicinity of the rear suspension. Vehicles without corrosion in the affected area would be treated with an anti-corrosion compound. Vehicles with more severe corrosion would have a reinforcement bracket installed. In some cases, corrosion was so severe that repairs could not be made, resulting in Isuzu and Honda purchasing vehicles from the owners. The final MU rolled of the assembly line on June 5, 2004.

;Europe
In the United Kingdom, the second generation Isuzu MU and Wizard were sold as the Vauxhall Frontera (five-door) and Vauxhall Frontera Sport (three-door). In continental Europe it was sold as the Opel Frontera (five-door) and Opel Frontera Sport (three-door).

After General Motors took full control over the IBC Vehicles factory in 1998, the Frontera production line was planned to be transferred to General Motors&#x27; Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port. However, with the closure of the Vauxhall Luton plant the decision to move was reversed. In 1998 the new model series was introduced with a choice of 2.2- petrol, 2.2-liter diesel (&quot;X22DTH&quot;) and 3.2-liter V6 petrol engines. Further modifications were carried out on the diesel engine post-2001, with the final version to be fitted in the marque being the 2.2-liter (&quot;Y22&quot;) version. This model met the Euro 3 Emissions standard.

The Frontera was discontinued from production at IBC Luton in 2005 (the final models in the UK were produced in Olympus trim). In Australia and New Zealand, the Holden Frontera was replaced by a Holden badged version of the Chevrolet Captiva model range, while in Europe it was replaced by the Opel Antara, that was also available as a Vauxhall.

;Australia
Holden in Australia and New Zealand also retailed the second generation model from February 1999 as the &quot;UE&quot; or &quot;MX&quot; series Frontera. This time, both three- and five-door bodies were offered—now produced in the US. The five-door models had the 3.2-liter V6 engine rated at and with optional automatic transmission, whilst the three-door Frontera Sport retained a four-cylinder engine and manual transmission only. Although the Frontera Sport came in just one specification, the five-door wagon offered base, S and SE trims. Holden facelifted the model in 2000 with a revised front grille and front bumper, reshaped headlamps and new taillamp lenses. In late 2001, a second upgrade arrived, bringing reductions in engine noise, the fitment of an electronic throttle, a change to the SE model&#x27;s ABS calibration to bring improvements to dirt road performance, and several interior upgrades. Holden discontinued the Frontera Sport in June 2002. The five-door wagon continued until 2003, but it was ultimately semi-replaced with the Adventra that year.

<doc id="1310669" wikidata="Q220992" url="?curid=1310669" title="Long Tall Sally (EP)">
<text>Long Tall Sally is the fifth UK EP release by British rock band The Beatles and the band&#x27;s first UK EP to include songs not previously released on an album or single in the United Kingdom. (Side 1 had been released in America that April, on &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;, while Side 2 would be released in July on the North American album &quot;Something New&quot;.) It was released by Parlophone in mono, with the catalogue number GEP 8913, and released in the United Kingdom on 19 June 1964. It was also released in Spain and France.

The EP includes three cover versions—the title track, &quot;Slow Down&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot;—as well as one Lennon-McCartney original, &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;, a song originally given to Billy J. Kramer and his backing band, The Dakotas. Kramer had released the song as the B-side of another Lennon-McCartney song, &quot;Bad to Me&quot;, which reached number 1 in the UK and number 9 in the US. In 1988, all four of the songs from the EP were included on the compilation album &quot;Past Masters, Volume One&quot;.

The picture on the EP cover was taken by Robert Freeman, as stated on the back.

*Paul McCartney bass; lead vocal 
*George Harrison lead and rhythm guitars
*Ringo Starr drums; cowbell ; lead vocal 

Additional personnel

==Other releases==
*In the United States, the EP was split and released on &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; (&quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;) and &quot;Something New&quot; (&quot;Slow Down&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot;).
*In Canada, the first two tracks were included on a full-length album of the same name, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Long Tall Sally&quot;.
*In 1976, the four tracks on the EP were issued as part of the double album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;, a collection of 28 Beatles recordings. This marked the UK stereo debut of these tracks on an album. 
*In 1978, the tracks were again included on the UK LP &quot;Rarities&quot;, first released as part of &quot;The Beatles Collection&quot;, then individually in the UK, with all four songs appearing in mono. The US version of &quot;Rarities&quot; featured a different track listing and did not include the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP songs, since they had all been previously released on American albums.
*In 1988, the EP was compiled with the Beatles&#x27; singles and released as part of the &quot;Past Masters&quot; collection, which, when combined with the 12 original British albums plus the American album &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, made all of the Beatles&#x27; UK releases available on compact disc. Once again, the four songs were in stereo. 
*The EP was reissued in 1992 as part of the 15-disc &quot;Compact Disc EP Collection&quot;, featuring the songs in their original monophonic sound.
*In December 2004, Capitol Records issued a four-disc CD boxed set, &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot;, which included reissues of the first four American Capitol albums on compact disc for the first time. The songs &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; were on disc 2 (&quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;), with &quot;Slow Down&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot; on disc 3 (&quot;Something New&quot;). The songs on all four discs were presented in both mono and stereo.
*In 2009, the Beatles&#x27; UK recordings were remastered and reissued again, in both stereo and mono, with both formats available as boxed sets and the former also available as individual releases. The stereo releases included &quot;Past Masters&quot;, while the mono box set contained a new mono version of the compilation, &quot;Mono Masters&quot;, making all of the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; tracks available in both formats simultaneously.
*On 28 November 2014, the EP was reissued in limited numbers to independently owned record stores for Record Store Day.

<text>A gun moll or gangster moll or gangster&#x27;s moll is the female companion of a male professional criminal. &quot;Gun&quot; was British slang for thief, derived from Yiddish &quot;ganef&quot; (גנבֿ). &quot;Moll&quot; is also used as a euphemism for a woman prostitute.

==Notable examples==
Prominent, true-life gun molls (and the men they were associated with) include:

* Beulah Baird – Charles &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd
* Jean Delaney (Crompton) – Tommy Carroll
* Phoolan Devi – Indian dacoit, gun moll of Vikram Mallah, later turned into the gang leader after his death
* Victoria DiGiorgio Gotti – John Gotti
* Judith Exner – an American woman who claimed to be the mistress of U.S. president John F. Kennedy and of Mafia leaders Sam Giancana and John Roselli
* Evelyn &quot;Billie&quot; Frechette – John Dillinger
* Buda Godman (; 1888–1945) – John Homer T. (&quot;Dapper Jackie&quot;) French, member of the Lou Blonger Gang of Denver. A photo of Buda holding a gun is found in Philip S. Van Cise&#x27;s &quot;Fighting the Underworld.&quot;
* Catherine Greig – James Whitey Bulger
* Maria Victoria Henao – Pablo Escobar
* Karen Hill – Henry Hill
* Virginia Hill – Bugsy Siegel
* Mary Kinder &quot;(née&quot; Mary Northern; 1909–1981) – Harry Pierpont
* Opal &quot;Mack Truck&quot; Long – Russell Clark
* Edna Murray – wife of &quot;Diamond Joe&quot; Sullivan, who was executed for murder in 1924. She then married Jack Murray, who was imprisoned for 25 years in 1925. She then lived with Volney Davis, until they were both arrested for kidnapping in 1935. 
* Mary O&#x27;Dare – Raymond Hamilton
* Bonnie Parker – Clyde Barrow
* Geraldine &quot;Geri&quot; McGee Rosenthal – Frank Rosenthal
* Kathryn Thorne &quot;(née&quot; Cleo May Brooks; 1904–1985) – George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly
* Helen Gillis &quot;(née&quot; Wawzynak; 1908–1987) – George &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson

<text>The Litchfield Hills (also known as the Northwest Hills or Northwest Highlands) are a geographic region of the U.S. state of Connecticut located in the northwestern corner of the state. It is roughly coterminous with the boundaries of Litchfield County, for which it is named. The geographic region includes colloquial subregions—rural Northwestern Connecticut and the area associated with the city of Torrington, also known as the Upper Naugatuck River Valley or simply Litchfield Hills—which have also variously corresponded to designated government councils both past and present. Much of the area makes up the lowermost section of the Berkshires and is culturally similar to the rest of western New England.

==Towns and cities==

* Barkhamsted
* Burlington
* Canaan
* Colebrook
* Cornwall
* Goshen
* Hartland
* Harwinton
* Kent
* Litchfield
* Morris
* New Hartford
* Norfolk
* North Canaan
* Roxbury
* Salisbury
* Sharon
* Torrington
* Warren
* Washington
* Winchester
==Characteristics==
The Litchfield hills are known for their distinct rural scenery, which can stand in contrast to central and southern Connecticut, which is largely urbanized or suburbanized. (However, there is some encroachment of development into the region as people from greater Hartford move west and people from New York City, northern New Jersey, and parts of Fairfield County move north.) This region is a key part of the Housatonic River and Farmington River watersheds, and encompasses a number of Connecticut&#x27;s highest peaks, such as Bear Mountain and Canaan Mountain. Most of the region comprises forested and rocky hills with farmland and small towns interspersed in the flatter areas. The terrain in the Litchfield Hills area varies from gently rolling to the south and east to more mountainous toward the north and west. The region generally experiences colder temperatures due to higher elevation. The Litchfield Hills, like the rest of Northwest Connecticut, are known for their town greens, fall foliage, and historical architecture. The hills comprise the southernmost portion of the Berkshires. This region also plays host to a large portion of the state&#x27;s small vineyard and wine industry. Historically, the region was well known for the limestone, iron, and dairy industries.

A unique term to the region is the word &quot;raggie&quot;. Used as an insult by some and with a sense of local pride by others, the term &quot;raggie&quot; denotes someone with a lower income and approximates the term &quot;white trash&quot;. The term probably originated from iron workers from Mount Riga in Salisbury. These workers were often poor immigrants who wore grubby clothes as a result of their work. After the iron works closed down, the workers moved to Norfolk, Winsted, and Torrington, and the name stuck. The term &quot;raggie&quot; is rarely, if ever, heard elsewhere.

==Subregions==
===Northwestern Connecticut===
The towns included in the Northwestern Connecticut region are: Canaan, Cornwall, Kent, North Canaan, Roxbury, Salisbury, Sharon, Warren, Washington. Unlike the rest of Connecticut, the portion of Northwestern Connecticut around the upper Housatonic River contains more alkaline soils due to the underlying limestone. The flatter regions around the Housatonic River provide some of the best soils for farming in Litchfield County.

Due to the rural feel of the area, the region is an extremely popular location for second homes, primarily with New York City residents. The hills are rural enough to offer an escape from city life, yet close enough (less than 90 miles) to visit on weekends. Many visitors also arrive in the autumn to witness the fall foliage, and to visit the region&#x27;s covered bridges or its many waterfalls.

The area has been and continues to be home to many famous or wealthy residents, including Mia Farrow, Meryl Streep, Dustin Hoffman, Denis Leary, Kevin Bacon, This region is very similar to portions of Berkshire County, Massachusetts, which lies just to the north.

Northwestern Connecticut is known for its cultural activities, such as chamber performances at Music Mountain in Canaan and a wide array of art galleries. The region is also home to preparatory schools, such as the Hotchkiss School, Kent School, Marvelwood School, and The Gunnery.

===Litchfield Hills===
The Litchfield Hills region is also known as the Upper Naugatuck Valley and consists of the towns of Barkhamsted, Bethlehem, Colebrook, Goshen, Hartland, Harwinton, Litchfield, Morris, New Hartford, Norfolk, Torrington, and Winchester. The Litchfield Hills feel a stronger pull toward industry than Northwestern Connecticut, with manufacturing centering on the Naugatuck River in Torrington and Mad River in Winsted. Historically, brass, needles, scythes, and other products were manufactured in the area. However, the rural areas still retain industries such as dairy, vineyards, and stone. This region is sometimes included with the Naugatuck River Valley.

Originally settled in the mid 18th century as agriculturally based towns, the areas with access to flowing water began to develop industries in the 19th century. As the Midwest opened up to settlement, many farmers headed west in search of better farming opportunities. Among these included the John Brown family, originally from Torrington. Some notable areas settled by people from the Litchfield Hills include the Western Reserve of Ohio and Torrington, Wyoming. Around the time industry became important in the area, many immigrants came to work in the factories. Many of the immigrants in the Litchfield Hills area came from Italy, Ireland, Lebanon, Poland, and Slovakia. Later in the 20th century, many of these industries declined or relocated, producing conditions similar to the Midwestern rust belt, but on a smaller scale. Today, tourism remains an important industry for the Litchfield Hills.

The eastern towns, including Hartland, Barkhamsted, and New Hartford contain large water supply reservoirs to the city of Hartford.

Culturally, the Litchfield Hills are politically more conservative than the rest of Connecticut, with Litchfield County being the only county in the state to vote for George W. Bush in the 2004 election. The region contains its own section in the Waterbury &quot;Republican-American&quot;, which covers local events and news. The region is also split between allegiance to the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, with the southwestern part of the region generally supporting the Yankees and northeastern part of the region generally supporting the Red Sox.

<text>Robert David &quot;Bob&quot; Banman (born January 10, 1945 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a politician from Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1973 to 1986, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Sterling Lyon.

The son of Jacob G. Banman and Barbara Enns, he was raised in Steinbach, Manitoba. He worked as an automobile dealer after graduating from high school and was on the Steinbach Town Council from 1970 to 1973. In 1968, Banman married Joanne Baerg.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1973 Manitoba general election, defeating incumbent Liberal Leonard Barkman by about 550 votes in the rural riding of La Verendrye. He was re-elected in the 1977 election, which was won by the Conservatives under Sterling Lyon.

Banman was named Minister of Industry and Commerce and Manitoba Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs|Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs on October 24, 1977, also holding responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on October 20, 1978, he was named Minister of Fitness, Recreation and Sport and Minister of Cooperative Development, with responsibility for the MDCA. On November 15, 1979, he was also named responsible for the Communities Economic Development Fund and the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act (which was retitled the Manitoba Lotteries and Gaming Control Act on January 16, 1981). As Industry Minister, he considered privatizing the government-owned company McKenzie Seeds.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the provincial election of 1981, but Banman was re-elected in his own riding by 3,269 votes. He did not run for a fourth term as MLA in 1986.

<doc id="1310723" wikidata="Q2004972" url="?curid=1310723" title="Nominal number">
<text>Nominal numbers are numerals used as labels to identify items uniquely. Importantly, the actual values of the numbers which these numerals represent are less relevant, as they do not indicate quantity, rank, or any other measurement.

Labelling referees Smith and Kumar as referees &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; is a use of nominal numbers. Any set of numbers (a subset of the natural numbers) will be consistent labels as long as a &quot;distinct&quot; number is uniquely used for each distinct term which needs to be labelled. Nonetheless, sequences of integers may naturally be used as the simplest way to begin labelling; for example, 1, 2, 3, and so on.

==Definition==
The term &quot;nominal number&quot; may be quite recent and of limited use. It appears to have originated in school textbooks derived from the statistical term &quot;nominal data&quot;, defined as data indicating &quot;...merely statements of qualitative category of membership.&quot; This usage comes from the sense of as &quot;name&quot;.

Mathematically, nominal numbering is a one-to-one and onto function from a set of objects being named to a set of numerals, which may change (typically growing) over time: it is a function because each object is assigned a single numeral, it is one-to-one because different objects are assigned different numerals, and it is onto because every numeral in the set at a given time has associated with it a single named object.

&quot;Nominal number&quot; can be broadly defined as &quot;any numeral used for identification, however it was assigned&quot;, or narrowly as &quot;a numeral with no information other than identification&quot;.

For the purposes of naming, the term &quot;number&quot; is often used loosely to refer to any 
string (sequence of symbols), which may not consist entirely of digits—it is often alphanumeric. For instance, UK National Insurance numbers, some driver&#x27;s licence numbers, and some serial numbers contain letters.

===Use of nominal numbers===
&quot;Nominal&quot; refers to the &quot;use&quot; of numbers: any nominal number can be used by its numerical value as an integer—added to another, multiplied, compared in magnitude, and so forth—but for nominal numbers these operations are not, in general, meaningful. For example, the ZIP code 11111 is less than the ZIP code 12345, but that does not necessarily mean that 11111 was issued before 12345 or that the region denoted by 11111 is further south than 12345, though it might be. Similarly, one can add or subtract ZIP codes, but this is meaningless: does not have any meaning as a ZIP code.

In general, the only meaningful operation with nominal numbers is to compare two nominal numbers to see whether they are identical or not (whether they refer to the same object).


==Examples==
A great variety of numbers meet the broad definition, including:
* National identification numbers, such as:
** Social Security numbers
** Driver&#x27;s license numbers
** National Insurance number
* Routing numbers, such as:
** Bank codes and sort codes, such as International Bank Account Numbers or ABA routing transit numbers.
** Postal codes, such as ZIP codes (These are generally numeric in the United States, but other nations often use alphanumeric systems.)
** Telephone numbers, assigned by various telephone numbering plans, such as the ITU-T E.164 and the North American Numbering Plan (NANPA).
** Numbers of train or bus routes or the individual vehicles in public transport
* Car model names from some car manufacturers, such as BMW or Peugeot, are plain numbers.

These are usually assigned either in some hierarchical way, such as how telephone numbers are assigned (in NANPA) as Country Code + Area Code + Prefix + Suffix, where the first three are geographically based, or sequentially, as in serial numbers; these latter are thus properly &quot;ordinal&quot; numbers.

===Narrowly defined===
Numerical identifiers that are nominal numbers narrowly defined, viz, convey no information other than identity, are quite rare. These must be defined either arbitrarily or randomly, and most commonly arise in computer applications, such as dynamic IP addresses assigned by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. A more everyday example are sports squad numbers, which do not in general have any public meaning beyond identity, though they may be allocated based on some internal club or organization policy. In some settings, these are based on position, but in others they are associated with an individual, being a proper nominal number. The naming function is demonstrated by &quot;retired numbers&quot;, where a club no longer issues a number that has become associated with a particularly famous player, but reallocate others to new players when they become available.

<doc id="1310725" wikidata="Q7992816" url="?curid=1310725" title="When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?">
<text>When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? (2004) is the fourth and penultimate book written by George Carlin. He came up with the title because it offends all three major religions (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam). The book at first was not sold at Wal-Mart because its cover, which portrays Da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, depicted Carlin sitting next to the empty seat of Jesus. It is the third book by Carlin, the previous ones being &quot;Napalm and Silly Putty&quot; (2001) and &quot;Brain Droppings&quot; (1997). It was followed by the posthumous publication in 2009 of his &quot;sortabiography&quot; &quot;Last Words&quot;.

This book is for the most part written in the same style of Carlin&#x27;s other books, but with some notable thematic differences. In general, the tone of the book is darker and more critical than his previous books in terms of its outlook on politics and society. Also, much of the book is focused on euphemisms, both as used in advertising and in politically correct language. The book also incorporates much of Carlin&#x27;s standup material from across his career, taking segments from his most recent shows, as well as many of his very early performances.

An audiobook version of &quot;When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?&quot;, read by Carlin, was released at the same time as the book.

<doc id="1310735" wikidata="Q696961" url="?curid=1310735" title="Descendants of Darkness">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoko Matsushita. The story revolves around shinigami. These Guardians of Death work for &quot;Enma Daiō&quot;, the king of the dead, sorting out the expected and unexpected arrivals to the Underworld.

An anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff aired on Wowow from October to December 2000.

==Plot==
Asato&#x27;s catchphrase:

Series introduction:

Asato Tsuzuki has been a &#x27;Guardian of Death&#x27; for over 70 years. He has the power to call upon twelve &quot;shikigami&quot;, mythical creatures that aid him in battle. The manga portrays Tsuzuki&#x27;s relationship with the shinigami in much more detail. Tsuzuki is the senior partner of the Second Division, which watches over the region of Kyūshū.

In the anime, the story begins when Chief Konoe, the boss, and the other main characters discussing recent murders in Nagasaki. The victims all have bite marks and a shortage of blood, which leads to the case being known as &quot;The Vampire Case.&quot;

After some food troubles, Tsuzuki travels to Nagasaki with Gushoshin, a flying creature/helper who can speak, and together they do a bit of investigating. The rule is that Guardian of Death are supposed to work in pairs, and until Tsuzuki meets up with his new partner, he needs someone to watch him. However, Gushoshin gets held back by groceries, and Tsuzuki is on his own.

While exploring Nagasaki, Tsuzuki hears a scream and has a run-in with a strange white-haired woman with red eyes, who leaves blood on his collar. Taking this as is a sign that the woman might be the vampire, Tsuzuki tries to follow her. He comes to a church called Oura Cathedral, where he meets the story&#x27;s primary antagonist, Muraki.

Doctor Kazutaka Muraki is initially portrayed as a pure figure, with much religious and color symbolism. He meets Tsuzuki with tears in his eyes and Tsuzuki, thrown off, asks if Muraki has seen a woman recently. Muraki says no body has been in the church, and Tsuzuki leaves. Tsuzuki later learns that the woman that he encountered is Maria Won, a famous singer from China.

From there Tsuzuki continues through Nagasaki into the area of the city known as Glover Garden, where he is held at gunpoint from behind. His attacker tells him to turn around, and when he does, he discovers a young man glaring at him. He suspects this man is the vampire. Tsuzuki is then saved by Gushoshin. Afterwards Tsuzuki learns that the boy is Hisoka Kurosaki, his new partner, and the rest of the story is heavily based on character development and the relationships between characters.

Later in the Nagasaki Arc (the first fourth of the anime series, and the first collection of the manga), Hisoka is kidnapped by Muraki, and the truth about his death is revealed. Tsuzuki rescues him after his &quot;date&quot; with Muraki, and the series follows the relationship between these three characters, supported and embellished by the rest of the cast.

==Media==
===Manga===
The manga was serialized in Hakusensha&#x27;s semi-monthly shōjo manga magazine, &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; from the 14th issue of 1996 until the author decided to put the story on hiatus in the 2nd issue of 2003. The published chapters have been collected in 12 volumes with the 12th volume published on January 19, 2010 with revisions that differ from the chapters originally serialized in the magazine. The series resumed serialization in &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; magazine in the September 2011 issue. The English-language version is published by Viz Media that originally released the first volume on September 14, 2004, and the eleventh on May 2, 2006. From volume 10 onwards the English edition adjusts the chapter enumeration, giving the Japanese and English editions different chapter numbers.





===Anime===
An anime adaptation of the manga aired on WOWOW beginning on October 10, 2000, to June 24, 2001. The anime was directed by Hiroko Tokita and was animated by J.C. Staff. The series was divided by four story arcs. Central Park Media had licensed the series and released them on DVD in 2003. The series initially aired on AZN Television in 2004. In 2008, the series, along with a few other CPM titles, was aired on Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s Ani-Monday block in 2008 and then on their sister network Chiller in 2009. In Canada, the anime series was shown on Super Channel 2 beginning on December 8, 2008. Discotek Media has since licensed the anime and will re-release the series in 2015. The series opening theme is &quot;Eden&quot; by To Destination, while the closing theme is &quot;Love Me&quot; by The Hong Kong Knife.

==Reception==

&quot;Descendants of Darkness&quot; has been called &quot;a gateway drug into shōnen-ai and yaoi&quot; despite it not really being as such. Anime News Network praised the TV series&#x27; humor.
&quot;Descendants of Darkness&quot; sold 10,000 copies in its first few months on the English-language market. Volume 5 of the series ranked 6th in the week ending of May 22, 2005, according to BookScan&#x27;s Graphic Novel List.

<text>The Halcyon is a home video game console produced by RDI Video Systems. The system was planned to be released in January 1985, with the initial retail price for the system being (). Fewer than a dozen units are known to exist and it never reached most retailers because of a lack of affordable disc players. The design featured a LaserDisc player and an attached computer, each the size of an early-model VCR. Of the six games planned, only two games were released: &quot;Thayer&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;NFL Football LA Raiders vs SD Chargers&quot;. RDI Video Systems claimed that the system would be entirely voice-activated, and would have an artificial intelligence akin to HAL 9000 from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

==History==
Rick Dyer was one of the many fans of the interactive fiction game, &quot;Adventure&quot;, and wanted to develop his own game, Shadoan, which was an expansive fantasy game inspired by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. System costs were intended to range from $1,800 to $2,100 (equivalent to $ to $ in ), depending on the model.

Although there wasn&#x27;t a nationwide release, a few consoles were sold at Beverly Stereo and Video for $2,498 and later on clearance for $999. It was sold at Video Scene in San Diego, California for $1,898.

The console is on display at the National Videogame Museum in Frisco, Texas.

==Technical details==

===Hardware===
Halcyon was based around the Z80 microprocessor, with its 64K memory partitioned out to ROM and RAM. A separate speech recognition computer provided the additional power needed to recognize human speech. Its firmware was proprietary, and its chief communications with the Z80 were indications of what word it had recognized, and what probability of confidence it calculated for the match. Other functions this subsystem provided were non-volatile memory storage, and speech recognition training.

Video content existed on a special computer-controlled CED player provided by RCA. Because of video encoding and stylus positioning constraints inherent in this technology, still frames (where action would be suspended pending player input) had to be encoded as a repeat of 2 or 3 seconds of video. Late in its development, Halcyon had to be re-designed to use Laserdisc players because CED units were put out of production by RCA. The Laserdisc player used by Halcyon was an unbadged unit made by Pioneer Corporation.

Communications with CED players were serial. Communications with Laserdisc players were via infrared LED attached via suction cup.

Speech synthesis was produced using a licensed text-to-speech algorithm included as part of the base Halcyon Operating System, including a special English vocabulary which would correctly pronounce hundreds of proper names. The phonetic output of this algorithm was fed into a Votrax chip.

===Software===
Firmware unique to the game being played existed as a removable ROM cartridge containing 16K memory, including the entire game node layout, vocabulary of the game (both for the speech synthesizer and speech recognizer), inventory data (both for gameplay as well as video still frames depicting items), and certain executable data sections to assist in the processing of game flow.

Save for the words &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;, Halcyon required each player to train it to recognize their voice. The words &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; existed as four samples of human voices pre-loaded into memory, two female and two male. Each voice was selected for their unique pitch and timbre properties. These four gave a high probability match for Halcyon to recognize from any given English speaker.

Speech recognition was discontiguous, meaning the player had only a few seconds to speak into a headset when prompted. This headset was equipped with a noise-canceling microphone to help isolate speech from any other sounds. Speech samples would be compared against allowed responses, and a match, along with probability of accuracy, would be sent to the Halcyon main processor.

To acknowledge voice commands, Halcyon would reiterate what it believed it &quot;heard&quot; the player say. This sometimes resulted in incorrect actions taken, especially if the player had a significantly different inflection or spoke something different from the choices expected. Probability ranking could trigger Halcyon to ask the player to repeat their choice when it received a poor match to all expected responses. Mis-recognitions were chiefly the result of a sample of speech given sufficient probability to match one of the anticipated words or phrases.

Halcyon was intended to have a voice much like the Hal 9000, but memory constraints prohibited the use of tailored speech parameters for the Votrax synthesizer that was built into the console. The compromise was to use a licensed text-to-speech algorithm that had several built-in rules for pronouncing English text properly. Modified spellings were also used where needed to correct pronunciation issues, though this did not apply to words such as user names typed by the player.

A video game would follow a general design of &quot;nodes&quot;, which interconnected based on responses and lack of responses from a player. Certain triggers, such as a real-time constraint under which the game would be interrupted if its associated event did not occur, were also part of the game&#x27;s dynamic.

Scenes existed as two or more scripts: One for the &quot;normal&quot; or first encounter with the scene, one for subsequent visits, and optionally one or two for where certain actions required the scene animation or graphics to deviate, usually where an item has been removed or used.

A scene had to be identical in animation and graphics between its normal and subsequent visit, differing only in the audio track used. For this reason, lip sync typically could not be used, often resulting in speaking characters having their mouths obscured or speaking with their backs turned.

A scene with an item used or removed would have separate animation and graphics, allowing for 2 additional audio tracks, again without lip sync.

Audio tracks were encoded into the left and right channels of a stereo encoding; therefore, only monaural audio would be played from any given instance of a scene.

Almost all scenes in a game would have some information revealed that would contribute to solving the puzzle of obtaining the final goal of the game. Since Halcyon needed to keep track of first versus subsequent visits, a count of visits (up to a maximum of 15) would be used to trigger its speech synthesized hints and comments. One example from &quot;Thayer&#x27;s Quest&quot; would be the direct instruction to take the right door when the wrong door (leading to instant death) was chosen more than once.

To break up the monotony of robotic speech, Halcyon was given prompt and response phrases that had markers that would include interchangeable words and phrases, along with the player&#x27;s name, which it would include occasionally. &quot;Enter your name on my keyboard&quot; and &quot;Please spell your name&quot; would be two examples of phrases it would use to prompt the player.

Halcyon&#x27;s game authoring method would easily accommodate playing &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, except for the restraint that speech recognition would take too long to process each move before the time allowed would expire, limiting it to keyboard-only use. This game&#x27;s inclusion was not considered for this reason as well as license restrictions.

Each player&#x27;s game record was represented in non-volatile memory as the set of items they had in their inventory, the visit counters of all possible nodes in the game (unvisited nodes having a count of zero), the scene toggle information (item used / taken / etc.), applicable timers (real-time events would suspend when games were saved), and their trained speech sampled data. To resume play, all one had to do was speak their name when asked to do so by Halcyon.

<text>The Naugatuck River Valley is the watershed area of the Naugatuck River in the western part of Connecticut. The Naugatuck Valley straddles parts of Litchfield County, New Haven, and Fairfield counties. The Route 8 corridor and Waterbury Branch of the Metro-North railroad line run along the river valley. Geographically, it comprises the municipalities located within the Naugatuck River basin. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the area was one of the main manufacturing centers in New England, and most of the communities around the river were emblematic New England mill towns.

==Subdivisions==
Traditionally, the Naugatuck Valley is often subdivided for historical, cultural, geographic, and demographic reasons.

*The Upper Naugatuck Valley, more often referred to as the Litchfield (Northwest) Hills, refers to the area centered on the city of Torrington. The West Branch and East Branch Naugatuck Rivers merge in Torrington to form the main river. The watershed area in the Upper Naugatuck Valley includes parts of the towns of Goshen, Harwinton, Litchfield, Morris, New Hartford, Norfolk, Torrington, Winchester.
*The Central Naugatuck Valley, more often referred to as the Greater Waterbury area, is the region focused on the city of Waterbury. The towns covered in part by the watershed area are Thomaston, Plymouth, Bristol, Bethlehem, Watertown, Woodbury, Wolcott, Waterbury, Middlebury, Cheshire, Prospect, and Naugatuck, Beacon Falls, and Oxford. The last three towns are sometimes also grouped with the lower valley region.
*The Lower Naugatuck Valley refers to the area focused on the city of Derby. The towns within the watershed area of the lower valley are Shelton, Seymour, Woodbridge, Ansonia, and Derby. The towns of Beacon Falls, Oxford, and Naugatuck, usually grouped together in the central valley region, are also sometimes assigned to the lower valley region.

==Towns and cities==
The following municipalities are members of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments (NVCOG):
*Ansonia
*Beacon Falls
*Bethlehem
*Bristol
*Cheshire
*Derby
*Middlebury
*Naugatuck
*Oxford
*Plymouth
*Prospect
*Seymour
*Shelton
*Southbury
*Thomaston
*Waterbury
*Watertown
*Wolcott
*Woodbury

<text>The Nintendo Comics System was a series of comic books published by Valiant Comics in 1990 and 1991. It was part of a licensing deal with Nintendo, featuring characters from their video games and the cartoons based on them.

== The comics ==
Valiant Comics&#x27;s Nintendo Comics System series of comic books was published between 1990 and 1991. The comics are based upon Nintendo video game and television intellectual property from &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Game Boy, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, and &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;.

Valiant&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; comic books are based on the three main Mario games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;. It features the five main characters from the games and cartoon: Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool (as the name Peach was not known in America at the time until &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; in 1993), Toad, and Bowser as &quot;King Koopa&quot;. Wart (the main villain from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;), the Koopalings, and the viruses from &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; also make minor appearances. New characters are also featured for these comics, including: Stanley the Talking Fish, an annoying fish who often pesters Mario about his dating problems; King Toadstool, the Princess&#x27; father, who is not very intelligent; and Wooster, the king&#x27;s much smarter and more sensible advisor. One particular character created for the comics is Dirk Drain-Head, a comic book superhero favored by Mario and all of Bowser&#x27;s minions, and disliked by most other characters. Mario&#x27;s line was renewed for 1991, in which he has two different books: &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Adventures of the Super Mario Bros.&quot;

The stand-alone &quot;Game Boy&quot; comic books, despite having that title, are based solely on &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; since it was the only Game Boy adventure game around at the time. It ended at four issues. The stories feature an original character named Herman Smirch, a quasi-hero of the storyline. He is an ill-willed character whom Tatanga—the villain of source game—could easily hypnotize into doing his bidding due to the bitterness in the man&#x27;s cynical soul. In each issue, Smirch releases Tatanga and his minions into the real world, and a child then releases a tiny Mario to battle them.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; is based on the two Zelda games released on the NES at the time as well as the animated series that aired alongside on &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;.

&quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; is based on the animated series of the same name but with some major differences. All third-party characters are excluded due to Valiant not licensing them from Capcom and Konami as the creators of the animated series had done, but the characters made for the show (Kevin Keene, Princess Lana, Duke, and King Charles), as well as Pit, remain. Simon Belmont and Mega Man are replaced by Samus Aran, the &quot;Metroid&quot; heroine who does not appear in the cartoon, and Mother Brain&#x27;s second-in-command is Uranos, the demigod from &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;. For unexplained reasons, Pit&#x27;s toga is bleached yellow, and in most of the stories, Lana&#x27;s dress is purple. However, she has a weapon: the scepter she had in concept art but never featured on the show. The comics retain some of the creative license taken by the cartoon&#x27;s creators for elements of the original game (i.e., Metroid being a place, King Hippo being blue, Mother Brain&#x27;s appearance).

&quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; appear as stories in the graphic novel-like issues, and do not have their own books. Samus is portrayed as self-serving and interested in Captain N.

<text>The Claxton Bakery is a confectionery company based in Claxton, Georgia.

==History==
The Claxton Bakery was founded by Savino Gillio-Tos (March 31, 1885 in Ivrea, Italy - January 1966 in Claxton, Georgia) who immigrated to the United States in 1902. He moved to New York City, where he worked at a Brooklyn hotel as a master baker. He eventually took a job in Macon, Georgia and moved from there to Claxton. Mr. Gillio-Tos&#x27;s Claxton Bakery was a successful maker of baked goods, homemade ice cream and fruitcakes. In 1945, Savino Gillio-Tos sold the bakery to Albert Parker, an employee, and retired.

===Albert Parker&#x27;s Claxton Bakery===
Under Parker&#x27;s leadership, the Claxton Bakery began to focus on fruitcakes; this eventually led the bakery to start selling fruitcakes for fundraising purposes in the 1950s. One of the bakery&#x27;s earliest fundraising partners was Civitan International; since 1951, local Civitans have sold millions of pounds of Claxton fruitcake each holiday season in support of their work with the developmentally disabled. A little over a decade later, in 1964 and 1965, the company was part of the New York World&#x27;s Fair. Mr. Parker quickly took advantage of the success at the fair and came up with other means to get his product out to the world. One such innovation came when he entered several floats in the Orange Bowl Jamboree Parade in Miami and also the Cherry Blossom Festival Parade in Washington, D.C. Today the Claxton Bakery, Inc. works with over a thousand organizations throughout North America.

On May 21, 1995, Albert Parker died. His three sons and his daughter now run the corporation.

<doc id="1310752" wikidata="Q5085621" url="?curid=1310752" title="Charlie Trotter">
<text>Charlie Trotter (September 8, 1959 – November 5, 2013) was an American chef and restaurateur. His best-known restaurant, Charlie Trotter&#x27;s, was open in Chicago from 1987 to 2012.

==Early life and education==
Trotter was born in Wilmette, Illinois and graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. He attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois from 1977 to 1979, and then transferred to University of Wisconsin–Madison. Trotter started cooking professionally in 1982 after earning a political science bachelor&#x27;s degree from UW–Madison.

==Career==
For five years after college, he worked and studied in Chicago, San Francisco (at the California Culinary Academy), Florida and Europe. He opened his first restaurant in Chicago with his father, Bob Trotter, as his partner.

Trotter was the host of the 1999 PBS cooking show &quot;The Kitchen Sessions with Charlie Trotter,&quot; in which he details his recipes and cooking techniques. He likened cooking to an improvisational jazz session in that as two riffs will never be the same, so too with food. He also wrote 14 cookbooks and three management books, and promoted a line of organic and all-natural gourmet foods distributed nationally.

Trotter was involved with his philanthropic &quot;Charlie Trotter Culinary Education Foundation&quot; and other causes. He was awarded the Humanitarian of the Year award in 2005 by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. He invited groups of public high school students into his restaurant as part of his Excellence Program two to three times per week: after eating a meal, the students were told how the food was prepared and the motivations of those preparing it.

Trotter also was unusual among celebrity chefs for his outspokenness in matters of ethics, most famously when he took foie gras off the menu in 2002 for ethical reasons. However, Trotter refused to be associated with the animal rights group Farm Sanctuary stating, &quot;These people are idiots. Understand my position: I have nothing to do with a group like that. I think they&#x27;re pathetic. … [S]ome of their tactics are crude and uncivilized even.&quot;

Trotter made a cameo appearance in the 1997 film &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, screaming at an assistant, &quot;I will kill your whole family if you don&#x27;t get this right! I need this perfect!&quot; a parody of a stereotypical screaming angry chef.

==Restaurants==


* &quot;Charlie Trotter&#x27;s&quot; restaurant in Chicago opened in 1987. It was named as the 30th-best restaurant in the world by Restaurant Magazine, and 5th-best in the United States in 2007. In 2010 Charlie Trotter&#x27;s was one of three restaurants in Chicago to be awarded two stars by the Michelin Guide. In the following year&#x27;s Michelin Guide, the restaurant again was rated with two stars. On December 31, 2011, Trotter announced that the restaurant would close in August 2012, citing a desire to travel and to pursue a master&#x27;s degree.

* Trotter also owned &quot;Trotter&#x27;s To Go&quot; at 1337 W. Fullerton, a high-end delicatessen and catering store in Lincoln Park, Chicago. This closed in July 2012.
* In 2008, Trotter opened his second namesake restaurant in Las Vegas known as &quot;Restaurant Charlie&quot;. The restaurant garnered extraordinary praise from critics and received the Michelin Guide One Star award in 2009. The restaurant also received the 2009 James Beard Award for &quot;Best New Restaurant&quot;. Within the restaurant was a smaller, private bar known as &quot;Bar Charlie&quot; in which diners were seated overlooking the kitchen preparation and received a hands-on experience. It closed in March 2010.
* In 2004, Trotter opened &quot;C&quot;, a seafood restaurant in Los Cabos, Mexico. It closed in November 2008.
* Trotter had planned to open a restaurant in New York City in a new building being built at One Madison Park, but a foreclosure crisis prevented it.
*In 2014, Trotter&#x27;s son, Dylan, and Trotter’s mother, Dona-Lee Trotter, announced that the nonprofit Trotter Project would open in the original Charlie Trotter&#x27;s restaurant space on Armitage Avenue. Though the buildings had been put on the market after the restaurant closed in 2012, they were taken off the market. As of 2024, the project&#x27;s stated mission is: &quot;The Trotter Project nourishes dreams, transforms lives and empowers communities through food, education, and community initiatives&quot;.

==Lawsuits==
Trotter was the subject of a number of lawsuits. In 2003 he was the subject of two class action lawsuits pertaining to the compensation of his employees and alleged violations of labor law, both front-of-the-house (service) and back-of-the-house (cooks). The first, filed by former waiter Kurt Sorensen, alleges that rather than receiving the tips they collected, waiters were paid from a restaurant-wide pool, and their share was significantly lower than the amount they had collected, in violation of minimum wage law. This suit was settled out of court. The second, filed September 17, 2003 by former cook Beverly Kim, alleged that cooks were required to work unpaid overtime. This suit was settled in 2005, resulting in a liability of almost $700,000, though of this only about $300,000 was paid out, as many eligible former employees returned their share.

On June 13, 2013, Trotter was sued by brothers and wine collectors Bekim and Ilir Frrokaj, who accused him of selling them a counterfeit bottle of 1945 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti for $46,000; Trotter denied any wrongdoing.

==Personal life==
Trotter married his first wife, Lisa Ehrlich, on August 31, 1986. They met in 1981 at University of Wisconsin–Madison. Lisa helped open the restaurant and served as its first dining room manager and wine director until the couple divorced in August 1990.

Trotter&#x27;s second marriage, to Lynn Thomas, produced a son, Dylan, born on May 24, 1991 (Bob Dylan&#x27;s 50th birthday), who was 22 years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death.

In February 2010, Trotter married girlfriend Rochelle Smith, who later became his publicist.

In 2021, a feature-length documentary about his life, titled &quot;Love, Charlie: The Rise and Fall of Chef Charlie Trotter&quot;, was released in the United States.

==Death and legacy==
On November 5, 2013, Trotter&#x27;s son Dylan found him unresponsive in their Lincoln Park home. Trotter was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead as a result of a stroke. Former understudy Graham Elliot called Trotter a &quot;mentor, trailblazer, philosopher, artist, teacher [and] leader.&quot;
Charlie Trotter&#x27;s spirit of mentorship continues via The Trotter Project, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization created by family, co-workers and friends including Homaro Cantu, Trotter&#x27;s mother Dona-Lee, sister Anne, brothers Scott and Tom, and his son Dylan.

<text>Hollyweird is the sixth studio album by American glam metal band Poison, released through Cyanide Music on May 21, 2002. It debuted at No. 103 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 8 on the Independent Albums chart and sold 11,000 copies in its first week. As of 2023, it is the band&#x27;s most recent album of original material.

== Musical style ==
The record brought together Poison&#x27;s original lineup for the first full studio project since &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;. The result was a combination of old and new sounds, with guitarist C.C. DeVille frequently preferring pop and punk rock sounds to the heavy metal style that had characterized Poison&#x27;s previous records. The band&#x27;s new style was particularly evident in the songs &quot;Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; In the Now&quot; and &quot;Home (C.C&#x27;s Story)&quot;, which featured DeVille on lead vocals.

== Production and marketing ==
In the face of major label offers that would have required the band to re-record old material, the band decided to release the album through their own label, Cyanide Music. &quot;Hollyweird&quot; was recorded at Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood, California and Rock Central Studios in Sherman Oaks, California with producer Thom Panunzio and engineer Bob Koszela.

== Songs ==
The album&#x27;s themes revolve almost exclusively around the trials and tribulations of success in Hollywood, California—a theme that had previously been explored in the band&#x27;s single &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; from their second album &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot;.

The first single released from the album was &quot;Rockstar&quot;, which was released on the web as a preview for the album; the second single was a cover of &quot;The Who&quot; song &quot;Squeeze Box&quot;.

Bobby Dall on The Who cover &quot;Squeeze Box&quot;:
&quot;Shooting Star&quot; was also released as a single for the album and was referred to as part 2 to the &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; single from &quot;Open Up and...Say Ahh&quot;.

<text>Lloyd George Hyde (April 24, 1920 in Burnside, Manitoba – August 25, 1985) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 until his death in 1985.

==Early life==
The son of Joseph Hyde and Frances Troop, he was educated in Burnside and Portage la Prairie and worked as a farmer after attending high school. He also served with an artillery unit in the Canadian Forces from 1941 to 1945. Hyde subsequently became a Director of the Portage Industrial Exhibition and an Associate Member of the Portage la Prairie District Planning Scheme, as well as a freemason. He also was an active member of the local Barber Quartet Society. In 1946, Hyde married Isabel Margaret Spriggs.

== Political career ==
He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1977 election, defeating his New Democratic opponent by about 1,500 votes in the riding of Portage la Prairie. The Tories won a majority government in this election, although Hyde was not appointed to the cabinet of Premier Sterling Lyon.

The Tories were defeated in the provincial election of 1981, although Hyde easily retained his own riding. He continued serving as an MLA until his death in 1985.

<doc id="1310760" wikidata="Q493754" url="?curid=1310760" title="Leapfrogging">
<text>Leapfrogging is a concept used in many domains of the economics and business fields, and was originally developed in the area of industrial organization and economic growth. The main idea behind the concept of leapfrogging is that small and incremental innovations lead a dominant firm to stay ahead. However, sometimes, radical innovations will permit new firms to leapfrog the ancient and dominant firm. The phenomenon can occur to firms but also to leadership of countries or cities, where a developing country can skip stages of the path taken by industrial nations, enabling them to catch up sooner, particularly in terms of economic growth.

==Industrial organization==
In the field of industrial organization (IO), the main work on leapfrogging was developed by Fudenberg, Gilbert, Stiglitz and Tirole (1983). In their article, they analyze under which conditions a new entrant can leapfrog an established firm. 

That leapfrogging can arise because an established monopolist has a somewhat reduced incentive to innovate because he is earning rents from the old technology. This is somewhat based on Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s notion of ‘gales of creative destruction’. The hypothesis proposes that companies holding monopolies based on incumbent technologies have less incentive to innovate than potential rivals, and therefore they eventually lose their technological leadership role when new radical technological innovations are adopted by new firms which are ready to take the risks. When the radical innovations eventually become the new technological paradigm, the newcomer companies leapfrog ahead of the formerly leading firms.

==International competition==
Similarly a country which has leadership can lose its hegemony and be leapfrogged by another country. This has happened in history a few times. In the late eighteenth century, the Netherlands was leapfrogged by the UK, which was the leader during the whole nineteenth century, and in turn the US leapfrogged the UK, and became the hegemonic power of the 20th century.

There are several reasons for this. Brezis and Krugman (1993, 1997) suggest a mechanism that explains this pattern of &quot;leapfrogging&quot; as a response to occasional major changes in technology. In times of small and incremental technological change, increasing returns to scale tend to accentuate economic leadership. However, at times of a radical innovation and major technological breakthrough, economic leadership, since it also implies high wages, can deter the adoption of new ideas in the most advanced countries. A new technology may well seem initially inferior to older methods to those who have extensive experience with those older methods; yet that initially inferior technology may well have more potential for improvements and adaptation. When technological progress takes this form, economic leadership will tend to be the source of its own downfall.

In consequence, when a radical innovation occurs, it does not initially seem to be an improvement for leading nations, given their extensive experience with older technologies. Lagging nations have less experience; the new technique allows them to use their lower wages to enter the market. If the new technique proves more productive than the old, leapfrogging of leadership occurs.

Brezis and Krugman have applied this theory of leapfrogging to the field of geography, and explain why leading cities are often overtaken by upstart metropolitan areas. Such upheavals may be explained if the advantage of established urban centers rests on localized learning by doing. When a new technology is introduced, for which this accumulated experience is irrelevant, older centers prefer to stay with a technology in which they are more efficient. The changes to technological leadership can reveal the challenges concerning the effects of backwardness on the willingness to innovate or adopt radical and new ideas. New centers, however, turn to the new technology and are competitive despite the raw state of that technology because of their lower land rents and wages. Over time, as the new technology matures, the established cities are overtaken.

==Leapfrogging in developing countries==
More recently the concept of leapfrogging is being used in the context of sustainable development for developing countries as a theory of development which may accelerate development by skipping inferior, less efficient, more expensive or more polluting technologies and industries and move directly to more advanced ones.

Leapfrog democracies can refer to countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later. 

The mobile phone is an example of a “leapfrog” technology: it has enabled developing countries to skip the fixed-line technology of the 20th century and move straight to the mobile technology of the 21st. It is proposed that through leapfrogging developing countries can avoid environmentally harmful stages of development and do not need to follow the polluting development trajectory of industrialized countries. 

The adoption of solar energy technologies in developing countries are examples of where countries do not repeat the mistakes of highly industrialized countries in creating an energy infrastructure based on fossil fuels, but &quot;jump&quot; directly into the Solar Age.

Developing countries with existing natural gas pipelines in place can use it to transport hydrogen instead, hence leapfrogging from natural gas to hydrogen.

==Tunneling through==
A closely related concept is that of ‘tunneling through’ the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The concept proposes that developing countries could learn from the experiences of industrialized nations, and restructure growth and development to address potentially irreversible environmental damages from an early stage and thereby ‘tunnel’ through any prospective EKC. Environmental quality thereby does not have to get worse before it gets better and crossing safe limits or environmental thresholds can be avoided. Although in principle the concepts of leapfrogging (focused on jumping technological generations) and tunnelling through (focused on pollution) are distinct, in practice they tend to be conflated.

==Millennium Development Goals==
The concept of environmental leapfrogging also includes a social dimension. The diffusion and application of environmental technologies would not only reduce environmental impacts, but can at the same time contribute to sustainable economic development and the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by promoting greater access to resources and technologies to people who currently have no access. Regarding electricity currently nearly one third of the world population has no access to electricity and another third has only poor access. Reliance on traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating can have a serious impact on health and the environment. There is not only a direct positive link between sustainable renewable energy technologies and climate change mitigation, but also between clean energy and issues of health, education and gender equity.

==Examples==
A frequently cited example is countries which move directly from having no telephones to having cellular phones, skipping the stage of copperwire landline telephones altogether.

Another notable example is mobile payment. China is one of the world&#x27;s leaders in consumer internet and mobile payments. In most parts of the developed world, credit cards have been popular since the second half of 20th century but were not widespread in China. After 2013, Alipay and WeChat began to support mobile payment using QR code on smart phones. Both of them have been extremely successful in China and are expanding overseas now. China&#x27;s technological leapfrogging to mobile payments also led to a boom in online shopping and retail banking. The expansion of e-commerce in China is another example of leapfrogging development. Although China was a latecomer to e-Commerce in comparison to other major economies, it has now grown beyond them in both total market size and on a per capita basis.

==Necessary conditions==
Leapfrogging can occur accidentally, when the only systems around for adoption are better than legacy systems elsewhere, or situationally, such as the adoption of decentralized communication for a sprawling, rural countryside.
It may also be initiated intentionally, e.g. by policies promoting the installation of WiFi and free computers in poor urban areas.

The Reut Institute has carried out extensive research regarding the common denominators of all the different countries that have successfully &#x27;leapt&#x27; in recent years. It concludes that to leapfrog a country needs to create a shared vision, leadership by a committed elite, &#x27;Inclusive growth&#x27;, relevant institutions, a labor market suited to cope with rapid growth and changes, growth diagnostics of the country&#x27;s bottlenecks and focused reforms as well as local and regional development and national mobilization.

==Promotion by international initiatives==

Japan&#x27;s Low-Carbon Society 2050 Initiative has the objective to cooperate with and offer support to Asian developing countries to leapfrog towards a low-carbon energy future.

<doc id="1310764" wikidata="Q996472" url="?curid=1310764" title="East Tsim Sha Tsui station">
<text>East Tsim Sha Tsui () is a station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system of Hong Kong. It is currently an intermediate station on the .

The station was built to alleviate surface traffic jams and passenger congestion at Kowloon Tong station. The distance from to the station is about one kilometre with the journey time of around two minutes.

This station is linked with Tsim Sha Tsui station of the by subways (underground pedestrian tunnels).

==History==
The predecessor of the East Rail line was the Kowloon–Canton Railway (British Section), which was opened in 1910. At the time of opening, its southern terminus was the located in Tsim Sha Tsui, where the Clock Tower stands today. However, the old Kowloon station was closed in 1975, and the southern terminus of the railway was relocated to the newly built Hung Hom station.

An early predecessor to the present East Tsim Sha Tsui station, named Mariner in the East Kowloon line 1970 scheme, was intended to provide interchange to of the Kong Kow line (now part of ).

Plans for East Tsim Sha Tsui were subsequently revived in 1993 when the plans for East Kowloon line were modified to become a medium-capacity system as part of an Eastern Corridor with transfer to the Lantau Airport Railway (now and ). The contract to construct East Tsim Sha Tsui was subsequently awarded to a consortium consisting of Hong Kong-based Gammon Construction and Japan-based Nishimatsu.

East Tsim Sha Tsui was opened on 24 October 2004 as a southward extension of the KCR East Rail from , the Tsim Sha Tsui Extension, marking the return of the railway to the Tsim Sha Tsui area after 30 years. It served as the southern terminus of the East Rail line until 16 August 2009. As a result of its underground location, the station was equipped with full-height platform screen doors, of the same type used on the KCR West Rail, which opened the year prior. The station was the only one on the East Rail line with these doors for five years, and as a result, the 12-car-long set of screen doors were the longest in the world.

The status of the East Tsim Sha Tsui station as the southern terminus of the East Rail line was intended to be a temporary arrangement only. Upon the opening of the MTR Kowloon Southern Link on 16 August 2009, the East Rail line terminated in the south at Hung Hom again (albeit only temporary until the opening of Sha Tin to Central Link in 2022), and the tracks between Hung Hom and East Tsim Sha Tsui became part of the . As a result, Hung Hom became the common southern terminus of (and provided cross-platform interchange between) the East Rail line and the West Rail line, whilst East Tsim Sha Tsui became an intermediate station on the West Rail line. Due to the shorter length of the Tuen Ma line trains (8 cars), the ends of the platforms were taken out of use and closed off.

On 27 June 2021, the officially merged with the (which was already extended into the &quot;Tuen Ma line Phase 1&quot; at the time) in East Kowloon to form the new , as part of the Shatin to Central link project. Hence, East Tsim Sha Tsui was included in the project and is now an intermediate station on the Tuen Ma line.

==Station layout==

Passengers heading towards the Tsuen Wan line ride the escalator up to the concourse and leave the Tuen Ma line system. Then they walk along the Middle Road or Mody Road subway system respectively to reach Tsim Sha Tsui station at exits L2 and M3, respectively.

Although the stations are connected by subway, the fare gates for East Tsim Sha Tsui and Tsim Sha Tsui stations are separated. Single journey ticket passengers transferring from the Tuen Ma line to the Tsuen Wan line must purchase a second ticket at Tsim Sha Tsui station as the ticket is withdrawn once the passengers exit through the turnstiles at East Tsim Sha Tsui station. In contrast, Octopus card users who transfer between East Tsim Sha Tsui and Tsim Sha Tsui stations within thirty minutes without making any other transport related purchases or more than nine non-transport related purchases in between stations are considered to have taken a single journey and are charged accordingly. Also, MTR City Saver users who transfer between East Tsim Sha Tsui and Tsim Sha Tsui stations within thirty minutes are considered to have taken a single journey and no extra journey will be charged.

==Entrances/exits==
East Tsim Sha Tsui station is linked with Tsim Sha Tsui station through the Mody Road and Middle Road subways. When both stations&#x27; exits are combined, the total number of exits outnumber even that of Central. Tsim Sha Tsui station has the exit with the highest letter of all rail stations in Hong Kong.

There&#x27;s no exits I or O because of the confusion with 1 and 0 respectively.

<doc id="1310766" wikidata="Q1746037" url="?curid=1310766" title="Taber, Alberta">
<text>Taber is a town in southern Alberta, Canada that is surrounded by the Municipal District of Taber. It is approximately east of the City of Lethbridge at the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 36.

Taber is famous for its corn due to the large amounts of sunshine the area receives. It is therefore known as the &quot;Corn Capital of Canada&quot; and holds an annual &quot;Cornfest&quot; in the last week of August.

== History ==
Originally, Taber was known as &quot;Tank No. 77,&quot; and was used by the railway to fill up on water. In 1903, it is said that the first Mormon settlers from the U.S. were the ones to establish a hamlet at the Tank. After the town&#x27;s post office was built in 1907, the CPR decided to call the town &quot;Tabor,&quot; probably after Mount Tabor in the Holy Land. However, various letters and station heads came out printed &quot;Taber,&quot; so the CPR changed the name to make it match the records.

An alternate version of the town&#x27;s name origin is that the first part of the word tabernacle was used by Mormon settlers in the vicinity, and the next Canadian Pacific Railway station was named Elcan (nacle spelled backwards).

After time, Taber became a successful coal mining town. Coal mining declined in the late 1920s, but picked up in the 1930s after extensive irrigation in the area.

During the Second World War, Japanese Canadians were forcibly relocated to Alberta where some were compelled into forced labor, many in sugar beet cultivation, for the duration of the war.

Irrigation helped not only the coal miners, it also brought with it the production of sugar beets. In 1950, a sugar beet processing plant (Roger&#x27;s Sugar) was built, which has become a vital part of the town&#x27;s economy.

A number of archaeological discoveries were made in the vicinity of Taber, including that of extinct buffalo, and the so-called &quot;Taber child&quot; in 1961 by the head of a Geological Survey of Canada team Dr. Archie Stalker in the glacial deposits along the east bank of the Oldman River.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Taber experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). The highest temperature ever recorded in Taber was on 17 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 23 January 1969.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Taber had a population of 8,862 living in 3,347 of its 3,481 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 8,428. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The population of the Town of Taber according to its 2020 municipal census is 8,711, a change from its 2015 municipal census population of 8,380.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Taber recorded a population of 8,428 living in 3,159 of its 3,384 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 8,104. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Economy ==
Taber&#x27;s economy is largely based on agriculture. Local produce includes pigs, beef, sheep, poultry, sugar beets, potatoes, peas, carrots, wheat, flax, barley, corn, beans, sunflowers, oats, onions, canola and mustard.

Roger&#x27;s Sugar is Taber&#x27;s sugar beet processing plant, built in 1950. Lantic Inc., owns and operates the factory. There are several food processing companies based in the town, including a Frito-Lay factory, which produces various snack products for much of Western Canada. As well, sand and gravel are mined here. To a lesser extent, there is also a significant oil and gas component to the economy.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Cornfest ===
Cornfest is an annual summer festival held on the last full weekend in August, and includes a midway (rides, booths, and tests of skill) and a stage with performers. It is the largest free family festival in Western Canada, and is organized by the Taber and District Chamber of Commerce. There are a number of corn-based activities, such as corn tasting and stuffing. Corn stuffing involves two people, one wearing an oversized coverall. One of the contestants attempts to stuff as much corn as possible into the other&#x27;s coverall. Whichever team can put the most corn in the coveralls in the allotted time wins. During Cornfest, large-scale, local corn producers enter their best varieties in the &#x27;Best Corn of the Year&#x27; award.

Taber is home to one of the Canada 150 Mosaic murals. It depicts Tank 77 within a field of corn, and the tiles were painted by members of the community. The mural was unveiled in December 2016, and is housed within the Taber Health Clinic.

== Government ==

The Town of Taber gained notoriety when it adopted a bylaw on February 23, 2015, that granted the police and bylaw officials the authority to levy fines for controversial actions including swearing, public assembly, spitting and applying graffiti on one&#x27;s own private property. The bylaw also implemented a curfew. The adoption met criticism over its appearance of being unconstitutional; violating freedoms of expression and association protected under Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The town defended its adoption stating the bylaw &quot;is intended to consolidate existing municipal regulations and allow enforcement under a municipal bylaw rather than the Criminal Code&quot; and citing concerns about unnecessary prosecutions clogging the court. Mayor Henk De Vlieger supported the bylaw while stating that town council would review the bylaw after a six-month trial.

=== Taber Police Service ===
The Taber Police Service (TPS) is the municipal police force for the Town of Taber. Graham Abela is the current chief of police. The TPS was established in 1904

== Education ==
Kindergarten through grade 12 education is administered in Taber by the Horizon School Division and Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Division. The two high schools in Taber are W.R. Myers High School and St. Mary&#x27;s School. Taber has a Christian School for kindergarten through grade 9. Other education systems include Community Adult Learning Council, ACE Place Learning Center and a Career Resource Centre.

== Sister cities ==
Taber and Higashiomi are sister towns. In 1981, the Town of Taber and Notogawa, Japan signed the original Twinned Municipalities Agreement. When Notogawa was merged into the City of Higashiomi in 2006, the two municipalities re-signed the Twinning Agreement.

<doc id="1310784" wikidata="Q5249980" url="?curid=1310784" title="Deedee Corradini">
<text>Margaret &quot;Deedee&quot; McMullen Corradini (April 11, 1944 – March 1, 2015) was an American businesswoman and politician who served as the 32nd mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, from 1992 to 2000. Corradini was the first woman to serve as mayor of Salt Lake City.

Corradini, at the time of her death Senior Vice President for Prudential Utah Real Estate, was also the President of Women&#x27;s Ski Jumping-USA. She was on the WSJ-USA board, and served as president for three years, taking a lead role in the battle to get women&#x27;s ski jumping into the Olympic Winter Games.

==Life and career==
Corradini was born Margaret Louise McMullen (although Deedee was a childhood nickname) in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Marie-Louise (Strehlau) and the Rev. Horace &quot;Mac&quot; Martin McMullen. Corradini attended school in Lebanon and Syria for 11 years as a child. She attended Drew University from 1961 to 1963. She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1965 and a Master&#x27;s degree in 1967, both in Psychology from the University of Utah. She served as Press Secretary to Congressman Wayne Owens of Utah and then Rep. Richard Ottinger of New York in the early 1970s.

Although Utah leans strongly toward the Republican party, Corradini was a Democrat. This is not unusual for Salt Lake City, which tends to vote Democratic far more than other regions of Utah.

Corradini was fluent in French and Arabic.

Corradini&#x27;s efforts gave Utah the initial shove that landed the state the 2002 Winter Olympics. Corradini was the first woman to receive the Olympic flag, in front of a television audience of hundreds of millions of viewers, when it was passed to Salt Lake City at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan at the closing ceremonies.

Under Corradini&#x27;s watch, the city&#x27;s population experienced a tremendous growth spurt, as the metropolitan area of Salt Lake City and the rest of the state began to grow by thousands of families a month.

But she also endured scrutiny as a result of the fallout of Bonneville Pacific, a publicly traded alternative energy producer that went through bankruptcy proceedings in 1991. While never an executive of the company, Corradini had been a director, and - facing being dragged into years-long legal proceedings which would cost millions regardless of actual responsibility or outcome - agreed to a settlement of $805,000, a huge amount given that no responsibility or liability had or has ever been shown. Corradini was later criticized for soliciting some $231,000 in cash gifts and loans from friends and acquaintances to help pay the settlement; although insinuations were made, particularly in the alternative press, no serious allegations of impropriety were ever advanced. In January 1999, she announced she would not seek reelection the following year.

The ACLU and the First Unitarian Church of Salt Lake City, among others (including her successor Rocky Anderson), were upset with a deal she negotiated on behalf of the city to sell a block of Main Street — then city property — adjacent to Temple Square to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). However, the conversion of this block into a church plaza was one of the 14 major projects put forth by the city in its 1962 Second Century Plan. The 1962 plan stated: &quot;It is proposed that Main Street between the two church blocks either be closed to vehicular traffic or an underpass installed. This would strongly unify these two blocks as a visual anchor on the north end.&quot; 

During her tenure, Corradini pushed hard (and ultimately successfully) for the relocation of the Union Pacific railroad tracks that divided downtown, pushed through the TRAX light-rail system, and won massive federal funding for reconstruction of the freeway system in advance of the Olympic Games (one of the largest single public works transit projects in recent American history). She also was the guiding force for the construction of the popular baseball stadium for the (then) AAA Salt Lake Buzz, at the time, the farm team for the Minnesota Twins), the redevelopment of a 50-year-old rail yard into the 30-acre (121,000 m2), $375 million The Gateway mixed-use development, resulting in two million square feet (186,000 m2) of shops, restaurants, office space, and housing, a 12-screen movie theatre, the Clark Planetarium, and Discovery Gateway, a children&#x27;s museum.

Corradini served as the President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 1998. She was also President of the International Women&#x27;s Forum, Chair of the Utah Symphony Board of Directors, of which she was a Lifetime Board Member.

Corradini died from lung cancer on March 1, 2015, at the age of 70.

== 2002 Winter Olympics ==
Corradini&#x27;s efforts gave Utah the initial shove that landed the state the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Corradini crisscrossed the globe meeting with International Olympic Committee members for Salt Lake City&#x27;s 2002 bid. She lobbied the Utah Legislature for a voter-approved sales-tax hike to build winter-sports facilities to help lure the Winter Games.

Corradini was the first woman to receive the Olympic flag, in front of a television audience of hundreds of millions of viewers, when it was passed to Salt Lake City at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan at the closing ceremonies.

Corradini was instrumental in adding women&#x27;s bobsleigh and skeleton events to the 2002 Olympics in Utah.

=== Women&#x27;s ski jumping ===
Corradini campaigned for the 2002 Winter Olympics as mayor and then led the effort to bring women&#x27;s ski jumping to the Winter Games. When the International Olympic Committee (IOC) told her and women ski jumpers in 2008 regarding participation in the 2010 Winter Olympics that women would not be allowed to jump, Corradini and other women ski jump advocates then filed suit in Canada, suggesting that exclusion of the event violated the human rights of the athletes. The lawsuit was rejected before the 2010 Winter Olympics. In 2011, based on improvements in performance and participation, the IOC gave its approval to add women&#x27;s ski jumping, starting with the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics. For nearly a decade, Corradini had led the fight, which included an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada when athletes fought for the right to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics.The IOC twice ruled against adding the sport to the Vancouver Games, saying participation worldwide wasn&#x27;t widespread enough.

After women&#x27;s ski jumping was added to the Olympic program, Corradini said: &quot;We have only one event, and that&#x27;s the normal hill jump. The men have normal hill, large hill, the team event and Nordic combined. We&#x27;re already thinking 2018 to become really equal with the men, so we still have our work cut out for us.&quot;

== SLC Transit ==
During her tenure, Corradini pushed hard (and ultimately successfully) for the relocation of the Union Pacific railroad tracks that divided downtown, pushed through the TRAX light-rail system, and won massive federal funding for reconstruction of the freeway system in advance of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games (one of the largest single public works transit projects in recent American history).

Corradini became an early advocate for light rail, which debuted on Main Street in the final year of her mayoral run. She helped lay the groundwork for a transportation hub that connects TRAX, FrontRunner commuter trains and buses in what used to be the city&#x27;s red-light district.

In championing the initial TRAX spur, Corradini ran into stiff resistance from business owners, who balked at having Main Street torn up for months of construction to accommodate the rails.

== Infrastructure ==
Corradini pushed to renovate the blighted west side of the city&#x27;s business district with an ambitious 50-block project that involved moving roads, bridges and freeway corridors. That paved the way for The Gateway shopping and residential center — a $375 million mixed-use development boasting 2 million square feet of shops, restaurants, offices and housing, as well as a 12-screen movie theater, a planetarium and a children&#x27;s museum.

Corradini also led the effort to renovate Salt Lake City International Airport and added a third runway.

<text>Appleton Wiske is a small village and civil parish that sits between Northallerton and Yarm in the Vale of York, a flat tract of land that runs between the North Yorkshire Moors to the east, the Yorkshire Dales to the west and the River Tees to the north.

The village, which was known as Apletona in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, eventually took the name of the nearby River Wiske to distinguish itself from other Appletons in the area, such as Appleton-le-Moors.

==History==
Appleton Wiske - today just a tiny parish within the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire - is actually one of the 41 ancient parishes of the Wapentake of Langbaurgh in the Cleveland division of the North Riding of Yorkshire. It was also a part of the sessional division of Yarm.

The parish was gifted by William the Conqueror to Robert de Brus of Skelton, an ancestor of Robert the Bruce, the famous Scottish king. De Brus&#x27;s son gave it to St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York, along with Hornby and other lands. It remained in the possession of the St. Mary&#x27;s until the dissolution of monasteries, when it was granted by Henry VIII to Charles Brandon, who later became the Duke of Suffolk. The parish then passed through several hands and was finally split up in the early 19th century after the death of Robert Henry Allan, whose family had owned the parish since the early 18th century.

The village is thought to date back to Saxon times and is referred to in the Domesday Book as Apletona. St Mary&#x27;s Church, Appleton Wiske is not quite as old - the first reference to it is in 1299, when Edward I visited and heard Mass. Parish records indicate that it was being called The Chapel of St Mary Magdalen in Appleton by 1586. It is a small Norman structure, consisting of nave, chancel and porch. The church is now a grade II listed structure, as is the Wesleyan Methodist chapel built in 1821.

In the First World War, of land to the north east of the village was used by two squadrons of the Royal Air Force in the Home Defence role. The squadrons were based at RAF Ripon and used Appleton Wiske as a Relief Landing Ground (RLG). Whilst the airfield was scoped out for a possible role in the Second World War, it was never used.

In 2009 it was suggested that a planning application for nine wind turbines was due to be raised with Hambleton District Council. With each turbine planned to be high and the nearest some from the village, a group of villagers formed the still existent North Hambleton Windfarm Action Group (NHWAG) to oppose the development.

==Geography==
The village is north east of Northallerton and south west of Yarm. The River Wiske passes to the immediate south of the village on its long journey to the North Sea at Spurn Head.

==Education==
Appleton Wiske Primary School has a roll of around 80 to 90 pupils with an age range of four to eleven. Children from East Harsley attend Appleton Wiske Primary School alongside children from the village itself. All are in the catchment area for Northallerton School and Sixth Form College.

==Plaudits==
The village won a gold medal in Yorkshire in Bloom in 2006, 2007 and 2008, also winning best village in 2008. Appleton Wiske has also represented Yorkshire and Humberside three times in the national Britain in Bloom competition. In 2002 winning a silver medal, in 2004 a Silver-Gilt and Best Village and in 2009 a gold medal.

<doc id="1310791" wikidata="Q703660" url="?curid=1310791" title="Tom Wesselmann">
<text>Thomas K. Wesselmann (February 23, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American artist associated with the Pop Art movement who worked in painting, collage and sculpture.

==Early years==
Wesselmann was born in Cincinnati.

From 1949 to 1951 he attended college in Ohio; first at Hiram College, and then transferred to major in psychology at the University of Cincinnati. He was drafted into the US Army in 1952, but spent his service years stateside. During that time he made his first cartoons, and became interested in pursuing a career in cartooning. After his discharge he completed his psychology degree in 1954, whereupon he began to study drawing at the Art Academy of Cincinnati. He achieved some initial success when he sold his first cartoon strips to the magazines &quot;1000 Jokes&quot; and &quot;True.&quot;

Cooper Union accepted him in 1956, and he continued his studies in New York. During a visit to the MoMA he was inspired by the Robert Motherwell painting &quot;Elegy to the Spanish Republic&quot;: “The first aesthetic experience… He felt a sensation of high visceral excitement in his stomach, and it seemed as though his eyes and stomach were directly connected”.

Wesselmann also admired the work of Willem de Kooning, but he soon rejected action painting: “He realized he had to find his own passion he felt he had to deny to himself all that he loved in de Kooning, and go in as opposite a direction as possible.&quot;

For Wesselmann, 1958 was a pivotal year. A landscape painting trip to Cooper Union&#x27;s Green Camp in rural New Jersey, brought him to the realization that he could pursue painting, rather than cartooning, as a career.

==Career==
===1959–1964===
After graduation, Wesselmann became one of the founding members of the Judson Gallery, along with Marc Ratliff and Jim Dine, also from Cincinnati, who had just arrived in New York. He and Ratliff showed a number of small collages in a two-man exhibition at Judson Gallery. He began to teach art at a public school in Brooklyn, and later at the High School of Art and Design.

Wesselmann&#x27;s series &quot;Great American Nude&quot; (begun 1961) first brought him to the attention of the art world. After a dream concerning the phrase &quot;red, white, and blue&quot;, he decided to paint a &quot;Great American Nude&quot; in a palette limited to those colors and any colors associated with patriotic motifs such as gold and khaki. The series incorporated representational images with an accordingly patriotic theme, such as American landscape photos and portraits of founding fathers. Often these images were collaged from magazines and discarded posters, which called for a larger format than Wesselmann had used previously. As works began to approach a giant scale he approached advertisers directly to acquire billboards.

Through Henry Geldzahler, Wesselmann met Alex Katz, who offered him a show at the Tanager Gallery. Wesselmann&#x27;s first solo show was held there later that year, representing both the large and small &quot;Great American Nude&quot; collages. In 1962, Richard Bellamy offered him a one-man exhibition at the Green Gallery. About the same time, Ivan Karp of the Leo Castelli Gallery put Wesselmann in touch with several collectors and talked to him about Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist’s works. These Wesselmann viewed without noting any similarities with his own {S. Stealingworth, p. 25}.

While not a cohesive movement, the idea of Pop Art (a name coined by Lawrence Alloway and others) was gradually spreading among international art critics and the public. In As Henry Geldzahler observed: &quot;About a year and a half ago I saw the works of Wesselmann..., Warhol, Rosenquist and Lichtenstein in their studios (it was more or less July 1961). They were working independently, unaware of each other, but drawing on a common source of imagination. In the space of a year and a half they put on exhibitions, created a movement and we are now here discussing the matter in a conference. This is instant history of art, a history of art that became so aware of itself as to make a leap that went beyond art itself&quot;.

The Sidney Janis Gallery held the &quot;New Realists&quot; exhibition in November 1962, which included works by the American artists Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, George Segal, and Andy Warhol; and Europeans such as Arman, Enrico Baj, Christo, Yves Klein, Tano Festa, Mimmo Rotella, Jean Tinguely, and Mario Schifano. It followed the Nouveau Réalisme exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in Paris, and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called Pop Art in Britain and The United States and Nouveau Réalisme on the European continent.
Wesselmann took part in the &quot;New Realist&quot; show with some reservations, exhibiting two 1962 works: &quot;Still life #17&quot; and &quot;Still life #22&quot;.

Wesselmann never liked his inclusion in American Pop Art, pointing out how he made an aesthetic use of everyday objects and not a criticism of them as consumer objects: “I dislike labels in general and &#x27;Pop&#x27; in particular, especially because it overemphasizes the material used. There does seem to be a tendency to use similar materials and images, but the different ways they are used denies any kind of group intention”.

That year, Wesselmann had begun working on a new series of still lifes. experimenting with assemblage as well as collage. In &quot;Still Life #28&quot; he included a television set that was turned on, &quot;interested in the competitive demands that a TV, with moving images and giving off light and sound, can make on painted portions&quot;. He concentrated on the juxtapositions of different elements and depictions, which were at the time truly exciting for him: &quot;Not just the differences between what they were, but the aura each had with it ... A painted pack of cigarettes next to a painted apple wasn’t enough for me. They are both the same kind of thing. But if one is from a cigarette ad and the other a painted apple, they are two different realities and they trade on each other ... This kind of relationship helps establish a momentum throughout the picture ... At first glance, my pictures seem well behaved, as if – that is a still life, O.K. But these things have such crazy give-and-take that I feel they get really very wild&quot;. He married Claire Selley in November 1963.

In 1964 Ben Birillo, an artist and business partner of gallery owner Paul Bianchini, contacted Wesselmann and other Pop artists with the goal of organizing &quot;The American Supermarket&quot; at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. This was an installation of a large supermarket where Pop works (Warhol&#x27;s Campbell&#x27;s Soup, Watts&#x27;s colored wax eggs etc.) were shown among real food and neon signs. In the same year Wesselmann began working on landscapes, including one that includes the noise of a Volkswagen starting up. The first shaped canvas nudes also appeared this year.

===1965–1970===
Wesselmann&#x27;s works in these years: &quot;Great American Nude #53&quot;, &quot;Great American Nude #57&quot;, show an accentuated, more explicit sensuality, as though celebrating the rediscovered sexual fulfilment of his new relationship. He carried on working on his landscapes, but also made the &quot;Great American Nude #82&quot;, reworking the nude in a third dimension not defined by drawn lines but by medium: molded Plexiglas modeled on the female figure, then painted. His compositional focus also became more daring, narrowing down to isolate a single detail: the &quot;Mouth&quot; series began in 1965, his &quot;Seascapes&quot; began the following year. Two other new subjects also appeared: &quot;Bedroom Painting&quot; and &quot;Smoker Study&quot;, the latter of which developed from observation of his model for the &quot;Mouth&quot; series. The &quot;Smoker Study&quot; series of works would become one of the most recurrent themes in the 1970s.

Beginning in 1965, Wesselmann made several studies for seascapes in oil while vacationing on Cape Cod and in upstate New York. In his New York City studio, he used an old projector to enlarge them into large-format works. These views, called the &quot;Drop-Out series&quot; were constructed from the negative space around a breast. The breast and torso frame one side of the image while the arm and the leg form the other two sides. This series of works would become one of the most recurrent themes in the 1970s. He started working on shaped canvases and opted for increasingly large formats.

He worked constantly on the &quot;Bedroom Painting&quot; series, in which elements of the Great American Nude, Still Lifes and Seascapes were juxtaposed. With these works Wesselmann began to concentrate on a few details of the figure such as hands, feet, and breasts, surrounded by flowers and objects. The Bedroom Paintings shifted the focus and scale of the attendant objects around a nude; these objects are small in relation to the nude, but become major, even dominant elements when the central element is a body part. The breast of a woman concealed behind a wall appeared in a box among Wesselmann&#x27;s sculpted still life elements in a piece entitled &quot;Bedroom Tit Box&quot;, a key work that “...in its realness and internal scale (the scale relationships between the elements) represents the basic idea of the Bedroom Painting”.

===1970s===
Wesselmann made &quot;Still Life #59&quot;, five panels that form a large, complex dimensional, freestanding painting: here too the elements are enlarged, and part of a telephone can be seen. A nail-polish bottle is tipped up on one side, and there is a vase of roses with a crumpled handkerchief next to it, and the framed portrait of a woman, actress Mary Tyler Moore, whom Wesselmann considered as the ideal prototype girlfriend. These are works in which he made more recognizable portraits, with a less anonymous feel. In &quot;Bedroom painting #12&quot;, he inserted a self-portrait. &quot;Still Life #60&quot; appeared in 1974: the monumental outline, almost long, of the sunglasses acts as a frame for the lipstick, nail polish and jewelry; a microcosm of contemporary femininity that Wesselmann took to the level of gigantism.

His Smokers continued to change: he introduced the hand, with polished fingernails sparkling in the smoke.
In 1973 he brought to an end the series devoted to the Great American Nude with &quot;The Great American Nude #100&quot;. But of course the incontrovertible sensuality of Wesselmann&#x27;s nudes was constantly accompanied by an ironic guiding thread that was clearly revealed in the artist&#x27;s own words: “Painting, sex, and humor are the most important things in my life.&quot;
In 1978 Wesselmann started work on a new series of Bedroom Paintings. In these works he revised the formal construction of the composition, which was now cut by a diagonal, with one entire section being taken up by a woman&#x27;s face in the very near foreground.

===1980s===

In 1980 Wesselmann published the monograph &quot;Tom Wesselmann&quot;, an autobiography written under the pseudonym Slim Stealingworth.
His second daughter, Kate, was born; previous children were Jenny and Lane.

In 1983 Wesselmann was seized by the idea of doing a drawing in steel, as if the lines on paper could be lifted off and placed on a wall. Once in place the drawings appeared to be drawn directly on the wall. This idea preceded the available technology for lasers to mechanically cut metal with the accuracy Wesselmann needed. He had to invest in the development of a system that could accomplish this, but it took another year for that to be ready.

The incorporation of negative space that had begun in the Drop-Out series was continued into a new medium and format. They started out as works in black and white, enabling him to redevelop the theme of the nude and its composition. Wesselmann took his idea further and decided to make them in color as well.
As well as colored metal nudes, in 1984 he started working on rapid landscape sketches that were then enlarged and fabricated in aluminum.

Obliged by the use of metals to experiment with various techniques, Wesselmann cut works in aluminum by hand; for steel he researched and developed the first artistic use of laser-cut metal. Computerized imaging had not yet been developed.

===1990s===
Wesselmann&#x27;s metal works continued to go through a constant metamorphosis: &quot;My Black Belt&quot; (1990), a seventies subject, acquired a new vivacity that forcefully defined space in the new medium.
The Drawing Society produced a video directed by Paul Cummings, in which Wesselmann makes a portrait of a model and a work in aluminum.

“Since 1993 I’ve basically been an abstract painter. This is what happened: in 1984 I started making steel and aluminum cut-out figures... One day I got muddled up with the remnants and I was struck by the infinite variety of abstract possibilities. That was when I understood I was going back to what I had desperately been aiming for in 1959, and I started making abstract three-dimensional images in cut metal. I was happy and free to go back to what I wanted: but this time not on De Kooning’s terms but on mine&quot;. In this new abstract format Wesselmann preferred a random approach, and made compositions in which the metal cut-outs resembled gestural brushstrokes.

His nudes on canvas of this period rework 1960s images. “[They constitute] an unexpected but highly satisfying nostalgic return to a youthful episode in the very midst of one of the most radical changes of style in Wesselmann’s career. Self-contained and complete in themselves, they seem more likely to stand alone rather than to lead to further reinterpretations of Sixties motifs. In other words they should not be taken as a sign that Wesselmann is embarking on an extended re-engagement with his classic Pop phase...”. In 1999 he made his final Smoker work, &quot;Smoker #1 (3-D)&quot;, as a relief in aluminum.

===2000–2004===

In the last ten years, Wesselmann&#x27;s health was worsened by heart disease, but his studio output remained constant.

The abstract works display firmer lines and a chromatic range that favored primary colors. Wesselmann acknowledged the influence of Mondrian by choosing titles that recall the earlier painter&#x27;s works: &quot;New York City Beauty&quot; (2001). In these years, the influence of Matisse diminished the border between Wesselmann&#x27;s figurative and abstract styles. In 1960 Wesselmann had been able to view the works of the French master in person at the MoMA&#x27;s &quot;Gouaches Découpées&quot; (Gouache Cut-outs) exhibition, and forty years later he paid homage in his &quot;Sunset Nudes&quot; series. In &quot;Sunset Nude with Matisse&quot;, 2002, he inserted Matisse&#x27;s painting &quot;La Blouse Roumaine&quot; (1939–1940). Wesselmann also derived works from Matisse&#x27;s cut-outs: &quot;Blue Nude (2000)&quot;, initiated a series of blue nude reliefs sculpted in shaped aluminum.

Following surgery for his heart condition, Tom Wesselmann died of complications on December 17, 2004. His last major paintings of the series Sunset Nudes (2003/2004) were shown after his death at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York in April 2006.

==Personal life==
In 1957 Wesselmann met Claire Selley, another Cooper Union student who was to become his friend, model, and in 1963, his wife. They had two daughters and a son.

==Legacy==
The years following Wesselmann&#x27;s death were marked by a renewed interest in his work. Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma (MACRO) exhibited a retrospective in 2005, accompanied by a comprehensive catalogue. The following year L&amp;M Arts in New York held a major exhibition of works from the 1960s. Two galleries; Maxwell Davidson and Yvon Lambert, jointly showed the Drop-Out series in New York in 2007. This coincided with the release of a new monograph on the artist, written by John Wilmerding and published by Rizzoli, &quot;Tom Wesselmann, His Voice and Vision&quot;.

Wesselmann was a self-described fan of country music, and sometimes incorporated operating radios, TVs, or other sound elements into his works. A retrospective show &quot;Tom Wesselmann und die Pop Art : pictures on the wall of your heart&quot; (2008–2009) at Städtische Galerie in Ravensburg, Germany featured music recordings of his band, courtesy of his estate.

Another show, in 2010 by Maxwell Davidson, &quot;Tom Wesselmann: Plastic Works&quot;, was the first ever survey of Wesselmann&#x27;s work in formed plastic. A lifetime retrospective of drawings, &quot;Tom Wesselmann Draws&quot;, was shown at Haunch of Venison Gallery, New York, and then traveled to The Museum of Fine Art, Fort Lauderdale, FL, at Nova Southeastern University, and The Kreeger Museum in Washington, DC. A lifetime retrospective, the first in North America, opened at The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in May, 2012, and travelled to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Cincinnati Art Museum.

<text>The subfamily Deomyinae consists of four genera of mouse-like rodents that were previously placed in the subfamilies Murinae and Dendromurinae. They are sometimes called the Acomyinae, particularly in references that antedate the discovery that the link rat, &quot;Deomys ferugineus&quot;, is part of the clade. Deomyinae is the older name and therefore has priority over Acomyinae.

Deomyines share no morphological characteristics that can be used to separate them from other muroids, though subtle aspects of the third upper molar have been suggested. This subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetic mutations. These conclusions have demonstrated good statistical support using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and DNA-DNA hybridization.

Because of the lack of physical characteristics supporting this group, it is very possible that the subfamily as it is currently recognized is subject to enlargement. Many of the genera currently placed in the Murinae or Dendromurinae have not yet been included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis.

All genera are found in Africa, suggesting the deomyines may have originated there. The spiny mice, &quot;Acomys&quot; spp., are also found in Asia.

Individuals from every genus in the subfamily have been found to possess tail osteoderms, which are rarely seen in mammals.

<text>The Southeastern Connecticut region comprises, as the name suggests, the southeastern corner of the state of Connecticut. It is sometimes referred to as New London County or by the tourist slogan &quot;Mystic and More&quot;.

Southeastern Connecticut has historically been an area heavily dependent on traditional New England economic activities such as fishing, whaling, oystering, and the defense industry. In the present day, the area remains the primary home of the state&#x27;s fishing and shellfish activity but has since diversified its economic base to include tourism, gambling, and other services.

The area is home to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, a United States Navy base in Groton (also home to Electric Boat where the first U.S. nuclear submarine, , was launched, on January 21, 1954), a Pfizer research facility, and the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos.

==Definitions==
There are several official definitions for the region. In all definitions, the following 20 towns are always included:
*Bozrah
*Colchester
*East Lyme
*Franklin
*Griswold
*Groton (town and separate central city)
*Jewett City
*Lebanon
*Ledyard
*Lisbon
*Montville
*New London (central city)
*North Stonington
*Norwich (central city)
*Preston
*Salem
*Sprague
*Stonington (town and separate borough)
*Voluntown
*Waterford
*Windham

===Southeastern Connecticut===

This is an official region administered by the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments. It consists of 18 towns and oversees land use and transportation infrastructure planning for its member towns. 

===Southeast Service Delivery Area===
This definition adds the towns of Lyme, Old Lyme, and Voluntown to the 16 core towns listed above for a total of 19 towns.

===New England City and Town Area===
The &quot;Norwich-New London-Westerly NECTA&quot; is the metropolitan area surrounding the Norwich/New London urbanized area using towns as building blocks. This definition contains 22 towns and adds the towns of Canterbury, Lyme, Old Lyme, Voluntown, as well as the towns of Westerly and Hopkinton in Rhode Island (the latter of which now became part of the Providence–Fall River–Warwick, RI-MA NECTA).

===Metropolitan Statistical Area===
The &quot;Norwich-New London MSA&quot; is a metropolitan area definition using counties as building blocks. It consists of the 21 towns of New London County and adds the towns of Lyme and Old Lyme.

===New London Labor Market Area===
This definition contains 22 towns and adds the towns of Canterbury, Old Lyme, Old Saybrook, and Plainfield, as well as two towns in Rhode Island: Hopkinton and Westerly.

==Ethnicity==
Southeastern Connecticut&#x27;s largest ethnic group is composed of Irish-Americans, followed by Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, and colonial British descent Americans historically referenced as “Swamp Yankees.” There is also a large Latino population mainly from Puerto Rico, followed by the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Ecuador. There is an African-American presence in many municipalities, and many Asian communities in different parts of the region. The Pequot and Mohegan tribes both have their own reservations and casinos, along with a strong identity to their culture, though most tribal members only have partial Native American ancestry. Southeastern Connecticut is an ethnically diverse region.

<doc id="1310798" wikidata="Q1749609" url="?curid=1310798" title="Oxaprozin">
<text>Oxaprozin, also known as oxaprozinum, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Chemically, it is a propionic acid derivative. Safety and efficacy has been established in children over 6 years with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis only, and there is an increased risk of adverse reactions in the elderly population.
It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1983.

==Medical uses==
In 2015, oxaprozin was one of twenty NSAIDs included in a clinical trial to compare the efficacy of NSAIDs in the short-term treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The NSAIDs were compared by completing randomized controlled trials of NSAIDs in patients with active AS. Efficacy reported at 2–12 weeks and adverse effects were examined. Efficacy was measured by change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness. A total of 26 trials with a total of 3410 participants were completed (58% of the trials had fewer than 50 participants). While all 20 NSAIDs were found to reduce more pain than the placebo, 15 were found to be significantly better. In regards to the decrease of morning stiffness and the likelihood of adverse events, there was no significant difference between NSAIDs. It was concluded that etoricoxib was more effective in reducing pain of AS, however due to small studies and insufficient evidence, no one NSAID could be determined to be the most effective treatment of AS. After etoricoxib, patients taking oxaprozin experienced the least amount of pain with fewer adverse effects than naproxen.

== Adverse effects ==
In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

== History ==
Oxaprozin was developed and patented by Wyeth-Ayerst. The US patent 3578671, Oxazoles, was filed November 6, 1967 and published May 11, 1971. Following the filing of the patent, the first description of oxaprozin exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties was outlined in the article &quot;Diaryloxazole and diaylthiazolealkanoci acids: two novel series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.&quot; This article was published in Nature in 1968. In December 1988, Wyeth-Ayerst licensed the marketing rights for the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean to Searle.

Daypro became available January 5, 1993. Upon its release, “The Pink Sheet” estimated that the average whole sale price of Searle&#x27;s Daypro was $112.30 for 100 (600 mg) tablets. The price was comparable to other prescription NSAIDs.

== Society and culture ==

=== FDA approval ===
The oxaprozin new drug application (NDA 18-841) was submitted to the FDA on August 10, 1982. The drug was granted an “NDA Day” review on June 15–16, 1992. After Searle agreed to complete seven Phase IV postmarketing studies on October 22, the FDA approved Daypro on October 29, 1992.

<text>Warren Steen (July 22, 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba – August 19, 2009) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1975 to 1986, as a Progressive Conservative.

==Biography==
The son of Manley Steen, he was educated at the University of Winnipeg. Steen was executive assistant for Manitoba Minister of Agriculture George Hutton from 1962 to 1963. He served as an alderman in the old city of Winnipeg from 1970 to 1971, and as a Councillor in the amalgamated city from 1971 to 1975.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a 1975 by-election in the central Winnipeg riding of Crescentwood, defeating Liberal leader Charles Huband by 169 votes (the former MLA, New Democrat Harvey Patterson, finished third). Two years later, in the general election of 1977, he retained the seat against New Democrat Muriel Smith by 72 votes, with Huband dropping to third place. The Progressive Conservatives won this election, although Premier Sterling Lyon did not invite Steen to join his cabinet.

The NDP defeated the PC government in the 1981 election, although ironically Steen was re-elected in the riding of River Heights by an increased majority. He retained his seat until the 1986 provincial election, when Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs defeated him (this was the only seat won by the Liberal Party in this election). After his defeat in 1986, Steen did not seek to return to provincial politics, spending the rest of his working life in the insurance industry as a life underwriter.

He died at the St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg at the age of 69.

His brother Robert was also a Manitoba MLA and served as mayor of Winnipeg. He also had a second brother, Daryl. He married Margaret Jean &quot;Peggy&quot; Hunter in 1966; they had a daughter named Laura.

<text>James Deetz (February 8, 1930 – November 25, 2000) was an American anthropologist, often known as one of the fathers of historical archaeology. His work focused on culture change and the cultural aspects inherent in the historic and archaeological record, and was concerned primarily with the Massachusetts and Virginia colonies. James Deetz was interested in obtaining valuable information that could be used to better understand the lives of early North American colonists, natives, and African Americans. He investigated a variety of material culture related to these groups to better comprehend their social behavior.

In 1997 Deetz received the J. C. Harrington Award, presented by the Society for Historical Archaeology for his life-time contributions to archaeology centered on scholarship.

==Biography==
Deetz was born in Cumberland, Maryland, coal country, and was the first in his family to finish high school, much less follow with three Harvard degrees on a full scholarship. He felt a particular affinity for author John Updike and regretted that their times at Harvard did not overlap.

Deetz received his BA, MA, and PhD degrees from Harvard. Following college, Deetz enlisted in the United States Air Force. He served for four years before he was honorably discharged in 1955.

In 1957, he began working on the River Basin Survey site in Missouri. This work inspired him to get his PhD dissertation in &quot;An Archaeological Approach to Kinship Change in Eighteenth Century Arikara Culture.&quot; Deetz then became an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of California. He also taught at University of California, Santa Barbara, Harvard, Brown, William and Mary, the University of Cape Town, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Virginia. While teaching at the University of California, Deetz teamed up with J. O. Brew and Harry Hornblower to excavate sites related to North American colonial archaeology. He would later meet Henry Glassie who was his inspiration to write &quot;In Small Things Forgotten: The Archaeology of Early American Life&quot;, which was published in 1977.

By the time he was an established scholar, he was active in evaluating grant applications for the National Endowment for the Sciences and was particularly fond of having approved the construction of a 19th-century settlement village proposed to be burned to the ground so that the patterns of nail distribution could be studied to allow more accurate reconstruction of archaeological sites.

Deetz was appointed assistant director at Plimoth Plantation in 1959, and implemented changes to the way the heritage site was run. He removed everything which would not have been in the settlement in 1637, such as interpretative signs, and introduced first-person interpretation by costumed staff: &quot;part of a simulation of life in which all senses are involved, feeling, thinking, and acting in an environment as close to reality as research could make it&quot;. Deetz and his wife, Jody Deetz, brought up their nine children whilst he was working at the site. Deetz worked at Plimoth Plantation until 1978, when he took up a position at University of California, Berkeley.

==Contributions==
Deetz emphasized the importance of analyzing the physical artifacts themselves, rather than just interpreting them from archaeological reports. Deetz wrote more than 60 articles and books, influencing the style of how authors in the field of archaeology write. One of Deetz&#x27;s most famous works, &quot;In Small Things Forgotten&quot;, he used a simple yet sophisticated writing style which incorporated detailed examples of his research, including the methods and theories of his works. This book is still used in introductory archaeology classrooms today because of its ability to be understood at a basic level.

Deetz was one of the first archaeologists to foresee the influence that technology could have on the evolution of archaeology. While working on a site in Massachusetts in 1959, Deetz was able to tie in technology into the archaeological profession. He wrote a program that was used in an IBM mainframe computer, which was able to sort rim sherds based on specific characteristics of each individual piece. The program successfully differentiated and sorted the different sherds. The success of his program illustrated how archaeology can be more accurate by eliminating the human bias from rim sherd sorting. Programming today is now a much more efficient and accurate process than from the past, meaning archaeologists now routinely use its power in their work. Jim Deetz was able to influence the use of technology in the field of archaeology, making the profession much more accurate.

<text>Greater Hartford is a region located in the U.S. state of Connecticut, centered on the state&#x27;s capital of Hartford. It represents the only combined statistical area in Connecticut defined by a city within the state, being bordered by the Greater Boston region to the northeast and New York metropolitan area to the south and west. Sitting at the southern end of the Metacomet Ridge, its geology is characterized by land of a level grade along the shores of Connecticut River Valley, with loamy, finer-grained soil than other regions in the state. 
Greater Hartford (the metropolitan area as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), had a total population of 1,213,531 at the 2020 United States census.

Hartford&#x27;s role as a focal point for the American insurance industry is known nationally. The metropolitan area&#x27;s affluence and its vibrant music and arts scene define the region&#x27;s culture. The region&#x27;s economy is closely tied with Springfield, Massachusetts, with both cities being served by Bradley International Airport and with their shared presence within the Knowledge Corridor, being only 25 miles apart. The area is also served by the smaller Hartford-Brainard Airport.

==Definitions==
===New England City and Town Area===

<text>Fandi bin Ahmad (born 29 May 1962) is a Singaporean professional football manager/head coach and former player. He is currently coaching Malaysia Super League club Sri Pahang. During his professional career, he played mainly as a striker, but also occasionally as a midfielder. Along with the Singapore FA, he also played for Malaysia Cup state sides Kuala Lumpur FA and Pahang FA, and won titles with all three, including two doubles in 1992 and 1994, as well as the Golden Boot in 1988. Fandi also played for Indonesia&#x27;s Niac Mitra, Netherlands&#x27; Groningen as well as local Singaporean clubs Geylang United and SAFFC.

Internationally with the Singapore national team, Fandi earned 101 caps and scored 55 goals, a record he holds today, as well as winning three Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) silver medals while being captain from 1993 to 1997. After his retirement, he began his managerial career in 2000 by helming his former playing club SAFFC, before moving on to Indonesia&#x27;s Pelita Raya and Malaysia&#x27;s Johor Darul Takzim, while also serving as the assistant national coach on numerous occasions while and running his own Fandi Ahmad Academy.

Fandi has been described as a national legend for Singapore. In 1994, he was awarded the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) for his achievements, which included being the first Singaporean footballer to play in Europe, the first Singaporean millionaire sportsperson and the first Singaporean sportsperson to have a published biography. He has five children with his wife, South African model Wendy Jacobs, and his father is Ahmad Wartam, a former national goalkeeper. Fandi was ranked sixth in a list of &quot;Singapore&#x27;s 50 Greatest Athletes of the Century&quot; by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in 1999. His children, most notably Ikhsan, Ilhan and Irfan, are also professional footballers.

==Coaching statistics==

==Early life==
As a young child, Fandi was obsessed with football and spent much of his time kicking a ball. His family lived in a two-room public housing flat in Hougang. His family was working class; Fandi had to sell nasi lemak to help support the family. Fandi&#x27;s father, Ahmad Wartam was then a goalkeeper for the national team in the 1960s. Fandi started playing as a goalkeeper, but switched to a midfield position under the advice of his teacher when he studied at Yio Chu Kang Primary

When he was 12, his parents divorced, after which he lived in a kampong at Jalan Eunos with his father and paternal grandparents. At Serangoon Gardens Secondary School, Fandi played for the school football team, but neglected his studies and was held back a year. He then transferred to the Singapore Vocational Institute and obtained a National Trade Certificate 3. He played for Kaki Bukit SC in the amateur National Football League, where he was spotted by Singapore FA coach Sebastian Yap.

By the time he was 15, Fandi had become a regular for the Singapore national youth football team. In 1977, Fandi was vice-captain of the Singapore Under-17 national team that won the Lion City Cup youth tournament. In 1978, he became captain of the team which retained the Lion City Cup. In August that year, Fandi was called up for a senior national team squad for a training tour in Russia, becoming the youngest footballer to represent Singapore.

==Club career==
=== Singapore FA ===
Fandi joined Singapore FA in 1979 and became a regular midfield player, scoring four goals in his first Malaysia Cup season. The retirement of Arshad Khamis and Dollah Kassim prompted Jita Singh, the new Singapore FA coach, to play Fandi as a striker. During the 1980 Malaysia Cup season, Fandi scored eight goals, including the winning goal in the final against Selangor FA. He enlisted for National Service in September 1980 and was given light duties, such as collecting the camp garbage, so he could continue playing for Singapore FA. In 1981, Fandi won the FAS Footballer of the Year award for helping Singapore FA reach the Malaysia Cup final. The following year, Singapore FA did not play in the Malaysia Cup for political reasons, and Fandi underwent a shoulder operation; he could not play football for six weeks and was discharged early from National Service.

Playing against Diego Maradona

Selangor FA invited Fandi to play for them against Argentine club Boca Juniors, which featured Diego Maradona, in a friendly game, in which Fandi scored the only goal for Selangor FA; the score was 2–1. Fandi was just 19 while serving national service at the time and after the match, Boca&#x27;s chief coach Vladislao Cap said he was keen on signing the Singaporean, whom he described as &quot;a superb striker who can fit into any team&quot;.

Offers from Europe and final decision

Fandi received offers from several Malaysia Cup teams, Indonesian side Niac Mitra, Swiss club Young Boys and Dutch side Ajax. It was Ajax he eventually chose, but after a three-week trial, Fandi rejected Ajax&#x27;s three-year deal and with it, the opportunity to work with and be honed by the legendary Johan Cruyff and play up front with the likes of a young Marco van Basten and Jan Molby, whom he had been scouted along with but Fandi ended up signing a one-year contract with Niac Mitra instead earning S$75,000 annually, choosing to ply his trade nearer to home. Fandi is joined with compatriot, David Lee in Niac Mitra. Fandi helped them successfully defend their Galatama League title and was the third-highest scorer with 13 goals. In a friendly match between Niac Mitra and Arsenal, Fandi scored a goal in a 2–0 victory; however, he left Niac Mitra due to a sudden Galatama League ban on foreign players.

=== Groningen ===
In 1983, Fandi moved to the Netherlands and signed a two-year contract with Groningen. A thigh injury acquired in a friendly match kept him off the field for ten weeks, but in his first Eredivisie game he scored twice in a 2–0 victory over Go Ahead Eagles. On 19 October 1983, Fandi played in the first leg of a UEFA Cup second-round match against Italian side Internazionale, and scored the second goal in a 2–0 win with another goal came from Erwin Koeman, though in the second leg Groningen were defeated 1–5. The Inter team boasted a couple of legendary names such as Giuseppe Baresi, Giuseppe Bergomi, Alessandro Altobelli, Evaristo Beccalossi, Riccardo Ferri, Fulvio Collovati and goalkeeper, Walter Zenga. The Groningen fans voted Fandi the most popular player and the most skilful player that season; he scored 10 goals in 29 games to help the Dutch club rise from ninth to fifth place in the Eredivisie. As an April Fools&#x27; Day joke, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; published a front-page story claiming that Manchester United had signed on Fandi. His second season was marred by a recurrence of his thigh injury and a dispute with his coach. He played only two full games that season and Groningen did not offer him a new contract. During his time in the Netherlands, Fandi scored 11 league goals in 36 league games for Groningen. Fandi Ahmad teammate at Groningen who went on to become a global renowned player is Erwin Koeman, Ronald Koeman, Adri van Tiggelen, Jan van Dijk and Ron Jans.

=== Kuala Lumpur FA ===
The next club that Fandi played for was Malaysia Cup side Kuala Lumpur FA, which in 1987 won its first Malaysia Cup title.

=== OFI Crete ===
Fandi signed a two-year contract with Greek club OFI Crete in 1990. However, problems with his International Transfer Certificate prevented him from playing for Crete, so he left Greece after two months.

=== Pahang FA ===
Fandi then joined Pahang FA, where he reverted to playing mainly in midfield due to his advancing age. Fandi missed several months of games because of heel and thigh injuries, and scored three goals to help Pahang FA win the Malaysia Cup and Malaysian League Double in 1992. That year, he became the first Singaporean sportsperson to have career earnings exceeding a million Singapore dollars (not adjusted for inflation).

=== Return home to Singapore ===
Fandi rejoined Singapore FA after it was relegated to the second tier of the Malaysian League. Singapore FA was promoted and reached the Malaysia Cup final in 1993, and finished the 1994 season as Malaysia Cup and Malaysian League champions. Captain Fandi played in 39 of Singapore FA&#x27;s 41 games in the double-winning season, was the top scorer with 26 goals and was voted Player of the Season; he was also awarded a state medal, the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal). The following season, Singapore FA withdrew from the Malaysia Cup and a fully professional Singaporean league, the S.League, was formed.

=== Geylang United ===
In its inaugural S.League season in 1996, Fandi joins and captained Geylang United where he was the joint top scorer with 11 goals, including the equaliser that confirmed Geylang as league champions. The Asian Football Confederation declared him the Player of the Month of June 1996. Geylang was given special dispensation to pay Fandi thrice the S.League salary cap.

=== Singapore Armed Forces ===

Because of injuries, Fandi was limited to mainly short substitute appearances, but he continued to score crucial goals, notably two against Cambodian side Royal Dolphins in the Asian Club Championship, until his retirement in 1999.

==International career==
From 1979 to 1997, Fandi made 101 appearances for the Singapore national football team, scored 55 goals and earned a place in the Asian Football Confederation Hall of Fame. He started as captain of the national youth team that won the Lion City Cup in 1976 and 1977, then joined the senior national team on a tour of Russia, where he played in two friendly games and scored two goals in the second. His first senior cap came at 17 years, 3 months and 23 days, making him Singapore&#x27;s youngest-ever full international, until his record was broken by Hariss Harun in 2007. However, in his first international competition, the 1979 SEA Games, Fandi did not score in four matches. He scored against India and North Korea in the Olympic Games qualifiers, but did not score in three FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. In the 1981 Ovaltine Cup, Fandi scored all Singapore goals in the 3–2 aggregate victory over Malaysia. Fandi scored a goal in a 1–2 loss to Thailand in the 1981 King&#x27;s Cup and a hat-trick against the Philippines at the 1981 SEA Games.

This completed the hat-trick of silver medals, though in 2007, he said that &quot;not winning the SEA Games gold medal&quot; was among &quot;his biggest regrets&quot;. Fandi also played at the 1990 Asian Games and scored in the 6–1 win against Pakistan.

During the 1991 SEA Games, Fandi scored both Singapore goals against Myanmar in the group stage, but was substituted in the semi-final match, after Indonesian fullback Herry Setyawan elbowed him in the eye. That match ended goalless and the Lions lost on penalties. Fandi also missed Singapore&#x27;s failed attempt to qualify for the 1992 Asian Cup, having sustained a heel injury. At the 1993 SEA Games, captain Fandi scored a hat-trick in the 7–0 defeat of the Philippines, followed by the second Singapore goal in the 3–3 semi-final draw with Myanmar and scored once in the 3–1 win over Indonesia that secured a bronze medal for Singapore. Fandi also played in the inaugural Tiger Cup, and scored an equaliser against Malaysia, a goal against Brunei and two against the Philippines. 1997 was a disappointing year for Fandi, who failed to score in the Dunhill Cup and the World Cup qualifiers. After the 1997 SEA Games, where his goal in the semi-final could not prevent a 1–2 defeat to Indonesia, Fandi retired from international football.

<text>The Bishopric of Dorpat was a medieval prince-bishopric, i.e. both a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church and a temporal principality ruled by the bishop of the diocese. It existed from 1211 until 1558, generally encompassing the area that now comprises Tartu County, Põlva County, Võru County, and Jõgeva County in Estonia. The prince-bishopric was a sovereign member of the Holy Roman Empire (formally from 6 Nov 1225) and part of the Livonian Confederation until its dissolution in 1561.

The state was originally established as the Bishopric of Leal in 1211, based in Leal, modern Lihula. When the Sword Brothers in 1224 captured Yuryev (modern Tartu), they renamed it &quot;Dorpat&quot;. Prince-bishop Hermann Buxhövden of Leal took up residence there and ordered the construction of the Dorpat Cathedral. Around 1235, the bishopric was finally renamed from &quot;Leal&quot; to &quot;Dorpat&quot;.

== History ==

The first Bishop of Dorpat (the current Tartu) was Hermann von Buxhövden, the brother of Albert von Buxhövden, Bishop of Riga and leader of the Livonian Crusade. The Estonian Diocese was established by the Bishop of Riga in 1211 and its first nominal seat was Leal (Lihula) in western Estonia. In 1224, Bishop Hermann took possession of parts of what is today southeastern Estonia and chose Dorpat as his new seat. On 6 November 1225 he was enfeoffed with his principality by Henry VII of Germany, King of the Romans, and on 1 December Dorpat was created a March of the Holy Roman Empire. The principality was founded mainly on territories of the Ugaunian tribe of ancient Estonians. In 1242, Bishop Hermann with his Ugaunian subjects was defeated by Novgorod&#x27;s prince Alexander Nevsky in the famous Battle on Lake Peipus.

During 1268, Fredrik, the then Bishop of Dorpat, is known to have called himself also as the &quot;Bishop of Karelia&quot;, the background of the short-lived title remaining open.

The Bishopric of Dorpat was an important Hanseatic trade center.

At the end of the 14th century, former Dietrich Damerow became the Bishop of Dorpat. He was the archenemy of the Livonian Order and made a coalition against it with Lithuania, Mecklenburg, and the Victual Brothers (notorious pirates of the Baltic Sea). He even asked King Richard II of England to take Dorpat under his protection. The Order invaded the bishopric in 1379 with no success. After settling the conflict the Livonian Order lost its right to demand that vassals of bishoprics take part in military campaigns.

During its last years, the Bishopric of Dorpat had a dispute with Russia which became later the main pretext of the Livonian War. Tsar Ivan the Terrible demanded that the bishopric pay a huge tribute of 40,000 talers. Ivan insisted that the Dorpat was the ancient Russian fortress of &quot;Yuryev&quot; (referring to the short-lived Rus&#x27; rule of the area after its conquest by Yaroslav I the Wise, 1030–61(?)). The rulers of Dorpat tried to negotiate a smaller amount in the interest of extending the truce, but Ivan dismissed the diplomats and started the war. In 1558 Tartu was conquered by Russian troops and the Bishopric of Dorpat ceased to exist.

Beside Dorpat (Tartu) there were five more stone castles in the Bishopric:
* Odenpäh () as the ancient centre of Ugandi and the first stone stronghold of bishopric;
* Kirrumpäh (&quot;Kirumpää&quot;) and Neuhausen (&quot;Vastseliina&quot;) by the important ancient Dorpat–Pleskau (Tartu–Pihkva) road;
* Oldentorn (Vana-Kastre) and Warbeke or Caster (Uue-Kastre) by the Emajõgi river which runs from Dorpat to Lake Peipus.

There was also an outstanding Cistercian monastery, Kärkna Abbey (also Valkena or Falkenau) near Dorpat.

== The former Bishopric today ==
The center of the bishopric was the Tartu (Dorpat) castle (). The castle was damaged during the Northern War and was dismantled during the 18th century. Later (at the beginning of 19th century) an observatory was built on the site. The seat of the bishopric, Dorpat Cathedral, was damaged during the Protestant Reformation and has been in ruins since the 17th century.

<doc id="1310813" wikidata="Q1425126" url="?curid=1310813" title="Acetabularia">
<text>Acetabularia is a genus of green algae in the family Polyphysaceae. Typically found in subtropical waters, &quot;Acetabularia&quot; is a single-celled organism, but gigantic in size and complex in form, making it an excellent model organism for studying cell biology. In form, the mature &quot;Acetabularia&quot; resembles the round leaves of a nasturtium, is tall and has three anatomical parts: a bottom rhizoid that resembles a set of short roots; a long stalk in the middle; and a top umbrella of branches that may fuse into a cap. Unlike other giant unicellular organisms, which are multinucleate, members of this genus possess a single nucleus located in the rhizoid, which allows the cell to regenerate completely if its cap is removed. The caps of two &quot;Acetabularia&quot; may also be exchanged, even from two different species. In addition, if a piece of the stem is removed, with no access to the nucleus in the rhizoid, this isolated stem piece will also grow a new cap.
In the 1930s–1950s Joachim Hämmerling conducted experiments in which he demonstrated &quot;Acetabularia&quot;″s genetic information is contained in the nucleus. This was the first demonstration that genes are encoded by DNA in eukaryotes; earlier studies by Oswald Avery and others had shown that this was true for prokaryotes.

==Etymology==
The name, &quot;Acetabularia&quot;, derives from the Latin word &quot;acetabulum&quot;, a broad, shallow cup used for dipping bread; the upturned cap of &quot;Acetabularia&quot; resembles such a cup. For this reason, it is also sometimes called mermaid&#x27;s wineglass.

In the 19th century, the same designation &quot;Acetabularia&quot; was proposed by George Edward Massee for a genus of fungi (now &quot;Cyphellopus&quot;), but this usage is obsolete and considered invalid as the algal name takes precedence.

==Anatomy and life cycle==

&quot;Acetabularia&quot;, as well as being unicellular, is also a uninucleate organism. It has three basic parts: its rhizoid, a short set of root-like appendages that contain the nucleus and anchor the cell to fissures in a substrate; its median stalk, which accounts for most of its length; and its apex, where its cap forms. There are usually several whorls of hair-like appendages close to the apex.

&quot;Acetabularia&quot; are among the largest single-celled organisms, having also a remarkably large nucleus. During sexual reproduction, the nucleus undergoes multiple rounds of mitosis, forming many daughter nuclei all within one nuclear membrane. These nuclei undergo meiosis and are transported to the tips of the branches, the sporangia, where they are released as gametes.

==Hämmerling&#x27;s experiment==
Each &quot;Acetabularia&quot; cell is composed of three segments: the &quot;foot&quot; or basal segment which contains the nucleus, the &quot;stalk&quot;, and the &quot;cap&quot;. Hämmerling exchanged caps between individuals from two species, &quot;A. mediterranea&quot; and &quot;A. crenulata&quot;. &quot;A. mediterranea&quot; has a smooth, disc-shaped cap, while &quot;A. crenulata&quot; has a branched, flower-like cap.

After the exchange, each transplanted cap gradually changed from its original form to the form typical for the species of the base it was now attached to. This showed that the nucleus controlled the form of the cap.

In another experiment, Hämmerling inserted a nucleus from one species of &quot;Acetabularia&quot; into an intact &quot;Acetabularia&quot; of a different species. The &quot;Acetabularia&quot; then produced a hybrid cap with characteristics of both species. This showed that both nuclei influenced the form of the cap.
Hammerling&#x27;s results showed that the nucleus of a cell contains the genetic information that directs cellular development.

==Morphogenesis==
Although a single cell, &quot;Acetabularia&quot; exhibits a remarkably complex shape and has therefore long been a model organism for studying gene expression and morphogenesis. It seems to transport messenger RNA molecules (in an inactive riboprotein form) from the nucleus to its apical tips, where they are translated into proteins. These molecules may be activated by proteolysis of their protein carrier molecules, but this has not been verified as yet.

==Internal chemical gradients==
In addition to its gradient in specific mRNA molecules, &quot;Acetabularia&quot; exhibits concentration gradients in several types of molecules, such as ascorbic acid.

==Circadian rhythms==
&quot;Acetabularia&quot; has been used to study circadian rhythms. Studies have shown Acetabularia has a diurnal circadian rhythm. These rhythmic changes in respiratory and photosynthetic activity are maintained under constant conditions, even with the removal of the nucleus, showing the regulation of the rhythm is independent of the nucleus. However, the nucleus isn&#x27;t completely uninvolved, as it is responsible for the shifting of the cycles due to external changes. In one experiment a nucleus from a specimen trained on one circadian rhythm was transplanted into a de-nucleated plant on a rhythm that differed by 12 hours, over a period of days the donated nucleus changed the circadian rhythm of the receiving organism to that of the donor organism.

==Aquarium trade==
&quot;Acetabularia&quot; species occasionally make their way into the aquarium trade. They are generally considered to be more difficult or unappealing macroalgae to care for in the reef aquarium, a fish-only, or a FOWLR (Fish Only With Live Rock) system, as they are delicate, readily eaten by herbivorous fish, grow slowly, and do not have the high nutrient uptake that reef aquarium refugium species (such as &quot;Chaetomorpha&quot; and &quot;Caulerpa&quot;) do. However, they are suitable for a macroalgae display tank, and thus macroalgae suppliers often carry species of &quot;Acetabularia&quot;.

<text>Reddam House Berkshire, formerly Bearwood House, is a co-educational, independent school in Wokingham, in the English county of Berkshire. Reddam House provides education for boys and girls aged between 3 months and 18 years. The school is set in 125 acres of wood and open parkland, and is housed in the Victorian mansion of Bearwood House. The current principal is Mr Rick Cross. The school has around 670 students and offers day places as well as weekly and termly boarding for all ages.

==History==

In 1816, John Walter II (1776–1847), owner of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, purchased the 304-acre estate known as &quot;Bear Wood&quot; from the crown estate of King George III, on which the school is now located. By 1822, John Walter had constructed a modest Georgian villa on the exact spot on which the present mansion still stands. In 1865, John Walter&#x27;s son, John Walter III (1818–1894), also owner of &quot;The Times&quot;, decided to tear down his father&#x27;s house and employed the Scottish architect Professor Robert Kerr to design and build a new house at Bearwood. Construction lasted from 1865–1874 and cost £150,000 (£17,200,000 today). The Bearwood Mansion is one of the largest Victorian country houses in England. Nikolaus Pevsner described it as &quot;the climax of country mansions, in its brazen way one of the major Victorian monuments of England&quot;. Bearwood has also been described as &quot;a Victorian monument of stone and oak&quot;, &quot;a Palace of a Prince of the Press&quot; and &quot;the Second Palace of Berkshire&quot; (after Windsor Castle).

During the Great War (1914–1918), Bearwood was occupied by Canadian soldiers who had been fighting on the Western front. In mid-1915 John Walter V, offered the mansion to the Canadian army as a convalescent hospital. In 1919, John Walter V sold the mansion to Sir Thomas Devitt and Sir Alfred Yarrow, two merchants from London. The two gifted the magnificent mansion and 100 acres of surrounding woods and parkland to the Royal Merchant Navy School.

The Royal Merchant Navy School was established in 1827 in the City of London. Originally called The Merchant Seamans&#x27; Orphan Asylum, the purpose of the orphanage was to clothe, care for and to educate children whose fathers were lost at sea. In 1861, the orphanage moved to Snaresbrook where Prince Albert, the Prince Consort laid the foundation stone for the new orphanage. This would be the last public ceremony of its kind performed by Prince Albert before his untimely death just six months later, on 14 December 1861. In 1902, the orphanage was given the title of &quot;Royal&quot; by King Edward VII, and so was renamed the Royal Merchant Seaman&#x27;s Orphanage. In 1922, King George V ordered that the word &quot;orphanage&quot; be dropped from the name of the organisation, and so it was renamed The Royal Merchant Navy School. In 1921, the school moved to Sindlesham near Wokingham, Berkshire into the Victorian mansion, Bearwood House.

In 1961, the Royal Merchant Navy School became an all-boys school. In 1965/66 the school changed its name to Bearwood College. In 1991, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the Bearwood Theatre as Patron of the college, and in 1995 the school became co-educational again. 
Bearwood College faced a period of uncertainty as a protracted legal proceedings threatened its future on the site which was resolved in 2010 at the High Court, London.
Declining student numbers and the cost of maintaining the mansion, boarding houses, school buildings and the estate led to the closure of the college in June 2014.

The school and mansion were subsequently bought by the Reddam House group in 2014, and in 2015 Reddam House Berkshire was established on the site. Reddam House, Berkshire is part of the international portfolio of 27 schools run by the Reddam House group. Reddam House Berkshire has maintained informal links with the Royal Merchant Navy School and Bearwood College alumni association since its creation in 2014 and has invited Old Royals members to various events and services held throughout the school year within the Victorian mansion house and chapel.

==Facilities==
On-site facilities at Reddam House Berkshire include a chapel, 350-seat theatre with conference facilities, 25m indoor swimming pool, gymnasium, 4G Astro turf hockey pitch, 5 netball courts and 4 tennis courts as well as multiple pitches for cricket, football and rugby. There is also the facility to hold sailing, archery, paintballing and climbing within the school grounds.

The theatre was built in 1991 as part of Bearwood College and opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It was refurbished in 2014/2015 by Reddam House Berkshire upon their purchase of the site, and is used by the school and local and community groups, including the annual Opera at Bearwood.

== Reddam House Group of Schools ==

Reddam House Group was established in 2000 in Cape Town, South Africa. Reddam House group is part of Inspired Educational Group which provides financial backing, logistical support, and professional oversight for its schools and educators.

<doc id="1310819" wikidata="Q4872828" url="?curid=1310819" title="Battle of the Ancre">
<text>The Battle of the Ancre was fought by the British Fifth Army (Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough), against the German 1st Army (General Fritz von Below). The Reserve Army had been renamed the Fifth Army on 30 October. The battle was the last of the big British attacks of the Battle of the Somme. After the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September) the Anglo-French armies tried to press their advantage with smaller attacks in quick succession, rather than pausing to regroup and give the Germans time to recover. Subsequent writers gave discrete dates for the Anglo-French battles but there were considerable overlaps and continuities of operations until the weather and supply difficulties in mid-November ended the battle until the new-year.

The British attack was to fulfil complementary objectives. Political discontent in London would be muted by a big victory, as would doubts of British commitment by its allies and British loyalty to the Chantilly strategy of 1915 would be upheld. The capture of Beaumont Hamel and Serre would go some way to redeem the failure of 1 July and obtain ground on which the British would have a tactical advantage. The attack was the largest in the British sector since September and had a seven-day preliminary bombardment, which was twice as heavy as that of 1 July. The capture of Beaumont Hamel, St Pierre Divion and Beaucourt threatened the German hold on Serre further north. Edmund Blunden called the battle &quot;a feat of arms with any recorded. The enemy was surprised and beaten&quot;. Four German divisions had to be relieved due to the number of casualties they suffered and over troops were taken prisoner.
==Background==

===Tactical developments===

After meeting on 17 October between Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Rawlinson the Fourth Army commander and Gough, General Sir Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) cancelled the Third Army operation planned in September and on 23 October, the Reserve Army attack was reduced from a converging attack towards the Ancre river, to an attack up the valley. The failure of the Fourth Army attack of 18 October, caused another revision of the plan. The Reserve Army was to capture the rest of Thiepval Ridge with II Corps on 21 October, the Fourth and French Sixth armies were to attack on 23 October and the reduced Reserve Army attack on both sides of the Ancre was to begin on 25 October. Gough issued a new operation order on 15 October and began another reorganisation on the north side of the Ancre. The II Corps operation on 21 October succeeded but the rains returned on 24 October. The main attack was postponed until 25 October and then cancelled; Gough was given discretion to continue with postponements by Haig. On 27 October, Gough set 1 November as the provisional date, postponed it again on 29 October to 5 November and on 3 November, Haig gave Gough the choice of cancelling the attack and resuming operations when the weather improved. On 5 November, Haig suggested a subsidiary attack, if the state of the ground justified the effort. Gough proposed an attack on 9 November but preferred to delay the main effort. Haig agreed that there should be no attack until the ground was dry enough for infantry to move freely and there was a forecast of two days of fair weather; another postponement followed.

On 3 November, Major-General Rudolph Cavan the XIV Corps commander, wrote to Rawlinson, objecting to the renewal of attacks on Le Transloy, having already lost Rawlinson informed Haig that he was going to limit the next attack, which led to a conference at Fourth Army headquarters on 4 November, attended by Haig and General Ferdinand Foch. Haig explained that the Fourth Army would be attacking at other points on 5 November and Cavan agreed to make certain that the French left flank was protected. On 6 November, Rawlinson announced that the Fifth Army operation due in the Ancre valley had been reduced and that the Fourth Army would conduct &quot;modified operations&quot;, intended to stop the Germans moving troops from France. Apart from attacks near Saillisel, the French Sixth Army began to consolidate for the winter. After another discussion on 8 November, at the Fifth Army headquarters by Lieutenant-General Launcelot Kiggell, Haig&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff and Gough, a meeting between Gough and the corps commanders, decided that the attack should begin on 13 November, if the weather stayed dry. Opinion among divisional and brigade commanders varied on the possibility of an attack and that it should go ahead or be cancelled rather than be postponed again; patrols were sent out frequently to report on the state of the ground. On 10 November, Gough set the attack for on 13 November. After studying the Fifth Army plans, Haig allowed the attack to go ahead and Gough later arranged with the corps commanders, that operations towards Pys and Irles would begin if the attack on 13 November went well but avoided detail, due to the uncertain weather.

==Prelude==

===British preparations===
To be ready for the big attack intended for 12 October, Gough began to concentrate more troops in the area north of the Ancre. In early October the north bank was held by the 39th Division of V Corps up to the boundary with the Third Army at Hébuterne. On 1 October, the 2nd Division was moved in on the left of the 39th Division to hold the ground from Redan Ridge to the army boundary. On 4 October the XIII Corps headquarters was brought out of reserve, to control of the front line up to the junction with the Third Army and the 2nd Division was relieved on the left by the 51st Division. The 39th Division was transferred to the command of II Corps on 2 October and then took over the area south of the Ancre on 5 October, by extending its right boundary to relieve the 18th Division at Thiepval. By 7 October XIII Corps had the 51st and 19th Divisions in line and on 8 October, V Corps relieved the 2nd Division with the 3rd and 63rd divisions. Gough issued instructions for the attack on the north bank from 4 to 12 October and arranged for the 1st and 3rd Cavalry divisions to move close to the front line. The artillery of V Corps and XIII Corps steadily bombarded the German defences on the south bank where II Corps operations against (Regina Trench to the Canadians at the east end and Stuff Trench to the British at the western end, north of Thiepval) and conducted a simulated offensive with artillery bombardments, wire-cutting and smoke screens.

The British front line north of the Ancre had been moved forward across no-man&#x27;s-land, until the average width was less than . It was intended to isolate the battlefield with artillery and bombard Pys, Irles, Miraumont and Puisieux and the main trenches leading to the battlefield. On the II Corps front, artillery fire was to simulate an attack on the ground east of the old German second line (Grandcourt line) as would XIII Corps artillery on the German approaches to the northern flank. Slow progress on the south bank by II Corps, attempting to occupy Regina Trench, caused by a serious deterioration in the weather and determined defence by the Germans of the remainder of their positions on the ridge north of Courcelette and Thiepval, caused numerous postponements of the general attack on both sides of the Ancre. Haig&#x27;s plans of late September were reduced to achieving as much as could be done in periods of better weather. Conditions on the battlefield by mid-October, were &quot;so bad as to make mere existence a severe trial of body and spirit&quot;. On 12 November, Beaumont Hamel was subjected to a gas bombardment, similar to one on 28 October, when &quot;sk&quot; (lachrymatory) mortar bombs were fired into the village at midday, to wear out the German garrison&#x27;s respirators and then in the evening Phosgene was fired by Livens Projector to kill them.

===British plan===
Gough planned to attack on 13 November, with five divisions from II and V Corps astride the Ancre river, which flowed between Thiepval and Beaumont Hamel. Gough intended to reduce the head of the German salient between Thiepval and Serre, the main effort coming from V Corps with the 63rd, 51st, 2nd and 3rd divisions, against positions north of the Ancre, which had not been seriously attacked since 1 July. It was hoped that the intervening nineteen weeks of trench warfare, had substantially reduced German fighting power. Three objective lines were set, the first running from Beaucourt Station (opposite St Pierre Divion)–up Beaumont Hamel valley–eastern outskirts of Beaumont Hamel–Redan Ridge–west of Serre, requiring an advance of over three German trench lines and four trench lines in places. The second line was further forward, running west of Beaucourt–east slope of Redan Ridge–east of Serre–west to the boundary of V and XIII Corps, which would be advanced towards Star Wood. The final objective (third line) was set at Beaucourt–the Puisieux road valley–second line. II Corps with the 4th Canadian, 18th, 19th and 39th divisions was to advance from Stuff trench and Redoubt to the line to force the Germans out of their defences, from Redoubt–St Pierre Divion, as far back as Beaucourt, securing the road bridges by Beaucourt station and Beaucourt mill by 

The V Corps bombardment was intended to create tactical surprise, by the heavy artillery firing on the German front line thirty minutes before dawn each morning, for an hour of intense fire joined by the field artillery. It was hoped that the German garrisons would become accustomed to the routine and not react, when the opening bombardment for the attack began at No man&#x27;s land back from the front trench was to be bombarded by 25 percent of the 18-pounders, to cover the infantry as it advanced from the British line. After six minutes the bombardment would creep forward at in five minutes, pausing on the reserve line of the German front trench system before moving on. The infantry had to reach the first objective and then move on after a pause of an hour. After five minutes of silence a lifting bombardment, beginning with intense fire, would signal the infantry to begin their advance. The attack by the 63rd Division on Beaucourt was to begin after zero, preceded by a bombardment from all available artillery. A few tanks were available and the bombardment was twice the weight of that before 1 July. A machine-gun barrage (first tried at the Battle of Thiepval Ridge, September) was to be laid on the German machine-guns dug in along the ridge behind Beaumont Hamel.

Air reconnaissance reports late in the afternoon of 17 November, indicated that the Germans had abandoned Puisieux Trench and the Grandcourt line south of the river. Gough ordered both corps commanders to send patrols and occupy the trenches if possible. New orders were issued, extending the objectives for the attack planned for 18 November. The new plan for 18 November allowed II Corps a halt of on the first objective and the 19th Division would then attack Grandcourt and Baillescourt Farm. The 4th Canadian and 18th divisions would then advance and take Grandcourt Trench to link with the 19th Division at the east end of Grandcourt. II Corps was then to cross the Ancre to take Baillescourt Farm. V Corps was to synchronise its advance to Pusieux Trench and River Trench up to Artillery Alley on the north bank of the Ancre. Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob the II Corps commander protested against the plan and was over-ruled, despite patrols from the 19th Division finding Germans repairing the wire of the Grandcourt line.

===German preparations===
Agents had warned the German command by 12 October, that an offensive was looming on the Ancre and in diary entries for October, the army group commander, Field Marshal Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria anticipated the British attack. On 2 November, General Fritz von Below, commander of the 1st Army, reported that he expected an attack between the Ancre and Gommecourt and that there were signs that British attacks further east were over for the year. On 21 October, Rupprecht favoured withdrawal from St Pierre Divion and Beaumont Hamel but the 1st Army commander took a tactical view, pointing out that withdrawal would forfeit observation from the high ground and that no positions behind the line were better placed. The 12th Division was brought in between the 38th Division at Beaucourt and the 52nd Division at Serre on 22 October. The French attack at Verdun on 24 October, dislocated reliefs on the Somme but British pressure forced the replacement of the seven divisions from Le Transloy to the Ancre from 24 October to 10 November, then the relief of one of the replacement divisions.

On 22 October, Below ordered that on the south side of the Ancre, was to fight for every piece of ground and where there were enough men, ground was to be recaptured and fortified. Work was ordered to build new defensive strongpoints to shelter troops in reserve and then connect them into lines, the rear of the 5th &quot;Ersatz&quot; Division to be strengthened to make a possible British attack from Miraumont to Pys a slow and costly advance. Below also ordered an unyielding defence of the German positions north of the Ancre, even in positions enfiladed from the south. After the German recapture of La Maisonette on 29 October, counter-attacks against the French at Sailly-Saillisel and elsewhere were cancelled, yet there were no reinforcements for the 12th Division in the Ancre sector. A &quot;fresh&quot; regiment of the 12th Division took over at Beaumont Hamel from despite being under strength, its companies only having ; by 10 November it had suffered another Constant shelling and wet weather exhausted the German troops and cut off the flow of supplies until 11 November, when the British shellfire eased. On 6 November, Below and Lossberg the 1st Army Chief of Staff, concluded that the Ancre–Serre salient was too dangerous to hold, due to artillery fire from the flank and rear and Below contemplated a withdrawal to Lesbœufs.

==Battle==

===Fifth Army===

====13–15 November====

The seven-day bombardment cut the wire on most of the attack front and destroyed many German defensive positions, except the dugouts built deep below the villages near the front-line. The rain stopped on the night of and a full moon illuminated the landscape. Towards dawn on 13 November, a mist developed which reduced visibility to nil. The mist helped the British advance by reducing visibility but caused many units to lose the barrage as they struggled through mud. II Corps attacked on the right with 19th Division. A battalion from the 58th Brigade made no progress against Stump Road; the 56th Brigade attacked on the right by assembling in no man&#x27;s land before Stuff Trench, with a machine-gun company attached and followed up by Engineer and Pioneer parties, ready to help consolidate captured ground. The mist helped conceal the British troops, who by had reached their objective, partly along Lucky Way, a sunken road leading into Grandcourt. No German counter-attacks were encountered.

The 39th Division attacked to the west of the 19th Division, with the 118th Brigade on its right flank. The brigade formed up on tapes laid without the German sentries noticing and one battalion advanced north about to the Hansa line by while three battalions attacked north-west to Mill Trench and then reached the station crossing and Beaucourt Mill by ; the other two battalions got lost in the fog. At the 117th Brigade attacked from Mill Road up the Ancre valley next to the river, with one battalion and achieved surprise, despite a special barrage from twelve The battalion cleared dugouts in the side of the river bank and along the top, then met some of the troops of 118th Brigade who were lost and combined to attack St Pierre Divion, which was captured around Three tanks were to advance from Thiepval to assist but one was bogged on the drive to the village, the second broke down and the third reached the German front line at then fell into a dug-out, where it was attacked by the Germans. A messenger pigeon was sent by the tank crew for help but infantry arrived at and the Germans withdrew.

In V Corps, two 63rd Division brigades advanced with all four battalions forward and with two in support from the reserve brigade. On the right, the advance met much German machine-gun fire from the start but captured the German front trenches, then advanced on time to capture Beaucourt Station and Station Road, taking by The two battalions on the left were severely depleted by machine-gun fire, as was the left brigade although about reached the first objective. On the extreme left, only isolated groups managed to advance, where they met troops from the 51st Division. The left brigade began bombing attacks and the reserve brigade was sent forward. By troops were digging in along the German reserve line in the south, while three battalions were held up along the German front line, although some of their troops appeared on the Beaumont Hamel spur. At about advanced to the edge of Beaucourt, before withdrawing slightly and digging-in under artillery fire, before gaining touch with troops from the 39th Division from across the river. The German strong point on Beaumont Hamel spur was attacked many times but little ground was gained. As night fell, the division had linked with the 51st Division on the left, in the German support trench. Reinforcements from the reserve brigade and an extra battalion reached Beaucourt and extended the position to the left as far as Beaucourt Alley by Two battalions reached the first objective by midnight and a battalion took over the British front line.
Both brigades of the 51st Division attacked the first objective (green line) at Station Road and Beaumont Hamel and then the final objective (yellow line) at Frankfort Trench with three battalions, while the fourth provided carrying parties. Six minutes before zero, the leading battalion of the right brigade moved beyond the British wire and advanced when the new mine at Hawthorn Crater was blown, passed the east end of &quot;Y Ravine&quot; and reached the first objective at with a stray party from the 63rd Division. The battalion pushed on then withdrew slightly to Station Road. On the left, fire from &quot;Y Ravine&quot; held up the advance and at another battalion reinforced the attack. Troops skirted the ravine to the north and early in the afternoon a battalion from the reserve brigade attacked Beaumont Hamel from the south, joined by troops in the vicinity. The left brigade was held up in places by uncut wire, south of Hawthorn Crater and massed machine-gun fire north of the Auchonvillers–Beaumont Hamel road. Two tanks were sent up, one bogging between the German front and support lines and the other north of the village. Consolidation began and three battalions were withdrawn to the German reserve line and reinforced at , while one battalion formed a defensive flank to the south, as the positions reached by the 63rd Division were unknown.

The 2nd Division advanced along Redan Ridge. The 5th Brigade on the right formed up in no man&#x27;s land, hugged the barrage and got into the German front line easily. Two battalions reached Beaumont Trench on schedule and the other two formed a defensive flank facing north and repelled bombing attacks from the 6th Brigade area, where the advance had been held up by fog and mud, then fire from &quot;The Quadrilateral&quot; in the middle of the 6th Brigade area, where some troops on the right managed to reach the first objective. The junction of Beaumont Trench and Lager Alley was blocked; some troops veered north-east after finding stray troops from the 3rd Division and assuming that they had lost direction. By the 5th Brigade was ready to advance on the second objective and reached Frankfort Trench so depleted, that the troops fell back to Munich trench, Wagon Road then Crater Lane in the German front line. The reserve brigade moved forward at the same time and two battalions were sent to reinforce the 5th Brigade at the first objective. At the remainder of the 6th Brigade was ordered back to the British front line to reorganise and two attacks by the reserve brigade were ordered then cancelled. Overnight the ground was consolidated and two 37th Division battalions were sent up from corps reserve next morning.

The 3rd Division attacked Serre with two brigades, the 8th Brigade on the right using all four battalions and the 76th Brigade on the left attacking with two battalions and two in support, with . Waist-deep mud caused a fiasco; some troops from the 8th Brigade reached the German support line, then fell back and some lost direction. The 76th Brigade had the same trouble and at an attempt was made to collect exhausted men scattered around in shell-holes. At all operations were cancelled.

In XIII Corps, the 31st Division was to attack with the 92nd Brigade on a front to form a defensive flank. Two battalions advanced at midnight with snipers and Lewis gunners in support. The main attack began at and the German first line was easily occupied. The advance to the support trench was contested all morning, with German bombers counter-attacking towards Star Wood. Carrying parties were held up in no man&#x27;s land by German artillery fire and at a German attack from Star Wood in the open was &quot;destroyed&quot; by British machine-gun fire from the flank. Due to the failure of the 3rd Division attack, the brigade was ordered to retire at which was carried out by 

In II Corps, the 19th Division raided Stump Road and Lucky Way and began the relief of the 39th Division by extending its front to the Ancre, which was completed in the early hours of 15 November. In V Corps the 63rd Division continued an attack on Beaucourt Trench at advancing from Station Road and losing direction in the mist. Some troops got to within of Beaucourt Trench and waited for the attack due at The 190th Brigade advanced on time, linked with the troops near the objective and entered Beaucourt, taking and digging in around the eastern outskirts. Beaucourt Trench was captured on the left and troops began to bomb down it towards Leave Avenue but no troops of the 51st Division were found. Two tanks were sent forward to help mop up German troops holding out in the front line, one bogged but the other helped take The Strongpoint, where surrendered. Dugouts towards Station Road yielded another . At German troops were seen massing near Baillescourt Farm and dispersed by artillery; the captured ground was consolidated overnight.

The 51st Division was supposed to have attacked at when the 37th Division brigade, attached to the 63rd Division advanced but the orders were late and only strong patrols could be organised in time, which were forced back by the Germans. At Munich Trench was occupied but British artillery began to bombard it at forcing the infantry out into shell-holes. A company tried to bomb down Leave Avenue with no effect and during the night the digging of New Munich Trench began, in ignorance of the German evacuation of Munich Trench. The 2nd Division attacked Munich Trench at by advancing an hour before zero but had many casualties from an inaccurate British barrage. Many troops got lost in the mist and some strayed into Leave Avenue in the 51st Division area, thinking that it was Munich Trench, where they were pinned down. Troops which did reach Munich Trench were severely depleted and confusion reigned when some German troops wanted to surrender and others refused. On the left flank, Lager Alley was crossed unrecognised, because of the bombardment and the troops extended the British hold on Serre Trench. Troops withdrew from Munich Trench later in the morning to Wagon Road where they were joined by part of a reserve battalion. On the left flank of the attack, a battalion took over the defensive flank south of the Quadrilateral–Lager Alley, which was linked to the British trench by Cat Street tunnel. Believing that Munich Trench had been captured, two battalions were ordered to attack Frankfort Trench at and were surprised by German machine-gun fire from Munich Trench; the survivors withdrew to Wagon Road.

====Air operations====
Air observation for the infantry attack which began on 13 November was not possible, because of dense white fog during the day. On the morning of 14 November the mist cleared and 4 and 15 Squadrons flew contact patrols, which revealed the capture of Beaucourt and ground to the north-west. Artillery observation flights gave the positions of batteries, many of which were silenced by counter-battery fire. German infantry were harassed from the air; troops spotted in a ravine north of Beaucourt were heavily bombarded by British heavy artillery after a &quot;zone call&quot;. Another observer directing fire from a siege battery saw approximately infantry sheltering in trenches, brought immediate artillery fire on them and then the crew strafed them. Two battalions of infantry were caught on the road near Achiet le Petit and heavily bombarded. During the night ten aircraft from 18 Squadron made low attacks on railway stations, trains and road transport with bombs and machine-guns. A German aircraft followed two of the British aircraft to their base and bombed the aerodrome, leaving craters in the landing-ground. A dummy landing-ground was illuminated as a ruse and was machine-gunned by a German aircraft later that night.

There was good flying weather from and frost which improved the going for the infantry. Artillery co-operation worked well on 16 November when area calls from aircraft led to &quot;devastating&quot; fire on trenches full of German infantry. An artillery battery was destroyed, seven gun-pits were demolished and , many of the batteries firing in the area being silenced. Contact patrols found the location of British troops easily, although one aircraft was shot down and two observers returned wounded. The railway junction at Hirson away, was bombed by 27 Squadron, attacking from , hitting coaches, wagons in sidings and two station buildings. Other squadrons raided supply dumps at Courselles and Logeast Wood. Air fighting on 16 November began when six British aircraft intercepted three German two-seaters, which had been sent to attack British artillery observation aircraft and shot them down. A new Albatros was captured and four more German aircraft were shot down by offensive patrols, which lost two aircraft. During the night bombing and machine-gun attacks resumed on German railheads, supply dumps and an airfield near Flesquières, while German night bombers raided a French airfield at Cachy and hit . On 17 November fewer combats with German aircraft occurred, three aircraft being lost and three German aircraft being shot down. On 18 November, the final day of the ground operation, a thaw set in and rain and snow reduced visibility, making it impossible for British troops to be seen, even at low level.

====15–17 November====

On 15 November, the 39th Division of II Corps completed the capture of Redoubt, which took until In V Corps, the 37th Division relieved the 63rd Division and linked with the 51st Division to the north. Bombing attacks began up Beaucourt Trench towards Munich Trench, which reached the 51st Division around Patrols to Muck and Railway trenches found them empty (except for mud). Companies of the 51st and 2nd divisions attacked at and were caught in their barrage, some troops reaching Frankfort Trench then returning to New Munich Trench. A 2nd Division attack with two battalions of the 37th Division lost direction in the mist and fell back to Wagon Road with many casualties, while a third battalion strengthened the left flank by bombing forward and building a strong point in the Quadrilateral, near the top of Redan Ridge, as two tanks in support bogged down early. After dark, the 37th Division in the V Corps area, pushed up Ancre Trench and set up posts in Bois d&#x27;Hollande and at Railway and Muck trenches. The 32nd Division, from II Corps reserve, took over from the 2nd Division on the northern defensive flank, where there was considerable confusion over the location of the front line. During the night the right linked up with the 51st Division at New Munich Trench and Leave Avenue. During 17 November, the 32nd Division extended to the right to relieve the 51st Division.

====18 November====
On 15 November, Gough was visited again by Kiggell to discuss the end of the offensive. After consultations with his subordinates, Gough asked for permission to continue for two more days, weather permitting, which was given that evening. By the morning of 16 November, Gough had heard that Munich and Frankfort Trenches were still held by the Germans and that casualties had been more severe than hoped. Attacks against Serre were abandoned and the main effort was made on 18 November by II Corps pushing down towards the south bank of the Ancre. V Corps, on the north bank, was to provide flank support by capturing Frankfort Trench, advancing along Ancre Trench and taking Bois d&#x27;Hollande. The attack was delayed until 18 November, to be certain that preparations were complete.

The first snow fell on the night of and the attack at began in sleet, which later turned to rain, visibility being nil. In II Corps the 4th Canadian Division was to attack Desire and Desire Support trenches south of Grandcourt, roughly parallel to the Ancre. On the extreme right of the attack, east of the road towards Pys the 10th Brigade attacked to form the eastern flank of the attack and was obstructed by a new German trench; on the far right the brigade was hampered by a British smoke barrage. Fire from numerous machine-guns, forced survivors from the 46th Battalion to retire. The 50th Battalion companies found little German resistance, lost touch with the 11th Brigade to the left, took and began digging in behind Desire Support Trench, before losses from flanking fire forced them to retreat to Regina Trench. The 11th Brigade attacked in &quot;blinding sleet&quot;; the 75th Battalion lost direction and veered west, crossing the Courcelette–Pys road but the brigade reached the rest of its objectives, taking most of Desire Support Trench. Patrols went forward to Grandcourt Trench, found a few Germans, then took prisoner a German detachment near Coulee Trench, being captured in all.

West of the Canadians the 18th Division attacked with the 55th Brigade, which assembled in no man&#x27;s land on the snow. By Desire Trench on the right flank next to the Canadians was captured and a gap between the two right-hand battalions was closed by converging grenade attacks. The two battalions on the left flank disappeared into a gap where the 19th Division had lost direction and veered to the left. German machine-gunners moved into the gap and annihilated two companies and seven runners sent towards the missing battalions were killed. The battalions had been badly hit by German shellfire and the Germans held on to Point 66 on the Courcelette–Grandcourt road, before bombing attacks westwards along Desire Trench until night fell, which allowed the left flanking battalion to reach part of its objective. Posts west of Point 66 were withdrawn and Point 66 was connected to Regina Trench. Next morning more patrols moved west along the trench and by last light it was found that the Germans had withdrawn from the trench as far as Stump Road.

The 19th Division attacked with two brigades. On the right the 57th Brigade advance reached German positions west of Stump road on the boundary of the 18th Division and pressed on before being cut off and taken prisoner; troops managing to escape much later on. Further west, the British lost direction in the snow, then found it again but were stopped by uncut wire on the right, with many casualties. On the left, troops got into the Grandcourt line and pushed across Battery Valley on a front of , into the south-west part of Grandcourt. The 56th Brigade advanced on the St Pierre Divion–Grandcourt road and along the railway to meet V Corps at Beaucourt. On the right, where the ground to the right of Hansa Road was firm, the attack reached the west end of Grandcourt and the attackers bombed their way to the 57th Brigade troops already there. The left battalions moved forward up the embankment (which was on the north bank of the Ancre where the advance began but was on the south bank between Beaucourt and Grandcourt) parallel to a platoon across the river at Beaucourt Mill and passed north around the west end of Grandcourt. The ground on the railway and the road at the edge of Grandcourt was consolidated by Royal Engineers. The left battalion of the division was to capture Baillescourt Farm on the north bank of the Ancre but one company was stopped by machine-gun fire from Grandcourt, as the other advanced along the railway embankment and sent out a patrol which met one from V Corps.
V Corps attacked with two divisions north of the Ancre river. The 37th Division moved on its right through Beaucourt and at about , established posts from Bois d&#x27;Hollonde west to the Puisieux road and south to Ancre Trench. At dawn both brigades held Muck Trench and were ready to advance, once the 32nd Division on the left captured Frankfort Trench. At zero hour, patrols found German troops in Railway Trench; further to the left British troops bombed their way to the junction of Leave Avenue and Frankfort Trench, where the meeting with the 32nd Division was expected. Puisieux Trench was entered with difficulty and captured down to the Ancre and a patrol met the 19th Division troops on the railway.

The 32nd Division was to attack Munich and Frankfort trenches, between Leave Avenue and Lager Alley. On the right the 97th Brigade advanced with all four battalions at , through sleet and the right-hand battalion was soon stopped by machine-gun fire. The right flank of the centre right battalion was also stopped but further left the advance reached Munich and Frankfort trenches, where the British were cut off and captured. Troops on the left were stopped at a strongpoint in Munich Trench and held on in no-man&#x27;s-land until dark. Further left the junction of Lager Alley was captured and down the hill, touch was gained with the 14th Brigade. The 14th Brigade was to capture Ten Tree Alley forward and form a defensive flank. One battalion began early, advanced down Lager Alley, with its left on Serre Trench and descended the valley towards the village which some troops reached, although most were captured or killed during the day. The next battalion on the left was quickly stopped by German machine-gun fire, after the British barrage fell too far forward and attempts to bomb forward failed, the battalions of 97th Brigade rallying in Wagon Road and New Munich Trench. German artillery fire was more effective, cutting communication apart from pigeons and runners. The only gain for the brigade was on the left flank near the &quot;Quadrilateral&quot; where a slight advance was made and consolidated. Ninety men of the 16th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry (the &quot;Glasgow Boys Brigade&quot; Pals battalion) were cut off in Frankfort Trench, where they held out until 21 November when (thirty of them wounded) surrendered.

===German 1st Army===

====13–15 November====
The night of was quiet, then near dawn a mist formed and cut visibility to nil. At a hurricane bombardment began on the German front line and a mine went off in the 1 July mine crater on Hawthorn Ridge. Around Serre, the 52nd Division began the defence of the village, which lasted for several days. Troops of the division had detected British digging in no-man&#x27;s-land despite the fog and a patrol reported the British approach. Confusion caused by the mist allowed the British to get into the first two trenches north of Serre, which were eventually recaptured. After a quiet night, the 23rd Division troops from Infantry Regiment 62 at Beaumont Hamel, stood to at dawn in the fog and were surprised by the arrival of the post, which reduced tension; sentries then reported many footfalls in no man&#x27;s land. The northern flank was devastated by the mine explosion and the front line was simultaneously deluged by shrapnel and mortar fire. The German troops followed the drill for meeting an attack, each man throwing a grenade as they lined the parapet and machine-gunners fired into no-man&#x27;s-land. The British arrived at intervals in scattered groups, many smoking cigarettes and with their rifles slung.

Signal rockets were fired for the artillery but in the fog went unseen and the rest were thrown into no-man&#x27;s-land to illuminate the British as they drew close, many of them falling into German trenches as they were shot. After about two hours, the British attack abated, when cheers were heard from Beaumont Hamel behind them and a line of German troops were seen in the mist, guarded by British troops. The mist lifted a little and many lines and waves of British troops were seen on the right flank advancing unopposed. A defensive flank was formed and fire opened on the British, causing many casualties, before a machine-gun began firing at them from behind and to the left, forcing them under cover. A machine-gun began enfilade fire from the right, causing many casualties. An unarmed German officer appeared and announced that he was a prisoner and that the British were through the support and reserve positions and in Beaumont Hamel. The Germans discussed their prospects and surrendered when British troops began bombing along the trench.
Further south, Infantry Regiment 55 (IR55) of the 38th Division was forced to withdraw to avoid being surrounded after the breakthrough at Beaumont Hamel, allowing the British to advance around St Pierre Divion and Beaucourt; the British taking prisoners, including all of I Battalion, 23rd Regiment and its headquarters. On the north bank, the survivors of IR55 made a stand in the on the west side of Beaucourt, running towards (Old Württemberg Redoubt) from which, with part of the 223rd Division, they devastated two British battalions advancing closer to the river; its reserve regiment was rushed to early on 14 November. On the south bank, the 38th Division was being relieved by part of the 223rd Division, which having been formed a month earlier from youths and returning wounded, was of limited efficiency. The British barrage here was accurate and St Pierre Divion was captured with the loss of 

Attempts to reinforce the troops on both banks of the Ancre began immediately. Infantry Regiment 144 (IR144) of the 223rd Division was rushed to Beaucourt and Ancre Trench behind the village. A battalion moved up on the south bank of the river then crossed an improvised bridge to occupy Puisieux Trench but no counter-attack could be organised amid the chaos. Some German troops in Beaucourt were attacked from behind and by the British were consolidating the village. Part of the 26th Reserve Division was hurried south from near Cambrai by lorry and forced march, then sent to join the remnants of the 12th Division around Beaumont Hamel. Ground to a depth of had been lost in the Ancre valley and German troops fought hard to contain the British advance around Beaucourt and Grandcourt. On the morning of 14 November, British artillery cut the link between the and but British attacks were costly failures. South and east of Grandcourt, British attacks from Stump Road during the morning were repulsed. The German command believed that the British offensive had ended on 14 November and the German 2nd Army commander General Max von Gallwitz and Crown Prince Rupprecht requested leave (Gallwitz had to wait).

====18 November====
The British tried again to capture Serre by taking Redoubt to the south and early on had success in confused fighting, when the headquarters of III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 77 in Serre was captured. In a costly defensive success, which owed much to the great assistance from German artillery, the British attack was defeated by the evening, with many British soldiers being captured as they tried to withdraw and their prisoners liberated. In the Ancre valley the 58th Division on the south bank, was being relieved by the 56th Division when the British attack began. The German positions began north of Regina Trench at (Desire Trench) which was held by patrols as a decoy away from (Desire Support Trench), the main line of defence back in (Little Gully), an eastern extension of (Little Hollow). was south of (Boom Ravine). About behind these defences lay , which the Germans were able partly to wire before 18 November. The last line of defence was (Grandcourt Trench) and machine-gun nests along Boom Ravine.

The British attack got forward beyond Beaucourt, despite many casualties caused by massed German machine-gun fire and local counter-attacks. On the south bank the front of the 106th Regiment was broken and &quot;I&quot; Battalion 120th Reserve Regiment was destroyed by an attack from behind. The 144th and 29th Regiments defended Grandcourt, where the 29th Regiment was defeated and the survivors pushed into the area of the 144th Regiment further east. South of Grandcourt, at the 173rd regiment had been overrun by the time they emerged from their dugouts. The 8th North Staffordshire pressed on and was cut off and eventually surrendered. German troops who had not been pushed back into , were ordered to retire there in the evening of 18 November. Further east the German defence of the Pys–Courcelette road was forced back, until a counter-attack stopped the British advance. By the evening, German defenders held ground either side of the road, in an arc between and the east end of Regina Trench.

===French armies===

French operations south of the Somme were delayed by bad weather until 7 November. Bois Kratz, Pressoir and Ablaincourt were captured by the Tenth Army. Numerous German counter-attacks, including a big attack, after a two-day bombardment, at Bois Kratz and Pressoir on 15 November were defeated, after the Germans had gained a foothold at the east end of Pressoir and then been pushed out. North of the Somme, German attacks on the Sixth Army, from south of Bouchavesnes to Lesbœufs, captured the north corner and western fringe of St Pierre Vaast Wood but were repulsed along the rest of the attack front; French counter-attacks made progress on the northern spur of St Pierre Vaast Wood. On the morning of 16 November, the Germans entered Saillisel and Presssoir further south, by the evening they had been forced out; three German divisions had suffered many casualties. French airmen fought with German aeroplanes; on the night of French night bombers dropped of bombs on a railway station and aviation park. Preparations began for an advance to a line from Mazancourt to Happlincourt and Biaches, ready for a spring offensive.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
A 1st Army investigation of the at Beaumont Hamel found that the weeks of bombardment, lately from the flank and rear, had destroyed the German trenches and wire, although in the front line, most dugouts, deep, survived. Each morning the British simulated an attack, which sapped the alertness of the defenders. The real attack began after of (drumfire); the German defensive barrage failed to have much effect, due to visibility being nil in the fog, leaving the infantry unsupported. The 12th Division was blamed for lacking solidity and discipline and the divisional headquarters was severely criticised for inertia, which had only been remedied when the 1st Army headquarters took over. Edmund Blunden called the battle &quot;a feat of arms with any recorded. The enemy was surprised and beaten&quot;.

A dispute exists among historians as to the motives for the attack. Gough was visited by Kiggell on 12 November and told that a tactical success would be helpful at the forthcoming conference at Chantilly, although he emphasised that Gough was not to begin a battle under unfavourable conditions. During the writing of the Official History volume in 1938, Kiggell recounted that he had suggested the attack and had remarked that a &quot;cheap&quot; success would counter rumoured hostility from Lloyd George, just before the conference due on 15 November, as &quot;an afterthought&quot;. Kiggell asked that Haig&#x27;s later mentioning of his remark to Gough be omitted, to deny an opportunity for Haig&#x27;s critics to criticise his motives. James Edmonds, the official historian, amended Miles&#x27; text to make Kiggell the origin of the political calculation, give due emphasis to operational considerations and deference to the tactical judgement of Gough by Haig and Kiggell

In 2005, Prior and Wilson claimed that Gough had been put in an invidious position and that having the meeting recorded by his Chief of Staff Neil Malcolm, was &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Haig had arrived later and described to Gough some of his strategic thinking, that an attack would prevent the transfer of German divisions to the Romanian front, discourage criticism of France and Britain by pro-German opinion in Russia and would give him a success to take to the forthcoming Chantilly Conference, although he stressed that an attack should not be pursued at too great a risk. Prior and Wilson claimed that a small success on the Somme was unlikely to make much difference to Romania and Russia and was &quot;sophistry&quot;. In 2009, Philpott called the &quot;shock&quot; that the Fifth Army gave to the Germans on the Ancre, an attack which demonstrated who had won the Battle of the Somme. Philpott described the grounds that historians have given for calling the battle unnecessary and politically motivated in a paragraph, then compared the battle with the attack of 1 July and quoted Ludendorff describing it as &quot;a heavy blow&quot;.

The British had taken Edmund Blunden and Arthur Waterhouse, who took part, had written on the success of the battle and that the British had matched the Germans, who had defeated them at Beaumont Hamel on 1 July. Philpott contradicted Prior and Wilson and their claim that the War Committee had ignored Haig&#x27;s &quot;flights of fancy&quot; and wrote that in October the battle &quot;still had potential&quot;. Philpott described a conference at Boulogne, where Lloyd George failed to challenge the strategic consensus, was &quot;maybe too pusillanimous&quot; and should have resigned if he really opposed the battle. Philpott made the fate of Rumania the main concern of French and British politicians. [Haig&#x27;s diary entry for 13 November, contains references to politico-strategic concerns relating to the battle but these are not &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Similar entries are found on and 2 November, describing Anglo-French political and strategic relationships as they affected military operations on the Somme in October and November.]

===Casualties===

Casualties in the 32nd Division from were , more than 50 percent being &quot;missing&quot;. Losses in the 37th Division from were sickness as well as casualties. In the 51st (Highland) Division from there were approximately Losses in the 2nd Division from were about and those of the 3rd Division from were . The 63rd Division lost approximately from The British Fifth Army had 23,274 casualties from and inflicted so many casualties ( including from , that two divisions were relieved twice, in what Ludendorff called &quot;a particularly heavy blow&quot;. In 1919, J. H. Boraston claimed prisoners, including 

===Subsequent operations===
On 19 November troops of the 19th Division defeated a German counter-attack at the west end of Grandcourt. Another defensive position was dug from the Ancre to Battery Alley away from the Grandcourt line, from which the British retired, as they were overlooked from the south end of the Grandcourt line, where it was still held by the Germans. Puisieux trench was abandoned, when the 19th Division was withdrawn from Grandcourt that night. The Battle of the Somme lasted from on the British reckoning. In the southern sector, the Fourth Army ended operations on 16 November and on the French sector, the final action took place on in St Pierre Vaast Wood. On 22 November, part of the 96th Brigade tried to rescue infantry of the 16th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, who were trapped in Frankfort Trench south of the Redoubt; the effort failed and the survivors surrendered.

The German (1st and 2nd), French (Sixth and Tenth) and British (Fourth and Reserve/Fifth) armies, settled down to endure winter on the Somme. The British kept pressure on the German defenders with artillery fire, air attacks during bright spells and propaganda leaflets, purporting to be from German prisoners praising their treatment, although mud, icy winds, sleet and driving rain may have had more effect. Illness and exposure became common among German troops and at the end of 1916 was almost universal, leading to numerous reports warning that the German troops in the area, were unlikely to be able to resist further attacks. British attacks resumed in the Operations on the Ancre in January 1917.

<text>James Wallace McKenzie (June 16, 1914 in Plenty, Saskatchewan – September 11, 1999) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1986.

McKenzie was the son of homesteaders who had moved to Manitoba from Ontario. In the 1930s, he earned extra money by performing in dance bands. He was educated in Saskatchewan and did not attend university, working as a grain buyer after leaving school. In 1939, McKenzie married Hilda Rose Pritchard. McKenzie served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1941 to 1945 and returned to his old job following the conclusion of World War II. When his employer was bought out by Pool elevators, he opened a grocery store in Inglis, Manitoba which he operated for 30 years.

From 1955 to 1963, he was a member of the Inglis town council. He also served as President of the North Central Hockey League in 1965.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1966, in the riding of Roblin, defeating New Democrat Joseph Perchaluk by just over 200 votes. He did not serve in the cabinets of Dufferin Roblin or Walter Weir, and sat as a backbench MLA on the government side for the next three years.

In the provincial election of 1969, McKenzie narrowly defeated fellow incumbent Michael Kawchuk of the NDP in the redistributed riding of Roblin; Kawchuk&#x27;s constituency, Ethelbert Plains, had been abolished. The NDP under Edward Schreyer formed government after this election, and McKenzie moved to the opposition benches. He was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1973 election, with the lack of a Liberal challenger making his re-election bid easier.

The Progressive Conservatives returned to power under Sterling Lyon in the 1977 election. McKenzie, easily re-elected in his own riding, was named Deputy Speaker of the assembly on November 24, 1977. He did not serve in Lyon&#x27;s cabinet.

Amid the NDP replacing the Tories as the government and Howard Pawley replacing Lyon as Premier of Manitoba, McKenzie was re-elected again for the new riding of Roblin-Russell in 1981. He retired from politics at the 1986 Manitoba general election.

He died in Russell at the age of 85.

<text>The ilish (Tenualosa ilisha) (), also known as the ilishi, hilsa, hilsa herring or hilsa shad, is a species of fish related to the herring, in the family Clupeidae. It is a very popular and sought-after food in the Bengal region, and is the national fish of Bangladesh and state fish of the Indian state of West Bengal.

As of 2023, 97% of the world&#x27;s total ilish supply originates in Bangladesh. The fish contributes about 12% of the total fish production and about 1.15% of GDP in Bangladesh. On 6 August 2017, Department of Patents, Designs and Trademarks under the Ministry of Industries declared ilish as a Geographical Indication of Bangladesh. About 450,000 people are directly involved in the catching of the fish as a large part of their livelihood; around four to five million people are indirectly involved with the trade.

==Common names==
Other names include jatka, illi, ilish, ellis, palla fish, hilsha, ilih etc. (: ilih/ilihi, , : Modar or Palva, , Sindhī: پلو مڇي pallo machhi, , Telugu: పులస pulasa). The name ilish is also used in India&#x27;s Assamese, Bengali, and Odia communities. In Iraq it is called sboor (صبور). In Malaysia and Indonesia, it is commonly known as terubok. Due to its distinguished features as being oily and tender, some Malays, especially in northern Johore, call it &quot; (to distinguish it from the toli - which species is rich in tiny bones and not so oily). In Myanmar, it is called () in Burmese which derives from the Mon language word ကသလံက် with က in Mon and in Burmese meaning fish.

== Description ==
Females of the species grow larger than males, with males individuals not reaching over 46 cm. Females can reach lengths of up to 55 cm. Maturity is generally attained by the end of the first year or the start of the second, with males maturing at sizes of 26–29 cm and females at 31–33 cm.

It has no dorsal spines but 18 – 21 dorsal soft rays and anal soft rays. The belly has 30 to 33 scutes. There is a distinct median notch in the upper jaw. Gill rakers fine and numerous, about 100 to 250 on the lower part of the arch and the fins are hyaline. The fish shows a dark blotch behind gill opening, followed by a series of small spots along the flank in juveniles. While alive, the fish is silver shot with gold and purple.
==Habitat and breeding==

The fish is marine; freshwater; brackish; pelagic-neritic; anadromous; depth range of about 200 m. Within a tropical range; 34°N - 5°N, 42°E - 97°E in marine and freshwater. It is found in rivers and estuaries in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and the Persian Gulf area where it can be found in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in and around Iran and southern Iraq. The fish schools in coastal waters and ascends up the rivers (anadromous) for around 50 – 100 km to spawn during the southwest monsoons (June to September and January to April). Actual peak breeding season of the fish is a topic of debate amongst the researchers.

After spawning, they return to the sea which are known as &quot;Jatka&quot; in Bangladesh (fish size up to 9 cm), although some stocks remain resident in rivers.

Since the 1900s, numerous efforts have been made to breed and cultivate hilsa across South Asia, especially in India and Bangladesh. However, no significant success has been achieved in completing the fish&#x27;s life cycle in captivity.

===Feeding habit===
The species filter feeds on plankton and forages in muddy bottoms. Its diet primarily consists of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), Chlorophyceae (green algae), and crustaceans (Copepoda and Cladocera). While adults generally feed on Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae, juveniles primarily depend on crustaceans.

==Production==

The fish is found in 11 countries: Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Bangladesh is the top hilsa-producing country in the world, followed by Myanmar and then India.
An estimated 97% of the total hilsa catch comes from Bangladesh. Ilish production in the country increased by 92% from 2008 to 2023.

==Food value==

The fish is popular food amongst the people of South Asia and in the Middle East, but especially with Bengalis, Odias and Telugus of Coastal Andhra. Bengali fish curry is a popular dish made with mustard oil or seed. The Bengalis popularly call this dish Shorshe Ilish. It is very popular in Bengal (Bangladesh and India&#x27;s West Bengal), as well as in Odisha, Tripura, Assam, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. It is also exported globally.

Ilish collected from Bangladesh is regarded the finest of all, celebrated for its size and subtle taste.

In North America (where ilish is not always readily available) other shad fish are sometimes used as an ilish substitute, especially in Bengali cuisine. This typically occurs near the East coast of North America, where fresh shad fish, which tastes similar to ilish, can be found.

In Bangladesh, fish are caught in the Meghna-Jamuna delta, which flows into the Bay of Bengal and Meghna (lower Brahmaputra), and Jamuna rivers.

In India, Rupnarayan (which has the &quot;Kolaghater hilsa&quot;), Hooghly, Mahanadi, Narmada and Godavari rivers and the Chilika Lake are famous for their fish yields.

In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, hilsa takes on a special significance. Here, the term &quot;pulasa&quot; refers specifically to the larger, mature hilsa that migrate upstream along the Godavari River. This migratory journey is crucial, as it&#x27;s believed that the Godavari&#x27;s unique muddy waters contribute to the development of a richer flavour and firmer texture in the fish, compared to hilsa caught elsewhere. Due to this perceived superior quality and its limited seasonal availability (typically monsoon season), pulasa commands a significantly higher price and cultural importance in Andhra Pradesh. It is considered a rich delicacy, often referred to as the &quot;king of fish&quot; in Godavari Areas and features in celebratory meals and as a prized gift. The upstream migration itself is seen as a vital natural process, and the pulasa a reward for the patient fishermen who wait for its arrival.

In Pakistan, most hilsa fish are caught in the Indus River Delta in Sindh. They are also caught in the sea, but some consider the marine stage of the fish as not so tasty. The fish has very sharp and tough bones, making it problematic to eat for some.

Ilish is an oily fish rich in omega 3 fatty acids. Recent experiments have shown its beneficial effects in decreasing cholesterol level in rats and insulin level.

In Bengal and Odisha, ilish can be smoked, fried, steamed or baked in young plantain leaves, prepared with mustard seed paste, curd, aubergine, different condiments like jira (cumin) and so on. It is said that people can cook ilish in more than 50 ways. Ilish roe is also popular as a side dish. Ilish can be cooked in very little oil since the fish itself is very oily.

==Ilish in culture==

* Ilish is the national fish of Bangladesh.
* In Andhra Pradesh, the saying goes &quot;Pustelu ammi ayina Pulasa tinocchu&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;It&#x27;s worth eating Pulasa/Ilish even if you have to sell your mangala sutra. Hilsa is also known as pulasa in Godavari districts of the state. The name Pulasa stays with the fish for a limited period between July–Sept of a year, when floods raise the Godavari River. This time the fish is in high demand and sometimes $100 per kilo.
* In many Bengali Hindu families a pair of ilish fishes (Bengali: &quot;Jora Ilish&quot;) are bought on auspicious days, for example for special prayers or puja days like for the Hindu Goddess of music, art and knowledge Saraswati Puja, which takes place in the beginning of spring or on the day of Lakshmi Puja (the Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity) which takes place in autumn. Some people offer the fish to the goddess Lakshmi, without which the Puja is sometimes thought to be incomplete. It is often given as gifts (Bengali: &quot;tattwa&quot;) in Bengali weddings.

* Hilsa is also known in Sindh as Pallo Machi and is important part of Sindhi cuisine, prepared with numerous cooking methods. It can be deep fried and garnished with local spices, can be cooked with onions and potatoes into a traditional fish meal or barbequed. The fish often has roe, which is called &quot;aani&quot; in Sindhi and is enjoyed as a delicacy. Often fried alongside the palla and served with the fish fillets.
* The rivalry of East Bengal and Mohon Bagan, two football clubs of Kolkata are celebrated by food. When East Bengal wins, an ilish (hilsha) dish is cooked by the East Bengal supporters. Similarly, when Mohon Bagan wins, a Chingri (Prawn) dish is prepared by the Mohon Bagan supporters. These items often occur in the tifos of these respective clubs. 

==Overfishing==

Due to the demand and popularity of this species, overfishing is rampant. Fishes weighing around 2 to 3 kilograms have become rare in India, as even the smaller fish are caught using finer fishing nets as production in Bangladesh have increased. As a consequence of this, prices of the fish have risen. In the past ilish were not harvested between Vijaya Dashami and Saraswati Puja due to some informal customs of Odia and Bengali Hindus as it is the breeding period of the fish. But as disposable incomes grew, wealthier consumers abandoned the old traditions.

The advent of finer fishing nets and advanced trawling techniques, and environmental degradation of the rivers, has worsened the situation. Fishermen have been ignoring calls to at least leave the juvenile &quot;jatka&quot; alone to repopulate the species. The fishing of the young jatka is now illegal in Bangladesh. This ban however has resulted in a rise in unemployment, as around 83,000 fishermen are unable to pursue their former livelihood for eight months every year. It has also led to the creation of a black market where jatka are sold for exorbitant prices. Furthermore, the changes brought about by global warming have led to a gradual depletion of the ilish&#x27;s breeding grounds, reducing populations of the fish even further. Pollution in rivers have worsened the situation, but due to slightly better waters the fishes are found more near Bangladesh delta. Owing to this situation ilish is used as a diplomatic trade item, most recently in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

Bangladesh has regularly imposed restrictions on the export of ilish abroad, citing its scarcity. Despite this, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina periodically lifted the ban to allow the annual export and gifted of 3,000-5,000 tonnes of fish to India during the Durga Puja, popularly known as &quot;Hilsa Diplomacy&quot;. Since the fall of the Hasina government, the interim government of Bangladesh has imposed a ban on ilish exports, which was partially lifted on 21 September 2024 to allow for the export of 3,000 tonnes of fish for Durga Puja.

<doc id="1310832" wikidata="Q3272730" url="?curid=1310832" title="MAX (group)">
<text>MAX is a Japanese female vocal group. The name is an acronym for &quot;musical active experience&quot;. The original members of MAX made their musical debut as members of the Super Monkey&#x27;s along with lead vocalist Namie Amuro. They branched out on their own in 1995, becoming stars in their own right with selling several million albums and a string of consecutive top 20 singles from 1996 to 2000. Their lead singer, Mina, left the group in 2002 due to pregnancy and was replaced by Aki Maeda who assumed the stage name Aki. Aki left the group in August 2008 to pursue a solo career. Original member Mina returned to the group on October 28, 2008 ushering in the group&#x27;s comeback after a two-year hiatus.

Since their debut MAX has sold over 10 million records. They are behind only Morning Musume for female group with the most consecutive top 10 singles, tying with Wink at 15. 

==Members==
When the group debuted all members used their real names. Once they became popular they used stage names each possessing the suffix &quot;na.&quot; Lina (Ritsuko) used to go by &quot;Rina&quot;. However, because of the similarity to &quot;Reina&quot; and the fact that her nickname more closely matched &quot;Lina&quot; anyway, this became her name around the time of their first CD. During informal footage such as backstage of their concerts, Mina and Nana are referred to by their full names, Minako and Nanako. The only member not to take on a stage name with the suffix is former member, Aki.

All members of the group hail from Okinawa Prefecture including their latest member.

===Current members===
*, known as Mina (b. 29 December 1977)
*, known as Nana (b. 25 March 1976)
*, known as Reina (b. 6 January 1978)
*, known as Lina (b. 26 February 1977)

===Former members===
*, known as AKI (b. 22 October 1980). Before joining MAX, she had made her professional music debut in the short lived group, Hipp&#x27;s.

==History==
===The beginning===
MAX started off as just a project that was never meant to take off. The group&#x27;s concept was simple. They were presented as a singing and dancing pop group who performed catchy dance music. In 1995, they released their first single to very little success. Their second single was released to the same fate. The group continued to perform with Namie Amuro under the name, Super Monkey&#x27;s, until the group officially disbanded in the summer of that year. Even though the Super Monkey&#x27;s were over, MAX performed as dancers for Namie Amuro throughout the early stages of her solo career until March 1996. The foursome&#x27;s dual identity as SuperMonkeys and MAX is captured in the video, &quot;Amuro Namie First Anniversary Live at Marine Stadium&quot; where they performed as Namie&#x27;s backup singers and dancers, then Namie announces and congratulates them as MAX.

That month, the girls released their first movie, &quot;Ladie&#x27;s MAX&quot; and their third single, &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;, which debuted at #19 giving them their first hit and ending their days as glorified backup dancers.

===Stardom===
MAX followed the success of &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot; with &quot;Seventies&quot; which brought the girls their first top 10 hit. In December 1996, they released their debut album &quot;Maximum&quot;. The album debuted at #1 and went on to sell over one million copies. Following the success of their album, MAX went back to the big screen in the sequel to their first movie, &quot;Ladie&#x27;s MAX.&quot; The theme song to the movie entitled &quot;Give me a Shake&quot; was the first original song they performed. Before this song, all of MAX&#x27;s hits were covers of Italian dance music. When the eponymous theme song &quot;Give me a Shake&quot; was released as a single it debuted at #1 garnering the group their first and only #1 hit.

In the fall of 1997, MAX went on their first national tour dubbed &quot;J-Pop Gig Tour&quot;. Spanning only two months, the group played sold-out halls including the Nippon Budokan. They released their second album, &quot;Maximum II&quot; on Christmas Day. That album also went on to sell over a million copies. MAX appearing for the first time on Kouhaku Utagassen at the end of 1997 and continued their reign at the top of the music scene throughout 1998. In 1999, MAX released their first greatest hits collection entitled &quot;Maximum Collection&quot; which also topped the charts. The girls scored a major hit at the end of the year with their first ballad single entitled, &quot;Issho ni.&quot; Although the single had charted in the lower half of the top 10, it stayed on the charts for four months selling over 300,000 copies. It would be their second best selling single.

===Turning Point===
2000 proved to be a time of change for MAX. For their first single of the new millennium, the girls decided to take control of their music by writing and producing for the first time. Their result, &quot;Never Gonna Stop It&quot;, an R&amp;B influence pop number debuted at #8 on the charts. However, the single fell short of sales of 100,000 copies. Since 1999, the group&#x27;s sales were gradually declining but this was the first time since their third single that any of their singles did not surpass the hundred thousand mark. Their next self-produced effort, &quot;Magic&quot; would debut at #10 but sold less than the previous single. The next few years were more of the same.

The group came to a dramatic standstill when in January 2002, the group&#x27;s lead singer, Mina, announced her quickie marriage and pregnancy in a press conference at their record label, Avex Trax&#x27;s main office. At the press conference, the group also announced that Mina would take a hiatus from the group to have her baby. They released their second ballad single, &quot;Spring Rain&quot; the following month to disastrous results. The single charted a lowly #28 breaking their string of 19 consecutive top 20 singles. An original album, their fifth, due for release in March was shelved and instead a second greatest hits collection was released in its place. MAX went into hiatus.

===Muted Comeback===
The next few months remained quiet for MAX, until late June when news started circulating around fan websites that flyers announcing a new MAX member were seen. The three remaining members (Nana, Lina and Reina) had previously announced that they would either: 1) continue as a three-member group or 2) remain in hiatus until Mina returned. In either case, they were adamant that no one would replace Mina.

Soon after came the news of an official fanclub meeting in July. On the day of the meeting, a three-member MAX came out to a crowded club performing their #1 smash, &quot;Give me a Shake.&quot; Shortly following the performance, MAX confirmed rumors by introducing their new member, Aki Maeda. Aki&#x27;s position in the band was initially uncertain, rumors were that she was either just a temporary member until Mina&#x27;s return or upon Mina&#x27;s return MAX would become a five-member group.

A new single and album were scheduled for release the next month along with TV appearances on some of the biggest music shows in the country. However, the single would be cancelled. The album, &quot;Maximum Trance&quot; containing trance remixes of old material would be released as scheduled. Their new television appearances were cancelled as well.

In November, MAX finally made their comeback with the bossa nova influenced single, &quot;Eternal White&quot;. The single debuted at #20 and quickly fell off the charts. Subsequent releases continued to come with larger distances in time. The group released two singles in 2003 both failing to reach the top 30. In 2004, the group released a cover of Atomic Kitten&#x27;s &quot;Be with You&quot;. The single debuted at #34 after a promising but ultimately disappointing promotional push. In August, the group performed in the United States for the first time at Texas&#x27; AnimeFest held at the Hyatt Hotel in Dallas. Following the event, MAX took time out to participate in solo activities including modeling and acting.

===10th Anniversary===
In 2005, the group celebrated their 10th anniversary. Although the group had not released any new material after the release of &quot;Be With You,&quot; they embarked on a hotel tour to commemorate the anniversary. The &quot;MAX Love Trip 2005&quot; spanned four shows in May. During the hotel tour, the group confirmed a new single entitled &quot;Nirai Kanai&quot; for release in July. The single would be a return to their roots incorporating Eurodance beats with traditional Okinawan elements. MAX also had a greater input in this single, not only picking the song but also writing the lyrics and even performing a bit of the instrumental. The group coined the term &quot;Okinawan Euro&quot; to describe the song. In an interview with &quot;Barks.co.jp,&quot; the group explained that the long wait for the single was due to their search for the perfect song. They also stated that unlike in the past where they would release singles in a certain time span, that they would now concentrate on only releasing &quot;good&quot; music regardless of how long it takes. Upon release, the single was only able to capture a few thousand sales on the mainland. However, the song proved to be a runaway hit in Okinawa allowing the group to have several live events on the island. They followed up &quot;Nirai Kanai&quot; with another single in November and released their first album with new member, Aki in February 2006, entitled, &quot;Jewel of Jewels.&quot; Another single entitled &quot;Splash Gold (Natsu no Kiseki)/Prism of Eyes,&quot; the group&#x27;s first double a-side single was released in August of that year. It became the group&#x27;s final release with new member, Aki.

=== 2008–2011: Original line-up reformation and 15th anniversary ===

On August 12, 2008, it was announced Aki would be leaving the group to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter. The group made their last public appearance with Aki at the Japanese premiere of the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; film. In October, Lina and Reina told fans that they had been in meetings with their record label. They did not discuss the details of the meeting, however, claimed that all would be revealed soon. On October 28, a press release was issued announcing the return of original member, Mina, and an official comeback. They made their first public appearance on Tokudane and a reunion concert and new remix album were announced. The reunion concert was held on January 31, 2009 as a one-night only event at C.C. Lemon Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo. Its success led to announcement of six additional shows turning the concert event into a nationwide tour. On the first night of the tour, their first comeback single, &quot;Rough Cut Diamond&quot; was announced. It was released on July 22, 2009.

In late 2009, the group announced a one-night monthly concerts series, &quot;MAX Monthly Live: VIP&quot; to celebrate the group&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 2010. The first concert of the series was held on January 24 at Akazaka Blitz in Tokyo. On May 12, a Eurobeat cover of Anri&#x27;s &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; was released. It was followed by the release of a Eurobeat cover album composed of 80s and 90s classics and anime songs. &quot;BE MAX&quot; was released on September 8. The album debuted at #19 on the Oricon Weekly Album Chart becoming their first top 20 release since 2002&#x27;s &quot;eternal white.&quot; On September 17, the group appeared on the variety program &quot;Nakai Masahiro no Kinyoubi no Smatachi e&quot;. The program revealed that they had been in turmoil following Mina&#x27;s pregnancy. Although the group had shown solidarity following the announcement, it was a farce. The other three members stated that they had felt betrayed by Mina&#x27;s actions because she did not confide her pregnancy to them herself but through management. The incident created a major rift between the original members and although Aki had been announced as a temporary member while Mina would take maternity leave, Mina had actually already exited the group. The program later revealed that after Aki left the group to pursue a solo career, Nana suggested to the remaining members that they invite Mina to rejoin them. At the conclusion of the program, Mina formally apologized to the group.

On May 21, 2011, the group&#x27;s management announced that Reina was five months pregnant and would take maternity leave immediately. The announcement also affirmed that MAX would continue activities while Reina remained on hiatus. The group made their final appearance as a four-member group on Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ in late July where the remaining members performed for the first time as a three-piece unit.

=== 2012–present: Hare, Tokidoki Farm! and MAX is back ===
As part of NHK&#x27;s BS Premium&#x27;s programming block catered to women, the network announced the weekly variety show, &quot;Hare, Tokidoki Farm!&quot; starring MAX. On the program, the members would hone horticulture and craftsmanship skills with local farmers and guest celebrities. The program premiered in April 2012 and featured MAX&#x27;s first recording as a three-piece, &quot;Check Me!&quot; as its theme song. On April 17, MAX was announced as spokespersons for Sapporo Beer&#x27;s wheat and lemon line of beverages. Another original song, &quot;Sun Sun,&quot; was used in a commercial campaign aired exclusively in Okinawa.

In October 2012, Reina revealed to fans that she had given birth to her first child, a boy, in November 2011 and that she was six months pregnant with her second child. In February 2013, she announced the birth of her second child, a girl, and confirmed that she would be continuing her maternity leave until further notice. At the end of February, MAX wrapped their tenure on &quot;Hare, Tokidoki Farm!&quot; and shortly afterwards, Lina informed fans through her blog that MAX had entered into meetings for a planned single release. In late July, a new single was formally announced touting &quot;MAX is back.&quot; &quot;Tacata&#x27;&quot; released on August 7, is a cover of Tacabro&#x27; song of the same name and is their first single as a three-member unit. In 2015, the trio released their cover of the Chainsmokers song &quot;#SELFIE&quot;, now titled &quot;#SELFIE ~ONNA Now~&quot;. The song was released to celebrate MAX&#x27;s 20th anniversary. That year, Reina also had her third child, a boy.

In 2019, another MAX single, &quot;Parthenon&quot;, was released to celebrate Reina&#x27;s return to the group.

<doc id="1310841" wikidata="Q1683034" url="?curid=1310841" title="Janus Capital Group">
<text>Janus Capital Group, Inc. was an American publicly owned investment firm headquartered in Denver, Colorado. It was founded by Thomas H. Bailey as Stilwell Financial Incorporated in 1969. Outside the U.S., Janus had offices in Sydney, Paris, Zürich, Frankfurt, Dubai, Taipei, London, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Singapore. It was a constituent of the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index.

It merged with Henderson Group in May 2017 to create Janus Henderson.

==History==
Janus was founded by Thomas H. Bailey in 1969. A controlling interest was purchased by Kansas City Southern Industries in 1984. Kansas City Southern Industries then demerged its financial services businesses to create Stilwell Financial in 1999. Bailey stepped down as president and CEO in June 2002.

The company was renamed Janus Capital Group, following the integration of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial, in January 2003.

The Janus Fund opened in 1970 with approximately a few hundred thousand dollars in assets.

Further funds were launched in 1985, including the Janus Venture Fund, its first small cap equity fund, and the Janus Twenty Fund, its first concentrated equity fund.

In 1991, Janus launched a number of other new types of fund, including its first global equity fund, the Janus Worldwide Fund, its first international equity fund, the Janus Overseas Fund, and its first mid cap equity fund, the Janus Enterprise Fund. It also launched the Janus Aspen Series (JAS), a product line created for investors wanting to invest in Janus through variable insurance contracts or certain qualified retirement plans.

Myron Scholes, Nobel laureate and Ph.D., joined Janus as chief investment strategist on July 8, 2014.

On September 26, 2014, Bill Gross left Pimco to join Janus as manager of the Janus global unconstrained bond strategy.

In October 2014, Janus acquired VS Holdings, a company based in Darien, Connecticut, and its VelocityShares business.

In July 2015, Janus acquired a majority interest in Kapstream Capital, a fixed income specialist.

In February 2016, Janus launched a small cap growth and small cap/mid cap growth ETF, followed in June by four new ETFs around investment themes – long-term care, health and fitness, organic foods and personal care.

On October 3, 2016, Janus Capital Group Inc and Henderson Group plc announced their merger, creating Janus Henderson.

<doc id="1310858" wikidata="Q488735" url="?curid=1310858" title="Ahn Chang Ho">
<text>Ahn Chang Ho (; November 9, 1878 – March 10, 1938), sometimes An Chang-ho, was a prominent Korean politician, Korean independence activist, and an early leader of the Korean-American immigrant community in the United States. He is also commonly referred to by his art name Dosan (; ).

He and his wife were the first Koreans to legally immigrate to the US as a married couple. Ahn was a Protestant social activist who in 1907 established the later prominent Korean independence organization Shinminhoe when he returned to Korea from the US. He also established the Young Korean Academy in San Francisco in 1913, and was a key founding member of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai in 1919. He is also one of two men believed to have written the lyrics of the South Korean national anthem, &quot;Aegukga&quot;.

==Early life==
Ahn was born Ahn Chi-sam () on 9 November 1878 in Kangso County, Pyeongan Province, Joseon (present-day South Pyongan, North Korea). He was the third son of father An Hŭng-kuk, and mother Hwang Mong-un. Ahn came from the Sunheung Ahn clan, and his ancestry can be traced back to the prominent Goryeo scholar Ahn Hyang.

Ahn was born into an impoverished farming family during the unstable last few decades of the Joseon dynasty. He began studying at a seodang around age 8 in preparation for the gwageo, the demanding civil service examinations that determined placement in government intellectual jobs. After his father died when he was around age 11, he was raised by his grandfather.

Ahn changed his name around age 10; his father also changed his name from Ahn Kyo-jin to Ahn Heung-guk.

In 1895, 16-year-old Ahn was disturbed by the destruction of the First Sino-Japanese War, and became determined to improve Korea. He moved to Seoul to receive a Western-style education at a Presbyterian missionary-sponsored school in Seoul run by Horace Grant Underwood and Rev. F. S. Miller called Kusehaktang. He studied there for three years, converting to Christianity and working for Dr. Oliver R. Avison at Chejungwon, the first medical institution in Korea (now part of Yonsei University Medical Center).

Around 1897, he joined the Independence Club and became a leader of its Pyongyang branch. Through this short-lived club, he gave speeches to crowds of hundreds and became associated with people who would become prominent in the independence movement, including Syngman Rhee and Yun Chi-ho. He also became engaged to his future wife Helen Ahn around this time.

He then returned to his home province of Pyeongan, and around 1899 established the Chŏmjin school, the first coeducational school founded by a Korean, and the T&#x27;anp&#x27;ori Church. He then decided to further his education by going to the US. He married Helen on 3 September 1902, and shortly afterwards departed for the US.

== Immigration to America ==

On October 14, 1902, Ahn and his wife arrived in San Francisco. They were among the first Koreans to move to the US, and the first married Korean couple to do so, with passports numbered 51 and 52. In order to learn how to speak English, Ahn enrolled in an American primary school. He also sought work from Koreans who had already settled there.

The couple had a difficult time finding work due to anti-Asian sentiment and their poor English skills. While work was available in the agricultural sector, Korean immigrants still had a difficult time getting employment there due to a Japanese monopoly on labor contracts and the lack of their own labor bureau.

=== Pachappa Camp ===

In 1904, they moved to Riverside after encouragement from two Korean friends who worked on citrus farms there. There, Ahn acquired employment at Alta Cresta Groves and help establishing the Korean Employment Bureau (also &quot;Korean Labor Bureau&quot;), which contributed to the growth of the Korean population there. Ultimately, his efforts to bring Koreans there led to the establishment of Pachappa Camp, also sometimes called &quot;Dosan&#x27;s Republic&quot;. A number of academics and city of Riverside consider it to be the first Korean settlement in the US, and in 2017 the Camp was designated a &quot;Point of Cultural Interest&quot; by the Riverside City Council.

=== Korean National Association ===

Kim was a founder and leader of a series of early Korean American organizations that eventually become the Korean National Association.

On September 22, 1903, Ahn and eight others founded the first ever Korean American organization, the Korean Friendship Society, and he was elected its first president. During that time, around 20 Koreans lived in San Francisco, including the Ahn couple. In 1904, this group played a key role in settling and educating hundreds of Korean immigrants coming from Asian and from Hawaii. On 4 April 1905, the Society changed its name to the Mutual Assistance Society (or alternatively Mutual Assistance Association). Its headquarters was at 938 Pacific St. in San Francisco. As part of the Society, on 20 November 1905 Ahn cofounded the newspaper &quot;The United Korean&quot; (also &quot;Kong Lip Shinbo&quot; or &quot;The Independent&quot;), the predecessor of the 1909 newspaper &quot;Sinhan Minbo&quot;. During the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, their office burned down, leading them to publish from Oakland instead. The &quot;Sinhan Minbo&quot; would continue to publish and be a significant source of news about the Korean peninsula until well after World War II.

On March 23, 1908, the Durham Stevens assassination, in which Stevens was assassinated after publicly claiming that Korea was better off under Japanese occupation, led to anti-Korean sentiment. In response to this event, the Society merged with the Hawaii-based United Korean Society, becoming the Korean National Association on 10 February 1909. This combined group was widely considered to represent the Korean American community until the end of World War II.

== Return to Korea ==
In 1926, he departed by ship from San Pedro, California, to China. He would not return to the United States often from this point onwards, although he and his family were registered as residents of 106 North Figueroa St, Los Angeles, on April 24, 1930. During Ahn&#x27;s anti-Japanese activism in Korea, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese Imperial government at least five times. He was first arrested in 1909 in connection with Ahn Jung-geun&#x27;s assassination of Itō Hirobumi, the Japanese Resident General of Korea. Ahn was tortured and punished many times during the years of his activism. In 1932 he was arrested in Shanghai, China in connection with Yun Bong-gil&#x27;s bombing at Hongkew Park (April 29, 1932). He was a naturalized Chinese citizen at this time and illegally extradited back to Korea, where he was convicted of violating Japan&#x27;s &quot;Preservation of Peace Laws&quot; and sentenced to five years in Taejon prison.

===Death===
In 1937, Japanese authorities arrested Ahn, but due to complications from severe internal illness, he was released on bail and transferred to the Keijō Imperial University (now Seoul National University Hospital) where he died on March 10, 1938. Judging that Ahn Changho&#x27;s death might lead to a popular demonstration, the Japanese military limited the number of people attending the funeral, allowing only a small number of relatives to attend.

==Legacy and memorials==

Many consider Ahn Chang-ho to be one of the key moral and philosophical leaders of Korea during the 20th century. In the turmoil immediately before and during the Japanese occupation of Korea, he called for the moral and spiritual renewal of the Korean people through education as one of the important components in their struggle for independence and building a democratic society. Ahn also included economic and military components in his independence movement strategies.

Dosan Park and Memorial Hall were built to honor Ahn&#x27;s memory in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Another memorial was built in downtown Riverside, California, to honor him. Ahn&#x27;s family home on 36th Place in Los Angeles has been restored by the University of Southern California (USC), on whose campus it sits (albeit in a different location). Ahn never lived in the house on the USC campus since the Ahn family moved there in 1935 many years after Ahn had gone back to Shanghai.

At the request of Congresswoman Diane Watson, the USPS Post Office in Koreatown at Harvard and 6th Street was named Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Station. This was the first USPS naming honoring an Asian.
In 2011, the Ellis Island Foundation installed a plaque honoring Ahn to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his entrance to the United States through Ellis Island from London on September 3, 1911. He sailed from Glasgow aboard the SS &quot;Caledonia&quot;.

The City of Los Angeles, in the early 1990s, declared the nearby intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Van Buren Place - across from the Korean National Association and Korean Presbyterian church - to be named &quot;Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Square&quot; in his honor. In 2002, the main freeway interchange in downtown Los Angeles where the 10 Freeway and 110 Freeway meet was also renamed the Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Interchange.

The third pattern of ITF-style Taekwondo, which is made up of 24 movements, is called Do-San or Dosan in his honor. This is the pattern that is required to advance from 7th Kup Yellow Belt with Green Tag to 6th Kup Green Belt.

In 2012, Ahn was posthumously inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia. His grandson Philip Cuddy accepted the honor at the ceremony in Atlanta on behalf of Ahn.

On November 8, 2013, Ahn was given an Honorary Diploma by his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Yonsei University, in recognition of his service as teaching assistant at Gusae Hakdang and for his work at Jejungwon and Severance Hospital. Ahn was also a good influence on many Yonsei and Severance Medical School alumni. Susan Cuddy&#x27;s son, Philip Cuddy, initiated the awarding of the honorary diploma and provide the historical records. Yonsei President accepted the diploma in a ceremony in Seoul on behalf of Ahn.

The Republic of Korea Navy Dosan Ahn Changho-class submarine was named in his honor and the lead ship entered service on 13 August 2021.

==Personal life==
Ahn married Helen Ahn (née Lee) (; 21 April 1884 – 21 April 1969) on 3 September 1902, shortly before their immigration to the US, and they remained married until his death in 1938. She was a housewife and raised the couple&#x27;s children on her own for many years. She also actively supported the independence movement through local fundraising and community organizing. She was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation in 2008 by the South Korean government and is buried in Dosan Park, along with her husband.

The couple had three sons and two daughters. Sons Philip Ahn and Ralph Ahn were actors. Philip is considered the first Korean-American actor in Hollywood and one of the most prolific Asian-American actors of his time, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Susan Ahn Cuddy was a US Navy lieutenant who worked for the Office of Naval Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the Library of Congress, and the US Department of Defense. She was the first woman to serve as a gunnery officer in the U.S. Navy.

Soorah Ahn Buffum (; 27 May 1917 – 18 June 2016) was a restaurateur and 1948 graduate of USC. She died at age 99.

Philson Ahn (; 5 July 1912 – 23 May 2001) was an engineer and aerospace executive. He acted in minor roles in several films and attained his Bachelor in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. He never learned to speak Korean very well. Despite the mistrust of Asians during World War II, he worked at the Hughes Aircraft Company first as a chemist and later as a manager, and contributed to the development of the infamous Hughes H-4 Hercules. In the later parts of the war, he was later scouted by the US Office of Strategic Services, which worked on missions such as the Eagle Project to destabilize Japan, but was prevented from doing so by his company. He visited Korea for the first time in 1992 at age 79.

<doc id="1310890" wikidata="Q5322609" url="?curid=1310890" title="EBaum's World">
<text>eBaum&#x27;s World is an entertainment website owned by Literally Media. The site was founded in 2001 and features comedy content such as memes, viral videos, images, and other forms of Internet culture. Content is primarily user submitted in exchange for points through a monetary point system &quot;eBones.&quot;

== History of ownership ==
eBaum&#x27;s World originated in Rochester, New York, featuring entertainment media such as videos, Adobe Flash cartoons, and web games. The site was created and owned by Eric &quot;eBaum&quot; Bauman and his father, Neil. In August 2007, eBaum&#x27;s World was acquired by HandHeld Entertainment, also known as ZVUE Corporation, for $15 million up front, $2.5 million in HandHeld stock, and up to $52.5 million in cash and stock over 3 years.

On January 31, 2009, Bauman and the company&#x27;s staff were terminated by ZVUE and the company moved to the San Francisco ZVUE offices. As of 2016, the Israel-based company Literally Media held a controlling stake of eBaum&#x27;s World.

eBaum&#x27;s World is owned and operated by Literally Media, which also owns Cheezburger, Know Your Meme, and Cracked.com.

== Features ==
The site features individual celebrity soundboards, where users can click buttons to hear quotes or phrases spoken by the celebrity. There is a chat room, a store on which eBaum merchandise are put on sale and a section called &quot;Moron Mail&quot; featuring feedback sent in by users. The site also featured a message board, which existed until 2019. Bauman still operates a board created right after his termination by ZVUE. The forum was named sbaumsworld in tribute to Bauman&#x27;s history at the eBaum&#x27;s World.

== Copyright infringement and controversy ==
eBaum&#x27;s World has garnered controversy due to numerous incidents of content being taken from other sites (such as YTMND, Something Awful, Albino Blacksheep, 4chan, Olde English, Weebl&#x27;s Stuff, and Newgrounds) without attribution. Companies such as Viacom have claimed that eBaum&#x27;s World has infringed on their copyrights. The site denied critics&#x27; claims, citing research done by site editors and the consent form that must accompany uploads of material. eBaum&#x27;s World claimed to honor all requests to remove unauthorized material.

=== Timeline ===
* In 2003, Eric Bauman was threatened with legal action by corporations, citing unauthorized use of trademarked names or copyrighted material. One notable case involved the &quot;soundboards&quot; and the audio used within them.
* In January 2006, an animated image titled &quot;Lindsay Lohan Doesn&#x27;t Change Facial Expressions&quot; was lifted from YTMND.com and posted at eBaum&#x27;s World with the latter site&#x27;s watermark superimposed. The incident touched off a feud between the two sites, resulting in eBaum&#x27;s World removing the animation.
* On May 26, 2006, several images from the Something Awful forums were displayed on the eBaum&#x27;s World website. The images on eBaum&#x27;s World were cropped to remove the Something Awful watermark. The page was removed later in the day following multiple complaints being expressed on the eBaum&#x27;s World forums. As a result, Something Awful switched to a more invasive watermark template.
* On June 12, 2006, Steven Lerner of Albino Blacksheep explained that eBaum&#x27;s World took the popular Flash animation &quot;Animator vs. Animation&quot;, and the creator of the Flash animation, Alan Becker, would take legal action against eBaum&#x27;s World. Albino Blacksheep has also threatened legal action and claims that other websites have also asserted difficulties with Eric Bauman. Lerner and Becker used the MochiBot Flash tracking tool to track who used the animation on their web sites. Lerner also explained that the Flash animation is legally protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Furthermore, when the Flash animation was posted on eBaum&#x27;s World, it had been decompiled and the line &quot;Hosted on albinoblacksheep.com&quot; was removed. On June 9, Bauman sent Becker a $250 check as well as entering him into a monthly &quot;contest&quot; (of which Becker was the &quot;de facto&quot; winner) in hopes of having any legal charges dropped. Becker was also told to submit a pre-written statement claiming that none of eBaum&#x27;s World&#x27;s content was stolen, and that Bauman had contacted him prior to his content being posted on the site. Alan accepted this proposal, and later submitted this letter of apology to the Flash community of Albino Blacksheep:
: On June 26, 2006, eBaum&#x27;s World removed the animation and the apology from Becker from their web site.

* On July 9, 2006, eBaum&#x27;s World hosted an animation called &quot;Dumb Dinosaur&quot;, originally found on Albino Blacksheep and Spinnerdisc.com. They subsequently removed the animation, and issued this apologetic statement to Drew Mokris, creator of Dumb Dinosaur:
== On television ==
=== &quot;Right This Minute&quot; ===
eBaum&#x27;s World had a weekly segment on ABC-Disney&#x27;s &quot;Right This Minute&quot; called &quot;Real or Fake&quot; since July 2012. Each week longtime eBaum&#x27;s World editor MacDreidel brings three video clips that are viewed, discussed and ultimately voted on by the show&#x27;s hosts to determine if the video is a real viral video, or a staged fake.

=== Television series attempt ===
On January 24, 2006, USA Network made a deal with the Fox Television Studios to create a television program based on eBaum&#x27;s World. Producers described it as a late-night companion special to air with &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, featuring clips from the Web site, as well as new and exclusive content including interviews with former and current eBaum&#x27;s World subjects. The show was to feature former TechTV Host Martin Sargent of Unscrewed and professional wrestler Chris Jericho. The show was being executive produced by Simon Andreae through his production company, The Incubator, in association with Fox Television Studios. The cease and desist letters from this company were removed when this show was announced.

=== Web Soup ===
G4&#x27;s television show &quot;Web Soup&quot; partnered with eBaum&#x27;s World for its popular &quot;This Week in FAIL&quot; segment for its third-season run.

<doc id="1310893" wikidata="Q542757" url="?curid=1310893" title="Subaru XT">
<text>The Subaru XT is a two-door, front- or all-wheel drive, four passenger 2+2 coupé manufactured and marketed by Subaru for model years 1985-1991, with a facelift in 1987. At introduction, the XT was the most aerodynamic car marketed in the US market, heavily influenced by noted designer Alex Tremulis. 

Marketed as the Alcyone in Japan; as the Vortex in Australia and New Zealand; and as the XT (with the EA-82 four-cylinder engine) or XT6 (with the ER-27 six-cylinder engine) in North America and Europe, all XT&#x27;s were assembled at Subaru&#x27;s Yajima Plant in Ota, Japan. Over its single generation, production reached just over 98,000.

The XT was conceived in the United States for the US market, and debuted globally in the US. After sales began in February 1985 in the US, the XT Turbo 4WD&#x27;s debuted in Europe at the March 1985 Geneva Motor Show, followed by its Japanese debut in June 1985.

The XT was noted for its pronounced wedge shape, low coefficient of drag; aviation influences from the aircraft division of parent company Fuji Heavy Industry; and its host of features, either innovative or uncommon in the XT&#x27;s class — including height-adjustable pneumatic suspension, digital dash, central locking system, op-art upholstery, fold down rear seat, pod- and center console-mounted HVAC controls, advanced trip computer, and instrument cluster that tilted with adjustment of the steering column. With available front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, depending on the model year, the XT offered three trim levels, DL, GL (non-turbo, front-drive only), and GL-10 Turbo. 

The &quot;Alcyone&quot; nameplate derives from Alcyone, the brightest star in the Pleiades star cluster, stylized in the Subaru logo. The model was superseded by the Subaru Alcyone SVX in 1992.

==Design==

The XT featured a pronounced wedge shape, sharing a common &quot;folded paper&quot; design approach with the Type AA Subaru Leone. When introduced, the New York Times called it &quot;the ultimate in jazzy design&quot;, in contrast to Subaru&#x27;s other offerings. Though derived from earlier Subarus, it was less overtly practical or commodious. The 2.7-litre flat-six engine exceeded 2000 cc in the Japanese Domestic Market, thereby exceeding government engine displacement regulations, and incurring higher annual road tax.

===Aerodynamics===
Subaru&#x27;s trademark boxer engine with its flat, horizontally-opposed cylinder configuration, enabled the bodywork&#x27;s pronounced wedge shape, and extensive wind tunnel testing further lowered the XT&#x27;s coefficient of drag. Pop-up headlights contributed to the wedge shape, and rectractable button-like flaps allowed opening the door while keeping the handles flush with their adjacent bodywork. The XT used a single 22 inch windshield wiper which tucked under the hood when not in use, and rubber spoilers ahead of each wheel opening settled the airflow past the tires and wheels, while doubling as &quot;mud guards.&quot; The result was one of the most aerodynamic production cars of its time with a coefficient of drag of 0.29, improved fuel economy, and a quieter ride due to reduced wind noise.

===Features===
The XT&#x27;s interior used numerous aviation-like features, reflecting influences from the aircraft division of Subaru&#x27;s parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries. The instruments featured pod-mounted controls for lighting, HVAC and wipers. The instrument panel moved with the standard tilt-telescope steering to keep the instruments oriented to the driver, recalling the same feature on the Isuzu Piazza and the Ford Probe introduced earlier in the 1980s and the Porsche 928 in the late 1970s. The joystick-shaped shifter integrated a thumb trigger interlock for the &quot;on-demand&quot; four-wheel drive. Turbo models featured a quasi-artificial horizon orange backlit liquid crystal instrument display with the tachometer, boost indicator, temperature and fuel gauges seen as three-dimensional graphs oriented to the quasi-horizon. 

The XT featured a turbocharger, computer-controlled engine and transmission, adjustable height suspension and an optional digital instrument cluster. The pneumatic with height control recalled the use of Hydropneumatic suspension by Citroën, and Mercedes-Benz. Other uncommon features included an electronic in-dash trip computer, headlight washers (XT6 only), alloy wheels featuring an inset rectangular shape, pass-through folding rear seats, racing style front seats and available push-button four-wheel drive (later changed to all-wheel drive).

The XT featured a speed alarm at 55mph, that could be activated with a separate key.

== 1985–1987 (Pre-facelift) ==
The XT was launched initially as the XT in North America, Alcyone in Japan and Vortex in Australia and New Zealand. The pre-facelift XT was only powered by an H4 and was produced from 1985 to 1987.

=== Drivetrain ===
The 1985 XT was fitted with one of two engines:
* EA-82: 1781 cc H4 producing 97 hp (72 kW) at 5200 rpm and 103 ft·lbf (140 Nm) at 3200 rpm (9.5:1 compression ratio).
* EA-82T: 1781 cc turbocharged H4 producing 112 hp (83 kW) at 4800 rpm and 143 ft·lbf (194 Nm) at 2800 rpm (7.5:1 compression ratio; some sources say 7.7:1.) in North American specifications. In Europe the power of the XT Turbo was at 5600 rpm and at 2800 rpm; the naturally aspirated model was not sold there. Starting in 1987, power for North American cars increased to .

These engines shared the following equipment and specifications:
* displacement (92×67mm/3.62×2.63&quot;)
* Multi-port fuel injection
* Single overhead camshafts

The XT was available with both manual and automatic transmissions. 85-87 XT Turbos were available as either front-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive, while the 85-87 XT non turbo cars were only available as front-wheel-drive. The part-time four-wheel-drive system, titled &quot;On-Demand&quot;, was selectable by a push button atop the shifter.

=== Markets ===
Like other Subaru models of the same vintage, the North American market XT was sold in four models: the base-model XT DL, the better-equipped XT GL, the top-of-the-range FWD XT GL-10 Turbo and 4WD XT GL-10 Turbo-Traction. Many of the options mentioned above were available only on the GL-10 models. 

In Japan it was only available as 2 turbocharged models: the Alcyone 4WD VR Turbo, and the Alcyone FF VS Turbo.

Australia and New Zealand also got 2 models, the turbocharged Vortex Turbo and the non-turbocharged Vortex XT. Initially the Vortex was only available as the non-turbocharged manual Vortex XT, but the turbo version and automatic gearbox came the following year.

European markets generally only received the XT Turbo and the XT Turbo 4WD (XT Turbo Allrad in Germany), where the car was sold in small numbers as a halo model.

=== Models ===
== 1987–1991 (Facelift &amp; XT6) ==

The XT received a minor update in 1987 for the second half of the 1987 model year roughly corresponding to the 1988 launch of the XT6, a new 6 cylinder model. Where earlier models featured bumper-mounted reverse lights, 1987-up models had the reverse lights in the center taillight panel. The front and rear bumpers were also redesigned. In Japan, the original bumpers were used for the VS and VR while the VX received the new facelift. In the US, all new models received the facelifted bumpers.

All wheel drive turbo and six-cylinder models were distinguished by their headrests; base models had solid headrests, where the turbo AWD and six-cylinder models had a large rectangular hole through the center.

=== Drivetrain ===
The 1987 XT was fitted with one of 3 engines

* EA-82: 1781 cc H4 producing 97 hp (72 kW) at 5200 rpm and 103 ft·lbf (140 Nm) at 3200 rpm (9.5:1 compression ratio).
* EA-82T: 1781 cc turbocharged H4 producing 115 hp (86 kW) at 4800 rpm and 143 ft·lbf (194 Nm) at 2800 rpm (7.5:1 compression ratio; some sources say 7.7:1.).
* ER-27: 2672 cc H6 producing at 5,200 rpm and at 4,000 rpm.

6 cylinder models were fitted with stiffer suspension to compensate for the new heavier engine.

=== Markets ===
In North America the updated XT was sold in 2 models: The base 4 cylinder model GL, and the new 6 cylinder model XT6. The turbo models were dropped from the North American market after the update.

In Japan, the updated XT was sold in 3 models: The turbocharged FWD VS, the turbocharged 4WD VR, and the new 6 cylinder 4WD Alcyone VX. 

In New Zealand, the new 6 cylinder model was marketed as the Vortex ZZ6. However, virtually none were sold due to New Zealand&#x27;s fuel options were 91 octane unleaded fuel or 96 octane leaded fuel while the ER27 required 96 octane unleaded petrol. There are only two NZ new 6 cylinder Vortex&#x27;s left registered today according to NZTA fleet data.

In Japan, the part-time 4WD system was replaced entirely by the new full-time 4WD system. In the US, the XT6 was available in either FWD or with the new full-time 4WD system while the XT GL was available with either FWD or the old &quot;On-Demand&quot; 4WD.

=== Features and options ===

The XT6 was fitted with a unique Cybrid adaptive electrohydraulic steering system that changed the level of assistance based on the vehicle&#x27;s speed. This system did not use a conventional belt-driven power steering pump, freeing up much-needed space in the XT6&#x27;s already cramped engine bay. The Cybrid system also uses hydraulic fluid that is incompatible with conventional power steering fluid (which is usually automatic transmission fluid). This fluid is still available directly from Subaru at a significant premium over more common types of hydraulic fluid.

The XT6 has two electric fans to also help performance, compared to one electric fan and one belt driven fan on all other XTs. With these changes, the XT6 was given a higher amp alternator.

The XT6 was not available with the digital instrument cluster of the turbo XT models.

=== Special editions ===
A special &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; version of the Alcyone VX was produced in 1988, limited to 30 units. This version had a white and gold paint job with &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; side decals and a red interior.

2 prototype versions of the Alcyone VX were made in Japan for the 27th Tokyo Motor Show. The &quot;Junko Shimada&quot; was one that included a full black paintjob with black smooth wheel caps and a bright red leather interior, designed by Japanese fashion designer, Junko Shimada. The other was the &quot;FICCE Special&quot; which was a convertible version of the Alcyone with special hubcaps and interior graphics designed by Yoshiyuki Konishi. The FICCE is allegedly sitting in the Ibaraki Prefecture in need of restoration.

==Market appeal and production==

Overall production of the XT remained low throughout its lifespan. Although the fuel crisis of the late 1970s and ever-tightening emissions regulations had severely limited power figures from all manufacturers in the mid 1980s, the XT&#x27;s paltry wasn&#x27;t enough to attract serious attention from the automotive racing crowd. One of Subaru&#x27;s ads from the 1980s read, &quot;The kind of car Mercedes might have built if they were a little more frugal and a lot more inventive.&quot; The car&#x27;s extra features, which certainly had some novelty appeal, were uncharacteristic of this class of car and may not have contributed much to the XT&#x27;s sales. In the 1980s, consumers with surplus cash in search of a better-equipped vehicle did not generally start shopping at Subaru.

Subaru produced 98,918 XTs, XT6s, and Alcyone&#x27;s. Surprisingly, only 8,170 of these were sold in the Japanese market.

While the XT was an interesting design exercise, it did little to grow Subaru&#x27;s sales. The company has seen much more widespread success in the significantly more mainstream Legacy, Legacy Outback and Impreza WRX models introduced in recent years.

The Subaru XT Turbo was the official car for the Most Valuable Player for Super Bowl XXII presented by &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine in 1988, eventually won by Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams, and The Subaru XT6 was the official car for the Most Valuable Player for Super Bowl XXIII in 1989, eventually won by San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice.

== Motorsports ==
The XT was almost never officially used for racing. One exception is the 1985 Wynn&#x27;s Safari Australia where one XT competed, however it received damage and was not able to finish.
