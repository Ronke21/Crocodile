<text>Swami Bhuteshananda was born on 8 September 1901 at Somsar (an interior village) in Bengal Presidency. His premonastic name was Vijay Chandra. His father was Purna Chandra Roy and his mother Charubala Devi. In his student life, he met Jnan Maharaj (a direct disciple of Swami Vivekananda). Under influence of his and some other spiritual young boys, he started to go to Belur Math frequently and he met many of the direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He graduated from Government Sanskrit College (Kolkata, then Calcutta) where he mastered Bengali, English and Sanskrit. Due to his visits to the Math, one day he went to the Math to become Monk (Sannyasi), but as his studies was not completed, he was asked to come later. This made him leave his residence and he built a Shiva temple in Baghbazar (Calcutta) and lived there like a renunciate monk, practicing intense Tapasya. He was present during the funeral of Sri Sarada Devi, in December 1920.

In 1921 Saradananda (direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna) initiated Vijay with Mantradiksha at the Mother&#x27;s house. He was bestowed with the vows of Brahmacharya by Shivananda in 1923 on Holy mother&#x27;s birthday, and was named &#x27;Priya Chaitanya&#x27;. He took Sannyasa from Swami Shivananda (another direct disciple of Sri Ramamkrishna). Swami Gambhirananda was also initiated into Brahmacharya in 1923 and into Sannyasa in 1928 by Swami Shivananda. After he became a monk, he went to Uttarkashi (Himalayas) and lived in the Himalayas for 2–3 years like a traditional monk, wandering without any fixed residence, practicing Tapasya (Spiritual Austerities) and living by Bhiksha (Begging food). After return he went to Dhaka Center (of Ramakrishna Order) till 1932.

In 1936, he was appointed the president of the Ramakrishna Math, Shillong. In 1945, he was appointed as the president of Rajkot Math. There he translated Ramakrishna-Vivekananda-Vedanta literature into Gujarati, and served in the relief operations organized by the Order in the flooded areas of West Bengal in 1926, as the Camp-in-charge of the Burma Evacuee Relief in 1942 and many others. In 1965, Bhuteshanandaji was appointed as one of the Trustees and a Member of the Governing body of Ramakrishna Mission. In 1975, Bhuteshanandaji became one of the vice-presidents of the Order and moved over to Kankurgachi Yogodyan, a suburb of Kolkata. Following the death of Gambhirananda (27 December 1988), the 11th president of the Order, in 1989 (24 January), he became the 12th president. From 1975 to 1998, he initiated many. he never wrote any books, but his explanation and classes on spiritual texts like the Upanishads, Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita (English: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna), Bhagavatam, etc. have been recorded by others who were present there. Some books have been published from his lectures and class talks, of which &quot;Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita Prasanga&quot; (in six vols.), &quot;Mundakopanishad, Kathopanishad, Upanishad&quot; O &quot;Ajker Manush, Sharanagati&quot; (all in Bengali) and &quot;Thoughts on Spiritual Life&quot; (in English).

During twenty-three years as vice president and President of the Order he travelled to many countries including Singapore, Fiji, Japan, Australia, America, Canada, England, France, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and carried the ideals and ideas of Ramakrishna-Mother-Vivekananda to innumerable people. He had a special fascination for Vedānta- Advaita Vedānta.

He died on 10 August 1998.
On 18 December 2015, a new temple and monastery were inaugurated at Somsar, his ancestral village in Bankura district.

<doc id="1322490" wikidata="Q4470396" url="?curid=1322490" title="Ukraine without Kuchma">
<text>Ukraine without Kuchma (; &quot;Ukrayina bez Kuchmy&quot;, Russian: Украина без Кучмы, UBK) was a mass protest campaign that took place in Ukraine in 2000–2001, demanding the resignation of President Leonid Kuchma, and preceding the Orange Revolution. Unlike the Orange Revolution, Ukraine without Kuchma was effectively extinguished by the government enforcement units, and followed by numerous arrests of the opposition and the Ukrainian-speaking participants. Seeking the criminal responsibility for those events was renewed with the election of Viktor Yanukovych as the President of Ukraine.

&quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot; was organized by the political opposition, influenced by the infamous Cassette Scandal, presidential elections of 1999, and aimed mainly to demand the resignation of the newly re-elected President Kuchma. The protests did not disappear untraced and resulted in consolidation of the democratic opposition which led to the Orange Revolution.

==Beginning of the protests==
The first and barely noticed action of the campaign took place on 15 December 2000 on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (&quot;Independence Square&quot;), the main plaza of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. The protesters sought Kuchma&#x27;s stepping down and proper investigations of the disappearance of journalist Georgiy Gongadze.

==Growth of political support==
Soon, the initiative grew into a mass campaign widely supported by students and opposition activists. The opposition parties, having lost the 1999 Ukrainian presidential election shortly before the scandal, considered the campaign as a natural reason for unification and reinforcement. The protests were organized as a network coalition and guided by collective leadership. However, Yulia Tymoshenko (at the time leading the National Salvation Committee), Yuriy Lutsenko (at that time representing the Socialist Party of Ukraine) and independent Volodymyr Chemerys became prominent leaders of the action. More than a dozen political parties supported the campaign, among them Socialists, the influential right-centrist People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (both represented in Ukraine&#x27;s parliament, Verkhovna Rada), extreme-right UNA-UNSO and others. The leaders put aside the political differences between such mutually antagonistic groups and concentrated on anti-authoritarian protest and demands for political freedom. They also united in acceptance of broad Western support for the campaign.

==Mass phase of the protests==
Students and youth constituted the majority of participants, although the campaign gained wide public support. Protesters set up a makeshift tent encampment on the sidewalks of the plaza and neighbouring Khreschatyk Street. Active supporters were living or taking shifts in the tents, while many others occasionally visited the rallies. Discotheques and concerts of liberal-oriented musicians were organized on the plaza. Student strikes took place at some universities. Lviv and some other cities joined the campaign, but to a lesser extent.

==Authorities&#x27; efforts to tackle the protests==
Frightened by the scale and unusual tactics of the campaign, the authorities repeatedly tried to destroy the camp using police and masked provocateurs, but avoided mass clashes. Trying to stop the protests, Kyiv&#x27;s mayor Oleksandr Omelchenko ordered a major reconstruction of the plaza, fencing most of it off. This prevented the protesters from gathering large crowds, but barely affected the campaign. Authorities in some other cities adopted the tactic, announcing &quot;construction work&quot; on their main squares, usually with no activity behind the newly installed fences.

==Controversial political impact on Cabinet==
Lacking general unity and forming a minority in the Verkhovna Rada, opposition politicians could provide protesters with only limited support, such as initiating a mock impeachment of Kuchma and making parliamentary protest. Pro-Western liberals were constrained in actions since they were backing up Kuchma&#x27;s Prime Minister, highly-popular reformist Viktor Yushchenko, in his efforts to oppose pro-President oligarchs. The campaigners called on him to support their demands and take the lead. But Yushchenko refused, instead co-signing a highly critical public address with together with Kuchma. Some influential media became biased in favor of the authorities.

Leonid Kuchma received three leaders of the campaign, heard out their daring accusations and demands, but refused to satisfy any. According to Volodymyr Chemerys, the President claimed that he would sack the police Minister Kravchenko (accused in Gongadze&#x27;s abduction), as protesters demanded, if only Yushchenko suggested this dismissal officially as Prime Minister - which never happened.

==March 2001 events and violent ending==

Occasional mass demonstrations were organized in front of government buildings. The organizers claimed a strategy of non-violent resistance but failed to sustain it. On 9 March 2001, the birthday of Taras Shevchenko, there were few clashes between protesters and riot police, and dozens were injured: arguably the most violent and populous riots in Ukraine&#x27;s modern history at the time. Both sides of the incident blamed the other. Protest leaders argued that police provoked the last and most violent clash near the presidential palace, by blocking a procession and infiltrating it with provocateurs. Indeed, militarized right-wing extremists led the fight. In response, authorities conducted mass arrests in the city, focussing on Ukrainian-speaking youth. Several opposition MPs took advantage of their parliamentary immunity by storming police stations and cars in efforts to release the apprehended.

The public impression of the incident led to a gradual decrease of support for the campaign. Soon, it was declared finished. A group of active participants of the March 9 clashes was convicted and imprisoned.

==Long-term effects==
Later that year, Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko was sacked by President Kuchma and joined the opposition. In 2002 parliamentary election, he led the Our Ukraine (&quot;Nasha Ukraina&quot;) electoral coalition that won the vote, but failed to form a majority in the Verkhovna Rada. Many protests leaders were united in that coalition, while others participated in the Socialist Party and Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc (the successor of the National Salvation Committee), which later became the political allies of Our Ukraine.

Yushchenko&#x27;s campaign in the 2004 presidential election was significantly influenced by the slogans, tactics and general spirit of Ukraine without Kuchma. The Orange Revolution, provoked by massive electoral fraud during the vote, happened in a manner very similar to 2001 campaign and was led mainly by the same politicians and activists.

After becoming the President, Yushchenko appointed Yuriy Lutsenko, one of the leaders of campaign, Minister of the Internal Affairs (i.e. the chief of the militsiya) and Yulia Tymoshenko was appointed Prime Minister

==TV coverage==
The main events and general trends of Ukraine without Kuchma campaign are studied in &quot;The Face of Protest&quot; TV documentary () made in 2003 by Andriy Shevchenko. The film is based on the various TV footages of the protests and interviews of the participants on both sides (from campaign leaders to militsioners).

<doc id="1322493" wikidata="Q6961878" url="?curid=1322493" title="Naming of British railway rolling stock">
<text>Since the invention of the very first railway steam locomotive in 1804, railway companies have applied names to their locomotives, carriages and multiple units. Numbers have usually been applied too, but not always; the Great Western Railway only applied names to its own broad gauge locomotives (though numbers were given to such locomotives that it inherited from elsewhere).

Locomotive names have been inspired by a variety of topics over the two centuries of railway operation in the United Kingdom, and the principal themes are set out in the table below, together with some examples of locomotive classes where all or a large proportion carried such names. Two other types of thematic naming of locomotive classes have occurred:
* Each name, though drawn from a variety of different people and things, was strongly connected to the locality through which the owning railway operated. For example the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s electric locomotives built in the 1920s carried the names of famous and fictional Londoners of varying types.
* Each name commenced with the same word or letters. For example, British Rail&#x27;s Class 52 engines each carried a two-word name, the first of which was &quot;Western&quot;, Foster Yeoman&#x27;s Class 59 engines similarly had &quot;Yeoman&quot; as the first word, and the Class 47 engines operated by Rail Express Systems had names commencing with the letters &quot;Res&quot;.

<text>Banking in [[Australia]] is dominated by four major banks: Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank. There are several smaller banks with a presence throughout the country which includes Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Suncorp Bank, and a large number of other financial institutions, such as credit unions, building societies and mutual banks, which provide limited banking-type services and are described as authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs). Many large foreign banks have a presence, but few have a retail banking presence. The central bank is the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The Australian government’s Financial Claims Scheme guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per account-holder per ADI in the event of the ADI failing.

Banks require a bank licence under the &quot;Banking Act 1959&quot;. Foreign banks require a licence to operate through a branch in Australia, as do Australian-incorporated foreign bank subsidiaries. Complying religious charitable development funds are exempt from the banking licence requirement.

Australia has a sophisticated, competitive and profitable financial sector and a strong regulatory system. For the 10 years ended mid-2013, the Commonwealth Bank was ranked first in Bloomberg Riskless Return Ranking a risk-adjusted 18%. Westpac Bank was in fourth place with 11% and ANZ Bank was in seventh place with 8.7%. The four major banks are among the world&#x27;s largest banks by market capitalisation and all rank in the top 25 globally for safest banks. They are also some of the most profitable in the world. Australia&#x27;s financial services sector is the largest contributor to the national economy, contributing around $140 billion to GDP a year. It is a major driver of economic growth and employs 450,000 people.

== Financial institutions ==
Deregulation of the financial sector commenced in the mid-1960s, with the removal of the distinction between and separation of trading and savings banks. Building societies were allowed to take deposits from the public. Banking in Australia is notable by the small number of large banks in the market. Much of this concentration is the result of bank acquisitions. English, Scottish and Australian Bank was acquired by the ANZ Bank in 1970. In 1982, the Bank of New South Wales merged with the Commercial Bank of Australia to form Westpac. There were many other bank mergers and acquisitions throughout Australia&#x27;s banking history. Beginning in the 1980s, several building societies sought to convert to banks, but were required to demutualise before they were permitted to do so. This included NSW Building Society, which became Advance Bank, St George, Suncorp, Metway Bank, Challenge Bank, Bank of Melbourne and Bendigo Bank. A change in regulations allowed building societies and credit unions to become banks without having to demutualise, and several including Heritage Bank have converted since 2011 while retaining their status and structure as mutual organisations.

=== Big four banks ===

In 1990, the government adopted a &quot;four pillars policy&quot; in relation to banking in Australia and announced that it would reject any mergers between the big four banks. This is long-standing policy rather than formal regulation, but it reflects the broad political unpopularity of further bank mergers. A number of commentators have argued that the &quot;four pillars policy&quot; is built upon economic fallacies and works against Australia&#x27;s better interests.

The four pillars policy does not prevent the four major banks from acquiring smaller competitors. In 2000, CBA acquired the Colonial Group, which had emerged as a major bank–insurance combine in the 1990s, after the Colonial Mutual insurance group took over State Bank of New South Wales in 1994. The Commonwealth Bank also acquired the State Bank of Victoria in 1990 and Bankwest in 2008. Westpac acquired Challenge Bank in 1995, Bank of Melbourne in 1997, and St George Bank in 2008.

Currently, banking in Australia is dominated by four major banks: Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ Bank and the National Australia Bank. The top four banking groups in Australia ranked by market capitalisation at share price 1 December 2017:

=== Mutual banking in Australia ===
The Customer Owned Banking Association (formerly known as Abacus Australian Mutuals) is the industry body representing the more than 100 credit unions, building societies and mutual banks that constitute the Australian mutual or cooperative banking sector.

Collectively, Australian customer-owned banks service 4.6 million customers or &#x27;members&#x27; (as they are mutual shareholders in the institutions), with total assets of over A$138 billion. The ten largest customer-owned banks in Australia are:

Great Southern Bank is Australia&#x27;s largest customer owned bank having achieved this status with the rebranding from Credit Union Australia on 1 June 2021. Previously Heritage Bank was Australia&#x27;s largest customer-owned bank, having changed its name from Heritage Building Society in December 2011. A number of credit unions and building societies changed their business names to include the word &#x27;bank&#x27;, to overcome adverse perceptions of smaller deposit-taking entities. For example, in September 2011 Bank Australia (formerly Bankmecu) was announced as Australia&#x27;s first customer-owned bank.

Three teachers&#x27; credit unions have become known as &#x27;banks&#x27;; namely, RACQ Bank (formerly the Queensland Teachers&#x27; Credit Union), Bank First (formerly the Victoria Teachers&#x27; Credit Union), and Teachers Mutual Bank (formerly Teachers Credit Union). The Police &amp; Nurses&#x27; Credit Union began trading as P&amp;N Bank in March 2013, and some credit unions are electing to use &#x27;mutual banking&#x27; as a business tagline, rather than as a business name, as they do not meet the criteria to be called a &#x27;bank&#x27;.

Top 10 Total Assets (2019-2023)

* Heritage &amp; People&#x27;s Choice (following the merger of People&#x27;s Choice Credit Union and Heritage Bank)
* Newcastle Greater Mutual Group (following the merger of Newcastle Permanent and Greater Bank)
* Great Southern Bank (previous CUA, Credit Union Australia)
* Teachers Mutual Bank
* Bank Australia
* P&amp;N Bank
* IMB Bank
* Quodos Bank
* Bank First

=== Other retail banks ===
There are other retail banks in Australia. These are smaller and often regional banks, including the Bendigo &amp; Adelaide Bank, Suncorp Bank, the Bank of Queensland (including its retail arms ME Bank &amp; Virgin Money. Other banks, such as Bankwest, St George Bank and Bank of Melbourne, are subsidiaries or alternate trading names of the big four banks. Bankwest (CBA), Bank of Melbourne, St George and BankSA are all trading names of Westpac.

=== Foreign banks ===
Foreign banks wishing to carry on a banking business in Australia must obtain a banking authority issued by APRA under the &quot;Banking Act&quot;, either to operate as a wholesale bank through an Australian branch or to conduct business through an Australian-incorporated subsidiary. Foreign banks engaging in retail banking require a full banking licence. Foreign banks which do not wish to obtain a banking authority in Australia may operate a representative office in Australia for liaison purposes, but the activities of that office will be restricted.

According to the Foreign Investment Review Board, foreign investment in the Australian banking sector needs to be consistent with the &quot;Banking Act&quot;, the &quot;Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998&quot; and banking policy, including prudential requirements. Any proposed foreign takeover or acquisition of an Australian bank will be considered on a case-by-case basis and judged on its merits.

There are a number of foreign subsidiary banks, however only a few have a retail banking presence; ING Bank (Australia) Limited (trading as ING), HSBC Bank Australia (a subsidiary of HSBC), Delphi Bank (formerly the &#x27;Bank of Cyprus Australia&#x27;, and in 2012 acquired by Bendigo &amp; Adelaide Bank), Bank of Sydney (with a full banking licence since 2001) have a small number of branches.

Foreign banks have a more significant presence in the Australian merchant banking sector.

== Regulation ==

Formally, there is extensive and detailed regulation of Australia&#x27;s banking system, split mainly between the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC). The Reserve Bank of Australia also has an important involvement. However, in practice, banks in Australia are self-regulated through external dispute resolution (EDR) schemes, the most prominent of which is the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).

APRA is responsible for the licensing and prudential supervision of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) (banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies and participants in certain credit card schemes and certain purchaser payment facilities), as well as life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds. APRA issues capital adequacy guidelines for banks which are consistent with the Basel II guidelines. All financial institutions regulated by APRA are required to report on a periodic basis to APRA. Certain financial intermediaries, such as investment banks (which do not otherwise operate as ADIs) are neither licensed nor regulated under the &quot;Banking Act&quot; and are not subject to the prudential supervision of APRA. They may be required to obtain licences under the &quot;Corporations Act&quot; 2001 or other Commonwealth or State legislation, depending on the nature of their business activities in Australia.

ASIC has responsibility for market integrity and consumer protection and the regulation of certain financial institutions (including investment banks and finance companies). However, ASIC does not actually investigate any issues or propose any regulations that concern consumer protection, this authority is delegated to the EDR schemes and the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC). The front face of the regulation of financial institutions and financial advisers are the various EDR schemes, the most popular of which is AFCA. ASIC is responsible for the approval of EDR schemes, all of which must comply with ASIC Regulatory Guide 139.

Banks are also subject to obligations under the &quot;Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006&quot; as &quot;reporting entities&quot;. They are required to identify and monitor customers using a risk-based approach, develop and maintain a compliance program, and report to Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre certain cash transactions as well as suspicious matters and file annual compliance reports.

There have been calls in recent times for an added level of regulation of banks following lending, foreign exchange, and financial planning controversies between 2009 and 2017, highlighted in 2016 Senate inquiries. Referring to white collar crime, ASIC&#x27;s Chairman Greg Medcraft said &#x27;This is a bit of paradise, Australia, for white collar [crime]&#x27;. In December 2017 the Australian Government established the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry to inquire into and report on misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. The interim report from the Royal Commission prompted the industry to revamp its banking code. The code has been criticised as needing to be legally binding, strictly liable and breaches criminal.

==Interbank lending market==

During the course of every day, each bank executes a large number of transactions, such as payroll, retail and business purchases, credit card payments, etc. Some involve cash (or its equivalent) coming into the bank and others of cash going out. Banks do not have a reliable way of predicting what or how much those transactions will be. At the end of each day banks must reconcile their positions. The bank that finds itself with a surplus of cash would miss out earning interest on the cash, even if it&#x27;s for only one night. Other banks may find that they had more money going out than coming in, and the bank must borrow cash to cover the shortfall. To meet its liquidity obligations, the bank with the shortfall would borrow from a bank with a surplus in the interbank lending market. Depending on the bank&#x27;s assessment of the type of shortfall and costs, the bank may take out an overnight loan, the interest rate of which is based on the cash rate, which is set by the Reserve Bank (RBA) every month (currently 0.10%); or else take out a &quot;short duration loan&quot;, known as &quot;prime bank paper&quot;, for a term of between one and six months and whose interest rate is called the &quot;bank bill swap rate&quot; (BBSW), which is set by the commercial banks.

Until July 2017 a body called the Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA) determined the BBSW rate. Since July 2017 the ASX calculates the rate. Until 2013, AFMA would every morning at 10am ask each of the &quot;prime banks&quot; what interest rates they will be offering or asking for that day. AFMA would then calculate the BBSW rate as the average of those quotes. Normally, the longer the term, the higher the offered rate. The system required some level of subjective judgement by the banks, because there was a rapidly changing market on multiple broker screens. AFMA changed the method of calculating the BBSW rate to be based on a multimarket electronic feed of live bids and offers. ASX would later add the use of market transactions in addition to these live bids and offers. Besides affecting the BBSW rate, many other financial rates are based on it. The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) monitors the BBSW system.

There arises from time to time a situation when there are insufficient funds in the interbank lending market to enable the banks to balance their books. Some banks, for example, may be experiencing a bank run or may be withholding funds from the market expecting a heightened demand in the near future. The Reserve Bank&#x27;s role includes ensuring liquidity in the banking system, including acting as lender of last resort in times of a liquidity crisis.

==International cooperation ==
The United States has enacted the &quot;Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. &quot; (FATCA) which came into effect on 1 July 2014, which aims to prevent tax evasion by US tax residents who hold foreign accounts by requiring foreign financial institutions to report details and interest income to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Australia has signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States which sets out rules to enable Australian financial institutions to report to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) which in turn passes the information to the IRS. FATCA affects US citizens, US tax residents and certain types of organisations that are controlled by them. To comply with FATCA, Australian banks ask customers to declare their US tax status.

== History ==
===Early history===

Between white settlement in Sydney in 1788 and 1817, there were no banks nor much currency in the colony. The first bank in Australia was the Bank of New South Wales, established in Sydney in 1817. During the 19th and early 20th century, the Bank of New South Wales opened branches throughout Australia and Oceania: at Moreton Bay (Brisbane) (in 1850), then in Victoria (1851), New Zealand (1861), South Australia (1877), Western Australia (1883), Fiji (1901), Papua (now part of Papua New Guinea) (1910) and Tasmania (1910). It was by far the most dominant bank throughout Australia until into the 1960s. 

The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney was established in 1834, and the National Bank of Australasia established in Melbourne in 1858, and set up branches in other Australian colonies: Tasmania (in 1859), Western Australia (1866), New South Wales (1885) and Queensland (1920), and a London branch (1864). After acquiring a number of other banks over the years, these two banks merged in 1982 to form the National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia, which was renamed the National Australia Bank.

In 1835 a London-based bank called the Bank of Australasia was formed that would eventually become the ANZ Bank. In 1951, it merged with the Union Bank of Australia, another London-based bank, which had been formed in 1837. In 1970, it merged with the English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited, another London-based bank, formed in 1852, in what was then the largest merger in Australian banking history, to form the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited.

A speculative boom in the Australian property market in the 1880s led to the Australian banking crisis of 1893. This was in an environment where little government control or regulation of banks had been established and led to the failure of 11 commercial banks, even the National Bank of Australasia.

Until 1910, banks could issue private bank notes, except in Queensland which issued treasury notes (1866–1869) and banknotes (1893–1910) which were legal tender in Queensland. Private bank notes were not legal tender except for a brief period in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue or other provisions for the protection of the public. Queensland treasury notes were legal tender in that state.

===After federation ===
Private bank notes and treasury notes continued in circulation until 1910, when the federal Parliament passed the &quot;Australian Notes Act 1910&quot; which prohibited the circulation of state notes as money and the &quot;Bank Notes Tax Act 1910&quot; imposed a prohibitive tax of 10% per annum on &#x27;all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth ... and not redeemed&#x27;. These Acts put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. Also in 1910, the Australian pound was first issued as the legal tender in Australia. Now, the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; expressly prohibits persons from issuing bills or notes payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation.

The federal government established the Commonwealth Bank in 1911, which by 1913 had branches in all six states. In 1912, it took over the State Savings Bank of Tasmania (est. 1902) and did the same in 1920 with the Queensland Government Savings Bank (est. 1861). As with many other countries, the Great Depression of the 1930s brought a string of bank failures. In 1931, Commonwealth Bank took over two faltering state savings banks: the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales (est. 1871) and the State Savings Bank of Western Australia (est. 1863). In 1991, it also took over the failing State Bank of Victoria (est. 1842).

As a response to the Great Depression, banking in Australia became tightly regulated. Until the 1980s, it was virtually impossible for a foreign bank to establish branches in Australia; with the consequence that Australia had fewer banks compared to countries such as the United States and Hong Kong. Moreover, banks in Australia were classified as either &quot;savings banks&quot; or &quot;trading banks&quot;. Savings banks paid virtually no interest to their depositors and their lending activities were restricted to providing mortgages. Many of these savings banks were owned by state governments. Trading banks were essentially merchant banks, which did not provide services to the general public. Because of these and numerous other regulatory restrictions, other forms of non-bank financial institutions flourished in Australia, such as building societies and credit unions. These were regulated by state laws and were subject to less stringent regulations, could provide and charge higher interest rates, but were restricted in the range of services they could offer. Above all, they were not allowed to call themselves &quot;banks&quot;.
From 1920, the Commonwealth Bank performed some central bank functions, which were greatly expanded during World War II. This arrangement caused some discomfort for the other banks, and as a result the Reserve Bank of Australia was created on 14 January 1960 and assumed the central bank functions previously performed by the Commonwealth Bank, including managing the currency, the money supply and exchange control.

===Adoption of new technology===
Banks have adopted new technologies in order to reduce operating costs. The rollout of automated teller machines (ATMs) commenced in 1969. There are currently a number of ATM networks operating in Australia, the largest five of which are: the Commonwealth Bank-Bankwest network (with over 4,000 machines), NAB-rediATM network (with over 3,400 machines), Westpac-St George-BankSA and Bank of Melbourne network (with over 3,000 machines), ANZ (with over 2,600 machines) and Suncorp (with over 2,000 machines), and others. Financial institutions are linked via interbank networks.

The use of the Bank State Branch (BSB) identifier was introduced in the early 1970s with the introduction of MICR on cheques to mechanise the process of data capture by the banks as well as for mechanical sorting and bundling of physical cheques for forwarding to the payer bank branch for final cheque clearance. Since then, BSBs have been used in electronic transactions (but is not used in financial card numbering).

EFTPOS technology was introduced in 1984. Initially, only the banks&#x27; existing debit and credit cards could be used, but in 1985, the ATM (Financial) Network was created to link EFTPOS systems to provide access for all customers. Cards issued by all banks could then be used at all EFTPOS terminals nationally, but debit cards issued in other countries could not. Prior to 1986, the Australian banks organized a widespread uniform credit card, called Bankcard, which had been in existence since 1974. There was a dispute between the banks whether Bankcard (or credit cards in general) should be permitted into the proposed EFTPOS system. At that time several banks were actively promoting MasterCard and Visa credit cards. Store cards and proprietary cards, such as fuel cards and Bartercard, were shut out of the new system, though they use compatible technology.

The widespread acceptance of credit cards and the development of SSL encrypted technology in mid 1990s opened the way to E-commerce. Telephone banking was introduced in the 1990s, with internet banking being introduced after 1995 and mobile banking after the 2010s. Bain, Research Now and Bain along with GMI NPS surveys in 2012 found that 27% of Australians have had mobile banking transactions in the previous three months. These innovations have resulted in significant shifts in banking in Australia away from the use of bank branches, and resulting in branch closures and staff cuts.

===Deregulation and concentration ===
The banking industry was slowly deregulated. In the mid-1960s, the distinction between and separation of trading and savings banks was removed and all banks were allowed to operate in the money market (traditionally the domain of merchant banks), and banks were allowed to set their own interest rates. Building societies were allowed to take deposits from the public. Foreign exchange controls were abolished and the Australian dollar was permitted to float from December 1983.

Banking in Australia is notable by the small number of large banks in the market. Much of this concentration is the result of bank acquisitions. English, Scottish and Australian Bank was acquired by the ANZ Bank in 1970. In 1982, Bank of New South Wales merged with the Commercial Bank of Australia to form Westpac. There were many other bank mergers and acquisitions throughout Australia&#x27;s banking history. The boom and bust of the 1980s was a turbulent period for banks, with some establishing leading market positions, while others being absorbed by the larger banks. Beginning in the 1980s, several building societies sought to convert to banks, but were required to demutualise before they were permitted to do so. This included NSW Building Society, which became Advance Bank, St George, Suncorp, Metway Bank, Challenge Bank, Bank of Melbourne and Bendigo Bank. A change in regulations allowed building societies and credit unions to become banks without having to demutualise, and several including Heritage Bank have converted since 2011 while retaining their status and structure as mutual organisations.

In 1990, the government adopted the &quot;four pillars policy&quot; in relation to banking in Australia and announced that it would reject any mergers between the four big banks. The four pillars policy, however, has not prevented the four major banks from acquiring smaller competitors. In 2000, CBA acquired the Colonial group, which had emerged as a major bank–insurance combine in the 1990s, after the Colonial Mutual insurance group took over State Bank of NSW in 1994. The Commonwealth Bank also acquired the State Bank of Victoria in 1990 and Bankwest in 2008. Westpac acquired the Challenge Bank in 1995, Bank of Melbourne in 1997, and St George Bank in 2008.

The Australian government&#x27;s direct ownership of banks ceased with the full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank between 1991 and 1996. There was also increased competition from non-bank lenders, such as providers of securitised home loans. A category of authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) was created for a corporation which is authorised under the &quot;Banking Act 1959&quot; to take deposits from customers. The change formalised the right of non-bank financial institutions – such as building societies and credit unions – to accept deposits from non-members.

Following the Wallis Committee Report, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) was established on 1 July 1998 to take over from the RBA the oversight of ADI&#x27;s and other financial institutions in Australia, e.g., banks, credit unions, building societies, friendly societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance and most members of the superannuation industry. The Payments System Board (PSB) was also created, to maintain the safety and performance of the payments system.

At the time, consumer credit in Australia was primarily loaned in the form of installment sales credit. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of readily employable migrant workers under the post-war immigration scheme, coupled with intense competition amongst lenders, discouraged proper investigation into buyers. Concerns about the possibly inflationary impact of lending created the first finance companies in Australia.

In June 2017 the Treasurer, Hon Scott Morrison MP, initiated the Open Banking Review. Open Banking is to encourage more efficiency in the market, create new opportunities for market entrants, encourage competition and give customers greater control over their data. This was finalised in March 2018.

In 2018 APRA created a restricted ADI framework. The framework is designed to encourage new entrants to the banking industry, particularly small firms with limited financial resources, to navigate the licensing process. Eligible entities can conduct a limited range of business activities for two years while they progress towards an unrestricted status. APRA announced and authorised the first restricted ADI, Volt Bank, on 7 May 2018. On 1 September 2022, APRA announced it had revoked Volt Bank Limited&#x27;s (Volt) authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) licence under the Banking Act 1959.

<doc id="1322525" wikidata="Q7796731" url="?curid=1322525" title="Thorpeness">
<text>Thorpeness is a seaside village in the East Suffolk district of Suffolk, England, which developed in the early 20th century into an exclusive holiday village. It belongs to the parish of Aldringham cum Thorpe and lies within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB.

==Development==
&quot;For the earlier history of Thorpe, see Aldringham-cum-Thorpe.&quot;

The village was a small fishing hamlet originating in the late 19th century, with folk tales of it being a route for smugglers into East Anglia. The landowning Ogilvie family, began to buy into the area in 1859. In 1910, Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie, a Scottish barrister whose father had made a fortune building railways around the world, increased the family&#x27;s local estates to cover the entire area from north of Aldeburgh to past Sizewell, up the coast and inland to Aldringham and Leiston.

Most of this land was used for farming, but Ogilvie developed Thorpeness into an elite private fantasy holiday village, to which he invited his friends&#x27; and colleagues&#x27; families during the summer months. An exclusive country club with tennis courts, a swimming pool, clubhouse; a golf club designed by the eminent James Braid with its own club house; and many holiday homes were built in Jacobean and Tudor Revival styles. Thorpeness railway station, provided by the Great Eastern Railway to serve what was expected to be an expanding resort, was opened a few days before the outbreak of World War I. It was little used, except by golfers, and closed in 1966.

A notable feature of the village is a set of almshouses built in the 1920s to the design of W. G. Wilson. To hide the eyesore of having a water tower in the village, the tank built in 1923 was clad in wood to make it look like a small house on top of a five-storey tower, with a separate mill next to it, which pumped water to it. It is known as the &quot;House in the Clouds&quot;, and after mains water was installed in the village, the old tank was transformed into a huge games room with views over the land from Aldeburgh to Sizewell.

For three generations Thorpeness remained mostly in the private ownership of the Ogilvie family, with houses only being sold from the estate to friends as holiday homes. In 1972, Alexander Stuart Ogilvie, Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie&#x27;s grandson, died on the Thorpeness Golf Course. Many of the houses and the golf course and country club had to be sold to pay death duties.

==The Meare==
An artificial boating lake known as the Meare was created where there had once been an Elizabethan shipping haven that had silted up. Many of the inspirations for the Meare came from a personal friend of the Ogilvies, J. M. Barrie, who wrote &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Along with a large main pond, there are several channels with landings marked with names from the Peter Pan stories. Tiny islands on the Meare contain locations found in the novel, such as the pirates&#x27; lair, Wendy&#x27;s house, and many others, where children are encouraged to play. The Meare was dug to a shallow depth for safety reasons.

A variety of boats can be rented to enjoy the water, many of them originals dating from the creation of the Meare and named by the local workmen who had dug the lake. In August, the Meare serves as the location for the &quot;Thorpeness Regatta&quot;, which has been held since 1913.

==Thorpeness today==

To the south of the village lies the North Warren RSPB reserve, an area of wildlife and habitat conservation and nature trails run by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It has Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protection Area (SPA) status.

Like much of Britain&#x27;s East Coast, Thorpeness has had intermittent problems with coastal erosion. Discussions are still underway for further defences.

==In popular culture==
A lifeboat crew from Thorpeness rescues Tim and his friend the sea captain in the Edward Ardizzone book &quot;Little Tim and the Brave Sea Captain&quot; (1936).

==The Second World War==
*Radar: A radar installation was located in Thorpeness, Chain Home Extra Low Station K164.
*Coastal artillery: a lone 18-pounder field gun was sited in a concrete gun emplacement on the cliffs of Thorpeness. The gun was given the name John, while others elsewhere on the coast were named Matthew, Mark, Luke and St Peter.
*Anti-aircraft artillery.
* fell victim to a mine and sank close inshore off Thorpeness.
*In the run-up to the Second World War, a small British merchant vessel named &quot;Thorpeness&quot; was sunk by a torpedo fired by German forces off Spain.
*An anti-tank ditch ran from Aldringham to the Meare. This was dug by the 9th Battalion of the Cameronians.
*One regiment of the 1st Assault Brigade Royal Engineers arrived in Thorpeness in late 1943 and was stationed there.
*A detachment of 2711 Squadron, RAF Regiment, was stationed in Thorpeness, as was 2783 Squadron RAF Regiment.
*The Archaeological Service of Suffolk County Council produced a detailed report of the Second World War and other archaeological aspects of Thorpeness.

<doc id="1322528" wikidata="Q369494" url="?curid=1322528" title="Joint Electronics Type Designation System">
<text>The Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), which was previously known as the Joint Army-Navy Nomenclature System (AN System. JAN) and the Joint Communications-Electronics Nomenclature System, is a method developed by the U.S. War Department during World War II for assigning an unclassified designator to electronic equipment. In 1957, the JETDS was formalized in MIL-STD-196.

Computer software and commercial unmodified electronics for which the manufacturer maintains design control are not covered.

==Applicability==
Electronic material, from a military point of view, generally includes those electronic devices employed in data processing, detection and tracking (underwater, sea, land-based, air and space), recognition and identification, communications, aids to navigation, weapons control and evaluation, flight control, and electronics countermeasures. Nomenclature is assigned to:
* Electronic material of military design
* Commercial electronic material that has been modified for military use and requires military identification and design control
* Electronic material which is intended for use by other Federal agencies or other governments that participate in the nomenclature system.

This system is separate from the &quot;M&quot; designation used in the Army Nomenclature System (MIL-STD-1464A).

== Organization ==
Items are given an Item Level which describes their hierarchy
== Basic Structure ==
The core of the JETDS system is the combination of a Type Designation with an Item Name to specify a particular item.

For example:

* With the AN/PEQ-2A Infrared Illuminator, the &quot;AN/PEQ-2A&quot; is the Type Designation while the Item Name Code (INC) 26086 &quot;Illuminator, Infrared&quot; is the Item Name.

=== Type Designation ===
The type designation is a unique series of letters and numbers which specifies an item. There are three basic forms of type designator used:

* Type designators for definitive Systems, Subsystems, Centers, Central, and Sets (e.g. AN/SPY-1)
* Type designators for definitive Groups (e.g. OK-198/G)
* Type designators for definitive Units (e.g. R-1641A/GSQ)

=== Item Name ===
The Type Designation is used in conjunction with an approved Item Name drawn from the H-6 Item Name Directory.

For example:

* Item Name Code (INC) 48198 from the H-6 Item Name Directory refers to &quot;Terminal, Satellite Communications&quot;. This item name is used in the item officially designated as AN/FSC-78(V) Satellite Communications Terminal.

== Type Designation (Systems, Subsystems, Centers, Central, Sets) ==
The type designation used to specify Systems, Subsystems, Centers, Central, and Sets is made up of a prefix AN/, three type designation indicator letters, a hyphen, and a type designation number. The AN prefix signifies Army-Navy. The three type designation letters (chosen from the table below) specify where the equipment is used, what the equipment is, and what its purpose is. The type designation number helps specify the exact item; subsequent items with the same Installation/Type/Purpose are numbered sequentially (i.e. the next item developed after the AN/PRC-34 would be the AN/PRC-35).

For example:

* AN/PRC-77 is made up of
** AN/ Army-Navy
** PRC signifies Portable Radio used for two way Communications
** -77 the type designation number

* Additional info on Installation indicators:

* F is used for equipment installed in fixed ground (non-moveable) installations
* G is used for equipment which can be installed in two or more ground-based installation types
* M is used for equipment which is installed in a vehicle and is operated while the vehicle is in motion. M is only used when the vehicle&#x27;s sole function is to house, transport, and operate the equipment. The vehicle must be &quot;part of&quot; the equipment
* T is used for ground-based equipment that is designed to be moved from place to place and the equipment is not covered by the installation indicators G, M, P, U, V. The equipment is not capable of being operated while in transit.
* U is used for equipment which can be installed in two or more types of installation indicators (e.g. a particular equipment that can be ground-based or airborne). U can also be used for equipment which has components in more than one installation class (e.g. a particular equipment that has one component that is airborne and another component that is ground-based).
* V is used for equipment which is installed in a vehicle whose main purpose is not to carry the electronic equipment. For example, the radio installed in a tank would use V as the tank&#x27;s primary purpose is not just to carry the radio. The equipment must be usable while the vehicle is traveling.
* W is used for equipment that is installed in a vehicle which can be on the water&#x27;s surface or operate below the surface.
* Z is used for equipment installed in a vehicle which can be piloted or pilotless

** Additional info on Type of Equipment indicators:

* P is used for the following types of equipment:
** Radar equipment
** Beacons which function with radar equipment
** Electronic recognition and identification systems
** Pulse-type navigational systems

== Type Designation (Group) ==
The type designation used to specify Groups (assemblies that are used in conjunction with others to function) is made up of a two letter group indicator (from the table below), followed by a dash, a group number, followed by a slash, and 1-3 letters specifying the equipment it is &quot;part of&quot; or &quot;used with&quot; (see Table 1). If the group is unique and only &quot;part of&quot; or &quot;used with&quot; one particular equipment, that equipment may be specified. If the group may be used with multiple different items, then it is more appropriate to designate it more generally.

For example:

* OE-162/ARC would refer to an antenna group used with aircraft-based radio communications equipment (i.e. AN/ARC-x equipment)
* If the control group OK-414 is only used with AN/TPN-30 (and not used with any other items), then it can be termed OK-414/TPN-30
* If the control group OK-414 can be used with various different ground-transportable radar navigational aids (i.e. AN/TPN-x equipment), then it should be termed OK-414/TPN
* If the console OJ-301 can be used with various different water-based radars (i.e. AN/SP -x equipment), it should be termed OJ-301/SP
* If the receiver group OR-221 can be used with various different general utility items (i.e. AN/U -x equipment), it should be termed OR-221/U
== Type Designation (Unit) ==
The type designation used to specify Units is made up of a unit letter(s) indicator (from the table below), followed by a dash, a unit number, followed by a slash, and 1-3 letters specifying the equipment it is part of or used with (see Table 1). As with Group type designations, if the Unit is unique and is &quot;part of&quot; or &quot;used with&quot; only one particular equipment, that equipment may be specified. If the unit is used with multiple different items, the equipment designation should include only the indicators which are common or appropriate. If a unit could be described by multiple indicators, the indicator which best describes the unit&#x27;s primary function should be used. The exception would be if there exists a unit indicator which can describe the unit&#x27;s multiple functions (see examples below); if such a multi-function describing unit indicator exists, then it should be used.

For example:

* R-40/VRC would refer to a receiver used in conjunction with ground vehicle-based radio communications (i.e. AN/VRC-x equipment)
* If the receiver R-40 is only used with the AN/VRC-12, then it should be termed R-40/VRC-12
* If the power supply PP-50 is used with various different ground vehicle-based radio communications (i.e. AN/VRC-x equipment), it should be termed PP-50/VRC
* If a power supply PP-60 is used with various different ground vehicle-based radio equipment (e.g. it&#x27;s &quot;part of&quot; AN/VRC-12 and &quot;used with&quot; AN/VRR-40), it should be termed PP-60/VR
* If a power supply PP-70 is used with various ground vehicle-based equipment (e.g. it&#x27;s &quot;part of&quot; or &quot;used with&quot; the AN/GRC-26 and the AN/GPS-20), it should be termed PP-70/G
* A unit can function as an amplifier as well as a power supply but its primary purpose is as an amplifier. As a result, it is designated AM-250/U
* A unit has both receiver and transmitter functions but the RT- unit indicator exists and covers units that can receive and transmit. As a result, the unit is designated RT-100/PRQ-21
* A unit has both motor and generator functions but the PU- unit indicator exists and covers units that can function as a motor a generator. As a result, the unit is designated PU-181/PGC-1

== Additional Specifiers ==

=== Modification Letter ===
A modification letter is placed after the type designation number to signify a modification to a specific equipment that still retains at least one-way interchangeability with all previous versions. Modification letters begin with &quot;A&quot; and proceed sequentially. For more information on Interchangeability (see below).

Note: the letters &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; are not to be used as modification letters

For example:

* AN/PAS-13A and AN/PAS-13B are modifications of AN/PAS-13. A new AN/PAS-13A can be used in place of an AN/PAS-13 thermal sight; an AN/PAS-13B can be used in place of an AN/PAS-13 or an AN/PAS-13A.
* RT-206A is a modification of RT-206. A RT-206A can be used in place of an RT-206.

=== Specific Configurations of Variables ===
A suffix &quot;(V)&quot; following the type designation number and any modification letters indicates variable components or configurations for said Group/Set/Subsystem/System/Center/Central. A number may follow the parenthetical V to identify a specific configuration.

For example:

* AN/PRC-1(V) would be a complete radio communication set (AN/PRC-1) capable of operating in multiple different configurations with variable components.
* AN/PRC-1A(V)4 would be the 4th specific configuration of the AN/PRC-1A(V) radio communication set.
* OT-1957(V)2/PRC-1(V) would be the 2nd specific configuration of the OT-1957(V) transmitter group required as a component for the AN/PRC-1(V) radio communication set (which can be configured in various ways).

Note: A specific equipment should only be given a (V) signifier if it can be configured with different components, not simply because one of its components has a (V) signifier. The (V) signifier would be warranted if the item accepted variable configurations of a particular component.

For example:

* AN/ARC-190(V) would NOT be appropriate solely because it used the CU-2314(V)1/ARC-190 HF Antenna Coupler if it could only accept CU-2314-(V)1 and no other antenna coupler
* Since, in reality, AN/ARC-190(V) can actually accept CU-2314(V)1/ARC-190 as well as CU-2275(V)1/ARC-190, the (V) signifier is appropriate. It would also be appropriate even if it only accepted CU-2275(V)1/ARC-190 and CU-2275(V)2/ARC-190.

=== Plug-In (capable) ===
A suffix of &quot;(P)&quot; following the type designation number and any modification letters indicates a Unit which is designed to accept &quot;plug-in&quot; modules capable of changing the function, frequency, or other technical characteristics of the unit. The plug-in is not considered part of the unit itself.

For example:

* R-00(P)/PRC-1 would be a radio receiver unit (capable of accepting plug-in modules) that is required as a component for the AN/PRC-1 radio set.

=== Cryptographic/Classified ===
A suffix of &quot;(C)&quot; following the type designation number and any modification letters indicates an item which directly contains NSA-controlled cryptographic material. 
For example:

* AN/PRC-163B(V)2(P)(C) would be a portable radio receiver/transmitter AN/PRC-163, modification B, configuration 2, that accepts plug-ins and contains NSA-controlled cryptographic material.

=== Training (Set, Subsystem, System, Center, or Central) ===
A suffix of &quot;-T&quot;n&quot; &quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is a number, indicates equipment (Set, Subsystem, System, Center, or Central) designed to provide training in the operation of a specific set or multiple sets. If it is designed specifically to provide training for one particular unit, then that unit may be specified. If it is a training equipment which can provide practice for various different sets/subsystems/systems etc., then that should be indicated with the appropriate letter indicators.

For example:

* AN/PRC-1-T1 would be the first training set for the AN/PRC-1 radio set.
* AN/PRC-T3 would be the third training set for several different AN/PRC-&quot;n&quot; radio sets.
* AN/URC-T1 would be used for the first training set for AN/PRC-&quot;n&quot; and AN/VRC-&quot;n&quot; radio sets; this designation indicates a training set which can be used for complete radio sets of similar type and purpose but different installation locations (i.e. some are man-portable, some are vehicle-mounted).

=== Training (Group or Unit) ===

* A &quot;T&quot; is added after the type designation numbers for a Group or Unit if it is designed to provide training but is not considered &quot;part of&quot; other equipment. If it is &quot;part of&quot; other equipment, the T specifier is not used.

For example:

* RT-10T/PRC would indicate a training receiver/transmitter Unit that is used with radio sets.

=== Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) ===
A digit or digits in parentheses following the type designation letters indicates the type of ADPE included in the item.

For example:

* AN/UYK (1, 4, 5) contains a digital processor (1), Input/Output device (4), and tape equipment (5)
=== Maintenance Equipment ===
Maintenance equipment that is given a type designation is set up as AN/xxM, where the first two letters after the slash (signifying Installation and Type of equipment) are followed by an M.

However, if a maintenance or test Unit or Group is considered a &quot;part of&quot; the item in question, it does not receive the M signifier.

For example:

* AN/MPM-8 is used to maintain Radar Sets AN/MPG-5, AN/MPS-5, AN/MPS-12, and AN/MPN-9
* AN/URM-20 can be used to maintain Radio Set AN/TRC-7 or AN/ARC-2

=== Modified Power Requirements ===
A change in the power input voltage, phase, or frequency is denoted by addition of the letter(s) &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, or &quot;Z&quot;. The first such modification would be denoted with an &quot;X&quot;, the second with a &quot;Y&quot;, the third with a &quot;Z&quot;, the fourth with an &quot;XX&quot;, etc. If simultaneous modifications are made that improve the equipment as well as affect power input, then both a modification letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) as well as a power requirement modification letter (X, Y, Z, etc.) will be used.

For example:

* AN/TRC-100X is used for a model of AN/TRC-100 which is modified to run on 24v DC instead of the usual 110v AC 
* AN/TRC-100AX is used for a model of AN/TRC-100A which has modified power input requirements. Alternatively, it may be used if the model AN/TRC-100 underwent simultaneous modifications that improved the model and affected the power input.
* AN/TRC-100B(V)2Y would be the second such power modification to the AN/TRC-100B in its 2nd configuration form\

=== Developmental/Experimental ===
A pair of parentheses surrounding where the type designation number would be located is used to signify an experimental or developmental model. Type designation number is not required but is useful for clarity. When the developmental model is ready for production, the parentheses are struck off.

For example:

* AN/ARC-( ) would designate an experimental radio set
* AN/AAR-(87) would designate an experimental airborne invisible light or heat radiation detection system. When ready for production, it would become the AN/AAR-87

=== Servo Amplifiers ===
Electronic type (non-rotating) servo amplifiers are designated &quot;AM&quot;; rotating type servo amplifiers are designated &quot;PU&quot;.

=== Plug-in Units ===
Plug-in Units which can be described by their function (like receiver, microphone, loudspeaker, etc.) will use those corresponding Unit indicators. If no indicator exists to describe the plug-in&#x27;s function, then the generic plug-in unit indicator (PL) will be used.

For example:

* A microphone plug-in would be designated as MW-2/PRC
* A plug-in whose function can&#x27;t be described by an existing unit indicator would be designated as PL-1/ARC

=== Varying Lengths ===
Type designators for groups and units like cables, waveguides, cords, etc. may also include a parenthetical &quot;( -FT, -IN)&quot; to designate the specified length. These type designators will not include a specified System/Subsystem/Center/Central/Set type designator after the / but will be given a more generic indicator like /U or /GR. However, a group or unit type designation that is already linked to a specific system/subsystem/center/central/set may use ( -FT, -IN) if the system/subsystem/center/central/set uses multiple of the group/unit and they are only distinguishable by length. This use is only for new assignments and will not be retroactive

For example:

* A cable assembly which can be used with the AN/GRC-26 would not be designated CC-5/GRC-26 but would be designated CC-5/U or CC-5/GR.
* CX-13293/VRC is already linked to VRC, however, it may use the ( -FT, -IN) specifier because VRC configurations may use multiple CX-13293 group/units which are only distinguishable by length (e.g. CX-13293/VRC (6 FT, 0 IN) and CX-13293/VRC (8 FT, 0 IN)

=== Batteries ===
Primary batteries (non-rechargeable) are designated using &quot;BA&quot;; Secondary type batteries (rechargeable) are designated using &quot;BB&quot;.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Interchangeability ===

* One-way Interchangeability: the later modified version of an item can be used in place of earlier versions but not the other way around. Essentially it is backwards compatibility.
* Electrical Interchangeability: the later modified item can be used in place of any earlier models without requiring any work to the electrical systems (i.e. rewiring, use of adapters, etc.).
* Mechanical Interchangeability: the modified item can be installed and used without any major physical modifications. Switches, connectors, etc. will be in the same general location as before. Once installed, the modified item will not substantially affect its &quot;parent&quot; item&#x27;s center of gravity.
* Functional Interchangeability: the modified item can perform the same task as earlier models without requiring any assistance.
* Maintenance parts Interchangeability: the modified maintenance part can be installed into an item without requiring any additional tools or modifications and without affecting the item&#x27;s performance or ratings.

=== &quot;Part of&quot; vs &quot;Used with&quot; ===

* An item is &quot;part of&quot; a specific equipment if it is required for that equipment to function. Items that are &quot;part of&quot; a particular equipment will be listed in the equipment&#x27;s complement data and will always be issued with that equipment
* An item is &quot;used with&quot; a specific equipment if it functions with or alongside that equipment but is not issued with it. This can include items of the same item level or higher item level. An item which augments or extends the function of an equipment and is only issued under special circumstances is considered as &quot;used with&quot; but not &quot;part of&quot; said equipment.

== History ==
JETDS was adopted 16 February 1943 by the Joint Communications Board for all new Army and Navy airborne, radio, and radar equipment. Over time it was extended to cover the Marine Corps and the Navy&#x27;s ship, submarine, amphibious, and ground electronic equipment. When the Air Force was established as a separate department, it continued the use of the system for electronic equipment. JETDS was adopted by the United States Coast Guard in 1950, Canada in 1951 and the NSA in 1959 (though the NSA continued to use its own TSEC telecommunications security nomenclature). In 1957 the U.S. Department of Defense approved a military standard for the nomenclature, MIL-STD-196. The system has been modified over time, with some types (e.g. carrier pigeon -B-) dropped and others (e.g. computers and cryptographic equipment) added. The latest version, MIL-STD-196G, was issued in 2018.
== Derived systems ==
* The Japan Self-Defense Forces use a similar system that replaces the &quot;AN/&quot; prefix with &quot;J/&quot;. Equipment sharing the same designation may or may not be equivalent. For example, the J/AWG-12 fitted on the Mitsubishi F-1 is said to be closely related to the AN/AWG-12, but the 1990s J/APG-1 is clearly different from the 1940s AN/APG-1 on the P-61B.
* The Military of the Republic of China (Taiwan) uses a similar system with the &quot;CS/&quot; prefix. For example, CS/MPG-25 is a radar related to the AN/MPQ-46.

== Notes ==
*The US government&#x27;s BINCS database currently assigns CAGE code 80058 to JETDS items.
*The US government&#x27;s system for input of Form DD-61 Request for Nomenclature is the Joint Electronic Type Designation Automated System (JETDAS).

<doc id="1322542" wikidata="Q1924126" url="?curid=1322542" title="Grande École (film)">
<text>Grande École is a 2004 French erotic drama film directed by , based on the stage play &quot;The Best of Schools&quot; by Jean-Marie Besset. The film is about education, class, race and homosexuality.

It was cited as an early example of casting Arab men as gays compared to heterosexual white men in French films, Salim Kechiouche as &#x27;Mecir&#x27;.

==Plot==
Paul is an upper-class young man who is about to start at a &quot;grande école&quot;, one of the system of mostly public colleges to which students are admitted based on a highly competitive process and whose graduates often gain prestigious employment. He has chosen to live with two new roommates instead of his girlfriend Agnès.

As a result, with his studies, he has little time to see her. Agnès perceives cracks in their relationship when she suspects Paul&#x27;s attraction to one of his new roommates, the aristocratic Louis-Arnault. Paul denies any homosexual attraction, but Agnès decides to make a bet with him: whichever of them beds Louis-Arnault first wins. If she does, Paul must stop exploring his sexuality; if he does, she will leave him.

Before the bet plays out, Paul meets Mécir, a young Arab worker, who becomes besotted with him. With Mécir, Paul goes on a journey of discovery that changes many of his ideas about class, cultural differences and sexuality.

==Cast==
* as Paul
* Alice Taglioni as Agnès
* Jocelyn Quivrin as Louis-Arnault
* Élodie Navarre as Emeline
* Arthur Jugnot as Chouquet
* Salim Kechiouche as Mécir
* Éva Darlan as Mrs Chouquet
* Yasmine Belmadi as worker in flashback
* Arnaud Binard as water polo trainer

==Reception==
The film won the IFFR Audience Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam.

&quot;Grande École&quot; has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes 3 reviews are listed, 2 positive, 1 negative.

Nick Jones of eyeforfilm.co stated, &quot;rather than focusing on the central, emotional aspect of the story – Paul coming to terms with his sexuality – Salis tries to cover other issues in too much detail&quot; and &quot;you are left feeling short-changed by a script that conveniently ignores certain issues and abandons characters for its own means&quot;.

Pierre Murat from telerama.fr said, &quot;Robert Salis films rather well desire, first unconscious and then assumed&quot;, but &quot;he films the pleasure less well&quot; and &quot;the actors do not lack courage, especially Jocelyn Quivrin&quot;.

Barry Forshaw in 2015 called it &quot;powerful and moving drama&quot; and &quot;an passionate and erotic film&quot;.

It is mentioned in &quot;Vitamin Q&quot; book by Jim Brogan in 2014, &quot;beautiful, naked men, particularly in the showers of a local water polo club&quot;.

<text>Preston School of Industry was an American indie rock band formed by Scott Kannberg (a.k.a. Spiral Stairs) in 1999, following the dissolution of his previous band, Pavement. Its name is taken from the well known US reform school of the same name, Preston School of Industry in Ione, California.

The band&#x27;s earliest studio release was a cover of Phish&#x27;s &quot;Axilla II&quot; for the charity tribute album &quot;Sharin&#x27; in the Groove&quot;. In 2001, Preston School of Industry released &quot;All This Sounds Gas&quot;. The band released its second album, &quot;Monsoon&quot;, in 2004, with studio contributions from members of The Minus 5 and Wilco.

Preston School of Industry went inactive after their September 2004 Australian tour, though Kannberg revealed in late 2006 he had been slowly working on a record: &quot;Don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s going to be released. Just taking my time, nothing special. I&#x27;ve got the songs, I just haven&#x27;t figured out how I want to do it yet.

<doc id="1322555" wikidata="Q161665" url="?curid=1322555" title="Rhodiola rosea">
<text>Rhodiola rosea (commonly golden root, rose root, roseroot, Aaron&#x27;s rod, Arctic root, king&#x27;s crown, lignum rhodium, orpin rose) is a perennial flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It grows naturally in wild Arctic regions of Europe (including Britain), Asia, and North America ( N.B., Nfld. and Labrador, N.S., QC.; Alaska, Maine, N.Y., N.C., Pa., Vt), and can be propagated as a groundcover.

Although &quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot; has been used in traditional medicine, there is no high-quality clinical evidence of its effectiveness to treat any disease. The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued several warnings to manufacturers of &quot;R. rosea&quot; dietary supplements for making false health claims about its safety and efficacy. 

The plant is threatened in many countries due to rapidly growing demand. Supply comes mostly from wild harvesting on an industrial scale, and a combination of growing scarcity and a lack of regulation has led to environmental degradation, substitution or adulteration in the market, and illegal harvesting in protected areas.

==Description==
&quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot; is from tall, fleshy, and has several stems growing from a short, scaly rootstock. Flowers have 4 sepals and 4 petals, yellow to greenish yellow in color sometimes tipped with red, about long, and blooming in summer. Several shoots growing from the same thick root may reach in height. &quot;R. rosea&quot; is dioecious – having separate female and male plants.


=== Taxonomy ===
&quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot; was first described by Pedanius Dioscorides in De Materia Medica. Many North American plants formerly included in &quot;R. rosea&quot; are now treated separately as &quot;Rhodiola integrifolia&quot; and &quot;Rhodiola rhodantha&quot;.

===Chemical constituents===
About 140 chemical compounds are in the subterranean portions of &quot;R. rosea&quot;. &quot;Rhodiola&quot; roots contain phenols, rosavin, rosin, rosarin, organic acids, terpenoids, phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids, anthraquinones, alkaloids, tyrosol, and salidroside.

The chemical composition of the essential oil from &quot;R. rosea&quot; root growing in different countries varies. For example, rosavin, rosarin, and rosin at their highest concentration according to many tests can be found only in &quot;R. rosea&quot; of Russian origin; the main components of the essential oil from &quot;Rhodiola&quot; growing in Bulgaria are geraniol and myrtenol; in China the main components are geraniol and 1-octanol; and in India the main component is phenethyl alcohol. Cinnamyl alcohol was discovered only in the sample from Bulgaria.

Although rosavin, rosarin, rosin, and salidroside (and sometimes p-tyrosol, rhodioniside, rhodiolin, and rosiridin) are among suspected active ingredients of &quot;R. rosea&quot;, these compounds are mostly polyphenols. There are no peer-reviewed studies demonstrating that these chemicals have any physiological effect in humans that could prevent or reduce risk of disease. Although these phytochemicals are typically mentioned as specific to &quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot; extracts, &quot;rosea&quot; and other &quot;Rhodiola&quot; species contain many other constituent polyphenols, including proanthocyanidins, quercetin, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid and kaempferol.

==Distribution==
&quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot; grows in cold regions of the world, including much of the Arctic, the mountains of Central Asia, scattered in eastern North America and mountainous parts of Europe. It grows on sea cliffs and on mountains at high altitude.

==Uses==

===Culinary use===
The leaves and shoots are eaten raw, having a bitter flavor, or cooked like spinach, and are sometimes added to salads. An extract is sometimes added as a flavoring in vodkas.

===Research and regulation===
Rhodiola has been used as a dietary supplement. Through 2019, human studies evaluating &quot;R. rosea&quot; did not have sufficient quality to determine whether it has properties affecting fatigue or any other condition. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warning letters to manufacturers of &quot;R. rosea&quot; dietary supplement products unapproved as new drugs, adulterated, misbranded and in federal violation for not having proof of safety or efficacy for the advertised conditions of alleviating Raynaud syndrome, altitude sickness, depression or cancer.

A 2012 report by the European Medicines Agency on literature concerning the dried extract of &quot;R. rosea&quot; stated that &quot;The published clinical trials exhibit considerable deficiencies in their quality. Therefore &#x27;well-established use&#x27; cannot be accepted&quot;.

== Protection and management ==
&quot;Rhodiola rosea&quot; has not been assessed on the IUCN red list, but is listed on the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix II which &quot;includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.&quot;.

<doc id="1322557" wikidata="Q841952" url="?curid=1322557" title="Pip (South Park)">
<text>&quot;Pip&quot; (also known as &quot;Great Expectations&quot;) is the fourteenth episode in the fourth season of the American animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. The 62nd episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 29, 2000. Going by production order, it is the fifth episode of the fourth season instead of the fourteenth. The episode is a parody and comedic retelling of Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1861 novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, and stars the &quot;South Park&quot; character Pip, who assumes the role of the protagonist of the novel, who is his eponym. &quot;Pip&quot; features no other regular characters from the show. The story is narrated in a live action parody of the anthology television series &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot;, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell.

Pip as a character was established to originate from the Dickens novel early on in the series, and &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had the idea of retelling &quot;Great Expectations&quot; with the character for a long time. &quot;Pip&quot; has a unique design and animation compared to other episodes. To achieve this look, many assets had to be built from scratch. This was a demanding task for the &quot;South Park&quot; studios at the time, and production of the episode was stretched out across several months. The concept of the episode changed significantly during this time; for example, the original plan was for the episode to be a musical.

Parker and Stone have said that &quot;Pip&quot; is one of the least-popular episodes. The episode was written by Parker and directed by animation director Eric Stough. Since its original airing, it has been re-run infrequently on Comedy Central.

==Plot==
The story is set in a 19th-century-like England, in a small town called Draftingshire-Upon-Topsmart. An orphaned Pip is on his way to visit his parents&#x27; grave. While there, an escaped convict appears and threatens Pip. Pip, out of the goodness of his heart, aids the convict by giving him food and cutting the convict&#x27;s handcuffs. He then goes home, where his sister&#x27;s husband Joe reads an advertisement about a Miss Havisham seeking a boy to play with her daughter. Pip goes and meets the daughter, Estella, who constantly insults him. Miss Havisham hires Pip and throughout their playtimes he eventually falls in love with Estella.

Pip fears Estella could never marry a commoner like him. However, an offer comes for Pip from an anonymous benefactor to move to London and learn how to become a gentleman. Pip assumes the benefactor is Miss Havisham and accepts. In London, Pip meets his roommate Mr. Pocket who tells the story of Miss Havisham: she got engaged but was left at the altar, causing her to stop all the clocks in the house and never leave the house again. Pip spends the rest of his time in London learning how to be a gentleman.

After his time in London, he shows up at Miss Havisham&#x27;s house, where she tells Pip that he can find Estella at a party at the palace. At the ball, Pip and Estella dance, and talk about how Pip is now a fine young gentleman. Estella says that she has no heart, and cannot love. Just before Pip asks Estella to be his girlfriend, her boyfriend, a modernly American seventeen-year-old named Steve, enters the scene.

Pip, saddened, runs to tell Miss Havisham, only to find that she approves of Steve. Miss Havisham is glad that Estella has broken Pip&#x27;s heart and she explains that she has Estella break men&#x27;s hearts to use their tears to power her &quot;Genesis Device&quot;. She desires youth and wants to use the device to switch bodies with Estella. She then uses robot monkeys to attack Pip. Pip escapes and falls unconscious, awakening back home with Joe and Pocket. The anonymous person who sent Pip to London is revealed to be the escaped convict Pip met at the beginning of the story. Because of Pip&#x27;s kindness, the convict led a life of goodness and became a millionaire. Sending Pip to London was his way of repaying Pip for the good that Pip did for him. The four of them, Pip, Joe, Pocket, and the convict, decide to stop Miss Havisham.

The group returns to the mansion discovering a bunch of men and boys with broken hearts and Miss Havisham powering up her device. Despite difficulties, such as the convict getting killed by an acid-spewing Miss Havisham, Pip manages to convince Estella to leave the machine, destroying it and setting Miss Havisham on fire. Fleeing the burning mansion, Pip&#x27;s group and the hostage males escape as Estella finally declares her love for Pip. Ending the story, the narrator states that the characters &quot;all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B.&quot;

==Production and broadcast==

Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker had the idea to recreate Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in the style of &quot;South Park&quot; from the very beginning of the series. The character of Pip has been a minor character on &quot;South Park&quot; from the show&#x27;s onset, having appeared in the pilot episode, &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot;. Pip had a somewhat bigger role in the original, unaired version of the pilot, but most of his scenes have been cut from the reworked and shorter broadcast version. One of these cut scenes, a short sequence in the school cafeteria that introduces Pip, was reinserted into the show&#x27;s fifth episode &quot;An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig&quot; (as the scene came from the pilot, it was created with traditional paper cutout stop motion animation). In the scene, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip&#x27;s reply - &quot;my father&#x27;s family-name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue-&quot; - is identical to the opening line of the novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip.

Production for the episode started after the first run of the series&#x27;s fourth season, which consisted of four episodes. At the beginning of the second run, of six episodes (which started broadcasting in June 2000), the episode was assigned a production code number of 405 (meaning the 5th episode of the 4th season), and it was planned to air in June or July that year. However, given the complicated nature of the episode&#x27;s look, where many elements had to be designed from scratch, the studio did not have enough time to finish the episode that summer, and it was moved to the next batch of episodes. As it was already in production before the run, &quot;Pip&quot; was a &quot;banked&quot; episode of &quot;South Park&quot;, one of the first in the series&#x27;s history. Whereas most episodes of &quot;South Park&quot; are created within a week, from scratch, the creators sometimes try to have one episode &quot;in the bank&quot; - meaning that they have &quot;at least half-start&quot; animating it. This way they can take off a few days during the two-month-long, demanding run, and then go back and finish work on the banked show. After completing the previous episode, &quot;Helen Keller! The Musical&quot;, which aired on November 22, 2000, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 23), the creators went to spend time with their families for the holiday, and then came back on Sunday, November 26, to finish &quot;Pip&quot;. The episode aired the next Wednesday, on November 29, 2000 on Comedy Central in the United States, as the 14th episode of the season, and the fourth episode of the winter run. Since its original airing, it has been re-run infrequently on Comedy Central.

The episode, directed by &quot;South Park&quot; animation director Eric Stough, has a unique look compared to most other episodes of the series. The creators wanted a different design for Pip&#x27;s England featured in the episode. For example, the directions for the exterior scenes were to make them look like they were &quot;right out of a Dickens novel&quot;. To achieve the style, assets had to be built from scratch, including many new characters with &quot;new mouths with rotten-out teeth&quot; that were used for most of them. At the beginning of the episode, Pip is dressed in more ragged clothing than he usually wears in &quot;South Park&quot;. Later, when he becomes a gentleman in London, he is wearing his usual &quot;South Park&quot; attire, including his bow tie. The character of Pocket is designed to look similar to the children in the 1974 Rankin/Bass animated Christmas television special &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;.
From its inception to its broadcast, there were many changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, &quot;Pip&quot; was going to be a musical episode, the first &quot;South Park&quot; musical since the 1999 movie &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;. At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the &quot;South Park&quot; Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows &quot;Pip walk[ing] up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel&quot;. Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman - much like the scene in &quot;An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig&quot;. In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, &quot;bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story&quot; would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to make the episode without the &quot;South Park&quot; boys, precisely &quot;ecause it&#x27;s a bad idea&quot;. Having an episode&#x27;s worth of story told in front of the class was later used in the season eighth episode &quot;Woodland Critter Christmas&quot;, which has Cartman telling a Christmas-themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story&#x27;s narration in that episode resembles the ending in &quot;Pip&quot;. In &quot;Pip&quot;, the narrator ends the story with the line &quot;And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B&quot;. In &quot;Woodland Critter Christmas&quot;, Cartman finishes the story by saying &quot;And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later&quot;. Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot;. In the end, the creators decided to do the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; parody in live-action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it was going to be an &quot;extremely different experience&quot; from the other episodes, and that they are not going to see the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode &quot;Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus&quot; - which also revolves entirely around two minor characters - about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; - which McDowell starred in - and its director Stanley Kubrick.

&quot;Pip&quot; features regular voice-acting from Parker and Stone for most characters (with Stone as the voice of Pip), as well as Eliza Schneider (credited both by her real name and her pseudonym &quot;Blue Girl&quot;) providing the voice for Estella. Joe was voiced by &quot;South Park&quot; staff writer Kyle McCulloch, because, according to Stone, McCulloch &quot;can do really good British voices, because he grew up in Canada watching a bunch of British TV&quot;.

==Cultural references and themes==
&quot;Pip&quot; serves as an explanation of the origins of its central character, as well as a retelling of the 1861 Charles Dickens novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. The episode is not a straight adaptation of the novel, but a comedic retelling thereof. As such, the episode&#x27;s main aim is not to represent &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, but to use it for the purpose of comedy. Some of Pip&#x27;s speech, such as &quot;breaky-wakey out of prison&quot; and &quot;that&#x27;s a lot of money-woney&quot; is a reference to Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s character Alex&#x27;s speech in the 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Many of the central characters of the novel appear in the episode. These include Pip, as well as Joe (Pip&#x27;s brother-in-law), Mrs Joe (Pip&#x27;s sister), Miss Havisham, Estella Havisham, Herbert Pocket, and the escaped convict. For most of the episode, the plot stays relatively faithful to the novel&#x27;s basic story. At one point however, the episode begins major digressions from the novel, mainly Miss Havisham&#x27;s technology, such as her Genesis Device and robot monkeys. The ending of the episode has been viewed as &quot;a joke about contemporary Hollywood&#x27;s inability to produce entertainment that does not depend on idiotic spectacle.&quot;

The way the story is presented - &quot;South Park Classics&quot; - is a parody of &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; (now continued as &quot;Masterpiece Classic&quot;), a drama anthology television series airing on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States, best known for presenting adaptations of classic works of literature. (Incidentally, &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; featured an adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in 1999.) Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s portrayal of the narrator parodies Alistair Cooke, &quot;a British person&quot; himself, who was the host of &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; between 1971 and 1992. The setup has been viewed as &quot;a joke about America&#x27;s (or more specifically, the typical PBS viewer&#x27;s) haughty search for cultural enrichment in the English classics&quot;, based on the context of &quot;he cultural authority of the British, so long courted by the American culture industries.&quot;

==Reception and home media==
&quot;Pip&quot; is a relatively unpopular episode of the series. According to creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, it is &quot;probably one of the least-popular episodes of &quot;South Park&quot;&quot; they have ever produced, and &quot;most people pretty much hated it&quot;. In 2004, Stone said that he considers the episode &quot;really cool&quot; and &quot;really good&quot;. In a 2011 &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; feature, the two named what they consider the best 15 episodes of &quot;South Park&quot;, along with the 53 worst. &quot;Pip&quot; was number 49 on the &quot;Worst&quot; list (following the first 48 spots which collectively consisted of every episode from the first three seasons). Parker said that &quot;Everyone, including we, hates &#x27;Pip&#x27;&quot;, and Stone said &quot;I don&#x27;t hate it. But it was like, &#x27;Why did you guys do that?&#x27;.&quot; The creators said that recreating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in &quot;South-Park&quot;-style &quot;seemed like a decent-enough idea, except that kinda sucks, especially its ending&quot;. They have concluded that while they sometimes want to do an episode that is different in style and presentation to the other episodes, it is necessary to have the story involve the regular characters, otherwise audiences will not like it.

In his paper about the episode, Jeffrey Sconce wrote that the episode ultimately &quot;proved a rather self-indulgent effort&quot;, and that it had failed &quot;in terms of viewer-response and ratings&quot;. In their review of the fourth season DVD, IGN called the episode &quot;a serious fizzle&quot;, saying that the creators &quot;don&#x27;t always hit a home-run&quot;.

<text>Carl Sverker Åström (30 December 1915 – 26 June 2012) was a Swedish diplomat. After completing his studies, Åström began his career as an attaché at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm. He served in the Soviet Union during World War II and later held posts in Washington, D.C., and London, rising to key leadership roles at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. From 1964 to 1970, he served as Sweden&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, followed by leading Sweden&#x27;s EEC treaty negotiations. He later became State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and ambassador to France before retiring in 1982.

==Early life and education==
Åström was born on 30 December 1915 in Uppsala, Sweden, the son of John Åström, a lawyer, and his wife Brita Kugelberg. His father died shortly before the Kreuger Crash in 1930.

Åström studied at Uppsala University where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1935 and a Candidate of Law in 1939. Åström was a member of the National Student Association in Uppsala, an organization affiliated with the pro-Nazi National League of Sweden, from 1932 to 1937.

==Diplomatic career==
Following his studies, Åström was employed as an attaché at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm. From 1940 to 1943 he served at the Swedish mission to the Soviet Union, first in Moscow and then in Kuybyshev. He then served at the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm from 1943 to 1946. In 1946 he became legation secretary at the Swedish embassy in Washington, D.C. He returned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1948 and became director () there in 1949. From 1953 to 1956 he served as embassy councillor at the Swedish embassy in London, and from 1956 to 1963 he was head of the political division and a director () at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

In 1964, Åström succeeded Agda Rössel as Sweden&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He stayed on this post until 1970, when he became Sweden&#x27;s chief negotiator on the EEC treaty in Brussels. Thereafter he served as deputy state secretary for foreign affairs from 1971 to 1972 and state secretary for foreign affairs from 1972 to 1977, and as Swedish ambassador to France from 1978 until his retirement in 1982.

Although Åström was a close friend of Olof Palme, the former Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Party, Åström was never member of, or attached to, a political party.

==Later life==
Åström&#x27;s autobiography, (&quot;Moments: From Half a Century in the Duty of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs&quot;), was published in 1992.

In 2003, at the age of 87, Åström came out as a homosexual. In an interview he has explained that his role as a diplomat made it impossible to declare himself as homosexual in public, but that his superiors and others were informed to eliminate the possibility of him being blackmailed by foreign agents.

In 2004 he received the &quot;Gay person of the Year&quot;-award from the Swedish gay-oriented magazine &quot;QX&quot;. In 2006 he was one of the co-hosts of the Swedish TV-series &quot;Böglobbyn&quot; (&quot;The Gay Lobby&quot;) on Sveriges Television. However he decided to leave the series after just two episodes had been broadcast.

In 2011 Åström was awarded the congress prize from the Green Party recognizing his contributions to the global environment through the UN Environment Conference in Stockholm 1972.

He died in Stockholm in 2012.

<doc id="1322649" wikidata="Q3077778" url="?curid=1322649" title="Fort Benjamin Hawkins">
<text>Fort Hawkins was a fort built between 1806 and 1810 by the United States Army during President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s administration. Built in what is now Georgia on the Fall Line on the east side of the Ocmulgee River, the fort overlooked the Ocmulgee Old Fields. The Lower Creek Trading Path passed by just outside the fort&#x27;s northwestern blockhouse, and continued in a westerly direction to a natural ford on the Ocmulgee River. The fort became important to the Lower Creek Indians, the United States, and the State of Georgia for economic, military, and political reasons.

The fort originally had a log palisade wall surrounding a 1.4-acre area, which contained living and working quarters for soldiers and officers, as well as two blockhouses on the northwestern and southeastern corners. A replica of the southeastern blockhouse was begun in 1928 based on architectural plans by Curran Ellis and Henry Behr, but not completed until 1938. A small archaeological excavation was conducted in 1936. The Fort Hawkins Archeological Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is included within the boundaries of the Fort Hill Historic District, also listed on the NRHP.

The Fort Hawkins Commission ran the site from 1990-2018. Under the guidance of Chairman Bob Cramer, the commission hired the Lamar Institute to conduct archaeological excavations in 2005. These excavations continued intermittently until 2013, and found evidence of a second palisade wall, as well as several brick buildings, and recovered nearly 40,000 artifacts. Historical research by Dan Elliott has also added greatly to the current understanding of the fort. A replica log cabin was dedicated in 2014 to serve as a Visitors&#x27; Center. The commission was replaced by the non-profit Fort Hawkins Foundation, Inc. in 2018, and this organization has run the site ever since. 

== History ==
Fort Hawkins was built by the United States in 1806, and was a place of &quot;relatively great economic, military, and political importance.&quot; For the Creek Nation, it was a center of the deerskin trade with Americans, who had a trading post or factory there.

The US government used the fort as the Southeastern Command of the U.S. Army. It was &quot;a major troop garrison and bivouac point for regular troops and state militia in several important campaigns, and a major government fur trade factory for regulating the Creek economy.&quot; The Creek Indians ceded their lands east of the Ocmulgee River, except for the Ocmulgee Old Fields. The fort was built on the highest ground in the immediate vicinity. The Lower Creek Trading Path passed just outside of the fort&#x27;s northwestern blockhouse. This ancient path was improved and became a part of the Federal Road to connect the nation&#x27;s capital city with the ports of Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana. This change encouraged the travel of many more troops, settlers, and visitors to the area.

Fort Hawkins (not Fort Benjamin Hawkins) was named for Benjamin Hawkins, who served as the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs (1796–1816) South of the Ohio River, as well as principal US Indian agent to the Creek. A former US Senator from North Carolina, Hawkins had been appointed by President George Washington to deal with the Choctaw, Cherokee and Chickasaw in the larger territory, and worked to bring about years of peace between the Creek and American settlers. Hawkins was named the Beloved Man of the Southeastern tribes, indicating the respect they had for him. He married Lavinia Downs, the daughter of Isaac Downs, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War.

Fort Hawkins was used during the U.S. military campaigns of the War of 1812 against Great Britain. General Andrew Jackson visited the Fort and used it as a staging area for the Battle of New Orleans from 1814-15, as well as during the Creek and Seminole wars. After the frontier moved farther west, the military threat to interior Georgia essentially receded. Through the treaties of 1825 and 1826, the Creek were forced to move west of the Chattahoochee River. The city of Macon was founded in 1823, and by 1828, the fort was in private ownership.

== Preservation, reconstruction and excavation ==
From 1928, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Macon Kiwanis Club raised funds to create a replica of one of the blockhouses to memorialize the fort. In 1936, archaeological a small excavation under the direction of archaeologist Gordon Willey, and supported by workers and funded under the US Works Progress Administration (WPA) was conducted. The reconstruction of a replica of the souteastern blockhouse was completed in 1938. Some of the original stones were recovered to be used in the basement section. The upper floors were made of concrete formed to simulate the original wood timbers, intended to be more durable at a time of uncertain funding for historic projects.

Because historical records had been destroyed when Washington, D.C., was burned during the War of 1812, in 1971 the city authorized limited archaeological excavation to establish the original dimensions of the fort. The excavation revealed numerous ceramic artifacts, including remnants of English-American style dishes used by residents, dated from c.1779 – c.1834. Fort Hawkins was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). in 1977.

The City of Macon acquired the historic site in 2002 with help from the state&#x27;s Greenspace Program and the Peyton Anderson Foundation. After redevelopment, the city and Commission plan to use the fort site as a greenspace park and as a history center for the city. The southeast blockhouse, which is opened to the public, has become an icon of the city. Archeologists were concerned that construction of the Fort Hawkins Grammar School and a road on part of the site in the early 20th century had destroyed the archaeological record. Since 2005, archeological excavations at the fort site have shown that extensive artifacts and stratigraphy have survived and can be interpreted.

From 2005 to 2007, the Fort Hawkins Commission, with funding from the Peyton Anderson Foundation and the City of Macon, hired the Lamar Institute to conduct extensive excavations of the fort site. Principal Archaeologist Dan Elliott&#x27;s work revealed evidence of two palisade walls having been constructed there. The second palisade enclosed several brick buildings, making it a more substantial complex than originally thought by the limited historical descriptions. In 2007, additional palisades were found. Related historical research has indicated that these were probably constructed from 1809–1810 by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Regiment of Rifles.

The nearly 40,000 artifacts recovered from the fort era (1806–1821), provide insight into the lives of the different groups of people interacting with one another on the American frontier. This evidence demonstrates a more complex and significant history at the fort than previously known. This physical evidence proves that the fort was more important than previously understood, indicating the need for additional study and a more thorough interpretation of the artifacts. Excavations in October 2011 concentrated on the outer western and southern walls (circa 1810) of the former stockade. An intrusive 19th century cellar, associated with the Thomas Woolfolk plantation, was also sampled during the 2011 field season. Limited excavations in May 2012 focused on discovering remnants of the northwestern blockhouse. Indirect evidence of the blockhouse is indicated by the abrupt termination of the western palisade wall (circa 1806) at its northern end. All outward indications of the blockhouse have been lost to erosion and grading.

Today, the Fort Hawkins Foundation, Inc. operates the Fort Hawkins site, and is currently making plans for the reconstruction of the entire fort complex as a site where the public may immerse themselves in the history and archaeology of Fort Hawkins, the Woolfolk Plantation, and Fort Hawkins School - all of which have been situated on the property at different times.

Fort Hawkins also hosts the Ocmulgee Archaeological Society, which holds its monthly meetings at the Visitors&#x27; Center at 6:30 pm on the first Monday of each month (excluding holidays). This archaeological non-profit specializes in public archaeology, and has hosted Fort Hawkins Archaeology Day each May since 2004 on the grounds of this important historic archaeological site

<text>Morten Per Olsen (; born 14 August 1949) is a Danish football manager and former player. He was the head coach of the Denmark national team for 15 years from 2000 until 2015, guiding Denmark to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2004 European Championship, 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2012 European Championship. He has also managed Brøndby to two Danish Superliga championships and Ajax to the Double of the 1998 Eredivisie championship and Dutch Cup trophy. He is one of only two persons ever in football, alongside Didier Deschamps, to achieve 100 national matches for his country both as player as well as coach.

In his active career, Olsen predominantly played as a defensive midfielder and libero. He played professionally in Belgium and Germany, and won the 1983 UEFA Cup and three Belgian First Division championships with Anderlecht. Olsen played a total 102 matches and scored four goals for the Danish national team from 1970 to 1989, and was named 1983 and 1986 Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot;. He captained the Danish national team in 50 games during the 1980s, and represented Denmark at the 1984 European Championship, 1986 FIFA World Cup, and 1988 European Championship. Towards the end of his active career, Olsen was characterized as the most important player in the history of Danish football.

==Playing career==

===Club career===
Born in Vordingborg, Morten Olsen started playing youth football at the local club in 1957. He started his career playing as a right winger. In 1970, at 20 years of age, he was brought to B 1901 in the top-flight Danish 1st Division championship by coach Kurt &quot;Nikkelaj&quot; Nielsen. At B 1901, Olsen was moved from right winger to central midfielder, in order to accommodate another right winger in the squad.

Olsen played three seasons at B 1901, before he moved abroad to play professionally with Belgian club Cercle Brugge in 1972, who had been promoted to the top-flight Belgian First Division championship one year earlier. At Brugge, Olsen played alongside fellow Danish international Benny Nielsen, who had recommended Olsen to Brugge manager Urbain Braems. In Olsen&#x27;s first year with the club, Cercle Brugge finished in eleventh place in the 1972–73 Belgian First Division and went on to establish itself in the mid-table. While at Brugge, Olsen was used as a multi-purpose player, playing every position except from goalkeeper. In 1976, Olsen moved to league rivals Molenbeek, who had won the 1974–75 Belgian First Division. Olsen joined Danish internationals Benny Nielsen and Kresten Bjerre at Molenbeek. His time at Molenbeek featured even better league results, and consistent finishes in the top third of the league.

In 1980, Olsen moved to 16-time Belgian champions Anderlecht, to play alongside Danish internationals Benny Nielsen and Kenneth Brylle. In his first year at Anderlecht, the club won the 1980–81 Belgian First Division, conceding only 24 goals in 34 games. It was for Olsen the first trophy of his senior career. He played six years at Anderlecht, winning three Belgian championships with the club, and he was eventually named Anderlecht team captain. During most of 1982, Olsen suffered from a severe shin injury, which prompted Anderlecht manager Tomislav Ivic to move him back from the midfield into the libero position. As the libero at Anderlecht, Olsen controlled an aggressive form of off-side trap, which had 3–4 players converge towards the ball-possessing player as the off-side trap was sprung, in order to prevent the ball-possessing player from countering the off-side by dribbling on his own.

Olsen was a part of the Anderlecht team which beat Portuguese team Porto and Spanish team Valencia, among others, to reach the final game of the international 1982–83 UEFA Cup tournament. Anderlecht faced Portuguese team Benfica in the final, and won 2–1 on aggregate score. Olsen was subsequently named 1983 Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot;. Anderlecht also reached the 1983–84 UEFA Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur from England. Olsen scored a goal in the first leg, but missed his shot in the deciding penalty shoot-out which Tottenham won.

Aged 36 years old, Olsen left Anderlecht following the 1986 World Cup. He moved to Germany, to play for 1. FC Köln in the Bundesliga. While at Köln, Olsen was moved back to his previous defensive midfield position. He helped Köln reach third and second-place finishes in the 1987–88 and 1988–89 Bundesliga seasons respectively. Olsen played 80 games and scored two goals for Köln in the Bundesliga, before retiring from his active career in June 1989, 39 years of age.

===International career===
Olsen made his debut for the Denmark under-21 national team in September 1970, scoring a single goal in a 2–2 friendly match draw with the Poland U21 team. Three weeks later, he was called up for the senior Danish national team under the Austria national team manager Rudi Strittich, and Olsen made his national team debut in September 1970 against Norway. He played his first national team game as a right winger, but eventually settled as a defensive midfielder. He helped Denmark qualify for the 1972 Summer Olympics, but could not participate at the tournament, as he had signed a professional contract with Cercle Brugge beforehand.

While at Anderlecht, Olsen became the seventh Dane to play 50 games for the national team, in June 1981. For Olsen&#x27;s 53rd national team game in April 1983, the Germany national team manager of Denmark, Sepp Piontek, named Olsen permanent national team captain, as Olsen replaced the retiring Per Røntved as both libero and team captain. Olsen played as an attacking libero, and had defensive midfielder Jens Jørn Bertelsen cover for him when he was on the attack. Olsen, alongside defender Søren Busk, persuaded Piontek to implement the aggressive off-side trap they practiced at Anderlecht.

Olsen captained the Danish team that qualified for the 1984 European Championship; Denmark&#x27;s first international tournament participation since the 1972 Olympics. Denmark reached the semi-finals, before being eliminated by Spain in a penalty shootout. In October 1985, Olsen became the second Dane, after Per Røntved, to play 75 national team matches. He captained Denmark at the 1986 World Cup, Denmark&#x27;s first World Cup participation, which ended in a second round defeat to Spain. Olsen&#x27;s most noticeable effort at the tournament came in the 2–0 group stage win against West Germany. He took the ball from his own half and made an irresistible dribbling run that was only stopped by a foul in the West German penalty area, with Jesper Olsen scoring the 1–0 goal on the resulting penalty kick. Olsen was identified as one of the overall top performers at the World Cup, and he was subsequently named 1986 Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot;.

While he was moved to a midfielder position at Köln, Olsen continued to play as a libero for Denmark. He captained Denmark at the 1988 European Championship, which ended in the preliminary group stage. During the tournament, Olsen proved too slow for the libero position, and was moved up as defensive midfielder, leaving the libero position for Lars Olsen. Morten Olsen ended his international career following the 1988 European Championship, having played 99 national team games, but was called up again 10 months later. Olsen became the first Dane to play 100 games for the national team in April 1989, before ending his national team career in June 1989. Olsen played a record 102 games and scored four goals for the national team, and set a record of 50 games as Danish national team captain. His team captain record was broken by Lars Olsen in 1992, while his game tally was bested by Peter Schmeichel in 1998. In his entire international career, Morten Olsen only got one yellow card.

===Style of play===
Olsen played a wide variety of positions, including right winger, central midfielder, and libero. In his youth, Olsen&#x27;s strengths were his acceleration, agility, and play intelligence and he played as a winger. In his first senior years, Olsen played all positions except goalkeeper, maturing him into a versatile team-player. He eventually found his place as a central midfielder. Though initially filling the role of playmaker rather than a ball-winning tackler, Olsen eventually excelled as a defensive midfielder possessing great determination, dedicated professionalism, and organisational skills. He gradually took on a strong leadership role, a trait he worked hard to develop.

At the age of 32, Olsen was moved back to the libero position, which transformed him from an established player to an international star-player. Olsen employed a wide variety of skills for a defensive player, including attacking surges and technical dribbling, taking advantage of his acceleration and vision of the game. He provided long passes from his deep position, while his forward surges helped create numerical advantages in the midfield. He was a consummate professional, known as a gentleman of the game.

==Coaching career==
Olsen started his coaching career in January 1990, at the defending Danish champions Brøndby, and guided the club to two Danish championships. He put the team through tough fitness training which, even though it disgruntled some players, elevated the team into European top class, as Brøndby reached the semi-final of the 1990–91 UEFA Cup with Olsen at the helm. With the notable exception of Nigerian international defender Uche Okechukwu, his dabblings in the transfer market were not equally successful. This caused anger among the amateur department of the club, whose youth scheme they felt Olsen overlooked. As the club faced financial hardship and results began to lack in 1992, Olsen was fired from the club in May.

In April 1993, Olsen moved to his former team 1. FC Köln which he saved from relegation, when coming to its aid in the last six games of the 1992–93 Bundesliga season. In his time in Germany, he would become a certified coach, earning his &quot;Fußball-Lehrer-Lizenz&quot; diploma in 1993. For two seasons, he had the club positioned somewhat safely from relegation, despite not having any especially good players. At the start of the 1995–96 season, Köln were eliminated in the DFB-Pokal by an amateur team from Beckum, and Olsen was fired in August 1995.

He would have to wait for almost two years until Ajax in the Netherlands hired him on a contract starting from July 1997. He attracted Danish national team captain Michael Laudrup to the club, and together they won the Double of the Eredivisie championship and Dutch Cup trophy, as well as reaching the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup. In his second year at the club, tension arose in the Ajax dressing room, as Dutch internationals Ronald de Boer and Frank de Boer boycotted training in order to leave the club in favour of Barcelona. As results began to suffer, Olsen was sacked in December 1998.
In the fall of 1999, Olsen signed a two-year contract with the Danish Football Association (DBU) to manage the Danish national team, effective after Denmark&#x27;s participation at the 2000 European Championship. In July 2000, he replaced Swedish coach Bo Johansson as the manager of the Denmark national football team. As his assistant coach, Olsen chose Michael Laudrup. The duo guided Denmark to qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament, a campaign which ended in the round of 16 match against England in a 0–3 defeat after Denmark won the initial stage group. Prior to the 2002 World Cup, Olsen signed a new four-year contract until June 2006. When Laudrup went on to coach Brøndby, Olsen chose Keld Bordinggaard as his new assistant coach. With Bordinggaard, Olsen guided Denmark to the 2004 European Championship tournament, which once again ended at the first knock-out stage. Olsen failed to qualify Denmark for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but prolonged his contract with DBU in November 2005. A part of the new deal, which ran until and including the 2010 FIFA World Cup, was the added responsibility of defining a &quot;red thread&quot;, or common denominator, in the talent work of the Danish national youth teams, thus giving Olsen a large influence on the future football being played by Denmark.

In March 2008, Olsen stated that he would like to see Michael Laudrup succeed him as coach of the Danish national team. Olsen did not qualify Denmark for the 2008 European Championship, and in August 2008 Olsen stated that he planned to let his contract expire in 2010, in order to return to coaching on club level. On 10 October 2009 he coached his 100th match as national team coach, as Denmark won 1–0 against Sweden and qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In January 2010, Olsen extended his contract until and including the 2012 European Championship. On 13 December 2013, Olsen further extended his contract to stay on as national coach until June 2016. Denmark failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. &quot;Many of us are disappointed that we didn&#x27;t make it through this time after making the finals in the past two competitions,&quot; Olsen said in the press release. On 17 March 2015, Olsen stated that he would step down when his contract with Denmark ends, after the Euro, in 2016. However, his contract was mutually terminated immediately after the Danish national team failed to qualify for Euro 2016, beaten by Sweden 4–3 on aggregate on 17 November 2015. With 15 years of tenure, Morten Olsen is the longest-serving manager of Denmark.

==Personal life==
Morten Olsen has been married to his Belgian wife and lived in Beersel near Brussels. In addition to Danish he speaks also Dutch, German, French and English.

<text>Difficult to Cure is the fifth studio album by the British hard rock band Rainbow, and it was released in 1981. It was the first album to feature Bobby Rondinelli on drums and Joe Lynn Turner on lead vocals after the departures of Cozy Powell and Graham Bonnet respectively, following the release of &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. The album marked the continuing commercialization of the band&#x27;s sound, with Ritchie Blackmore once describing at the time his appreciation of the band Foreigner. It became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at number three.

==Recording==
Writing of the album&#x27;s material was begun with singer Graham Bonnet still in the band, progressing as far as recording an early version of &quot;I Surrender&quot;, before Bonnet left the band due to his dissatisfaction over the material, and numerous fallouts with Blackmore. American singer Joe Lynn Turner, formerly of Fandango was recruited and sang over already completed musical tracks. Turner stated that, because of this, he was singing in higher keys than he would do normally (and would do subsequently).

==Release==
Allegedly, the album&#x27;s cover (designed by Hipgnosis) had originally been proposed for use on Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1978 release &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;.
&quot;I Surrender&quot; would be the band&#x27;s highest charting single in the UK, reaching No. 3.

The original 1981 LP and cassette releases had the title of the fifth track as &quot;Vielleicht das Nachster Zeit (Maybe Next Time)&quot;. This was a mistranslation from the German, which was corrected on later releases. However, the &quot;corrected&quot; version still is not perfectly grammatical, as the correct German for &quot;Maybe Next Time&quot; is &quot;Vielleicht beim nächsten Mal&quot;.

The laughter at the end of the last track is a sample of Oliver Hardy. On the original LP, the laughter is an endless loop as it plays in the run-out groove, while on CD it loops a few times before fading out.

A remastered CD reissue was released in May 1999, with packaging duplicating the original vinyl release.

<text>Swami Madhavananda (born Nirmal Chandra Basu; 15 December 1888 – 6 October 1965) was the ninth President of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. He was born in the Bengal Presidency of British India.

== Biography ==
Madhavananda was born into a family of Hariprasad Basu in Baganchra, Nadia district. He was originally named Nirmal Chandra Basu. 

Madhavananda graduated from the University of Calcutta with honours. During his academic years, he extensively studied the works of Vivekananda and found inspiration in the ideals and teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. He received initiation from the Holy Mother at Jayrambati in March 1909 and subsequently joined the monastery in Chennai in January 1910. In January 1916, Madhavananda was formally initiated into sannyasa by Swami Brahmananda. Later, his younger brother Vimal joined the Order, adopting the name Swami Dayananda. Swami Dayananda established the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan in Kolkata in 1932.

Following this, Madhavananda spent several years at the Udbodhan office, where he contributed to the publication of the journal. Subsequently, he was appointed as the head of the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati. There, he initiated the publication of a Hindi-language periodical called Samanvaya, with the assistance of the Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi, &#x27;Nirala&#x27;. Madhavananda played a significant role in promoting the teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda in Gujarat and in establishing the Rajkot Center. Additionally, he was assigned to the United States to deliver lectures at the San Francisco monastery.

Madhavananda was appointed as a trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and became a member of the governing body of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1922. He returned to India in 1929 to serve as a Joint Secretary of the Order. In May 1938, he was appointed General Secretary, a position he held for 24 years until his appointment as Vice President in March 1962. Following the passing of Vishuddhananda, Madhavananda assumed the role of President of the Order on 4 August 1962. During his tenure as President, he presided over the Birth Centenary Celebrations of Vivekananda in 1963.

Madhavananda was known for his austere lifestyle and devoted practice of japa and meditation for extended periods. He translated various scriptures, including the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhasha Pariccheda.

<text>The River Coln is a river in Gloucestershire, England. It rises to the north of Brockhampton, a village to the east of Cheltenham, and flows in a south/south-easterly direction through the Cotswold Hills via Andoversford, Withington, Fossebridge, Bibury, Coln St Aldwyns, Quenington and Fairford. It joins the River Thames to the south-west of Lechlade, near to the confluence with the Thames and Severn Canal.

Midway between Withington and Fossbridge the river passes Chedworth Roman Villa.

Extensive gravel pits between Fairford and Lechlade, now redundant, have been flooded to form the eastern component of the Cotswold Water Park. They are fed and drained by the Coln.

The river is host to many species of freshwater fish including brown trout and grayling.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<doc id="1322683" wikidata="Q1194400" url="?curid=1322683" title="April 9 tragedy">
<text>April 9 Tragedy (also known as the massacre of Tbilisi or Tbilisi tragedy) refers to the events in Tbilisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, on April 9, 1989, when an anti-Soviet, pro-independence demonstration was crushed by the Soviet Army, resulting in 21 deaths and hundreds of injuries. April 9 is now remembered as the National Unity Day (), an annual public holiday.

==Prelude==
In the Georgian SSR, the anti-Soviet movement grew more active in 1988. Political groups opposed to the Soviet Union organized a number of protests and gatherings in Tbilisi. The conflict between the Soviet government and Georgian nationalists deepened after the so-called Lykhny Assembly on March 18, 1989, when several thousand Abkhaz demanded secession from Georgia and restoration of the Union republic status of 1921–1931. In response, the anti-Soviet groups organized a series of unsanctioned meetings across the republic, claiming that the Soviet government was using Abkhaz separatism in order to oppose the pro-independence movement.

The protests reached their peak on April 4, 1989, when tens of thousands of Georgians gathered before the House of Government on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. The protesters, led by the Independence Committee (Merab Kostava, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Giorgi Chanturia, Irakli Bathiashvili, Irakli Tsereteli and others) organized a peaceful demonstration and hunger strikes, demanding the punishment of Abkhaz secessionists and restoration of Georgian independence.

Local Soviet authorities lost control over the situation in the capital and were unable to contain the protests. First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Jumber Patiashvili asked USSR leadership to send troops to restore order and impose curfew.

==The demonstrations==
In the evening of April 8, 1989, Colonel General Igor Rodionov, Commander of the Transcaucasus Military District, ordered his troops to mobilize. Moments before the attack by the Soviet forces, the Patriarch of Georgia Ilia II addressed the demonstrators asking them to leave Rustaveli Avenue and the vicinity of the government building due to the danger which accumulated during the day after appearance of Soviet tanks near the avenue. The demonstrators refused to disband even after the Patriarch&#x27;s plea. The local Georgian militsiya (police) units were disarmed just before the operation.

On April 9, at 3:45 a.m., Soviet APCs and troops under General Igor Rodionov surrounded the demonstration area. Later, Rodionov claimed in his interview that groups of Georgian militants attacked unarmed soldiers with stones, metal chains and rods. The Soviet troops received an order from General Rodionov to disband and clear the avenue of demonstrators by any means necessary.

The Soviet detachment, armed with military batons and spades (a favorite weapon of Soviet special forces), advanced on demonstrators moving along Rustaveli Avenue. During the advance, the soldiers started to attack demonstrators with spades, inflicting injuries both minor and serious to anyone who was struck.

One of the victims of the attack was a 16-year-old girl who tried to get away from the advancing soldiers, but was chased down and beaten to death near the steps of the government building, receiving blows to the head and chest. She was dragged out of the area by her mother, who was also attacked and wounded. This particularly violent attack was recorded on video from the balcony of a building located on the other side of the avenue. The video was used in the aftermath as evidence during Soviet politician Anatoly Sobchak&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary commission on investigation of events of April 9, 1989&quot;. Groups of Soviet soldiers were reported to chase individual victims, rather than dispersing the crowd.

CN and CS gas were used against the demonstrators; vomiting, respiratory problems and sudden paralyses of the nervous system were reported.

The unarmed police officers attempted to evacuate the panicked group of demonstrators, however a video taken secretly by opposition journalists showed that soldiers did not allow doctors and emergency workers to help the injured people; even ambulances were attacked by the advancing soldiers Captured on film, the image of a young man beating a tank with a stick became a symbol of the Georgian anti-Soviet movement.

== Victims ==
The stampede as people fled from the attack resulted in the death of 19 people, among them 17 women. Autopsies conducted on the victims concluded the direct cause of death of all those who died, with 
the exception of one case of serious skull and brain injury, was suffocation (asphyxia) caused by both the compression of the body and the inhalation of chemical substances.

On April 11, The Georgian TV showed the bodies of the 17 women violently killed, demonstrating alleged brutality by the Soviet soldiers, as the faces of the deceased women were hard to identify due to the facial injuries and blows to the head. The Soviet government blamed the demonstrators for the death of the 20 people, claiming that they had trampled each other while panicking and retreating from the advancing Soviet soldiers. Ironically there was some truth in this, as Soviet troops had blocked all exits from the area except for one narrow passage, which made flight from the area difficult and induced a crowd crush and, possibly, some desperate defensive violence by the trapped demonstrators.

== Investigative reports ==
Official Soviet reports blamed the demonstrators for causing the clash, saying that the troops were attacked with sticks and knives. According to Tass, the soldiers followed orders not to use their weapons, but that extremists attacked them with pieces of metal, bricks and sticks. Tass described the demonstrators as stirring interethnic strife and calling for the overthrow of the Georgian government. General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev slammed &quot;actions by irresponsible persons&quot; for loss of life. He said that the disturbances sought to overthrow the Georgian government and stir ethnic tension in Georgia. A foreign ministry spokesman said that the clashes were sparked by &quot;die-hard nationalists, extremists and political adventurists who are abusing democratization to the detriment of our new policy of openness and of our very society.&quot;

A parliamentary commission on investigation of the events of April 9, 1989, in Tbilisi was launched by Anatoly Sobchak, a member of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of Soviet Union. After full investigation and inquiries, the commission confirmed the government&#x27;s claim that the deaths had resulted from trampling, but another contributing factor had been the chemical substances used against the demonstrators. It condemned the military, which had caused the deaths by trying to disperse demonstrators. The commission&#x27;s report made it more difficult to use military power against demonstrations of civil unrest in the Soviet Union. Sobchak&#x27;s report presented a detailed account of the violence which was used against the demonstrators and recommended the full prosecution of military personnel responsible for the April 9 event.

== Response ==
On April 10, the Soviet government issued a statement blaming the demonstrators for causing unrest and danger to the safety of the public.

On April 10, in protest against the crackdown, Tbilisi and the rest of Georgia went out on strike and a 40-day period of mourning was declared. People brought massive collections of flowers to the place of the killings. A state of emergency was declared, but demonstrations continued.

The government of the Georgian SSR resigned as a result of the event. Moscow claimed the demonstrators attacked first and the soldiers had to repel them. At the first Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies (May–June 1989) Mikhail Gorbachev disclaimed all responsibility, shifting blame onto the army. The revelations in the liberal Soviet media, as well as the findings of the &quot;pro-Perestroika&quot; Deputy Anatoly Sobchak&#x27;s commission of enquiry into the Tbilisi events, reported at the second Congress in December 1989, resulted in embarrassment for the Soviet hardliners and army leadership implicated in the event.

==Legacy==

The April 9 tragedy radicalised Georgian opposition to Soviet power. A few months later, a session of the Supreme Council of Georgian SSR, held on November 17–18, 1989, officially condemned the occupation and annexation of Democratic Republic of Georgia by Soviet Russia in 1921.

The events of April 9 also gave rise to the so-called &#x27;Tbilisi Syndrome&#x27;. This syndrome was characterized by the reluctance of military officers and soldiers to take any tactical decisions or even obey orders without a clear trail of responsibility to a higher authority. It arose because of the Soviet leadership&#x27;s refusal to take responsibility for the orders to clear the square and the commission report&#x27;s and Shevardnadze&#x27;s criticism of the military in general. &#x27;Tbilisi Syndrome&#x27; continued to spread in the coming years, especially following events in Baku and Vilnius, and contributed in 1991 to the refusal of soldiers to prevent demonstrations during the August 1991 putsch.

On March 31, 1991, Georgians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence from the Soviet Union in a referendum. With a 90.5% turnout, approximately 99% voted in favor of independence. On April 9, the second anniversary of the tragedy, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia proclaimed Georgian sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union.

A memorial to the victims of the tragedy was opened at the location of the crackdown on Rustaveli Avenue on November 23, 2004.

<text>Igor Nikolayevich Rodionov (; 1 December 1936 – 19 December 2014) was a Russian general and Duma deputy. He is best known as a hardline politician, and for his service heading the Defence Ministry of the Russian Federation.

Rodionov served as a Soviet Army officer in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, the Far East and several other areas around the world. Then-Major Rodionov commanded a motorized rifle regiment in the famed 24th Motorized Rifle Division (the &quot;Iron Division&quot;) in the Carpathian Military District from 1970 to 1973, and later commanded the 17th Motor Rifle Division in the same District. He commanded the 5th Army in the Far East Military District from 1983 to 1985 and then the key 40th Army in Afghanistan in 1985–1986. He held the post of First Deputy Chief Commander of the Moscow Military District from 1986 until 1988, when Colonel General Rodionov was appointed Commander of the Transcaucasus Military District.

Rodionov was held responsible for the violent repression of demonstrations in April 1989 during the April 9 protests in Tbilisi, during which 19 people were killed and hundreds injured. He was removed from his post and assigned to the General Staff Academy, which was one of the traditional Soviet dumping grounds for those who fell out of favor. However, Based on Rodionov&#x27;s politics, personality, career roster, and consistent opposition to the use of army troops in the city, there is good reason to believe that he served as a scapegoat for the events. The Sobchak commission investigating the tragedy established the orders to clear the demonstrators originated from Defence Minister Yazov, at the request of Republican level Communist Party officials. Yazov and Rodionov were personal enemies and laying the blame on him was convenient for the Politburo generally and Yazov personally. The deaths themselves were the result of the units involved treating it as &quot;military operation&quot; which &quot;was not corrected in accordance with the actual situation&quot; (the number of protesters present far exceeded what was expected). The soldiers deployed, especially the VDV unit, where not equipped or trained for controlling civil disturbances and the operation was poorly planned.

From 1989 to 1996, he served as a People&#x27;s Deputy and as the head of the General Staff Academy.

In the leadup to the 1996 presidential election, Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and replaced him with Rodionov. Rodionov had had many military doctrinal articles published, and coming from command of the General Staff Academy had a background in analysis which Grachev lacked. During Rodionov&#x27;s term the major factors obstructing Armed Forces reform were mainly political.

Rodionov did have ideas for reforming the armed forces, but thought that the general outlook of the Cold War ought to remain; Russia had been and would continue to be an adversary of the West, and the threat perception and budget levels should be designed on that basis. Over the course of his tenure as defence minister, he changed his mind over whether the Armed Forces should be restructured to Russia&#x27;s new circumstances, or whether Russia should continue, in the Soviet style, to place the military above social and economic needs. At the start of his term, he appeared to be convinced of fitting the Army to the state; eventually he was dismissed because he would not forswear fitting the state to the Army. His attitude was revealed in comments such as &#x27;it is ... impermissible to solve society&#x27;s ... problems at the cost of lowering the state&#x27;s main attribute, the army&#x27;.

Rodionov was eventually dismissed for two reasons. First, he had refused to subordinate the Ministry to civilian control in the form of the short-lived Defence Council. Secondly, he had had a major dispute with Yuriy Baturin, of the Defence Council, over whether reform was possible within the budgetary resources the state had available. Rodionov insisted it was not, and much more money would have to be spent; Baturin argued that the military would have to make do with the then current spending levels, as increases were fiscally impossible. Neither man would give up his position, and reform was not being achieved, so Yeltsin solved the problem by firing Rodionov.

A State Duma member (Movement in Support of the Army and Rodina faction) since 1999, Igor Rodionov was a member of the Committee on National Security and Chairman of the Professional Union of Military Personnel. Upon his death, he was laid to rest at the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery in Moscow Oblast.

<text>Pedro Eleodoro Paulet Mostajo (2 July 1874 or 4 July 1875 – 30 January 1945) was a Peruvian diplomat and engineer. Some early rocket experts described him as a pioneer in aeronautics, saying that he was the first person to build a liquid-propellant rocket engine and modern rocket propulsion system, but his experiments were never independently verified.

==Early life and education==
Pedro Eleodoro Paulet Mostajo was born on 2 July 1874, to the well-esteemed family of Pedro Paulet and Antonia Mostajo y Quiroz in Tiabaya, Arequipa, Peru; his father died three years later. As a child, Paulet was fascinated with flight and combustion. With the steam locomotives traveling through Arequipa, Paulet would try to learn how the large machines were propelled as a child. He was sent to the San Vicente de Paul School by his mother, with the school being founded by the Lazarist French priest Hippolyte Duhamel. After Duhamel gifted Paulet the 1865 French novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, an inspired Paulet would reportedly launch homemade rockets as a youth. His family reported that Paulet would make rockets by using leftover gunpowder from festivals, filling reeds coated with wax from his family&#x27;s candles with the gunpowder and then tying it together with hemp string. Sometimes he would tie the rockets to stones or pieces of metal to gauge their strength or have the rockets travel with live animals placed inside, observing the effects rocket travel had on them. Despite being scolded by his family due to bothering his neighborhood, Paulet would instead go to open fields where he would experiment on his own.

By the age of fifteen, Paulet would begin to work with local pyrotechnicians, working with them to larger rockets with longer burn times. He enrolled at the National University of Saint Augustine when he was seventeen, founding the Patriotic Society and the Artistic Center. Paulet would show interest in the arts, being recognized as a skilled sculptor and painter, winning awards for his work. He would and Paulet would graduate with a Bachelor of Science and Arts. In late 1893, Paulet&#x27;s mother would die. Despite his interests in the arts, Paulet would continue to be fixated on the power of rockets and how they could be used for transportation.

President Remigio Morales Bermúdez, who was personally impressed by the intellect of Paulet, provided a scholarship to him in 1894 to begin studies for a degree in engineering and architecture at the University of Paris. In 1895, Paulet reportedly began to experiment with his rocket engine, using Panclastite for propulsion, as recommended by Marcellin Berthelot. When experimenting with combustible chemicals, Paulet reported he had to do so in secret due to prohibitions enforced by the police due to anarchist attacks in Paris. In one incident, he ruptured the eardrum in his left ear due to an explosion and was temporarily arrested upon suspicions of being an anarchist, though Berthelot was able to explain that Paulet was a student. After explosive experiments were prohibited in university laboratories, Paulet was forced to perform experiments in the outskirts of Paris, seeking to find a cheaper and safer alternatives for fueling rockets. In 1897, he became a member of the Société astronomique de France and reportedly began to experiment with the &quot;Girándula Motriz&quot;, or &quot;Power Gyro&quot;. The same year, he reportedly made a more stable rocket engine fueled by nitrogen peroxide and gasoline. Due to the use of an oxidizing agent, the engine would have had the ability to function in the vacuum environment of outer space where oxygen is not present for combustion.

Due to his fluency in English, French, German and Spanish, he served as a correspondent for various newspapers, including &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;La Petite République&quot;. With these funds, Paulet was able to continue his studies and to travel to Northern Africa, the Middle East, Russia and the United States in search of ideas on rocketry. In 1898, Paulet began his studies of industrial engineering at the Institute of Applied Chemistry at the University of Paris. While attending the university, he would study under Charles Friedel, Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, exchanging ideas with them on the best methods to provide rocket propulsion. Due to funding issues, loss of laboratory access and concerns with neighbors, Paulet ceased his experiments.

During the Exposition Universelle in 1900, Paulet would serve as the Deputy Commissioner for the Peruvian delegation, designing the pavilion used at the exposition. He would become a member of the Société chimique de France and be bestowed the title of &quot;Officier de l&#x27;Instruction Publique&quot; of the &quot;Ordre des Palmes académiques&quot; by France the same year. The Peruvian government would also commission to create a plan to bring wireless telegraphy to Peruvian Amazonia in 1900, with his recommendations being utilized during the project. In 1901, he would graduate with High Distinction in industrial engineering from the University of Paris. 

==Career==

=== Diplomatic work ===

Paulet first served as chancellor of the Consulate of Peru in Paris. He was named as the Peruvian Counsel in Antwerp in 1902, and served in the role for a few years. Paulet designed a liquid-fueled &quot;rocket engine&quot; for the Avión Torpedo aircraft, with the proposal being in complete contrast to the intellectual interest in gunpowder rockets at the time. He would spend decades seeking funds for the project, though he ultimately did not find donors.

In 1904, he became the first director of the Escuela Nacional de Artes y Oficios, later known as the Instituto Superior Tecnológico Público José Pardo, after returning to Peru. He would review European institutions to develop a curriculum and purchase equipment for the school. President José Pardo y Barreda would also task Paulet with constructing the Goyeneche Hospital, directing the &quot;El Peruano&quot; newspaper and reviewing new ships for the Peruvian Navy. He wrote about a proposed military submarine in September 1909. Encouraging Minister of War Pedro Muñíz to create an aviation organization after observing the feats of aircraft in Europe, Paulet would help found the National Pro-Aviation League, which would later be developed into the Peruvian Air Force. Paulet would provide a framework to head of the National Pro-Aviation League, Juan Bielovucic, focusing on providing aircraft to defend Peru.

After knowing that he would not attain his dream of making a space vehicle while living in Peru, he decided to return to Europe. Leaving Peru in 1910, Paulet married Louise Constance Wilquet Genion, in Brussels after returning to Europe to serve as the Counsel of Peru in Amsterdam. Paulet and Louise would later have seven children together; Margarita, José, Héctor, Pedro, Cecilia, Luis and Megan. During World War I, Paulet would mainly live in Paris and the health of his family would struggle due to the war, with two of his children, Margarita and José, dying due to ailments. 

The Paulet family would move to London in 1920 following the deaths of their children in an effort to recover from the tragedy, with Paulet opening a successful toy factory with funding from friends. President Augusto B. Leguía would then appoint him as the counsel in Dresden, Germany in 1921, with Louise selling all the family&#x27;s shares for the you company. He would be moved to Amsterdam in 1923 and a year later in 1924, he was named the Counsel of Peru in Stavanger and Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Oslo.

===Rocketry work===
Paulet&#x27;s work was unknown prior to 27 October 1927, when the Peruvian newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot; published a letter he wrote, in which he said that he conceived a &quot;rocket airplane project&quot; nearly 30 years prior. Paulet said that his rocket motor was made of vanadium, weighed 2.5 kilos, was fueled by nitrogen peroxide and gasoline, which produced three hundred explosions per minute and had ninety kilograms of thrust.

Replying to comments in 1927 by Austrian inventor Max Valier discussing a rocket powered aircraft crossing the Atlantic Ocean faster than Charles Lindbergh, Paulet – the Peruvian counsel in Rotterdam at the time – criticized Valier&#x27;s proposal and recommended an aircraft powered by liquid-propellant rockets, stating that he had made plans for a rocket-propelled aircraft thirty years prior. Paulet&#x27;s recommendation occurred at a time when news of Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s 1926 liquid-propellant rocket launch was not notable, details about Goddard&#x27;s work had not reached Europe and in fact, no liquid-propelled rockets had been launched yet in Europe. A unique feature of Paulet&#x27;s rocket design was its difference from Goddard&#x27;s; unlike Goddard&#x27;s rocket, Paulet&#x27;s rocket utilized an intermittent fuel injection process that provided more efficiency and stability. Paulet&#x27;s description of past experiments would have made him the first person to create a liquid-propelled rocket, nearly three decades ahead of Goddard. Paulet stated that his experiments were &quot;made, truly, without witnesses&quot; and called on former classmates to defend his work.

According to the Paulet family, American businessman Henry Ford would also contact Paulet to discuss purchasing his inventions as rocket cars were popular at the time, though Paulet would refuse as he wanted to continue to pursue spaceflight. Visiting the German rocket association Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR), Paulet&#x27;s liquid-propelled rocket design was applauded by Valier for its strength. The VfR would use Paulet&#x27;s research throughout their publications in Germany and he would finally gain interest in his work from Nazi Germany. The Astronomische Gesellschaft invited Paulet to join the society in order to progress research in rocketry, though once he discovered that the program was primarily for a weapon, he refused to work with the government and never shared the formula to his liquid propellant.

=== Later life ===
In 1929, he was named Counsel General of Peru in Rotterdam and would continue work on his rocket designs with two Dutch engineers; Hans Doerr and a man named Philip. Into the 1930s, Paulet promoted the development of Peru on the international stage, publishing an outline on how Germans could migrate to the nation and assist with its development. He would continue to experiment on aircraft designs, formulating ideas of thermoelectric generators being placed on the exterior aircraft in 1930, focusing on the temperature difference between the cold exterior in the stratosphere and the warm interior of the vehicle. In 1932, he was named Counsel General in Yokohama where he would write &quot;Modern Japan and its Economic Bases&quot;.

He would return to Peru in 1935 with his family, all except for his oldest child Hector who had married a woman in Japan, with Paulet helping with the creation of the Commercial Department of the Chancellery. He sought funding for creating a jet engine in Peru and the United Kingdom, although he was unsuccessful. Paulet would be named Counsel General in Buenos Aires in 1941. When Peru broke diplomatic relations with Japan during World War II, Paulet&#x27;s engine was lost while in transit between Japan and Peru. In 1944, Paulet stated that his rocket could fly up to 600 miles per hour in the outer atmosphere. 

Towards the end of his life, Paulet would experience tinnitus and dizziness due to previous damage to his ears, causing him great stress. On 30 January 1945, upon receiving a telegram from Peru saying that he had reached the age limit of his diplomatic service, Paulet became upset and died of cardiac arrest in Buenos Aires, Argentina; he was found still clutching the telegram according to Ambassador Jacinto Rada.

== Veracity ==

Paulet&#x27;s work was accepted by some prominent experts in rocketry, but it was not independently verified. Russian aviation writer Aleksander B. Sherschevsky supported Paulet, saying &quot;The advent of the space age became a reality with the development of the propulsion engine and spacecraft designed and built by the Peruvian Pedro Paulet between 1899 and 1903.&quot; Max Valier stated that Paulet&#x27;s rocket engine had &quot;amazing power&quot; and that &quot;the work of the Peruvian Paulet is most important for present projects leading to rocket ships, for it proved for the first time, in contrast to powder rockets burning only a few seconds, that by using liquid propellants, the construction of a rocket motor functioning for periods of hours would be feasible.&quot; Some of the principal founders of NASA recognized Paulet as an inspiration according to BBC News. In 1965, Hermann Oberth would describe Paulet as a pioneer in rocketry. Frederick I. Ordway III and Wernher von Braun studied the veracity of Paulet&#x27;s work during the 1960s. Von Braun wrote that Paulet &quot;is reputed to have experimented with a small, 5-pound rocket motor between 1895 and 1897&quot;, though von Braun noted that Paulet &quot;would probably have gone unnoticed&quot; without Scherschevsky&#x27;s support.

James H. Wyld would state that &quot;the validity of his claim may be rather doubtful, but it is interesting, nevertheless, ... Paulet&#x27;s device appears to have been the earliest example of a so-called bipropellant rocket motor ... His use of nitrogen peroxide as oxidizer also foreshadowed certain modern propellants such as nitric acid, and the set-up of his test stand was quite similar to types used in later years.&quot; German science writer Willy Ley was one of the first people to express skepticism of Paulet and stated that &quot;The doubts are obviously correct&quot; in &quot;Grundriss einer Geschichte der Rakete&quot;, strongly criticizing Scherschevsky, calling him &quot;lazy by nature&quot; and &quot;in favor of the Soviet government&quot;, stating that he &quot;uncritically put hearsay into some of his articles, and into his one and only book.&quot; Liquid propellant chemist John D. Clark also raised doubts about Paulet&#x27;s nineteenth century experiments. 

&quot;El Comercio&quot; published several artist&#x27;s interpretations of the Paulet&#x27;s designs on 10 March 1965, in the article &quot;A Peruvian Engineer is the World Forerunner of Jet Propulsion Aircraft&quot;. Another article by &quot;El Comercio&quot; on 12 December cited Manuel del Castillo, president of the Organismo Nacional de Investigacions Espaciales, said to prove Paulet&#x27;s work, citing Wyld June 1947 article, while admitting Wyld was simply translating A. B. Scherschevsky&#x27;s &quot;Die Rakete für Fahrt und Flug&quot;. Noting that Paulet did not publish an account of his work until 1927 in the Lima newspaper, Wyld reiterated that &quot;the validity of his [Paulet] claim is rather doubtful.&quot;

==Legacy==

A statue of Paulet is present in his home district of Tiabaya and in the Parque Domodossola of the Malecón de Miraflores. In 1995, the Peruvian Air Force constructs a mausoleum for Paulet at the Cementerio Presbítero Matías Maestro. Paulet&#x27;s Avión Torpedo was featured in a Google Doodle to commemorate the birthday of Pedro Paulet in 2011. In Peru, the National Commission for Aerospace Research and Development launched a series of rockets bearing Paulet&#x27;s name. Beginning in 2016, he was prominently featured on the 100 soles banknote of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol.

<text>Cruden Bay is a small village in Scotland, on the north coast of the Bay of Cruden in Aberdeenshire, north of Aberdeen.

Just west of Slains Castle, Cruden Bay is said to have been the site of a battle in which the Scots under King Malcolm II defeated the Danes in 1012. Traditionally, the name was derived from the Gaelic (&#x27;slaughter of Danes&#x27;).

Today, Cruden Bay attracts tourists with its hotels and golf course. It has a long, unspoiled, beach made famous by Norwegian aviator Tryggve Gran who made the first solo flight across the North Sea.

==Literary associations==

The village has associations with various figures in literature.

Dr Samuel Johnson and James Boswell were guests at Slains Castle in 1773. Johnson said that &quot;no man can see with indifference&quot; the sea chasm known as the Bullers of Buchan, which is near the village.

Dun Bay, or Yellow Rock is also near the Bullers of Buchan, and is associated with Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Antiquary&quot;.

Bram Stoker was a regular visitor between 1892 and 1910. An article in the &quot;Buchan Observer&quot; from 1897 discusses how he discovered the village:Cruden has an enthusiastic friend in Mr Bram Stoker, Sir Henry Irving’s manager. Mr Stoker (says a London correspondent), made the acquaintance of the district – as he tells me – by accident. He wanted to find a bracing place far north on the east coast. From a large ordnance map and the geological formations, he knew that some such place must lie between Peterhead and Aberdeen.

Accordingly, he went to Peterhead and walked down the coast, and when he saw Cruden he telegraphed to his family to come on to the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel. Mr Stoker has been there every summer since then, and hopes some day to have at Cruden his own &quot;pied-à-terre&quot;.Because he was a part-time writer, his Cruden Bay holidays provided him with the largest amount of spare time to write his books. He stayed at the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel in 1892 and 1894, and thereafter in cottages in Cruden Bay and Whinnyfold. The early chapters of Dracula were written in Cruden Bay, and possibly most of the rest of it was too. He also set two novels in and around the village, The Watter&#x27;s Mou&#x27; (1895) and The Mystery of the Sea (1902).

James Macpherson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Highlander&quot; (1758) takes the battle of Cruden as its model.

==Early area history==

Earliest nearby human traces are evident in nearby Catto Long Barrow, a massive stone structure now surrounded by agricultural fields.

The nearby cliff top Slains Castle was begun in 1597 and partly demolished in the 1920s. Bishop&#x27;s Bridge spans Cruden Water and dates from 1697.

William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll, established the fishing community of Port Erroll in the 1840s and 1850s. A functional harbour at the mouth of the Water of Cruden was added in the 1870s. Before that a tiny, long-abandoned hamlet of rudimentary fisher cottages, simply known as Ward, stood exposed on top of Ward Hill, just above the harbour site. There was also a parish school since 1606, housed in the two-storey Erroll Schoolhouse from 1834; the Presbyterian Church dedicated to Saint Olaf or commonly called the Old Kirk—built in 1776, with distinctive conical towers added in 1833—and Saint James Episcopal Church, notably the first structure designed by architect William Hay on top of Chapel Hill in 1842.

==Fishing community and seaside resort==

Port Erroll developed as a fishing community to some extent but the tidal nature of the harbour restricted the size of craft which could operate from it and the village missed out on the herring boom. Tourism provided another source of income for the village. Even before the coming of the railway, the long pink curve of the Bay of Cruden sands and scenic cliffscapes to the north were attracting visitors and a small seaside resort was grafting itself onto the fishing community. The Cruden Bay Golfing Society, founded in 1791, played on the open links.

==The coming and going of the railway==
The railway brought grandeur but not lasting prosperity, to Cruden Bay. The Boddam branch line from Ellon to Boddam near Peterhead was opened in 1897, along with the golf course and the 55-bedroom Cruden Bay Hotel two years later. The Cruden Bay Hotel Tramway was added linking the station and hotel. The Great North of Scotland Railway Company promoted Cruden Bay as a Brighton of the North, only twelve hours from London and an ideal escape for gentry and &quot;nouveau riche&quot;; despite initial enthusiasm, neither railway nor hotel prospered. The railway was closed to passengers in 1932 and in 1939 the hotel was requisitioned as an army hospital and not re-opened after the war and demolished around 1950. Cruden Bay remains a golfing destination and the village sustains three smaller hotels. Although the harbour area and the local primary school are still styled &quot;Port Errol&quot;, the railway adventure put the name Cruden Bay firmly on the map.

==Cruden Bay today==
The 1950s and 1960s was a period of rapid population decline for Cruden Bay but the coming of North Sea oil to north-east Scotland, with its attendant jobs and families looking for places to settle, reinvigorated the village; thereafter, the population rose again, with new housing added near the defunct brickworks, the site of the demolished Cruden Bay Hotel and along the water of Cruden at Morrison Place. These days Cruden Bay serves mainly as a dormitory village for the important settlements of Peterhead to the north and Aberdeen to the south. The eighteenth century timbered salmon station still operates and some seasonal commercial fishing continues. 

Cruden Bay has a medium-sized primary school. Secondary pupils are bussed to nearby Peterhead Academy. There are a few small shops, a chemist/newsagent, a post office/hardware, a craft shop and a general store. There is also a Chinese takeaway, a medical surgery and a library. There are also many sports facilities, tennis courts, and two football pitches. The school and public hall house a number of youth groups such as Girlguiding UK. There is a Congregational Church in the village centre and just outside the village there is a Scottish Episcopalian Church and a Church of Scotland parish. Cruden Bay is not far from the towns of Ellon and Peterhead, and is about 30 minutes drive from Aberdeen City. 

Holiday makers are served by 2 hotels, a pub and bed and breakfasts. Attractions for visitors include the beach, the golf course of the Cruden Bay Golf Club (ranked #29 nationwide).

==Oil pipeline==
Although there is little evidence of its presence other than a small complex a few miles south of the village, the sands at Cruden Bay is the place where the long Forties pipeline operated by Ineos, in use from 1975, finds landfall. It pumps crude oil from the Forties oilfield to Whinnyfold, then by overland pipeline to Grangemouth.

<doc id="1322733" wikidata="Q734004" url="?curid=1322733" title="Black January">
<text>Black January (), also known as Black Saturday or the January Massacre, was a violent crackdown on Azerbaijani nationalism and anti-Soviet sentiment in Baku on 19–20 January 1990, as part of a state of emergency during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev and Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov asserted that military law was necessary to thwart efforts by the Azerbaijani independence movement to overthrow the Soviet Azerbaijani government. According to official estimates of Azerbaijan, 147 civilians were killed, 800 people were injured, and five people went missing.

In a resolution of 22 January 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR declared that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 19 January, used to impose emergency rule in Baku and military deployment, constituted an act of aggression.

==Events==
In December 1989, Azerbaijanis living in regions bordering Iran ripped down border fences, demanding closer ties with ethnic Azerbaijanis living in Iran. The local authorities in Jalilabad surrendered to rioters, turning over administration to the Popular Front of Azerbaijan. This was followed by a non-violent turnover of the Lankaran administration to the Popular Front two weeks later.

On 9 January 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR voted to include Nagorno-Karabakh in its budget and allowed its inhabitants to vote in Armenian elections, thus disregarding Soviet authority and Azerbaijani SSR jurisdiction, and causing outrage throughout the republic. This led to demonstrations which demanded the ousting of Azerbaijani communist officials and called for independence from the Soviet Union. Their rhetoric was, according to a Human Rights Watch report, &quot;heavily anti-Armenian&quot;. On 12 January, the Popular Front organized a national defence committee with branches in factories and offices in Baku. The aim was to mobilize the population for battle with local Armenians.
Local Azerbaijani authorities were unable to restore order because of internal quarrelling and divisions that paralyzed their ability to act. Azerbaijani authorities also ordered the 12,000-strong Interior Ministry troops to abstain from intervening in the Baku riots and numerous Soviet army and fleet units of the Baku garrison and Caspian Flotilla did not intervene to stop the riots, claiming that they had no orders from Moscow authorities. On 13 January, anti-Armenian pogrom began in Baku which resulted in 48 deaths, while thousands fled or were evacuated by the Soviet military.

On 15 January, the authorities declared a state of emergency in several parts of Azerbaijan, except Baku. At the same time, fearing an intervention of the central Soviet authorities, Popular Front activists began a blockade of military barracks. They had already taken &quot;de facto&quot; control in a number of Azerbaijani regions.

On 18 January, the Popular Front ordered supporters to barricade the main access routes into Baku using hundreds of cars, trucks, and buses. The next day, Soviet authorities evacuated its representatives and local officials, moving them to military command posts in the outskirts of the city where Soviet Minister of Defence Dmitry Yazov and Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin were positioned.

On 19 January, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved the decree signed by M. Gorbachev, introducing a state of emergency in Baku and some other places in the Azerbaijani SSR. The decree stated:

In connection with a dramatic escalation of the situation in the city of Baku, attempts of criminal extremist forces to remove from power by organizing mass unrest legally acting state authorities and in the interests of the protection and security of citizens, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, guided by point 14 of the article 119 of the Constitution of the USSR, decrees: To declare since 20 January 1990 state of emergency in the city of Baku, by extending to its territory the effect of the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 15 January 1990.

The decree contravened legal acts in force at the time, which provided that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the AzSSR would have to turn to the central government with the relevant plea.

Late at night on 19 January 1990, after the demolition of the central television station and termination of phone and radio lines by Soviet special forces, 26,000 Soviet troops entered Baku, smashing through the barricades in order to crush the Popular Front. As claimed by Mikhail Gorbachev, gunmen of the Azerbaijani National Front opened fire on the soldiers; however, findings of the Moscow-based non-governmental organization &quot;Shield&quot; found no evidence of &quot;armed combatants of Azerbaijani Popular Front&quot;, which was used as a motive to crush the civilian population on 20 January.

The independent &quot;Shield&quot; organization which consists of a group of lawyers and officers in reserve, observed human rights violations in the army and its military operations, and concluded that the army waged a war on its civilians and demanded to start a criminal investigation against the Minister of Defence, Dmitry Yazov, who had personally led the operation. The Azerbaijani Interior Ministry officials helped Popular Front activists in stirring disorder by providing them with weapons, technical facilities, and informing them about the movement of army units.

The troops attacked the protesters, firing into the crowds. The shooting continued for three days. They acted pursuant to a state of emergency, which continued for more than four months afterward, declared by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, signed by Chairman Mikhail Gorbachev. The state of emergency was, however, disclosed to the Azerbaijani public only several hours after the beginning of the offensive, when many citizens already lay dead or wounded in the streets, hospitals and morgues of Baku.

Almost the whole population of Baku turned out to bury the dead on the third day, 22 January. For another 40 days, the country stayed away from work as a sign of mourning and mass protest.

===Death toll===

According to several sources, between 133 and 137 civilians died with the unofficial number reaching 300. Up to 800 were injured and 5 went missing. An additional 26 people were killed in Neftchala and Lankaran regions of the country.

According to one report, 93 Azerbaijanis and 29 Soviet soldiers were killed in the street skirmishes. Other reports state that 21 soldiers were killed and 90 wounded in the fighting. However, how the soldiers died is still disputed. The soldiers&#x27; death toll was claimed by Soviet authorities to have resulted from armed resistance, although some of the soldiers could have been victims of friendly fire.

===State of emergency===
General Secretary Gorbachev and other officials asserted that it was necessary to stop pogroms and violence against the Armenian population and to thwart efforts by extremists to overthrow the Soviet Azerbaijani government. The government&#x27;s decree said: &quot;Extremist groups are organizing mass disorders fanning national enmity. They are committing bold criminal acts, mining roads, and bridges, shelling settlements, taking hostages.&quot;

Defence Minister Yazov also said that nationalists were plotting a coup d&#x27;état in Azerbaijan: &quot;A meeting was planned at which it was proposed to declare the transfer of power into the hands of the People&#x27;s Front.&quot; He noted how the &quot;Popular Front&quot; declared its own state of emergency in Baku before the action was taken and how Soviet state organs &quot;ceased to control the situation.&quot;

==News coverage==
During the Black January crackdown, Soviet authorities managed to suppress all efforts to disseminate news from Azerbaijan to the local population and the international community. On the eve of the military intervention, one of the leaders of Popular Front, Ekhtibar Mamedov, proposed to Kremlin officials that he appear on Azerbaijani TV at 8 PM to announce that the First Secretary of Azerbaijani Communist Party, Abdurrahman Vazirov, would be leaving, and no troops would invade Baku, thus restoring order.

Instead, an energy supply source to Azerbaijani TV and State Radio was blown up by intelligence officers at 7:15 PM in order to cut off the population from any source of information. TV and radio were silent and all print media was banned. But Mirza Khazar and his staff at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty succeeded in broadcasting daily reports from Baku, making it the only source of news to Azerbaijanis within and outside of the country for several days. The Kremlin leadership tried hard to keep the outside world and the population inside Azerbaijan unaware of the intervention, but Mirza Khazar and his staff foiled this attempt. Because of the actions of Mirza Khazar and his staff at Radio Liberty, Azerbaijanis in and outside Azerbaijan, as well as the international community, learned about the actions of the Soviet Army and were able to organize a protest.

Shocked by this development, the government of the USSR complained officially to the United States about Radio Liberty&#x27;s coverage of the military&#x27;s intervention in Azerbaijan. The 20 January 1990 broadcasts turned Mirza Khazar into a popular figure among Azerbaijanis in and outside Azerbaijan. Malahat Aghajanqizi, a well-known Azerbaijani poet and writer, described Mirza Khazar&#x27;s appearance on radio at the time of the Soviet military action as follows: &quot;On January 20, Mirza Khazar with his God-given divine voice gave hope to the dying Azerbaijani people.&quot;

==Assessment==
A special session of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR was held on 22 January 1990 at the request of the public and by the initiative of a group of MPs. It tried to initially assess the 20 January events and adopted some documents condemning the crackdown operation by the Soviet army.

The Memorial Society and Helsinki Watch reported in May 1991 that they had found compelling evidence that the imposition of the state of emergency had led to an unwarranted breach of civil liberties and that Soviet troops had used unjustified force resulting in many deaths. This includes the usage of armored vehicles, bayonets and firing on clearly marked ambulances.

The Human Rights Watch report entitled &quot;Black January in Azerbaijan&quot; states: &quot;Indeed, the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 was so out of proportion to the resistance offered by Azerbaijanis as to constitute an exercise in collective punishment. Since Soviet officials have stated publicly that the purpose of the intervention of Soviet troops was to prevent the ouster of the Communist-dominated government of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the nationalist-minded, noncommunist opposition, the punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan but in the other republics of the Soviet Union.&quot;

&quot;The subsequent events in the Baltic Republics – where, in a remarkable parallel to the events in Baku, the alleged civil disorder was cited as justification for violent intervention by Soviet troops – further confirms that the Soviet Government has demonstrated that it will deal harshly with nationalist movements&quot;, continues the Human Rights Watch report.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial of 4 January 1995 stated that Gorbachev chose to use violence against &quot;independence-seeking Azerbaijan.&quot; When a year later the world press criticized Gorbachev for violent massacres of civilians in Lithuania and Latvia, the Azerbaijani public was embittered by the silence of the world media on Gorbachev&#x27;s orders a year earlier, during Black January.

===Independence===
On 18 October 1991, the Azerbaijan parliament restored the country&#x27;s independence. On 14 February 1992, the Azerbaijani General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office instituted a lawsuit targeted at the individuals involved in the massacre. In March 2003, the same lawsuit was targeted at the ex-Soviet president Gorbachev for violating the article 119 of the Soviet Constitution and article 71 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijani SSR. In 1994, the National Assembly of Azerbaijan adopted a full political and legal evaluation of the Black January events. According to the decree of the President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev from 16 December 1999, all victims of the crackdown were awarded an honorary title of the &quot;Martyr of January 20&quot; ().

20 January is marked as Martyrs&#x27; Day (or literally, &quot;the Day of the Nationwide Sorrow&quot;) in Azerbaijan. In 2025, the 35th anniversary, the commemoration of this and Black January included a 4,000-person flash mob.

==Memorial==
20 January is recognized as a Day of Mourning and it is commemorated as the Day of Nationwide Sorrow (). In January 2010, a memorial for the Black January victims was erected in the Yasamal district of Baku. The monument was designed by Javanshir Dadashov and Azad Agayed, and architect Adalat Mammadov. The opening of the monument took place on 20 January 2010. The President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and the head of the presidential administration Ramiz Mehdiyev, chief executive of Yasamal Ibrahim Mehdiyev, and families of the victims of the tragedy attended the ceremony. The total area of the complex is . The height of the monument and pedestal is . The memorial depicts a group of people who are determined not to miss armed troops coming into the city, with some of them already fallen.

<text>The buffy-tufted marmoset (Callithrix aurita), also known as the buffy tufted-ear marmoset or white-eared marmoset, is a New World monkey that lives in the forests on the Atlantic coast of southeast Brazil. Of all the marmosets, it has the southernmost range.

The buffy-tufted marmoset resembles the common marmoset, but is somewhat larger. It has grey-black skin, and the most obvious differences from the common marmoset are its whitish face (&quot;skull-like facial mask&quot;,) brown crown, and shorter ear tufts.

== Distribution ==
The buffy-tufted marmoset is endemic to the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil, occurring in ombrophilous and semideciduous forests in the Serras do Mar and Mantiqueira in the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, and extending to the North of Rio Doce in Minas Gerais. They forage and travel in the lower canopy and dense understorey vegetation, typically found between 6 and 9 meters above the ground. Alongside &quot;C. flaviceps&quot;, they are the species inhabiting areas with the most extreme climatic conditions.

It occurs in perennial, semideciduous, secondary, mixed montane forests, interspersed with stands of bamboo at altitudes ranging from 80 to 1200 meters.

== Morphology ==
It has an overall black coloration, but they can also be found with reddish spots or speckled with red, without presenting a general pattern of stripes. Moreover, its reddish spots provide the characteristic golden hue that gave rise to the species&#x27; name &quot;aurita&quot;. Its forehead is white, with the sides of the face being black, sometimes speckled with red. They have short (20 to 50 mm), white intra-auricular tufts that can vary to a brownish hue. The feet are brown, and the hands are a strongly weathered brown color. The tail is black with white rings.

It is probably the largest species in the &quot;Callithrix&quot; genus, weighing 400–450 g and with a body length of 19–25 cm and a tail length of 27–35 cm.

== Ecology ==
It is diurnal and arboreal, living almost all its life in the trees in groups that usually consist of 4 to 8 individuals, although it&#x27;s possible to find groups of 11 individuals, with only one reproductive pair of male and female, with a dominant female. The offspring, always twins, are born after a gestation period of 144 days and are carried by the parents in the first weeks of life. Older siblings assist in caring for the offspring. When they reach adulthood, they migrate to other groups to form new pairs. Their activity period is reduced during hot-dry times. During the rainy season - 6:30-19:00 / dry season - 7:30-16:30. Their resting sites are associated with dense vegetation.

They feed on resins and other plant secretions, as well as plant material itself, such as fruits and tree gum. During dry periods, they adapt their diet to include animal matter, such as lepidoptera larvae, orthopterans, cockroaches, spiders, harvestmen, snakes, lizards, small frogs and bird eggs. Studies also show that this species can feed on bamboo fungi.

It can establish sympatry with other species like those of the genus &quot;Cebus&quot; and &quot;Callicebus&quot;, but there are no records of sympatry with other forms of &quot;Callithrix&quot;.

== Conservation ==
This species is present on the list of endangered species in the mentioned states where it occurs, as well as on the Brazilian and global lists. Its restricted distribution, habitat destruction, population decline, competition with other species, and hybridization due to the introduction of invasive exotic species (&quot;Callithrix jacchus&quot; and &quot;C. penicillata&quot;) are among the main threats.

<doc id="1322746" wikidata="Q2368503" url="?curid=1322746" title="Surfboat">
<text>A surfboat (or surf boat) is an oar-driven boat designed to enter the ocean from the beach in heavy surf or severe waves. It is often used in lifesaving or rescue missions where the most expedient access to victims is directly from the beach.

==Construction==
The boat building traditions of several countries produced the same basic design when faced with the same problem, that of passing through turbulent whitewater and breaking waves and returning to shore. A broad stern presented to steep and breaking waves when approaching shore can result in broaching (turning sideways to the swell) and swamping or capsizing of the boat. Therefore, surf boats have a pointed stern and usually a fairly marked sheer.

The best-known exception to this double-ended nature of surf boats, is the coble of north-eastern England. Here, the broaching problem was resolved by beaching stern first. The run (the after part of the bottom) was broad, flat and straight so that once the boat had beached, it remained upright. However, beaching the boat was a special skill which involved unshipping the rudder at the right moment. Because they do not fit the usual double-ended pattern, cobles are not normally called surf boats.

Until the 1950s, the most widely known surfboats were those of Accra, Ghana. Until a port was built, commercial cargoes were landed through the surf by very skillful boatmen with strong arms and equally strong nerve.

In Tristan da Cunha and Pitcairn Island the surf boats are known as longboats.

==Use==

Surf boat rowing is very popular in Australia and New Zealand and to a lesser extent South Africa. Usually associated with Surf Life Saving Clubs, surf boat crews are trained in life saving skills as well as boat handling technique. Powered vessels such as inflatable skiffs and Jet Ski personal watercraft have replaced surf boats as the primary tools for real world rescue efforts, but surfboat training and competition remain popular as recreational activities among both professional rescuers and amateur athletes.

<text>In Scottish geography, a Carse (the modern form of older Scots ; Scottish Gaelic or ) is an area of fertile, low-lying (typically alluvial) land occupying certain Scottish river valleys, such as that of the River Forth.

==Carse of Forth ==
The Carse of Forth contrasts with the Ochil Hills to the north, from which it is separated by the Ochil Fault. The carse is generally so flat that, except in the case of alluvial fans, such as that on which the small town of Alva is situated, it has only reached a height of about 9 metres above sea level at the Ochil Fault, typically two or more miles from the river.

In the case of the River Forth, the carse extends some considerable distance above and below Stirling, where due to constraints such as the Abbey Craig to the north and the castle rock, on which the town is based, to the south, it is very narrow.

The carse typically offers good agricultural land, however underlying the topsoil and alluvium is glacial boulder clay. In other places, especially in the west, the carse was overlain by peat bogs such as Flanders Moss, much of which has been cleared to improve agriculture.

<text>Kitty Kornered is a 1946 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon, directed by Robert Clampett. The short was released on June 8, 1946, and stars Porky Pig and Sylvester.

Porky and Sylvester would later be paired in a trio of shorts directed by Chuck Jones: &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot;, &quot;Claws for Alarm&quot;, and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jupiter&quot;. Both also appeared (with Daffy Duck) in &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot; as a villain (the only time Sylvester spoke in a Chuck Jones-directed cartoon).

==Plot==

Porky Pig kicks his four cats, including Sylvester, out of the house for the night; outside, it&#x27;s cold and snowy and the cats aren&#x27;t having it, so they turn the tables on Porky and throw &quot;him&quot; out, instead.
Porky, extremely angry, returns to the house and frightens the cats away by making a shadow puppet of his dog &quot;Lassie&quot; with his fingers.
When Sylvester discovers they&#x27;ve been duped, the cats plot revenge by dressing up as martians and faking a &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; type radio bulletin which scares the heck out of Porky.
Porky breaks the glass case on the wall containing a shotgun (&quot;USE ONLY IN CASE OF INVASION FROM MARS&quot;) and aims it at the &quot;martians&quot; who are now advancing up the stairs with swords, all dressed as Teddy Roosevelt (&quot;Charge!!&quot;). Porky jumps through a window and the cats laugh at him.
Shivering in the snow in his nightshirt, Porky asks the audience if they know of anyone with a house for rent.

==Reception==
Comics historian Craig Yoe writes, &quot;In this uproariously funny film written by director Robert Clampett himself, everything and everyone is made of rubber. The last half has some of the most exhilirating action ever put on film.&quot;

==Cultural references==
&quot;Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet&quot; was a World War II hit song by Ella Mae Morse, and was sung by Nancy Walker in the film &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot;.

The wine that the grey drunken cat was drinking says &quot;Arsenic and Old Grapes&quot; is a parody reference to &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;.

On &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;, the &quot;Men from Mars&quot; characters made an appearance in &quot;Spaced Out&quot;.

The cats charging up the stairs at Porky assume the appearances of Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders cavalry (possibly in reference to the film &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;).

<text>Tim Vincent (born Timothy Russell Walker; 4 November 1972) is a British actor and television presenter from Overton-on-Dee, Wales. He appeared on the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; between 1993 and 1997 and has presented several Miss World contests. For several years, Vincent was based in the United States where he presented some mainstream shows such as &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Phenomenon&quot;.

==Career==

===Acting===
Vincent first took to acting at Theatr Clwyd, in nearby Mold. His first television role was playing alcoholic teenager Billy Ryan in the ITV drama series &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot;. Vincent also appeared in pantomime for several years, always playing the role of Dandini in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, at Southport, Torquay, Widnes and York. From 2000 to 2001, he played veterinarian Adam Forrester in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;Sorted&quot; with Tim Curry and Jason Donovan.

===Presenting===
On 16 December 1993, Vincent began presenting &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. During his time on the programme, he completed the New York Marathon and travelled to South Africa. He left &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on 24 January 1997, having already featured in two series of the drama &quot;Dangerfield&quot; and began presenting &quot;The Clothes Show&quot;.

Vincent&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; colleagues in his time were John Leslie, Anthea Turner, Diane-Louise Jordan, Stuart Miles, Katy Hill and Romana D&#x27;Annunzio. He has also appeared on Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank.

After leaving &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Dangerfield&quot;, Vincent presented &quot;Short Change&quot; and &quot;Fully Booked&quot;. He starred on the first series of the reality television series, &quot;I&#x27;m Famous and Frightened!&quot; in addition to the Sky One series &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Miriam&quot;. In 2005, he presented a Conservative Party party political broadcast.

Vincent was a reporter on &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;. In 2006, he hosted the pilots for GSN&#x27;s revival of the classic 1980s game show &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; , but did not host the series itself as the job went to former Fuse VJ Dylan Lane for the series.

Vincent presented the Miss World contest in 2005, 2006, 2014, 2015 and Miss USA in 2007. He also filled in for Meredith Vieira, for a week of &quot;the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, 25–29 June 2007. Shortly after, Vincent presented the National Lottery Draws on the BBC.

Vincent lived and worked in the United States for several years but has now returned to the UK. In February 2009, Vincent, along with actor Joe Swash, became Guinness World Record Holder for throwing the most pancakes to a partner as part of a challenge on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;.

On 24 October 2007, Vincent hosted the NBC series &quot;Phenomenon&quot;.

In 2008, Vincent competed in the third series of the UK reality programme &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; and was eliminated on 10 February 2008. His Riedell size 12 ice skates were auctioned off for £50.

Vincent also hosted a Live special episode of &quot;Criss Angel Mindfreak&quot; on 30 July 2008.

Vincent has presented shows on Galaxy, London&#x27;s 95.8 Capital FM and in August 2009, was announced as the guest host of Kim Wilde&#x27;s Secret Songs Sunday on Magic 105.4 FM (London).

<text>Jeanne Agnès Berthelot de Pléneuf, marquise de Prie (August 1698 – 7 October 1727), was a French noblewoman who for a brief period exercised extraordinary control of the French court during the reign of King Louis XV.

==Early life==
Jeanne Agnès Berthelot de Pléneuf, Marquise de Prie, is a notable historical figure in early 18th century France for her role in the political machinations. Agnès’s story is an example of the intersection of power, gender, and politics living at a time when women’s influence was exerted behind the thrones of authoritative men.

Born in 1698, Jeanne Agnès presents a glance into the world of French nobility early on in the 18th century. She was the daughter of the wealthy but unscrupulous financier Étienne Berthelot de Pléneuf which shaped an opulent upbringing for her, that enabled her to advance within the upper echelons of French society. However, her upbringing entered her into the rigidly structured French society at the time. Her status set her up for a prominent role in the sphere of politics through the advantageous position of her birthright.

In her time, a strict hierarchical French society was set in place. Her upbringing was during the dominant and long reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King, whose court at Versailles was considered the focal point of both French and European power dynamics. The society was split into three estates: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). The presence of such a structure exposed her to the complexities of court politics, where power dynamics were in constant disequilibrium. Such a position required a keen skill in social maneuvering, as her status was dependent on pursuing favor with influential figures, such as the king, amidst navigating an environment of conspiracy and competition within the court.

Preparing for her position as a courtier and patron, her upbringing comprised a challenging education for women of her status. Her education emphasized etiquette, achievement in the arts, and languages. It was expected of such women to navigate the intricate societal hierarchies of the court, using their influence discreetly to sway political decisions and organize valuable unions.

Jeanne Agnès&#x27;s upbringing was thoroughly influenced by the ancient régime&#x27;s social stratification, in which ancestry and prestige were a key determinant of one’s status in society. Before the impacts that came with the French Revolution, this era was characterized by prosperity for the novel, while the commoners bore the burden of substantial taxation and disregard by society.

== Life at court ==
At the age of 21, she returned to France, from the Savoy where she accompanied her husband, she and was soon the declared mistress of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon (&quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;), who was prime minister at the beginning of the reign of Louis XV (1723–1726). Being the mistress of the prime minister allowed her to have unprecedented power for a woman in the French court. During his ministry she dominated the royal court, one of the most prominent and historically significant actions she took during this time was facilitating the marriage of Louis XV of France to Marie Leszczynska who became a very beloved and popular Queen of France for the masses of the third estate all through out her near 43 year tenure. Queen Marie earned the nickname &quot;The Good Queen&quot; due to her extensive charitable works for the poor people of France whom she regarded as her &quot;children&quot;. Among of her initial choices before the Polish princess was Anne of Great Britain and Mademoiselle de Vermandois, the younger sister of the Duke of Bourbon. The prime minister and the Marquise de Prie are thought to have picked Marie Leszczynska as the future queen in order to gain future power for themselves.

Following the marriage between Marie and King Louis, Berthelot de Pléneuf struck up a friendship with the young queen. This would lead to a two-year-long companionship in which the Marquise de Prie and the prime minister were able to orchestrate political change in their favor. In 1725, at the time of Louis XV&#x27;s marriage, she brought Voltaire to court. Thanks to her and with the intervension of the young Queen Marie Leczinska, three pieces by Voltaire were included in the wedding festivities. Overall scholarly articles support that Berthelot de Pléneuf was highly disliked in French society, viewed as conceited, and her political ambition made her unpopular amongst other ladies at court.

Two years after orchestrating the marriage to Marie Leszczynska, both the Duke of Bourbon and the Marquise de Prie were exiled after they planned to get rid of the rival of the Duke – Cardinal Fleury. In this plan, they manipulated the queen that the king was the one who wanted the Cardinal gone. This plan backfired as King Louis XV found out that the Cardinal was to be sent away. After discovering that Berthelot de Pléneuf and the Duke of Bourbon were behind this they were both exiled. Fleury replaced Bourbon as prime minister. Historical evidence has no record of the relationship between Berthelot de Pléneuf and the Duke continuing after their punishment.

== End of life ==
During her last weeks, The Marquise&#x27;s personal life has been stated to be filled with suffering and isolation. Quickly after her exile and the death of her father, her mental and physical health rapidly deteriorated. She began to go blind and contracted tuberculosis. She sought help from different doctors, but they dismissed her condition as hysteria. She prepared for her death by making changes to her will. On September 19, she added a codicil to her will, revoking donations to certain individuals and leaving everything to her children. Twelve days later, she became bedridden with pain that lasted for four days until her death.

As the Marquise succumbed to her downfall, Jeanne died on October 7, 1727. The cause of her death remains uncertain. The belief that the Marquise committed suicide comes from a single contemporary who was known to dislike the Marquise and was a hypochondriac, and who had grievances against various ministers and favorites, including the Duc. An alternative perspective is given in a biography written by Henri Thirion. Thirion suggests that there were also natural causes at play. According to this perspective, the Marquise had requested a sedative that contained opium, which was seen as a poison by those around her. The small dose she took was to temporarily relieve her. Her illness ended up worsening, which resulted in convulsions and eclampsia for a few years leading up to her death. Thirion adds that while traveling by carriage near Courbépine, her horses spooked, causing the carriage to overturn. The broken windows caused severe injuries, ultimately leading to her death. The text suggests that her emotional state, overexertion, and pre-existing illness contributed to her demise.

After her death, the Marquise was still seen as a threat. Her adversaries, particularly Fleury, resorted to maligning her character to discredit the prime minister. They accused her of various infamies, such as greed and promiscuity. By making her disliked by the public and presenting her as a danger to the state, they forced the prince to disassociate himself from her, and as a result, Madame de Prie and the Duc retreated from the political scene.

== References in popular culture ==
Outward discontent of the Marquise continued for generations. Fueled by her family and friends abandoning her quickly after her exile and death, information on Jeanne Agnes Berthelot, Madame Prie remains limited. A few found media sources that cover her life or are based on her include:

Her exile from the court and suicide are the subject of a short fictional work by Stefan Zweig, &quot;Geschichte eines Unterganges&quot; or &quot;Story of a Downfall&quot; (1910).

At the start of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; drama Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle (1839), the Duke of Richelieu breaks off a relationship with the Marquise de Prie while the latter is titular mistress of the Duke of Bourbon.

Charlotte Rampling played de Prie in the 1996 TV movie &quot;La dernière fête&quot;, titled in English &quot;The Fall of the Marquise de Prie&quot;.

<doc id="1322799" wikidata="Q1049238" url="?curid=1322799" title="Sailing at the 1928 Summer Olympics">
<text>Sailing/Yachting is an Olympic sport starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule. The Sailing program of 1928 consisted of a total of three sailing classes. For each class races were scheduled from 2–9 August 1928 on the Buiten Y near Amsterdam and on the Zuiderzee. The sailing was done on the triangular type Olympic courses.

== Venue ==
Source:
=== Six Harbor ===
As venue for the Amsterdam Olympics the Zuiderzee near Amsterdam was chosen. The organizing committee of the sailing event was the Koninklijk Verbond Nederlandsche Watersport Vereniging. The Olympic harbor Six Harbor was on the North shore of the Y just opposite of the Amsterdam Centraal railway station. The boats were moored in the so-called &#x27;kinderkamer&#x27; of the harbor. The Six Harbor was in that time the location of the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Zeil- &amp; Roeivereeniging. This resulted that all competing yachts had to go through the Oranje Locks to enter the Buiten Y and Zuiderzee. Some of the former buildings of the Six Harbor were demolished during the construction of the Amsterdam Metro North–south line.

=== Course areas ===
A total of two race areas were used for sailing at the Amsterdam Olympics:
* The courses of the 12&#x27; Dinghy were just outside the locks on the buiten Y in front of Durgerdam.
* For the 6 and 8 Metre the used courses were about 5 nm out of the locks, East of the Isle of Marken on the Zuiderzee.

At that time the Zuiderzee had an open connection with the North Sea. The sea water was salt or at best brackish. Waves could be steep and short due to the shallow waters.

In 1932 a dam was built between the North Sea and the Zuiderzee and the Zuiderzee was renamed IJsselmeer. As result of this the lake now contains fresh water. Inside the lake new land was reclaimed. At this moment the center of the 1928 6 and 8 Metre course is located in the city of Almere. Also the city of Amsterdam reclaimed land from the sea and moved towards the lake. When the sailors from the 1928 Summer Olympics could return to their venue they would hardly recognize it.

<doc id="1322806" wikidata="Q5009671" url="?curid=1322806" title="CCOW">
<text>In the context of health informatics, CCOW (&quot;pr&quot; /seacow/) or Clinical Context Object Workgroup is a Health Level Seven International standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to synchronize in real time, and at the user-interface level. It is vendor independent and allows applications to present information at the desktop and portal level in a unified way.

CCOW is the primary standard protocol in healthcare to facilitate a process called &quot;context management&quot;. Context management is the process of using particular &quot;subjects&quot; of interest (e.g., user, patient, clinical encounter, charge item, etc.) to virtually link disparate applications so that the end-user sees them operate in a unified, cohesive way.

Context management can be utilized for both CCOW and non-CCOW compliant applications. The CCOW standard exists to facilitate a more robust, and near &quot;plug-and-play&quot; interoperability across disparate applications.

Context management is often combined with single sign-on applications in the healthcare environment, but the two are discrete functions. Single sign-on is the process that enables the secure access of disparate applications by a user through use of a single authenticated identifier and password. Context management augments this by then enabling the user to identify subjects once (e.g., a patient) and have all disparate systems into which the user is granted access to &quot;tune&quot; to this patient simultaneously. As the user further identifies particular &quot;subjects&quot; of interest (e.g., a particular visit), those applications containing information about the selected subject will then automatically and seamlessly to the user &quot;tune&quot; to that information as well. The end result for the user is an aggregated view of all patient information across disparate applications.

Use of context management, facilitated by CCOW or non-CCOW compliant applications, is valuable for both client-server, and web-based applications. Furthermore, a fully robust context manager will enable use for both client-server and web-based applications on a single desktop / kiosk, allowing the user to utilize both types of applications in a &quot;context aware&quot; session.

==Purpose==

The goal of CCOW is seemingly simple, but its implementation is rather complex. CCOW is designed to communicate the name of the active user between various programs on the same machine. The user should only need to log into one application, and the other applications running on the machine will &quot;know&quot; who is logged in. There are a great deal of exceptions and circumstances that make this scenario far more difficult than it appears.

In order to accomplish this task, every CCOW compliant application on the machine must log into a central CCOW server called a Vault. The application sends an encrypted application passcode to verify its identity. Once the application is verified, it may change the active user (also called the &quot;context&quot;) on the machine. Each CCOW application also has an application &quot;name&quot; for which there can only be one instance. There is no correct application name (the passcode identifies which application is logging in). There may be multiple instances of the CCOW application connected to the CCOW vault from the same computer. However, they must have different names. One name might be &quot;I like HHAM&quot;, while the other might be &quot;I like CCOW&quot;. The names are completely arbitrary.

After the application authenticates itself with the CCOW vault, the applications are ready to communicate the context (a.k.a. the active user). Here would be a step-by-step example of a CCOW exchange:

#The computer boots up and the medical applications load.
#Each application logs into CCOW using its secret passcode (and unique application name).
#The compliant application displays a login prompt, and the user logs in as &quot;Mary Jane&quot;.
#Mary Jane has a &quot;CCOW ID&quot;. Let us assume that her CCOW ID is &quot;MJane&quot;.
#The compliant application notifies the CCOW vault that &quot;MJane&quot; is now logged in.
#Once CCOW verifies that &quot;MJane&quot; is a valid CCOW user, the vault notifies all the other applications that &quot;MJane&quot; is logged in.
#All of the other applications realize that the CCOW ID &quot;MJane&quot; is referring to &quot;Mary Jane&quot; (because they have been configured as such). They log in &quot;Mary Jane&quot; automatically.
#The transaction is complete. All of the applications running on the machine have been automatically logged in as &quot;Mary Jane&quot;.

The purpose of the application passcode is to verify that no unauthorized applications can &quot;hack&quot; into CCOW and change the active user (thereby allowing unauthorized access to medical records).

==Status==
* The HL7 CCOW work group was merged into the Infrastructure and Messaging work group in 2010.
* The most recent version of the HL7 Context Management (CcOW) Specification, Version 1.6 was balloted as a normative standard in October 2017.

<text>Kenneth Frank Barrington (24 November 193014 March 1981), was an English international cricketer who played for the England cricket team and Surrey County Cricket Club in the 1950s and 1960s. He was a right-handed batsman and occasional leg-spin bowler, known for his jovial good humour and long, defensive innings &quot;batting with bulldog determination and awesome concentration&quot;.

His batting improved with the quality of the opposition; he averaged 39.87 in the County Championship, 45.63 in first-class cricket, 58.67 in Test cricket and 63.96 against Australia. Of players with a completed career, only Don Bradman with his average of 99.94 made more than Barrington&#x27;s 6,806 Test runs at a higher average, which is the seventh highest of batsmen who have made 1,000 Test runs, and the highest by a post-war England batsman. His 256 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in 1964 is the third highest score for England against Australia and the highest since the Second World War. Barrington twice made centuries in four successive Tests, and was the first England batsmen to make hundreds on all six traditional Test grounds: Old Trafford, Edgbaston, Headingley, Lord&#x27;s, Trent Bridge and The Oval.

His Test career ended when he had a heart attack in Australia in 1968, even though he had several potentially fruitful years ahead of him. From 1975 to 1981 he was an England selector and a regular tour manager. He died from a second heart attack on 14 March 1981 during the Third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, where he had made his maiden Test century 21 years before.

==Early life==

===Family===
Ken Barrington was the eldest child of Percy and Winifred Barrington and had two brothers, Roy and Colin, and a sister, Sheila. His father was a career soldier who served in the British Army for 28 years, 24 of them in the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Despite winning a row of medals for service around the world including the First World War Percy Barrington remained a private and when Ken was born was a batman in the officer&#x27;s mess at Brock Barracks in Reading, Berkshire. His children grew up in the barracks and led a rather spartan life during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Percy remained at Brock Barracks in the Second World War, left the Army in 1947 and took up work as a watchman for Handley Page. When Ken became a professional cricketer he often gave his family tickets for the Oval so they could see him play.

===Boyhood cricket===
Percy Barrington was a keen cricketer, played for the regimental cricket team as an all-rounder and taught all his children how to play, using a piece of wood as a cricket bat. Ken attended Wilson Central primary school. When he moved to Katesgrove Secondary school at the age of 11 he joined the school cricket team, as a batsman and fast bowler. In one early game he opened the bowling with Ray Reeves (who later played football for Reading F.C.) and dismissed the opposition for 10 runs in 15 minutes. In 1945 Barrington left school aged 14 and took up work as a motor mechanic in Reading, Fred Titmus saying &quot;he could drive anything from a tank to a scooter&quot;.

After a year he joined Reading Cricket Club as the assistant groundsman, a job that allowed him unlimited opportunity to practice cricket. It is here that he learned the art of leg-spin. His old boss told him &quot;You will never make a living in cricket&quot;. Barrington played for the White Hart Hotel XI on Sundays and the Reading Wednesday XI where he was spotted by the ex-England and Surrey batsman Andy Sandham. Sandham invited him to play for the Surrey Colts at the age of 16. Barrington took 5/43 and made 4 not out in his first game and became a regular player in their Saturday cricket matches. Here he came under the tutorage of Andrew Kempton, a friend of Sir Jack Hobbs. He took 30 wickets at an average of 13, but batted down the order.

===Surrey groundstaff===
In August 1947, Barrington was asked to join the groundstaff of the prestigious Surrey County Cricket Club at the Kennington Oval in South London for the following season. From April 1948, he commuted to London by railway for his training, having yet to see a first-class cricket match. The Chief Coach was Andy Sandham who thought his leg-spin bowling lacked accuracy (Surrey had Jim Laker and Tony Lock so did not need another spinner) and made him concentrate on his batting. Alec Bedser predicted that Barrington was a future Test player and Sandham later stated that Barrington was his best pupil. He worked on preparing the vast Oval ground for first-class cricket and played for the Surrey Club and Ground cricket team, though still down the order. In the 1949 season he only had time to play one game, making 52 against Kew, before he was called up for National Service.

===National Service===
Barrington served as a Lance-Corporal in the Wiltshire Regiment stationed in Germany. He grew from to during this time and he was encouraged to pursue sports. Apart from cricket, he represented his battalion at football, won the battalion boxing championship and a small arms competition at the Mons Officer Cadet School. His leg-spin was helped by the matting wickets used by the British Army cricket team. As he was the only NCO in the team, when they played the officers travelled in staff cars and Barrington by himself in an army truck. Barrington had strong army connections and remained in the Territorial Army after his National Service ended in 1950.

==Early career 1950–58==

===Surrey 1950–54===
On his discharge in August 1950 Barrington returned to Surrey and professional coaching. In May 1951 he made his first century batting against Kenley at number seven and was promoted to the top order. In July he added 64 and 194 not out against the Surrey Colts and Barrington started to play for the Surrey Second XIa minor county team. In 1952 he became a star batsman, making 1,097 runs at 57.73 including 157 not out and 151 in successive games against Devon County Cricket Club and was mentioned in &quot;Wisden&quot;.

Stuart Surridge became captain of Surrey in 1952 and led them to their first of a record seven successive County Championships. (They had shared the trophy with Middlesex in 1950). In 1953 Barrington joined this formidable Surrey team including Alec and Eric Bedser, Peter May, Jim Laker, Tony Lock, Peter Loader and Arthur McIntyre. Their bowling line up was of Test class and it was for his growing batting skills that the young Barrington was called up. He made his first-class cricket debut against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in their traditional match against the champions at Lord&#x27;s at the start of the cricket season. Barrington batted at number six and was stumped by Godfrey Evans off Alan Oakman for 7 in the first innings and caught off Oakman for 17 in the second as Surrey lost a low scoring match by 107 runs. His second match began the next day against the 1953 Australians and he was dismissed by Ken Archer (11/61) for 10 and 4 in another defeat, this time by an innings and 76 runs. Richie Benaud recalled that he was a very correct batsman, but Barrington was returned to the Second XI.

He played only a few games in the County Championship and top-scored with 81 against Worcestershire. Surrey won without his help in 1953, but in July 1954 they were in severe trouble, in eighth place and 46 points behind the leaders Yorkshire. After a few fifties Barrington made his maiden first-class century against Gloucestershire at the Oval. Surrey were 149/7 when he was joined by Jim Laker in a partnership of 198, Barrington 108 not out and Laker 113. In the second innings he came in at 39/4 made 68 and Surrey won by 145 runs. Surrey won 10 of their next 12 games and the Championship. Barrington made 89 against Essex in a game where nobody else passed 50 and 102 against the Pakistanis. The arrival of Barrington and Mickey Stewart was seen as the turning point in Surrey&#x27;s fortunes and E.M. Wellings wrote that he was the best young batting prospect since Denis Compton, adding &quot;He is a brilliant strokemaker and now has such a sound defence that he is as convincing on the wet wickets as on the dry.

===Marriage===
Ken Barrington met his future wife Ann Cozens at a dance in Reading in 1952. She was a secretary for the local Education Department, taught at Sunday School and played netball. He proposed to her on a train to Reading and her father agreed to the marriage if they saved £500. As a result, they married on 6 March 1954 and honeymooned in Devon until Ken was called up for the Territorial Army at Salisbury. They remained happily married for 27 years until his death. As first-class cricketers rarely had employment in the winter Barrington worked for British Rail (painting Oxford station), a firm of solicitors and at a job selling perfumes and carpets. They first lived with Ann&#x27;s parents, but in 1956 bought their own house in Mitcham in Surrey near the Oval, where he found work nearby with a firm of accountants and Ann at a travel agents.

===South Africa 1955===

&quot;If he should not do conspicuously well and the established players become available, he is almost bound, temporarily at least, to join the very long list of youthful cricketers prematurely tried for England and promptly discarded.&quot;
:E.W. Swanton

In 1955 Surrey won their first 9 matches and Surridge&#x27;s vice-captain Peter May succeeded Len Hutton as captain of England. Barrington made 135 not out against Lancashire and 126 against Nottinghamshire, which won him his county cap. Now established in the Surrey team he was called up for the First Test against South Africa at Trent Bridge, hearing the news when a crowd cheered him while batting in a charity match. He batted at number 4, replacing Colin Cowdrey who was unable to play. Barrington made a duck and though England won by an innings he felt isolated from the England regulars who he barely knew. He was kept in the side for the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, coming in at 30/3 in the first innings and making 34, top-scoring in England&#x27;s 133, but looked uncomfortable on a green pitch against the fast bowling of Peter Heine. In the second innings Barrington and Denis Compton added 40 runs, but he was out for 18. Even though England won, Cowdrey was now available and so Barrington was dropped. Returning to Surrey he made 73 out of 171 against Middlesex after coming in at 6/4 and helped the County to their fourth successive Championship. He was voted &quot;Young Cricketer of the Year&quot; by the Cricket Writers Club and was chosen for the 1955–56 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Pakistan.

===Pakistan 1955–56===
The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Pakistan had the dual purpose of spreading cricketing goodwill and providing employment and experience for young players with Test potential. There were no Test matches, but they did play Pakistan as the MCC. The team was managed by the genial Geoffrey Howard, the Secretary of Lancashire and captained by Donald Carr, the captain of Derbyshire and included Fred Titmus, Brian Close, Tony Lock, Jim Parks and Peter Richardson. Barrington made 70 not out in the first match against Karachi and 66 in the second against Sind. The first match between Pakistan and the MCC at Lahore was a dull draw, followed by two wins for Pakistan and a close victory for the MCC by two wickets in the fourth and final game. Barrington made 10 and 52, 43 and 11, 32 and 0 and 76 and 10 in these matches, the 43 taking 4 hours against the bowling of Fazal Mahmood.

With five other members of the team he &#x27;kidnapped&#x27; Idris Begh the Karachi umpire whose decisions they thought were heavily biased. They poured a bucket of water over him in their apartments and he was laughed at by them and two members of the Pakistani team who happened to witness the event. Begh complained to the Pakistani captain Abdul Kardar and the matter became public, with the crowd chanting &quot;Go home MCC&quot; on the last day of the game. The President of the MCC Lord Alexander offered to recall the tour and the press called for the culprits to be barred from international cricket, but Howard managed to smooth things down and the tour was completed. In a public relations exercise the MCC played football with the Pakistan Air Force with Barrington in goal. Even though Barrington came second in the first-class averages with 586 runs (39.0)Richardson came first with 650 runs (43.44)Carr did not return a favourable report and it would be four years before Barrington would tour again.

===Surrey 1956–58===
The Australians were touring again in 1956 and when Len Maddocks saw Barrington he told Keith Miller &quot;This fellow looks the part; he might give us some trouble before long&quot;. England had a strong team and under Peter May&#x27;s leadership they beat Australia 2–1, the West Indies 3–0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4–0 in 1958. Barrington lost his form in these seasons and could not fight his way back into the England team. Stuart Surridge retired after winning five championships in his five years as captain and in 1956 May took over, winning Surrey&#x27;s sixth consecutive championship in 1957 with a massive 94-point lead. In one area Barrington showed improvement as with Surridge gone Surrey needed another close fielder and he was made first slip. He took 64 catches in his first season in this position and as Mickey Stewart held 77 catches and Tony Lock 63 Surrey more than held onto their chances.

In June 1957 Barrington&#x27;s batting picked up with 12 fours and 4 sixes in his 124 not out against Gloucestershire and 103 not out against the West Indies including their famous spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. Towards the end of the season Barrington could afford to relax and he hit three more hundreds. With no tour in sight Alf Gover offered Ken and Ann the chance to teach cricket in South Africa over the winter. They rented out their house in London, moved to Cape Town and he coached the First and Second XIs at the Roman Catholic St Joseph&#x27;s College, set up an under-11 side in his free time and met a talented Cape Coloured cricketer called Basil d&#x27;Oliveira.

Back at the Oval Barrington had another poor season making only one century and was even dropped from the Surrey team and given the task of transporting the team kit from venue to venue. As a result, he re-worked his batting technique to get behind the ball to improve his defence against in-swing and off-spin. This was coupled with a change of attitude encouraged by Alec Bedser and Jim Laker; he forsook the big hitting of his youth and became a stonewaller, making runs with the minimum of risk. This required endless net-practice and training at Gover&#x27;s cricket school, but by 1958 Barrington emerged as one of the best batsmen in England.

==Under Peter May 1959–61==

===India 1959===
An earlier attempt to turn Barrington into an opener had failed, but McIntyre promoted him to number 3 in the order to stop him getting nervous while pacing around the dressing room waiting to bat. He made 97 against Cambridge University soon followed by 186 and 118 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston; 85 and 59 not out against the Indians at the Oval and 113 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.

This earned him a recall to the England cricket team against a weak Indian side, perfect for playing a batsman into a Test career. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he joined his Surrey and England captain Peter May at 63/3 and was told not to worry about scoring as long as he fought it out. Barrington took 20 minutes to get off the mark, but hit two sixes off Chandu Borde to bring up his 50 and was out for 56 in a stand of 175 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s England were 100/7 when Barrington top-scored with 80; England adding 126 for the last three wickets to set up another big win. The Third Test at Headingley saw him making 80 again, this time adding 193 runs in a stand with Colin Cowdrey in an 8 wicket victory. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford gave him 87, and captain Colin Cowdrey gave him the ball and he took 3/36 with his leg-spin. In the second innings he was told to go for quick runs and hit 46 in 36 minutes with 6 fours and a six, then wrapped things up with 2/75 and a catch as England won by 171 runs.

Back home at the Oval for the Fifth Test Barrington was out for 8, but England completed the 5–0 whitewash with an innings victory. Barrington made 357 runs (59.50) in the series – more than anybody else – and had had his most prolific summer with 2,499 first-class runs (54.32), but Surrey failed to win the County Championship for the first time in 8 years, coming third. His consistent run-making won him the honour of being named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year and he was an automatic choice for the forthcoming tour of the West Indies in 1959–60.

===The West Indies 1959–60===
England had won the 1957 Series 3–0 and had high hopes that they would win again in the West Indies in 1959–60. Surrey had their own tour to Rhodesia, where Barrington made 111 in their 2 run defeat. The England team crossed the Atlantic in a banana boat and were promptly defeated by Barbados even though Barrington made 79 in each innings.

The West Indian fast bowlers Wes Hall and Chester Watson were rightly feared, but on a true pitch at the Kensington Oval in the First Test they could be played and coming in at number 3 Barrington made his maiden Test century128 in England&#x27;s 482. He was stuck on 97 before driving Reg Scarlett to the boundary and was hit in the kidney by a bouncer from Watson. He was given out caught by Gerry Alexander off Sonny Ramadhin, but hesitated to walk after the umpire&#x27;s decision and was made to apologise by the MCC manager Walter Robins. In what were to become familiar figures Barrington&#x27;s century took 340 minutes to compile, but he struck 20 fours.

The Second Test took place at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval which had &#x27;pace like fire&#x27; and Hall and Watson bounced the England batsmen. Barrington saw off their attack and added 132 with Ted Dexter, but was hit on the head by a Wes Hall bouncer on 87. He finished the last few minutes of play, but said &quot;This is a fine – way to play cricket. If these bowlers don&#x27;t watch out they&#x27;re going to kill someone&quot;, which led to another reprimand from Robins. Praised for his courage by the British press Barrington made his second successive century before he was caught by Alexander off Hall for 121 in 340 minutes, the highest score of the match. Barrington hit 49 in the second innings and took 2/34 to dismiss Singh and Watson to wrap up England&#x27;s 256 run victory.

The last three Tests were drawn, but not without incident; &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote &quot;as the tour progressed he took more knocks than most from the bowlers. Nobody relished the short-pitched bowling, but Barrington showed his dislike more than most and as a result became a special target. Nevertheless, he fought bravely&quot;. Barrington proved vulnerable as his expressive face encouraged the fast bowlers and he ducked late, making him look ungainly. His roommate Ray Illingworth said he cried at night because of his injuries and Hall marked him out for his most hostile bowling. Barrington made 16 and 4 in the Third Test and was barely declared fit for the Fourth Test after suffering from bronchial asthma and being hit on the elbow by Hall. He retired hurt for a few minutes, but declined to go to hospital and resumed his innings even though he could not play any strokes, making 5 runs in a stand of 39 with Dave Allen and making a duck in the second innings. He returned to hook and cut his way to 69 in the last Test.

England won the series 1–0, the first time they had won a Test series in the Caribbean and Barrington&#x27;s 420 runs (46.66) were an important part of this victory.

===South Africa 1960===
Barrington made six 50s in his first ten innings for Surrey, but then had a string of low scores and was made twelfth man for the First Test against South Africa. This hit him deeply and he told Micky Stewart &quot;They&#x27;ll never be able to leave me out again, I am going to see to that&quot;. He made 126, 63 and 62 in his next three matches and was back in the team for the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, famous for the South African bowler Geoff Griffin taking a hat-trick and being no-balled out of Test cricket. Barrington made only 24 in England&#x27;s innings victory, top-scored with 80 in the Third Test and hit the winning run after being missed in the slips before scoring. He top-scored in both innings in the Fourth Test with 76 and 35 and was dismissed by Trevor Goddard for the fourth time in a row. He failed in the Fifth Test, but England won 3–0 and Barrington ended with 227 runs (37.83). There was no tour that winter, so he went to Rhodesia and South Africa with the International Cavaliers, under Richie Benaud, who taught him the flipper, and he became friends with Bobby Simpson.

===Australia 1961===
Australia toured in 1961 with what was seen as the weakest team they had brought to England for years. Barrington broke a toe early in the season, but recovered to hit 151 not out against Hampshire and played in the First Test at Edgbaston. Here he dropped Bill Lawry and Bobby Simpson at slip and as a result gave up fielding in the slips as he felt it required too much concentration and interfered with his batting. Even so, when John Murray was ill he took over as wicket-keeper. Despite their perceived weakness Australia gained a massive 321 run first innings lead and Barrington joined Ted Dexter in a salvage operation on the last day. To counter his weakness against fast bowling he took the unusual decision to change to a face on stance for the second innings, which he kept for the rest of his career. Dexter hit 180 while Barrington hung on for 190 minutes making 48 not out in their partnership of 161 and the match was saved.

He played another rearguard innings of 66 at Lord&#x27;s in the Second Test and 78 in the first innings of the famous Fourth Test at Old Trafford. He had been ordered by the Chairman of Selectors Gubby Allen to hit out after the tea break and his resulting dismissal saw England fall from 358/6 to 367 all out. In the second innings he was lbw to the part-time bowling of Ken Mackay in England&#x27;s collapse from 150/1 to 201 all out as they lost the Test by 54 runs and failed to regain the Ashes as expected.

Meeting the Australians for Surrey he made 12 and 68 not out (out of 100, the next highest score was 9), then 163, 95, 125 not out, 40, 17 and 78 to ensure his place in the Fifth Test on his home ground. He had fractured his wrist against Middlesex, but played anyway and made 53 and 83 in the draw. He ended with a solid 364 runs (45.50) and 2,070 first-class runs (59.14), but still had to make a Test century in England.

==Under Ted Dexter 1961–64==

===India and Pakistan 1961–62===
In an odd schedule the England team played Pakistan before going to India for a 5 Test series and returning to complete the series against Pakistan. In the First Test at Lahore England made a slow 380 batting second with Barrington adding 192 with M.J.K. Smith until he ran out his partner for 99 and himself for 139 after batting for over 7 hours. Pakistan collapsed suddenly in the second innings and England won a surprise victory by 5 wickets.

In India they played the Combined Universities at Poona and Barrington made 149 not out in 290 minutes, and when he took two wickets there was a pitch invasion as the crowd gave him presents, including a pair of sunglasses, which he used for the rest of the match, even when bowling. The match was broadcast on radio and Barrington became a star, which he played up to throughout the tour with imitations of Gary Sobers and a pompous Colonel, playing football with the ball and putting his fingers in his ears when the crowd shouted &quot;Mora, Mora&quot; (have a go). On a more practical side he forsook local food, living off egg and chips for almost the entire tour and kept an array of medicines to ward off illness (he lost 8 lbs before the First Test). He was a great success in the series with innings of 151 not out, 52 not out, 21, 172, 113 not out, 14, 3, 20 and 48; a total of 594 runs (99.00). He made four centuries in four successive Tests for the first time, but the hosts won the Fourth and Fifth Tests.

Returning to Pakistan he made 84 in the Second Test, but missed the Third due to fibrositis. He finished with 229 runs (76.33) in the series against Pakistan and 1,329 runs (69.94) on the tour, nearly 300 more than anyone else and top of the averages. It was no surprise that he was named the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year 1962.

===Pakistan 1962===
Barrington had a poor season in 1962, tonsillitis robbed him of match practice before the First Test against the visiting Pakistanis and he made only 10 runs in the first three Tests. He was dropped for the Fourth Test, but recalled for the Fifth at the Oval, where he came in at 365/2 and made 50 not out. He made only 60 runs (20.00), but did better for Surrey, making 1,865 first-class runs (49.07) in the season and was kept in the team set to tour Australia and New Zealand.

===Australia and New Zealand 1962–63===
Barrington made 104 against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval (a ground where he never failed to score at least 50 runs in the 10 innings he played there), 219 not out against an Australian XI as the MCC made 633/7, the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and 183 not out against Queensland at the Gabba. He did little in the first three Tests, making 78 in the first innings of the First Test at Brisbane, where he hit 6 fours in 20 minutes off the leg-spin of Richie Benaud and Bobby Simpson, but then took another 210 minutes to make 40 more runs. England won the Second Test at Melbourne and Australia the Third Test at Sydney and it was in the Fourth Test at Adelaide that he came into his own.

He made 63 in the first innings and came in at 2/1 soon 4/2 in the second chasing 356 to win. Barrington looked completely assured and began sweeping the Australian spin bowlers as Benaud, Simpson and Norm O&#x27;Neill all tried their arm. He reached his ton with a pull for six off Simpson over long-on, his seventh Test century and his first against Australia. Barrington finished with 2 sixes and 16 fours in his 132 not out and he and Graveney (36 not out) played out the day with an unbeaten partnership of 101 to make England safe at 223/4. In the deciding Fifth Test at Sydney England started with a 9-hour 321 with Barrington entrenched at one end. The famous Sydney Hill become restless, with Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground. He was out for 101 after 320 minutes.

In the second innings Dexter was determined to declare so he could dismiss the Australians and regain the Ashes, but Barrington made a sluggish 94. The match was drawn, but Barrington made 582 runs (72.75) in the series, more runs at a higher average than any other batsman on either side, and the most by an English batsman in Australia since Wally Hammond made 905 runs (113.12) in 1928–29.

Travelling on to New Zealand the opposition was less fierce (New Zealand would not defeat England in a Test match until 1978). In the First Test at Auckland he made 126 and when the leg-side crowd barracked him he hooked a couple of fours to their boundary, then a six to the off-side when the crowd there shouted &quot;What about us?&quot; In all he hit 15 fours and a six as England made 562/7 and won by an innings. He made 76 in the Second Test to give him six consecutive 50s in Test cricket (63, 132 not out, 101, 94, 126 and 76), an England record he shares with Patsy Hendren, Ted Dexter and Alastair Cook. Barrington made 47 and 45 as a makeshift opener in the Third Test and made 294 runs (73.50) as England won the series 3–0. His 1,763 first-class runs (80.13) was only 18 short of Denis Compton&#x27;s record for an MCC tour.

===West Indies 1963===
With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington&#x27;s achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would be over in three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by ten wickets.

The Second Test at Lord&#x27;s is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England&#x27;s reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord&#x27;s balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw.

Fred Trueman&#x27;s 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell&#x27;s team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For all the excitement provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as this was the kind of cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) were less than what was expected of him. Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called &quot;Running in Hundreds&quot;, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.

===India 1963–64===
The MCC returned to India under M.J.K. Smith, again with a weakened team, but after his last triumph Barrington was keen to tour. He made 80 in 312 minutes in the First Test at Madras when England were trying to avoid defeat and the spinner Bapu Nadkarni bowled 131 balls without conceding a run. The Test was drawn and in a tour match at Ahmedabad Barrington made 72 and broke his finger fielding. He was out for the rest of the injury-struck tour (England were reduced to 10 men at one point and Smith considered calling up Henry Blofeld) and returned to Surrey to organise his benefit.

===Australia 1964===
Surrey made 1964 Barrington&#x27;s Benefit year and with a variety of cricket and football matches, dances other fundraisers he made £10,702, the sixth highest earning benefit at the time, and enough money to buy a newly built four bedroom detached house in Feltham.

Barrington&#x27;s great friend Bobby Simpson led the Australian cricket team in England in 1964, strong in batting, but weak in bowling. The first two Tests were rain-soaked draws and they went to Headingley for the Third Test with Barrington having done littlehis last 10 innings in England had produced 200 runs. Australia had 121 run lead in the first innings. England&#x27;s reply depended heavily on Barrington who made 85 (the next highest score was 32) until he had an unlucky lbw decision and they were all out for 229. Australia easily made 111/3 to win and go 1–0 up in the series.

The Fourth Test at Old Trafford saw Simpson winning the toss and making the first Test century of his career, 311 in Australia&#x27;s 656/8. In reply Barrington made his first Test century in England and his highest Test score; 256 in 683 minutes with 26 fours and adding 246 for the third wicket with Dexter; &quot;It was a spirited reply that captured the imagination, but the inevitable draw meant that the Ashes stayed with Australia&quot;. It is the third highest score for England against Australia after Len Hutton&#x27;s 364 and R.E. Foster&#x27;s 287 and is the highest since the Second World War. Before he started his innings his wife had sent him a telegram &quot;Vincit qui patitur&quot; (he who endures conquers). England made 611, the first time that two teams had both made 600 runs in an innings in the same Test.

A few days later his smashed 83 in 27 minutes at Reading in one of his benefit matches, hitting 7 sixes, breaking the pavilion roof and followed this up with 207 against Nottinghamshire to give him back-to-back first-class double centuries.

In the Fifth Test Trueman took his 300th Test wicket, Geoff Boycott made his maiden Test century and Barrington made 47 and 54 not out, but the rain guaranteed a draw and Australia won the series 1–0. Barrington made 531 runs (75.85)more than anyone else on either side and only Simpson averaged higher with his 458 runs (76.33)as he began the most fruitful period of his career.

==Under M.J.K. Smith 1964–66==

===South Africa 1964–65===
Barrington was made a tour selector and unexpectedly granted permission to bring his wife Ann to South Africa, so she quit her job to join him on the tour. Fears that she would affect his form were put to rest with innings of 76, 24 not out, 169, 2, 169 not out and 82 running up the First Test, where his 148 not out (in 432 minutes) set up a surprise innings victory on a spinning wicket. With a weak bowling attack Barrington&#x27;s leg-spin was encouraged and he took 5/29 and 4/25 against South African Universities.

In the Second Test England enforced the follow on after another Barrington century – 121 – was brought up with a six as he added 191 with Dexter for the third wicket, but Colin Bland dug in for 144 not out as South Africa held out for a draw.

The Third Test at Cape Town saw Barlow refusing to walk after giving a catch to Peter Parfitt and being given not out. He made 138 and South Africa 501/7 after winning the toss. This caused a furore as the England players refused to acknowledge his hundred and were only calmed down by an apology. The matter was re-opened by Barrington who was given not out at 49, then walked off as he had nicked the ball to Lindsay. It made little difference to the game, England made 442 in another draw, but in the South African second innings he took 3/4, his best bowling in Tests. Barrington opened the batting with Geoff Boycott and made 14 not out.

Moving on to Johannesburg Barrington advised Smith to field on the moist wicket after winning the toss, but South Africa made 390/6 and though he made 93 and 11 it was only due to a gritty 76 not out from Boycott that England survived. Against Griqualand West Barrington took his best first-class figures of 7/40 (9/69 in the match) and England went into the Fifth Test needing a draw to win the series.

Trevor Goddard won the toss and South Africa made 502, but too slowly to force a result. Boycott made 117 and Barrington 72 in England&#x27;s even slower reply and the game was drawn. England won the series 1–0, the last team to beat the Springboks until 1997–98. Barrington was the chief scorer with 508 runs (101.60) in the Tests and 1128 runs (86.76) on the tour. He also topped the tour bowling averages with 24 wickets (7.25), but leg-spin was out of fashion and was barely used in the Tests. Even so, he was named the South African Cricket Annual Cricketer of the Year 1965.

===New Zealand 1965===
English cricket was now entirely professional and cricketers like Barrington and Geoff Boycott ground out long, defensive innings for the maximum of runs and the minimum of risk. With slow over-rates, negative fielding and time-wasting, it was thought that cricket was dying a slow death as spectators found other entertainment. The exception was the colourful West Indies team under Frank Worrell and to fit in an extra tour in 1966 South Africa had theirs moved to 1965 and for the first time since 1912 two Test series were played in an English summer, with John Reid&#x27;s weak New Zealand team having its five Tests reduced to three. Barrington was out of form, and had been berated by the Surrey captain Micky Stewart for slow scoring, but was retained in the England team for the First Test at Edgbaston.

This was the most controversial of his career as he played himself into form by taking 437 minutes to make 137 against a poor bowling attack and &quot;almost brought the game to a standstill&quot;. Coming in at 54/1 he spent an hour without scoring even though Mike Smith asked him to hurry up. As if to show that he was wilfully obstinate he hit 2 fours and a six in one over to bring up his hundred after six hours and was the last man out in a total of 435.

Though England won by 9 wickets Barrington was dropped for slow-scoring &quot;for the good of cricket&quot; and the Chairman of Selectors Doug Insole wrote to him &quot;it is the only practical way of demonstrating that we&#x27;re not prepared to condone cricket of the Edgbaston variety&quot;. Barrington was depressed and even considered retirement, but worked on his batting and made 70 and 129 not out for Surrey against the tourists.

England won the Second Test and with Boycott and Dexter injured Barrington was recalled for the Third Test at Headingley. Here he made 163 at twice the speed as his Edgbaston century, struck 26 fours and added 369 with John Edrich (310 not out) in just over a day, Mike Smith declared on 546/4 and New Zealand lost by an innings and 187 runs. His two innings gave him 300 runs (150.00) in the series.

===South Africa 1965===
Peter van der Merwe&#x27;s South Africans were a tough outfit and the First Test was played at Lord&#x27;s. South Africa made 280 and England were 88/3 when Barrington hit the ball all around the wicket, making 79 of the 123 runs scored between lunch and tea before he was run out by the master fielder Colin Bland for 91. Needing 191 to win the second innings he made only 18 as England settled for a draw at 145/7. The Second Test at Trent Bridge was won by the Pollock brothers, Graeme hitting 125 and 59 and Peter taking 10/87, dismissing Barrington for 1 in each innings in their 94 run victory. In the Third Test at the Oval England were set 399 to win and Barrington made 73, adding 135 with Colin Cowdrey to take England to 308/4 when rain ended play. It was South Africa&#x27;s first series victory over England since 1935, their last overseas Test series until 1994 and Barrington totalled 202 runs (33.66).

The finale of the season was the Gillette Cup Final between Surrey and Yorkshire. Barrington had hit 68 not out against Middlesex in the semi-final, his 91 runs with Mike Edwards coming at 10 runs an over, but Yorkshire made 317/4 with Boycott hitting 146 and Barrington&#x27;s 5 overs going for 54 runs. In return he was out to Fred Trueman for a duck and Surrey lost by 175 runs.

===Australia 1965–66===
Mike Smith led the MCC tour of Australia in 1965–66 determined not only to regain the Ashes, but to play entertaining cricket. Barrington&#x27;s mother had been ill and his father-in-law died when he reached Australia. He was in poor form until the arrived at this favourite venue—the Adelaide Oval—where he made 51 and 69 in the MCC&#x27;s 6 wicket win over South Australia. At the MCG he took 4/24 to spin out the Victorian tail and hit 158 in the run chase that the tourists lost by 32 runs, &quot;an innings of rugged, fighting grandeur&quot;.

He made 53, 38 and 63 in the drawn Tests at Brisbane and Melbourne and just 1 in England&#x27;s innings victory in the Third Test at Sydney. The Australians fought back in the Fourth Test at Adelaide with Graham McKenzie taking 6/48 to dismiss England for 241 with only Barrington showing resistance with 60. Bobby Simpson (225) and Bill Lawry (119) passed this before losing a wicket and England were left to make 275 to avoid an innings defeat. Here bright cricket failed them as only Barrington with 102 and Fred Titmus with 53 showed any staying power. Barrington batted for 359 minutes and hit only 4 fours and E.W. Swanton thought he &quot;looked capable of going on for ever&quot;, but Neil Hawke took 5/54 and England lost by an innings.

The Fifth Test at Melbourne was to decide the Ashes and quick runs were needed when Barrington came in at 41/2. In one of his few sustained hitting displays he made 63 off 101 balls then hit Keith Stackpole over long on for six and brought up his century 20 balls later with a six into the South Stand off Tom Veivers. His hundred came off 122 balls and won him &quot;one of the most moving ovations I have heard in Australia&quot;, and the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the fastest Test century of 1966. He was caught for 115 by Wally Grout who told Doug Walters to bowl him a ball down the leg so that he could move over and catch the glance. England made 485/9, but a day was lost to rain and Bob Cowper made 307 to ensure a draw.

Barrington made a series total of 464 (66.28), topped the England averages again and with 946 runs (67.57) and 6 wickets (24.83) and headed the batting and bowling averages on the tour. He was excused the tour to New Zealand and was allowed to return home due to fatigue.

==Under Colin Cowdrey and Brian Close 1966–68==

===West Indies 1966===
Barrington returned to England exhausted after the Australian tour, but had to attend Surrey&#x27;s pre-season training and social functions that gave him little chance to rest. Gary Sobers returned with the West Indies in 1966 including Charlie Griffith who had been accused of throwing by the Australians Bobby Simpson, Norm O&#x27;Neill and Wally Grout. Barrington added fuel to the fire by telling the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that he thought Griffith was a chucker and that he would refuse to play against him. He had been the target of West Indian fast bowling in 1959–60 and 1963 and saw no reason why he should suffer at the hands of a man who was not playing the game fair. This caused a falling out with the West Indian team as Sobers was satisfied that Griffith had a legitimate action and, after all, he had not been called in 1963.

Barrington&#x27;s form was poor, but just before the First Test he made 103 not out in a total of 157/9 against Northamptonshire. At Old Trafford the West Indies won the toss and made 484 and when Barrington came in at 11/1 the West Indian fans called out &quot;Wait till you get to Charlie&#x27;s end&quot;. When he did he pushed back a half volley and was caught and bowled for 5. He made 30 in the follow on, England lost by an innings and M.J.K. Smith was removed from the captaincy. On his wife&#x27;s advice he saw a doctor who diagnosed physical fatigue and recommended a restful holiday, but in the middle of the season Barrington refused.

He played in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s with Colin Cowdrey in charge, but made only 19 and 5 in the drawn match. He was selected for the Third Test, but admitted to the selector Alec Bedser that he was not well and withdrew from the Test series (which England lost 3–1), having made only 59 runs (14.75). He stayed at home for a few days, then took a week-long holiday in Bournemouth. There was no tour that winter and he was able to take a rest, cancel social functions and published his second book with Phil Riley &quot;Playing It Straight&quot;.

===India and Pakistan 1967===
Refreshed after a winter&#x27;s rest Barrington was in fine form in 1967, starting with 26, 62, 63, 95, 41, 60, 82, 14, 84, 27 not out and 32 in the wettest May since 1773 when batsmen were struggling. He captained Surrey to victory over the visiting Indians and was recalled for the First Test at Headingley.

Brian Close had taken over the captaincy in the last Test of 1966 and chose to bat after winning the toss. Barrington survived the early swing to make 93 and added 139 with Geoff Boycott whose 573-minute 246 not out had him dropped for slow scoring &quot;a la&quot; Barrington. India made 510 after following on and England won by 6 wickets after Barrington made 46 opening with his Surrey teammate John Edrich instead of the injured Boycott.

Barrington was asked to open again in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s and made 97 in England&#x27;s innings victory. Returning to number 3 in the Third Test at Edgbaston he was dropped on 0 and hit 9 fours and 2 sixes in his 75, though the team slumped to 191/8 until John Murray hit out with 77 to make England 298 as they won by 132 runs. Barrington made 324 runs (64.80).

In between the series he made 158 not out and took 5/51 as Surrey beat the champions Yorkshire just before the First Test. There he made 148, his first Test century at Lord&#x27;s, and became the sixth batsman to make 6,000 Test runs after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman, Len Hutton, Neil Harvey and Colin Cowdrey. Pakistan were saved by 187 not out by their captain Hanif Mohammed and after Barrington made 14 in the second innings the game was drawn.

Half the England team was dropped for the Second Test at Trent Bridge and after Pakistan were out for 140 Barrington made a sheet-anchor 109 not out in England&#x27;s reply of 252, an innings that lasted 409 minutes and 117 overs on a saturated pitch, which was enough for a 10 wicket victory. Barrington had been ordered by Close to take no chances, but E.W. Swanton wrote that &quot;Barrington grafted away, an automatic slow-motion accumulator...the personification of the modern coldly efficient hyper-professional performance&quot;. Strangely he was defended by the old Surrey captain and big-hitter Percy Fender &quot;I am no advocate of slow scoring...but there are times when the demands of the game, situation and the interests of the side make it necessary&quot;.

Close meanwhile had been found guilty of gamesmanship in a county game and was to be replaced for the MCC tour of the West Indies. He remained in charge for the Third Test at the Oval and he stayed at Ken&#x27;s house so that he could avoid the press. On his home ground Barrington advised him to put Pakistan in to bat and they were out for 216, England replied with 440 with Barrington himself making 142 in 344 minutes, hitting 141 runs in 152 minutes with Tom Graveney and striking 14 fours. His 19 Test centuries equalled Len Hutton&#x27;s total with only Wally Hammond&#x27;s 22 ahead of them, and he became the first England batsmen to make a hundred on the six traditional Test cricket grounds of Old Trafford, Edgbaston, Headingley, Lord&#x27;s, Trent Bridge and the Oval. He made 13 not out in the second innings in England&#x27;s 8 wicket victory and his 426 runs (142.00) placed him at the top of the series averages. Hs 2,059 runs (68.63) were the most made in the season, Dennis Amiss coming second in the averages with 1260 runs (54.41).

===West Indies 1967–68===

&quot;We&#x27;re being taken for the biggest ride I can remember – the umpiring, the crowd and Charlie. I promise I won&#x27;t say anything to anybody, but it is downright cheating...this isn&#x27;t England vs the West Indies...Some of the remarks from the crowd are too awful, shouting &quot;kill&quot; at us. I must be bloody mad to come out here.&quot;
:Ken Barrington
Barrington and the MCC fared poorly in the run up matches and with West Indian supporters constantly telling him &quot;Charlie&#x27;s waiting for you man. He&#x27;ll kill you&quot;. Barrington was so upset that told his wife that he wouldn&#x27;t tour again.

In the First Test at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval in Trinidad Cowdrey won the toss and batted with Boycott and Edrich adding 80 for the first wicket and Barrington coming in against the spinners at 110/2. Soon after Gary Sobers responded to the crowd and brought on Griffith, but Barrington twice called him to halt as the chanting of the crowd interfered with his concentration. Although hit with bouncers on the shoulders and back he survived the five over spell and the tired bowler was taken off. He brought up his 50 with a six off Lance Gibbs and added 134 with Cowdrey and 188 with Tom Graveney before hitting Gibbs for another six to bring up his 20th century. When he saw the ball sailing into the stands the 37-year-old Barrington took off his cap and waved his fist in triumph. He was finally caught by Griffith off Gibbs for 143, the second time that he had made a century in four successive Tests. England made 568 and the West Indies followed on (Barrington dismissing Sobers), but survived the last day on 243/8 for a draw.

Barrington made 63 in the Second Test at Sabina Park, Jamaica, again stopping Griffith&#x27;s run up as the crowd went wild. John Snow took 7/49 and the West Indies followed on again, but when the local favourite Basil Butcher was out at 204/5 the crowd disagreed with the decision and rioted, even though Butcher had walked. Tear gas was used by the Jamaican police to restore order and play resumed, but the England team lost their hold on the game as Sobers made 113 not out and the West indies 391/9. Needing only 159 to win England collapsed to 68/8 (Barrington 13), but somehow managed a draw.

The Third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados was another draw (Barrington 17) and the Fourth back at Trinidad looked like going the same way. The West Indies had made 526/7 and England replied with 404, where Cowdrey (148) and Barrington (48) added 133 for the third wicket. Sobers, remembering the England collapse in the Second Test declared at 92/2 leaving England 215 to win in 165 minutes, a run-rate they had yet to achieve in the series. Cowdrey was uncertain, but Barrington convinced him to go for the win, shouting &quot;Will we go for it? Of course we&#x27;ll go for it. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve come all this way for, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Barrington did not bat, but England made 215/3 and won by seven wickets.

Sobers was lambasted by the Caribbean press for his cavalier declaration, but responded in the Fifth Test in Georgetown, Guyana with 152 and 95 not out, Barrington taking his wicket again in the first innings, and England were struggling at 206/9 when stumps were pulled on the last day, but they drew the match and won the series. Barrington had made only 4 and 0, but finished with 288 runs (41.14) and 5 wickets (51.40), having dismissed Sobers and Seymour Nurse twice each and the opener Steve Camacho.

===Australia 1968===
Barrington had flu at the start of the season, made a depressing pair against Derbyshire and withdrew from the First Test due to back trouble, which Australia won. He returned for the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s and made a patient 75 after having retired hurt on 61 with a broken finger from Garth McKenzie. The Queen also asked about his finger when the teams were presented to her, as is traditional at Lord&#x27;s.

In the Third Test at Edgbaston Barrington was out lbw by Eric Freeman and the game was another rained-off draw. Both Cowdrey and Bill Lawry were ill for the Fourth Test at Headingley, and the stand-in captains settled for a third successive draw, with Barrington making 49 and 46 not out. Needing to win at the Oval to share the series the slow-scoring Barrington was dropped, but England won the Fifth Test with five minutes to spare. Barrington was named for the tour of South Africa in 1968–69, but this was cancelled when Basil d&#x27;Oliveira was belatedly included and the South African government refused to allow him to play.

==Interlude 1968–74==

===Israel and Australia 1968–69===
With no winter tour Barrington took up a couple of private tours, he captained the first cricket tour of Israel with Bournemouth &#x27;5705&#x27; Cricket Club, which arrived in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. He made a century and was elected the first president of the Israeli Cricket Supporters&#x27; Association.

After his return he went to Australia with Colin Milburn to contest the first World Double-Wicket Championship, they lost to Gary Sobers and Wes Hall, beat Bobby Simpson and Garth McKenzie, lost to Bill Lawry and Doug Walters and finally beat Charlie Griffith and Rohan Kanhai. At this last game at the St Kilda Cricket Ground in Melbourne on Saturday, 12 October he had a pain in his arms as he was going to shower and collapsed to the ground. He was helped to a chair and then a massage table and a call was made to the crowd for a doctor. As he was taken away in an ambulance to Prince Henry&#x27;s Hospital Charlie Griffith told him &quot;Don’t&#x27; worry Kenny, you&#x27;ll be all right&quot;. Simpson called his wife Ann, who flew in from London, and Ken was given a room with a view of the MCG. He had had a thrombosis, but the heart muscles repaired themselves and he made a full recovery. Telegrams and cards arrived from all around the world and the Chairman of Selectors Doug Insole visited him in hospital.

Barrington was told to take a complete rest and returned to England on the &quot;SS Canberra&quot;, celebrating his 38th birthday with a cake shaped like a cricket bat. It was hoped that he would return to Test cricket, but after consulting a Harley Street doctor he was advised to cut out smoking, sleepless nights and the stress of international cricket, though he could continue to play for Surrey. After reflection he announced his retirement from cricket on 16 January 1969 on &quot;Sportsnight&quot; with David Coleman, having already informed Surrey County Cricket Club and the MCC. The news was met with surprise, but Insole, who had seen Barrington in hospital, had already concluded that he would not play again and wrote his thanks for his &quot;outstanding contribution&quot; to cricket.

===Home life 1969–74===
In 1968 the Barringtons moved to Fetcham and Ken wanted to call the new house &quot;Adelaide&quot; after the Adelaide Oval (where he had made 10 fifties in a row), but Ann objected and they called it &quot;Newlands&quot; after Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town where he had once made 169 not out. After 15 years of marriage Ann found she was pregnant on 15 April 1969, the start of the cricket season just after Ken had retired, and their son Guy Kenneth Barrington was born on 1 November 1969. He was baptised in 1970 with Colin Cowdrey and Harry Secombe as the godfathers and Betty Surridge as the godmother. They took over a local garage – Ken Barrington Motors Ltd – in 1971, which sold Jaguar and Rover cars and which proved to be a profitable enterprise.

===Return to cricket 1974–75===
Barrington managed the Derrick Robins XI tour of South Africa, a multiracial cricket team led by Brian Close and including Younis Ahmed, John Shepherd and Gordon Greenidge in an attempt to restore cricket links with South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town he found that &quot;all the lads I coached twenty years ago are now big businessmen&quot; and he received a warm welcome. He managed another Derek Robins XI under David Lloyd the next year and although the cricket was a success they failed to re-establish international cricket in South Africa and the attempt to integrate cricket in South Africa failed.

==Test selector 1975–81==
Doug Insole used his influence to have Barrington join himself, Alec Bedser, Charlie Elliott and Sir Len Hutton as a selector for the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), which chose the England cricket team. As a selector Barrington tended to favour experience and current form over potential.

===India and Australia 1976–77===
After passing a medical Barrington was chosen to manage the MCC tour of India in 1976–77, where his own legendary status was soon emulated by that of Tony Greig. In the First Test John Lever took 10/70 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test Barrington advised Greig to bat as long as possible so that India would have to bat on a wearing pitch. The England captain took 434 minutes making 103 with a fever, India were bowled out for 181 in the second innings and England won by 10 wickets. Another win in the Third Test gave England their first series victory in India since Douglas Jardine in 1933–34, but it was spoilt by accusations by the Indian captain Bishan Bedi that Lever used Vaseline to shine the ball. After investigation the matter was referred the MCC. Barrington diplomatically thanked the Indian Board for not finding anything averse and was criticised for not defending his players more, but as Lever said &quot;if he had overreacted, the tour could have been called off&quot;.

England lost the Fourth Test to some dubious umpiring and Barrington, while scathing in his official report, declined to publicly voice his complaints to the press. At the end of the tour he was joined by Ann, who did secretarial work for him and the team, and the Fifth test was drawn for a 3–1 series win.

After the India tour the team proceeded to Australia for the Centenary Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a gathering of almost every Ashes Test player from England and Australia. Apart from the cricket the Test was secretly used to recruit English and Australia players for Kerry Packer&#x27;s World Series Cricket (WSC). Tony Greig became a leading Packer recruiter and Barrington was kept in the dark as he would have to report any such activity to the TCCB. Ironically, Barrington secretly gathered guests for Greig&#x27;s appearance on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on their return to England.

===Australia 1977===
The Packer Crisis emerged after a party in Greig&#x27;s house during the game between Sussex and the Australian tourists, at which several pressmen were present. Barrington had long advocated the selection of his former teammate Geoff Boycott and after a three-year exile he was recalled to the England team with great success. With the prospect of losing so many senior players Barrington was also keen to bring in some new players and encouraged the selection of Ian Botham, who he predicted &quot;could become another Keith Miller&quot;. With Brearley&#x27;s shrewd captaincy, Boycott making two centuries and Botham taking two 5-wicket hauls England defeated a divided Australian team 3–0 and regained the Ashes.

===Pakistan 1977–78===
Barrington was chosen to manage the forthcoming tour of Pakistan in the first season of the WSC, both sides losing players as a result. Phil Edmonds and Paul Downton were taken on the tour, Downton on Barrington&#x27;s advice after playing only a few county games. Barrington gave Edmonds long practise sessions in the nets to improve his spin bowling. The team arrived in the wake of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s military coup displacing Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country was in a state of high tension and disorder. In the First Test 40,000 Bhutto supporters rioted at the ground and the teams took refuge in their dressing rooms as the army restored order. The TCCB gave Barrington permission to cancel the tour if he saw fit. Realising this the players urged him to let them go home for Christmas.

In the Second Test England collapsed in the first innings to the leg-spinner Abdul Qadir (6/44), but Barrington bowled his own leg-spin at Brearley and Boycott for an hour before the second innings and their 185 opening stand saved the game.

The Third Test was surrounded by controversy as Pakistan wanted to bring in their WSC players Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad and Imran Khan to win a series victory in the last Test. This would have given them an edge over an England team without its WSC veterans. Several England players led by the vice-captain Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Derek Randall refused to play Pakistan with their Packer players and Barrington and Brearley tried to negotiate between the players, the TCCB and the Pakistani cricket authorities. Matters were made worst by Mike Brearley breaking his arm and returning to England, leaving the uncompromising Boycott as captain and Willis as vice-captain. Fortunately, the Pakistani players could only play by breaking their WSC contracts, which they refused to do, and the Test was drawn. Barrington was out of his depth in these political matters, even though Willis later admitted that his determination for the Test to be played regardless was the right course.

===New Zealand 1977–78===
In New Zealand Barrington saw that the training facilities and grounds were poor compared to those in England, but he praised the New Zealanders for their efforts. &quot;No manager worked harder on behalf of his players nor was better appreciated. Certainly no player on that tour that I spoke to would dissent from this view&quot;.

===Australia 1978–79 and 1979–80===
The tour of Australia in 1978–79 was in direct competition with Kerry Packer&#x27;s WSC and Doug Insole was made the team manager to deal with the social calendar, finances and any cricket diplomacy. Barrington was made his assistant-manager in charge of the cricket, in effect a team coach. The two were old friends and Barrington was more than pleased to have some of the huge workload taken off his back; &quot;I don&#x27;t have to worry about accounts, banks, hotels, functions, team problems, press, Boycott, etc.&quot;

The English WSC players were unavailable so youngsters like Ian Botham, Phil Edmonds, David Gower, Graham Gooch and John Emburey were on the tour with the old hands Mike Brearley, Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Bob Taylor. This gave them an advantage over Australia who had no experienced players in their team, though they had the young batsmen Allan Border and Kim Hughes and the fast bowler Rodney Hogg, who took a record 41 wickets (12.85). The batting was poor throughout the series on both sides, a concern for Barrington, but England won 5–1 and there were no other problems.

===West Indies and Australia 1980===
With Mike Brearley no longer willing to tour a new England captain was needed. Barrington advocated Botham, who at the time averaged 40.48 with the bat and 18.52 with the ball and was England&#x27;s . In the end the appointment failed as Botham&#x27;s form evaporated under the strain of captaincy and his first 17 Tests would be against the two toughest teams in the world; Australia and the West Indies. In 1980 the First Test was almost won when Willis took 5/65 and the West Indies struggled to a two wicket win. In a wet summer the rest of the Tests were drawn, as was the rain-affected Centenary Test at the end of the season.

===West Indies 1980–81===
With its complicated political problems Alan Smith was made the manager of the tour to the West Indies in 1980–81. For financial reasons there was no assistant manager, but Barrington was appointed after representations from the team, though Stuart Surridge asked him not to go as the strain would be too much. He passed a medical, was eager for another tour and had been a teammate of Smith&#x27;s in the 1962–63 Ashes series. He got on well with Botham, who wrote &quot;He would fetch me a cup of tea...sit on the bench in the dressing room, raise a point and we would argue about it. A quarter of an hour later I&#x27;d find myself doing as he said&quot;.

Substandard hotels and cricket facilities, torrential rain and local politics caused many problems. In St Vincent they had net practice surrounded by livestock and they struggled to get food at their hotel in Trinidad. Furthermore, they were up against Clive Lloyd&#x27;s powerful West Indian team including Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft.

In the First Test, Botham put the West Indies in to bat on a damp wicket that recovered and they made 426/9. England followed on and despite extra rain failed to hold out for a draw. Barrington wrote: &quot;The boys tried hard, but one or two did not apply themselves. Hence the same old story. Lack of first-class batting and application&quot;.

In Guyana the Bourda cricket ground was flooded for days and an injury to Willis meant he had to be sent home and replaced by Robin Jackman of Surrey. Jackman had played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup and after a week of increasing crisis, Guyanese President Forbes Burnham decided that Jackman had to be deported under the Gleneagles Agreement. Barrington was incredulous, and in another malapropism said, &quot;The people wouldn&#x27;t let old Forbes Burnham deprive them of their cricket: 10,000 to watch a practice match today; it could be a real evolution if he tried it&quot;. The TCCB refused to have its team chosen by another country (ironically, it was the South African refusal to accept Basil d&#x27;Oliveira that had led to their cricketing isolation) and the Second Test was cancelled.

With all flights out of Guyana fully booked and Barrington now concerned for the team&#x27;s safety, they even considered using a Royal Navy destroyer to rescue them. Fortunately, seats were made available and they flew to Barbados with great relief. There they had to wait to see if the tour would continue, but the Government of Barbados saw that Gleneagles applied to South African teams rather than individual players and allowed the Third Test to proceed. Ann came to join the team and Jackman was chosen for his Test debut. With the West Indies sent in to bat, Jackman took 3/65 and they were only saved by a century from Lloyd as they struggled to 265. England in turn were out for 122, with Barrington chain smoking on the balcony as the wickets fell, consoling each batsman as he returned to the dressing room. When the day was finished, he had dinner with Ann and some friends, but when they went to bed he had a heart attack at 10:30 pm on 14 March 1981.

==Death==

===Second heart attack===
When Barrington had his second heart attack Ann quickly called the team physiotherapist Bernard Thomas from the next room and ran downstairs for help while he tried to resuscitate Ken. She found Alan Smith in the crowded lobby and they called for a doctor and an ambulance, but by the time they arrived Barrington was already dead. They tried to keep the death a secret until his son Guy could be told at his boarding school, but his body had to be sent to the mortuary via the lobby and the news soon leaked. The England captain Ian Botham was told and he and Smith informed each member of the team in the morning. They had a minute&#x27;s silence at the team meeting before returning to the Kensington Oval, where Barrington had made his maiden Test century 21 years before. The news was announced at the ground and there was another one minute&#x27;s silence at the beginning of play. The England team were distraught and Robin Jackman said he couldn&#x27;t bowl properly as he had tears in his eyes. Unsurprisingly they lost the Test by 298 runs, though Graham Gooch made a fighting 116 in their second innings. He later said
&quot;I had watched Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – as a boy and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor to a lot of us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England selector and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, &#x27;In my day...&#x27;... Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.&quot;
===Funeral and memorial service===

He was cremated on 23 March 1981 in Leatherhead, Surrey and 150 wreaths were received, including one from each cricket county. Surrey County Cricket Club arranged a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral in April 1981, which had last been done for Sir Jack Hobbs in 1964. It was attended by 700 mourners including Ian Botham and the England cricket team, who had just returned from the Caribbean, Lord Home, the former prime minister, Hector Monro, the Minister for Sport, and many cricketers. The service was led by the ex-England captain David Sheppard, then the Bishop of Liverpool, and Harry Secombe sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

===Legacy===
The largest memorial to Ken Barrington is the Ken Barrington Indoor Cricket Centre at the Oval. Surrey County Cricket Club decided in 1983 that as he loved to teach cricket to children they would build a training centre in his name. Prince Charles made the first donation and £1,250,000 was raised by public subscription. Delays in planning permission and the need for further money mean that it was not opened until 31 July 1991, by coincidence the same day as the Surrey vs Essex quarter-final in the NatWest Trophy. The centre was opened by Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and Prime Minister John Major, the last two keen cricket fans, the Essex and England captain Graham Gooch and of course, Ann and Guy Barrington. The centre contains Ken Barrington memorabilia.

Ken Barrington was a keen member of the Lord&#x27;s Taverners and in his honour they named the Under-13 Competition winner&#x27;s silver cup the &quot;Ken Barrington Trophy&quot;. There are Ken Barrington Pavilions at Reading, his birthplace, and Great Bookham. Two roads in Reading are named after him, both being on the site of cricket grounds used by Berkshire County Cricket Club. &quot;Barrington Way&quot; is on the site of Courages Cricket Ground in Coley Park, whilst &quot;Barrington Close&quot; is on the site of Church Road Cricket Ground in Earley.

Many cricket clubs in Buckinghamshire, England conduct children games (&quot;Colts Cricket&quot;) according to a simplified set of rules – &quot;Barrington Rules&quot; – named after Ken&#x27;s fondness for teaching cricket to children.

==Personality==

Thanks to his army upbringing Barrington was very neat in his dress and carefully ironed and packed his clothes, and took great care of his cricket equipment. While waiting to bat he would watch the play or prowl the dressing room with a cigarette and would reflect with another cigarette after his dismissal. He rarely drank and preferred to retire early, especially on nights preceding match days. He was brought into cricket when social class and the hierarchy between amateur and professional was still the norm.

At home he could ill afford to hire mechanics or decorators and as a result become an accomplished car-repairman for his friends and colleagues, his own car was always kept spotless and in perfect working order, and was a keen DIY man. He was always careful with his money and frequently called up the management of a hotel if the room was not up to standard and argued if they charged too much. Barrington was a well known sayer of malapropisms such as; &quot;If you pitch it there you put the batsman in two-mans land&quot;, &quot;That was good bowling in anyone&#x27;s cup of tea&quot;, &quot;The press went through the food like a swarm of lotuses&quot; and &quot;high-philosophy bullets&quot;.

==Playing style==

&quot;Ken&#x27;s batsmanship displayed different qualities which were not so glamorous, perhaps, but no less essential: determination, courage, application and overwhelming dedication to the task in hand...How reassuring it would have been last summer to have seen that familiar figure once again – square-on stance, cap pulled down, sleeves rolled up, jutting jaw, ready for anything that bowlers could unleash.&quot;
:John Major

Ken Barrington started as a free-scoring off-side player, but, determined to regain his place in the England Test team, he opened his stance and became a defensive leg-side player. In the 1960s he was the backbone of the England team, whose batting had proved so fragile to the Australian bowling in the 1958–59 Ashes series, but he was a match-saver rather than a match-winner, always best in a crisis. The selectors, press and public thought that he surrendered the initiative too much to the bowlers, but a batsman of his calibre could not be ignored. He was a great worrier and had trouble sleeping during a Test match or if he was not out overnight, which led in turn to exhaustion. As a batsman he was a nervous waiter in the dressing room and preferred to bat at number three to reduce the tension. He would smoke cigarettes to calm himself down and would watch closely to see how the wicket was playing.

Barrington took his time walking out to the crease and once there he would inspect the pitch and subject it to &quot;incessant prodding&quot;, and would hold up play if the captain changed the field so that he could inspect it. A nervous starter he would make 20–30 runs quickly enough, but gave chances to the bowlers, who tried to take advantage of this. Once settled he would slow down and would sink into lethargy until he neared his century, which four times in Tests he brought it up with a massive pull for six. Yet there was method even in this, fielding captains tended to add close-fielders in the &#x27;nervous nineties&#x27;, so Barrington just hit the ball over their heads into the outfield.
After his initial failure as a Test batsman in 1955 Barrington &quot;set out to eliminate fun from his game and replace it with something very near impregnability&quot;. Ian Chappell wrote with feeling &quot;Every so often you encounter a player whose bat seems about a yard wide. It&#x27;s not, of course. It just seems that way. England&#x27;s Ken Barrington was one. Our own Bill Lawry was another. Gee, they were hard to dislodge&quot;. This was not always appreciated by the selectors, spectators and the press. This lack of appreciation may have been affected by the fact that he scored most of his centuries overseas and that he could play entertaining strokes, but chose not to do so.

He was controversially dropped from the England team after 57 Tests for taking over seven hours to make 137 against a weak New Zealand attack in 1965. But when quick runs were needed in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1965–66 he surprised everyone by smashing a hundred off 122 balls and bringing up the century with a six into the stands. Though he rarely expressed open dissent he used to pull faces if he disagreed with an umpire or thought that the light was too bad or the bouncers too frequent. His grimacing and nervous jump when receiving hostile fast bowling led some to believe that he was afraid, but he stood up to Wes Hall, Chester Watson, Charlie Griffith and Peter Pollock even when injured.
His square stance made the cover drive difficult and Barrington eliminated it from his scoring strokes Even so, bowlers attacked the off-stump, as Richie Benaud explained &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that he was weak there, but merely he was less strong&quot;.

Barrington never lost his ability as a spinner, and it made him very effective against spin bowling, especially that of Benaud. His Surrey teammate Jim Laker wrote &quot;His concentration was such that when facing slow bowlers, he would actually watch the ball spinning in the air and play it accordingly&quot;. His one weakness that he was not a good runner, he seldom wanted to relinquish the strike and thought quick singles tired a batsman out. Sometimes a keen batting partner would rush up the wicket only to find Barrington waiting for him to scramble back. John Edrich called him &quot;the worst in the world&quot;, and his West Country accent meant that &quot;won&quot; (one or run) and &quot;wait&quot; sounded alike.

His greatest strength was that he was a good tourist, averaging 69.18 in Tests abroad, though his home average of 50.71 was hardly negligible. He also made 14 of his 20 Test hundreds in foreign fields, which led to his being appreciated overseas more than he was at home. His good humour when playing to the crowd won him widespread admiration in Australia and hero-worship in India.

He holds the record for facing the highest number of balls in a single test match when batting at number four in Test history(624)

As a selector Barrington watched some 80 days of county cricket each year to check new talent and help choose the team. From 1976 he was the manager or assistant-manager in every England tour. In those days a manager led the social side of the tour with speeches and dinners, which initially caused him some difficulty, relations with the local cricketing authorities, umpires and the TCCB as well as coaching and training the side. His strengths were that he had toured these countries before, had contacts, a natural good humour and was an excellent ambassador for the game he loved. As a coach few were better at fielding practice and helping batsmen with their technique in the nets. While he did not coach bowlers so well he could guide them through the weaknesses of the opposition batsmen and general strategy. Although he often grumbled to his team and off the cuff to the English press he was always diplomatic in his official statements. He was an avuncular figure popular with the England players who held him in great respect and called him &#x27;the Colonel&#x27;, but could also tease him and &quot;eagerly awaited the traditional Barrington reaction of hands on hips, eyes cast in the air and a resigned shake of the head&quot;.

==Test centuries==
Ken Barrington made 20 Test centuries, two short of the then England record of 22 by Len Hutton (the record is now held by Alastair Cook). He made hundreds against all the Test teams of his era, but less than a third of them in England, which partially accounts for his greater reputation abroad than at home. Barrington&#x27;s granite-like hundreds ensured that England only lost one Test in which he made three figures, but also won eight, belying his reputation as a match-saver rather than a match-winner, and most of them by huge margins; four by an innings, one by 256 runs and three by 10, 9, and 8 wickets. Barrington twice made centuries in four successive Tests, against Pakistan and Indian in 1961–62 and Pakistan and the West Indies in 1967–68 and he was the first England batsmen to make a hundred on the six Test cricket grounds with one each at Old Trafford, Edgbaston, Headingley, Lord&#x27;s, Trent Bridge and the Oval.

<text>Ulises Hernán de la Cruz Bernardo (born 8 February 1974) is an Ecuadorian retired footballer, who since 2013 has been a member of his country&#x27;s National Assembly for the governing PAIS Alliance.

A defender, he played 101 times for the Ecuador national team between 1995 and 2010, and was selected for two FIFA World Cup tournaments. He spent his club career at Deportivo Quito, Barcelona S.C., Aucas, Cruzeiro, Hibernian, Aston Villa, Reading and Birmingham City.

De la Cruz has set up a charity, Friends of FundeCruz, in his home village to fund a number of projects serving the local community.

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
De la Cruz was born in Piquiucho, Carchi. His first team was the Ecuadorian side Deportivo Quito, for whom he started playing at the age of 16 in the junior division, and later the professional division. Nonetheless, De la Cruz&#x27;s breakthrough season was with LDU Quito in 1998. He scored three goals in the final against Emelec (7–0).

=== Hibernian ===
Alex McLeish, the manager of Scottish Premier League club Hibernian, watched de la Cruz play in international matches for Ecuador, and then signed him in June 2001 for a club record fee of £700,000. De la Cruz scored two goals for Hibs, both coming in an Edinburgh derby match against Hibs&#x27; local rivals Hearts. He only played for Hibs in one season, before he was sold after de la Cruz played in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. De la Cruz said before the tournament that he wanted to use the World Cup as a showcase, desiring a move to Spain or Italy.

=== Aston Villa ===
De la Cruz was signed by Graham Taylor for Aston Villa ahead of the 2002–03 season. He previously made hints of leaving the club, feeling that joining Aston Villa is one of the highlights of his career. LDU Quito claimed that Hibernian failed to pay them a sell-on fee, but this was settled by agreement. Having made his debut, De la Cruz expressed his delight, playing in the Premier League and soon became a fan favourite at Aston Villa.

In his first season at the club, he played 24 times, scoring one league goal against Charlton Athletic. He featured more in the 2003–04 season after David O&#x27;Leary took over, and an injury to Mark Delaney ensured that de la Cruz could start more games than he had previously; he signed a new contract for the 2004–05 campaign.

During his third season with Aston Villa, de la Cruz became frustrated at his lack of first team opportunities and accused O&#x27;Leary of blocking transfers for him.

=== Reading ===
On 25 August 2006, he signed a one-year deal with Reading on a free transfer. De la Cruz scored his first Reading goal against Sheffield United in a 3–1 win on 20 January 2007. After an impressive first season with Reading, he was offered a contract that would tie him to the Madejski Stadium for two more years. Following their relegation from the Premier League, Reading announced on 16 May 2008 that he would not be offered a new contract.

=== Birmingham City ===
After a few weeks&#x27; training with the club, de la Cruz signed a one-month contract with Birmingham City of the Football League Championship in March 2009. The player was initially given squad number 27, previously allocated to Krystian Pearce who had been loaned out for the season; however the Football League ruled that the number could not be re-used and De la Cruz was given number 36 instead. He made his Birmingham debut as a second-half substitute in the 2–0 win away at Doncaster Rovers on 14 March. When his contract expired, the player chose not to accept the offer of an extension until the end of the season.

=== LDU Quito ===
Following his release, de la Cruz returned to Ecuador to play for FIFA World Club Cup runner-up LDU Quito, his third spell at the club. De la Cruz played in both 2009 Recopa Sudamericana matches against Internacional. LDU Quito won the Recopa, giving De la Cruz his first international title.

=== Retirement ===
In February 2013, de la Cruz announced he would retire from football and devote his time to politics in Ecuador. De la Cruz was given a farewell match.

== International career ==
Although not always a first choice for his club, he remained an important member of the Ecuador national team. De la Cruz won 101 caps for his country, between May 1995 and May 2010. He was a fixture in the Ecuadorian team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which reached the second round.

In his homeland, de la Cruz is one of Ecuador&#x27;s most popular players, both for his footballing talent and his charitable projects. The Supporters&#x27; Trust at Reading (&quot;STAR&quot;) organised a facility to allow supporters the means to donate to the Ulises de la Cruz Foundation.

Due to Ecuador&#x27;s poor start in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, de la Cruz and his teammate, Ivan Hurtado sharply criticised the coach and the atmosphere in the team. As a result, they were excluded from selection for the last two matches of 2007 against Paraguay and Peru.

== Charitable work ==
Born in Piquiucho, a small village in the Valle del Chota, one of Ecuador&#x27;s poorest regions, De la Cruz set up the charity Friends of FundeCruz to fund a number of projects serving the local community, to which he donates about 10% of his salary. Friends of FundeCruz is also a British registered charity. At one of the Reading matches, fans were asked to donate money to his fund and he raised a few thousand pounds. Money would also be raised at the Ruta del Sol in February 2008. The foundation funds amongst other things a water treatment plant, a health centre and a sports ground. De la Cruz has been named a UNICEF ambassador.

==Political career==
In the Ecuadorian general election of 2013, De la Cruz was chosen as member of the National Assembly for Carchi Province. De la Cruz serves as member of PAIS Alliance. Agustín Delgado and Iván Hurtado, former team-mates of De la Cruz for the national team, also serve for the PAIS Alliance in the National Assembly.

<text>Steven Leroy DeBerg (born January 19, 1954) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 years.

==Early life==
DeBerg is an alumnus of Savanna High School in Anaheim, California. He was the starting quarterback, and excelled in the pole vault.

He was the starting quarterback at Fullerton College during the 1972 and 1973 seasons. As a sophomore in 1973, DeBerg led his team to a South Coast Conference title with a 5–0 record. In the postseason, Fullerton defeated San Diego City College 24–0 but lost 29–20 to Los Angeles City College in the state semifinals. DeBerg ended the season with an overall record of 10–1–0, and received Junior College All-American honors.

He transferred to San José State University in 1974, and became the Spartans&#x27; starting quarterback in 1976. DeBerg led his team to a Pacific Coast Athletic Association (Big West Conference) title, and was named the PCAA offensive player of the year. He set nine school records, completing 141 of 262 attempts for 2,084 yards, 19 touchdowns, and six interceptions.

In 1993, DeBerg was inducted into the California Community College&#x27;s Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Eight years later, he was inducted into the San Jose State University Ring of Honor and Sports Hall of Fame.

===College statistics (NCAA)===
==Professional playing career==
Although large portions of his professional career were spent as a backup, DeBerg accumulated significant NFL statistics (particularly during the early 1990s, when he was the starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs). DeBerg played for the San Francisco 49ers (1978–1980), Denver Broncos (1981–1983), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1984–1987, 1992, 1993), Kansas City Chiefs (1988–1991), Miami Dolphins (1993), and Atlanta Falcons (1998). He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the tenth round (275th overall) of the 1977 NFL draft, but was waived before the start of the season when he could not displace fellow rookie quarterback Glenn Carano.

DeBerg has been called one of the best play-action pass quarterbacks of all time. Peyton Manning has studied films of DeBerg&#x27;s play-action technique. He played through injuries; ill with laryngitis, he wore a portable amplifier during regular-season games with San Francisco.

===1977–1980: San Francisco 49ers===
On September 14, 1977, DeBerg was signed to the San Francisco 49ers&#x27; practice squad.

DeBerg was tapped to be the starting quarterback for the 1978 season. He started eleven of the sixteen games for the team, which saw him go 1–10 as a starter. He threw for 1,570 total yards in twelve games for eight touchdowns to 22 interceptions. The following year would be the first for the 49ers with head coach Bill Walsh, who would soon institute a West Coast Offense while also drafting Joe Montana in the third round of the 1979 NFL draft. DeBerg threw all but 24 passes thrown by a quarterback for the 49ers that season, which included 15 starts and one appearance replacing Montana as a starter. He posted his first 100.0 passer rating as a starter (one of two 49ers&#x27; wins all year) against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. DeBerg finished the game with 22 completions in 30 pass attempts (a season-high 73.3-percent completion rate), with one touchdown and no interceptions. DeBerg threw for 3,652 yards with 17 touchdowns and 21 interceptions as the team went 2–14. DeBerg led the NFL in completions (347) and pass attempts (578). He ranked fifth in the league in passing yards.

DeBerg would start nine of the first twelve games of the 1980 season but was eventually supplanted by Montana as the permanent starter; notably, DeBerg started the first three games of the season with an unusual device born out of necessity: with damaged vocal cords from a hit to the neck during the preseason that left him unable to speak above a whisper, DeBerg would have a speaker, amplifier, and power pack attached to the back of his shoulder pads (with a switch in his helmet and a mini microphone on the bar of his facemask) to call signals and audibles. He threw for 1,998 yards with 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions with a 66.7 passer rating. The Niners won six games, with four being starts by DeBerg; the low point was a five-interception game in a lopsided loss to Dallas on October 12. By this point, DeBerg knew the writing was on the wall for his playing time in San Francisco, once noting that in regards to the organization, “They brought Joe along perfectly...When he played, he was almost perfectly prepared. It was obvious from the time that Joe was drafted that he was being groomed to be the guy. At times it was frustrating...but I knew Joe was going to be a really good quarterback. It wasn’t any secret.&quot; The 49ers traded him to Denver for a fourth-round draft pick.

===1981–1983: Denver Broncos===
DeBerg was traded to the Denver Broncos on August 31, 1981 for a 1983 fourth-round draft pick (#87, Chuck Nelson), rejoining Dan Reeves (who coached him during his short time with the Cowboys). DeBerg was the second-string quarterback behind Craig Morton, making spot appearances while having one start against Cincinnnati in the twelfth week of the season.

DeBerg would make relief appearances for Morton in the first three games of the strike-shortened nine-game 1982 season before being tapped to start the next five games, which he won just one of those games before Mark Herrmann started the final game of the season. In total, DeBerg threw for 1,405 games with seven touchdowns and 11 interceptions with a 67.2 passer rating as Denver went 2–7. In the 1983 NFL draft, Denver acquired John Elway, who had refused to sign with the Baltimore Colts as the number one draft pick. Elway would start the first five games of the season while DeBerg appeared to relieve him in four of those games before DeBerg was tapped to start the Week 6 matchup against Houston. He would win that game and the next three starts, which included throwing for 350 yards with one touchdown in a 27–24 win over Kansas City. Against Seattle, he threw just 10-of-20 before suffering a shoulder injury that knocked him out of the game and as it turned out the remainder of the regular season. In his absence, the Broncos managed to finish 9–7 and qualify for a postseason spot. DeBerg was tapped to start the game against Seattle. He went 14-of-19 for 131 yards with a touchdown and interception while being sacked twice as he was relieved for Elway prior to the game ending, which was a 31–7 loss. In the regular season, DeBerg had thrown for 1,617 yards with nine touchdowns to seven interceptions with a 79.9 passer rating. After the season, DeBerg was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and eventually signed a four-year contract worth $2.5 million.

===1984–1987: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (first stint)===
On April 24, 1984, DeBerg was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a fourth-round pick (#89, Randy Robbins) and a 1985 conditional pick who ended up being a second-round selection (#36, Richard Byrd). He arrived at the club when Steve Young and Vinny Testaverde (1987) were drafted.

DeBerg was the central starter for the 1984 Buccaneers, who posted one of the league&#x27;s more productive offensive attacks when he was the starting quarterback. The 1984 Bucs ranked 10th in the league in total offensive yards, and eighth in passing yards. DeBerg appeared in all 16 games, starting 13 and winning five of the team&#x27;s six victories that year. He passed for 3,554 yards (the second-best of his career), with 308 completions in 509 attempts (both the second-best of his career) and 19 touchdowns against 18 interceptions.

He finished high on the NFL leaderboards for the 1984 season in attempts (fourth), completions (fourth), passing yards (seventh), touchdown passes (ninth) and passing yards per game (eighth). The Bucs earned their first win of the season with DeBerg coming off the bench, a 21–17 victory against Detroit on September 16 in which he completed 18 of 27 passes (66.7 percent) for 195 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. It was one of four games that season in which DeBerg&#x27;s quarterback rating topped 100; the other three were October 7 against Minnesota, October 14 against Detroit, and December 16 against the New York Jets.

DeBerg never passed for fewer than 191 yards in any start that year, and topped the 200-yard mark ten times. His season-high 322 passing yards came on November 25, 1984, in a 34–33 shootout loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

Narrow losses became the norm, as six of the team&#x27;s eight losses with DeBerg were by seven points or less. Tampa&#x27;s won-lost record regressed the following year, but DeBerg started 11 games and played in all 16. He ranked 10th in the league in touchdown passes, completing 197 of 370 passes for 2,488 yards with 19 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.

After starting only two games in 1986, DeBerg was again Tampa&#x27;s leading passer in his final season there in 1987. Appearing in 12 games (with eight starts), he completed 159 of 275 passes for 1,891 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions—his lowest mark up to this point in a season in which he started at least six games. DeBerg finished eighth in the league in QB rating (85.8), his first season in the year-end top 10 for that category.

He also finished in the league&#x27;s top 10 in completion rate (57.8 percent), one of six seasons in the year-end top 10 in that category (1979, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989, 1990). DeBerg made a career-high five touchdown passes in an opening-day win against Atlanta on September 13, 1987, a game in which he completed 24 of 34 pass attempts (a season-high 70.4-percent completion rate) for 333 yards.

===1988–1991: Kansas City Chiefs===
On March 31, 1988, The Buccaneers traded him to the Kansas City Chiefs for safety Mark Robinson and fourth- (#86, John Bruhin) and eighth-round picks (#198, Anthony Simpson). Although he is remembered as a journeyman quarterback, DeBerg passed for over 34,000 career yards and ranks in the all-time top 20 in attempts, completions, and yards passed. His best years were with the Chiefs, when he led the team to two playoff berths. DeBerg&#x27;s best year was 1990, when he had a 96.3 quarterback rating and passed for 3,444 yards, 23 touchdowns, and four interceptions (three of which were in one game).

DeBerg appeared in 13 games with 11 starts and passed for 2,935 yards with 16 touchdowns and 16 interceptions in his first season with the Chiefs, completing 224 of 414 passes. He defeated his old team (Denver) on September 18, 1988, in one of his better games of the year, throwing 259 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. DeBerg&#x27;s best game was against the New York Jets on December 4, 1988, when he completed 16 of 25 passes for 267 yards and three touchdowns against one interception for a 38–34 win.

Turnover issues again temporarily cost him his starting job in 1989. DeBerg threw eight interceptions in the team&#x27;s first three games, including five in one game (against the San Diego Chargers) on September 24. After sitting for two weeks, he briefly returned to the playing field; he then sat for two more weeks before finishing the season by starting the team&#x27;s final six games. Among DeBerg&#x27;s highlights was a 338-yard, one-touchdown, two-interception performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 23–17 loss on October 29. He finished the 1989 season with 2,529 yards passing, completing 196 of 324 passes (a 60.5-percent completion rate), with 11 touchdowns against 16 interceptions.

The 1990 season was DeBerg&#x27;s best. His 3,444 yards were his third-best single-season career total, and seventh in the league. DeBerg&#x27;s 96.3 passer rating was a career high (and third in the league), and he finished in the top 10 for yards per attempt (7.8, fourth in the league and his second straight season in the category&#x27;s top five). He was eighth in the league in passing yards per game and fifth in the league in yards per completion; his previous best was ninth in 1988. DeBerg&#x27;s 23 touchdown passes ranked sixth, one of his four top-ten seasons. He led the league with a 0.9 interception percentage which included a career-high (and team-record) 223 passes without an interception, one of his three top-ten seasons; the other two were 1979 and 1987.

DeBerg posted a career-high 395 yards passing against Denver on September 17, 1990. He seriously injured his non-throwing hand in a loss to the Houston Oilers on December 16, which required the insertion of a pin into his broken finger to keep it straight. For their last two games and the playoffs, the Chiefs ran their offense out of the shotgun formation to protect DeBerg from having the football jammed in his injured hand during the center-to-quarterback exchange. Kansas City won those games to clinch their second playoff appearance in over a decade, with DeBerg completing 44 of 59 passes for 527 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. In a 17–16 loss to the Miami Dolphins in the 1990 AFC wild-card game, he completed 17 of 30 pass attempts for 269 yards with one touchdown and one interception.

===1992–1993: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (second stint)===
DeBerg rejoined the Buccaneers and played with them in 1992. He made two starts that year, both resulting in losses. In 1993, after three games with Tampa Bay, the Buccaneers cut DeBerg leading him to believe his career was over.

===1993: Miami Dolphins===

Shortly after, however, the Miami Dolphins signed him. He was inactive for the Week 11 matchup for Miami before being tapped to start the next week against New England due to injury to Scott Mitchell, who had become the starter when Dan Marino had ruptured his Achilles tendon in October before Mitchell dislocated his left throwing shoulder that left only Doug Pederson in the QB room. With the team at 8–2, DeBerg started the next four games for Miami, which included a win on Thanksgiving Day where the Dolphins pulled off a 16–14 win when they recovered a fumble after their field goal attempt was blocked. However, it was the only win in his four starts (three of the games saw him throw two interceptions each), one of which saw him leave briefly after a hit saw him bleed from a helmet shot to his chin that required seven stitches to go along with a bandage covering his throat before he returned to play after halftime. Mitchell returned to start the final three games of the season, with DeBerg&#x27;s last appearance being in relief of Mitchell against Buffalo, throwing 20-of-35 for 273 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. In total with two teams for 1993, he threw for 1,707 yards with seven touchdowns and ten interceptions. He retired for the first time after the season ended.

===1998: Atlanta Falcons and second retirement===
DeBerg returned to the NFL in at age 44, rejoining head coach Dan Reeves as a backup with the Atlanta Falcons. On October 25, with Chris Chandler unable to play, Deberg became the oldest quarterback to start in an NFL game when he led the Falcons against the New York Jets. In a 28–3 Falcons loss, DeBerg threw 9 of 20 for 117 yards and an interception before he was taken out for Tony Graziani. DeBerg was the oldest player on a Super Bowl roster (45 years, 12 days) when the Falcons appeared in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Denver Broncos (led by John Elway), although he did not play. Coincidentally, both DeBerg and Elway would retire after the end of the game.

On February 5, 2010, DeBerg was inducted into the Rebel Hall of Fame at Savanna High School for his achievements as a starting quarterback in college and the NFL. The induction was held during halftime at a varsity boys basketball game at Savanna High School.

<text>Arrestment, in Scots law, is the process by which a creditor detains the goods or effects of his debtor in the hands of third parties till the debt due to him shall be paid. It is divided into several kinds:
# &quot;Arrestment in security&quot;, used when proceedings are commencing, or in other circumstances where a claim may become, but is not yet, enforceable
# &quot;Arrestment in execution&quot;, following on the decree of a court, or on a registered document, under a clause or statutory power of registration, according to the custom of Scotland.
# &quot;Arrestment of a ship&quot;, for a maritime claim; if the debtor fears a ship will leave harbour, he can apply for a warrant to dismantle the ship.

By the process of arrestment the property covered is merely retained in place; to realize it for the satisfaction of the creditor&#x27;s claim a further proceeding called &quot;forthcoming&quot; is necessary. By old practice, funds necessary for survival were not liable to arrestment. By the Wages Arrestment Limitation (Scotland) Act 1870, the wages of all labourers, farm-servants, manufacturers, artificers and work-people are, with some exceptions, not arrestable.

<text>Reginald John Cobb (July 7, 1968 – April 20, 2019) was an American professional football player who was a running back for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers, leading the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in touchdowns his freshman year. A second-round selection in the 1990 NFL draft, he initially played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, registering his best season in 1992 when he rushed for over a thousand yards and scored nine touchdowns. He was later a member of the inaugural roster of the Jacksonville Jaguars.

==High school==

Cobb was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was a four-year starter at Central High School. During his senior year, he rushed for 1,141 yards and 13 touchdowns, averaging 6.7 yards per carry, and returned 13 kickoffs for 305 yards and a touchdown. He was named to the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; Elite 11, and was ranked the number three recruit in the state by the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot;.

As a member of Central&#x27;s track team, Cobb won the state long jump title, and placed fifth in the 100-meter dash.

==College==
Cobb signed with the Tennessee Volunteers in 1986, part of a stellar recruiting class that included future NFL players Alvin Harper, Anthony Miller, Antone Davis, Charles McRae, and Tracy Hayworth. He redshirted his first year as veterans William Howard, Keith Davis and Charles Wilson handled the bulk of the team&#x27;s rushing duties. Cobb rushed for 90 yards on 15 carries, including a 54-yard touchdown, in the 1987 Orange-and-White Game, and emerged from spring practice third in the running back rotation behind Keith Davis and Vando Davis.

Cobb received considerable playing time in his first game of the 1987 season and made the most of the opportunity, erupting for 138 yards on 25 carries in the Vols&#x27; 23–22 win over Iowa. In Tennessee&#x27;s 38–10 win over Mississippi State, Cobb scored three touchdowns, including a 39-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter. Two weeks later, he rushed for 66 yards and scored two touchdowns, including the game-tying touchdown late in the fourth quarter, in Tennessee&#x27;s 20–20 tie against Auburn. In Tennessee&#x27;s 38–12 win over California, Cobb rushed for 94 yards and two touchdowns, and caught a 25-yard touchdown pass. He rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns in Tennessee&#x27;s win over Georgia Tech, picked up 127 yards and two touchdowns against Louisville, scored three touchdowns against Ole Miss, and finished the season with 144 and 140 rushing yards, respectively, in close wins against Kentucky and Vanderbilt. In Tennessee&#x27;s 27–22 win over Indiana in the 1988 Peach Bowl, Cobb rushed for 146 yards and two touchdowns, including the go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter, to win game MVP honors. For the season, he had a school-record 1,721 all-purpose yards, including a team-leading 1,197 rushing yards. His 20 touchdowns (17 rushing and three receiving) was second in the nation behind Paul Hewitt&#x27;s 24, and tied an SEC record.

During the 1988 season, Cobb missed three full games and part of two games with an ankle injury, and his production dropped to 547 yards rushing and three touchdowns on 118 carries, and 126 yards and three touchdowns on 17 catches. He rushed for a career-high 182 yards against Duke, and picked up 111 yards rushing against Ole Miss before leaving the game with an injury.

Prior to spring practice in 1989, Cobb was placed on indefinite suspension for failing a third drug test. After completing a drug rehabilitation program, he was reinstated just before the start of the season. He rushed for 98 yards and a touchdown in Tennessee&#x27;s 17–14 opening win over Colorado State, and added 78 yards against UCLA the following week, sharing time with rising star Chuck Webb to form a running back tandem that became known as &quot;Cobb-Webb.&quot; In Tennessee&#x27;s 28–6 win over Duke, Cobb rushed for 109 yards and three touchdowns, much of his total coming on a 61-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run. The biggest game of Cobb&#x27;s college career came in Tennessee&#x27;s 21–14 win over Auburn, when he exploded for 225 yards on 22 carries, including a 79-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. In Tennessee&#x27;s 17–14 win over Georgia, Cobb rushed for 106 yards on 20 carries, and scored a key touchdown in the fourth quarter.

Cobb was dismissed from the team prior to Tennessee&#x27;s game against Alabama in October 1989 after he once again failed a drug test. For his abbreviated season, he rushed for 625 yards and six touchdowns on 90 carries. At the time of his dismissal, he was locked in a battle with Florida&#x27;s Emmitt Smith for the SEC&#x27;s rushing title. His 6.8 yards-per-carry in 1989 led the SEC.

During his career at Tennessee, Cobb rushed 445 times for 2,360 yards and 26 touchdowns, caught 33 passes for 360 yards and three touchdowns, and returned 16 kickoffs for 326 yards. His 1,721 all-purpose yards in 1987 remained a school single-season record until broken by Cordarrelle Patterson in 2012, and his 17 rushing touchdowns in 1987 remains a modern school single-season record. His 1,197 rushing yards in 1987 remains the 9th-highest single-season total in school history, and his 2,360 career rushing yards is the school&#x27;s 10th-highest career total.

==Professional career==

In January 1990, Cobb entered the John Lucas New Spirit Recovery Treatment Center in Houston. He was occasionally visited by Tampa Bay coach Ray Perkins, who became one of his advocates. In spite of his past drug use, Tampa Bay took a chance and made Cobb their second-round pick in the 1990 NFL draft. He signed with the Buccaneerss in August 1990. In his first NFL game on September 9, 1990, he rushed 11 times for 43 yards and a touchdown in the Bucs&#x27; win over Detroit. His first 100-yard game came on November 10, 1991, when he carried 21 times for 139 yards and three touchdowns, including a 59-yard touchdown run. Two weeks later, he ran 22 times for 110 yards and a 27-yard touchdown in a close loss to the New York Giants. Cobb&#x27;s best NFL season came in 1992, when he registered four games with 100 or more yards rushing, and finished the season with 1,171 yards rushing and nine touchdowns. In the 1993 season, he had 221 carries for 658 yards and three touchdowns on the ground to go with a receiving touchdown. He did not re-sign with the Bucs after the 1993 season, and became an unrestricted free agent.

Cobb signed with the Green Bay Packers in April 1994. He struggled at the beginning of the season. Green Bay&#x27;s ground attack ranked 26th in the league at the end of September. In the Packers&#x27; loss to Philadelphia on September 18, Cobb scored the team&#x27;s lone touchdown on a 37-yard pass from Brett Favre. He ran for 66 yards on 13 carries in the Packers&#x27; win over Detroit on November 6, and rushed for 78 yards on just 11 tries in the Packers&#x27; rout of Chicago on December 11. In his lone trip to the postseason, Cobb had 12 yards on 8 carries and an 18-yard reception in Green Bay&#x27;s 16–12 win over Detroit on December 31, and was held to just 14 yards on four carries and a 12-yard catch in the Packers&#x27; loss to Dallas the following week.

Cobb was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft. He was released by the team after the first game of the season, however. In May 1996, he signed with the New York Jets, where he played primarily as a reserve, scoring one touchdown on the season. He was cut by the Jets at the end of preseason in August 1997.

==NFL career statistics==
==Post-playing career==

Following his NFL playing career, Cobb entered the scouting profession with the help of fellow ex-Vol (and current senior personnel executive for the Miami Dolphins) Reggie McKenzie. Cobb joined the Washington Redskins administration as a scout in 2001, and subsequently worked for six years as Tampa Bay&#x27;s Southwestern regional scout. He joined the San Francisco 49ers, where he was the team&#x27;s Western regional scout, in 2009. In 2011, he was named NFC scout of the year by the Fritz Pollard Alliance.

In July 2011, Cobb was inducted into the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame. Cobb died in Santa Clara, California from a heart attack due to one of his arteries being 80% blocked on April 20, 2019, at the age of 50.

<doc id="1322877" wikidata="Q1088349" url="?curid=1322877" title="Chronospecies">
<text>A chronospecies is a species derived from a sequential development pattern that involves continual and uniform changes from an extinct ancestral form on an evolutionary scale. The sequence of alterations eventually produces a population that is physically, morphologically, and/or genetically distinct from the original ancestors. Throughout the change, there is only one species in the lineage at any point in time, as opposed to cases where divergent evolution produces contemporary species with a common ancestor. The related term paleospecies (or palaeospecies) indicates an extinct species only identified with fossil material. That identification relies on distinct similarities between the earlier fossil specimens and some proposed descendant although the exact relationship to the later species is not always defined. In particular, the range of variation within all the early fossil specimens does not exceed the observed range that exists in the later species.

A paleosubspecies (or palaeosubspecies) identifies an extinct subspecies that evolved into the currently-existing form. The connection with relatively-recent variations, usually from the Late Pleistocene, often relies on the additional information available in subfossil material. Most of the current species have changed in size and so adapted to the climatic changes during the last ice age (see Bergmann&#x27;s Rule).

The further identification of fossil specimens as part of a &quot;chronospecies&quot; relies on additional similarities that more strongly indicate a specific relationship with a known species. For example, relatively recent specimens, hundreds of thousands to a few million years old with consistent variations (such as always smaller but with the same proportions) as a living species might represent the final step in a chronospecies. The possible identification of the immediate ancestor of the living taxon may also rely on stratigraphic information to establish the age of the specimens.

The concept of chronospecies is related to the phyletic gradualism model of evolution, and it also relies on an extensive fossil record since morphological changes accumulate over time, and two very different organisms could be connected by a series of intermediaries.

==Examples==
* &quot;Bison&quot; (several paleospecies and -subspecies)
* Marine sloths (paleospecies)
* &quot;Coragyps&quot; (chronospecies)
* &quot;Gymnogyps&quot; (paleospecies)
* &quot;Panthera&quot; (numerous chrono- and paleospecies and -subspecies)
* &quot;Valdiviathyris&quot; (no visible change since the Priabonian, 35 million years ago)

<text>Pandit Pannalal Ghosh (; 24 July 1911 – 20 April 1960), also known as Amal Jyoti Ghosh, was an Indian flute (bansuri) player and composer. He was a disciple of Allauddin Khan, and is credited with popularizing the flute as a concert instrument in Hindustani classical music and also the &quot;Pioneer of Indian Classical Flute&quot;.

==Early life==
Pannalal Ghosh was born on 24 July 1911 in Barisal, Bengal Presidency, British India. He was named Amal Jyoti Ghosh with Pannalal having been his nickname. His father, Akshay Kumar Ghosh, was a sitarist. Ghosh received his initial training in music from his father, learning to play the sitar. Two apocryphal incidents in his childhood are believed to have influenced Ghosh in taking up the flute. As a child he had picked up a small flute that cowherds usually played, and on the basis of the education he was receiving on the sitar from his father, he would try to play musical patterns on the flute. The family&#x27;s ancestral house was on the banks of the Kirtankhola river. At the age of nine, while swimming in the river one day, Ghosh found a long bamboo stick that was half-flute and half walking stick. The flute part of the stick was longer than a traditional flute and Ghosh started practising on it. Then at the age of eleven, Ghosh is said to have met a holy man who held a conch and a flute and asked if he could play the flute. When Ghosh obliged, the man blessed him and said that music would be his salvation.

He was married to Parul Ghosh (née Biswas) in 1924 when she was only nine and he was thirteen years old. She was the younger sister of Ghosh&#x27;s friend Anil Biswas who went on to become a celebrated music composer. Parul was a talented singer herself and later became a well-known playback singer. In 1928, Ghosh became a part of the Indian Independence Movement. He joined a gymnasium and learnt martial arts, boxing and stick fighting. As he became more involved in the independence movement, the government started keeping a close watch. Consequently, he shifted to Calcutta at the age of seventeen in search of a livelihood. At the age of eighteen, he started focusing his attention on the flute. Ghosh realised that a bigger flute&#x27;s pitch and sonority would be more appropriate for both classical and light music. Ghosh experimented with various materials including metal and different types of wood, and decided on using bamboo. He finally settled on a flute which was thirty two inches long.

At Kolkata during the early 1930s, Pannalal received musical training for two years from his first Guru, the noted harmonium player and a renowned master in classical music, Ustad Khushi Mohammed Khan, under the traditional Ganda Bandhan form of tutelage. After the sad demise of Khushi Mohammed Khan, Pannalal studied under Pt. Girija Shankar Chakraborty, an eminent musician and musicologist. The strongest influence on his music came from the systematic lessons under the legendary Ustad Allaudin Khan Sahib, from 1947.

Panna Lal Ghosh&#x27;s daughter Shanti-Sudha was married to the flute player Devendra Murdeshwar, who was her father&#x27;s disciple. Their son Anand Murdeshwar, Panna Lal&#x27;s grandson, also made a name as flute player but died at a very young age. Ghosh&#x27;s younger brother, Nikhil Ghosh, was a noted Tabla player and Padma Bhushan awardee.

==Career==

Having assisted in music production while he was in Calcutta working with New Theatres Ltd. In 1940 he came to Bombay to further expand his music career. &quot;Sneh Bandhan&quot; (1940) was his debut film as an independent music composer. The popular songs from the film were &quot;Aabroo Ke Kamaanon Mein&quot; and &quot;Sneh Bandhan Mein Bandhe Hue&quot; sung by Khan Mastan and Bibbo. Pannalal Ghosh jointly scored the background for &quot;Aandhiyan&quot; in 1952 along with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar. He was the first to introduce the seven-hole flute.

===Innovations===
Pannalal Ghosh incorporated what is known as the Teevra-Madhyam Hole which is also known as the Dhruva-Madhyam hole, placed off the centre-line of fingering holes, at the bottom of the flute. Veteran flautist Nityanand Haldipur who is his direct disciple explains that this hole was designed specifically to play the Teevra-Madhyam (‘Ma&#x27; or 4th note) of the lower octave especially in Raagas such as Puriya, Darbari and Bihag where a Madhyam to Pancham meend (glide) is required. It can even give the kharaj ka gandhar (3rd note ‘Ga&#x27; of the lower octave) too. The hold too was changed by the late legend to enable the little finger to reach this hole. For Raagas such as Darbari where the lower octave (Mandra Saptak) is explored in detail, Pannalal Ghosh invented another bass flute with just 4 holes which was almost 40-42 inches long. This additional hole makes the Indian flute playable almost exactly like the Western recorder, which only has another additional rear hole, placed above towards the mouthpiece, that remains closely held by the left thumb. The long bamboo flutes he devised are popularly played by subsequent flautists to render Hindusthani classical music.

<text>Ae (pronounced ) is a village in Dumfries and Galloway, south west Scotland. The village is located on the edge of a human-made conifer forest, and is approximately north of Dumfries.

== History ==
Robert Chambers wrote of the Ae area in 1826, describing it as a moor with a glen (known as Glenae), whose inhabitants were &quot;long famed for broils, battles, and feats of activity&quot;. Chambers wrote that most men in the area were employed in farming and transporting goods on horseback between the village and Glasgow, as well as the cities of Carlisle and Manchester. These &quot;lads of Ae&quot; had a reputation that preceded them, being famous for &quot;cudgel-playing [and] boxing&quot; at every fair and wedding the area held.

The village of Ae is one of the youngest villages in Britain, having been founded in 1947 by the Forestry Commission.

== Geography ==
The village is situated between the Water of Ae and the Goukstane Burn after they have flowed out of the Forest of Ae. The population is approximately 200, with 50 dwellings. Facilities in the village include a public house (formerly the post office), a school and community hall.

Experiments at Ae include successful afforestation of former peat bogs, formerly thought to be unplantable. Plantation has also been established at a height of . The forest consists mainly of Sitka spruce, but there are also larch, Scots pine, and Norway spruce. There is much wildlife, including deer, fox, hare, weasel, woodpigeon, yellowhammer, sparrowhawk, jay, pheasant, partridge and red squirrel.

=== Toponymy ===
In 1787, the area&#x27;s name was written with the ligature &quot;Æ&quot;. By 1826 the name was written as &quot;Ae&quot; which, by repute, is the shortest place name in the United Kingdom. However the Scottish Gaelic name of the island of Iona comprises a single letter, Ì, and there is also a river in the Scottish Highlands called the E.

The name likely comes from the Old Norse word &quot;á&quot;, meaning &#x27;water&#x27;.

=== Mountain biking trails ===
Close to the village is the local area headquarters of the Forestry Commission. The commission has been instrumental in developing a mountain biking centre, which provides access to cycle trails of various difficulty. To cater for visitors, there is a small café and a bike shop.

=== Wheelchair accessible walks ===
There is a long wheelchair accessible circular trail along the Ae riverside from the main car park where there is disabled parking. The path is wide and generally flat and consists of a combination of cinder and compacted gravel tracks with very few low obstacles and slight inclines. The route is suitable for manual wheelchair users, just follow the yellow post markers. There is also the option of parking at the upper/overflow car park, shortening the walk to less than and avoiding the first part of the trail which is shared with vehicles. For the more adventurous with &quot;off road&quot; wheelchairs the yellow trail can be extended by following the green mountain bike trail markers up to Dan&#x27;s pool and back.

<text>Labraunda ( &quot;Labranda&quot; or Λάβραυνδα &quot;Labraunda&quot;) is an ancient archaeological site five kilometers west of Ortaköy, Muğla Province, Turkey, in the mountains near the coast of Caria. In ancient times, it was held sacred by Carians and Mysians alike. The site amid its sacred plane trees was enriched in the Hellenistic style by the Hecatomnid dynasty of Mausolus, satrap (and virtual king) of Persian Caria (c. 377 – 352 BCE), and also later by his successor and brother Idrieus; Labranda was the dynasty&#x27;s ancestral sacred shrine. The prosperity of a rapidly hellenised Caria occurred during the 4th century BCE. Remains of Hellenistic houses and streets can still be traced, and there are numerous inscriptions. 

The cult icon here was a local Zeus Labrandeus (Ζεὺς Λαβρανδεύς), a standing Zeus with the tall lotus-tipped scepter upright in his left hand and the double-headed axe, the &quot;labrys&quot;, in his right hand. The cult statue was the gift of the founder of the dynasty, Hecatomnus himself, recorded in a surviving inscription.

In the 3rd century BCE, with the fall of the Hecatomnids, Labraunda passed into the control of Mylasa. The site was later occupied without discontinuity until the mid Byzantine period.

==Labraunda and labrys==
The first occurrence of &quot;labrys&quot; in English (1901) noted by the &quot;OED&quot; concerns this sanctuary:It seems natural to interpret names of Carian sanctuaries like Labranda in the most literal sense as the place of the sacred labrys, which was the Lydian (or Carian) name for the Greek πέλεκυς, or double-edged axe.
The same root &quot;labr-&quot; appears in the &quot;labyrinth&quot; of Knossos, which is interpreted as the &quot;place of the axe.&quot; The double-headed axe was a central iconic motif at Labraunda. The axe cast of gold had been kept in the Lydian capital Sardes for centuries. The Lydian king Gyges awarded it to the Carians, to commemorate Carian support in a battle. This is the mythic anecdote: the social and political reality may have been more complicated, for such ritual objects are never lightly passed from hand to hand or moved from their fixed abode. Upon receiving this precious, purely ritual axe, the Carians kept it in the Temple of Zeus at Labraunda.

The figure of a double-sided axe is a feature of many coins of Halicarnassus. Coins at the museum at Bodrum bear the head of Apollo on the obverse and on the reverse the name of the reigning Carian ruler inscribed next to the figure of Zeus Labraunda carrying the double-bladed Carian axe.

==Site==
The Swedish Institute at Athens has been in charge of archeology at Labraunda, notably in a series of campaigns in 1948-53, initiated by Axel W. Persson and taken up, after the latter&#x27;s sudden death, by Gösta Säflund, has published its findings in a long series, grouped as four volumes, from 1955 onwards. Reports documenting the archaeological fieldwork have been published in the &quot;Opuscula. Annual of the Swedish Institutes at Athens and Rome&quot;. 

The hieron, one of the best-preserved and most complete series of 4th century BCE structures, contained a series of buildings of unusual construction, ranged on several formal terraces. In its synthesis of Achaemenid and Ionian features it foreshadowed Hellenistic style.

The sacred precinct was entered through one of two marble Ionic &quot;propylea&quot; at the southeast corner of the site. The Ionic temple of Zeus bore a dedicatory inscription of the brother of Mausolus, Idrieus (351-44 BCE); it had a simplified, two-part architrave, and a low ceiling to the small cella.

As of 2018, the site was being excavated by an international team led by archaeologists Olivier Henry and Ömür Dünya Çakmaklı.

<text>2001 saw many sequels and prequels in video games, such as &quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot;, &quot;NBA Live 2002&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K2&quot;, &quot;WWF Smackdown! Just Bring It&quot;, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2,&quot; &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, &quot;Crazy Taxi 2&quot;, &quot;SSX Tricky&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;. New intellectual properties include &quot;Ace Attorney&quot;, &quot;Advance Wars,&quot; &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, &quot;Burnout&quot;, &quot;Gothic&quot;, &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Fatal Frame&quot;, &quot;Ghost Recon,&quot; &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot;, &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;Oni&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Operation Flashpoint&quot;, &quot;Pikmin&quot;, &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot;, &quot;Red Faction&quot;, &quot;Serious Sam&quot;, and &quot;Tropico.&quot;

Three major video game systems were released in 2001: the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo, and the Xbox by Microsoft. Sega, which had been a major competitor in the video game hardware market to this point, ended its involvement in the market after the failure of the Dreamcast. The year 2001 is remembered for its influence on the video game industry with the release of many games recognized as classics. Many video games released in 2001 defined or redefined their respective genres, including hack and slash game &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, first-person shooter game &quot;&quot;, and open world action-adventure game &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, which is regarded as an industry-defining work.

The year has been retrospectively considered one of the best and most influential in video game history due to the release of numerous critically acclaimed, commercially successful and influential titles across all platforms and genres at the time. It was the peak year for the sixth generation of video game consoles, with the launch of the GameCube and Xbox, the latter focusing on online games (following SegaNet the previous year), and the Dreamcast&#x27;s last year of production with Sega&#x27;s exit from console manufacturing. Storytelling and mature themes also became a more mainstream trend. The year&#x27;s best-selling video game worldwide was &quot;Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal&quot;, the fourth year in a row for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series (since 1998). The year&#x27;s most critically acclaimed titles were &quot;Gran Turismo 3&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; in Japan, and &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; in the West.

<doc id="1322918" wikidata="Q1753264" url="?curid=1322918" title="O Antiphons">
<text>The O Antiphons (also known as the Great Advent Antiphons or Great Os) are antiphons used at Vespers during the Magnificat on the last seven days of Advent in Western Christian traditions. They likely date to sixth-century Italy, when Boethius refers to the text in &quot;The Consolation of Philosophy&quot;. They subsequently became one of the key musical features of the days leading up to Christmas.

In the English-speaking world they are best known in their amalgamated form as the hymn &quot;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&quot;.

==Sequence==
Each text, in the original Latin, begins with the vocative particle &quot;O&quot;. Each antiphon is a title of Christ, one of his attributes mentioned in Scripture. They are:
* 17 December: &quot;O Sapientia&quot; (O Wisdom)
* 18 December: &quot;O Adonai&quot;
* 19 December: &quot;O Radix Jesse&quot; (O Root of Jesse)
* 20 December: &quot;O Clavis David&quot; (O Key of David)
* 21 December: &quot;O Oriens&quot; (O Dawn of the East)
* 22 December: &quot;O Rex Gentium&quot; (O King of the Nations)
* 23 December: &quot;O Emmanuel&quot;

In the Roman rite, the O Antiphons are sung or recited for the Magnificat at Vespers from 17 December to 23 December.

==Origin==
The antiphon texts are believed to have originated in Italy in or before the sixth century. Boethius&#x27;s &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot; includes a passage in which Lady Philosophy appears to cite the series:

The underlying reference is to Wisdom 8:1, but the precise phrasing almost certainly refers to &quot;O sapientia&quot;.

There were many later traditions throughout the Middle Ages surrounding their performance, and Amalarius wrote a detailed commentary on them in the ninth century.

The first letters of the titles, from last to first, appear to form a Latin acrostic, &quot;Ero cras&quot;, meaning &#x27;Tomorrow, I will be [there]&#x27;, mirroring the theme of the antiphons. This is formed from the first letter of each title – Emmanuel, Rex, Oriens, Clavis, Radix, Adonai, Sapientia. Such acrostics were popular among early medieval writers, and some scholars have taken this as further evidence for their antiquity, but this view is not universally accepted.
A number of other antiphons were found in various medieval breviaries.

==Analysis==
Each antiphon has the following structure:
* a Messianic title preceded by &quot;O&quot;. Example: &quot;O Wisdom&quot;
* elaboration of the title: &quot;coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching from one end to the other, mightily and sweetly ordering all things&quot;
* the verb &quot;come&quot;
* elaboration of the request to come: &quot;and teach us the way of prudence.&quot;

Below is the traditional Latin text of each antiphon, as well as the English text from the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Common Worship&quot; liturgy.

Each antiphon is a cento of passages from the Bible. In the text of each antiphon below, the passages from the Bible are indicated by underlining, and the quotation in the footnote is from the Vulgate (for Latin passages) or (for English passages) the NRSV unless indicated otherwise.

===&quot;O Sapientia&quot;===

===&quot;O Adonai&quot;===
===&quot;O Radix Jesse&quot;===
===&quot;O Clavis David&quot;===
===&quot;O Oriens&quot;===
===&quot;O Rex gentium&quot;===
===&quot;O Emmanuel&quot;===
==Other Antiphons==

In addition to the seven antiphons above, a number of other O antiphons have been in use over the centuries in different churches: “O Virgo virginum”, &quot;O Gabriel, nuntius cœlorum&quot;, &quot;O Thoma Didyme&quot;, “O Rex pacifice”, &quot;O Mundi Domina&quot;, “O Hierusalem”, &quot;O sancte sanctorum&quot;, “O pastor Israel”. The Parisian Rite had 9 antiphons beginning on December 15, and some other churches had 12 antiphons. A feature of these is that most of them were not addressed to the Messiah. And they were independent of each other, unlike the seven O antiphons described above that formed a self-contained group (as can be seen from the acrostic &quot;Ero cras&quot;).

An English medieval practice was to add an eighth antiphon – &quot;O Virgo virginum&quot; – on December 23, and move the others back one day, thus beginning the series on 16 December. The acrostic then became &quot;Vero cras&quot; (&quot;Truly, tomorrow&quot;).

Given the English origins of this alternative, it has traditionally been the version used in the Church of England (including Canterbury Cathedral) until recent times, and is the version printed in traditional Church of England liturgical sources including &quot;The English Hymnal&quot; (1906) and &quot;The New English Hymnal&quot; (1986). From 2000, however, the Church of England appears to have taken an official step away from English medieval practice towards the more widely spread custom, as &quot;Common Worship&quot; makes provision for the sevenfold version of the antiphons, and not the eightfold version.

The chant repertory knows also other antiphons built using the musical model of O antiphons, but not related to the Advent season - &quot;O doctor optime&quot; (Common of Doctors of the church), &quot;O Rex gloriae&quot; (Ascension).

==Current practice==
In the Catholic Church, the seven standard O antiphons continue to serve as Magnificat antiphons at Vespers from 17 to 23 December. Since the liturgical reforms following Vatican II, they are also used as the Alleluia verses for Mass in the Ordinary Form on the same days. For the Alleluia verses, the Lectionary moves &quot;O Emmanuel&quot; to the 21st, uses &quot;Rex Gentium&quot; on both the 22nd and 23rd, and places &quot;O Oriens&quot; on the morning of the 24th, but the traditional ordering from the 17th through the 23rd is also permitted.

The Catholic personal ordinariates follow the practice for days from the 17th to the 23rd (Magnificat antiphon at Evensong and Alleluia Verse at Mass, either in the traditional order as indicated in &quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot; or in the order indicated in the Lectionary, but also use &quot;O Virgo virginum&quot; on the morning of 24 December, both as the Benedictus antiphon at morning prayer and as the Alleluia verse at Mass. 

Some Anglican churches, such as the Church of England, use the O Antiphons at evensong; often according to medieval English usage, beginning on 16 December. 

In 1986, St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle conceived a special Advent liturgy using the O Antiphons, which has remained in practice every year since.

Use of the O Antiphons also occurs in many Lutheran churches. For example, an English translation of &quot;The Great O Antiphons&quot; appears with the hymn &quot;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&quot; in the Lutheran Service Book . In the Book of Common Worship published by the Presbyterian Church (USA), the antiphons can be read as a praise litany at Morning or Evening Prayer.

<text>Robert Huber (; born 20 February 1937) is a German biochemist and Nobel laureate. known for his work crystallizing an intramembrane protein important in photosynthesis and subsequently applying X-ray crystallography to elucidate the protein&#x27;s structure.

==Education and early life==

He was born on 20 February 1937 in Munich where his father, Sebastian, was a bank cashier. He was educated at the Humanistisches Karls-Gymnasium from 1947 to 1956 and then studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule, receiving his diploma in 1960. He stayed, and did research into using crystallography to elucidate the structure of organic compounds.

==Career==
In 1971 he became a director at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry where his team developed methods for the crystallography of proteins.

In 1988 he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry jointly with Johann Deisenhofer and Hartmut Michel. The trio were recognized for their work in first crystallizing an intramembrane protein important in photosynthesis in purple bacteria, and subsequently applying X-ray crystallography to elucidate the protein&#x27;s structure. The information provided the first insight into the structural bodies that performed the integral function of photosynthesis. This insight could be translated to understand the more complex analogue of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria which is essentially the same as that in chloroplasts of higher plants.

In 2006, he took up a post at the Cardiff University to spearhead the development of Structural Biology at the university on a part-time basis.

Since 2005 he has been doing research at the &quot;Center for medical biotechnology&quot; of the University of Duisburg-Essen.

Huber was one of the original editors of the Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry.

==Awards and honours==
In 1977 Huber was awarded the Otto Warburg Medal. In 1988 he was awarded the Nobel Prize and in 1992 the Sir Hans Krebs Medal. Huber was elected a member of Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts, in 1993 and Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1999. His certificate of election reads: 

==Personal life==
Huber is married and has four children.

<doc id="1322936" wikidata="Q6766682" url="?curid=1322936" title="Mark Bavaro">
<text>Mark Anthony Bavaro (born April 28, 1963) is an American former professional football player who was a tight end for the New York Giants (1985–1990), Cleveland Browns (1992), and Philadelphia Eagles (1993–1994) in the National Football League (NFL). Bavaro was selected to the Pro Bowl for his performances in the 1986 and 1987 seasons and was a member of the Giants teams that won Super Bowls XXI and XXV.

After an All-American career at the University of Notre Dame, Bavaro was drafted by the Giants in the fourth round (#100 overall) in the 1985 NFL draft. He quickly emerged as a starter in his rookie season and became renowned during his Giants career for his blocking, toughness, and receiving skills. After a degenerative knee condition forced him to sit out the 1991 season, he returned to play three seasons for the Browns and Eagles before retiring in 1995. Since retiring, Bavaro has done work as an anti-abortion activist. His brother David also played in the NFL for four seasons.

== Early life and college ==
Bavaro was born in Winthrop, Massachusetts as the second of three children to Wally, a track coach at Chelsea High School, and Christine, who studied to be a marriage and family therapist when her children were in school. Both of his grandfathers came from Italy. His younger brother David also played football professionally as a linebacker for four NFL teams over the course of four seasons. He attended Danvers High School in Danvers, Massachusetts, where he was a high school football All-American. He was a well-rounded athlete who also excelled in track and field at Danvers. After being intensively recruited by several colleges, he chose to play collegiately for the University of Notre Dame. He was recruited by head coach Dan Devine but played his four years under coach Gerry Faust. He played behind star tight end Tony Hunter as a freshman, then missed all but three minutes of his season due to a hand injury. He established himself as a starter as a junior, but grew home-sick and briefly contemplated quitting the team to move back home following the season. After Faust talked him into staying, he won All-America honors his senior season, when he totalled 32 receptions for 395 yards. Bavaro developed a reputation for playing through injuries while at Notre Dame. &quot;He plays with pain better than any player I&#x27;ve seen in my 37 years of coaching,&quot; Faust later stated. He left Notre Dame after graduating in 1985 despite having one season of eligibility remaining (due to the redshirt status of his sophomore season) and was selected in the fourth round (#100 overall) of the 1985 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.

== Professional career ==
Coming out of college, Bavaro was known mostly for his blocking ability and was expected to play the role of a run blocking tight end as a professional. He earned the nickname &quot;Rambo&quot; early in his rookie season due to his intense playing style, quiet personality, and physical resemblance to Sylvester Stallone. After starting tight end Zeke Mowatt suffered a season-ending injury before the start of the 1985 season, coach Bill Parcells, who had called Bavaro the most impressive rookie during training camp, installed Bavaro as the starter. Bavaro finished his rookie season with 37 receptions, 511 yards, and 4 touchdowns. He also set a team record with 12 receptions in one game during quarterback Phil Simms&#x27; 513 yard passing effort against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985. After the game, which the Giants lost 35–30, Bavaro responded in the low-key manner that would typify his career, &quot;[i]t was nothing special, the plays were the same stuff. I don&#x27;t know what they did. I just caught a lot of balls. I&#x27;d rather win, that&#x27;s all.&quot; Bavaro was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team for his performance during the season.

Bavaro continued his emergence in the 1986 season. He remained the starter after Mowatt&#x27;s recovery from injury and emerged as a favorite target of Simms. He finished the season with 66 receptions, 1,001 yards, and 4 touchdowns and was selected to his first Pro Bowl. His 66 receptions broke the Giants record for receptions by a tight end previously held by Bob Tucker (59). Perhaps the most well-known play of Bavaro&#x27;s career occurred in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in 1986. Here is a description of the play taken from a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast in 2005: &quot;On Dec. 1 1986, New York Giants tight end Mark Bavaro cements his reputation as one of the toughest men in the NFL. With the Giants trailing, Bavaro catches an innocent pass from Phil Simms over the middle. It takes nearly seven 49ers defenders to finally drag him down, some of which are carried for almost 20 yards, including future Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott. Bavaro&#x27;s inspiring play jump starts the Giants, who win the game and eventually the Super Bowl.&quot; This reputation as a tough player was further cemented later in the season when he played for six weeks with a broken jaw that forced him to sip food through a straw. He continued to establish his reputation as an excellent blocker during the season, and was described as &quot;the premier tight end&quot; in the league by 49ers&#x27; coach Bill Walsh before the team&#x27;s playoff matchup. The Giants finished the regular season 14–2 and defeated the Denver Broncos 39–20 in Super Bowl XXI. Bavaro&#x27;s third quarter touchdown gave the Giants the lead which they would never relinquish. After the season Bavaro was chosen to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&#x27;s&quot; NFL preview issue for the 1987 season. Bavaro was pictured on the cover in a cutoff shirt holding his shoulder pads over his shoulder, the caption reads &quot;The Living End: Mark Bavaro of the New York Giants&quot;. The cover also featured Bavaro celebrating a touchdown in the trademark manner of his career. Bavaro, a Roman Catholic, would genuflect in the end zone and motion the sign of the cross after each touchdown.

Bavaro performed well during the 1987 season and was again selected to the Pro Bowl. He finished the season with 55 receptions, 867 yards, and 8 touchdowns. In the offseason he underwent surgery to correct turf toe on his right big toe. He followed that season with 53 receptions, 672 yards, and 4 touchdowns in 1988 despite being late to training camp that season due to a contract dispute and his left big toe now being affected by turf toe. After failing to miss a game due to injury in his first four seasons, Bavaro struggled with knee injuries in 1989 and was limited to seven games. He came back to play in 15 games in 1990. The Giants started the season 10–0 and finished 13–3. They advanced to Super Bowl XXV where they played the Buffalo Bills. During the game Bavaro made two key third down receptions to keep scoring drives alive as the Giants won 20–19.

Bavaro struggled with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 because of the injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team&#x27;s coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to ask him if he would consider coaching.

Despite being advised to retire several times by the doctor who worked on his knee, Bavaro managed to secure a contract in 1992 with the Cleveland Browns, who were coached by former Giants assistant coach Bill Belichick. He played one season for the Browns and managed to appear in all 16 games. After the season, he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played in all 16 games again and had 43 receptions, 481 yards, and 6 touchdowns in 1993. After playing one more season for the Eagles he retired in 1995 at the age of 31. Bavaro finished his nine NFL seasons with 351 receptions for 4,733 yards and 39 touchdowns.

In 2011, he was inducted into the New York Giants Ring of Honor.

His career was so influential that ESPN&#x27;s Mark Bavaro Fantasy Football league is named after him.

In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Bavaro to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.

== Personal life ==
Bavaro married Susan Downes in 1987. The couple have three children. His wife attended Seton Hall Law School for one year, but later transferred to Harvard Law School, where she achieved a degree in Law, and is currently a teacher of European History and constitutional law at St. John&#x27;s Preparatory School. After his retirement they lived in Naples, Florida for three years. They currently reside in Boxford, Massachusetts, near Bavaro&#x27;s hometown of Danvers. After his playing career, Bavaro worked as a sales trader for an equity block-trading firm, where he traded large blocks of stocks for institutions and hedge funds. He pursued a career in this field at the suggestion of his former Giants teammate Phil McConkey, who worked for the same company as Bavaro. In 2007, Bavaro was appointed Vice President of DesignCentrix, a premiere Chicago exhibit house. Bavaro is also an avid golfer who considers the sport his favorite pastime.

Throughout his life Bavaro has displayed a humble, low-key, blue collar personality. During the 1986 season, when he emerged as a Pro Bowler, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Frank Litsky described him by saying, &quot;[h]e is a man of few words, even with teammates. Although he earned $90,000 plus an $85,000 signing bonus last year and will make $125,000 plus incentives this year, he lives a Spartan life. He drives a Chevrolet. His everyday wardrobe features jeans and sneakers. He is humble to a fault.&quot; Bavaro is also an anti-abortion activist and was one of 503 people arrested during an anti-abortion rally in 1988. During his NFL career and since his retirement Bavaro has done work as a member of the &quot;LifeAthletes&quot; organization which promotes abstinence; Bavaro was vice chairman of the group during his playing career. He also befriended and followed the career of Denver Broncos tight end Daniel Graham who idolized Bavaro as a child.

In 2008, Bavaro published his first novel, &quot;Rough &amp; Tumble&quot; (), a novel describing the fictional life of Dominic Fucillo in the NFL and the trials and tribulations he faced while playing football.

<text>Keith Alan Byars (born October 14, 1963) is an American sports broadcaster and former professional football player. He played as a fullback and tight end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots and New York Jets. He was selected in the first round by the Eagles in the 1986 NFL draft. He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes.

==Early life==
Byars attended high school at the now-defunct Roth High School in Dayton, Ohio and Trotwood Madison High School, in Trotwood, Ohio.

==College career==
Byars was a tailback with the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1982 to 1985, under head coach Earle Bruce.

In 1984, Byars finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting (behind Doug Flutie) after a season where he gained an OSU record 2,441 all-purpose yards, including a then-school record 1,764 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns. That season featured a game against Illinois (Ohio State won this game 45–38 on October 13, 1984) in which Byars led a comeback from a 24–0 deficit, rushing for 274 yards and five touchdowns, the last with 36 seconds remaining in the game. On his fourth touchdown run, going for 67 yards, he famously lost his left shoe at the Illini 40 but never broke stride. Byars was a unanimous All-American selection, and voted the Big Ten Conference Most Valuable Player. His running backs coach that year was a young Jim Tressel, who would later become the Buckeyes&#x27; head coach.

Byars was a preseason favorite for the 1985 Heisman, but fractured the bone in his right foot near the little toe in preseason practice. He missed the first five games of the 1985 season, and returned too early. He reinjured the broken bone in his second game back and missed the remainder of the regular season. He attempted to return for the Citrus Bowl game on December 28, but injured his foot again in the second Ohio State offensive series of the game. Many observers note that throughout the remainder of his football career Byars was never as dominant a player as he had been in 1984. 

Despite losing almost his entire senior year, Byars finished his college career at Ohio State with 4,369 total yards, 3,200 rushing yards, and 50 touchdowns. His 50 touchdowns remain the second most in school history.

==Professional career==
Byars was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the tenth overall pick in the first round of the 1986 NFL Draft. As a professional, he played running back, fullback and tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles (1986–1992), Miami Dolphins (1993–1996), New England Patriots (1996–1997), and the New York Jets (1998). Byars was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1993.

A superb rusher, blocker, and pass receiver, Byars was a vital contributor for every team he played on. In 1988, he rushed for 517 yards, recorded 71 receptions (ranking him 9th in the NFL), and scored 10 touchdowns. In the Eagles&#x27; 20–12 loss to the Chicago Bears in the postseason, he rushed for 34 yards and caught 9 passes for 103 yards. In 1990, he recorded 81 receptions for 819 yards, the third most receptions in the NFL, rushed for 141 yards, and even completed 4 of 4 passes for 53 yards and 4 touchdowns. In the 1996 season, Byars made his first and only championship appearance, playing with the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. His team lost the game 35–21, but the 33-year-old Byars had a good performance in it, catching 4 passes for 42 yards and a touchdown.

Byars played one year as a member of the New York Jets in 1998. He helped the Jets reach the AFC Championship Game, before losing to the Denver Broncos in his last game played in the NFL.

In his 13 seasons, Byars rushed for 3,109 yards, caught 610 passes for 5,661 yards, returned five kickoffs for 94 yards, and completed 6 of 13 passes for 119 yards and six touchdowns, with one interception. He also scored 54 touchdowns (23 rushing and 31 receiving). His six passing touchdowns are the third highest total by a running back in NFL history. Byars 610 receptions are the 2nd most catches by a fullback and 4th most by a halfback/fullback/running back in NFL history of 2018.

<doc id="1322968" wikidata="Q838947" url="?curid=1322968" title="Common marmoset">
<text>The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), also called white-tufted marmoset or white-tufted-ear marmoset, is a New World monkey. It originally lived on the northeastern coast of Brazil, in the states of Piauí, Paraíba, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas, and Bahia. Through release (both intentional and unintentional) of captive individuals, it has expanded its range since the 1920s to Southeast Brazil (its first sighting in the wild for Rio de Janeiro was in 1929), where it became an invasive species, raising concerns about genetic pollution of similar species, such as the buffy-tufted marmoset (&quot;Callithrix aurita&quot;), and predation upon bird nestlings and eggs.

The whole genome sequence of a female common marmoset was published on 20 July 2014. It became the first New World monkey to have its genome sequenced.

==Physical description and morphology==

Common marmosets are very small monkeys with relatively long tails. Males are slightly larger than females; males have an average height of and females have an average height of . Males weigh on average and females weigh on average. The pelage of the marmoset is multicolored, being sprinkled with brown, grey, and yellow. It also has white ear tufts and the tail is banded. Its face has black across the nose-area skin and a white blaze on the forehead. The coats of infants are brown and yellow with the ear tuft developing later.

As with other members of the genus &quot;Callithrix&quot;, the common marmosets have claw-like nails known as tegulae on most of their fingers. Only their halluces (big toes) have the flat nails or ungulae that most other primates have. Marmosets have an arboreal locomotion similar to squirrels. They can hang onto trees vertically and leap between them, and run across branches quadrupedally. Tegulae are an adaptation for this type of locomotion. Other &quot;Callithrix&quot; traits shared include enlarged, chisel-shaped incisors and ceca specialized for their diet.

==Range and ecology==

Common marmosets are native only to east-central Brazil. They have been introduced into other areas and live within the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Marmosets can be found in a number of forest habitats. They live in Atlantic coastal forests as well as semideciduous forests farther inland. They can also inhabit savanna forests and riverine forests. Marmosets are successful in dry secondary forests and edge habitats.

===Diet===
The common marmoset&#x27;s claw-like nails, incisor shape, and gut specialization reflect their unique diet, which is primarily made of plant exudates and insects. Common marmosets feed on gum, sap, latex, and resin. They use their nails to cling to the side of a tree, and with their long lower incisors, chew a hole in the tree. The marmoset then licks up the exudates or swoops them with the teeth. From 20 to 70% of the marmoset&#x27;s feeding behavior includes eating exudates.

Exudates provide marmosets with a reliable food source in their seasonal habitat. They rely on these foods particularly between January and April, when fruit is not abundant. A marmoset may visit a tree hole multiple times, including those made by other animals. In addition to exudates, insects also prove an important food source for marmosets, making up 24-30% of their food. The small size of marmosets allows them to stalk and ambush them. Marmosets also eat fruits, seeds, flowers, fungi, nectar, snails, lizards, tree frogs, bird eggs, nestlings, and infant mammals. Marmosets may compete for fruit with birds, such as parrots and toucans, and with woolly opossums.

==Behavior==
===Social organization===

Common marmosets live in stable extended families, with only a few members allowed to breed. A marmoset group can contain as many as 15 members, but a more typical number is nine. A marmoset family usually contains one or two breeding females, a breeding male, their offspring, and their adult relatives, be they their parents or siblings. The females in a group tend to be closely related, and males less so. Males do not mate with breeding females to which they are related. Marmosets may leave their natal groups when they become adults, in contrast to other primate species, which leave at adolescence. Not much is known of the reasons marmosets leave their natal groups. Family groups fuse into new groups when a breeding male dies. Within the family groups, the breeding individuals tend to be more dominant. The breeding male and female tend to share dominance. Between two breeding females, though, one is more dominant. In addition, the subordinate female is usually the daughter of the dominant one. For the other members, social rank is based on age. Dominance is maintained though various behaviors, postures, and vocalizations, and subordinates groom their superiors.

===Reproduction and parenting===

Common marmosets have a complex mating system. They were thought to be monogamous, but both polygamy and polyandry have been observed. Nevertheless, most matings are monogamous. Even in groups with two breeding females, the subordinate female often mates with males from other groups. Subordinate females usually do not give birth to fit offspring. Mating with extra-group males may allow the female to find potential mates in the future. Females that mate successfully but lose their young move to other groups and may gain dominant breeding positions.

The breeding individuals in a group need the other members to help raise their young. Thus, the pair behaviorally and physiologically suppresses the reproduction of the other members of the group. Since these suppressed individuals are likely related to the breeding pair, they have an incentive to care for the young, as they share genes with them. In addition, the presence of a related male affects female ovulation. Female ovulation does not occur when their fathers are around, but does occur when an unrelated male is nearby, instead. They also display aggressive behavior towards their mothers, possibly to displace them.

When conditions are right for them to breed, adult females breed regularly for the rest of their lives. Females flick their tongues at males to solicit mating. The gestation period lasts for 5 months, and females are ready to breed again around 10 days after giving birth. Five months pass between each parturition, so they can give birth twice a year. Marmosets commonly give birth to nonidentical twins. Because of this, females are under stress during pregnancy and lactation, and need help from the other members of the family. Infant marmosets instinctively cling to their mother&#x27;s back and do not voluntarily let go for the first two weeks. After that, they become very active and explore their environment. The breeding male (likely the father) begins handling the twins, and all members of the family care for them. In the following weeks, the young spend less time on their mother&#x27;s back and more time moving around and playing. Infants are weaned at 3 months. At 5 months, they enter their juvenile stage, when they have more interactions with family members other than their parents, and rough play helps to establish their future status. Another set of infants may be born and the previous young carry and play with them. Marmosets become subadults between 9 and 14 months old, act like adults, and go through puberty. At 15 months, they reach adult size and are sexually mature, but cannot breed until they are dominant.

===Communication===

Common marmosets employ a number of vocal and visual communications. To signal alarm, aggression, and submission, marmosets use the &quot;partially open mouth stare&quot;, &quot;frown&quot;, and &quot;slit-stare&quot;, respectively. To display fear or submission, marmosets flatten their ear tufts close to their heads. Marmosets have two alarm calls - a series of repeating calls that get higher with each call, known as &quot;staccatos&quot;, and short, trickling calls given either intermittently or repeatedly, called &quot;tsiks&quot;. Marmoset alarm calls tend to be short and high-pitched. Marmosets monitor and locate group members with vibrato-like, low-pitched, generic calls called &quot;trills&quot;. Marmosets also employ &quot;phees&quot;, which are whistle-like, generic calls. These serve to attract mates, keep groups together, defend territories, and locate missing group members. Marmosets use scent glands on their chests and anogenital regions to mark objects. These are meant to communicate social and reproductive status.

==Status==
The common marmoset remains an abundant species and is not currently threatened, but its habitat had been degraded at a fast rate, with around 67% of the Cerrado region cleared for human use in the 1990s and around 80% cleared for cultivation more recently. In addition, marmosets are captured and traded as pets. Though popular as pets, they become difficult to control as they get older and may be abandoned or killed. Common marmosets have also been used for medical experiments. They are used as such in Europe more so than in the United States, and are the most common nonhuman primates to be experimented on. They are used as model organisms in areas of research such as teratology, periodontal disease, reproduction, immunology, endocrinology, obesity, and aging.

== Genome ==
In 2014, a female became the first nonhuman primate, among the New World monkeys, to have its complete genome sequenced. The genome size is 2.26 Gbp, and contains 21,168 genes. Segmental duplications added a total of 138 Mb of nonredundant sequences (4.7% of the whole genome), slightly fewer than observed in humans or chimpanzees (about 5%), but more than in orangutans (3.8%).

<doc id="1322971" wikidata="Q167305" url="?curid=1322971" title="Andenes">
<text>or is the administrative centre of Andøy Municipality which is located in the Vesterålen district of Nordland county, Norway. The village of Andenes is the northernmost settlement of the island of Andøya (and in Nordland county). 

To the east is the island of Senja (in Troms county), and to the west the endless horizon of the North Atlantic Ocean. Andenes Lighthouse sits along the harbor and can be seen for long distances. Andøya Airport, Andenes is located just south of the village, off of Norwegian County Road 82.

The village has a population (2023) of 2,535 and a population density of .
==History==

Andenes was already an important fishing village during the Iron Age. By the early 1900s, it had become one of the largest fishing ports in Norway.

On 1 January 1924, the northern part of Dverberg Municipality was separated to become the new Andenes Municipality, including the village of Andenes, which became its administrative centre. Initially, Andenes Municipality had 2,213 residents. On 1 January 1964, Andenes Municipality was merged with Dverberg Municipality and Bjørnskinn Municipality to create the new Andøy Municipality.

In the early 1980s, the population of the village of Andenes was 3,770, which made it the largest village in Vesterålen. The downsizing of Andøya Air Station and general population centralization in Norway has led to a dramatic decline in inhabitants over the last 20 years.

Tourism has become an important source of income for Andenes in recent years. The town&#x27;s location on the coast by a narrow section of continental shelf has led to the town becoming a major centre for whale watching.

The lighthouse of Andenes is a famous landmark, finished in 1859. It is open for visitors the whole year.

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Andarnes&quot; (from originally &quot;Amdarnes&quot;). The first element is the genitive case of &quot;Ömd&quot; (the old name of the island Andøya) and the last element is &quot;nes&quot; which means &quot;headland&quot;.

During the danish rule, the name Andenæs, was used. But changed to Andenes in the early 1900.

==Air Station==
The construction of Andøya Air Station was commissioned in 1952 and funded in large part by NATO. It was to be situated between Haugnes and Andenes. A DC-3 Dakota of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) undertook the first landing on 17 September 1954. The air station however was not fully operative until 15 September 1957.

In 1961, the 333 Squadron was moved from Sola Air Station to Andøya with their Grumman HU-16 Albatross. In 1969, these were replaced by the Lockheed P-3 Orion. In 1989, the Lockheed P-3C Orion replaced the aging P-3Bs. However, two of the newest P-3Bs were converted to P-3Ns and fly missions for the Norwegian Coast Guard. Besides fisheries, Andøya Air Station has been the largest workplace in Andøy since the 1970s.

In the autumn of 2011, an Orion aircraft from Andenes patrolled the Indian Ocean from a forward base in the Seychelles, supported by 44 personnel and contributing 29 patrols of 8–10 hours to NATO&#x27;s anti-piracy operation. The flights led directly to the arrest of five pirate groups.

==Geography==
The village lies north of the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun is visible from May 19 to July 25. The sun is below the horizon from November 25 to January 28.

===Climate===
Andenes is surrounded by the sea on all sides, which moderates both winter and summer temperatures. It has a climate on the boundary between the subarctic and the subpolar oceanic climates, being mild for its latitude. Summers are very cool, whereas even during the polar night period, daytime highs typically rise above freezing.


==Culture==
Andenes Church is located in the central part of the village. The local newspaper is named &quot;Andøyposten&quot;. Andenes hosts the annual &quot;Rock mot Rus&quot; (Rock against drugs) festival, where young people perform their own rock music as well as better known headliners such as Dead by April, Dimmu Borgir, Kvelertak, Turdus Musicus and Torch.

<text>Arnold were a three piece alternative rock band from London, England, formed in 1996, who released two albums on Creation Records.

==History==
The band comprised Phil Morris (lead vocals, drums), Mark Saxby (guitar, vocals) and Phil Payne (bass, vocals) and played guitar-based music influenced by the likes of Big Star, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and The Who. Originally members of the band Patio, they became Arnold after the former band&#x27;s singer died, the new band named after Payne&#x27;s dog.

They signed for Alan McGee&#x27;s Creation Records in 1997, at a time when the label was riding high on the Britpop-fuelled success of Oasis, and stayed until the label&#x27;s demise in 1999, releasing two albums, the first (&quot;The Barn Tapes&quot;) originally recorded in a barn in Kent as demos for the label, and the second (&quot;Hillside&quot;) much lauded by critics. &quot;Hillside Album&quot; was released on 13 July 1998. They toured the United States in 1998 before returning to the UK to tour with Neil Finn followed by dates supporting Bernard Butler. They subsequently signed for McGee&#x27;s next label, Poptones and were joined by Rob Arriss (guitar and keyboards) and Dave Hill (drums) before releasing the album &quot;Bahama&quot; in 2001.

&quot;Tiny Car&quot;, from &quot;Bahama&quot;, was usd in the soundtrack of the 2001 film &quot;When Brendan Met Trudy&quot;.

Saxby and Payne have also formed a side-project called Little Massive with Rob Arriss, whose album &quot;Dog Gone&quot; was released in 2005.

<text>Hartmut Michel (; born 18 July 1948) is a German biochemist, who received the 1988 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for determination of the first crystal structure of an integral membrane protein, a membrane-bound complex of proteins and co-factors that is essential to photosynthesis.

==Education and early life==
He was born on 18 July 1948 in Ludwigsburg. After compulsory military service, he studied biochemistry at the University of Tübingen, working for his final year at Dieter Oesterhelt&#x27;s laboratory on ATPase activity of halobacteria.

==Career and research==
Hartmut later worked on the crystallisation of membrane proteins – essential for their structure elucidation by X-ray crystallography. He received the Nobel Prize jointly with Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber in 1988. Together with Michel and Huber, Deisenhofer determined the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This membrane protein complex, called a photosynthetic reaction center, was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used X-ray crystallography to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis, revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria and established a methodology for crystallising membrane proteins.

Since 1987 he has been director of the Molecular Membrane Biology department at
the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and professor of biochemistry at the Goethe University Frankfurt.

==Awards and honours==
In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1988, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He received the Bijvoet Medal at the Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research of Utrecht University in 1989. In 1995 he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He also became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2005.

<doc id="1322985" wikidata="Q854060" url="?curid=1322985" title="Lake Izvorul Muntelui">
<text>The Lake Izvorul Muntelui, also known as Lake Bicaz, is the largest artificial lake on the interior waters of Romania; it was created after the completion of a dam built on the river Bistrița. The dam is located a few kilometers north of the town of Bicaz.

The dam was built between 1950 and 1960 and is used to generate hydroelectricity at the Bicaz-Stejaru Hydroelectric Power Station. It has a height of , a length of , and a maximum width of .

It is a gravity dam made of concrete and connects Mount Gicovanu with Obcina Horștei, located upstream of the confluence of the stream Izvorul Muntelui with Bistrița. Geologically it is located in an area with predominantly siliceous sandstones (Tarcău sandstone), the rest being packages of argillaceous shales and a layer of conglomerates. The foundation soil shows a strong cracking.

Its structure consists of 30 high blocks (plots) separated by joints sealed upstream with reinforced concrete wedges and copper sheeting. It is crossed by galleries, ventilation shafts and manholes. The construction has provided rooms that house drive and control installations, equipment for seismic monitoring and tracking the behavior of each element. At the top, there are four 11.5 m wide spillway fields for a 7 m high water blade (equipped with 6 m segment staves) and four bottom clearings equipped with flat valves (2.50 m diameter) in glasses, arranged in series.

The lake has a length of , an area of and a maximum volume of 1,250 billion m³.

It stretches from north-west to south-east, with frequent lateral expansion areas, the most important of which is the one on the Bistricioara river (about 3 km).

Two secondary reservoirs at Tașca and Izvoru Muntelui divert water from the Bicaz and Izvorul Muntelui rivers into the main lake. The Tașca reservoir is located behind a weir type dam with two spill fields equipped with 2 segment staves. The water inlet is continued by a bypass gallery providing the servitute discharge. The second intake is installed where the Izvorul Muntelui stream crosses the diversion gallery, with the stream flowing directly into the gallery. The water accumulated at Tașca is used both for electricity production in the &quot;Bicaz-Stejaru&quot; hydroelectric power plant and for supplying the cement factory in the locality or for other downstream needs.

The hydroelectric power plant is located 15 km downstream from the dam, in the village of Stejaru in the commune of Pângărați. It is a high head type of power plant with reservoir and pressurized diversion (adduction gallery), balancing tower, penstocks, distributors, power plant, powerhouse, stilling basin and tailrace.

Over the years, the power plant has benefited from various repair activities, sub-assembly replacements, automation equipment optimizations and equipment upgrades.

The lake is a tourist destination in the region, especially in summertime, when visitors take the ferryboat from the Bicaz port for a short trip on the lake, and to view Mount Ceahlău on the west shore.

In the 1960s and 1970s there was regular ferry service between the Bicaz port and the villages on the lake shore.

At Potoci, a few kilometers north of the town of Bicaz, there is a biological research facility, equipped with a small submersible used for underwater exploration. The facility was visited by the marine biologist Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1984.

<text>The Cabot Creamery Cooperative is an American dairy agricultural marketing cooperative owned by Agri-Mark. The cooperative has a plant in Cabot, Vermont, but its administrative headquarters is in Waitsfield, Vermont.

==History==
The original plant had a total investment of $3,700 (), which was paid by 94 farmers in proportion to the number of cattle which each owned. The cooperative started out making butter with the excess milk produced, and began shipping its products south. In 1930, it started making cheese. By 1960, the cooperative had 600 member farmers, although the number of farms in Vermont and across the nation was steadily shrinking.

Following a decline in membership, the Cabot Farmers Cooperative Creamery merged in 1992 with Agri-Mark, a cooperative of 1,800 farm families in New England and New York, and was reincorporated as Cabot Creamery Cooperative Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Agri-mark.
In 2008, there were about 400 Cabot farms in Vermont belonging to Agri-Mark.

The Cabot Farmers&#x27; store is located at 2657 Waterbury-Stowe Road in Waterbury, Vermont.

In addition to the Cabot brand, Agri-Mark also owns McCadam Cheese, headquartered in Chateaugay, New York. Established in 1876 by William McCadam in the small community of Heuvelton, New York, the company first gained national recognition winning the first medal at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1894. In 1934, during the midst of the Great Depression McCadam expanded its cheese manufacturing to a facility in Chateaugay, which is its primary cheese manufacturing facility today. McCadam merged with Agri-Mark/Cabot in 2003.

, about 1,200 members were located throughout New England and upstate New York. Faced with a multitude of challenges ranging from low milk pricing, labor shortages and increased operating costs over the past decade, the cooperative lost nearly 400 farms. As of 2021, there are approximately 800 farms in the co-op. The Rochdale Principles remain a part of the cooperative.

Cabot entered into a partnership with Dankin Farm in 2012 for e-commerce and other reasons.

==Awards==
&quot;Wine Spectator&quot; listed Cabot cloth-bound cheddar as one of &quot;100 great cheeses&quot; of the world in 2008. Also in 2008, Cabot Monterey Jack received an award from the American Cheese Society.

==Ownership==
As a co-op, Agri-Mark is a membership organization incorporated in Delaware on April 21, 1980. The members of the Agri-Mark cooperative, who supply Agri-Mark&#x27;s equity capital and directly elect its directors, are not stockholders of record, so have no right under Delaware statutory law to inspect the corporation&#x27;s books and records. Only the directors hold a share of stock, so are owners under Delaware law.

The co-op retains much of the excess profit, up to $150,000 per farmer, as equity in the form of noninterest bearing loans. For farmers departing the co-op, this equity is repaid over seven years. Dividends in excess of the retained equity are returned to the members.

<text>Octavio Zambrano Viera (born 3 February 1958) is an Ecuadorian football coach. He is a former player with international coaching experience. Zambrano has coached in North America, Latin America, and Europe. He holds a UEFA &quot;A&quot; diploma and a USSF &quot;A&quot; coaching license.

Zambrano was a successful coach in Major League Soccer during the late 1990s and early 2000s. His .587 regular season winning record ranks second to Bruce Arena&#x27;s .604, according to the 2015 MLS facts and record book.

==Playing career==
Zambrano was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He was an attacking midfielder and made his professional debut with Unión Deportiva Valdez of the Ecuadorian First Division. He moved to the United States from his native Ecuador in 1980 to attend Chapman University, and later played two seasons with the Los Angeles Lazers in the Major Indoor Soccer League.

==Coaching career==

===United States===
In 1990, Zambrano was an assistant coach to Rildo Menezes (Ex-Santos of Brasil and New York Cosmos) with the California Emperors in the American Professional Soccer League. In 1992, he became both the assistant coach with the Los Angeles Salsa of the APSL and head coach of the East Los Angeles Cobras of USISL. He also coached the successful largely ethnic team from Southern California, LA Salsa U-19, a McGuire Cup finalist and was the 1994 USISL Western Division Coach of the Year. Following his work with the LA Salsa Zambrano was hired as director by the Mission Viejo Pateadores, one of the United States Top Soccer Academies.

He joined MLS as an assistant for Lothar Osiander with Los Angeles Galaxy reaching the MLS Cup final the first year of the league. Zambrano assumed head coaching duties when Osiander was fired early in the 1997 season. Zambrano&#x27;s 1997 team went from last in the conference (3-9) to a record of 15-13, finished the season with 6 straight wins and made the playoffs. The 1998 Galaxy went 24 and 8 and broke all MLS scoring records, ending the year with 85 goals scored and a 2.66 goal per game average, the 1998 Galaxy became the first North American professional soccer team to make it to a CONCACAF clubs final against Cruz Azul of Mexico. Zambrano coached the Western Division All Star Team and the Galaxy 97/98 achieved the record for most consecutive regular season wins (12). But in the playoffs they faltered, falling to expansion team Chicago Fire. Five games into the 1999 season, Zambrano was fired, the Galaxy made it to the MLS final the same year, losing against DC United.

Zambrano re-surfaced as the head coach of the MetroStars in 2000, replacing the much-traveled Bora Milutinović. He coached the team for three years. In 2000, he led the team from last in the East to first, winning the first trophy for the franchise, the MLS Eastern Division championship. For the first time, the MetroStars advanced the playoffs, defeating the Dallas Burn. Zambrano was fired after the 2002 season after failing to reach the playoffs.

From 2003 to 2006, Zambrano served a three-year term as elected Vice-President of FENODE (Ecuadorian/American Sports Federation).

===Europe===
In 2006, Zambrano was hired as the head coach for Tiligul-Tiras Tiraspol in Moldova. In 2008, after successfully taking Tiligul from the relegation zone to a fourth place overall, he left Tiligul and moved to Tatabánya in the Hungarian Soproni Liga. In 2009, he left Tatabanya.

===Americas===
Zambrano was hired by FIFA to write the CONCACAF Technical Report for the Gold Cup 2009. On 3 December 2009 Zambrano was hired by Kansas City Wizards now Sporting KC as assistant head coach, during his two-year term Sporting KC went from a non play-off team in five years, to the league semifinals and within one goal of the MLS 2011 final.

In January 2012, Zambrano was named head coach for Deportivo Pereira of the Colombian Categoría Primera B.
Deportivo Pereira during the second semester of 2012 broke the record of points obtained in a single season by any Colombian professional soccer team since the installment of short tournaments. The team obtained 43 out 54 possible points, went unbeaten at home for 11 months and 20 days and was the highest scoring team in the league and the least scored against. During the first tournament of 2013, after a good start a string of injuries to main players coincided with a failure to secure a victory in four consecutive games and left the team out of the group of 8. In April 2013, the president and owner of Deportivo Pereira Alvaro Lopez Bedoya, opted to relieve Octavio Zambrano of his coaching duties and assigned him those of manager and technical director. Zambrano resigned his position in November 2013.

In June 2014, Zambrano became a TV game analyst for the Ecuadorian International Network Ecuavisa, as a member of Codigo Mundial, the highest-rated World Cup show in Ecuadorian TV; his participation in this show opened the door to take the reins of El Nacional, getting the club out of the relegation zone and into the group of 6, trying to secure a berth into Conmebol&#x27;s International Tournaments: Copa Sudamericana and Copa Libertadores. In July 2015, Zambrano resigned from El Nacional.

In March 2017, it was announced that Zambrano would become the head coach of the Canadian men&#x27;s national soccer team, replacing interim coach Michael Findlay.

Zambrano made his Canada debut with the under 23 team at the Aspire U-23 Tournament in Qatar, where the Canadians defeated Uzbekistan and Qatar to win the tournament. His debut with the senior team was in a friendly against Curaçao on 13 June in a 2-1 in Montreal before leading Canada to the quarter-finals of the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup a month later, Canada&#x27;s first appearance in the knock-out stage of the Gold Cup since 2009.

On 8 January 2018, Zambrano was replaced as head coach of Canada by John Herdman, who had previously headed the Canadian women&#x27;s program. He had lasted just nine months in charge of the program.

<text>UCL&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology is an academic department of the Social &amp; Historical Sciences Faculty of University College London (UCL) which it joined in 1986 having previously been a school of the University of London. It is currently one of the largest centres for the study of archaeology, cultural heritage and museum studies in the world, with over 100 members of staff and 600 students housed in a 1950s building on the north side of Gordon Square in the Bloomsbury area of Central London.

==History==
The Institute of Archaeology had its origins in Mortimer Wheeler&#x27;s vision of a centre for archaeological training in the United Kingdom, which he conceived in the 1920s. Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler, his wife and an archaeologist in her own right, lobbied colleagues and gathered funds to open the institute. The Wheeler&#x27;s ambitions were realised when the institute was officially opened in 1937, with Mortimer Wheeler as its first director. Among its early members of staff were some of the founding ancestors of archaeology in Britain. Foremost among these, apart from Wheeler himself, was V. Gordon Childe, director from 1946 to 1957, but there were many others, including Kathleen Kenyon, excavator of Jericho, initially secretary then the institute&#x27;s acting director during World War II; F. E. Zeuner, one of the founders of quaternary studies and of zooarchaeology; Joan du Plat Taylor, the institute&#x27;s librarian for many years, who was a pioneer of underwater archaeology; Max Mallowan, Professor of Western Asiatic Archaeology (and second husband of Agatha Christie) and Vera Conlon, archaeological photographer and publisher of the textbook &quot;Camera Techniques in Archaeology&quot;. 

Mortimer Wheeler formally resigned as honorary director in 1944 when he became director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India and, at the end of the Second World War, the directorship was awarded to V. Gordon Childe. Following Childe&#x27;s retirement, this role passed to W. F. Grimes, like Wheeler a former director of the London Museum, and best known today for his 1954 excavation of the London Mithraeum. Following Grimes, the directorship has been held by the Mediterranean prehistorian John Davies Evans; the geographer David R. Harris; Peter Ucko, founder of the World Archaeological Congress; the prehistorian and evolutionary theorist Stephen Shennan and the prehistorian Sue Hamilton. It is currently held by Professor of African Archaeology, Kevin MacDonald. Until 1958, the institute was based at St John&#x27;s Lodge, Regent&#x27;s Park, London subsequently moving to purpose-built premises on Gordon Square designed by Booth, Ledeboer, and Pinckheard. The institute taught a diploma until the first BA degree was offered in 1968, followed shortly thereafter by a BSc. The year 2012 marked the institute&#x27;s 75th anniversary, and a number of events and activities were held to mark this occasion.

==Research and teaching==
Research at the Institute covers fieldwork, laboratory analysis and conservation, artefact studies, and theoretical, synthetic, and analytical work. Staff projects are currently undertaken on five continents and in the Pacific. A research directory outlining research projects, centres and networks at the Institute of Archaeology is available on the institute&#x27;s website.
Current research projects include:
* The Stones of Stonehenge
* Rapa Nui Landscapes of Construction
* Cultural Evolution of Neolithic Europe
* Imperial Logistics: The Making of the Terracotta Army
In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the Institute of Archaeology received the top score of 100% 4* for the excellence of its research environment. Two-thirds (66%) of its research outputs were rated in the 4* or 3* categories (world leading and internationally excellent) while nearly 50% of its research impact was deemed to be of 4* quality.

The institute offers a diverse range of Undergraduate Degrees, Master&#x27;s degrees and Research Degrees.
The Institute of Archaeology was rated number one for Archaeology and Forensics in the Guardian University Guide for 2015 for the fourth year in a row. It has also been ranked in the top two for student satisfaction in the Complete University Guide&#x27;s 2015 League Table of UK archaeology departments.

In the &quot;QS World University Rankings by Subject 2016&quot; UCL is ranked 3rd in the world (and 3rd in Europe) for Archaeology.

==Facilities, collections and library==
Part of the Institute of Archaeology since its early home at St John&#x27;s Lodge in Regents Park. Moved to Gordon Square in 1958, initially on the first floor and subsequently relocated to the fifth floor. The institute&#x27;s facilities include the Wolfson Archaeological Science Laboratories and other laboratories for conservation teaching and research, GIS, photography, lithic analysis and for environmental teaching and research activities.

The Institute of Archaeology Collections contain c. 80,000 objects that are used in teaching, research and outreach. Archaeological materials include ceramics, lithics and other objects from a range of periods across Europe, Africa, Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Pakistan, India, Mesoamerica, South America and the Caribbean. Notable collectors include Flinders Petrie (the Petrie Palestinian Collection), Kathleen Kenyon, Beatrice De Cardi, W. L. Hildburgh, R. G. Gayer-Anderson and Mortimer Wheeler. There are also extensive collections of archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological material which act as primary sources for the identification of plant and animal remains. Further collections of minerals, slag and other materials provide teaching resources for the study of ancient technology.

The A. G. Leventis Gallery of Cypriot and Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology is a public display of part of the collections of the Institute of Archaeology, with objects from ancient Cyprus, Greece, Crete, Egypt and the Levant. The gallery is open Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm; entry is free.

The Institute Library was founded in 1937 to support teaching and learning at the new Institute of Archaeology and has subsequently gained an international reputation as one of the most extensive collections of printed material in the world relating to all aspects of archaeology, museum studies and cultural heritage, largely thanks to the work of the post-war librarians Joan du Plat Taylor, Geraldine Talbot and Heather Bell. The library also contains the Yates Classical Archaeology library and the Edwards Egyptology library. The Institute Library is now part of UCL Library Services. Related collections of interest are to be found in the Main Library (Ancient History, Jewish Studies, Latin American History, History and Classics) and in the DMS Watson (Science Library) (Anthropology, History of Science and Geography).

==Publications==
The institute publishes research monographs and edited volumes in association with Left Coast Press who also now produce and distribute older Institute of Archaeology publications.

The institute produces the following &#x27;in-house&#x27; publications (in conjunction with Ubiquity Press):
* &quot;Archaeology International&quot;&#x27;
* &quot;Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies&quot;
* &quot;Papers from the Institute of Archaeology&quot; (&quot;PIA&quot;)
* &quot;Present Pasts&quot;

It also published the &quot;Bulletin from the Institute of Archaeology&quot; from 1954 to 1994 which was superseded by &quot;Archaeology International&quot;.

Current Institute of Archaeology undergraduate students produce Artifact magazine (available online).

&quot;Public Archaeology&quot; is a journal sponsored by the institute, launched in 2000 as an international peer-reviewed journal with a focus on the issues of cultural heritage, community archaeology and archaeological practice as it relates to wider civil and governmental concerns. The journal was originally edited by Neal Ascherson and then by Tim Schadla-Hall. Issued quarterly, it was published by James &amp; James Science Publishers until 2007, when the publishing rights were purchased by Maney Publishing.

==Research divisions==
The Centre for Applied Archaeology (CAA) is a research and support division within UCL&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology which offers professional advice, support and training in cultural resource management, archaeology, conservation, interpretation and project management. Archaeology South-East (ASE) is the contracts division of the Centre for Applied Archaeology and offers services in all areas of archaeological practice.

The International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology, based at the institute, is a joint association between the School for Archaeology and Museology of Peking University and UCL&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology.

==News, events and social media==
The Institute of Archaeology regularly publishes news and events, including details of seminars, conferences, job opportunities, recent press coverage, publications and other announcements. The institute also has a presence on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. An annual open day, a &#x27;Festival of World Archaeology&#x27;, is normally held in June, providing fun, archaeology-related activities for children and adults alike.

<text>James Edward Hasty (born May 23, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, and Oakland Raiders from 1988 to 2001. He played college football for the Washington State Cougars.

==Career==

===Football career===
Hasty was selected in the third round of the 1988 NFL draft (74th overall) by the Jets and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1997 and 1999. He starred at the cornerback position at Washington State University. Known for his aggressive bump and run coverage, Hasty teamed with Dale Carter to form one of the league&#x27;s top cornerbacking duos while with the Chiefs.

==After football==
From 2001 to 2004, Hasty was an assistant football coach for Bellevue High School who won 4 straight State Championships in the state of Washington. In 2010, he rejoined the coaching staff of the Bellevue Wolverines as a defensive backs coach. The Bellevue Defensive Coordinator was headed by Chris Beak who had served in various coaching duties in the NFL himself. In September 2010, Chris Beak re-entered the NFL as an offensive assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers. This led to his taking over as the Bellevue defensive coordinator, where he remained as of 2013.

He started working for ESPN as an NFL analyst on May 3, 2006, where he was also a college football analyst.

==NFL career statistics==
